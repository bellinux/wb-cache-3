These offshoots include fusions with noise music, ambient music, folk music, post-punk and electronic dance music, {{as well as other}} mutations and developments. The scene has spread worldwide, and is particularly well represented in North America, Europe, and Japan. Post-industrial subgenres include dark ambient, <b>power</b> <b>electronics,</b> Japanoise, neofolk, electro-industrial, electronic body music, industrial hip hop, industrial rock, industrial metal, industrial pop, martial industrial, power noise, and witch house.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, the pulsed <b>power</b> <b>electronics</b> {{laboratory}} received $4million {{in federal}} funding. Among other things, {{the money will}} be used to create compact generators for weapon systems designed to destroy improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The College of Engineering’s Nano Tech Center has received approximately $20million in grants toward its work in applied nanophotonics, the creation and manipulation of advanced materials at the nanoscale that can produce and sense light. Texas Tech's Center for Advanced Analytics and Business Intelligence performs grid computing research through collaboration with the SAS Institute that seeks to improve the speed with which large quantities of data (such as those present in genomics and global economics) can be processed.|$|E
5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state <b>power</b> <b>electronics</b> {{conversion system}} consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E

25|$|Optical fiber {{can be used}} to {{transmit}} power using a photovoltaic cell to convert the light into electricity. While this method of power transmission is not as efficient as conventional ones, it is especially useful in situations where it is desirable not to have a metallic conductor {{as in the case of}} use near MRI machines, which produce strong magnetic fields. Other examples are for <b>powering</b> <b>electronics</b> in high-powered antenna elements and measurement devices used in high-voltage transmission equipment.|$|R

50|$|Some taps, {{particularly}} fiber taps, can use no <b>power</b> and no <b>electronics</b> {{at all for}} the pass-through {{and monitor}} portion of the network traffic. This means that the tap should never suffer any kind of <b>electronics</b> failure or <b>power</b> failure that results {{in a loss of}} network connectivity. One way this can work, for fiber-based network technologies, is that the tap divides the incoming light using a simple physical apparatus into two outputs, one for the pass-through, one for the monitor. This can be called a passive tap. Other taps use no <b>power</b> or <b>electronics</b> for the pass-through, but do use <b>power</b> and <b>electronics</b> for the monitor port. These can also be referred to as passive.|$|R

25|$|<b>Power</b> <b>electronics</b> was {{originally}} coined by William Bennett for the noise music {{of his own}} project Whitehouse. It consists of screeching waves of feedback, analogue synthesizers making sub-bass pulses or high frequency squealing sounds, and screamed, distorted, often hateful and offensive lyrics. Deeply atonal, there are no conventional melodies or rhythms. Members of Whitehouse who began other projects, such as Sutcliffe Jügend, also practice <b>power</b> <b>electronics.</b> Death industrial is a similar style associated with groups such as The Grey Wolves, but the term first referred to artists such as Brighter Death Now.
