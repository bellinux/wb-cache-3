25|$|Lawrence is {{best known}} for his novels Sons and Lovers, The Rainbow, Women in Love and Lady Chatterley's Lover. In these books, Lawrence explores the {{possibilities}} for life within an industrial setting. In particular Lawrence is concerned with the nature of relationships that can be had within such a setting. Though often classed as a realist, Lawrence in fact uses his characters to give form to his personal philosophy. His depiction of sexuality, though seen as shocking when his work was first published in the early 20th century, has its roots in this highly <b>personal</b> <b>way</b> of thinking and being.|$|E

It was devised prior to the appointment of Paul Marquess as executive producer. He chose to continue with it, deciding that {{it would be interesting to}} give Steph another serious storyline, and have a character that viewers [...] "know and love [...] going through a really hard time." [...] In preparation for the storyline, Stenson studied the illness to give her a time-line of the experiences Steph would undergo. She chose not to speak with any cancer patients about coping with cancer, believing that everyone handles it in their own <b>personal</b> <b>way.</b> Additionally, she aimed to make Steph's realisation of her cancer as believable as possible, explaining that: [...] "Steph wouldn't have any prior knowledge about what to expect, and I wanted to see it fresh through her eyes". She was flattered to be trusted with the storyline, and found it particularly important to get her portrayal right as, during the previous year, she had fronted the Arm Against Cervical Cancer campaign.|$|E
500|$|Recalling the songwriting style {{she used}} {{when she had}} collaborated with RedOne, Porcelain Black said she would enter the studio with an idea she {{had come up with}} on her own at the piano and play it for RedOne. At other times, RedOne would play a beat he had {{constructed}} for her, and she would listen to it and see what vibes emerged from hearing it. Usually, Porcelain Black creates a song title, then forges the song around that. She finds the most difficult songwriting process to be starting with melody, because making the syllables of her lyrics match the melody produces an effect that sounds forced and contrived. When working with RedOne, Porcelain Black said they would construct the melodies together, but all of the song lyrics were written exclusively by her; RedOne did not contribute to her music lyrically while they were working together on her first attempt at a debut album. Lyrically, Porcelain Black writes all of her own songs. On the topic, she has said: [...] "I write all my own stuff. I don't understand artists that don’t write their own songs. I'm thankful for artists like Britney, but I don’t understand how you can’t write your own music. It's such a <b>personal</b> <b>way</b> of expressing yourself." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Egyptians {{produced}} numerous {{prayers and}} hymns, {{written in the}} form of poetry. Hymns and prayers follow a similar structure and are distinguished mainly by the purposes they serve. Hymns were written to praise particular deities. Like ritual texts, they were written on papyri and on temple walls, and they were probably recited as part of the rituals they accompany in temple inscriptions. [...] Most are structured according to a set literary formula, designed to expound on the nature, aspects, and mythological functions of a given deity. They tend to speak more explicitly about fundamental theology than other Egyptian religious writings, and became particularly important in the New Kingdom, a period of particularly active theological discourse. [...] Prayers follow the same general pattern as hymns, but address the relevant god in a more <b>personal</b> <b>way,</b> asking for blessings, help, or forgiveness for wrongdoing. Such prayers are rare before the New Kingdom, indicating that in earlier periods such direct personal interaction with a deity was not believed possible, or at least was less likely to be expressed in writing. They are known mainly from inscriptions on statues and stelae left in sacred sites as votive offerings.|$|E
