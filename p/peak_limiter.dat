BACKGROUND CONTEXT In this work we present a method to achieve loudness enhancement of an audio mixture by using relative po-larities in a multi-track context in order to reduce crest factor 1. To our knowledge, this is a novel perspective, 1 It is widely accepted that loudness perception correlates with a signal’s root mean square (RMS) value, while peak value has little bearing. This means that a signal with a lower peak-to-RMS level (usu-ally termed crest factor) will be louder than a counterpart with a larger but there are several approaches that address polarity in a multi-track context (but not for loudness optimization) and many works that focus on crest factor minimization, normally to enhance loudness (but do so based on mixed signals, rather than multi-track content). In this section we will briefly review these past approaches. One should note that the use of polarity during the mix-value, if peak values are made equal...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{limiters}} transmit low-level radiation while blocking electromagnetic pulses with excessively {{high energy}} (energy limiters) or with excessively high <b>peak</b> intensity (power <b>limiters).</b> A typical optical limiter absorbs {{most of the}} high-level radiation which can cause its destruction via overheating. Here we introduce the novel concept of a reflective energy limiter which blocks electromagnetic pulses with excessively high total energy by reflecting them back to space, rather than absorbing them. The idea {{is to use a}} defect layer with temperature dependent loss tangent embedded in a low-loss photonic structure. The low energy pulses with central frequency close to that of the localized defect mode will pass through. But if the cumulative energy carried by the pulse exceeds certain level, the entire photonic structure reflects the incident light (and does not absorb it!) for a broad frequency window. The underlying physical mechanism is based on self-regulated impedance mismatch which increases dramatically with the cumulative energy carried by the pulse.

40|$|The {{compatibility}} of ICRF (ion cyclotron {{range of}} frequencies) antenna operation with high-Z plasma facing components is assessed in ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) with its tungsten (W) first wall. The mechanism of ICRF-related W sputtering was studied by various diagnostics including the local spectroscopic measurements of W sputtering yield Y(W) on antenna limiters. Modification of one antenna with triangular shields, which cover the locations where long magnetic field lines pass {{only one out}} of two (0 pi) -phased antenna straps, did not influence the locally measured Y(W) values markedly. In the experiments with antennas powered individually, poloidal profiles of Y(W) on limiters of powered antennas show high Y(W) close to the equatorial plane and at {{the very edge of the}} antenna top. The Y(W) -profile on an unpowered antenna <b>limiter</b> <b>peaks</b> at the location projecting to the top of the powered antenna. An interpretation of the Y(W) measurements is presented, assuming a direct link between the W sputtering and the sheath driving RF voltages deduced from parallel electric near-field (E(parallel to)) calculations and this suggests a strong E(parallel to) at the antenna limiters. However, uncertainties are too large to describe the Y(W) poloidal profiles. In order to reduce ICRF-related rise in W concentration C(W), an operational approach and an approach based on calculations of parallel electric fields with new antenna designs are considered. In the operation, a noticeable reduction in Y(W) and C(W) in the plasma during ICRF operation with W wall can be achieved by (a) increasing plasma-antenna clearance; (b) strong gas puffing; (c) decreasing the intrinsic light impurity content (mainly oxygen and carbon in AUG). In calculations, which take into account a realistic antenna geometry, the high E(parallel to) fields at the antenna limiters are reduced in several ways: (a) by extending the antenna box and the surrounding structures parallel to the magnetic field; (b) by increasing the average strap-box distance, e. g. by increasing the number of toroidally distributed straps; (c) by a better balance of (0 pi) -phased contributions to RF image currents...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Automatic {{locomotive}} signaling {{of continuous}} type with a numeric coding (ALSN) has several disadvantages: {{a small number}} of signal indications, low noise stability, high inertia and low functional flexibility. Search for new and more advanced methods of signal processing for automatic locomotive signaling, synthesis of the noise proof digital locomotive receiver are essential. Methodology. The proposed algorithm of detection and identification locomotive signaling codes is based on the definition of mutual correlations of received oscillation and reference signals. For selecting threshold levels of decision element the following criterion has been formulated: the locomotive receiver should maximum set the correct solution for a given probability of dangerous errors. Findings. It has been found that the random nature of the ALSN signal amplitude does not affect the detection algorithm. However, the distribution law and numeric characteristics of signal amplitude affect the probability of errors, and should be considered when selecting a threshold levels According to obtained algorithm of detection and identification ALSN signals the digital locomotive receiver has been synthesized.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} {{digital signal processing}} for actively controlled multi-way loudspeakers. In addition to examining AD- and DA-conversion principles and methods to increase their dynamic range, the main focus is targeted on filter technology. IIR filters are only used as a fully parametric equaliser bank that precedes the main crossover-and linearisation FIR-filter section. To obtain satisfactory resolution in the lower frequency bands with FIR filters, a downsampling scheme is used. The resulting process delay can be reduced by using minimum-phase low-pass filters in the down- and upsampling stages. Regarding the resulting frequency- and impulse responses of the equalised loudspeakers, FIR filters can give considerably better results compared to IIR filters {{and are able to}} equalise frequency responses to almost perfect performance with regard to amplitude and phase. However, compared with elaborate analogue solutions, these improvements do not lead to a considerable enhancement of perceived audio quality, at least if directivity and the influence of room acoustics are not considered. Efficient protection against overloading is an indispensable task in the area of large-scale sound reinforcement and also very useful in home hi-fi applications to avoid permanent damage to loudspeakers. The non-linear signal treatment needed to realise the appropriate limiter stages is discussed. A look-ahead <b>peak</b> <b>limiter</b> with zero overshoot and very low distortion is presented, along with a two staged thermo limiter to protect voice coils from overheating. The applied measurement technology for evaluating linear and time-invariant systems is presented by a brief overview of different methods, old and new. Practical aspects are also taken into account, such as weak non-linearities always present in loudspeaker measurements as well as polar response. The generation of efficient FIR bandpass filters featuring high stop-band attenuation along with very good equalisation properties in the pass-band is presented in detail. Additionally, various pre-processing tools to deviate deliberately from flat on-axis response are explained. Listening tests were conducted to further investigate why different loudspeakers still sound different, even when all equalised to the same on-axis frequency responses. It is shown that these speakers still produce quite different ear signals (as may be demonstrated by dummy head measurements), probably caused by different radiation properties and presumably also by different wave front patterns. Once different loudspeakers are equalised to produce the same in-ear frequency response, they become virtually indistinguishable. Hence, phase errors and non-linear distortion seem to have only negligible effect on the perceived differences between loudspeakers...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} amongst azimuthal flow, radial particle {{transport and}} turbulence on the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) are explored {{through the use}} of biasable limiters which continuously modify the rotation of the plasma column. Four quarter annulus plates serve as an iris-like boundary between the cathode source and the main plasma chamber. Application of a voltage to the plates using a capacitor bank drives cross-field current which rotates the plasma azimuthally in the electron diamagnetic direction (EDD). With the limiters inserted, a spontaneous rotation in the ion diamagnetic direction is observed; thus, increasing biasing tends to first slow rotation, null it out, then reverse it. This experiment builds on previous LAPD biasing experiments which used the chamber wall as the biasing electrode rather than inserted limiter plates. The use of inserted limiter biasing rather than chamber wall biasing allows for better cross-field current penetration between the plasma source and the electrodes which in turn allow for a finer variation of applied torque on the plasma. The modification of plasma parameter profiles, turbulent characteristics, and radial transport are tracked through these varying flow states. Azimuthal flow radial profiles are peaked at the limiter edge. Consequently, the variation in flow states also results in variation of sheared flow. Improved radial particle confinement is observed in states with sheared flow regardless of the direction of rotation. This improvement is indicated by both steepened density profiles and decreased radial particle flux. Conversely, a confinement degradation is seen in the minimum sheared flow state. Comparison of density fluctuation power and crossphase between density and radial velocity fluctuations show that both quantities are suppressed by sheared flow, but that the density fluctuation suppression is dominant and contributes most to the decrease in radial particle flux. Also, some observed changes to density and flux profiles suggest disagreement with a purely local model of transport including the formation of a hollow density profile at state of high flow (high bias) and regions where the direction of measured flux is opposite to that predicted by the direction of density gradient. Changes in flux and density gradient with bias are correlated but {{in a way that is}} inconsistent with a Fick's Law like model. Changes in turbulent spectra and features are observed with modification of the rotation state. Log-linear spectra with rotation in either azimuthal direction tends to exhibit a linear slope for power versus frequency and versus wavenumber, while spectra curves in the null flow case have an upward concave shape. Time traces corresponding to these spectra indicate a clear presence of Lorentzian structures in flow states but not in the null flow state. Spectral density histograms, showing the distribution of density fluctuation power in both frequency and wavenumber space, indicate that the modes tend to propagate azimuthally in the same direction as the flow. This suggests a large contribution of rotational interchange instability to the plasma turbulence. Regions with significant flow exhibit spectral density distributions which follow narrow curves in frequency and wavenumber space, much like a dispersion relation line. Regions without flow (either the null flow state or the plasma core) have broader, more diffuse distributions. A pair of coherent modes develop with rotation in the EDD direction. The mode fluctuation power <b>peaks</b> at the <b>limiter</b> edge; since maximum flow is observed at the limiter edge, the modes are most likely flow driven. Comparison with a linear Braginskii-fluid model eigenfunction solver supports this conclusion. The lower frequency mode [...] -first observed at about 1 - 2 kHz [...] -is identified as a pure interchange mode while the higher frequency mode [...] -first observed at about 5 - 6 kHz [...] -is determined to be a coupled drift-wave interchange mode.
