30|$|Through {{the above}} analysis, the deep {{potential}} well is only formed {{at the top}} of channel under <b>Gate</b> <b>2</b> after writing “ 1 ”. Therefore, in the channel region under <b>Gate</b> <b>2,</b> the energy band {{at the top of}} channel is much higher than that at the bottom of channel. This demonstrates {{that there will be a}} barrier at the top of channel under <b>Gate</b> <b>2</b> during the reading “ 1 ”. The inset of Fig. 8 b plots the energy band at both the top and bottom of the channel after reading “ 1 ”. It can be clearly found that a higher channel barrier exists between Gate 1 and <b>Gate</b> <b>2</b> at the top of channel, but this barrier does not exist at the bottom of channel. Therefore, the conduction path is at the top of channel under Gate 1 and the bottom of channel under <b>Gate</b> <b>2</b> during the reading “ 1 ”, which can be clearly demonstrated by the current density in Fig. 8.|$|R

30|$|Subsequently, the {{optimization}} {{of reading}} operation is also investigated. The reading operation strongly {{relies on the}} BTBT between the P+ source and channel. During the reading “ 1 ”, Gate 1 mainly promotes the BTBT at the source side, whereas <b>Gate</b> <b>2</b> with the high voltage lowers the energy barrier which resists the flowing of electrons from the channel to drain. But during the reading “ 0 ”, {{it is necessary that}} <b>Gate</b> <b>2</b> with the small voltage be able to prevent electrons flowing from the channel to drain. Therefore, the optimization of both the Gate 1 and <b>Gate</b> <b>2</b> voltages is very important for the reading operation.|$|R

30|$|The {{detailed}} optimization guideline {{of programming}} {{condition for the}} DG-TFET DRAM is proposed in this paper using the Silvaco-Atlas simulation tool. During the writing “ 1 ”, <b>Gate</b> <b>2</b> with the negative voltage (− 1.3  V) creates a potential well, and the BTBT between the channel and drain makes the holes be accumulated in this potential well. During the writing “ 0 ”, <b>Gate</b> <b>2</b> with the positive voltage (1.3  V) makes holes escape form the potential well. For the holding operation, the small negative voltage (− 0.2  V) is applied at <b>Gate</b> <b>2</b> to retain the holes, which can improve the reading “ 1 ” current. After holding “ 0 ”, the barrier of channel under <b>Gate</b> <b>2</b> can resist electrons flowing towards the drain side to reduce reading “ 0 ” current. For the optimization of reading operation, the larger Gate 1 voltage (1  V) is mainly used to enhance BTBT at the source side during reading “ 1 ”, whereas an appropriate <b>Gate</b> <b>2</b> voltage (0.8  V) is used to resist electrons flowing towards drain during reading “ 0 ”. The optimized programming condition makes the DG-TFET DRAM obtain the higher current ratio (107) of reading “ 1 ” to reading “ 0 ” and retention time of more than 2  s. And the extremely low reading “ 0 ” current is helpful for the reduction of power consumption.|$|R

30|$|The {{performance}} of TFET DRAM, especially {{the current ratio}} of reading “ 1 ” to reading “ 0 ”, has a great dependence on programming condition. <b>Gate</b> <b>2</b> mainly influences the BTBT during the writing operation, which dominates the storage region of charges and potential well under <b>Gate</b> <b>2.</b> <b>Gate</b> 1 governs the BTBT during the reading operation, which mainly influences the reading “ 1 ” current. The proper biases of both Gate 1 and <b>Gate</b> <b>2</b> can make DGTFET DRAM obtain the higher current ratio. There is a little literature studying the influence of programing condition on reading current. In this paper, a detailed programming optimization guideline is proposed, including writing, holding, and reading operations. By applying the optimized programming condition, the DG-TFET DRAM obtains the optimum performance—the reading current ratio of up to 107 and the RT of more than 2  s. And applying the optimized programming voltage, the reading “ 0 ” current is much lower than that reported in reference [16, 18], which is helpful for {{the reduction of the}} power consumption.|$|R
