He hit 45 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shots {{from the floor and}} 78.4 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> free throws. Middleton scored in excess of 10 points in 27 games and {{led the team}} in scoring 16 times. He scored a career-high 31 points in a 71-62 overtime victory over Arkansas, including 11 of the team's las 12 points in regulation.

On January 15, 2011, Middleton tallied 28 points, including 11 in overtime, to defeat Missouri 91-89.|$|E
5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the spacecraft and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} to position the capsule using half a <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but made no attempt to move towards it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, he turned his attention to testing manual control of the spacecraft, which he found sloppy compared to the fly-by-wire system.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{hoped to}} attend Yale's law school {{beginning}} in 1935. Yale officials at first denied his {{admission to the}} law school because of his full-time coaching responsibilities. He spent the summer of 1937 {{as a student at}} the University of Michigan Law School and was eventually admitted in the spring of 1938 to Yale Law School. Ford earned his LL.B. degree in 1941 (later amended to Juris Doctor), graduating in the top 25 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> class.|$|E
50|$|Socialist {{candidate}} Eugene Debs took 8.57 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the vote, <b>his</b> {{highest percentage}} nationally.|$|R
50|$|McDuffie won {{the special}} election, {{receiving}} 43 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the votes. <b>His</b> term ended 2014.|$|R
50|$|Boykin {{attended}} West Mesquite High School in Mesquite, Texas, {{where he}} was a letterman in football and track. In football, Boykin rushed for 1,380 yards with 24 scores on the ground and completed 53.2 <b>percent</b> (116-of-218) <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pass attempts for 1,666 yards and 10 touchdowns through the air as a junior.

5|$|Gautham is a {{schizophrenic}} Indian rock {{musician who}} is missing 25 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grey matter. He hallucinates a mysterious person {{he believes is}} one of the three murderers of his parents. As a child, Gautham was convinced that he was an orphan and assumes that his parents are dead; he does not remember their names or what they looked like.|$|E
5|$|Hotze's force took {{relatively}} high casualties—1,000men killed, wounded or missing (12.5 <b>percent)</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> entire force of 8,000—although his losses were comparable to Ney's 800 killed wounded or missing, from his 7,000-man force (11.5 percent). More importantly, though, Hotze succeeded {{not only in}} pushing the French back from Winterthur, but also in uniting his force with Nauendorf's and Charles'. The unified Austrian force completed the semicircle around Masséna's positions at Zürich.|$|E
5|$|Kafka {{finished}} {{none of his}} full-length {{novels and}} burned around 90 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work, much of it during the period he lived in Berlin with Diamant, who helped him burn the drafts. In his early years as a writer, he was influenced by von Kleist, whose work he described {{in a letter to}} Bauer as frightening, and whom he considered closer than his own family.|$|E
5000|$|If an {{employer}} requires his employee {{to work on}} his scheduled rest day, he shall be paid an additional compensation of at least thirty <b>percent</b> (30%) <b>of</b> <b>his</b> regular wage.|$|R
25|$|Including his two {{championship}} seasons, he {{has finished}} in the top 10 in the year-end standings 17 times, and his top-five and top-ten totals approach 25 percent and 50 <b>percent,</b> respectively, <b>of</b> <b>his</b> total races.|$|R
25|$|Despite these problems, Chavous won the Democratic primary on September 12. He {{garnered}} 53 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the vote. <b>His</b> closest challenger was Rev. Robert B. Hunter, {{who received}} 33 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the vote.|$|R
5|$|Rockefeller's {{charitable}} giving began {{with his first}} job as a clerk at age 16, when he gave six <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> earnings to charity, as recorded in his personal ledger. By {{the time he was}} twenty, his charity exceeded ten <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> income. Much of his giving was church-related. His church was later affiliated with the Northern Baptist Convention, which formed from American Baptists in the North with ties to their historic missions to establish schools and colleges for freedmen in the South after the American Civil War. Rockefeller attended Baptist churches every Sunday; when traveling he would often attend services at African-American Baptist congregations, leaving a substantial donation. As Rockefeller's wealth grew, so did his giving, primarily to educational and public health causes, but also for basic science and the arts. He was advised primarily by Frederick Taylor Gates after 1891, and, after 1897, also by his son.|$|E
5|$|Takanohana {{was largely}} a yotsu-sumo wrestler, favouring {{techniques}} which involved grabbing his opponent's mawashi or belt. His preferred grip was migi-yotsu (right hand inside, left hand outside his opponent). His most common winning kimarite by far was yori-kiri, a simple force out, which accounted for 52 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> victories. He also regularly employed uwatenage, or overarm throw, {{and this was the}} technique he used to defeat Asashōryū in the second of their two meetings, in September 2002.|$|E
5|$|Cito Gaston {{has both}} managed {{and won the}} most games of any Blue Jays manager, with 1,731 games and 894 wins. He is {{followed}} by John Gibbons in both categories, with 1,258 games and 644 wins, who surpassed Bobby Cox's marks during his second stint as manager. Gaston is the only Blue Jays manager to win a World Series in 1992 and 1993, the fourth African-American manager in MLB history, {{and was the first}} African-American manager to win a World Series. Cox is the only Blue Jays manager to be awarded the AL Manager of the Year Award in 1985. Mel Queen has the best winning percentage by winning 80 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> 5 games coached.|$|E
25|$|Kohner {{sold the}} movie rights to Columbia Pictures (through the William Morris Agency) for $50,000, then giving five <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> this to <b>his</b> {{daughter}} Kathy.|$|R

5|$|Clemson's {{offense was}} led by quarterback Woodrow Dantzler, who {{finished}} the regular season having completed 58 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> passes for 1,691 yards, 10 touchdowns, and six interceptions. He also ran the ball extremely successfully, gaining 947 yards and 13 touchdowns on the ground. In the running game, Dantzler had the second-most yards on the team.

He caught 27 passes for 288 {{yards and four touchdowns}} during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Downey {{was able}} to return to the big screen only after Mel Gibson, who had been a close friend to Downey since both had co-starred in Air America, paid Downey's {{insurance}} bond for the 2003 film The Singing Detective. Gibson's gamble paved the way for Downey's comeback and Downey returned to mainstream films in the mid-2000s with Gothika, for which producer Joel Silver withheld 40 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> salary until after production wrapped as insurance against his addictive behavior. Similar clauses have become standard in his contracts since then. Silver, who was getting closer to Downey as he dated his assistant Susan Levin, also got the actor the leading role in the comedy thriller Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, the directorial debut of screenwriter Shane Black.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008 Raquel Islas, {{a female}} worker whose arms were burnt, sued Savannah company Stokes Contracting, {{who had a}} {{contract}} to clean the factory. In April 2008 the widow of Shelathia Harvey also sued Stokes, as well as Savannah Foods. It was a wholly owned subsidiary after Imperial bought them out and the factory was still owned in its name. In August, 2008 Malcolm Frazier succumbed to his injuries, bringing {{the total number of}} deaths to fourteen. Frazier, who suffered burns over 85% <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body, died at the Joseph M. Still Burn Center, where he had remained since the explosion.|$|E
50|$|Cannon was {{defeated}} in the 2011 election by NDP challenger Mathieu Ravignat, winning only 29.5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the vote. <b>His</b> place as Minister of Foreign Affairs was taken by John Baird.|$|R
50|$|After {{being paid}} $400,000 US plus ten <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> profits for <b>his</b> Ryan's Daughter screenplay, Bolt became {{for a time}} the highest-paid screenwriter in Hollywood (with only William Goldman in serious competition).|$|R
50|$|Official polls {{taken at}} the time {{consistently}} revealed the French public to be against the punishment brought upon Gaillot. One CSA survey showed that total <b>of</b> 64 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the public were against the firing of Jacques Gaillot as bishop of Évreux, with only 11 <b>percent</b> approving <b>of</b> <b>his</b> firing and a remaining 25 percent being undecided. Some later polls showed that support for Gaillot might even have been as high as 75 percent.|$|R
5|$|In five hours, Frederick lost 9,400 of the 30,000 men {{he brought}} into the battle, more than 30 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army, {{including}} five generals, 101 guns, and nearly all the tents. Frederick required his generals {{to set an example}} of courage and leadership: they led from the front. The same rate of attrition applied throughout the officer corps, which lost half of its strength in the first three campaigns of the war. In addition to human losses, they lost valuable horses and draft animals, 70 munitions wagons, and, a blow to morale, 28 flags, and two standards. On the positive side, Retzow's corps of about 6,000 men, which had not arrived in time to participate in the fighting, remained intact; Frederick had pulled his troops together for an orderly retreat; and the King retained the confidence of his soldiers.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{attended}} Mitchell High School, {{where he}} was a solid but unspectacular member of the track team. A turning point came when his tenth-grade English teacher recommended him to the debate team, where he became quite active. His high-school debate coach, a history teacher who capitalized on McGovern's interest in that subject, proved to be a great influence in his life, and McGovern spent many hours honing his meticulous, if colorless, forensic style. McGovern and his debating partner won events in his area and gained renown in a state where debating was passionately followed by the general public. Debate changed McGovern's life, giving him a chance to explore ideas to their logical end, broadening his perspective, and instilling a sense of personal and social confidence. He graduated in 1940 in the top ten <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> class.|$|E
5|$|Mitt Romney {{wanted to}} pursue a {{business}} career, but his father advised him that a law degree would be valuable to his career even if he never practiced law. As a result, he enrolled in the recently created four-year joint Juris Doctor/Master of Business Administration program coordinated between Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School. He readily adapted to the business school's pragmatic, data-driven case study method of teaching. Living in a Belmont, Massachusetts house with Ann and their two children, his social experience differed from most of his classmates'. He was nonideological and did not involve himself in the political issues of the day. He graduated in 1975 cum laude from the law school, in the top third of that class, and was named a Baker Scholar for graduating {{in the top five}} <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> business school class.|$|E
50|$|If {{the holiday}} {{falls under the}} employee's rest day, and he decides to work, his wage for the first eight (8) hours <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work will be doubled. If he works for more than eight (8) hours, then thirty <b>percent</b> (30%) <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hourly rate {{will be added to}} his wage for that day.|$|R
50|$|McCracken scored 32.3 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> {{the points}} <b>his</b> three Hoosier teams scored. He led the Big Ten Conference with a 12.3 average {{his senior year}} and {{graduated}} as the league's career scoring record holder.|$|R
5000|$|Carter's post-Presidency {{activities}} have been favorably received. The Independent wrote, [...] "Carter {{is widely considered}} a better man than he was a president." [...] His presidential approval rating was just 31 percent immediately before the 1980 election, but 64 <b>percent</b> approved <b>of</b> <b>his</b> performance as president in a 2009 poll.|$|R
5|$|On April 16, 2007, he {{batted in}} 6 {{runs on the}} way to a 12–5 victory over the Kansas City Royals. On June 12 he caught Justin Verlander's first no-hitter, the second no-hitter he caught in his career. In 2007, Rodríguez walked in only 1.8 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> plate appearances, the lowest {{percentage}} in the major leagues. On October 9, the Tigers announced that they were picking up the fifth-year, 13-million-dollar option on Rodríguez's contract, keeping him on the Tigers team through at least the 2008 season. The team could have bought out the option for three million dollars and allowed him to become a free agent.|$|E
5|$|Playing in {{the final}} year of his contract, Glencross set {{personal}} highs of 24goals and 43points in 2010–11. While the Flames received offers from other teams for Glencross at the trade deadline, the team chose to hold on to him though they risked losing him as an unrestricted free agent following the season. Glencross chose to remain in Calgary, agreeing to a four-year, $10.2million contract with the Flames on May 17, 2011. Glencross felt that he could have earned a bigger contract on the open market, but chose to take less money to remain in Calgary. With 26 goals in 2011–12, Glencross finished second on the team to Jarome Iginla's 32. He was the league's most efficient scorer, scoring on 23.6 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shots on net.|$|E
5|$|Stanford's {{offense was}} {{commanded}} by redshirt sophomore quarterback Andrew Luck, who completed 70 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pass attempts, gaining 3,051yards, 28touchdowns, and 7interceptions. The touchdown mark was a Stanford single-season record. He also gained 438yards running the ball, setting a Stanford record for rushing by a quarterback, and his combined rushing and passing total {{set a record}} at Stanford for total offense. On December 13, Luck {{finished second in the}} voting for the Heisman Trophy, the annual award given to the best player in college football that season. NCAA rules allow a player three years removed from high school to enter the NFL Draft, and even though he was only a sophomore in 2010, he met the three-year standard {{at the conclusion of the}} season. Before the Orange Bowl, media and fans speculated as to Luck's likely choice.|$|E
50|$|Péladeau was {{narrowly}} elected with 37 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the vote. <b>His</b> {{first day}} at the National Assembly was on 26 May 2014, eight days after a bike accident in the Eastern Townships left him with four fractures.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, Galbraith {{decided to}} run in the 6th District again. Incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Ernie Fletcher won {{re-election}} with 72 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the vote.
