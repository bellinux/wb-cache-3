5|$|Beatrice was the shyest {{of all of}} Queen Victoria's children. However, {{because she}} {{accompanied}} Queen Victoria almost wherever she went, she became among the best known. Despite her shyness, she was an able actress and dancer {{as well as a}} keen artist and photographer. She was devoted to her children and was concerned when they misbehaved at school. To those who enjoyed her friendship, she was loyal and had a sense of humour, and as a public figure she was driven by a strong sense of duty. She was Patron of the Isle of Wight Branch of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1920 until her death. Music, a <b>passion</b> <b>that</b> was shared by her mother and the Prince Consort, was something in which Beatrice excelled, and she played the piano to professional standards. Like her mother, she was a devout Christian, fascinated by theology until her death. With her calm temperament and personal warmth, the princess won wide approval.|$|E
25|$|In Celtic mythology, {{no direct}} {{representation}} of {{gay or lesbian}} relationships exist. Ancient Greek and Roman commentators attribute sexual activity between males, including pederasty, to pre-Christian Celtic tribes. However, Peter Chicheri argues in Celtic sexuality: power, paradigms, and <b>passion</b> <b>that</b> homosexual affection was severely punished in Celtic culture due to influence from Christianity, and suggests that any non-procreative sexual experience was subsequently expunged from mythic tales.|$|E
25|$|At the rehearsal, Anna Del Serre declaimed {{these lines}} with such <b>passion,</b> <b>that</b> Ronzi Di Begnis took {{them as a}} {{personal}} insult and rushed at Del Serre, pulling her hair, punching her, biting her and hitting her {{on her face and}} breast. Del Serre returned in kind, but the soprano got the better of her rival, and Del Serre was carried fainting from the theatre.|$|E

25|$|Jean-Pierre Rives {{was born}} on 31 December 1952 in Saint-Simon, a suburb of Toulouse, in the Haute-Garonne, Occitan departement of southwestern France. He grew up with his brother Philippe in the family of Jo and Lydia Rives. Jean-Pierre started drawing and {{painting}} in primary school – a <b>passion</b> <b>that</b> would stay with him throughout his whole life. His father was a pilot and an avid tennis player, and he encouraged his son, who excelled in athletics at early age, to pursue tennis, but it was rugby that would become Jean-Pierre Rives' ultimate choice.|$|E
25|$|The Brazil women's {{national}} team {{is a successful}} women's football team, though not as successful as the men's counterpart. It was runner-up in the FIFA Women's World Cup of 2007, and a Silver Medal at the Olympic games in 2004 and 2008. In comparison, Argentina {{does not have a}} professional (or even semi-professional) women's football league; the members of the Argentina women's national football team are all amateur players despite their clubs often being affiliated with prominent men's professional clubs. Although the two teams usually have to battle for the top qualification spots for CONMEBOL when the World Cup qualification comes around, this rivalry does not provide the <b>passion</b> <b>that</b> men's matches encounter yet.|$|E
25|$|Mary, well-educated and unusually curious in an {{era when}} a woman's primary focus is keeping house and {{attending}} to the needs of her family, surprises Charles with the depth of her interest and ability and becomes his assistant. He is delighted to find a kindred spirit in his isolation, and the admiration she feels soon turns to <b>passion</b> <b>that</b> he reciprocates. While secretly observing Passover in her room, she spills salt water onto one of Charles' prints, accidentally discovering a technique that preserves the image. The next morning she rushes to the laboratory to tell Charles, and their excitement spills over into making love for the first time. But he becomes increasingly consumed with the race to publish their new process, while she is captivated by the beauty of the photographs they create.|$|E

25|$|Bhumibol came to Thailand in 1928, {{after his}} father {{obtained}} a certificate from Harvard. His father died of kidney failure in September 1929, when Bhumibol was {{less than two years}} old. He briefly attended Mater Dei school in Bangkok, but in 1933 his mother took her family to Switzerland, where he continued his education at the École nouvelle de la Suisse romande in Lausanne. In 1934 Bhumibol was given his first camera, which ignited his lifelong enthusiasm for photography. When Bhumibol's childless uncle Prajadhipok abdicated in 1935, his nine-year-old brother Ananda became the new King Rama VIII. However, the family remained in Switzerland and the affairs of the head of state were conducted by a regency council. They returned to Thailand for only two months in 1938. In 1942, Bhumibol became a jazz enthusiast, and started to play the saxophone, a <b>passion</b> <b>that</b> he kept throughout his life. He received the baccalauréat des lettres (high-school diploma with a major in French literature, Latin, and Greek) from the Gymnase Classique Cantonal of Lausanne, and by 1945 had begun studying sciences at the University of Lausanne, when World War II ended and the family was able to return to Thailand.|$|E
25|$|Isabella {{first came}} to Genoa City to {{distract}} Paul Williams {{as a favor to}} Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc), who wanted to break up Paul and his wife, Christine. Isabella approached Paul at his office with a case against her husband, which he took. Paul gave Isabella shelter, and the two were drawn to each other. Upon the ending of the case, Isabella's past as a call girl came out, but Paul forgave Isabella for lying, and they became even closer. Isabella was keen on leaving the city after the case was over, but both Michael and Paul had their reasons for keeping her in town. Isabella was surprised to learn that she was pregnant with Paul's child. Paul's marriage took another hit when Christine returned home to find him passionately kissing Isabella. However, Isabella didn't want Paul, and she decided to tell Michael that she was carrying his child after a night of <b>passion</b> <b>that</b> they had. Michael reluctantly agreed to pay for her expenses and went along with all of her demands, while Paul became closer to his ex-wife, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). Paul found out that he was the father of Isabella's child and decided to raise his son with her. Both Michael and Mary Williams (Carolyn Conwell), Paul's mother, were not happy to learn the truth. Mary did her best to break up the couple, and Paul eventually realized that he couldn't be one happy family with Isabella and their baby.|$|E

50|$|What {{human nature}} did entail, {{according}} to Rousseau {{and the other}} modernists of the 17th and 18th centuries, were animal-like <b>passions</b> <b>that</b> led humanity to develop language and reasoning, and more complex communities (or communities of any kind, according to Rousseau).|$|R

Dr. Luke also explained that Hilary Duff's management {{was interested in the}} song but rejected it because Duff could not reach the song's higher notes. It was Clive Davis who convinced Martin and Dr. Luke to give the song to Clarkson, even though they were initially reluctant. Davis said, [...] "Max was looking to move on from what he had done with Backstreet Boys, and I really spent time convincing them that an 'American Idol' winner could bring all the feeling and <b>passion</b> <b>that</b> was required to the song." ...|$|E

[...] During an interview with People, she explained that she intended for the track to reach [...] "every young girl out there who’s gonna go through everything I went through, and more" [...] as well as older women. Connecting the lyrics with her own childhood, Fantasia said, [...] "I was very insecure growing up, and even though I'm not that girl anymore, I think that the <b>passion,</b> <b>that</b> not feeling pretty and being insecure is where my soul came from. And from early childhood, I let it free onstage." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1982, Madonna {{was working}} with {{producer}} Reggie Lucas on her debut album. She had already composed three songs, when Lucas brought {{one of his own}} compositions to the project, calling it [...] "Borderline". However, after recording the song, Madonna was unhappy with the final version. According to her, Lucas used too many instruments and did not consider her ideas for the song. This led to a dispute between the two. After finishing the album, Lucas left the project without altering the songs to Madonna's specifications. Hence, Madonna brought her then boyfriend John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez to remix [...] "Borderline" [...] and two other recorded tracks. On hearing the final version, Seymour Stein, head of Sire Records declared, [...] "I dared to believe {{this was going to be}} huge beyond belief, the biggest thing I'd ever had, after I heard 'Borderline'... The <b>passion</b> <b>that</b> she put into that song, I thought, there's no stopping this girl." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said the songs produced by David Foster are too predictable {{due to their}} [...] "slick commercial appeal". However, Erlewine noted that Braxton [...] "manages to infuse the songs with life and <b>passion</b> <b>that</b> elevates them beyond their generic confines" [...] due to her vocal ability. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered the track [...] "a tearjerker so grandiose and yet so intrinsically, assuredly hit-bound, it's the kind of mass-appeal grabber that's probably already sent a jealous Diana Ross diving for a comfort gallon of Häagen-Dazs." [...] Tucker also named it the worst track on Secrets, and further stated: [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] is [...] "one of those the-verses-exist-only-for-the-swelling-chorus showstoppers that allude to emotions without ever actually embodying them. Braxton does her darnedest to plug some life into the song, to no avail". J.D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun described [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] as [...] "overblown".|$|E

500|$|Another great <b>passion</b> <b>that</b> is {{depicted}} in Traherne's work is his love {{of nature and the}} natural world, frequently displayed in a very Romantic treatment of nature that has been described as characteristically pantheist or panentheist. While Traherne credits a divine source for its creation, his praise of nature seems nothing less than what one would expect to find in Thoreau. Many scholars consider Traherne a writer of the sublime, and in his writing he seems to have tried to reclaim the lost appreciation for the natural world, as well as paying tribute to what he knew of in nature that was more powerful than he was. In this sense Traherne seems to have anticipated the Romantic movement more than 130 years before it actually occurred. There is frequent discussion of man's almost symbiotic relationship with nature, as well as frequent use of [...] "literal setting", that is, an attempt to faithfully reproduce a sense experience from a given moment, a technique later used frequently by William Wordsworth.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} Tennyson's other poems, {{there is a}} strong {{connection}} between the character Mariana and Tennyson's other female characters. Both [...] "Mariana" [...] and [...] "Oriana" [...] have characters that experience a mental imprisonment, which are revealed in the poetic refrains. However, Oriana is able to have control over her own story when she serves as narrator of it while Mariana is denied control by Tennyson's use of a third-person narrative structure. The difference is further compounded by Oriana's imprisonment coming from her own memories while Mariana's is the external results of her lover having not returned. The character Fatima of Fatima is connected to [...] "Mariana" [...] simply because she is a reversal of Mariana's character: Fatima, like Mariana, waits for her lover but suffers from an intense <b>passion</b> <b>that</b> causes her to lose control over her mind while also being able to experience the world around her. The character Oenone of [...] "Oenone" [...] is a combination of aspects from both Mariana's and Fatima's characters. In the revised version Mariana in the South, the second Mariana is similar to the Lady of Shalott in that they both live in a world between fantasy and reality.|$|E
500|$|Jet {{magazine}} reported [...] "Janet's innovative stage performances {{during her}} world tours have won her {{a reputation as}} a world-class performer." [...] Chris Willman of Los Angeles Times stated the [...] "enthralling" [...] choreography of Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour [...] "represents the pinnacle of what can be done in the popping 'n' locking style—a rapid-fire mixture of rigidly jerky and gracefully fluid movements." [...] When Jackson was asked [...] "do you understand it when people talk about [...] in terms of Broadway?", she responded, [...] "I'm crazy about Broadway ... That's what I grew up on." [...] Her [...] "Number Ones: Up Close and Personal" [...] tour deviated from the full-scale theatrics found in her previous concert arena settings in favor of smaller venues. Critics noted being scaled down did not affect the impact of her showmanship, and in some cases, enhanced it. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune wrote, [...] "In past tours, Jackson's thin voice was often swallowed up by the sheer size of her production... In the more scaled-down setting, Jackson brought a warmth and a <b>passion</b> <b>that</b> wasn't always evident in stadiums... the best Janet Jackson performance I've covered in 20-plus years." ...|$|E
