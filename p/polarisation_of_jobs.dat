40|$|Evidence {{from the}} ESRC Future of Work {{research}} programme suggests that an hourglass-shaped occupational structure is {{emerging in the}} UK, with the <b>polarisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> at {{top and bottom of}} the occupational hierarchy (Nolan, 2001). Despite the implicit suggestion that jobs in the middle appear to be disappearing, somewhat paradoxically, there are increasing reports of skill and recruitment problems across intermediate occupations (DfES, 2002; FSS, 2007; LSC, 2006). This paper argues that whilst the hourglass economy thesis, or a variation of it, best describes recent occupational transformations, it is limited both conceptually and empirically; more specifically, it neglects important dimensions of change within intermediate occupations...|$|E
30|$|Another {{observation}} is that job loss {{has been particularly}} high in certain occupations. Assuming that differences in earnings between occupations reflect differences in labour market skills, then this shift {{can be interpreted as}} implying that certain skill groups have been more affected during the crisis. Several studies on US data have reported that workers in middle-wage/middle-skill occupations have been disproportionately hit during the crisis, leading to a <b>polarisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> on the labour market (Autor 2010; Foote and Ryan 2015). Although accentuated during the crisis, this occupational polarisation is reported to have started much earlier (Autor 2010). Similar trends in occupational polarisation have been described for a number of European countries before the crisis (Goos et al. 2009) and are usually interpreted in the context of skill-bias technological change arguments. In the case of European countries, however, evidence for polarisation appears somewhat sensitive to the ordering and/or grouping of occupations considered (e.g. Fernandez-Macias 2012).|$|E
40|$|While {{the gender}} pay gap has been {{narrowing}} {{for women in}} full-time jobs the pay penalty for the 40 % of women who work part-time has risen, reflecting the growing <b>polarisation</b> <b>of</b> part-time <b>jobs</b> in low-wage occupations. A further dimension is that women often experience downgrading from higher-skill full-time into lower-skill part-time occupations. As women reorganise their working lives around the presence of children their reported hours and job satisfaction are highest in part-time work, but life-satisfaction is scarcely affected by hours of work.

40|$|To be in {{relative}} poverty {{is to be}} excluded from the normal activities and acceptable standard of living in one’s community. In order to determine whether poverty in Australia is due to involuntary or voluntary causes a detailed examination is undertaken {{of the causes of}} disadvantage and the groups on whom these causes are impacting. Poverty is defined as involuntary when it is caused by factors outside of individual control, or where choices are so limited that one cannot escape from poverty. Nationwide evidence and a case study of poverty in the Newcastle region suggest the following indicators of involuntary poverty: Structural unemployment, Excess <b>of</b> <b>job</b> seekers over <b>job</b> vacancies, <b>Polarisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> growth into high skilled and low-paid low-skilled work, Decline in social expenditure, Lack of access to affordable childcare services, Increased cost of further education, Mismatch of education with areas <b>of</b> <b>job</b> growth, Unequal access to the internet, Inadequate provision of public transport, Relatively low expenditure on health of low-income groups, Decline in bulk billing, Decline in availability of low cost housing, Below poverty line welfare payments, High effective marginal tax rates for welfare recipients entering paid employment. Secondary indicators produced by the above causes include the presence of cohorts of poverty and locations of disadvantage (postcodes of poverty). A statistical analysis of poverty in Newcastle shows that the variance in the log of odds of poverty between Newcastle’s suburbs is largely due to variations in cohorts of disadvantage and structural causes. This supports the hypothesis that the majority of poverty in Australia is involuntary. It is necessary that the government acknowledge that poverty is largely involuntary so that Australia can shift from a culture of blame to one of mutual responsibility. Government and community action is required to rectify the causes of involuntary poverty. This can be achieved through job creation schemes, sufficient compensation for the unemployed and other groups of disadvantage, adequate and affordable provision of infrastructure and services, such as public transport, childcare, health care, public housing and education. The result will be a more cohesive society with equal opportunity for all citizens and improved social and individual welfare...|$|R

40|$|Latest {{since the}} early eighties destandardisation of {{employment}} became a term of wide comprehension. Especially in Germany the once predictable employment biography would have been dissolving for an occupational career with phases of unemployment and many job changes.

By means of a longitudinal dataset {{on the basis of the}} German Socio-economic panel covering the years 1985 to 2000 this dissertation is showing that the destandardisation of work in West Germany is first beginning in the middle of the nineties.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} the gendered <b>polarisation</b> <b>of</b> work hours between {{mothers and fathers}} in Australia. Drawing on a large Australian sample of employee parents, we investigate the links between job quality and employment contract. Our focus is on mothers and fathers of young children - families facing high care demands - and investigate whether shorter and longer hour jobs carry the same contract and quality costs. Using a truncated measure <b>of</b> <b>job</b> quality, we find for both mothers and fathers that moderate full time hour jobs were the jobs with optimal quality and stable employment contracts. Poor job quality and casual contracts were common in very short hour jobs, usually worked by mothers. At {{the other end of}} the work hour spectrum, the very long hour jobs predominantly worked by fathers also showed a dip in job quality. Our study suggests that the gendered <b>polarisation</b> <b>of</b> hours in the Australian labour market, supported by a one-and-a-half earner family strategy, undermines parents&# 039;, particularly mothers&# 039;, access to good quality jobs. It also reinforces gender inequality by making it harder for fathers to fully engage in parenting and mothers to fully participate in employment and earn a decent income, with consequent hardship in later life...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} {{the findings of}} a multi-wavelength and polarimetric study of a number <b>of</b> rotation-powered pulsars. <b>Polarisation</b> studies <b>of</b> pulsars are just one example of obtaining insight into the geometry of their emission regions. Such measurements provide observational constraints on the various theoretical models of the pulsar emission mechanism. Hence, it is possible to limit these competing models and find the model that best matches observations. A comparison of the optical light curves to the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray ones is also important to locate diff erent emission regions in the neutron star magnetosphere. The phase-averaged optical linear <b>polarisation</b> <b>of</b> the Crab nebula and pulsar was measured using observations from the HST/ACS.

However, the <b>polarisation</b> <b>of</b> wages does not seem to be common in Spain, as there is no evidence that changes in pay followed the same pattern as changes in occupations.
