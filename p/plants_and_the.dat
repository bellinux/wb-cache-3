5|$|Several cultivars of P.atriplicifolia {{have been}} developed. They are {{primarily}} distinguished by {{the height of}} mature <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> depth of the leaf-margin incisions. Many of these cultivars, especially those with deeply incised leaves, may actually be hybrids of P.atriplicifolia and P.abrotanoides.

5|$|Aarhus has {{increasingly}} been investing in environmental planning and, {{in accordance with}} national policy, aims to be CO2 neutral and independent of fossil fuels for heating by 2030. The municipal power plants were adapted for this purpose in the 2010s. In 2015, the municipality took over three private straw-fired heating <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> year after, a new 77 MW {{combined heat and power}} biomass plant at Lisbjerg Power Station was completed while Studstrup Power Station finished a refit to move from coal to wood chips. In conjunction with the development of the Docklands district there are plans for a utility scale seawater heat pump which will take advantage of fluctuating electricity prices to supply the district heating system.|$|E

5|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil {{rhizosphere}} bacterium, can {{attach to}} plant cells and infect {{them with a}} callus-inducing Ti plasmid by horizontal gene transfer, causing a callus infection called crown gall disease.

Today, genetic modification of the Ti plasmid {{is one of the}} main techniques for introduction of transgenes to <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> creation of genetically modified crops.|$|E
5|$|Botanical {{gardens are}} still being built, such as the first botanical garden in Oman, which {{will be one of}} the largest gardens in the world. Once completed, it will house the first {{large-scale}} cloud forest in a huge glasshouse.

5|$|Not all co-evolved {{interactions}} between species involve conflict. Many cases of mutually beneficial interactions have evolved. For instance, an extreme cooperation exists between <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mycorrhizal fungi that grow on their roots and aid {{the plant in}} absorbing nutrients from the soil. This is a reciprocal relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis. Here, the fungi actually grow inside plant cells, allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts, while sending signals that suppress the plant immune system.|$|E

5|$|The {{grasshopper}} nematode (Mermis nigrescens) {{is a long}} slender worm that infects grasshoppers, {{living in}} the insect's hemocoel. Adult worms lay eggs on <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> host becomes infected when the foliage is eaten. Spinochordodes tellinii and Paragordius tricuspidatus are parasitic worms that infect grasshoppers and alter the behaviour of their hosts. When the worms are sufficiently developed, the grasshopper is persuaded to leap into a nearby body of water where it drowns, thus enabling the parasite {{to continue with the}} next stage of its life cycle, which takes place in water.|$|E

5|$|The oil-fired Turkey Point power {{stations}} were completed in 1967–68 and experienced immediate problems from {{the discharge of}} hot cooling water into Biscayne Bay, where the heat killed marine grasses. In 1964 FP announced plans for two 693 MW nuclear reactors at the site, which were expected to compound the cooling water problem. Because of the shallowness of Biscayne Bay, the {{power stations}} were projected to consume {{a significant proportion of}} the bay's waters each day for cooling. After extensive negotiations and litigation with both the state and with Ludwig, who owned lands needed for cooling water canals, a closed-loop canal system was built south of the power <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nuclear units became operational in the early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|It is {{sometimes}} forgotten that the plants described in herbals were grown in special herb gardens (physic gardens). Such herb gardens were, for example, {{part of the}} medieval monastery garden that supplied the simples or officinals used to treat the sick being cared for within the monastery. Early physic gardens were also associated with institutes of learning, whether a monastery, university or herbarium. It was this medieval garden of the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries, attended by apothecaries and physicians, that established a tradition leading to the systems gardens {{of the eighteenth century}} (gardens that demonstrated the classification system of <b>plants)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> modern botanical garden. The advent of printing, woodcuts and metal engraving improved the means of communication. Herbals prepared the ground for modern botanical science by pioneering plant description, classification and illustration. From the time of the ancients like Dioscorides through to Parkinson in 1629, the scope of the herbal remained essentially the same.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{attended}} the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from 11 September 1939 to 3 February 1940. He then became {{executive officer of}} the 1st Engineers.

He became District Engineer of the Binghamton District on 25 May 1940, with the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Army of the United States from 12 June 1941. On 31 January 1942, he became District Engineer of the Syracuse District, which covered New York and part of Pennsylvania, with the rank of colonel from 1 February 1942. At Binghamton and Syracuse was responsible for a number of major projects, including ammunition and explosive <b>plants,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> construction of the Rome Air Depot.

In turn, the actual construction and operation of the pipelines would be carried out by the War Emergency Pipelines company (WEP), a non-profit corporation backed by a consortium of the largest oil companies in the United States: Atlantic Refining, Cities Service Oil, Consolidated Oil, Gulf Oil, Pan American Petroleum and Transportation, Standard Oil, Tidewater Associated Oil, Shell Oil, Socony-Vacuum Oil, Sun Oil and the Texas Pipe Line Company. The WEP was led by W. Alton Jones and Burt Hull, both with extensive backgrounds in the industry, with Oscar Wolfe as its chief engineer. The company established its offices in Little Rock, Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{chemical}} processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy {{that would otherwise}} come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions {{can be divided into}} thermochemical or photochemical. A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis. The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as methanol) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system. Another vision involves all human structures covering the earth's surface (i.e., roads, vehicles and buildings) doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants.|$|E

5|$|The same {{applies to}} herbivores, animals that eat <b>plants,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> plants that they eat. In the Rocky Mountains, red {{squirrels}} and crossbills (seed-eating birds) compete for {{seeds of the}} lodgepole pine. The squirrels get at pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales, whereas the crossbills get at the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are squirrels, the lodgepole's cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, {{making it more difficult}} for squirrels to get at the seeds. Conversely, where there are crossbills but no squirrels, the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making it more difficult for crossbills to get at the seeds. The lodgepole's cones are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.|$|E
