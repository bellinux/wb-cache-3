This <b>proposed</b> <b>action</b> was dubbed the Weygand Plan after General Maxime Weygand, appointed Supreme Commander after Gamelin's dismissal on 18 May. On 25 May, Gort had to abandon any hope of achieving this objective and withdrew on his own initiative, along with Blanchard's forces behind the Lys Canal, part of a canal system that reached the sea at Gravelines. Sluice gates had already been opened all along the canal to flood the system and create a barrier (the Canal Line) against the German advance.|$|E
5|$|Caldwell {{is perhaps}} best {{known as one of}} the {{principal}} architects of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the first act of its kind in the world, signed into law on January 1, 1970. In drafting A National Policy on the Environment in 1968 as consultant to Senator Henry Jackson, the head of the powerful Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, Caldwell realized that more was needed than a mere a policy statement: an “action-forcing mechanism” would be necessary to secure federal agency compliance with the Act’s requirements. The origin of the requirement for preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been attributed to Caldwell, whose testimony at the Senate hearing in April 1969 laid the groundwork for inclusion of provisions requiring an evaluation of the effects of all major federal projects significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. In these “detailed statements,” as they were termed in the Act, all reasonably foreseeable social, economic, and environmental effects of a <b>proposed</b> <b>action</b> and any possible alternatives to it must be identified and assessed before any federal action takes place.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was deeply}} {{concerned}} that Ernst Röhm, {{the chief of}} the SA, was planning a coup. Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA. Members of the SA got wind of the <b>proposed</b> <b>action</b> and thousands of them took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined who else should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the Night of the Long Knives. Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich. A retroactive law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} is a Regulatory Impact Review (RIR) and Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) for seven <b>proposed</b> <b>actions</b> to amend halibut and sablefish Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) regulations {{under the authority}} of the National Marine Fisheries Service. The <b>proposed</b> <b>actions</b> are: (1) allow the use of medical transfers; (2) tighten the criteria allowing the use of hired skippers; (3) add vessel clearance requirements to the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands sablefish fisheries; (4) amend the sablefish product recovery rate for bled sablefish; (5) amend the halibut block program; (6) amend halibut quota share categories; and (7) amend fishdown regulations. RIR: None of the <b>proposed</b> <b>actions</b> are expected to have the potential to result in a “significant action ” as defined in Executive Order 12866. IRFA: The <b>proposed</b> <b>actions</b> are not expected to result in adverse impacts on directly regulated small entities. NEPA: The <b>proposed</b> <b>actions</b> are categorically excluded from the requirement for preparing an environment assessment because {{they do not have the}} potential to significantly affect the human environment.

Biological assessments (BAs) addressing the potential effects to these species accompanied the letters. The BAs describe the environmental baseline and effects of <b>proposed</b> <b>actions</b> on OC coho salmon and its critical habitat and this biological opinion (Opinion) analyzes the <b>proposed</b> <b>actions</b> described in the BAs. The <b>proposed</b> <b>actions</b> would have short-term adverse effects on OC coho salmon and its habitat, but are expected to provide long-term beneficial effects. The OC coho salmon evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) was listed by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) on August 10, 1998 (63 FR 42587). Critical habitat for this species was designated on February 16, 2000 (65 FR 7764). The UNF made the effects determinations in the BAs following procedures described in NMFS (1996). This document serves as NMFS's biological opinion for OC coho salmon. The objective of this Opinion is to determine whether the <b>proposed</b> <b>actions</b> are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of OC coho salmon or destroy or adversely modify designated critical habitat for OC coho salmon.

In one sense, indeed, {{it seemed as if}} denouncing the guilt of Staunton, the cause of her sister's errors and misfortunes, would have been an act of just, and even providential retribution. But Jeanie, in the strict and severe tone of morality in which she was educated, had to consider not only the general aspect of a <b>proposed</b> <b>action,</b> but its justness and fitness in relation to the actor, before she could be, according to her own phrase, free to enter upon it. What right had she to make a barter between the lives of Staunton and of Effie, and to sacrifice the one {{for the safety of the}} other? His guilt--that guilt for which he was amenable to the laws--was a crime against the public indeed, but it was not against her.|$|E

40|$|COOP) {{has been}} {{developed}} to enable distributed investigators to collaboratively operate ocean observatory systems. COOP is being created within the Autonomous Ocean Sampling Network program to support the Adaptive Sampling and Prediction (ASAP) field experiment that occurred in Monterey Bay {{in the summer of}} 2006. ASAP involved the day-to-day participation of a large group of researchers with ties to geographically diverse institutions throughout North America. These investigators had to interact on a continual basis to optimize data collection and analysis. While some investigators needed to be physically present to launch and retrieve their assets, the long duration of the observatory made sustained co-location of researchers difficult. Likewise, future ocean observatories and observing systems (such as moored arrays and cabled observatories) will operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week over many years or even decades. Since sustained co-location of researchers for situational awareness and decision-making will be impractical, {{there is a need for}} collaborative data distribution and situational awareness tools appropriate for the ASAP experiment, and eventually, for all ocean observatories. As implemented for the ASAP team, the COOP tool set consists of several components, starting with a publicly viewable, web-based tool for reviewing the day's progress and <b>proposed</b> <b>actions.</b> Registered scientists are able to discuss the day's progress (and attach illustrative data), <b>propose</b> <b>actions</b> (and back-up those <b>proposed</b> <b>actions</b> with supporting data), and discuss and vote upon <b>proposed</b> <b>actions.</b> The tool provides links to other system components, such as a database of data collections in both original and common formats, interactive data access and manipulation tools, and pages of automatically generated graphical summaries of observational results and model forecasts.
