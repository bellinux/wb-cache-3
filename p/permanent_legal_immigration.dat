40|$|The Senate {{immigration}} bill (The Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Reform Act of 2007) includes a fundamental revision of family-based permanent immigration streams. Family-based immigration {{would continue to}} be the largest single stream of <b>permanent</b> <b>legal</b> <b>immigration</b> numerically. In addition, the backlog clearance provisions of the bill would result in expedited processing of approximately four million family-member applications during the eight years after enactment. Thus, it would be a significant period of time before the proposed familybased revisions would be fully felt. However, understanding the likely impact of such reforms is important as the country continues to debate changes to the immigration selection system...|$|E

40|$|The current {{key issue}} in the U. S. {{immigration}} policy arena is the continuing review of <b>legal</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>immigration.</b> As in the past, the <b>legal</b> <b>immigration</b> reform initiative in the 10 lst Congress {{has come from the}} Senate where Senators Kennedy and Simpson introduced, and were successful in having passed, S. 358, a bill almost identical to the one that failed in the last Congress. The bill would create two separate immigration tracks, one for families (the "family connection" track) and one for labor market-bound im-migrants (the independent immigrant track), while setting a worldwide immigration ceiling of 630, 000. This figure is about 130, 000 higher than total <b>legal</b> <b>immigration</b> to the U. S. for fiscal year 1988. This paper addresses the process of U. S. <b>legal</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>immigration</b> reform by focusing on the four major perceived problem areas of the current immigrant selection system: (i) ethnic diversity; (ii) immigration levels: (iii) family immigration and visa backlogs;and (iv) responsiveness to labor market conditions. It also offers some preliminary descriptive data on the recent U. S. legalization programs...|$|R
25|$|The United States {{immigration}} {{system provides}} channels for <b>legal,</b> <b>permanent</b> economic <b>immigration,</b> especially for high-skilled workers. For low-skilled workers, temporary or seasonal <b>legal</b> <b>immigration</b> {{is easier to}} acquire. The United States immigration system rests on three pillars: family reunification, provision of scarce labor (as in agricultural and specific high-skilled worker sectors), and protecting American workers from competition with foreign workers. The current system sets an overall limit of 675,000 permanent immigrants each year; this limit {{does not apply to}} spouses, unmarried minor children or parents of U.S. citizens. Outside of this number for permanent immigrants, 480,000 visas are allotted for those under the family-preference rules and 140,000 are allocated for employment-related preferences. The current system and low number of visas available make it difficult for low-skilled workers to legally and permanently enter the country to work, so illegal entry becomes the way immigrants respond to the lure of jobs with higher wages than what {{they would be able to}} find in their current country.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the issues of}} immigration and outsourcing in a general-equilibrium model of international factor mobility. In our model, <b>legal</b> <b>immigration</b> is controlled through a quota, while outsourcing is determined both by the firms (in response to market conditions) and through policy-imposed barriers. A loosening of the immigration quota reduces outsourcing, enriches capitalists, leads to losses for native workers, and raises national income. If the nation targets an exogenously determined immigration level, the second-best outsourcing tax can be either positive or negative. If {{in addition to the}} immigration target there is a wage target (arising out of income distribution concerns), an outsourcing subsidy is required. The analysis is extended to consider illegal immigration and enforcement policy. A higher <b>legal</b> <b>immigration</b> quota will lead to more illegal immigration if skilled and unskilled labor are complements in production. If the two kinds of labor are complements (substitutes), national income increases (decreases) monotonically with the level of <b>legal</b> <b>immigration...</b>|$|R
