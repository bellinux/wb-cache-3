40|$|The flow-reversal {{elliptical}} cylindrical end chamber mufflers {{of short}} length are used {{often in the}} modern day automotive exhaust systems. The conventional 1 -D axial plane wave theory {{is not able to}} predict their acoustical attenuation performance {{in view of the fact}} that the chamber length is not enough for the evanescent 3 -D modes generated at the junctions to decay sufficiently for frequencies below the cut-off frequency. Also, due to the large area expansion ratio at the inlet, the first few higher order modes get cut on even in the low frequency regime. This necessitates a 3 -D FEM or 3 -D BEM analysis, which is cumbersome and time consuming. Therefore, an ingenious 1 -D transverse plane wave theory is developed by considering plane wave propagation along the major-axis of the elliptical section, whereby a 2 -port axially short elliptical and circular chamber muffler is characterized by means of the transfer matrix [T] or impedance matrix [Z]. Two different approaches are followed: (1) a numerical scheme such as the Matrizant approach, and (2) an analytical approach based upon the Frobenius series solution of the Webster’s equation governing the transverse plane wave propagation. The convective effects of mean flow are neglected; however the dissipative effects at the ports are taken into account. The TL predicted by this 1 -D transverse plane wave analysis is compared with that obtained by means of the 3 -D analytical approach and numerical (FEM/BEM) methods. An excellent agreement is observed between this simplified 1 -D approach and the 3 -D approaches at least up to the cut-on frequency of the (1, 1) even mode in the case of elliptical cylindrical chambers, or the (1, 0) mode in the case of circular cylindrical chambers, thereby validating this 1 -D transverse plane wave theory. The acoustical attenuation characteristics of such short chamber mufflers for various configurations are discussed, qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Moreover, the Frobenius series solution enables one to obtain non-dimensional frequencies for determining the resonance peak and trough in the TL graph. The use of this theory is, however, limited to configurations in which both the ports are located along the major axis in the case of elliptical chambers and along the same diameter for circular chambers. The method of cascading the [T] matrices of the 2 -port elements cannot be used to analyze a network arrangement of 2 -port elements owing to the non-unique direction of wave propagation in such a network of acoustic elements. Although, a few papers are found in the literature reporting the analysis of a network of 2 -port acoustic elements, no work is seen on the analysis of a network of multi-port elements having more than two external ports. Therefore, a generalized algorithm is proposed for analyzing a general network arrangement of linear multi-port acoustic elements having N inlet ports and M outlet ports. Each of these multi-port elements constituting the network may be interconnected to each other in an arbitrary manner. By appropriate book-keeping of the equations obtained by the [Z] matrix characterizing each of the multi-port and 2 -port elements along with the junction laws (which imply the equality of acoustic pressure and conservativeness of mass velocity at a multi-port junction), an overall connectivity matrix is obtained, whereupon a global [Z] matrix is obtained which characterizes the entire network. Generalized expressions are derived for the evaluation of acoustic performance evaluation parameters such as transmission loss (TL) and insertion loss (IL) for a multiple inlet and multiple outlet (MIMO) system. Some of the characteristic properties of a general multi-port element are also studied in this chapter. The 1 -D axial and transverse plane wave analysis is used to characterize axially long and short chambers, respectively, in terms of the [Z] matrix. Different network arrangements of multi-port elements are constructed, wherein the TL performance of such MIMO networks obtained on the basis of either the 1 -D axial or 1 -D transverse plane wave theory are compared with 3 -D FEA carried on a commercial software. The versatility of this algorithm is that it can deal with more than two external or terminal ports, i. e., one can have multiple inlets and outlets in a complicated acoustic network. A generalized approach/algorithm is presented to characterize rigid wall reactive multi-port chamber mufflers of different geometries by means of a 3 -D analytical formulation based upon the modal expansion and the uniform piston-driven model. The geometries analyzed here are rectangular plenum chambers, circular cylindrical chamber mufflers with and without a <b>pass</b> <b>tube,</b> elliptical cylindrical chamber mufflers, spherical and hemispherical chambers, conical chamber mufflers with and without a co-axial <b>pass</b> <b>tube</b> and sectoral cylindrical chamber mufflers of circular and elliptical cross-section as well as sectoral conical chamber mufflers. Computer codes or subroutines have been developed wherein by choosing appropriate mode functions in the generalized pressure response function, one can characterize a multi-port chamber muffler of any of the aforementioned separable geometrical shapes in terms of the [Z] matrix, subsequent to which the TL performance of these chambers is evaluated in terms of the scattering matrix [S] parameters by making use of the relations between [Z] and [S] matrices derived earlier. Interestingly, the [Z] matrix approach combined with the uniform piston-driven model is indeed ideally suited for the 3 -D analytical formulation inasmuch as regardless of the number of ports, one deals with only one area discontinuity at a time, thereby making the analysis convenient for a multi-port muffler configuration with arbitrary location of ports. The TL characteristics of SISO chambers corresponding to each of the aforementioned geometries (especially the elliptical cylindrical chamber) are analyzed in detail with respect to the effect of chamber dimensions (chamber length and transverse dimensions), and relative angular and axial location of ports. Furthermore, the analysis of SIDO (i. e., single inlet and double outlet) chamber mufflers is given special consideration. In particular, we examine (1) the effect of additional outlet port (second outlet port), (2) variation in the relative angular or axial location of the additional or second outlet port (keeping the location of the inlet port and the outlet ports of the original SISO chamber to be constant) and (3) the effect of interchanging the location of the inlet and outlet ports on the TL performance of these mufflers. Thus, design guidelines are developed for the optimal location of the inlet and outlet ports keeping in mind the broadband attenuation characteristics for a single inlet and multiple outlet (SIMO) system. The non-dimensional limits up to which a flow-reversal elliptical (or circular) cylindrical end chamber having an end-inlet and end-outlet configuration is acoustically short (so that the 1 -D transverse plane wave theory is applicable) and the limits beyond which it is acoustically long (so that the 1 -D axial plane wave theory is applicable) is determined in terms of the ratio or equivalently, in terms of the ratio. Towards this end, two different configurations of the elliptical cylindrical chamber are considered, namely, (1) End-Offset Inlet (located along the major-axis of the ellipse) and End-Centered Outlet (2) End-Offset Inlet and End-Offset Outlet (both the ports located on the major-axis of the ellipse and at equal offset distance from the center). The former configuration is analyzed using 3 -D FEA simulations (on SYSNOISE) while the 3 -D analytical uniform piston-driven model is used to analyze the latter configuration. The existence of the higher order evanescent modes in the axially long reversal chamber at low frequency (before the cut-on frequency of the (1, 1) even mode or (1, 0) mode) causes a shift in the resonance peak predicted by the 1 -D axial plane wave theory and 3 -D analytical approach. Thus, the 1 -D axial plane wave analysis is corrected by introducing appropriate end correction due to the modified or effective length of the elliptical cylindrical chamber. An empirical formulae has been developed to obtain the average non-dimensional end correction for the aforementioned configurations as functions of the expansion ratio, (i. e.,), minor-axis to major-axis ratio, (i. e.,) and the center-offset distance ratio, (i. e.,). The intermediate limits between which the chamber is neither short nor long (acoustically) has also been obtained. Furthermore, an ingenious method (Quasi 1 -D approach) of combining the 1 -D transverse plane wave model with the 1 -D axial plane wave model using the [Z] matrix is also proposed for the end-offset inlet and end-centered outlet configuration. A 3 -D analytical procedure has also been developed which also enables one to determine the end-correction in axially long 2 -port flow-reversal end chamber mufflers for different geometries such as rectangular, circular and elliptical cylindrical as well as conical chambers, a priori to the computation of TL. Using this novel analytical technique, we determine the end correction for arbitrary locations on the two end ports on the end face of an axially long flow-reversal end chamber. The applicability of this method is also demonstrated for determination of the end corrections for the 2 -port circular cylindrical chamber configuration without and with a <b>pass</b> <b>tube,</b> elliptical cylindrical chambers as well as rectangular and conical chambers...|$|E

40|$|Flow {{reversal}} chambers {{are mainly}} used {{to accomplish a}} compact silencer design needed on a vehicle. Generally in this configuration the inlet and outlet ports {{are on the same}} face and the flow direction is reversed. During many years different authors have tried to develop 1 D and 3 D models for evaluating the acoustic performance of circular and rectangular reversing chambers. Ih [1] categorizes four methods for evaluating the acoustic performance of the reversing chamber. The first involves utilizing analysis techniques for other types of muffler elements having similar acoustic performances [2]. Analysis techniques for extended inlet/outlet expansion chambers may be used to approximate the behavior of a reversing chamber in which the length-to-diameter ratio is large. When the length-to-diameter ratio is small, the reversing chamber approximates the behavior of a short expansion chamber. In this case, exact predictions of the acoustic performances cannot be made and, moreover, the method itself is a trial-and-error one. The second is a mode-matching method at the discontinuities [3 - 5], but this is tedious to formulate and the transmission matrix for this type of muffler has not been obtained. A simplified version (third method) of this method has been developed for plane wave propagation, in which the sound pressures and particle velocities at the area discontinuities are matched [6, 7]. However, this method is restricted to a very small frequency range below the cut-off frequency of the first asymmetric mode, i. e., the (1, 0) mode, and the peaks of the transmission loss curves are not correctly predicted due to the disregard of the higher order modes. Furthermore, when the length-to-diameter ratio is small, the actual acoustic performance deviates appreciably from the theoretical transmission loss predicted by this one-dimensional analysis method. The fourth method involves using numerical methods such as finite element analysis [8] and the finite difference method [9], or possibly, the boundary element method. These numerical techniques have some merits in the treatment of more complicated geometries, such as that of an elliptic cross-section and/or a chamber with a <b>pass</b> <b>tube</b> [10], but a great many mesh points or mesh elements are required to deal with the high frequency range, so that the execution time for computation is long and the costs are high. It is also difficult to describe the total exhaust system by incorporating the transmission matrix of each silencer element. Lindborg et al. [11] modeled the flow reversal chamber by two port method. The system under study is broken down into a set of linear subcomponents that are described individually and then assembled in a network. Each component is treated as a black box that is defined at the inlet and outlet ports where plane waves are assumed. This is an efficient tool, but for complicated geometries such as the flow reversal chamber the decomposition into subcomponents is not obvious. Three different approaches are used for the two port modeling of a flow reversal [11]; 1 - Large quarter wave resonator 2 - More detailed representation consisting of cones and quarter wave resonators 3 - A simplification of the second approach into a simple Pipe 6 From the results of this study, it can be concluded that the acoustic characteristics of shallow flow reversal chambers can be modeled, with engineering precision, up to cut on frequency of the first higher order mode using simple two-port elements. Good results were achieved modeling the flow reversal chamber as a simple straight duct connecting the inlet and the outlet. Munjal [12] devised a numerical collocation method. This method is easily applicable to rectangular as well as circular expansion chambers, but is limited to integer multiple area expansion ratios due to its inherent concept of discrete geometrical partitioning. Analytical methods have been introduced over the years. These methods fall into two main groups, one-dimensional and three-dimensional models. However as Ih [13] has mentioned, if the length of the chamber is much shorter than its width, then a large number of modes should be counted for calculating transmission loss even for the very low frequency range and this fact, arising mainly from the higher order acoustic modes generated at area discontinuities which do not fully decay before they reach the counterpart port, because the inlet and outlet are very close to each other. This leakage phenomenon means that the one-dimensional models are quite far from the actual performances even in the low frequency region. Three-dimensional models provide a very simple and exact approach to theoretical prediction of acoustical performance of plenum and reversing chambers. A three-dimensional mathematical formulation for mufflers with circular or rectangular cross-section with arbitrary location of inlet/outlet is derived by using the Eigen function expansion technique by Ih [13, 14]. The same problem is solved by the use of Green's function by Kim and Kang [15] for circular chambers and by Venkatesham et al. [16] for rectangular chambers. These methods take into account the effect of higher order modes which is necessary for successful analysis of a flow reversal chamber. The basic idea for these models {{stems from the fact that}} these chambers are in general regular in shape, which permits the use of series of orthogonal eigenfunctions. However, mufflers used in industry are not exactly rectangles or cylinders. Usually they are a bit curved at the edges to increase the stiffness. It is of interest for industry to know how this difference can alter the TL curve. This problem can be solved by FEM, however this method would be expensive and time consuming. One purpose of this thesis work is to investigate other methods for predicting TL of such chambers. One method could be to approximate the chamber which is curved at the edges with one which has sharp edges and then use the available theoretical models like the Green's function method to get TL curve. In the present study we want to find out how to do this approximation. The other possible method can be Neural Network. However this method needs some training data to train the neural network. Data for training can be obtained either through experiment or FEM. The effect of mean flow velocity is not studied here; However it has been found to be of negligible effect when Mach number is smaller than about 0. 03 [17]. Besides, when the mean flow velocity is smaller than about M = 0. 1, the convective contributions can be considered as negligible second order quantities and flow-generated noise may often be neglected. Further, if the mean flow velocity is small, the flow-generated 7 noise as well as pressure losses can be greatly reduced without degradation of the acoustic performance by streamline guidance: i. e., by using special l/O connecting geometries such as bell mouths and perforated bridges with high perforation ratios over 20 % [14]...|$|E

Clinically, the child exhibited classical triad of epigastric distension, unproductive retching and inability to <b>pass</b> a nasogastric <b>tube.</b> Successful operative management is presented and relevant literature is discussed...|$|R

However, it is not easy that conventional polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>pass</b> through i-gel in emergent intubation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

500|$|Because {{it is an}} {{invasive}} {{and uncomfortable}} medical procedure, intubation is usually performed after administration of general anesthesia and a neuromuscular-blocking drug. It can however be performed in the awake patient with local or topical anesthesia or in an emergency without any anesthesia at all. Intubation is normally facilitated by using a conventional laryngoscope, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope, or video laryngoscope to identify the vocal cords and <b>pass</b> the <b>tube</b> between them into the trachea instead of into the esophagus.

50|$|Alternatively, rockets may {{use more}} common {{construction}} {{materials such as}} aluminium, steel, nickel or copper alloys and employ cooling systems that prevent the construction material itself becoming too hot. Regenerative cooling, where the propellant is <b>passed</b> through <b>tubes</b> around the combustion chamber or nozzle, and other techniques, such as curtain cooling or film cooling, are employed to give longer nozzle and chamber life. These techniques ensure that a gaseous thermal boundary layer touching the material is kept below the temperature which would cause the material to catastrophically fail.|$|R
