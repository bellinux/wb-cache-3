New internet technology and social media websites effected PR strategies and tactics. In April 1999, four managers from IBM, Sun Microsystems, National Public Radio and Linux Journal created [...] "The Cluetrain Manifesto." [...] The Manifesto established 95 theses {{about the way}} social media and internet technologies were going to change business. It concluded that markets had become [...] "smarter and faster than most companies," [...] because stakeholders were getting information from each other. The Manifesto [...] "created a storm" [...] with strong detractors and supporters. That same year, Seth Godin published a book on <b>permission</b> <b>marketing,</b> which advocated against advertising and in favor of marketing that is useful and educational. While initially controversial, by 2006 it became commonly accepted that social media had {{an important role in}} public relations.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the biological origin of injectable unfractioned heparin available in Brazilian market by discussing {{the impact of}} the profile of commercial products and the changes in heparin monograph on the drug safety. MethodsThe Anvisa database for the Registered Products of Pharmaceutical Companies and the Dictionary of Pharmaceutical Specialties (DEF 2008 / 2009) were searched. A survey with industries having an active <b>permission</b> for <b>marketing</b> the drug in Brazil was conducted. ResultsFive companies were granted a <b>permission</b> to <b>market</b> unfractioned heparin in Brazil. Three of them are porcine in origin and two of them are bovine in origin, with only one explicitly showing this information in the package insert. The effectiveness and safety of heparin studied in non-Brazilian populations may not represent the Brazilian reality, since most countries no longer produce bovine heparin. The currently marketed heparin has approximately 10 % less anticoagulant activity than that previously produced and this change may have clinical implications. ConclusionsEvidence about the lack of dose interchangeability between bovine and porcine heparins and the unique safety profile of these drugs indicates the need to follow the treatment and the patients’ response. Events threatening the patient's safety must be reported to the pharmacovigilance system in each particular country...|$|R
