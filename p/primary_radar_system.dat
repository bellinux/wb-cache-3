50|$|Chain Home was the <b>primary</b> <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> for the UK {{for only}} a short time. By 1942, many of its duties had {{been taken over by}} the far more {{advanced}} AMES Type 7 GCI radar systems. Whereas CH scanned an area perhaps 100 degrees wide and required considerable effort to take measurements, the Type 7 scanned the entire 360 degree area around the station, and presented it on a plan position indicator, essentially a real-time two-dimensional map of the airspace around the station. Both fighters and bombers appeared on the display, and could be distinguished using Identification friend or foe (IFF) signals. The data from this display could be read directly to the intercepting pilots, without the need for additional operators or control centres.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2003, {{a second}} series of flight demonstrations {{focusing}} on [...] "non-cooperative" [...] aircraft (those without operating transponders), {{was conducted in}} restricted airspace near Mojave, California., again using the Proteus as a surrogate UAV. Proteus was equipped with a small Amphitech OASys 35 GHz <b>primary</b> <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> to detect potential intruder aircraft on simulated collision courses. The radar data was sent directly to the ground station as well as via an Inmarsat satellite system installed on Proteus. A mix of seven intruder aircraft, ranging from a sailplane to a high-speed jet, flew 20 scenarios over a four-day period, one or two aircraft at a time. In each case, the radar picked up the intruding aircraft at ranges from 2.5 to 6.5 mi, depending on the intruder's radar signature. Proteus' remote pilot on the ground was able to direct Proteus to take evasive action if needed.|$|E
25|$|In a radar set, the magnetron's {{waveguide}} {{is connected}} to an antenna. The magnetron is operated with very short pulses of applied voltage, resulting in a short pulse of high power microwave energy being radiated. As in all <b>primary</b> <b>radar</b> <b>systems,</b> the radiation reflected off a target is analyzed to produce a radar map on a screen.|$|R
50|$|Secondary {{surveillance}} radar (SSR) is a <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> used in {{air traffic control}} (ATC), that not only detects and measures the position of aircraft i.e. bearing, but also requests additional information from the aircraft itself such as its identity and altitude. Unlike <b>primary</b> <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> that measure the bearing of targets using the detected reflections of radio signals, SSR relies on targets equipped with a radar transponder, that replies to each interrogation signal by transmitting a response containing encoded data. SSR {{is based on the}} military identification friend or foe (IFF) technology originally developed during World War II, therefore the two systems are still compatible. Monopulse secondary {{surveillance radar}} (MSSR), Mode S, TCAS and ADS-B are similar modern methods of secondary surveillance.|$|R
5000|$|Expense - ADS-B ground {{stations}} are significantly cheaper {{to install and}} operate compared to <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> used by ATC for aircraft separation and control.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, the {{aircraft}} has other mission capabilities like {{identification friend or foe}} (IFF), electronic and communication support measures, C-band line-of-sight and Ku-band SATCOM datalinks, etc., {{similar to those}} on the AWACS and CAEW systems. The important modes of operation of the <b>primary</b> <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> are the surface surveillance and the air surveillance. The sensor has the abilities to search, track-while-scan, priority tracking, high performance tracking, etc. In priority tracking, the targets will be placed in full track mode even if these cross the primary surveillance area. In high performance tracking, additional measurements will be made to improve the tracking accuracy. Utilising active aperture technology, the radar provides a fast-beam agile system that can operate in several modes concurrently. Inter-operability with AWACS, other AEW&C aircraft, fighters and ground-exploitation stations is ensured using the data-links with voice and data channels. The aircraft cabin houses five operator work stations to adequately meet requirements of the operational mission tasks.|$|E

50|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> at Mt Hebo AFS {{included}} the FPS-24 search radar, and the FPS-26A and FPS-90 height finder radars. The FPS-26A was modified between 1967 and 1970 into the FSS-7 Sea launched ballistic Missile (SLBM) sensor and tracking radar. When the third FPS-24 radome {{was destroyed in}} 1968, the FPS-24 was replaced by an FPS-27 search radar with a smaller radar antenna and radome. Connectivity to the SAGE system was through the FST-2B. Ground to air radio communications were provided in two ways. First was digital data sent to the aircraft (F-106) via the GKA-5 digital data link system's modified GRT-3 UHF radio. Second was voice communications using the sites analog single channel GRT-3 transmitters, GRR-7 receivers and GRC-27 multi-channel (transmit and receive capable) UHF radios. All radio equipment was located at the Ground-to-Air Transmitter Receiver (GATR) site. The largest building on the radar site was the 64 ft, 85 ft FPS-24 radar tower. Surrounding this tower was a Radome Support Structure with a 140 ft, 96 ft radome to protect the 85.5-ton FPS-24 antenna from snow, ice, and high winds.|$|R

50|$|A <b>Primary</b> <b>radar</b> (PSR <b>Primary</b> Surveillance <b>Radar)</b> is a {{conventional}} radar sensor that illuminates {{a large portion}} of space with an electromagnetic wave and receives back the reflected waves from targets within that space. The term thus refers to a <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> used to detect and localize potentially non-cooperative targets. It is specific to the field of air traffic control where it is opposed to the secondary radar which receives additional information from the target's transponder.|$|R
50|$|BBC Radio Guernsey {{reported}} that two visitors to Sark enquired at their hotel {{as to what}} two bright yellow objects in the sky might be. The objects were observed during an afternoon walk on the 23rd, {{in the direction of}} Alderney. Jersey Airport Radar Control saved a radar recording of the incident, which was submitted to the CAA. These showed traces of two objects with slow north and southward movements, for a period of 55 minutes. They were recorded on Jersey Airport's <b>primary,</b> low level <b>radar</b> <b>system,</b> but not on the secondary radar used for air traffic control, which was screening out stationary objects. It remained unclear whether the radar station near Cap de la Hague, not far from the nuclear reprocessing site, observed any traces.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main runway}} (Code 3C) is fully grooved and 1552 m. [...] In 2007 the airport re-surfaced, {{strengthened}} and widened the main runway, taxiways and aprons, and installed new airfield ground lighting and a CAT 1 {{instrument landing system}} (ILS). In early 2012, a new state-of-the-art Thales <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> was installed. In 2008 a new £2.5m business aviation terminal was completed (FBO) and is operated by Oxfordjet. The airport can handle aircraft {{up to and including}} the Boeing BBJ and Airbus ACJ series. For the business aviation operator, the airport is an approximately 60 minute drive time from the West End area of central London but offers helicopter shuttles in 25 minutes to central London's Battersea Heliport which is co-owned with London Oxford Airport.|$|R
5000|$|An airport {{surveillance}} radar (ASR) is a <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> used at airports to detect and display the presence and position of aircraft in the terminal area, the airspace around airports. It is the main {{air traffic control system}} for the airspace around airports. At large airports it typically controls traffic within a radius of 60 miles (96 km) of the airport. The sophisticated systems at large airports consist of two different <b>radar</b> <b>systems,</b> the <b>primary</b> and secondary surveillance <b>radar.</b> [...] The <b>primary</b> <b>radar</b> typically consists of a large rotating parabolic antenna dish that sweeps a vertical fan-shaped beam of microwaves around the airspace surrounding the airport. It detects the position and range of aircraft by microwaves reflected back to the antenna from the aircraft's surface. In the US the <b>primary</b> <b>radar</b> operates at a frequency of 2.7 - 2.9 GHz in the S band with a peak radiated power of 25 kW and an average power of 2.1 kW. The secondary {{surveillance radar}} consists of a second rotating antenna, often mounted on the primary antenna, which interrogates the transponders of aircraft, which transmits a radio signal back containing the aircraft's identification, barometric altitude, and an emergency status code, which is displayed on the radar screen next to the return from the <b>primary</b> <b>radar.</b> [...] It operates at a frequency of 1.03 - 1.09 GHz in the L band with peak power of 160 - 1500 W.|$|R
50|$|Another type of {{transponder}} {{occurs in}} {{identification friend or foe}} systems in military aviation and in {{air traffic control}} secondary surveillance <b>radar</b> (beacon <b>radar)</b> <b>systems</b> for general aviation and commercial aviation. <b>Primary</b> <b>radar</b> works best with large all-metal aircraft, but not so well on small, composite aircraft. Its range is also limited by terrain and rain or snow and also detects unwanted objects such as automobiles, hills and trees. Furthermore, it cannot always estimate the altitude of an aircraft. Secondary radar overcomes these limitations but it depends on a transponder in the aircraft to respond to interrogations from the ground station to make the plane more visible.|$|R
5000|$|Mount Majura {{is part of}} the Canberra Nature Park, lying at {{the eastern}} end of the suburb of , which is on the {{northeast}} edge of Canberra. At the summit of Mount Majura is a radar station and aircraft warning light for the nearby Canberra Airport. The station contains a <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>radar</b> <b>system,</b> as well as transmitters and receivers for Telstra, Optus, Vodafone and a repeater for the Canberra Amateur Radio Club. Canberra's North East electricity substation is also located near the base of the mountain and is accessed via walking paths on the Ainslie side. The road primarily serves the radar station and, unlike the road on Mount Ainslie, is unavailable to the public. However, there are popular walking trails which lead {{to the top of the}} mountain from [...] and Hackett. There is also an extensive series of single track bicycle trails on the eastern side, in an area known as the Majura Pines. The hill is covered with native Australian trees, mostly eucalyptus, but is also home to a large number of highly sensitive rare plant species, including up to 26 species of terrestrial orchids.|$|R

40|$|Air {{traffic control}} (ATC) radar {{has been the}} main sensor for the {{detection}} and monitoring of commercial aircrafts for air traffic management. Typical modern ATC radar consists of a <b>primary</b> <b>radar</b> and secondary <b>radar.</b> The <b>primary</b> <b>radar</b> locates aircrafts based on the time-delay between the transmit pulses and the returns off the aircrafts. Since only location is provided, the secondary radar receives identification and flight parameters based on mode A, C or S by interrogating the transponder on board incoming aircrafts. Extensive use of radar is limited by high acquisition, installation and maintenance cost. Also, the coverage is limited by blockage due to obstacles such as buildings and mountains. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system is the next generation locating system to complement existing ATC <b>radar</b> <b>system.</b> The proposed project looks into the design of an optimum receiver to decode both ADS-B and mode S secondary radar signal. The project will consist of three parts namely; modulator, demodulator and performance verification. To ensure compatible to the industrial standards, the message format and its verification process {{will be based on}} the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organizations) standards. A non-coherent detection structure (based on energy detection) will be adopted at the receiver to improve performance at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) condition...|$|R
50|$|<b>Primary</b> {{surveillance}} <b>radar</b> {{does not}} require any cooperation from the aircraft. It is robust {{in the sense that}} surveillance outage failure modes are limited to those associated with the ground <b>radar</b> <b>system.</b> Secondary surveillance <b>radar</b> depends on active replies from the aircraft. Its failure modes include the transponder aboard the aircraft. Typical ADS-B aircraft installations use the output of the navigation unit for navigation and for cooperative surveillance, introducing a common failure mode that must be accommodated in air traffic surveillance systems.|$|R

The ships were to receive low-frequency active sonars under the Franco-German LFTASS programme but the French withdrew in 2000 and are now using a derivative of the British Sonar 2087; Bayern received the prototype TASS 6-3 sonar but it seems unlikely that more units will be ordered in the current budget environment.|$|R
50|$|Many of the CDE {{buildings}} were demolished in 1979-1980. From 1978-1981, some {{buildings on the}} site were used by Pattern Recognition Munitions for small arms ammunition development. The company also constructed a 100-yard firing range for ammunition testing. The RAF re-opened parts of the site as a manned radar station in October 1980, a Control and Reporting Post (CRP) for UK Air Surveillance. In 1986 an underground CRP was built {{as part of the}} new UKADGE (United Kingdom Air Defence and Ground Environment) project.
