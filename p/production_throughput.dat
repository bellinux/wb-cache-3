5000|$|The most {{widespread}} {{industrial application}} of ArF excimer lasers {{has been in}} deep-ultraviolet photolithography for the manufacturing of microelectronic devices (i.e., semiconductor integrated circuits or “chips”). From the early 1960s through the mid-1980s, Hg-Xe lamps had been used for lithography at 436, 405 and 365 nm wavelengths.

50|$|One of {{the most}} common driving factors is the weather, {{expressed}} usually as heating or cooling degree days. In energy-intensive processes, <b>production</b> <b>throughputs</b> would usually be used. For electrical circuits feeding outdoor lighting, the number of hours of darkness can be employed. For a borehole pump, the quantity of water delivered would be used; and so on.

The dynamic characteristics of the immersion fluid with free boundary {{play an important role}} for fluid management system, and are concerned in various potential immersion unit designs. To offer intuitive insights into the dynamic effects of the immersion fluid due to scan speeds, a lumped-parameter model based on two-dimensional (2 D) image data has been developed to characterize the 3 D hydrodynamics of the immersion flow process. To validate the model, meniscus behav-ior information under dynamic conditions is extracted experimentally and analyzed using image processing techniques. The reduced model agrees qualitatively well with the experimental data. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4024889...|$|R
40|$|Current {{maintenance}} {{policies are}} time oriented and still based on expected cost or availability optimization {{rather than being}} optimized with risk-cost considerations.

One of their major concerns is then budget allocation. They are willing to spend money if the reliability improvement of their assets is guaranteed. This paper proposes {{a new version of the}} modified bloc replacement strategy (MBRP) with a risk-cost consideration.

50|$|The most {{widespread}} {{industrial application}} of KrF excimer lasers {{has been in}} deep-ultraviolet photolithography for the manufacturing of microelectronic devices (i.e., semiconductor integrated circuits or “chips”). From the early 1960s through the mid-1980s, Hg-Xe lamps had been used for lithography at 436, 405 and 365 nm wavelengths. However, with the semiconductor industry’s need for both finer resolution (for denser and faster chips) and higher <b>production</b> <b>throughput</b> (for lower costs), the lamp-based lithography tools were {{no longer able to}} meet the industry’s requirements. This challenge was overcome when in a pioneering development in 1982, deep-UV excimer laser lithography was demonstrated at IBM by K. Jain. With phenomenal advances made in equipment and technology in the last two decades, modern semiconductor electronic devices fabricated using excimer laser lithography now total more than $400 billion in annual production. As a result, it is the semiconductor industry view that excimer laser lithography (with both KrF and ArF lasers) has been a crucial factor in the predictive power of Moore’s law. From an even broader scientific and technological perspective: since the invention of the laser in 1960, the development of excimer laser lithography has been highlighted as one of the major milestones in the 50-year history of the laser.|$|E
50|$|With {{the high}} demand of cheap, clean energy sources {{persistently}} increasing, organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices (organic solar cells), {{have been studied}} extensively to help in reducing the dependence on fossil fuel and containing the emission of green house gases (especially CO2, NOx, and SOx). This global demand for solar energy increased 54% in 2010, while the United States alone has installed more than 2.3 GW of solar energy sources in 2010. Some of the attributes which make OPVs such a promising candidate {{to solve this problem}} include their low-cost of <b>production,</b> <b>throughput,</b> ruggedness, and their chemically tunable electric properties along with significant reduction in the production of greenhouse gases. For decades, the researchers have believed that the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) would most likely remain below 0.1%. Only in 1979 Tang reported a two-layer, thin-film PV device, which ultimately yielded a power conversion efficiency of 1%. Tang’s research was published in 1986, which allowed others to decipher many of the problems which limited the basic understanding of the process involved in the OPVs. In later years, the majority of the research focused on the composite blend of poly(3-hexylthiopehene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). This, along with the research performed on fullerenes, dictated the majority of studies pertaining to OPV for many years. In more recent research, polymer-based bulk heterojunction solar cells, along with low band-gap donor-acceptor copolymers have been created for PCBM-based OPV devices. These low band-gap donor-acceptor copolymers are able to absorb a higher percentage of the solar spectrum as compared to other high efficiency polymers. These copolymers have been widely researched due to their ability to be tuned for specific optical and electrical properties.To date, the best OPV devices have a maximum power conversion efficiency of approximately 8.13%. This low power conversion efficiency is directly related to discrepancies in the film morphology on the nano-scale level. Explanations of film morphology include recombination and/or trapping of charges, low open circuit voltages, heterogeneous interfaces, grain boundaries, and phase-separated domains. Many of these problems arise from the deficient knowledge of electro-optical properties on the nano-scale level. In numerous studies, it has been observed that heterogeneities in the electrical and optical properties influence device performance. These heterogeneities which occur in OPVs are a result the manufacturing process, such as annealing time, which is explained below. Research has mainly consisted of discovering exactly how this film morphology affects the device performance.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this paper}} is to develop a pragmatic system of a <b>production</b> <b>throughput</b> {{forecasting}} system for an automated test operation in a hard drive manufacturing plant. The accurate forecasting result is necessary for the management team to response to any changes in the production processes and the resources allocations. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, we design a <b>production</b> <b>throughput</b> forecasting system in an automated test operation in hard drive manufacturing plant. In the proposed system, consists of three main stages. In the first stage, a mutual information method was adopted for selecting the relevant inputs into the forecasting model. In the second stage, a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) was implemented in the forecasting model development phase. Finally, forecasting accuracy was improved by searching the optimal smoothing parameter which selected from comparisons result among three optimization algorithms: particle swarm optimization (PSO), unrestricted search optimization (USO) and interval halving optimization (IHO). Findings: The experimental result shows that (1) the developed <b>production</b> <b>throughput</b> forecasting system using GRNN is able to provide forecasted results close to actual values, and to projected the future trends of <b>production</b> <b>throughput</b> in an automated hard disk drive test operation; (2) An IHO algorithm performed as superiority appropriate optimization method than the other two algorithms. (3) Compared with current forecasting system in manufacturing, the results show that the proposed system’s performance is superior to the current system in prediction accuracy and suitable for real-world application.

This study examined the potential application of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to modelling the throughput of production under five significant production uncertainties: scrap, setup time, break time, demand, and lead time of manufacturing. The effects of these uncertainties on the production of floor tiles were studied by performing 104 observations on the production uncertainties over 104 weeks, based on a weekly production plan in a tile manufacturing industry. The results of the ANFIS model were compared with the multiple linear regression (MLR) model.

40|$|Abstract—Throughput is an {{important}} measure of performance of production system. Analyzing and modeling of <b>production</b> <b>throughput</b> is complex in today’s dynamic production systems due to uncertainties of production system. The main reasons are that uncertainties are materialized when the production line faces changes in setup time, machinery break down, lead time of manufacturing, and scraps. Besides, demand changes are fluctuating {{from time to time}} for each product type. These uncertainties affect the production performance. This paper proposes Bayesian inference for throughput modeling under five production uncertainties. Bayesian model utilized prior distributions related to previous information about the uncertainties where likelihood distributions are associated to the observed data. Gibbs sampling algorithm as the robust procedure of Monte Carlo Markov chain was employed for sampling unknown parameters and estimating the posterior mean of uncertainties. The Bayesian model was validated with respect to convergence and efficiency of its outputs.

40|$|Material {{handling}} of compliant parts {{is one of}} the most critical and underresearched problems in the sheet metal stamping industry. The fundamental shortcoming of currently studied material handling systems for sheet metal stamping is the lack of analysis of its impact on part dimensional quality and <b>production</b> <b>throughput.</b> This paper addresses this problem by development of a generic methodology for modeling and optimization of part holding end-effector layout in order to minimize part dimensional deformation during handling operations.
