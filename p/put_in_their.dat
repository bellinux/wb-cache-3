5|$|In 1992, Joe McEwen of Sire Records {{began to}} pursue the band. McEwen, who brought notable acts such as Dinosaur Jr and Shawn Colvin to Sire, had been {{interested}} in them since hearing the Not Forever, Just for Now demo tape. At the urging of Gary Louris, McEwen offered Uncle Tupelo a contract. Band manager Tony Margherita invoked the $50,000 escape clause he had <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> Rockville contract, freeing the band to sign a seven-year deal with Sire. The deal required two albums, and specified a budget of $150,000 for their first.|$|E
5|$|These three works {{which we}} have {{composed}} we desire should be <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> hands in royal cities {{as well as in}} the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.|$|E
5|$|Back on Earth, {{the world}} is {{suddenly}} terrorised by severe natural disasters, leading Aku Aku to conclude that Uka Uka is up to something. A confrontation with Uka Uka confirms his suspicions and nearly results in his destruction {{at the hands of}} the Elementals. Aku Aku returns to Crash and Coco Bandicoot and alerts them of the current situation, disclosing that the only way to stop the Elementals is to imprison them once more with the Crystals, which have been scattered across the Earth. Using Coco's new Virtual Reality Hub System, Crash and Coco travel the world and gather the Crystals, fending off attacks from Cortex's superweapon, Crunch Bandicoot, and the Elementals along the way. However, by the time the Crystals have been gathered and the Elementals have been <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> hibernation state, Crunch's elemental powers have reached maximum capacity, forcing Crash to battle Crunch at full power in Cortex's space station. Nevertheless, Crash defeats Crunch, which releases him from Cortex's control. Infuriated by this failure, Uka Uka attacks Cortex with a fireball, only to have it hit a vital part of the space station, which causes a chain reaction that results in the space station's self-destruction. Crash, Aku Aku, and Crunch escape and return to the Bandicoot home on Coco's space fighter ship, while Cortex and Uka Uka deploy an escape pod and end up landing somewhere in Antarctica, where Uka Uka furiously chases Cortex around a small ice floe.|$|E

5|$|Coletti, Leal, Dillmann, Frijns, Ericsson, Rossi, Berthon, Binder, Giovesi, Haryanto, Rosenzweig and Abt {{were all}} {{trapped in the}} {{blockade}} {{with varying degrees of}} car damage. Nasr was near Bird and Ceccon and managed to avoid the collision between Leal and Palmer. Drivers ran back to their cars and remonstrated with marshals to enable them to take the restart. A forty-minute delay was necessitated to allow the track to be cleaned before the race could be restarted. Nine drivers had enough damage to warrant their retirement from the race: Cecotto, Leimer, Palmer, Leal, Frijns, Ericsson, Rossi, Berthon and Giovesi. The running order at the restart was determined by the order of the drivers that went through the first sector with the cars that did not enter being <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> starting position. This meant Evans led the field behind the safety car followed by Bird, Ceccon, Nasr and Calado. The safety car was withdrawn at the end of lap two and racing resumed with Evans leading Bird. Both drivers opened up a two-second advantage over Ceccon, Nasr, Calado and Richelmi. Although Evans had switched to the supersoft tyres during the stoppage Bird set consecutive fastest laps of the race on the soft tyres.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, {{plans were}} made for US 140 to be decommissioned, with PA 97 to replace the section in Pennsylvania. This {{proposal}} was made in order to eliminate short routes from the United States Numbered Highways system. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved {{the removal of the}} US 140 designation on October 28, 1977. In December 1978, the borough of Littlestown protested the renumbering of US 140 to PA 97. When the US 140 designation was retired on January 1, 1979, it was replaced by MD 140 from Baltimore to Westminster, and Maryland and Pennsylvania coordinated to have matching routes 97 {{on both sides of the}} state line between Westminster and Gettysburg. The northern terminus of PA 97 was located at the US 15 interchange, while the stretch of the former US 140 north into Gettysburg became unnumbered Baltimore Pike. With this change, the US 140 signs were removed from the square in downtown Gettysburg, and no signs directing motorists to PA 97 were <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> place. This move hurt businesses in the Littlestown area as motorists were unable to get to them without a marked route. The state did put signs directing motorists to PA 97 at the US 15 interchange and at the intersection of US 15 Business and Baltimore Street; however, signs for PA 97 were not placed in the square due to opposition from local officials in Gettysburg who did not want sign clutter in the square. The stretch of Baltimore Pike from the bypass to US 15 Business became State Route 2035 by 1989. PA 97 and the adjacent portion of Baltimore Pike were widened through the US 15 interchange in 2000.|$|E

25|$|Arkansas {{received}} {{the second half}} kickoff, but Alabama's Marquis Johnson intercepted Dick's pass on the first play of the second half, {{to set up a}} 31-yard touchdown run by Glen Coffee. By {{the end of the third}} quarter, both teams had <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> substitutes. On Alabama's first possession of the fourth quarter, backup quarterback Greg McElroy's pass was intercepted by Ramon Broadway, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass by Arkansas second-string quarterback Tyler Wilson to Michael Smith. On the first play of Bama's next drive, Roy Upchurch ran 62-yards for Alabama's final touchdown to make the final score 49–14. The 49 points were the most points scored by Alabama in an SEC game since a 59–28 victory over Vanderbilt in 1990. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Razorbacks to 9–8 (12–7 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
25|$|With {{the failure}} to {{establish}} a political consensus after the January 1910 general election, the Liberals called a second general election in December. The Conservative leadership decided that a good test of {{the popularity of the}} tariff reform programme would be to have a prominent tariff reformer stand for election in a disputed seat. They considered Law a prime candidate, and after debating it for a month he guardedly agreed, enthusiastic about the idea but worried about the effect of a defeat on the Party. Law was selected as the candidate for Manchester North West, and became drawn into party debates about how strong a tariff reform policy should be <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> manifesto. Law personally felt that duties on foodstuffs should be excluded, something agreed to by Alexander Acland-Hood, Edward Carson and others {{at a meeting of the}} Constitutional Club on 8 November 1910, but they failed to reach a consensus and the idea of including or excluding food duties continued to be something that divided the party.|$|E
25|$|The London Irish G and F Companies {{crossed the}} start-lines after a fifteen-minute warm-up by the 25 pounders, {{and they were}} soon on Points 704 and when G Company {{overwhelmed}} the position, H Company moved on to take Point 703. On the start-line they had some casualties as they had to face machine-guns from the hill and from the sides; G Company helped in silencing the enfilade fire, and when darkness came the London Irish consolidated on the ground gained. The third hill however still held out and the decision {{had to be made}} whether to wait until it had fallen, or to carry on without delay and rely on the preoccupation of the Germans with the left-flank attack. The latter course was taken; the Royal Irish Fusiliers <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> assault towards the north and rear of Centuripe, and the Inniskillings, who throughout had been in close contact with the Germans on the frontal sector, obtained a foothold on the southern edge of the village after a heavy barrage, which included scaling a 100-foot cliff.|$|E

25|$|Another {{problem of}} the Hungarian army was {{that many of the}} talented, {{experienced}} Hungarian generals, who helped in a decisive way the success of the Spring Campaign, were no more available (János Damjanich, who broke his leg; Lajos Aulich who became ill; András Gáspár) who resigned from the Hungarian army because of political reasons) and General Görgei was forced to <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> place other officers who were talented soldiers, but were not experienced as army corps leaders, many of them lacking of capacity of acting independently when it needed and they had no order to do so, but the military situation required this. So, Görgei put General Károly Knezić in Damjanich's place to lead III. corps, Colonel Lajos Asbóth in Aulich's place to lead II. corps, General Ernő Poeltenberg in Gáspár's place. General György Klapka who formerly was the commander of the I. corps, but who became temporary main commander of the main Hungarian army, called Hungarian Army of the Upper Danube (Feldunai Hadsereg), taking the place of Görgei, who became War Minister, had to give his position at the head of his corps to General József Nagysándor. These new corps commanders lacked the former generals talent, intuition and experience. Görgei himself, because of now being War Minister, had to fulfill these two heavy tasks (ministry and high commandment of the army), could not focus in the same way on the military actions as he did in the Spring Campaign.|$|E

The men from BTroop approached from behind the anti-aircraft tower, as they could still see some Germans moving about on it, they detached three men to deal with them. At the same time they stumbled across and captured a machine gun post. At 06:15 the assault started, FTroop discovered a group of Germans forming up to <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own assault on the fire base.
