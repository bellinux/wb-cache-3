The fashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the Parisians, and it knows all fashionable things. To know things otherwise were to be unfashionable. My Lady Dedlock has been down at what she calls, in familiar conversation, her [...] "place" [...] in Lincolnshire. The waters are out in Lincolnshire. An arch of the bridge in the park has been sapped and sopped away. The adjacent low-lying ground for half a mile in breadth is a stagnant river with melancholy trees for islands in it and a surface punctured all over, all day long, with falling rain. My Lady Dedlock's place has been extremely dreary. The weather for many a day and night has been so wet that the trees seem wet through, and the soft loppings and <b>prunings</b> of the woodman's axe can make no crash or crackle as they fall. The deer, looking soaked, leave quagmires where they pass. The shot of a rifle loses its sharpness in the moist air, and its smoke moves in a tardy little cloud towards the green rise, coppice-topped, that makes a background for the falling rain. The view from my Lady Dedlock's own windows is alternately a lead-coloured view and a view in Indian ink. The vases on the stone terrace in the foreground catch the rain all day; and the heavy drops fall--drip, drip, drip--upon the broad flagged pavement, called from old time the Ghost's Walk, all night. On Sundays the little church in the park is mouldy; the oaken pulpit breaks out into a cold sweat; and there is a general smell and taste as of the ancient Dedlocks in their graves. My Lady Dedlock (who is childless), looking out in the early twilight from her boudoir at a keeper's lodge and seeing the light of a fire upon the latticed panes, and smoke rising from the chimney, and a child, chased by a woman, running out into the rain to meet the shining figure of a wrapped-up man coming through the gate, has been put quite out of temper. My Lady Dedlock says she has been [...] "bored to death." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Attic tragedy still {{keeps its}} hold upon {{the loyalty of}} {{scholars}} through their imagination, or their pedantry, or their feeling of an exclusive property, as may happen, and, however alloyed with baser matter, this loyalty is legitimate and well bestowed. But the dominion of the Shakespearian is even wider. It pushes forward its boundaries from year to year, and moves no landmark backward. Here Alfieri and Leasing own a common allegiance; and the loyalty to him is one not of guild or tradition, but of conviction and enthusiasm. Can this be said of any other modern? of robust Corneille? of tender Racine? of Calderon even, with his tropical warmth and vigor of production? The Greeks and he are alike and alone in this, and for the same reason, that both are unapproachably the highest in their kind. Call him Gothic, if you like, but the inspiring mind that presided {{over the growth of}} these clustered masses of arch and spire and pinnacle and buttress is neither Greek nor Gothic,--it is simply genius lending itself to embody the new desire of man's mind, as it had embodied the old. After all, to be delightful is to be classic, and the chaotic never pleases long. But manifoldness is not confusion, any more than formalism is simplicity. If Shakespeare rejected the unities, as I think he who complains of [...] "Art made tongue-tied by Authority" [...] might very well deliberately do, it was for the sake of an imaginative unity more intimate than any of time and place. The antique in itself is not the ideal, though its remoteness from the vulgarity of everyday associations helps to make it seem so. The true ideal is not opposed to the real, nor is it any artificial heightening thereof, but lies in it, and blessed are the eyes that find it! It is the mens divinior which hides within the actual, transfiguring matter-of-fact into matter-of-meaning for him who has the gift of second-sight. In this sense Hogarth is often more truly ideal than Raphael, Shakespeare often more truly so than the Greeks. I think it is a more or less conscious perception of this ideality, as it is a more or less well-grounded persuasion of it as respects the Greeks, that assures to him, as to them, and with equal justice, a permanent supremacy over the minds of men. This gives to his characters their universality, to his thought its irradiating property, while the artistic purpose running through and combining the endless variety of scene and character will alone account for his power of dramatic effect. Goethe affirmed, that, without Schröder's <b>prunings</b> and adaptations, Shakespeare was too undramatic for the German theatre,--that, if the theory that his plays should be represented textually should prevail, he would be driven from the boards. The theory has prevailed, and he not only holds his own, but is acted oftener than ever. It is not irregular genius that can do this, for surely Germany need not go abroad for what her own Werners could more than amply supply her with.|$|E

40|$|Intercrossing {{different}} varieties of plants frequently produces hybrid offspring with superior vigor and increased yields, in a poorly understood {{phenomenon known as}} heterosis. One classical unproven model for heterosis is overdominance, which posits in its simplest form that improved vigor can result from a single heterozygous gene. Here we report that heterozygosity for tomato loss-of-function alleles of SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT), which is the genetic originator of the flowering hormone florigen, increases yield by up to 60 %. Yield overdominance from SFT heterozygosity is robust, occurring in distinct genetic backgrounds and environments. We show that several traits integrate pleiotropically to drive heterosis in a multiplicative manner, and these effects derive from a suppression of growth termination mediated by SELF <b>PRUNING</b> (SP), an antagonist of SFT. Our findings provide the first example of a single overdominant gene for yield and suggest that single heterozygous mutations may improve productivity in other agricultural organisms...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{scaling up}} of {{decentralized}} partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP) solvers towards realistic applications is mainly due to approximate methods. Of this family, MEMORY BOUNDED DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING (MBDP), which combines in a suitable manner top-down heuristics and bottom-up value function updates, can solve DEC-POMDPs with large horizons. The performances of MBDP, can be, however, drastically improved by avoiding the systematic generation {{and evaluation of}} all possible policies which result from the exhaustive backup. To achieve that, we suggest a heuristic search method, namely POINT BASED IN-CREMENTAL <b>PRUNING</b> (PBIP), which is able to distinguish policies with different heuristic estimates. Taking this insight into account, PBIP searches only among the most promising policies, finds those useful, and prunes dominated ones. Doing so permits us to reduce clearly the amount of computation required by the exhaustive backup. The computation experiment shows that PBIP solves DEC-POMDP benchmarks up to 800 {{times faster than the}} current best approximate algorithms, while providing solutions with higher values...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{studies in}} Arabidopsis {{established}} FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) {{as a key}} flower-promoting gene in photoperiodic systems. Grafting experiments established unequivocal one-to-one relations between SFT (SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS), a tomato homolog of FT, and the hypothetical florigen, in all flowering plants. Additional studies of SFT and SP (SELF <b>PRUNING,</b> homolog of TFL 1), two antagonistic genes regulating {{the architecture of the}} sympodial shoot system, have suggested that transition to flowering in the day-neutral and perennial tomato is synonymous with ‘termination’. Dosage manipulation of its endogenous and mobile, graft-transmissible levels demonstrated that florigen regulates termination and transition to flowering in an SP-dependent manner and, by the same token, that high florigen levels induce growth arrest and termination in meristems across the tomato shoot system. It was thus proposed that growth balances, and consequently the patterning of the shoot systems in all plants, are mediated by endogenous, meristem-specific SFT/SP ratios, and that shifts to termination by elevated SFT/SP ratios are triggered by mobile florigen. Florigen is a universal growth plant hormone inherently checked by a complementary antagonistic systemic system. Thus, an examination of the endogenous functions of FT-like genes, or of the systemic roles of the mobile florigen in any plant species, that fails to pay careful attention to the balancing antagonistic systems, or to consider its functions in day-neutral or perennial plants, would be incomplete...|$|R

40|$|Flowering in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) {{has long}} been {{investigated}} by plant physiologists and horticulturists aiming to increase productivity of this important fruit crop. The disruption of {{the sequence of events}} which give rise to normal evelopment of the reproductive structures by either the manipulation of the environment, hormones or mutations has provided information useful to unravel the complexity of the implicated mechanisms. In this paper, we focus on {{the early stages of the}} flowering process, analysing how flowering time and reproductive morphogenesis are regulated. Development of the reproductive structures up to anthesis, having been reviewed on several occasions in the past, is not considered. Tomato is an autonomously flowering plant with a sympodial growth habit, which means that it flowers repeatedly, at the top of an initial segment and of successive sympodial segments. The nature of its reproductive structure, a raceme or a cyme, is still questioned but available evidence supports the view that the tomato inflorescence is racemose. Flowering time is strongly dependent on the daily light energy integral and is regulated by an array of genes among which SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT) and SELF <b>PRUNING</b> (SP) play a major role. SFT is a flowering promoter particularly active in the initial segment while SP regulates sympodial development by controlling the regularity of the vegetative-reproductive switch of the different sympodial segments. Many genes specifying the identity of the meristems and floral organs interact to regulate the morphogenesis of the reproductive structures, opening a large field for future investigations...|$|R
40|$|Fruit-set in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) {{depends on}} {{gibberellins}} and auxin (GAs). Here we show, using the cv MicroTom, that application of N- 1 - naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) (an inhibitor of auxin transport) to unpollinated ovaries induced parthenocarpic fruit-set, {{associated with an}} increase of indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) content, and that this effect was negated by paclobutrazol (PAC; an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis). NPA-induced ovaries contained higher content of GA 1 (an active GA) and transcripts of GA biosynthetic genes (SlCPS, SlGA 20 ox 1 and - 2). Interestingly, application of NPA to pollinated ovaries prevented their growth, potentially due to supraoptimal IAA accumulation. Plant decapitation, and inhibition of auxin transport by NPA from the apical shoot, also induced parthenocarpic fruit growth of unpollinated ovaries. Application of IAA to the severed stump negated the plant decapitation effect, indicating that the apical shoot prevents unpollinated ovary growth through IAA transport. Parthenocarpic fruit growth induced by plant decapitation was associated {{with high levels of}} GA 1 and was counteracted by PAC treatment. Plant decapitation also produced changes in transcript levels of genes encoding enzymes of GA biosynthesis (SlCPS and SlGA 20 ox 1) in the ovary, quite similar to those found in NPA-induced fruits. All these results suggest that auxin can have opposing effects on fruit-set, either inducing (when accumulated in the ovary) or repressing (when transported from the apical shoot) that process, and that GAs act as mediators in both cases. The effect of NPA application and decapitation on fruit-set induction was also observed in MicroTom lines bearing introgressed D (DWARF) and Sp (SELT 23 <b>PRUNING)</b> wild type alleles.

40|$|The {{superiority of}} hybrids {{has long been}} {{exploited}} in agriculture, and although many models explaining "heterosis" have been put forth, direct empirical support is limited. Particularly elusive have been cases of heterozygosity for single gene mutations causing heterosis under a genetic model known as overdominance. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), plants carrying mutations in SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT) encoding the flowering hormone florigen are severely delayed in flowering, become extremely large, and produce few flowers and fruits, but when heterozygous, yields are dramatically increased. Curiously, this overdominance is evident only {{in the background of}} "determinate" plants, in which the continuous production of side shoots and inflorescences gradually halts due to a defect in the flowering repressor SELF <b>PRUNING</b> (SP). How sp facilitates sft overdominance is unclear, but is thought to relate to the opposing functions these genes have on flowering time and shoot architecture. We show that sft mutant heterozygosity (sft/+) causes weak semi-dominant delays in flowering of both primary and side shoots. Using transcriptome sequencing of shoot meristems, we demonstrate that this delay begins before seedling meristems become reproductive, followed by delays in subsequent side shoot meristems that, in turn, postpone the arrest of shoot and inflorescence production. Reducing SFT levels in sp plants by artificial microRNAs recapitulates the dose-dependent modification of shoot and inflorescence production of sft/+ heterozygotes, confirming that fine-tuning levels of functional SFT transcripts provides a foundation for higher yields. Finally, we show that although flowering delays by florigen mutant heterozygosity are conserved in Arabidopsis, increased yield is not, likely because cyclical flowering is absent. We suggest sft heterozygosity triggers a yield improvement by optimizing plant architecture via its dosage response in the florigen pathway. Exploiting dosage sensitivity of florigen and its family members therefore provides a path to enhance productivity in other crops, but species-specific tuning will be required...|$|R

It is most commonly used in contour hedgerows for erosion control, often in association with Desmodium cinereum. <b>Prunings</b> are used for mulch and green manure in alley cropping systems. Probably the most interesting feature of the species is the relative resistance of its leaves to decomposition. It is experimentally demonstrated that F. macrophylla is superior over the common Leucaena leucocephala as mulch for plantain production.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{cultural}} techniques {{can be performed}} in order to manage the spread of N. galligena. In order to minimize the number of wounds, through which the pathogen can enter, select trees that are well adapted to the local climate. In certain areas, trees {{must be able to}} resist damage due to environmental stresses such as cold temperatures. If cankers are present, it is important to prune out the damaged tissue in dry conditions. Dry conditions are unfavorable to the pathogen because it prohibits the development of fruiting structures and spore dispersal. It is essential to disinfect the equipment before and after pruning {{to prevent the spread of}} the pathogen to uninfected trees. Cankered <b>prunings</b> must be removed from the area and burned to eliminate the risk of continuing spore production. It is crucial to limit the use of high nitrogen, especially in manure, because it will encourage and facilitate the development of N. galligena.|$|E

5000|$|In China Chimonanthus was domesticated {{during the}} Song Dynasty and {{inspired}} courtly poems from the eleventh century; it flowers at the Chinese New Year, when flowering sprigs {{are used as}} hair ornaments. In China, <b>prunings</b> are dried and kept to perfume linen cupboards. The shrub was introduced to Japanese gardens from China in the early Edo period (probably between 1611 and 1629, according to Garden Plants of Japan). Its introduction into European gardens, from Japan, is noted for England, 1766, when it was grown under glass for the sixth Earl of Coventry in the conservatory at Croome Court, Worcestershire. By 1799 that shrub had grown to be 16 feet high and 10 feet wide. By that time it had been tried out of doors without winter protection and proved hardy {{in the south of}} England. Slips of it were distributed among nurserymen and so it entered European horticulture. A larger-flowered (though less fragant) variety, [...] "grandiflorus" [...] was grown by the comtesse de Vandes in Bayswater, London, before 1819. A yellow-flowered variety (luteus, 1814) is also noted.|$|E
50|$|All {{technology}} uses {{energy to}} transform the material into a desirable object or uses some form of mechanics combined with another form to make something better. The cheaper energy is, the wider the class of technologies that are considered economic. This is why technological history {{can be seen as}} a succession of ages defined by energy type i.e. human, animal, water, peat, coal, and oil. The Romans used water power, and watermills were common throughout the Empire, especially to the end of the 1st century AD. They were used for cereals milling, sawing timber and crushing ore. They exploited wood and coal for heating. There were huge reserves of wood, peat and coal in the Roman Empire, but they were all in the wrong place. Wood could be floated down rivers to the major urban centres but otherwise it was a very poor fuel, being heavy for its caloric value. If this was improved by being processed into charcoal, it was bulky. Nor was wood ever available in any concentration. Diocletian's Price Edict can give us a glimpse of the economics of transporting wood. The maximum price of a wagon load of 1,200 lbs of wood was 150 d.(denari). The maximum freight charge per mile for the same wagon load was 20 d. per mile. Room heating was normally better done by charcoal braziers than hypocausts. But hypocausts did allow them to exploit any poor-quality smoky fuels like straw, vine <b>prunings</b> and small wood locally available. Hypocausts also allowed them to generate a humid heat for their baths.|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{promotion}} of <b>prunings</b> as sources of nitrogen for crops, lack of synchronization between N mineralization from <b>prunings</b> and plant uptake remains a major limitation {{to the impact of}} <b>prunings</b> on crop yields. A laboratory and a field experiment were therefore carried out to determine the mineralization patterns of selected <b>prunings</b> and assess the potential that exists to improve synchrony by mixing <b>prunings</b> of different quality. The laboratory incubation experiment was conducted for 84 days to determine the C and N release patterns of <b>prunings</b> of different quality and the manipulation of the C and N mineralization trends by mixing <b>prunings</b> of different quality. High quality <b>prunings</b> were considered to be those with high CO 2 evolution rates and mineralize N rapidly. The % C and % N released in 84 days were highest for the high quality <b>prunings</b> of Tithonia diversifolia (70 % and 30 % respectively) and least for the low quality <b>prunings</b> of Flemingia macrophylla (25 % and - 5 % respectively). The medium quality <b>prunings</b> of Acacia angustissima and Calliandra calothyrsus had similar proportions of released C and N (about 40 % C and 10 % N). Different mixtures of T. diversifolia with other species showed contrasting influence on C release and N mineralization. Most mixtures released less C than that predicted, but in contrast most mixtures released N at a rate either matching or above the predicted. The % N released was strongly correlated with the polyphenol protein binding capacity (r 2 = 0. 53) and also with the % C released (r 2 = 0. 62). The field experiment was done for two cropping seasons {{to determine the effects of}} the <b>prunings</b> of these species and their mixtures on maize grain yield. The <b>prunings</b> were added at 5 t ha- 1 and incorporated into the top 15 cm by hand hoeing in the first season and their residual effects were monitored in the second season. Medium and low quality <b>prunings</b> produced significantly (p < 0. 05) higher maize grain yields in the first season ranging between 2. 4 t ha- 1 and 3. 4 t ha- 1 compared with T. diversifolia which produced 1. 7 t ha - 1. This suggested better synchrony in N release and uptake by maize with medium and low quality <b>prunings</b> compared with high quality <b>prunings.</b> The only mixture that indicated improved synchrony was the mixture of T. diversifolia and C. calothyrsus. This study showed that mixing <b>prunings</b> of different quality produce different patterns of N mineralization, some of which were unexpected and had a potential for improving N synchrony...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} Leucaena leucocephala and L. pallida <b>prunings</b> and cattle manure on maize {{nutrient}} uptake and yield were investigated in a hedgerow inter-cropping {{trial in the}} Ethiopian highlands. Hedgerow inter-cropping (also called alley cropping) is an agroforestry system in which trees are grown in dense hedges between alleys where short-cycle crops are grown. The hedges are pruned periodically during the cropping period and the <b>prunings</b> {{are added to the}} soil as green manure. For each leucaena species, the experiment had 16 treatments resulting from a factorial combination of four levels of leucaena leaf <b>prunings</b> (no <b>prunings</b> applied: first <b>prunings</b> applied; first and second <b>prunings</b> applied: first, second and third <b>prunings</b> (no <b>prunings</b> applied: first <b>prunings</b> applied; first and second <b>prunings</b> applied: first, second and third <b>prunings</b> applied), two levels of air-dried cattle manure (0 and 3 t dry matter ha- 1 and two levels of N fertilizer (0 and 40 kg N ha- 1 as urea). Uptake of N, P and K increased significantly with application of the three nutrient sources, but uptake of Ca and Mg either did not respond or decreased with application of <b>prunings</b> and manure. All the three factors increased maize grain and stover yields significantly, usually with no significant interactions between the factors. At least two applications of <b>prunings</b> were required to significantly increase nutrient uptake and maize yield. Maize in the row closest to the hedge did not respond to these nutrient inputs. It is concluded that hedgerow intercropping, with or without manure application, can increase crop yields moderately (to 2 - 3 t ha- 1 maize grain yields) in the highlands, but P, Ca and Mg may have to be supplied from external sources if they are deficient in the soil. Additional N is still required for higher yields (> 4 t ha- 1 maize grain yields). However, quantification of the competition effects of the trees is also required to confirm these results...|$|E

Grain and straw yields of rice were increased by 23. 8 and 32. 1 %. % 15 N atom excess (a. e.) and percent nitrogen derived from fertilizer were higher in treatment receiving 100 % chemical fertilizer compared to those with tree <b>prunings.</b> Nitrogen contribution of tree <b>prunings</b> to rice yield was 51. 3 % in D. sissoo and 54. 1 % in S. saman. The positive effect of pruning was observed in P and K uptake by rice grain and straw. Residual effect of added <b>prunings</b> in succeeding wheat crop was also noticed for both in D. sissoo <b>prunings</b> (11. 7 %) and S. saman <b>prunings</b> (11. 3 %).

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} 1990 and 1991 at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, Nigeria to study the role of earthworms in the decomposition of plant residue mulches with different qualities. Five mulches of Dactyladenia barteri, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala <b>prunings,</b> maize (Zea mays) stover and rice (Oryza sativa) straw, which had {{a wide range of}} C-to-N ratio, lignin and polyphenol concentrations were studied. Based on their chemical compositions. Dactyladenia <b>prunings</b> were defined as low-quality mulch, Leucaena and Gliricidia <b>prunings</b> as high quality-mulches, and maize stover and rice straw as intermediate-quality mulches. The mean density of earthworms (Hyperiodrilus africanus and Eudrilus eugeniae) in the experimental plots decreased in the following order: high quality>intermediate quality>low quality mulches. High quality mulch (Leucaena and Gliricidia <b>prunings)</b> supported 54 % higher earthworm populations than the (no mulch) control, whereas low-quality mulch (Dactyladenia <b>prunings)</b> only increased earthworm density by 15 %, compared to the control in 1990.
