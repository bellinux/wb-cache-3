2500|$|The {{photometry}} {{units are}} different from most systems of physical units in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light. The cone cells in the human eye are of three types which respond differently across the visible spectrum, and the cumulative response peaks at a wavelength of around 555nm. Therefore, two sources of light which produce the same intensity (W/m2) of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright. The photometry units are designed to take this into account, and therefore are a better representation of how [...] "bright" [...] a light appears to be than raw intensity. They relate to raw power by a quantity called luminous efficacy, and are used for purposes like determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination for various tasks in indoor and outdoor settings. The illumination measured by a <b>photocell</b> <b>sensor</b> does not necessarily correspond to what is perceived by the human eye, and without filters which may be costly, photocells and charge-coupled devices (CCD) tend to respond to some infrared, ultraviolet or both.|$|E

The system is provided with battery storage backup sufficient to operate the light for 10 - 11 hours daily. The project is about to develop and fabricate the circuit that can charge the lead acid battery during day time by using solar as the source. To control the circuit for charging, I have used the circuit charging that can implement {{the condition of the}} charging whether it’s in charging condition of in float condition. When charging condition, red LED will turn on until the battery reach the full charge state that is in floating condition and green LED will turn on. For the switching, I used PIC 16 F 877 A to switch on the lamp, by using the <b>photocell</b> <b>sensor.</b> The PIC 16 F 877 A will determine whether it is daytime or night time. The light will automatically on when the <b>photocell</b> <b>sensor</b> give the input to the PIC and PIC will give the output to the relay to switch on the light. To control the intensity of the light, we need the other input from the sensor. When sensor detect, PIC will give the output to switch on for the second light. So the intensity of the light will increase and the timing will start counter. After finish the counter, PIC will automatically of the second light. By using this method, its can save the energy that we using from the battery. When night change to the day, <b>photocell</b> <b>sensor</b> detect the ray from the sun, PIC will give the output to off the lamp and the charging circuit will continue charge the battery for the day...|$|E

50|$|The {{energy-efficient}} {{lighting systems}} and the extensive use of sunlight are perhaps the boldest sustainable features of the library. The glazed curtain wall is composed of glass with a low U-value for better insulating properties on {{the interior of the}} building. At times there may be too much daylight along the perimeter reading areas along the wall, so there are mechanized nylon mesh shades to soften the light and light shelves that bounce some of the strongest light off of the surface and push it deeper into the spaces. <b>Photocell</b> <b>sensors</b> on the ceilings react to daylight levels and automatically change electric lighting intensities accordingly to save energy used. Overall, 75 percent of the interior spaces meet LEED criteria for the ratio of daylight to illuminated light.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of porous alumina template morphology on silicon films growth at deposition by PE CVD has been investigated. As it was shown, the structural properties of silicon phases {{depend on the}} pore geometry and surface morphology of the anodized porous alumina substrate. In case of porous alumina formation in one stage, ripple-like morphology takes place. The growth of a-Si:H film is observed at deposition. After two-stage anodization, the porous alumina has tipped/ribbed morphology. In this case, usually a-Si:H film grows {{on the bottom of}} the pores, and nc-Si:H/a-Si:H one grows on the tips. In the case of deep pores, the nanocrystalline nc-Si:H film grows only above the top of the pores.

40|$|Paper-based point-of-care (POC) {{diagnostics}} is {{a growing}} field in global health due to the extreme portability, accuracy, affordability, {{and ease of use}} of these tests. Advancements in recent years have led to more accurate detection and improved functionality using multistep molecular diagnostics. Many such assays utilize lateral flow detection strips for visualization of diagnostic results by eye, which limits the results to qualitative Yes/No readouts. This project focused on combining recent developments in paper-based POC diagnostics to develop and optimize an in-house built quantitative paper-based diagnostic reader for lateral flow detection in low-resource settings. Initially different <b>sensors,</b> including <b>photocell</b> <b>sensors,</b> reflective IR sensors, and light-to-frequency converters were tested to optimize detection method in terms of accuracy, precision, and affordability. After the detection method was determined, the sensor was calibrated using hCG (pregnancy) test strips from Wondfo® Co. to compare the in-house detection method to a standard image quantification through the ImageJ application. These analyses will be used to calibrate the circuit to relate the light intensity calculated to the concentration of analyte (hCG) present in the sample as well as determine the lower limit of detection (LLOD). The IR reflective sensor and the light-to-frequency converter performed best due to the wide detection output range, adaptability for dark environments, and consistency in detection. We will develop and calibrate both methods for future use. The detection methods determined in this project provide a platform for a multistep diagnostic device for DNA for uses in environmental, food, and health safety, and can be applied to other paper-based diagnostics for accurate quantified results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{impact of}} swift heavy ions onto silicon oxide and silicon {{oxynitride}} on silicon creates etchable tracks in these insulators. After their etching and {{filling up with}} highly resistive matter, these nanometric pores {{can be used as}} charge extraction or injection paths towards the conducting channel in the underlying silicon. In this way, a novel family of electronic structures has been realized. The basic characteristics of these TEMPOS Tunable Electronic Material with Pores in Oxide on Silicon structures are summarized. Their functionality is determined by the type of insulator, the etch track diameters and lengths, their areal densities, the type of conducting matter embedded therein, and of course by the underlying semiconductor and the contact geometry. Depending on the TEMPOS preparation recipe and working point, the structures may resemble gatable resistors, condensors, diodes, transistors, <b>photocells,</b> or <b>sensors,</b> and they are therefore rather universally applicable in electronics. TEMPOS structures are often sensitive to temperature, light, humidity and organic gases. Also light emitting TEMPOS structures have been produced. About 35 TEMPOS based circuits such as thermosensors, photosensors, humidity and alcohol sensors, amplifiers, frequency multipliers, amplitude modulators, oscillators, flip flops, and many others have already been designed and sucessfully tested. Sometimes TEMPOS based circuits are more compact than conventional electronics...|$|R

40|$|A common {{lighting}} {{project is}} to evaluate a block of rooms for savings and payback {{from the use of}} <b>photocells</b> or occupancy <b>sensors.</b> The designer counts the fixtures to be controlled, calculates the watts used and then the expected savings. If the payback is not agreeable to the owner, the entire project is abandoned. This paper introduces a new computer-aided approach that permits the designer greater flexibility in the analysis of controls and promises a higher level of savings for any given facility, thus a shorter payback. The computer program first prompts for the data on all the rooms in a facility, including occupied hours at present and actual hours per week the lights are required. The routine then calculates the savings and payback for every room and sorts them in descending order of savings. The designer can target only those zones with the highest potential savings so limited funds can be put to best use. The program has a hall range of data entry forms and reports that output the data...|$|R
40|$|A {{common problem}} {{associated}} with patient handling {{is the risk}} of bodily injury due to acute or cumulative trauma. The objective {{of this research was}} to develop an integrated solution, using commercially available components, to help health care providers handle patients in a safe manner. The objective was achieved by retrofitting a mannequin with flex sensors, electrogoniometers, pressure <b>sensors,</b> and <b>photocells.</b> The <b>sensors</b> were capable of quantifying angular displacement, skin pressure distribution and undignified exposure. All of these variables were monitored by a computer-based data acquisition system. The design of this integrated system was implemented using National Instruments LabView software, which possessed the capability to provide both spasm simulation process control and a history of the acquired sensor data. A virtual instrument, (VI), was developed using LabView as the interface between the user or instructor and the instrumented mannequin. The VI had the capability of displaying the history of the acquired data. With access to the data 2 ̆ 7 s history the trainer is able to analyze the sensor information and verify the procedural accuracy of the actions performed on the simulated patient by the student. The system technologies employed can help the instructor improve the training of health care workers. Additionally, providing the trainer with useful information about the student 2 ̆ 7 s skill building during interaction with a patient enhances evaluation of the student 2 ̆ 7 s performance. Once the data is collected, the instrumented mannequin is capable of identifying problems such as excessive force or pressure when health care providers are interacting with patients.
