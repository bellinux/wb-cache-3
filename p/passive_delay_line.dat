40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years {{there has been}} {{extensive}} research on the application of spread spectrum multiplexing techniques for communications via optical fiber. Optical Code Division Multiplexing (OCDMA) is the technique that has exhibited the most promise as a primary multiplexing vehicle for the transition into all-optical processing of data, and as a supplement to other techniques such as Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and Wave Division Multiplexing (WDM). OCDMA can be classified into incoherent OCDMA, where coding and detection is done on the basis of optical power, and coherent OCDMA where coding is done on a field amplitude basis. The commercialization of these technologies has been a slow process as interferometic noise (know as beat noise), multiuser access interference (MAI) and optical component cost are the major hurdles. ^ This thesis concentrates on the application of incoherent OCDMA on a Fiber to the Home (FTTH) type access network where users receive information from a central terminal that is OCDMA encoded electronically. Only the user with the proper optical decoding stage will be able to discriminate and reconstruct the original information. The decoding is done via <b>passive</b> optical <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> performing a convolution between the electrical orthogonal optical code (OOC) and the impulse response of the optical <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> The result is an autocorrelation peak or a crosscorrelation that provides no outstanding optical intensity peak. ^ This document analyzes the proper autocorrelation and crosscorrelation waveforms for 2 users on this “hybrid” OCDMA coding scheme and defines threshold, beat noise mitigation and information reconstruction techniques for further expansion of the network. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{development}} and evaluation of high-resolution Time-to-Digital Converter architectures suitable for the measurement of very short time intervals {{in the context of}} the Time-of-Flight detector of the Alice experiment. The selected architectures are able to measure time intervals with a Root Mean Square (Rms) resolution better than 50 ps and a large dynamic range. Apart from the timing characteristics of such TDC's, their architectures enable the design of highly integrated multi channel converter Asic's operating with low power dissipation. The developed circuits are based on Delay Locked Loop (DLL) architectures. The feedback control loop of the DLL ensures that the time measurements are permanently calibrated in relation to a reference periodic signal. Schemes to obtain fine time interpolation without penalty in terms of added power dissipation or increased sensitivity to environmental changes (supply voltage or temperature) are investigated and implemented. Two different approaches are selected and their detailed analysis carried out.

40|$|Abstract — Auditory filter {{models have}} a history of over a hundred years, with {{explicit}} bio-mimetic inspiration at many stages along the way. From <b>passive</b> analogue electric <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> models, through digital filter models, active analogue VLSI models, and abstract filter shape models, these filters have both represented and driven the state of progress in auditory research. Today, we are able to represent a wide range of linear and nonlinear aspects of the psychophysics and physiology of hearing with a rather simple and elegant set of circuits or computations that have a clear connection to underlying hydrodynamics and with parameters calibrated to human performance data. A key part of the progress in getting to this stage has been the experimental clarification of the nature of cochlear nonlinearities, and the modelling work to map these experimental results into the domain of circuits and systems. No matter how these models are built into machine-hearing systems, their bio-mimetic roots will remain key to their performance. In this paper we review some of these models, explain their advantages and disadvantages and present possible ways of implementing them. As an example, a continuous-time analogue CMOS implementation of the One Zero Gammatone Filter (OZGF) is presented together with its automatic gain control that models its level-dependent nonlinear behaviour.

40|$|Firstly, {{the basic}} {{theory of the}} optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is reviewed. Optical <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> is one of important parts in OCT. Several types of optical <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> which were proposed and demonstrated are briefly described including their advantages and disadvantages. In this work, a novel multiple-pass cavity optical <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> (MPC-ODL) is proposed and analyzed. The proposed <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> consists of four mirrors, one lens and one resonant scanner. In this proposed <b>delay</b> <b>line,</b> the path <b>delay</b> is obtained by scanning a tilting mirror and magnified by the multiple-pass optical cavity. Thus, for a small scanning angle, a large path delay can be obtained. This <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> is especially suitable for the OCT system that will generate the large dimension images at video rate with high resolution. However, due to multiple-pass cavity used in the proposed <b>delay</b> <b>line,</b> false interference signal may be created besides OCT signal.

40|$|Abstract — Optical queues, usually {{constructed}} by optical Switches and fiber <b>Delay</b> <b>Lines</b> (SDL), {{are the key}} elements for conflict resolution in optical packet switching. It is recently shown in [3] that several optical queues {{constructed by}} SDL elements are indeed infinite dimensional switches in time {{and they can be}} constructed by many classical constructions in the switching theory. In particular, a (unicast) flexible <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> in [3] is a discrete-time infinite-server queue that corresponds to the nonblocking switch in the switching theory, and it can be constructed either by the three-stage Clos network or the Cantor network. In this paper, we propose two new constructions for multicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> that use the unicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> as the basic construction elements. The first one is constructed by using parallel unicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> It is shown that a multicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> with maximum <b>delay</b> d can be constructed by using O (√ d) unicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> with maximum <b>delay</b> d.

Fine-resolution CMOS <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> cannot simply be cascaded like optical <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> because <b>delay</b> increments are non-linear mainly due to the complex nature of the parasitic capacitance network in the delay elements of the <b>delay</b> <b>line.</b> The cascading methodology also leads to a complex PCB implementation.
