50|$|On 21 May 2002 any BOTC who was {{not already}} a British citizen {{automatically}} acquired British citizenship otherwise <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> on that day, however a person who acquired BOTC status <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> would also become a British citizen <b>by</b> <b>descent.</b>|$|R
25|$|A person born to or {{adopted by}} a parent outside New Zealand who, {{at the time of}} birth or the final {{adoption}} order, was a New Zealand citizen (<b>by</b> <b>descent</b> or otherwise than <b>by</b> <b>descent)</b> working overseas for the public service or Armed Forces of New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau {{is considered to be a}} New Zealand citizen otherwise than <b>by</b> <b>descent,</b> rather than <b>by</b> <b>descent.</b>|$|R

2500|$|... {{despite the}} above, {{if a child}} is born in Australia to two parents who are New Zealand {{citizens}} <b>by</b> <b>descent,</b> the child is entitled to Australian citizenship. This is because under New Zealand nationality law, New Zealand citizens <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> cannot pass on New Zealand citizenship <b>by</b> <b>descent,</b> therefore rendering the child stateless.|$|R
50|$|A person born {{outside the}} Overseas Territories on or after 1 January 1983 will {{automatically}} acquire BOTC <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> if either parent is a BOTC otherwise than <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> {{at the time}} of the birth. For example, a person born to BOTC parents in the UK is a BOTC <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> because the UK is not a part of BOT. However, the person is a British citizen otherwise <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> if one of his parents is also a British citizen.|$|R

25|$|The British Nationality Act 1981, {{which was}} enacted in 1983, distinguishes between British {{citizens}} and British Overseas Territories citizens.

5000|$|... : Under Canadian {{nationality}} law {{any person}} {{born to a}} Canadian citizen parent is automatically a Canadian citizen. An exception to this was introduced in 2009 to limit citizenship <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> to one generation born outside Canada: those born outside Canada within one generation of a native-born or naturalized citizen parent are Canadian citizens <b>by</b> <b>descent,</b> but their children are no longer granted citizenship <b>by</b> <b>descent.</b>|$|R
50|$|Children born to such persons after 21 May 2002 would {{automatically}} acquire British citizenship otherwise <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> at birth {{if they were}} born in the UK or on a British Overseas Territory, while those who were born outside the UK or a British Overseas Territory would receive British citizenship and British Overseas Territory citizenship <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> if one of their parents is a British citizen and British Overseas Territories citizen otherwise <b>by</b> <b>descent.</b> Generally speaking, British citizens and BOTCs <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> cannot pass down either citizenship to their offspring if they were born outside the UK or a BOT.|$|R
25|$|The Constitution was amended in 2004 {{to allow}} female {{citizens}} and citizens <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> to transmit their citizenship to children born overseas. For this to occur, citizens <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> must satisfy certain residency requirements.|$|R

50|$|This {{section is}} {{relatively}} unused since the British Overseas Territories Act 2002 came into force, as it confers citizenship <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> while registering under section 4A confers citizenship otherwise <b>by</b> <b>descent,</b> but remains {{part of the}} law.|$|R
25|$|Australian {{citizenship}} <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> is not conferred at birth, and a {{child born}} outside Australia to an Australian parent must apply for citizenship. If aged 18 or over, an applicant for Australian citizenship <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> must be of good character.|$|R

50|$|Persons {{acquiring}} citizenship by method (2) {{are called}} British citizens by descent; those acquiring citizenship by methods (1), (3) or (5) are called British citizens otherwise than <b>by</b> <b>descent.</b> British citizens <b>by</b> registration, method (4), may be either, {{depending on the}} circumstances. Only citizens otherwise than <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> can pass on their citizenship to their children born outside the UK or a British Overseas Territory automatically; British citizens <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> can pass on citizenship to their non-UK born children only by meeting certain UK residence requirements and registering them {{before the age of}} 18.|$|R

40|$|Two {{individuals}} are identical <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> at a genetic locus if {{they share the}} same gene copy at that locus due to inheritance from a recent common ancestor. Identity <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> {{can be thought of}} as a continuous process along the genome that is the outcome of a highly structured hidden process. The complexity of the structure rules out direct analytic methods for calculating likelihoods in most situations, so that a Monte Carlo approach is required. This thesis presents an approach that applies to many models for the underlying genetic process of crossing-over at meiosis. The method is applied to simulated data in order to examine the amount of information contained in identity <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> data about the true model for the crossing-over process and about the true relationship between the two individuals from whom the data derive. Much of the work is done with idealized continuous identity <b>by</b> <b>descent</b> data, but an extension to the Monte Carlo method is developed that allows analysis of real data. Real data consist of identity (not necessarily <b>by</b> <b>descent)</b> of gene copies at discrete locations along the genome. The method is applied to relationship inference analysis of a real data set...|$|R
