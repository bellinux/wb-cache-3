50|$|Crime in London, as {{in various}} cities, {{is very hard}} to measure. <b>Police</b> <b>figures</b> {{generally}} understate crime substantially and can be extremely misleading. Accordingly, recorded crime statistics need to be treated with great caution and have sometimes been shown to show opposite trends to victim surveys or to violence as measured by hospital intake. However, <b>police</b> <b>figures</b> are usually the only available way to gauge local crime.|$|R
50|$|Reepalu {{has stated}} that apart from at the infamous demonstration, {{there had not been}} any violent attacks on Jews in the city, by {{claiming}} to cite <b>police</b> <b>figures.</b> However, the same <b>police</b> <b>figures</b> show that hate crimes against Jews have doubled over the last year.

50|$|Shewan {{became a}} noted <b>police</b> <b>figure</b> in August 2011 for his tough stance on {{tracking}} down suspected looters and criminals on Tuesday 9 August 2011.

50|$|The young man's torment continues, {{this time}} caused by guilt over murdering his uncle, and he becomes {{sensitive}} to slight noises, like the tapping of a shoe or the crying of a bird.

40|$|Rarely do the <b>police</b> <b>figure</b> {{in studies}} of politics. Of all the {{institutions}} of the state, police are the great wallflowers of the political party.

Cooper was given the difficult portfolio of Corrective Services.|$|R

50|$|They {{concealed}} {{their identity}} by always using complete disguises {{so they could}} not be recognized. This included masks or theatrical makeup. They did not reveal the political affiliation or motives, viewing them as crimes with a practical goal, not public demonstrations of force or terror. During criminal activity, they never carried any papers with their real names or addresses, in order to give the other gang members time to get away before the <b>police</b> <b>figured</b> out who they arrested. They always used freshly stolen getaway vehicles equipped with previously stolen unrelated license plates.|$|R
