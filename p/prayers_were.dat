5|$|Gawhar {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of a congregational mosque for the new city and work commenced on April 4, 970. The mosque was completed in 972 and the first Friday <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> held there on June 22, 972 during Ramadan.|$|E
5|$|On the {{occasion}} of the 2nd Islamic Summit held at Lahore on 22 February 1974, thirty-nine heads of Muslim states offered their Friday prayers in the Badshahi Mosque, including, among others, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto of Pakistan, Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Muammar Gaddafi, Yasser Arafat, and Sabah III Al-Salim Al-Sabah of Kuwait. The <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> led by Mawlānā Abdul Qadir Azad, the then khatib of the mosque.|$|E
50|$|Individual <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> {{described}} by the Tanakh two ways. The first of these <b>is</b> when <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> described as occurring, and a result is achieved, but no further information regarding a person's <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> given. In these instances, such as with Isaac, Moses, Samuel, and Job, the act of praying is a method of changing a situation for the better. The second way in which <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> depicted is through fully fleshed out episodes of prayer, where a person's <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> related in full. Many famous biblical personalities have such a prayer, including every major character from Hannah to Hezekiah.|$|R
25|$|Obligatory Bahá'í <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> <b>prayers</b> which <b>are</b> {{to be said}} daily by Bahá'ís {{according}} to a fixed form decreed by Bahá'u'lláh. Prayers in the Bahá'í Faith are reverent words which are addressed to God, and refers to two distinct concepts: obligatory prayer and devotional prayer (general prayer). The act of <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the most}} important Bahá'í laws for individual discipline. Along with fasting, obligatory <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> one of the greatest obligations of a Bahá'í, and the purpose of the obligatory <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> to foster the development of humility and devotion. The obligation of daily obligatory <b>prayer</b> <b>was</b> prescribed by Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, in his book of laws, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.|$|R
25|$|<b>Prayer</b> may <b>be</b> {{expressed}} vocally or mentally. Vocal <b>prayer</b> may <b>be</b> spoken or sung. Mental <b>prayer</b> can <b>be</b> either meditation or contemplation. The basic {{forms of}} <b>prayer</b> <b>are</b> praise, petition (supplication), intercession, and thanksgiving.|$|R
5|$|Saladin, who overthrew the Fatimids in 1171, was {{hostile to}} the Shi’ite {{principles}} of learning propounded at al-Azhar during the Fatimid Caliphate, and under his Ayyubid dynasty the mosque suffered from neglect. Congregational <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> banned by Sadr al-Din ibn Dirbass, appointed qadi by Saladin. The reason for this edict may have been Shāfi‘ī teachings that proscribe congregational prayers in a community to only one mosque, or mistrust of the former Shi'a institution by the new Sunni ruler. By this time, the much larger al-Hakim Mosque was completed; congregational prayers in Cairo were held there.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s {{also saw}} a return to more {{traditional}} practices in the service, under Weider's guidance. Some members began wearing head coverings in the sanctuary, some Hebrew <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> added to the Sabbath service, and the Reform movement's new High Holy Days prayer book The Gates of Repentance was adopted. The synagogue building and Temple House were contributing properties to the Park Slope historic district, which was listed as a New York City Landmark district in 1973, and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.|$|E
5|$|The Al-Azhar Mosque was {{commissioned}} by the Caliph Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah for the newly established capital city of Cairo. Its name {{is a tribute to}} the name of Fatima Al-Azhar, the daughter of the Prophet Mohammed. Jawhar al-Siqilli, commander of the Fatimid army started construction of the mosque in 970. It was the first mosque established in the city. The first <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> held there in 972, and in 989 the mosque authorities hired 35 scholars, making it a teaching centre for Shia theology. A waqf for the mosque was established in 1009 by Caliph al-Hakim.|$|E
50|$|The aim of <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> that {{we should}} acquire from it love of God, for in <b>prayer</b> <b>are</b> to be found all sorts of reason for loving God (Brock, 1997).|$|R
50|$|Morning Prayer and Evening <b>Prayer</b> <b>are</b> said {{daily in}} the Chapel, and the Holy Eucharist is celebrated Tuesdays at 7:30 a.m. and other weekdays (except Mondays) at 10 a.m. If Monday is a Holy Day, Evening <b>Prayer</b> <b>is</b> {{followed}} by {{a celebration of the}} Holy Communion. Morning <b>Prayer</b> <b>is</b> said 15 minutes before the Eucharist. This daily round of worship and <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> part of the liturgy or work of the Cathedral. The Chapel is open every day for personal prayer and meditation.|$|R
25|$|In {{the event}} {{one of the}} <b>prayers</b> <b>was</b> missed inadvertently, the Amidah <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> said twice in the next service—a {{procedure}} known as tefillat tashlumin.|$|R
5|$|The Muslims found {{themselves}} in greater difficulties by day. Food was running short, and nights were colder. The lack of sleep made matters worse. So tense was the situation that, for the first time, the canonical daily <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> neglected by the Muslim community. Only at night, when the attacks stopped due to darkness, could they resume their regular worship. According to Ibn Ishaq, the situation became serious and fear was everywhere.|$|E
5|$|The cult of Saint Andrew {{may have}} come to Pictland from Northumbria, as had the cult of Saint Peter which had been favoured by Nechtan, and in {{particular}} from the monastery at Hexham which was dedicated to Saint Andrew. This apparent connection with the Northumbrian church may have left a written record. Óengus, like his successors and possible kinsmen Caustantín and Eógan, is recorded prominently in the Liber Vitae Ecclesiae Dunelmensis, a list of some 3000 benefactors for whom <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> said in religious institutions connected with Durham.|$|E
5|$|The {{rituals of}} Cherry’s flock {{incorporated}} many Jewish practices and prohibitions alongside some Christian traditions. For example, during prayer the men wore skullcaps and congregants faced east. In addition, {{members of the}} Church were not permitted to eat pork. <b>Prayers</b> <b>were</b> accompanied by musical instruments and gospel singing. After Cherry's death, {{members of the church}} believed that he had left temporarily and would soon reappear in spirit in order to lead the church through his son.|$|E
50|$|Beloved God <b>Prayer</b> <b>is</b> {{the name}} of a prayer {{composed}} by Meher Baba on August 25, 1959. The <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> one of three frequently recited at some gatherings of Baba followers as well as some individuals, along with the Prayer of Repentance and the Parvardigar Prayer. The three <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> repeated morning and evening at Meher Baba's samadhi in Ahmednagar, India.|$|R
50|$|The Bahá'í teachings {{state that}} {{individual}} <b>prayer</b> should <b>be</b> performed {{when one is}} alone, and when free of distractions such as {{early in the morning}} or late at night. Collective <b>prayers,</b> which usually <b>are</b> performed by individuals taking turns in reading <b>prayers,</b> <b>are</b> also encouraged; collective <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> usually performed at the beginning of meetings such as Nineteen Day Feasts, and Bahá'í administrative meetings. Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá'í Faith {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, wrote that <b>prayers</b> may <b>be</b> addressed to God, Bahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá, or other messengers from God; he recommended, however, that the <b>prayers</b> <b>be</b> addressed to Bahá'u'lláh.|$|R
2500|$|The same <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> {{added to}} the grace after meals. In addition, the Hallel (praise) ( [...] - [...] ) are sung during each morning service and the Tachanun penitential <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> omitted.|$|R
5|$|Many congregations {{gathered}} in their churches upon hearing {{news of the}} attacks, volunteering {{to spend the night}} there to protect them from further attacks. The local Catholic leaders demanded a peaceful bandh on 15 September in and around the city of Mangalore, and as a response Catholic traders and transport owners closed their shops and stopped their vehicles. A memorandum was submitted to the district council at 10.30 am, seeking protection for the lives and property of Christians. <b>Prayers</b> <b>were</b> to be held in all the 48 churches of the district on Wednesday, 17 September. On 6 October 2008, some 10,000 people from civil society and religious organisations organised a march to protest against the anti-Christian perpetrators of the attacks.|$|E
5|$|On November 14, 2015, {{the candle}} was lit {{nearly two weeks}} prior to the {{official}} ceremony date after local resident Joe Mercado posted to an Easton, Pennsylvania Facebook community page asking to light the candle to show support {{for the people of}} Paris, France after a terrorist attack the day before. Due to overwhelming response to the post, the city organized a candle light vigil that evening with several hundred residents attending. <b>Prayers</b> <b>were</b> offered in several languages, including French, and several faiths. Easton Mayor Sal Panto Jr. and Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski spoke. The candle remained lit for three days before being shut off until the official lighting event.|$|E
5|$|Wounds {{were treated}} by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads, and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection, while opium thyme and {{belladona}} {{were used to}} relieve pain. The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies. <b>Prayers</b> <b>were</b> made to the goddess Isis. Moldy bread, honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns. Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set broken bones, and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred.|$|E

50|$|In Islam, Muslims {{of their}} {{community}} gather to their collective prayers for the forgiveness of the dead, a <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> recited and this <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> known as the Salat al-Janazah (Janazah prayer).|$|R
50|$|Today, {{perpetual}} <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> {{a common}} practice in many churches. Often the term 24-7 <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> used to express that the prayer continues 24 hours 7 days a week. A notable example of current day perpetual <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> the Jerusalem House of Prayer, International House of Prayer in Kansas City {{as well as other}} prayer houses such as the Justice House of <b>Prayer</b> that <b>were</b> inspired by this ministry. Many churches organize 24-7 prayer weeks that last for one or several weeks.|$|R
5|$|Congregational <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> {{reestablished}} at al-Azhar {{during the}} Mamluk Sultanate by Sultan Baibars in 1266. While Shāfi‘ī teachings, which Saladin and the Ayyubids followed, stipulated {{that only one}} mosque should {{be used as a}} congregational mosque in a community, the Hanafi madh'hab, to which the Mamluks adhered, placed no such restriction. Al-Azhar had by now lost its association with the Fatimids and Ismāʿīli doctrines, and with Cairo's rapid expansion, the need for mosque space allowed Baibars to disregard al-Azhar's history and restore the mosque to its former prominence. Under Baibars and the Mamluk Sultanate, al-Azhar saw the return of stipends for students and teachers, as well as the onset of work to repair the mosque, which had been neglected for nearly 100 years. According to al-Mufaddal, the emir 'Izz al-Din Aydamur al-Hilli built his house next to the mosque and while doing so repaired the mosque. Al-Maqrizi reports that the emir repaired the walls and roof as well as repaving and providing new floor mats. The first khutbah since the reign of the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim took place on January 16, 1266 with the sermon delivered on a new pulpit completed five days earlier.|$|E
5|$|The festive {{kindling}} of the badnjak commemorates {{the fire}} that—according to Serbian folk tradition—the shepherds of Bethlehem {{built in the}} cave where Jesus Christ was born, to warm the Baby Jesus and his mother throughout the night. The badnjak may {{also be seen as}} a symbol of the cross upon which Christ was crucified, the warmth of its fire symbolizing the salvation which, in the Christian belief, the crucifixion made possible for mankind. Scholars regard the tradition as inherited from the old Slavic religion. They interpret the badnjak as an incarnation of the spirit of vegetation, and as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn, to whom sacrifices and <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> offered for the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family. The burning symbolized sunshine, securing the vitalizing power of the sun in the coming year. Other South Slavic peoples have similar traditions, and the custom that a family brings a log into the house and burns it on Christmas Eve has also been recorded in other parts of Europe.|$|E
5|$|The letter, {{which is}} a {{response}} to Boniface who had requested his support, reveals Ælfwald's sound understanding of Latin. Ælfwald's letter reassures Boniface that his name was being remembered by the East Angles: it contains an offer to exchange the names of their dead, so that mutual prayers could be read for them. According to Richard Hoggett, a phrase in the letter, 'in septenis monasteriorum nostorum sinaxis', has been interpreted incorrectly by historians to imply that there were at the time seven monasteries in Ælfwald's kingdom in which <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> being read, a theory which has proved difficult for scholars to explain. Hoggett argues that the words in the phrase refer to the number of times that the monks offered praise during the monastic day and not to the number of monasteries then in existence. He points out that this interpretation was published by Haddan and Stubbs as long ago as 1869.|$|E
50|$|Some Sufis, however, {{have made}} a {{distinction}} between Al-Ishraq Prayer and Duha Prayer. According to them, Al-Ishraq <b>Prayer</b> <b>is</b> done after sun rise (around fifteen minutes after) while Duha <b>Prayer</b> <b>is</b> done much later.|$|R
25|$|When two or {{more people}} gather {{together}} to pray, their <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> called communal <b>prayer.</b> Examples of communal <b>prayer</b> <b>are</b> the Rosary, devotional prayers including novenas and litanies, classroom prayers, and, most importantly, the Mass.|$|R
5000|$|The Common Table <b>Prayer</b> <b>was</b> first {{published}} in the year 1753 in a Moravian hymnal, Etwas vom Liede Mosis, des Knechts Gottes, und dem Liede des Lammes, das ist: Alt- und neuer Brüder-Gesang. The title was Tisch-Gebetgen, or Table <b>Prayer.</b> There <b>are</b> possibilities that the <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> from an older text with Lutheran origins. In the Moravian hymnal the <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> not placed in the [...] "Old Moravian Hymns" [...] chapter or in the eighteenth-century Moravian hymns" [...] chapter.

In the Evangelisch-Lutherisher Gebets-Schatz or Evangelical-Lutheran Prayer Treasures, the <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> attributed to Martin Luther, but this is highly speculated.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} expiate {{the killing of}} Oswine, who was later {{reckoned}} a saint, Oswiu established Gilling Abbey at Gilling, where <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> said for Oswine and for Oswiu. Oswine was followed as king of the Deirans by Oswald's son Œthelwald.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Vitter {{introduced}} a resolution supporting prayer at school board meetings {{in response to}} an earlier district court decision that the Louisiana's Tangipahoa Parish practice of opening meetings with Christian prayers was unconstitutional. The bill died in committee after receiving little support from colleagues {{on both sides of the}} aisle. Vitter later reintroduced the resolution in January 2007 after a panel of the Fifth Circuit Court concluded that Christian <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> unconstitutional but was undecided whether nonsectarian <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> allowed. In July 2007, the full Fifth Circuit dismissed the case because of a lack of standing. The school board subsequently resumed prayer evocations but opened it to diverse community religions. Vitter's bill died in committee.|$|E
25|$|The funeral <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> led by Jabir bin Muta'am, and {{the dead}} body was lowered into the grave without much of a ceremony.
