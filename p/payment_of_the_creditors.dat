60|$|If {{this were}} not enough, he has {{furnished}} you with other presumptions {{that are not}} to be shaken. It is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> known indications <b>of</b> guilt to stagger and prevaricate in a story, and to vary in the motives that are assigned to conduct. Try these ministers by this rule. In their official dispatch, they tell <b>the</b> Presidency <b>of</b> Madras that they have established the debt for two reasons: first, because the Nabob (the party indebted) does not dispute it; secondly, because it is mischievous to keep it longer afloat, and that <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European <b>creditors</b> will promote circulation in the country. These two motives (for the plainest reasons in the world) the right honorable gentleman has this day thought fit totally to abandon. In the first place, he rejects <b>the</b> authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nabob <b>of</b> Arcot. It would, indeed, be pleasant to see him adhere to this exploded testimony. He next, upon grounds equally solid, abandons <b>the</b> benefits <b>of</b> that circulation which was to be produced by drawing out all <b>the</b> juices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. Laying aside, or forgetting, these pretences of his dispatch, he has just now assumed a principle totally different, but to the full as extraordinary. He proceeds upon a supposition that many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> claims may be fictitious. He then finds, that, in a case where many valid and many fraudulent claims are blended together, the best course for their discrimination is indiscriminately to establish them all. He trusts, (I suppose,) as there may not be a fund sufficient for every description <b>of</b> <b>creditors,</b> that <b>the</b> best warranted claimants will exert themselves in bringing to light those debts which will not bear an inquiry. What he will not do himself he is persuaded will be done by others; and for this purpose he leaves to any person a general power <b>of</b> excepting to <b>the</b> debt. This total change of language and prevarication in principle is enough, if it stood alone, to fix <b>the</b> presumption <b>of</b> unfair dealing. His dispatch assigns motives of policy, concord, trade, and circulation: his speech proclaims discord and litigations, and proposes, as the ultimate end, detection.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was with}} them and their {{dispensation}} as this similitude gives you to understand:--Set the case that there be two men who make a covenant that the one should give the other ten thousand sheep on condition the other give him two thousand pound; but forasmuch as the money {{is not to be}} paid down presently, therefore if he that buyeth the sheep will have any <b>of</b> them before <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> <b>payment,</b> <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> requesteth a surety; and upon <b>the</b> engagement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surety there is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sheep given to the debtor even before <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> <b>payment,</b> but <b>the</b> other at and after. So it is here; Christ covenanted with His Father for His sheep--"I lay down My life for My sheep," [...] saith He--but the money was not to be paid down so soon as the bargain was made, as I have already said, yet some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sheep were saved even before the money was paid, and that because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Suretyship <b>of</b> Christ; as it is written, [...] "Being justified," [...] or saved, [...] "freely by His grace through the redemption," [...] or purchase, [...] "that is in Christ Jesus. Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for <b>the</b> remission <b>of</b> sins that are past," [...] or the sinners who died in the faith before Christ was crucified, through God's forbearing till the payment was paid; to declare, I say, at this time His righteousness; [...] "that He might be just, and <b>the</b> justifier <b>of</b> him which believeth in Jesus" [...] (Rom 3:24-26).|$|R
5000|$|Property premium {{is the key}} {{concept in}} <b>the</b> system <b>of</b> property-based {{economics}} developed by Gunnar Heinsohn, Otto Steiger, and Hans-Joachim Stadermann. It is an insight derived from the legal distinction between property and possession which is made by jurists, but not by economists. The distinction between property and possession is used by Heinsohn and Steiger to classify forms of society. [...] "Three distinctive systems of material reproduction are known to man: (i) custom or tribal societies, (ii) command or feudal societies and (iii) ownership- or property-based societies." [...] The first two are based on possession, which is a physical, material concept. Property, on the other hand, is an abstract, intangible concept, and thus can only exist as a creation of law and within the realm established by <b>the</b> rule <b>of</b> law. Where such a regime of law is established, property arises; and it is accompanied by <b>the</b> phenomenon <b>of</b> property premium. [...] "As soon as property is created it carries an unearned and immaterial premium, the property premium. This premium exists in addition to <b>the</b> physical use <b>of</b> goods or resources in their possessional state and consists of two powers: (i) its capacity <b>of</b> backing <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> money which can be created only in a credit contract and (ii) its eligibility to serve as collateral for obtaining credit." [...] It is this property premium which explains <b>the</b> phenomenon <b>of</b> interest. <b>The</b> owner gives up his property premium by using his property to back <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> that money; what he gains in exchange is interest. The borrower likewise forgoes property premium in engaging a loan, because he must back his promise of repayment with collateral, pledging his property as security for repayment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loan. What he receives in return is liquidity premium, which is the capacity to cancel indebtedness. [...] "Keynes's idea that interest is the payment for forgoing liquidity premium, therefore, falls short. <b>The</b> debtor's <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> interest materializes <b>the</b> <b>creditor's</b> property premium, while the debtor's property premium gives rise to liquidity premium." ...|$|R
5000|$|The surety's {{principal}} right against <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> entitles him, after <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guaranteed debt, to <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> all securities which <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> {{held against}} <b>the</b> principal debtor. If <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> has lost these securities by default or laches or rendered them otherwise unavailable, the surety is discharged pro tanto. This right, {{which is not}} in abeyance till the surety is called on to pay extends to all securities, whether satisfied or not.

5000|$|The most {{prolific}} ground of discharge of a guarantor usually arises from <b>the</b> <b>creditor's</b> conduct. <b>The</b> governing principle {{is that if}} <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> violates any rights which the surety possessed when he entered into the suretyship, even though the damage is only nominal, the guarantee cannot be enforced. The surety's discharge may be accomplished (1) by a variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract between <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> and <b>the</b> principal debtor, or <b>of</b> that between <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> and <b>the</b> surety; (2) by <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> taking a new security from the principal debtor in lieu <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original one; (3) by <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> discharging <b>the</b> principal debtor from liability; (4) by <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> binding himself to give time to the principal debtor for <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guaranteed debt; or (5) by loss of securities received by <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> in respect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guaranteed debt. <b>The</b> first four <b>of</b> these acts are collectively termed a novation. In general whatever extinguishes the principal obligation necessarily determines that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surety, not only in England but elsewhere. [...] By most civil codes the surety is discharged by conduct <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> inconsistent with <b>the</b> surety's rights, although the rule prevailing in England, Scotland, America and India which releases the surety from liability when <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> extends without <b>the</b> surety's consent the time for fulfilling the principal obligation, while recognized by two existing codes civil, is rejected by <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> them.
