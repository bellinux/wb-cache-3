5|$|In October 1999, Chakrapong founded Royal <b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh</b> Airways. Chakrapong raised US$2 {{million from}} {{personal}} savings and bank loans, {{which he used}} to acquire one 52-seater Antonov-24 and another 100-seater Yakovlev Yak-42 airplanes. The airlines flew domestic routes within {{the first year of}} operations and most of its customers were Chinese, Taiwanese, and Japanese tourists. By May 2001, Royal <b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh</b> Airways secured three authorizations to fly between Phnom PenhBangkok, Phnom PenhHo Chi Minh City as well as Ho Chi Minh CitySiem Reap. The airlines attempted to secure two additional routes from the Cambodian government—Bangkok-Siem Reap in August 2001 and Siem Reap-Bangkok in August 2002—but lost both bids to other airlines. Chakrapong accused the government political bias in awarding the deals due to his political affiliations. In October 2003, the director of Battambang Airport, Prum Chantha, reported that Royal <b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh</b> Airways had accumulated $1million in unpaid taxes. Chakrapong suspended domestic flights between <b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh</b> and Battambang as foreign tourists opted for land transport options to provincial capitals which were cheaper than air transport. Royal <b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh</b> Airways had already become bankrupt by March 2006 when the government presented Chakrapong a bill of $1.36 million in unpaid taxes, navigation, and landing fees. When Chakrapong failed to repay the taxes to the government, Hun Sen issued a lawsuit in March 2007 against him.|$|E
5|$|Operation Eagle Pull was the United States {{military}} evacuation by air of <b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh,</b> Cambodia, on 12 April 1975. At {{the beginning}} of April 1975, <b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh,</b> {{one of the last}} remaining strongholds of the Khmer Republic, was surrounded by the Khmer Rouge and totally dependent on aerial resupply through Pochentong Airport. With a Khmer Rouge victory imminent, the US government made contingency plans for the evacuation of US nationals and allied Cambodians by helicopter to ships in the Gulf of Thailand. Operation Eagle Pull took place on the morning of 12 April 1975 and was a tactical success carried out without any loss of life. Five days later the Khmer Republic collapsed and the Khmer Rouge occupied <b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh.</b>|$|E

The United States quickly mobilised an airlift of food, fuel and ammunition into <b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh,</b> but as US support for the Khmer Republic was limited by the Case–Church Amendment, BirdAir, a company under contract to the US Government, controlled the airlift with a mixed fleet of C-130 and DC-8 planes, flying 20 times a day into Pochentong.|$|E

40|$|<b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh’s</b> {{sanitation}} {{system is}} a combination of the drainage system and sewage system. Storm water, household wastewater, and industrial wastewater all flow together out of the city tothe detriment of the natural environment and the humans that depend on it. This continuedpersistence of an inefficient and harmful system is explored using path dependency theory. Pathdependency constrains the system to linear development and reflects the historical context inwhich decisions were made. <b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh’s</b> sanitation system is used to exemplify components ofpath dependence and their effect on implementing change. To incorporate room for change into <b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh’s</b> sanitation system, the inherent longevity inbuilt infrastructure must be overcome. Building infrastructure is expensive and the learning andcoordination that is associated with it is not easily replaced. The social context is ultimatelyresponsible for the investments made and the type of system expressed. <b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh’s</b> sanitationsystem reflects a historical legacy of colonial rule, decades of war, political chaos, and an influxof international aid contributing to an inefficient system being developed. The presence ofunpredictability and inflexibility in the system can result in an inefficient system being sustained...|$|R
5|$|From {{this point}} onwards Sihanouk was kept {{under house arrest}} at the royal palace. In September 1978 he was removed to another {{apartment}} in Phnom Penh's suburbs, where he lived {{until the end of}} the year. Throughout his confinement, Sihanouk made several unsuccessful requests to the Angkar to travel overseas. On New Year's Day of 1979, Sihanouk was taken from <b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh</b> to Sisophon, where they stayed for three days until 5January, when they were taken back to <b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh.</b> Sihanouk was taken to meet Pol Pot, who briefed him on the Angkar's plans to repulse Vietnamese troops, which had since invaded parts of eastern Cambodia in December 1978. On 6January 1979, Sihanouk flew to Beijing from <b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh,</b> where he was greeted by Zhou Enlai's successor, Deng Xiaoping. Three days later, Sihanouk flew from Beijing to New York to attend the UN Security Council, where he simultaneously condemned the Khmer Rouge for orchestrating the Cambodian genocide as well as the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. Sihanouk subsequently sought asylum in China after making two unsuccessful asylum applications with the US and France.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic Khmers have a poor {{perception}} of the Vietnamese community, due to persistent feelings of communal animosity from the past history of Vietnamese rule over Cambodia. In 1958, a survey conducted by Donald Willmott upon {{high school students in}} <b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh</b> showed that relations with Chinese were generally rated as friendly, whereas Khmer students viewed their Vietnamese classmates with suspicion. Relations between the Vietnamese and Chinese are considerably better, as both ethnic groups share a close cultural affinity. Chinese males sometimes take Vietnamese wives, particularly in <b>Phnom</b> <b>Penh</b> and eastern parts of the country where there are large Chinese and Vietnamese communities. In recent years, field research carried out by Ehrentraut in 2013 suggested that ethnic relations between Vietnamese have deteriorated not only with the ethnic Khmer, but also with the Cham and Chinese Cambodians.|$|E

In April 2014, the CRPP's registration was officially approved by the Interior Ministry. A month later, CRPP appointed a new chief-of-cabinet Nop Sothearith, and the party also made an in-advance registration with the Interior Ministry to run for general elections scheduled to be held in 2018.
