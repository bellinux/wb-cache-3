30|$|The {{study area}} lies in NWO Canada, where the Atikokan Generating Station (AGS) has been {{converted}} from coal to biomass (wood <b>pellet)</b> <b>feedstock</b> (OPG 2012). NWO has {{a vast amount of}} forest based woody biomass which can sustainably supply biomass feedstock to recently converted powerplant. Although AGS plans to use the combustion process for energy generation, our study uses different scenarios where biomass feedstock is converted into bio-oil, syngas and biochar using the normally available slow-pyrolysis machine in order to illustrate the cost assessment of biochar-based bioenergy production. The input-output data for the system boundary and unit processes were obtained directly from published literature, the NWO regional forest management units, forest management plans, and personal communications with harvesters, transporters and other professionals.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{renewable}} forms of energy, such as bioenergy produced from wood pellets, {{can serve to}} offset fossil fuel use and, hence, reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union is the world's largest user of wood pellets and British Columbia {{has been one of}} its largest external suppliers. British Columbia is currently grappling with the largest mountain pine beetle outbreak in its history. While this outbreak is expected to decrease the future timber supply in the Province, {{it has been suggested that}} one potential benefit of the mountain pine beetle outbreak is that it may provide a large amount of biomass that can be used for bioenergy production. Here we evaluate estimates of the amount of biomass available for bioenergy production in British Columbia and quantify the effects of the mountain pine beetle infestation on wood <b>pellet</b> <b>feedstock</b> supply chains. Our results, though subject to significant uncertainties, suggest that mountain pine beetle-killed wood is unlikely to be a substantial constituent of wood pellet feedstocks unless substantial subsidies are provided to offset higher harvesting costs. Even if such subsidies are implemented, it is likely that harvest residues will constitute an increasing proportion of wood pellet feedstocks as the volume of beetle-killed wood becomes depleted. Therefore, it is imperative that wood pellet producers improve the cost efficiency of harvest residue collection if they are to remain competitive in the European marketplace...|$|E
40|$|Biomass is an {{important}} energy carrier since it is a renewable source and the energy content in the fuel can be stored over time and also generate high temperatures. Bioenergy can be in liquid form, gas-phase or solid. The most common phase is as a solid. Before use, the biomass needs harvesting and refining. Pelletization {{is one of the}} most promising solid fuel qualities with a wide range of benefits which are needed before the product can enter the market and compete with more traditional sources of energy like heating oil and electricity. Despite its benefits, the pellet market still requires development. Several barriers need to be lifted such as understanding the market behavior, finding how bioenergy systems are adapted and what the level of technology is. <b>Pellet</b> <b>feedstock</b> is normally bi-products from sawmills, but increasing demand makes other feedstock alternatives interesting. Pulpwood from pine, straw and husk from agriculture and residue from the furniture industry are examples of new types of feedstock for pellet production. Different feedstocks can bring challenges due to the mechanical properties of the pellet fuel. Also chemical properties can be demanding if the inorganic content in the feedstock is high. The main objectives of the present work are divided into three selected areas; small scale pellets users in Norway, pretreatment of pure feedstock from pine and manufacturing of low-grade feedstock pellets with additives. The following research questions were settled for the work: 1) Which factors lead single household owners to choose wood pellet stoves compared to heat pump solutions and direct electrically heated systems? 2) How will existing users of wood pellets stoves choose if they should have any new system? 3) What is the practical experience of existing wood pellet stove users with aspects like the technical properties of fuel, stove or stakeholders? 4) How does extended storage of pine feedstock affect the mechanical pellet quality? 5) How does high and low temperature drying of pine feedstock affect the mechanical pellet quality? 6) How is the mechanical quality properties of pellets affected by the use of different selected additives? 7) Is the low-grade feedstock pellets made with additives combustible in ordinary grate furnaces/boilers? 8) How are the ash melting properties of difficult fuels affected by the use of selected additives? The research questions are aimed to solve by investigation of market penetration of wood pellet stoves through a survey. Further new pellet feedstocks like pulpwood, agricultural and furniture residues have been produced and tested. Also mixtures with different additives have been produced. The purpose of additives is mechanical fuel quality improvement and increasing the melting point of the ash in the fuel. Finally the new pellet fuel assortments were combusted and tested. All experiments and data collections performed this work is done in an industrial context. Chipping, grinding and pelletization were performed in ordinary industrial plants. Feedstock samples are collected from ordinary harvesting or side-product processes. Combustion is performed in ordinary furnaces/boilers. All processes mentioned above were set up with necessary measurement equipment. This way of experiment approaches have given good validity of the results from the experiments. The market investigation work was performed by a questionnaire among 188 random non-wood pellet users and 461 wood pellet users in Norway. The survey reached a response rate of 45 % from the existing wood pellet users. Factors that influence the decision of purchasing a heating system were identified like the age of the consumer, regional constraints in the availability of pellets and also that economic competitiveness is also weak compared to electrical heating. It was also found that pellet stoves need technical improvements to meet the end-user expectations. The ignition, control system, noise and imperfect combustion are examples of technical factors which need improvement. New pellet feedstocks need treatment prior to the pelletization process. Such process steps are chipping, grinding, storage, drying and possibly the use of additives. In this thesis, several feedstock assortments were manufactured. Pine pulp was stored outside for a year and dried at both high and low temperatures. The high temperature dried material and also stored material resulted in higher energy use for pelletization. There was lower energy consumption for fresh, low temperature dried material. Fresh material was found to have higher durability. Barley straw, barley husk and residue from furniture contain a larger amount of ash and a higher concentration of problematic ash-forming elements compared to conventional woody biomasses. This causes normally severe ash sintering and slagging which were observed in this study. Different raw feedstock were pelletized and combusted together with different additives. These additives might have multifunction such as: 1) improve the properties of fuel pellets from the mechanical point of view and 2) abate fuel ash slagging to achieve an efficient and smooth combustion process. In this work, each raw feedstock was pelletized with different additives in various additive-to-fuel ratios. The influence of additive addition on the pellet production process (i. e., power consumption) and pellet properties (i. e., bulk density, durability and particle density) were investigated. For furniture residue, both sewage sludge and marble sludge improved the durability of the pellets. But when there was a high content of marble, the durability was reduced and the levels of fines increased. Barley straw and barley husk durability were also improved with the lignosulfonate additive. With the marble sludge additive the barley husk durability was increased. Opposite barley straw durability was lowered with marble sludge additive. With combinations of both additives, the positive effect of marble sludge additive for both the barley straw and barley husk was to some extent eliminated. There are significant differences between the composition and ash chemistry of the formed slags. The slag from wood wastes was dominated by K, Na, Si and Ca, which were completely melted and fused into large blocks. The results from the chemical composition analyses of slag samples suggest intensive formation and fusion of low temperature melting alkali silicates. For the barley straw and barley husk that are rich in Si, K, P and Ca, most of the K reacts with both P and Si in ash residues and forms ash melts containing low temperature melting potassium silicates and phosphates. The ash melts were not transported from the grate area in the furnace and gives thereby initiated and enhanced ash slagging which reduces the operation stability of the furnace. Lignosulfonate, marble sludge and sewage sludge are proposed as additives to mitigate ash slagging during the combustion of the studied fuels. Marble sludge served as the most efficient additive to eliminate ash slagging during the combustion of pelletized barley straw, barley husk and wood wastes, respectively. The addition of marble sludge led to the formation of high temperature melting calcium-rich alkali silicates and/or phosphates. This process was accompanied by a significant reduction in ash melts and slag formation. A less pronounced anti-slagging effect was observed from the combustion of lignosulfonate added to barley straw and barley husk pellets. However, the addition of lignosulfonate altered the ash chemistry and promoted the formation of high temperature melting potassium calcium phosphates in ash residues. As result of this, the fraction of ingoing fuel ash that forms slag decreased, and the slags had smaller size and a lower degree of sintering. The addition of sewage sludge slightly reduced the slag formation during the combustion of wood waste pellets. This occurred because sewage sludge contributed to the formation of high temperature melting alkali aluminum silicates. PhD i energi- og prosessteknikkPhD in Energy and Process Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|Small size (1 MW) {{thermochemical}} plants producing {{electricity and}} heat are a convenient option for biomass-to-energy scenarios. It is required to improve these systems in terms of efficiency and flexibility, extending the feedstock specification and plant reliability. In this work the experimental results of the recent campaigns in the CRIBE gasification plant with out-of-specification <b>feedstocks</b> (<b>pellets,</b> vine prunings, rice husks, corn cobs, miscanthus) are described and discussed. The biomass properties are investigated and related to the technological operations and plant performance for defining the suitable ranges of their characteristics. The morphological parameters (size/shape), density, thermal and mechanical consistency of the material are crucial for the safe operation in the downdraft gasifier. The pretreaments (drying, size reduction, pelletization, mixing of different feedstocks) are necessary for operability and should be optimized considering the overall plant efficiency and costs. This will be evaluated with a process study...|$|R
40|$|Compost {{derived from}} swine solid {{fraction}} {{is a low}} density material (bulk density less than 500 kg m- 3). This makes it costly to transport from production sites to areas where it could be effectively utilized for value-added applications such as in soil fertilization. Densification is one possible way to enhance the storage and transportation of the compost. This study therefore investigates the effect of pressure (20 - 110 MPa) and pressure application time (5 - 120 s) on the compaction characteristics of compost derived from swine solid fraction. Two different types of material have been used: composted swine solid fraction derived from mechanical separation and compost obtained by mixing the first material with wood chips. Results obtained showed that both the pressure applied and the pressure application time significantly affect {{the density of the}} compacted samples; while the specific compression energy is significantly affected only by the pressure. Best predictor equations were developed to predict compact density and the specific compression energy required by the densification process.

40|$|The {{excessive}} {{amount of}} pig slurry spread on soil {{has contributed to}} nitrate water pollution both in surface and in ground waters, especially in areas classified as vulnerable zones to nitrate in accordance with European Regulation (91 / 676 /CEE). Several techniques {{have been developed to}} manage livestock slurries as cheaply and conveniently as possible and to reduce potential risks of environmental pollution. Among these techniques, solid-liquid separation of slurry is a common practice in Italy. The liquid fraction can be used for irrigation and the solid fraction, after aerobic stabilization, produces an organic compost rich in humic substances. However, compost derived from swine solid fraction is a low density material (bulk density less than 500 kgm– 3). This makes it costly to transport composted swine solid fraction from production sites to areas where it could be effectively utilized for value-added applications such as in soil fertilization. Densification is one possible way to enhance the storage and transportation of the compost.

40|$|Biomass is an {{important}} source of energy and the most important fuel worldwide after coal, oil and natural gas. Biomass does not add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere as it absorbs the same amount of carbon in growing as it releases when consumed as a fuel. Its advantage is that {{it can be used to}} generate electricity with the same equipment or power plants that are now burning fossil fuels. However, the low energy density of the biomass requires developments and advances in conversion technologies in order to increase process efficiency and reduce pollution. One of the most promising converting methods for treatment of biomass and waste feedstock is gasification. In this study a highly preheated air/steam of temperatures > 800 oC is introduced to the gasifier which is fed with wood pellets’ feeding rate 40 - 50 kg/h. The system is redesigned to work as a continuous type updraft HTAG. The aim of the studies was to test the performance of an Updraft configuration in various operating conditions using Biomass (wood <b>pellets)</b> as the <b>feedstock,</b> and facing primarily technological difficulties and process limitations. Determining the Temperature distribution along the reactor and synthesis gas composition of the process are reported for various operating parameters. During the experiment it is observed that the introduction of more steam flow rate increases the LHV (lower heating value) of the synthesis gases. Three case studies (Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3) are conducted, each case having different biomass feeding rate, steam flow rate and process air flow rate. The result show that the amount of LHV of gas varied from 3 to 4. 2 MJ/Nm 3, the H 2 : CO ratio is between 0. 5 - 0. 9 and the CO/CO 2 ratio has range 1. 0 - 1. 7.   Case 3, in which 40 kg/h biomass feeding rate and 80 kg/h Steam flow rate is maintained gives High LHV, high H 2 /CO ratio and more CO/CO 2 ratio among the rest case studies. Further improvement can be done within the reactor, increase in retention time and variation of more parameters can examine, in order to get the optimum result in future...|$|R
40|$|Densification {{of biomass}} is often {{necessary}} {{to combat the}} negative storage and handling characteristics of these low bulk density materials. A consistent, high-quality densified product is strongly desired, but not always delivered. Within the context of pelleting and briquetting, binding agents are commonly added to comminuted biomass feedstocks {{to improve the quality}} of the resulting pellets or briquettes. Many feedstocks naturally possess such binding agents; however, they may not be abundant enough or available in a form or state to significantly contribute to product binding. Also, process parameters (pressure and temperature) and material variables (particle size and moisture content) can be adjusted {{to improve the quality of}} the final densified product. Densification of ground biomass materials is still not a science, as much work is still required to fully understand how the chemical composition and physical properties, along with the process variables, impact product quality. Generating densification and compression data, along with physical and mechanical properties of a variety of biomass materials will allow for a deeper understanding of the densification process. This in turn will result in the design of more efficient densification equipment, thus improving the feasibility of using biomass for chemical and energy production. Experiments were carried out wherein process (pressure and temperature) and material (particle size and moisture content) variables were studied for their effect on the densification process (compression and relaxation characteristics) and the physical quality of the resulting products (<b>pellets).</b> Two <b>feedstocks</b> were selected for the investigation; namely, poplar wood and wheat straw, two prominent Canadian biomass resources. Steam explosion pretreatment was also investigated as a potential method of improving the densification characteristics and binding capacity of the two biomass feedstocks. Compression/densification and relaxation testing was conducted in a closed-end cylindrical die at loads of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 N (31. 6, 63. 2, 94. 7, and 126. 3 MPa) and die temperatures of 70 and 100 °C. The raw poplar and wheat straw were first ground through a hammer mill fitted with 0. 8 and 3. 2 mm screens, while the particle size of the pretreated poplar and wheat straw was not adjusted. The four feedstocks (2 raw and 2 pretreated) were also conditioned to moisture contents of 9 and 15 % wb prior to densification. Previously developed empirical compression models fitted to the data elucidated that along with particle rearrangement and deformation, additional compression mechanisms were present during compression. Also, the compressibility and asymptotic modulus of the biomass grinds were increased by increasing the die temperature and decreasing product moisture content. While particle size did not have a significant effect on the compressibility, reducing it increased the resultant asymptotic modulus value. Steam explosion pretreatment served to decrease the compressibility and asymptotic modulus of the grinds. In terms of physical quality of the resulting product, increasing the applied load naturally increased the initial density of the pellets (immediately after removal from the die). Increasing the die temperature served to increase the initial pellet density, decrease the dimensional (diametral and longitudinal) expansion (after 14 days), and increase the tensile strength of the pellets. Decreasing the raw feedstock particle size allowed for the increase in initial pellet density, decrease in diametral expansion (no effect on longitudinal expansion), and increase in tensile strength of the pellets. Decreasing the moisture content of the feedstocks allowed for higher initial pellet densities, but also an increased dimensional expansion. The pretreated feedstocks generally had higher initial pellet densities than the raw grinds. Also, the pretreated feedstocks shrank in diameter and length, and had higher tensile strengths than the raw feedstocks. The high performance of the pretreated poplar and wheat straw (as compared to their raw counterparts) was attributed to the disruption of the lignocellulosic structure, and removal/hydrolysis of hemicellulose, during the steam pretreatment process which was verified by chemical and Fourier transform infrared analysis. As a result, a higher relative amount of lignin was present. Also, the removal/hydrolysis of hemicellulose would indicate that this lignin was more readily available for binding, thus producing superior pellets...|$|R
