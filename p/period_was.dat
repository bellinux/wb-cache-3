5|$|The strongest {{hurricane}} to hit {{the state}} during the time <b>period</b> <b>was</b> Hurricane Fran in 1996, which struck near Wilmington as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale; Hurricane Emily in 1993 brushed the Outer Banks also as a Category 3 hurricane.

Cyclones affected the state in each month of the hurricane season from June to November, primarily in September.|$|E
5|$|A major {{development}} of this <b>period</b> <b>was</b> the appearance of stellate (star-shaped) shrines in a few temples built of the traditional sandstone, such as the Trimurti Temple at Savadi, the Paramesvara Temple at Konnur and the Gauramma Temple at Hire Singgangutti. In all three cases, the shrine is a 16-pointed uninterrupted star, a ground-plan not found anywhere else in India and which entirely differentiates these temples from the 32-pointed interrupted star plans of bhumija shrines in northern India.|$|E
