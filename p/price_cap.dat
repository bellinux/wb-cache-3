5|$|As Energy Minister, Baird was {{entrusted}} with implementing the government's plan {{to sell off}} part of Ontario's Hydro One. A few months later, he became unexpectedly involved in two major and interrelated policy reversals. The Energy ministry came under intense media scrutiny in late 2002 after hydro rates increased significantly {{in many parts of}} the province. Critics argued that the Progressive Conservative government's price deregulation policy (implemented before Baird became Energy Minister) was responsible. Baird suggested that the rate increases resulted from an unusually hot summer. Rates remained high through the autumn, and the Eves government was forced to re-regulate the market in November by introducing a <b>price</b> <b>cap.</b> The government continued to support deregulation in principle, but maintained the cap for the remainder of its term in office. The second and more fundamental reversal occurred in late January 2003, when Premier Eves announced that Hydro One would remain under public control.|$|E

In March 2011, European concerns over {{the implications of the}} Fukushima nuclear disaster for their nuclear reactors reduced atomic power generation and increased coal thermal generation. This caused extra demand for CERs in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and CER prices exceeded $NZ25 a tonne, the effective <b>price</b> <b>cap</b> in the NZ ETS. NZ buyers switched from the more expensive CERS to cheaper NZUs which were traded at a record price of more than NZ$21 per tonne. In July 2011, concerns over the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis combined with the high volumes of CERS being issued caused international CER prices to fall to a range between 9 and 10 euros. NZU prices fell to $NZ16.|$|E

40|$|Although {{electricity}} markets 2 ̆ 7 march toward competition {{has not been}} a complete success, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (2 ̆ 2 FERC 2 ̆ 2) remains committed to easing wholesale {{electricity markets}} toward that goal. Indeed, FERC 2 ̆ 7 s Standard Market Design Notice of Proposed Rulemaking makes some headway: Locational marginal pricing, for example, will force load to internalize the congestion costs of its consumption and will signal the need for new transmission and generation. FERC, however, has embraced <b>price</b> <b>caps</b> in spot markets and, to make the markets work despite the <b>price</b> <b>caps,</b> has proposed a Resource Adequacy Requirement (2 ̆ 2 RAR 2 ̆ 2) to ensure that adequate generation exists to deliver electricity to load. If RAR achieves FERC 2 ̆ 7 s objective, it will stunt the growth of demand response, a necessary component of stable competition. Further, RAR will permit the perpetuation of the current price-cap regime, which distorts price signals. The claim that RAR together with <b>price</b> <b>caps</b> are only temporary measures to help put wholesale markets on surer footing seems misguided; until <b>price</b> <b>caps</b> are raised significantly above present levels, load-serving entities and load itself lack the incentive to invest in technologies necessary to make demand response a reality. If this were not enough to counsel against promulgating the PAR, the proposal is internally contradictory and, according to the relevant statutes, lies outside FERC 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction to implement or enforce. FERC should discard the RAR and current <b>price</b> <b>caps</b> and instead adopt a reformist program that will better allow scarcity spot prices to ensure generation adequacy...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses real options {{modeling}} {{to assess}} the impact of different climate change policy instruments on investment, profits and cumulative emissions in the electricity sector. Even though CO 2 <b>price</b> <b>caps</b> or "safety valves" have been suggested as methods to limit uncertainty emanating from fluctuating prices of CO 2 permits that would hurt the industry's profit and thereby also energy security, our analysis shows that <b>price</b> <b>caps</b> set at a too low level are detrimental to the adoption of e. g. modern biomass-fired capacity as a replacement for existing coal-fired power plants. We therefore conduct a series of experiments with different policy scenarios to analyze under which regime emissions are most effectively reduced. With respect to CO 2 price uncertainty, it turns out that even for moderately rising CO 2 prices, fluctuations frequently lead to investment into carbon capture and storage (CCS), while investment is often not triggered in the face of deterministic CO 2 prices.
