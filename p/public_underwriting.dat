40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{the notion of}} “event seizure” to better understand how mega-events, and the elites associated with them, take possession of host cities and societies—of development plans, funds and legislation—and impose their priorities on cities and citizens. It illustrates how event seizure plays out in the preparations for the Football World Cup 2018 in Russia, which is on course {{to become the most}} expensive World Cup ever with a total cost of about USD 20 billion. Drawing on government and FIFA documents, public statements from authorities and officials, and media coverage, the paper examines three different dimensions of event seizure. First, infrastructural seizure, where event-related infrastructure, particularly sports venues, crowd out infrastructure that serves wider urban needs. Second, financial seizure, where a close circle of political and business elites benefits from state funding, while the <b>public</b> <b>underwrites</b> cost overruns. Third and last, legal seizure, where the event introduces exceptional legislation, infringing citizen rights and compromising due oversight of event preparations...|$|R
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2009 Dr. John WilliamsPrevious research that attempted to evaluate Australian farmers’ decision-making in a high risk environment has often been inconclusive and contradictory. The risks associated with wheat production, marketing, and hedging/pricing are high in Australia due to irregular rainfall, distance from major markets, and difficulties with suitable hedging benchmarks. Much of the overseas research has limited value to Australia because of higher farming risks, deregulated markets, no price/ income protection policies, and no <b>public</b> <b>underwriting</b> of risks. There have been few in-depth studies that have examined relevant marketing methods and hedging strategies from a behavioural decision-making perspective in a deregulated market. In this research, the Fisher Exact Test (a variation of the Chi-square test) analysed five marketing strategies and six hedging/pricing methods used by wheat growers, across eighteen key management factors and seventeen risk attitude/adoption characteristics in NSW for the 2005 production year, with the results compared with South Australia and Victoria. The findings were then used to examine eight research questions relating to decision-making. Different management approaches by Australian wheat growers were found to affect marketing decision-making more than hedging decision-making which was more influenced by risk perception. Cash flow might be a greater contributing factor leading to emotional anxiety than either the marketing method or hedging strategy. Growers {{were more likely to}} perceive that knowledge of variable costs of production led to price risk management, and {{were also more likely to}} perceive that they target more realistic price levels when variable costs are known. Alternatively, price risk management was an incentive to lower variable costs of production. A wheat grower's farm size, debt, and farming experience influenced the choice of marketing method or hedging strategy, whilst age did not, while the impact of training was inconclusive. Regret and avoidance in decision-making was high for wheat growers. Rogers’ adoption criteria have some influence on decision-making. There was much evidence to support the application of the Kahneman and Tversky’s ‘certainty effect’ proposition to Australian wheat growers. Open Acces...|$|E

When underwriters charge less than expected, they do not trade-off IPO compensation with underpricing.

Upon concluding a brief autobiography written in the mid- 1970 s, he said: "I still believe schools can be made better places for kids {{than they are now}} and that the struggle to make them so is worthwhile " (1975 a, p. 166). Similarly, one of his early essays on students rights asserts that civil liberties do not stop at the schoolhouse door (Molnar, 1975 b). The sway of corporate authority, censorship and suppression of resistance within schools work in tandem and mean that academic freedom is at stake, a point to which I will return.

40|$|Governments support urban mass {{transport}} services worldwide {{under the guise}} of helping the poor and improving the environment. With more and more governments cash-strapped and facing budgetary shortfalls in other vital areas, the fiscal burdens of <b>underwriting</b> <b>public</b> transport have prompted some observers to question such rationales.

The heavy financial burdens that the poor sometime face in moving about the city and possible ways of reducing these impacts are discussed. Examples of keeping transit fares affordable while also ensuring reasonably cost-effective mass transport services are cited. Because public policy choices that shape mass transport services are informed by technical evaluations, this paper also examines conventional practices regarding how transport proposals are reviewed and assessed. It argues that moving toward a framework that focuses on enhancing accessibility rather than principally mobility would better represent the long-term impacts of capital investments while also promoting the interests of mobility-disadvantaged populations. ...|$|R
