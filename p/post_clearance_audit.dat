40|$|A {{comprehensive}} database {{on domestic}} support is key for any meaningful agri-food policy {{computable general equilibrium}} (CGE) analysis. In the GTAP database – the main data source used for global CGE analysis – domestic support levels are calculated from the OECD Producer Support Estimate (PSE).

The quality of a riveted lap joint is characterized by sheet metal bulging, sheet material growth, residual stress level on sheets and rivets, and <b>post</b> riveting <b>clearance</b> in the joint. The quality of a formed rivet is often determined by the geometry of its head formation. This study is to determine the best riveting sequence for riveted lap joint in sheet metal assembly with 1 / 8 " nominal diameter of flat head tinner rivet on 0. 064 " thick aluminum sheet. The study is performed using finite element simulation of riveting process. Statistical design of experiment is employed to analyze the simulation data of riveting process along with the effect of individual factors, their interactions and relationship with the quality parameters of riveted lap joint in sheet metal assembly. A good combination of riveting process parameters is found that minimizes the residual stress in sheets and rivets, bulging and material growth in sheets and reduces the chance of <b>post</b> riveting <b>clearance</b> in riveted lap joint...|$|R

40|$|The Kouga Riparian Rehabilitation Project (KRRP) {{is seen as}} a pilot {{rehabilitation}} {{project in}} the Kouga region that is heavily invaded with Acacia mearnsii along the riparian zones of many mountain streams. Clearing of these black wattles and re-planting of indigenous vegetation are imperative to rehabilitation efforts. In this context, two invaded catchments were identified - the Baviaans and the Heuningnes. The aim of this research is to characterise the effects that the woody alien invasive Acacia mearnsii has had on the river channel morphology of the Baviaans and Heuningnes Rivers. A desktop and initial field analysis of the relevant study area catchments was completed. This was followed by a comparison of the channel morphology of the various study channel reaches using fixed channel transects. Ecological resource quality objectives (RQOs) for river rehabilitation from a fluvial geomorphological viewpoint were then established. A long-term monitoring protocol to assess whether or not these RQOs will be achieved was recommended. Follow-up channel transects were measured <b>post</b> wattle <b>clearance</b> in the Baviaans and short-term (< 2 yrs) changes in channel form were described. Differences in terms of the effect of Acacia mearnsii on channel form were then interpreted by direct comparison and through statistical analysis.

40|$|Following violent conflict, the {{continued}} presence of landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) and other explosive remnants of war (ERW) pose {{a barrier to}} rebuilding livelihoods. Mine action (MA) or humanitarian demining {{by the international community}} removes explosive remnants of conflict to enable affected households and communities to safely return contaminated land to productive use. Informed by a realist approach to evaluation and using the livelihoods framework, this study undertaken in Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR) and the Kurdish Region of Iraq explored the outcomes of MA at the household level and the contextual factors which mediated the extent to which demined land was used and livelihood impacts sustained. The underlying assumption was that the transfer of decontaminated land to households would act as an incentive for households to use the land in ways which would have multiplier effects on other livelihood asset holdings but that access to these assets would be mediated by context. A mixed-methods design constituting a survey and qualitative interviews was selected for this study. The study was conducted in three phases. Phase 1 was undertaken in the Mines Advisory Group (MAG) program in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). Phase 2 was undertaken in MAG’s program in the Kurdish Region of Iraq. The National Regulatory Authority in Lao PDR provided the setting for Phase 3 of the study conducted first in Nong District and then in Paksong and Pek Districts. The qualitative component of the study explored the livelihood outcomes of mine action and contextual variables which mediated outcomes. A livelihood asset scale was developed and validated during this study. In the third phase the greatest reported change in access to assets was reported to be in human and physical assets. This was also reflected in the type of <b>post</b> <b>clearance</b> land use which was often for improved schools and community facilities. The qualitative data in each phase, but particularly in the first and second phases, suggested that demining also enabled program recipients to connect with important cultural symbols and rituals, contributing to building self-esteem and collective resilience. The qualitative data revealed that major factors influencing outcomes were: 1) household context and access to assets, 2) the environment, 3) organisational capacity and 4) institutional arrangements. In conclusion, the research makes a significant contribution in understanding how (MA) contributes to post-conflict recovery. It also made a significant contribution {{to the development of a}} livelihood asset scale which can be used to measure self-reported changes in household livelihood assets following a mine action intervention. The research has policy implications for MA in the sites of inquiry and of global relevance and suggests further avenues for research...|$|R

40|$|In New Zealand, {{under the}} {{national}} bTB eradication strategy, bovine tuberculosis (bTB) has had a sustained decrease in prevalence since its peak in 1994 at 1700 infected herds. With the success of control measures, recurrence of infection in cattle and deer herds that have previously tested to a clear status {{is a problem that}} has recently become more apparent. Uncontrolled movement of cattle and deer from these herds pose a risk to the bTB eradication strategy. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify herd-level risk factors for bTB recurrence. Data were collected from 356 New Zealand cattle and deer herds that met the following criteria: (1) a culture positive case of bTB had been identified on or after 1 June 2006 (the index bTB episode), (2) the herd status had been cleared by testing that was completed by 1 November 2010, and (3) the clear status was not achieved by destocking. The outcome of interest for this study was defined as detection of a subsequent bTB episode before the end date of the study, 5 May 2011, by routine tuberculin testing or by slaughter surveillance. Herds were censored if no further bTB episode occurred by 5 May 2011. A Cox proportional hazards model was developed to quantify the magnitude of a series of herd-level risk factors on the daily hazard of bTB recurrence. Disease control area was included in the model as a fixed effect to account for confounding. There was a positive relationship between the daily hazard of recurrence and: (a) the number of bTB episodes in a herd prior to the first episode (HR [hazard ratio] 3. 2 for two prior episodes, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 8. 5; HR 86. 7 for five prior episodes, 95 % CI 13. 8 - 580), (b) the presence of more than one bTB positive animal at the index bTB episode (HR 2. 3 : 95 % CI 1. 2 - 4. 3) and (c) the presence of one or more cleared test-positives at the final clearance test at the index episode. The proportional hazards assumption was violated for the latter variable so a time dependent covariate was introduced into the model to account for the variable effect of the presence of cleared test-positives at the final clearance test over time. The monthly hazard of recurrence during the first two years after clearance was significantly increased in herds with one or more test-positive animals at the final test (HR 2. 8 : 95 % CI 1. 2 - 6. 4), but this association was no longer significant more than two years after clearance (HR 1. 5 : 95 % CI 0. 6 - 3. 6). We conclude that the presence of unresolved infection in a herd is a contributor to further bTB episodes {{in the first two years}} after clearance. TBfree New Zealand is reviewing policies to increase the sensitivity of detecting residual infection before clearance and to intensify <b>post</b> <b>clearance</b> testing and movement tracking in herds with risk factors...|$|R
40|$|Rhododendron ponticum is an {{invasive}} non-native shrub {{that represents}} a significant threat to productive land use, biodiversity conservation in priority habitats and potentially other ecosystem services in Britain and Ireland. Management actions that reduce the spread and impacts of invasive species require knowledge of their ecological characteristics as well as best control methods. A series of glasshouse experiments was carried out to investigate the effect of microhabitat on R. ponticum germination and seedling survival rates. Light environment {{in the form of}} different shade treatments, watering regime and seedbed substrate were manipulated in a factorial design to test their effects and interactions. Short-growing moss, bare soil and sown lawn grass produced a combination of high germination and seedling survival rates, with much lower rates in tall growing moss, leaf litter and grassland turf. Periodic droughting had a large negative effect on R. ponticum seed germination, especially in the more exposed seedbed substrates. The presence of additional canopy shade above a vegetated ground layer was very detrimental to R. ponticum establishment and this effect was found to be due to a reduction in light quality (ratio of red to far red light) and not light quantity (photosynthetic photon flux density). The use of chemical control methods with herbicides, in particular glyphosate, dominates current practice in the removal of R. ponticum from invaded habitats. In order to optimize the efficacy of glyphosate, a series of experiments were designed to improve knowledge of the effect on glyphosate absorption and translocation, of its dose in combination with application at different times {{of the year in the}} field, and of foliar application and light level in the glasshouse. Glyphosate applied to the foliage of R. ponticum plants less than 1. 5 m in height, was most readily translocated when the plants were more metabolically active. Plants treated in August and May showed greater rates and extent of crown damage than those treated in November and February. 14 C-labelled glyphosate applied to the lower leaf surface of R. ponticum plants was rapidly absorbed over the first six hours with maximum absorption after three days. Translocation to other parts of the plant (measured as glyphosate concentration) was greatest to the stem adjacent to the treated leaves and then to the roots, concentrations were lower in untreated leaves over 30 days. Supplemental lighting did not increase the foliar absorption of the 14 C but did increase the amount translocated to the other parts of the plant. This study has brought a new understanding to the invasion dynamics of R. ponticum that can be used in identifying habitats vulnerable to invasion and in developing a <b>post</b> <b>clearance</b> management strategy for preventing reinvasion of sites. It has also brought a basic knowledge to glyphosate absorption and translocation patterns that could have profound implications in improving practical application techniques of invasive woody plant species...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the value of {{radionuclide}} esophageal transit time (RET) in prediction of the results of pneumatic dilation in patients with achalasia. Patients and methods: Thirty patients (13 males) with a mean age of 37 &#x 00 B 1; 15. 6 years (range 17 - 73 years) were included in the study. All patients were diagnosed to have idiopathic achalasia of the cardia and selected for pneumatic dilation. Each patient had three RET, two the same day of dilation (pre-and postdilation) and a third follow up one within three months of dilation (4 patients failed to come for follow up and were excluded). Results: Several parameters were derived from RET studies, T/ 50 : time required for 50 &#x 0025; of activity in the esophagus to be cleared, T/ 10 : time required for 90 &#x 0025; of activity in the esophagus to be cleared and percentage clearance at 10 min. These parameters were compared to response of dysphagia to dilation. It was evident that the higher the esophageal clearance postdilation, the better the outcome. When immediate <b>post</b> dilation <b>clearance</b> was 85 &#x 0025; or more the success rate was 83. 3 &#x 0025; whereas when it was 20 - 50 &#x 0025; the success rate was only 21. 4 &#x 0025;. No relation was found between T/ 50, T/ 10 and dysphagia response. Conclusion: RET appears to be a useful quantitative procedure in the assessment of pneumatic dilation outcome in achalasia patients...|$|R
30|$|Land use {{also affects}} the {{minimum amount of}} {{rainfall}} required to initiate surface runoff. The relationship between Aridity Index and surface runoff (Fig.  8) indicates {{that the impact of}} LULC change on surface runoff is more pronounced in areas of high aridity. Long-term analysis of runoff in semi-arid catchment of Lemon, a study region located in southwest Western Australia (Ruprecht and Schofield 1989), showed that the minimum rainfall to initiate runoff had shifted fundamentally due to land use change. Prior to forest clearing, approximately 700  mm of annual rainfall was required for commencement of streamflow while only 100  mm of annual rainfall was required for commencement of streamflow in <b>post</b> forest <b>clearance.</b> The regression curves of rainfall before and after deforestation were similar but shifted to accommodate the increased runoff. Similar trends were also documented by the same authors in 1991 for the Don catchment in southwest Western Australia, where a minimum of 739  mm of annual rainfall was required to initiate streamflow in the pre-clearing period while during the post clearing period, a minimum of 532  mm of annual rainfall was required. As observed by Hallema et al. (2016), the propagation of generated runoff depends on the ability of hillslope to retain and release water, which largely controls the hydrologic response {{over the course of a}} given rainfall event. Dunjó et al. (2004) observed that high rainfall intensity generated more runoff than similar amounts of precipitation at low intensity. It has further been noted by Allison et al. (1994) that high rainfall variability causes high variability in recharge. Scanlon et al. (2006) have reported up to three times greater groundwater recharge during periods of El Niño relative to periods dominated by La Niña.|$|R
40|$|Canonical {{autophagy}} pathways may be stimulated experimentally by {{a variety}} of means such as rapamycin treatment, endoplasmic reticulum stress or nutrient deprivation. Infection by obligate intracellular pathogens such as viruses, can serve either to trigger the induction of autophagy pathways or the suppression of autophagy within the host cell at various stages in viral biogenesis. Autophagy pathways therefore play a complex role in both anti-viral defense mechanisms and in pro-viral events, such as the promotion of viral replication and egress. In this study, a panel of salicylamide derivates and structurally associated analogues were screened for anti-viral activity against cytopathic bovine viral diarrhoea virus (cp-BVDV), a Flaviviridae pestivirus often employed as a surrogate model of HCV due to similarities in virion structural organisation. Mardin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cell monolayers were infected at MOI 1 with cp-BVDV. Following incubation with the virus for 6 h, cell monolayers were then washed and treated for 24 h and 72 h with media supplemented with each of the compounds. Viral <b>clearance</b> <b>post</b> drug treatment was quantified by immuno-fluorescence methods. Candidate drugs demonstrating anti-viral activity were identified from the panel.

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Renal artery aneurism are a rare condition, with a {{prevalence}} of 0. 09 % of the population. The outcomes and clinical management of this patients {{depend on the}} presence of symptoms and subsequent risk of rupture. Most patients are managed by endovascular techniques, but difficult cases may present a challenge to urologists. METHODS: We present a case of a 35 year old female, history of high blood pressure with the diagnosis of a left renal artery aneurism with a diameter of 27 mm. The patient was evaluated by vascular surgery, was unsuitable for endovascular treatment and was submitted to a laparoscopic left nephrectomy with correction of the aneurism ex-vivo and the kidney was transplanted to the left iliac region. RESULTS: Operative time was 150 minutes and the warm ischemia time was 160 seconds. Blood loss was estimated in 80 mL with a hematocrit drop of 2 % post operative. Drainage and vesical catheter were removed at day 2 and 6 post-operative, respectively. <b>Post</b> operative creatinine <b>clearance</b> was comparable to the pre operative (Post - 95 vs. Pre - 98 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2) The follow up is 15 months and the patients has a functioning kidney and had a normalization of the blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: In experienced centers, laparoscopic nephrectomy with subsequent autotransplantion can be a safe and effective option in the management of specific conditions.

40|$|Hypothesis and Objectives PEGylated {{liposomal}} blood pool contrast agents maintain {{contrast enhancement}} over several hours. This study aimed to evaluate (long-term) imaging of pulmonary arteries, comparing conventional iodinated contrast with a liposomal blood pool contrast agent. Secondly, visualization of the (real-time) therapeutic effects of tissue-Plasminogen Activator (t-PA) on pulmonary embolism (PE) was attempted. Materials and Methods Six rabbits (approximate 4 kg weight) had autologous blood clots injected through the superior vena cava. Imaging was performed using conventional contrast (iohexol, 350 mg I/ml, GE HealthCare, Princeton, NJ) at {{a dose of}} 1400 mgI per animal and after wash-out, animals were imaged using an iodinated liposomal blood pool agent (88 mg I/mL, dose 900 mgI/animal). Subsequently, five animals were injected with 2 mg t-PA and imaging continued for up to 4 ½ hours. Results Both contrast agents identified PE in the pulmonary trunk and main pulmonary arteries in all rabbits. Liposomal blood pool agent yielded uniform enhancement, which remained relatively constant throughout the experiments. Conventional agents exhibited non uniform opacification and rapid <b>clearance</b> <b>post</b> injection. Three out of six rabbits had mistimed bolus injections, requiring repeat injections. Following t-PA, Pulmonary embolus volume (central to segmental) decreased in four of five treated rabbits (range 10 – 57 %, mean 42 %). One animal showed no response to t-PA. Conclusions Liposomal blood pool agents effectively identified acute PE without need for re-injection. PE resolution following t-PA was quantifiable over several hours.

40|$|Magister Psychologiae - MPsychSubstance abuse {{has been}} {{identified}} internationally and in South Africa as an escalating problem that has harmful effects on the substance user and on society. The cost of treating substance-related disorders places a strain on the allocation of financial resources to treat the problem. When relapse occurs in substance users who have already undergone rehabilitation, it increases the costs of treatment. Waiting lists at treatment centres are also negatively affected for first-time admissions when relapsed substance users are re-admitted. The study aimed to identify relapse indicators by post-discharge follow-up of adult substance users in a registered, non-profit, state-subsidised treatment facility in Cape Town. Marlatt’s Dynamic model of relapse was used to explore the individual and socio-cultural factors which were potentially associated with relapse. A quantitative research design using archival data and purposive sampling was used to identify possible relapse indicators. The participants were ex-patients who had undergone an inpatient treatment programme and who had been followed up <b>post</b> discharge. Ethical <b>clearance</b> {{was obtained from the}} University of the Western Cape Higher Degrees Committee. Written permission was granted by the treatment centre who is the original data owner.

40|$|Background: Biliary atresia (BA) is a {{progressive}} obstructive cholangiopathy of unknown aetiology, occurring during the perinatal period. If left untreated it rapidly progresses to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, with death occurring within 2 years. It {{is the leading}} cause of end-stage liver disease in the paediatric population and remains the most common indication for paediatric liver transplantation in South Africa. Objectives: Despite a wealth of information from developed countries, very little information is available in Africa and other developing nations. This study aimed to describe the age of presentation, clinical course and outcome of infants presenting to Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital (RCWMCH) with BA. Methods: A retrospective folder review was conducted on all patients with BA presenting to RCWMCH between January 2003 and December 2013. The main outcomes assessed were median time to presentation to tertiary services, <b>clearance</b> of jaundice <b>post</b> Kasai procedure (bilirubin < 20 μmol/L) and 2 - and 5 -year overall survival (OS) and survival with native liver (SNL). Results: The median age at presentation in the 80 cases reviewed was 70 days. Kasai procedure (KP) was performed in 62 (77. 5 %) patients at a median age of 68 days. 18 patients who presented late did not undergo KP. Clearance of jaundice was achieved in 39 % of KPs. 13 patients underwent KP beyond 90 days with a success rate of 38 %. 2 - and 5 -year SNL rates were 41 % and 37. 5 % respectively with OS of 59 % at 2 -years and 56 % at 5 -years. Liver transplant was only performed in 12 of the 54 patients who showed progression to require transplantation. Conclusions: Jaundice <b>clearance</b> <b>post</b> KP and SNL compared favourably with international figures, however, lower overall survival rates reflected lack of access to transplantation.

Previously, we have reported that BAI 1 (Brain Angiogenesis Inhibitor 1) binds bacterial Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and facilitates engulfment of Gram-negative bacteria by activating ELMO 1 (Engulfment and cell motility protein 1). Using Salmonella as a model organism, we hypothesized that ELMO 1 regulates bacterial clearance, activates autophagy and modulates the endosomal lysosomal pathway. The data from Salmonella infection in J 774 murine macrophages with depleted ELMO 1 expression, by genetic modification, suggest that ELMO 1 is important for LC 3 BII accumulation. There was a compounded decrease in LC 3 BII accumulation when ELMO 1 and ATG- 5 were simultaneously inhibited. These observations suggest that ELMO 1 is upstream of ATG- 5 and important for its function. The effect of ULK- 1 depleted macrophages on LC 3 BII accumulation was insignificant when compared to control macrophages. Therefore, it appears that Salmonella is cleared mostly by LC 3 -associated phagocytosis in an ELMO 1 -dependent manner. ELMO 1 -depleted macrophages showed delayed bacterial <b>clearance</b> <b>post</b> infection. ELMO 1 was found to interact with the late endosomal protein Rab 9, which is involved in lysosome biogenesis and cellular trafficking. The accumulation of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B varried in a time-dependent manner and decreased in ELMO 1 -depleted macrophages compared to control macrophages 12 h post infection. The expression of genes associated with the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island- 2 (SPI- 2), important for bacterial survival inside macrophages, decreased in ELMO 1 -depleted macrophages compared to control macrophages at 6 hours post infection. The understanding of the host response to enteric infections is important because they persistently reoccur...|$|R
40|$|Tick-borne {{encephalitis}} virus (TBEV) circulates {{mainly in}} the Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes persulcatus tick species, which serve both as hosts and vectors for the virus. Wild rodents are considered as bridges for non-viremic transmission between the ticks, {{which is the most}} important maintenance factor for TBEV. Secondary hosts support TBEV circulation as bloodmeal sources for ticks. The fragile maintenance cycle of the virus is affected by climates and availability of biotic factors thus, TBEV is found only in restricted foci by the Baltic Sea and the biggest lakes in Finland. TBEV is transmitted to humans when bitten by an infected tick. Infection may lead to a clinical disease, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). The number of TBE cases has increased in Europe since the 1980 s. Disease manifestation ranges from mild flu-like illness to inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS), and is in some cases followed by severe quality-of-life impairing sequelae. The clinical picture varies according to the virus subtype, as well as the age and genetic background of the patient. Three subtypes of TBEV are known: European (TBEV-Eur), Siberia (TBEV-Sib) and Far-Eastern (TBEV-FE). TBEV-Eur is carried mainly by I. ricinus and the two latter subtypes by I. persulcatus. Finland lies in the mixing zone of the tick species as both of the main host tick species and two of the three TBEV subtypes, TBEV-Eur and TBEV-Sib, are endemic in Finland. The disease has been known in Åland islands since the 1950 s as Kumlinge disease. Also the south-western archipelago and the Lappeenranta region by Lake Saimaa waterway in South-Eastern Finland have been known to be endemic for decades. TBE is a notifiable disease in Finland. All laboratory diagnosed cases are reported to the Institute of Health and Welfare by the treating hospital district, often the one of the municipality of residence of the patient. In the present study we surveyed all human cases reported in Finland during 2007 - 2013 by the geographical place of infection. We also surveyed the diagnostic alertness for TBE in different hospital districts in Finland and among patients with neurological infections with unknown aetiology. The number of suspected patients with TBE doubled during the period of our survey from 563 to 1154. However, TBE was not significantly underdiagnosed among patients with neurological infections with unknown aetiology. Besides the previously known endemic areas, infections were reported in a wider region around Saimaa, in central Finland and at the coast of Gulf of Finland. The areas with repeated human TBE cases were found {{in the northern part of}} the west coast, north of 64 ° latitude. We studied further in more detail several geographical sites of human infections. In Simo, Finnish Lapland the major tick species was I. persulcatus, as is expected in the north, but it unexpectedly carried the TBEV-Eur subtype. Therefore, we suggest that tick species in the area is not preventative for establishment of any newly introduced TBEV-subtype. Also, the species distribution of small mammals at the geographical sites of human infections was studied. While Apodemus mice are considered the most important hosts for TBEV maintenance in the deciduous zone, the bank vole, Myodes glareolus was the dominant species in the sites studied in Finland. An exception was the island Isosaari in Helsinki, where the vole species was exclusively Microtus agrestis, the field vole. To further study the infection kinetics and persistence of TBEV in the natural host species in the boreal zone as well as to compare the TBEV subtypes, we infected colonized bank voles with strains representing each of the three known TBEV subtypes. All strains were infective and highly neurotropic. TBEV-RNA could be detected in the brain as long as 168 days <b>post</b> infection. <b>Clearance</b> of TBEV-RNA from the brain was significantly slower than from the other organs investigated. However, attempts to show infectivity in cell culture were not successful. TBEV-FE induced prolonged viremia, indicating that its kinetics in rodents may differ from that of the other two subtypes. Altogether, the study showed that bank voles can develop TBEV infection of the CNS with inflammation and other pathological findings comparable with encephalitis. However, clinical symptoms were seen only in a few individuals and thus bank voles can serve as resistant models for studies on tick-borne encephalitis. Persistence of viral RNA in the brain of animals with asymptomatic course of infection supported our findings in wild rodents: TBEV-RNA was detectable in the brain of bank voles and field voles in winter several months after tick-feeding season in both TBEV-Sib and TBEV-Eur endemic areas (Kokkola and Isosaari, respectively). It is unlikely, that the individuals would have survived until February and March having manifested symptoms or impaired functional abilities. Serological analyses on wild rodents and laboratory animals support the suggestion that rodents may serve as sentinels for TBEV endemicity. However, the detection method, target organ, trapping season, sentinel species, and ecological parameters of the trapping site should be considered carefully when interpreting the results...|$|R
