40|$|This doctrinal study {{demonstrates}} in {{what way}} the ‘Universal Applicability’ of Buddha Dhamma can {{be reflected in the}} intervention process in view of the contemporary situation of the Buddhist Mindfulness being integrated as a <b>psychotherapeutic</b> <b>technique.</b> In past few decades, the Western psychotherapists recognize Mindfulness as ‘the heart of Buddhist meditation’ and apply it as an impartial <b>psychotherapeutic</b> <b>technique</b> to serve their clients’ physical health and psychological wellness. As recorded in the Buddhist Pāli tradition, through practicing Mindfulness meditation, people are able to comprehend the ‘Universal Applicability’ of Buddha Dhamma, to realize three universal characteristics (lakkhanas) of sentient existence, namely impermanence (anicca), un-satisfactoriness (dukkha), and non-self (anatta), and eventually to liberate their mind from suffering. From studying the Buddhist teaching of Mindfulness embedded in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta and the Mahā-Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, the researcher develops this tenet, “the Buddhist Mindfulness could be an effective <b>psychotherapeutic</b> <b>technique</b> when it is practiced within the Buddhist context and supported by the theoretical foundation, and when the ‘Universal Applicability’ of the Buddha Dhamma is reflected in the therapeutic process ”. Applying the tenet to study the case, the ‘Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program’ (the MBSR) initiated by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, she finds three issues which makes her hesitated to agree with the Western psychotherapists’ integrating the Buddhist Mindfulness as a stand-alone <b>psychotherapeutic</b> <b>technique.</b> The first two issues are the way the psychotherapists interpreting and implementing the Buddhist Mindfulness as a stand-alone technique without the Buddhist context and isolated from the Buddhist theoretical foundation. Resulted from the first two issues, the third one is the ‘Universal Applicability’ of Buddha Dhamma has no way to reflect in the treatment process to help people liberating from suffering. After identifying these three issues, the researcher carries on to incorporate ideas of practicing Mindfulness suggested by the Pali Buddhist tradition, and collaborate with the Social Work Profession with applying transferrable skills of the ‘Experiential Learning’ techniques to design a pilot service—the Buddhist Mindfulness-Based Social Service Project (the BMBSS). The BMBSS, consists of (1) an Orientation Meeting, (2) the six-session Prerequisite Training (the PRT-BMBSS) and, (3) the twenty-six-session Buddhist Mindfulness-Based Social Service Program (the BMBSS), aims at demonstrating the way to support the ‘Practicing Facilitators’ and the ‘Practicing Novices’ to apply the Buddhist teaching of Mindfulness into their daily activities. Moreover, the researcher designs the BMBSS Project in the way to promote interdisciplinary collaboration between Buddhist communities and the Social Work Profession to exchange ideas to benefit their services. The Social Work Profession may benefit from the Buddhist teaching on ‘non-self’ to apply its intrinsic technique of the ‘use of self’ to serve the clients, when the Buddhist communities may learn from the Social Work Profession to bring the Buddhist teaching to serve the society at large. Furthermore, ideas on supporting inter-disciplinary collaboration generated from developing the BMBSS may transfer into promoting dialogues and networking between the Buddhist communities and other professions to integrate the ‘Universal Applicability’ of Buddha Dhamma to serve the needs of the Buddhists and non-Buddhists. published_or_final_versionBuddhist StudiesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Conceptual {{blending}} {{has been}} proposed {{as a model for}} a variety of cognitive phenomena, and has the potential to contribute to our theoretical understanding of psychopathology. For example, from the perspective of conceptual blending theory, delusions are the product of conceptual integration processes similar to those present in many normal cognitive functions; however, there is aberrant selection of an input space, resulting in blends with relations that would normally be regarded as unfounded. Similarly, chronic interpersonal difficulties can be viewed as the repetitive application of a particular input-space frame to the construction of blends. Future research could examine whether this framework can be applied more generally to other psychiatric disorders, and whether the explicit reconstruction and examination of conceptual integration networks can be useful as a <b>psychotherapeutic</b> <b>technique...</b>|$|E

40|$|Randomised {{controlled}} trials (RCTs) of psychotherapeutic interventions {{assume that}} specific techniques {{are used in}} treatments, which are responsible {{for changes in the}} client's symptoms. This assumption also holds true for meta-analyses, where evidence for specific interventions and techniques is compiled. However, it has also been argued that different treatments share important techniques and that an upcoming consensus about useful treatment strategies is leading to a greater integration of treatments. This makes assumptions about the effectiveness of specific interventions ingredients questionable if the shared (common) techniques are more often used in interventions than are the unique techniques. This study investigated the unique or shared techniques in RCTs of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP). <b>Psychotherapeutic</b> <b>techniques</b> were coded from 42 masked treatment descriptions of RCTs in the field of depression (1979 - 2010).

This is done through several theoretical perspectives and especially the perspective of frame theory. In order to illustrate the usefulness ofthe presented theoretical positions, examples ofthe use ofthis technique in psychotherapy are explored in the light ofthese theoretical perspectives. Some suggestions are then given on how therapists can improve their ability to use reframing. Finally, some epistemological, ontological and ethical issues involved with the use ofreframing are explored. In the concluding chapter the results ofthis study are summarized and discussed...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{purports to}} {{elaborate}} and address several issues which {{lie at the}} intersection of computational linguistics and psychology. The first issue addressed is that of the interaction between discourse and semantics by virtue of empirical linguistic and psychotherapeutic evidence. This paper then gives a formal account of the knowledge representation and reasoning processes involved in the construction of an XML knowledge base for use in the sematic analysis of psychotherapeutic transcripts. Computational methods for the automatic mark-up and inference of the psychotherapeutic phenomena under investigation are detailed in order to further develop intuitions behind a particular pragmatic theory of language known as the Metamodel. The work presented here ultimately aims to produce a sustainable system for the evaluation of the effectiveness of any given <b>psychotherapeutic</b> <b>technique.</b> The possibility exists for such a system to recognise successful therapeutic mechanisms and further still, to infer new ones, or suggest improvements, or offer novel explanations as to {{the success or failure of}} the therapy itself. The work discussed here stems from research in computational linguistics, psychotherapy, and philosophy. The corpus used is a culmination of client transcripts taken before, during, and after therapy. The particular therapeutic technique used here is known as the Metamodel (Bandler and Grinder, 1975). The Metamodel was originally proffered as a method of language analysis suitable for use by practitioners of any <b>psychotherapeutic</b> <b>technique.</b> It theorises that speech utterances are related to a clients deep structure through three primary mechanisms, namely generalisation, deletion, and distortion. Previous hand tagging of our data has proven support for such claims. It is our aim to automate the identification and reasoning process. The issues and processes involved in the automation of such tagging are discussed here. Architectural and philosophical issues relating syntax (or grammar), semantics (Larson and Segal, 1995), and pragmatics (Grice, 1989; Searle, 1969) are raised. Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp, 1981; Asher and Lascarides, 1995) is discussed and used here in order to infer discourse relations.

40|$|O artigo trata da noção das origens da Psicanálise não como uma invenção sui generis de Freud, mas antes como uma apropriação da idéia interpretativa, cuja essência, a interpretação, ele transformou em método.
