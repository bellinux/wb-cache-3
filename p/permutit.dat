40|$|Micromethods for the {{determination}} of arginine based {{on the use of}} the Sakaguchi reagent have been described (14). This reagent gives a strong color with glycocyamine, arginine, and other monosubstituted guanidine derivatives. In a previous communication (5) a method for {{the determination}} of glycocyamine was described based on the Sakaguchi reaction and the quantitative separation of glycocyamine from arginine by selective adsorption of the arginine on <b>permutit.</b> In the method outlined below the separated arginine is eluted from the <b>permutit</b> and determined independently...|$|E
40|$|In the two {{following}} communications (1, 2) {{evidence is}} presented that glycocyamine {{is a normal}} precursor of creatine in the animal body. These studies required a satisfactory micromethod for the determination of glycocyamine. The most reliable method described in the literature consists in adsorption on Lloyd’s reagent in acid solution, elution with baryta, removal of arginine from the eluate by repeated adsorption on <b>permutit,</b> and calorimetric determination of the remaining glycocyamine {{by means of the}} Sakaguchi reaction. There are only two substances which are common in biological fluids and which give an intense color in the Sakaguchi reaction. These are arginine and glycocyamine. This method was first introduced by Weber (3) and was modified by Bodansky (4) and by Davenport and Fisher (5). In our hands even the latest version of the method, that described by Davenport and Fisher, had the following shortcomings: it was laborious and time-consuming, the adsorption of the glycocyamine on the Lloyd’s reagent was incomplete, further losses of glycocyamine occurred in the repeated treatment with <b>permutit</b> (Davenport and Fisher report losing only 10 per cent in three adsorptions; with the <b>permutit</b> available to us we lost 80 per cent), and the color developed was unstable. Furthermore, the amount of glycocyamine lost on the <b>permutit</b> varied according to the amount of arginine present, the less arginine the greater the loss of glycocyamine. All these disadvantages have been removed in the method described below. It is the first method in which glycocyamine added to blood or urine can be determined quantitatively, even in concentration 8 as low a 8 0. 1 mg. per cent. 2 to 5 ml. are sufficient for an analysis. An indication of the speed and convenience of the method is that twenty to forty analyses can be carried through simultaneously in about 2 hours...|$|E
40|$|In the {{experiments}} described here the acetylcholine (ACh) {{content of the}} various tissues and blood has been ascertained {{in order to gain}} insight in the role of ACh in normal and adrenalectomized albino rats, by using anesthetics or convulsion inducing agents. The ACh content was assayed biologically on the sensitized rectus abdominis muscle of the frog. A high concentration of KCI showed increasing effect on the contraction of muscle and on the contrary, relaxation in low concentration. So the contraction of rectus muscle caused by ACh was affected by the existence of K ion in tissues extracts. However, the effect of K ion in tissues extracts and blood was perfectly eliminated by using <b>permutit...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristic}} {{red color}} produced when proline interacts with nin-hydrin in acidic solutions {{has recently been}} proposed {{for use in the}} quan-titative assay of this imino acid (1,Z). These methods could not, however, be applied directly to the estimation of proline in biological fluids, since other amino acids interfere to some extent and must be removed either by chromatography (1) or by destruction with nitrous acid (2). In the pres-ent method, which is a modification of the procedure of Chinard (l), the interfering basic amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and ornithine are re-moved by shaking the solutions with <b>Permutit.</b> Under these circum-stances, the method becomes entirely specific for proline when applied to protein hydrolysates, urine, or plasma. The reaction product of proline in this acidic ninhydrin reaction has been assumed to be the compound isolated by Grassmann and von Arnim (3, 4) from a neutral reaction mixture (1, 2). The distinctly different ab-sorption spectra of the acid (1) and neutral ninhydrin condensation prod-ucts (5) required elucidation. The acid condensation product has been isolated and appears to have properties of a tautomer of the compound formed in the neutral condensation (3, 4). EXPERIMENTAL Proline Method-The following procedure was developed for the de-termination of proline. The solutions (1 to 5 X lO+ M proline) were shaken with approximately one-tenth their weight of <b>Permutit</b> ’ for 5 min-utes. 5 ml. of this solution, 5 ml. of glacial acetic acid, and 5 ml. of nin-hydrin reagent 2 are heated in a water bath for 1 hour in test-tubes with plastic screw caps. The solutions are cooled to room temperature and extracted with 5 ml. of benzene by shaking them vigorously for 5 minutes...|$|E
40|$|Co-mixed {{cellulose}} acetate butyrate and <b>permutit</b> in a definite composition was prepared and coded as MRS- 2. The membrane potential was measured with uni-uni valent electrolyte, NaCl solutions using saturated calomel electrodes (SCEs). The effective fixed charge density of the membrane was determined by TMS method and it showed dependence on the porosity, charge on the membrane matrix, charge and size of permeating ions. Other important electrochemical parameters were calculated. Conductance-time data were generated for the kinetic study of the permeating ions in terms of membrane permeability, flow and flux parameters. Donnan membrane equilibrium condition was examined. Membrane adsorbability showed concave dependence with external electrolyte solution and convex type dependence was showed by swelling and conductance parameters. This membrane had no characteristic of anomalous osmosis, indicates {{that there is no}} water flooding will take place during membrane operation. ...|$|E
40|$|In our {{previous}} work, steam-exploded wheat straw {{has been used}} to produce microbial oil by solid-state fermentation for the purpose of exploring a potential oil resource for the production of biodiesel. After solid-state fermentation the oil content of the dry fermented mass was 10. 2 %. In the present work, this dry fermented mass was pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed reactor in order to convert the microbial oil to biodiesel. The maximum liquid product yield of 43. 2 % was obtained at the conditions of final temperature of 500 degrees C, heating rate of 40 degrees C/min and sweep gas flow rate of 40 cm(3) /min (N(2)). The liquid product was extracted with n-hexane and separated to n-hexane soluble fraction and n-hexane insoluble fraction. The two fractions were analyzed using GC/MS, respectively. The main compositions of n-hexane insoluble fraction were water, methanol, 1 -hydroxy- 2 -propanone, furfural and acetic acid. The main compounds of the n-hexane soluble fraction were n-hexadecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, 9 -octadecenoic acid methyl ester, phenol and 4 -methyl-phenol. The conversion rates of hexadecanoic acid methyl ester and 9 -octadecenoic acid methyl ester can be increased by pyrolysis with catalyst <b>permutit,</b> the former increased from 6. 3 to 30. 0 % and the latter increased from 4. 2 to 10. 3 % with a catalyst ratio of 20 % (w/w). It can be speculated that during pyrolysis, the fatty acid methyl esters were produced by transesterification of microbial oil with methanol which was another pyrolysis product of the fermented mass. This research found that the fatty acid methyl esters, which are used as biodiesel, can be produced by pyrolysis of the oleaginous materials for the first time, hence providing a potential way for the production of biodiesel by pyrolysis instead of the traditional processing of oil extraction and transesterification.

40|$|The blood {{level of}} Vitamin B(1) in 80 cases of various {{dermatologic}} disorders was defermined with thiochrome method using <b>permutit</b> and considering {{the value of}} the healthy individuals and the results of other investigators, the minimum limit was established on 6. 0 γ% and the following results were obtained: 1) In 17 cases of healthy individuals, the average of the blood level of total Vit. B(1) was 8. 34 γ%, and it presented lower value in summer rather compared with in autumm. The average of the blood level of Vit. B(1) in dermatologic disorders was 6. 51 γ%, i. e., 1. 83 γ% lower than in the healthy individuals. 2) Concerning eczema acutum, it showed normal value in erythematous and desquamatous stadium. but {{in the rest of the}} stadium most of them showed lower value, in eczema chronicum it also showed lower value in cases in which the course was prolonged. 3) In dermatitis acuta and Duhring's dermatitis, the blood level of Vit. B(1) decreased in cases in which excessive exsudation could be seen, pemphigus, Domian enanthem and pellagra showed obvious deficiency of Vit. B(1). Moreover, in most of the cases of erythematodes and psoriasis vulgaris showed Vit. B(1) deficiency, but in acne vulgaris, alopecia arezta, chloasma and erythema induratum Bazin showed normal value. 4) Vit. B(1) takes part in the metabolism with close relation with the functions of many organs, as well as with other Vitamins and endocrine system; so the variation of the blood level of Vit. B(1) might not be attributed as the only cause of the previous diseases, but it could be concluded that in some of the cases, the deficiency of Vit. B(1) takes an important roll in the cause or degeneration of dermatologic diseases...|$|E
40|$|The Principle of {{this method}} is {{hydrolysis}} of urea by urease, diffusion of produced ammonia into dilute sulfuric acid and colorimetric estimation of ammonia by the previously reported phenol-antiformine procedure. Preparation of urease solution according to Folin and Youngberg was slightly modified as follows. About 1 g. of <b>permutit</b> in a flask is washed once with 2 per cent acetic acid, then twice with water; 1 g. of jack bean or soya or soya bean meal and 20 ml. of M/ 50 phosphate buffer (pH 6. 8) are added to it. The mixture is shaken gently for 15 minutes, then centrifuged and the supernatant is used as urease solution. One ml. of such solution can split 1 micromole urea at 37 ℃ in 10 minutes. In the outer chamber of Conway 2 ̆ 7 s unit 0. 1 ml. of blood is mixed with 1 ml. of the buffered urease solution, and into the inner chamber of the unit 1 ml. of N/ 100 sulfuric acid is:pipetted. Then the unit is closed and left for 10 minutes at 37 ℃. Then 1 ml. of saturated potassium carbonate {{is added to the}} outer chamber and the closed unit is left in that condition for one hour at 37 ℃ in order to distillate the produced ammonia into the sulfuric acid in the inner chamber. The acid solution is then transferred by a 0. 2 ml. capillary pipette from the inner chamber to a test tube 2 ̆ 7 graduated at 10 ml., where after the inner chamber is washed thrice every time with 0. 5 ml. of water, the washings being transferred successively by the capillary pipette to the test tube. As a blank 0. 1 ml. of water is treated simultaneously in the same manner. The solution in the test tubes is now nearly 2. 5 ml [...] The indophenol reagents are added to them as reported previously and after 20 minutes the blue solution is filled with water to the mark. To measure the extinction coefficient of indophenol blue out of known ammonia quantity, add 1. 5 ml. of water, then the reagents to 1 ml. of M/ 1000 ammonium sulfate for standard and to 1 ml. of water as its blank respectively and dilute the solutions to the mark with water (Photometry by Pulfrich 2 ̆ 7 s apparatus.). The calculation of urea content in the tested blood is as follows. Blood urea mg. per 1. 00 ml. =E. of test blood-E. of its blank/E. of standard-E. of its blank× 60 mg. Similarly 0. 1 ml. of serum may be used in the determination of urea, as its concentration is the same in blood and serum...|$|E
