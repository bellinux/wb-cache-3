The co-precipitation leads to nanocrystallites of the order of 100-200 nm in size and their sensitivity as x-ray storage phosphors is increased an astounding ∼500,000 times because of the specific arrangements and density of defect centres in comparison with microcrystalline samples prepared by sintering at high temperature. The mechanism is based on the reduction of Sm to Sm by trapping electrons that are created upon exposure to ionizing radiation in the BaFCl host. The [...] D- F f-f luminescence lines can be very efficiently excited via the parity allowed 4f →4f 5d transition at around 417 nm.

The determination of the biological effects of these changes requires accurate and reliable UV monitoring systems that weight the spectral irradiance according to the biological responses under consideration.

40|$|Noise-related {{hearing loss}} has been listed {{as one of}} the most {{prevalent}} occupational health concerns in the United States for more than 25 years with approximately 30 million people in the US alone occupationally exposed to hazardous noise according to the Occupational Safety and Health Organization. Many people are aware of some risks the military members take every day being at war, but very few think about the risks of the members on a base located stateside. To this point, not much research has been done on these risks, and even less has been done on the hazardous noise risks these service members are subjected to. These workers typically work many days a week as well as long hours while being around loud noises for extended periods of time. The purpose of this research study was to collect data on personal noise exposure for security forces at multiple locations at MacDill Air Force Base (AFB) to compare the results with the Air Force Occupational and Environmental Exposure Limit (OEEL) of 85 dBA for an 8 -hour time weighted average (TWA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 90 dBA for an 8 -hour TWA. Personal noise dosimeters were used for collecting personal noise exposure, and sound level meters were used for collecting area noise exposure. A Lieutenant at MacDill offered the data she was at liberty to divulge on the security forces for this study. Dosimetry testing was done at four locations, and sound level surveys were done at two locations, with one of the locations being tested by both, dosimeters and a sound level meter. The results from this study show that the highest area noise is on the 26 ft Aluminum Boat at the helm with the sirens on while the boat moves at 25 knots with a noise level at 101. 2 dBA, and the highest personal noise exposure was at the CATM section with an 8 -hour TWA of 108. 9 dBA.

40|$|Nanocrystalline BaFCl:Sm 3 +, as {{prepared}} by co-precipitation from aqueous solutions, is an efficient photoluminescent storage phosphor for ionising radiation. It has potential applications in medical imaging and <b>personal</b> radiation monitoring (<b>dosimetry).</b> Upon X-ray, -ray or -irradiation, the Sm 3 + ions in BaFCl host {{are reduced to}} Sm 2 + ions which can be read out efficiently by measuring the narrow 5 DJ- 7 FJ f-f luminescence lines via excitation into the very intense, parity-allowed 4 f 6 - 4 f 55 d transition in the blue-violet region of the spectrum. This thesis focuses on investigations of the storage mechanism of the phosphor {{by a variety of}} spectroscopic techniques, such as synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, cathodoluminescence microanalysis, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy, high-resolution laser spectroscopy (e. g. spectral hole-burning) and electron spin resonance. The results are further compared with those obtained for microcrystalline BaFCl:Sm 3 + {{prepared by}} high-temperature sintering. Significant differences in the local coordination environment and spatial distribution of Sm 3 + ions between nanocrystalline and microcrystalline BaFCl:Sm 3 + are revealed by comparing the photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence spectra of the two samples before and after X-irradiation. For nanocrystalline BaFCl:Sm 3 +, the X-irradiation induced reduction of Sm 3 + to Sm 2 + ions and photoionisation of Sm 2 + to Sm 3 + ions during photobleaching are investigated by monitoring the photoluminescence intensities of both Sm 3 + and Sm 2 + ions in the two processes. Both processes can be modelled well by a formulation based on dispersive first-order kinetics. The photoionisation of Sm 2 + ions is also demonstrated in spectral hole-burning experiments of the X-irradiated nanocrystalline and microcrystalline BaFCl:Sm 3 +. It is found that non-Sm 3 + electronic traps are likely involved in the photoionisation process. In search for defect centres by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, oxygen defects are found to play an important part in the storage mechanism of the phosphor. In addition, some key aspects of the application of the phosphor in <b>personal</b> radiation <b>dosimetry</b> and medical imaging are evaluated.

Field surveys were conducted twice in the pharmacy where two workers were randomly selected and solicited to wear <b>personal</b> <b>dosimetry</b> instruments for a full-shift assessment of personal exposure. We used an EMDEX II for on site measurements and did not consider any specific instrument or equipment for health care services as potential sources of magnetic field.

Both inadequate consideration for the field survey of the temporal variability in magnetic flux densities over the workday and that the monitored workers spent almost half of the full-shift working in places outside of the study areas may have contributed to such discrepancy in results between field survey and <b>personal</b> <b>dosimetry.</b> This study suggests that the potential for elevated exposure to 60 Hz magnetic fields in health care settings does exist, and that using job title as a surrogate for magnetic fields exposure classification might entail certain degrees of misclassification.

The LAeq, {{assessed}} by <b>personal</b> noise <b>dosimetry,</b> {{has been used}} to study acute effects. Various indices of total noise exposure, involving level and duration, were developed for long-term effect studies. In the analysis close attention was paid to prevent confounding, e. g. by other adverse working conditions. As expected, hearing loss increased with total noise exposure. Tinnitus was related particularly to hearing loss. Dizziness and hoarseness, however, were not related with noise exposure in this study. Also no correlation could be demonstrated between blood pressure and total noise exposure after correction for age, relative weight and various confounding variables. Use of hearing protection, selection processes and incomplete analysis of interactions between independent variables are suggested for possible explanation. About two-thirds of the workers reported noise annoyance. Various aspects were mentioned, such as irritation, surprise and impairment of communication and perception. Mentally stressful tasks appeared to be the most noise-sensitive. Particularly annoying noise sources, mental work load and time pressure had a relatively large impact on noise annoyance in comparison with the influence of noise level (LAeq) itself. Stress responses were not simply related to the noise exposure level, although consistent positive relations could be demonstrated between symptoms of stress and noise annoyance. Various findings led to the conclusion that noise exposure together with stressful mental activities may lead to disturbed concentration, irritation and annoyance. Experienced stress in turn may render workers more susceptible to noise.

40|$|BackgroundNoise {{exposures}} {{are associated}} with a host of adverse health effects, yet these exposures remain inadequately characterized in many industrial operations, including paper mills. We assessed noise at four paper mills using three measures: 1) <b>personal</b> noise <b>dosimetry,</b> 2) area noise measurements, and 3) questionnaire items addressing several different aspects of perceived noise exposure. MethodsWe assessed exposures to noise characterized using the three measures and compared the relationships between them. We also estimated the validity of each of the three measures using a novel application of the Method of Triads, which {{does not appear to have}} been used previously in the occupational health literature. ResultsWe collected 209 valid dosimetry measurements and collected perceived noise exposure survey items from 170 workers, along with 100 area measurements. We identified exposures in excess of 85 dBA at all mills. The dosimetry and area noise measurements assigned to individual subjects generally showed good agreement, but for some operations within mill, large differences between the two measures were observed, and a substantial fraction of paired measures differed by > 5 dB. Perceived noise exposures varied greatly between the mills, particularly for an item related to difficulty speaking in noise. One perceived noise exposure item related to difficulty hearing due to noise showed strong and significant correlations with both dosimetry and area measurements. The Method of Triads analysis showed that dosimetry measures had the highest estimated validity coefficient (0. 70), and that the best performing perceived exposure measure had validity that exceeded that of area measurements (0. 48 vs. 0. 40, respectively). ConclusionsWorkers in Swedish pulp mills have the potential for exposures to high levels of noise. Our results suggest that, while dosimetry remains the preferred approach to exposure assessment, perceived noise exposures can be used to evaluate potential exposures to noise in epidemiological studies.

40|$|The {{presence}} of carbon atoms in silicon carbide and diamond makes the materials ideal candidates for direct fast neutron detectors. Furthermore the low atomic number, strong covalent bonds, high displacement energies, wide band gap and low intrinsic carrier concentrations make these semiconductor detectors potentially suitable for applications where rugged, high temperature, low gamma sensitivity detectors are required, such as Active Interrogation, Electronic <b>Personal</b> Neutron <b>Dosimetry</b> and Harsh Environment Detectors. A thorough direct performance {{comparison of the}} detection capabilities of semiinsulating silicon carbide (SiC-SI), single crystal diamond (D-SC), polycrystalline diamond (D-PC) and a self-biased epitaxial silicon carbide (SiC-EP) detector has been conducted and benchmarked against a commercial silicon PIN (Si-PIN) diode, {{in a wide range}} of alpha (Am- 241), beta (Sr/Y- 90), ionising photon (65 keV to 1332 keV) and neutron radiation fields (including 1. 2 MeV to 16. 5 MeV mono-energetic neutrons, as well as neutrons from AmBe and Cf- 252 sources). All detectors were shown to be able to directly detect and distinguish both the different radiation types and energies by using a simple energy threshold discrimination method. The SiC devices demonstrated the best neutron energy discrimination ratio (Emax[n= 5 MeV] / Emax[n= 1 MeV] 5), whereas a superior neutron/photon cross sensitivity ratio was observed in the D-PC detector (Emax[AmBe] / Emax[Co- 60] 16). Further work also demonstrated that the cross sensitivity ratios can be improved through use of a simple proton-recoil conversion layer. Stability issues were also observed in the D-SC, D-PC and SiC-SI detectors while under irradiation, that being a change of energy peak position and/or count rate with time (often referred to as polarisation effect). This phenomenon within the detectors was non-debilitating over the time period tested (> 5 h) and as such, stable operation was possible. Furthermore, the D-SC, self-biased SiC-EP and a semi-insulating SiC detector were shown to operate over the temperature range - 60 C to + 100 C...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} {{considerable}} progress in neutron dosimetry, {{there is no}} dosemeter {{that is capable of}} measuring neutron doses independently of the neutron spectrum with good accuracy. Carbon-doped aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3 :C) is a sensitive material for ionising radiation (beta-ray, X ray and electron) and has been used for applications in <b>personal</b> and medical <b>dosimetry</b> as an optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosemeter. Al 2 O 3 :C has a low sensitivity to neutron radiation; this prevents its application to neutron fields, representing a disadvantage of Al 2 O 3 :C-OSL when compared with LiF, which is used as a thermoluminescent detector. Recently an improvement for neutron dosimetry (Passmore and Kirr. Neutron response characterisation of an OSL neutron dosemeter. Radiat. Prot. Dosim. 2011; 144 : 155 - 60) uses Al 2 O 3 :C coated with (Li 2 CO 3) -Li- 6 (OSLN), which gives the high-sensitive response as known for Al 2 O 3 :C with the advantage of being also sensitive to thermal neutrons. In this article, the authors compare small-size detectors (droplets) of Al 2 O 3 :C (OSL) and of Al 2 O 3 :C + (Li 2 CO 3) -Li- 6 (OSLN) and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of both materials, regarding size vs. response...|$|R
