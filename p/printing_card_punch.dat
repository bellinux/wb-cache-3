50|$|The IBM 056 was the {{verifier}} {{companion to}} the 024 Card Punch and 026 <b>Printing</b> <b>Card</b> <b>Punch.</b> The verifier {{was similar to}} the 026 keypunch except for a red error lens in the machine cover lower center. The verifier operator entered exactly the same data as the keypunch operator and the verifier machine then checked to see if the punched data matched. Successfully verified cards had a small notch punched on the right hand edge.|$|E
5000|$|The IBM 024 Card Punch and IBM 026 <b>Printing</b> <b>Card</b> <b>Punch</b> [...] were {{announced}} in 1949. They were almost identical, {{with the exception}} of the printing mechanism. The heart of the 024 and 026 keypunches was a set of twelve precision punches, one per card row, each with an actuator of relatively high power. Punch cards were stepped across the punch one column at a time, and the appropriate punches were activated to create the holes, resulting in a distinctive [...] "chunk, chunk" [...] sound as columns were punched. Both machines could process 51-, 60-, 66-, and 80-column cards.|$|E
50|$|The 7090 series {{features}} a data channel architecture for input and output, a forerunner of modern {{direct memory access}} I/O. Up to eight data channels can be attached, with up to ten IBM 729 tape drives attached to each channel. The data channels have their own very limited set of operations called commands. These are used with tape (and later, disk) storage as well as card units and printers, and offered high performance for the time. <b>Printing</b> and <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> I/O, however, employed the same modified unit record equipment introduced with the 704 and was slow. It became common to use a less expensive IBM 1401 computer to read cards onto magnetic tape for transfer to the 7090/94. Output would be spooled onto tape and transferred to the 1401 for <b>printing</b> or <b>card</b> <b>punching</b> using its much faster peripherals, notably the IBM 1403 line printer. Later IBM introduced the 7094/7044 Direct Coupled System, using data channel to data channel communication, with the 7094 primarily performing computations and the 7044 performing I/O operations using its fast 1400-series peripherals.|$|R
50|$|As {{machines}} {{became more}} powerful {{the time to}} run programs diminished, and the time to hand off the equipment to the next user became large by comparison. Accounting for and paying for machine usage moved on from checking the wall clock to automatic logging by the computer. Run queues evolved from a literal queue {{of people at the}} door, to a heap of media on a jobs-waiting table, or batches of punch-cards stacked {{one on top of the}} other in the reader, until the machine itself was able to select and sequence which magnetic tape drives processed which tapes. Where program developers had originally had access to run their own jobs on the machine, they were supplanted by dedicated machine operators who looked after the machine and were less and less concerned with implementing tasks manually. When commercially available computer centers were faced with the implications of data lost through tampering or operational errors, equipment vendors were put under pressure to enhance the runtime libraries to prevent misuse of system resources. Automated monitoring was needed not just for CPU usage but for counting pages <b>printed,</b> <b>cards</b> <b>punched,</b> <b>cards</b> read, disk storage used and for signaling when operator intervention was required by jobs such as changing magnetic tapes and paper forms. Security features were added to operating systems to record audit trails of which programs were accessing which files and to prevent access to a production payroll file by an engineering program, for example.|$|R
50|$|As {{initially}} defined an ASP system {{consisted of}} a large System/360 computer, a Model 50, 65, or 75 running OS/360, called the main processor, and a smaller System/360, Model 40 or larger, called the support processor, running the ASP supervisor as a single task under OS/360 PCP (Primary Control Program). The support processor performed functions such as <b>printing,</b> <b>card</b> reading and <b>punching,</b> freeing the main processor to run the application workload. It queued jobs, roughly 30 in the basic configuration, and released them to the main processor in priority order, and also did pre-execution setup of removable input/output devices such as disks and tapes on the main processor.|$|R

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} text entry interfaces was the <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> input. A <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> input is a computer input device used to read executable computer programs, source code, and data from <b>punched</b> <b>cards.</b> Most early computers used <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> as their main input device. Along with a <b>card</b> <b>punch,</b> <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> readers were an earlier method of entering data and running programs before {{the current generation of}} input devices existed. A <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> is an output device that <b>punches</b> holes in <b>cards</b> under computer control.

50|$|Many {{organizations}} were loath to alter systems that were working, so production unit record installations remained in operation long after computers offered {{faster and more}} cost effective solutions. Specialized uses of <b>punched</b> <b>cards,</b> including toll collection, microform aperture <b>cards,</b> and <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> voting, kept unit record equipment in use into the twenty-first century. Another reason was cost or availability of equipment: for example in 1965 an IBM 1620 computer {{did not have a}} printer as standard equipment, so it was normal in such installations to <b>punch</b> <b>printed</b> output onto <b>cards,</b> using two cards per line if required and <b>print</b> these <b>cards</b> on an IBM 407 accounting machine and then throw the cards away.|$|R

50|$|The {{card reader}} could read 600 {{standard}} <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> per minute, {{each with a}} capacity of up to 80 characters. The <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> could <b>punch</b> 100 <b>cards</b> per minute.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> had {{a maximum}} rate of 150 cards per minute. Timing was quite {{critical}} throughout {{the operation of}} the <b>card</b> <b>punch,</b> the <b>card</b> reader and the printer, all being based on electromechanical principles. The basic <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> mechanism was manufactured by Bull, a French company which owned patents on 80 column <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> machines. The machine came in two versions, the P147 and the P67, the main difference being electromagnetic clutch or a solenoid operated mechanical [...] "dog" [...] clutch to initiate a punch cycle. Since many gears, electrical contact cams were affixed to the main shaft with taper pins, the P 67 with its severe stopping dog clutch would cause timing loss more frequently than the P 147. Most emergency maintenance time was spent replacing worn and damaged taper pins and retiming the machine. The <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> had a preread station, a punch station and a checkread station. The machine could be quite difficult to maintain and required much skill to troubleshoot and maintain. The machine cycle was oddly divided into 420 [...] "points" [...] or [...] "Bull degrees".|$|R
50|$|A lace <b>card</b> is a <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> {{with all}} holes punched (also called a whoopee card, {{ventilator}} card, flyswatter card, or IBM doily). They were mainly used as practical jokes to cause unwanted disruption in card readers. Card readers tended to jam when a lace card was inserted, as the resulting card had too little structural strength to avoid buckling inside the mechanism. <b>Card</b> <b>punches</b> could also jam trying to produce cards with all holes punched, owing to power-supply problems. When a lace card was fed through the reader, a card knife or card saw (a flat tool used with <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> readers and <b>card</b> <b>punches)</b> {{was needed to}} clear the jam.|$|R
50|$|Backing {{store was}} {{magnetic}} drum and optionally one-inch-, half-inch- or quarter-inch-wide magnetic tape. Input was from 80-column <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> and optionally 160-column <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> and <b>punched</b> paper tape. Output was to 80-column <b>punched</b> <b>cards,</b> line printer, and optionally to punched paper tape.|$|R

5000|$|The {{standard}} [...] "output" [...] {{mechanism for}} a program was to <b>punch</b> <b>cards,</b> which was faster than using the typewriter. These <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> were then fed through an IBM 407 mechanical calculator which could be programmed to <b>print</b> two <b>cards,</b> thus being {{able to use the}} additional print columns available on the 407. All output was synchronous, and the processor paused while the I/O device produced the output, so the typewriter output could completely dominate program running time.|$|R
