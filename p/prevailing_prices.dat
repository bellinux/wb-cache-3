In the 1970s most industrial ethanol in the United States was made as a petrochemical, but in the 1980s the United States introduced subsidies for corn based ethanol and today it is almost all made from that source.|$|E
25|$|Food access {{refers to}} the {{affordability}} and allocation of food, {{as well as the}} preferences of individuals and households. The UN Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights noted that the causes of hunger and malnutrition are often not a scarcity of food but an inability to access available food, usually due to poverty. Poverty can limit access to food, and can also increase how vulnerable an individual or household is to food price spikes. Access depends on whether the household has enough income to purchase food at <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices</b> or has sufficient land and other resources to grow its own food. Households with enough resources can overcome unstable harvests and local food shortages and maintain their access to food.|$|E
5000|$|In {{econometrics}} it {{is often}} desirable to have {{a model of the}} cost of production of a given output with given inputs - or in common terms, what it will cost to produce some number of goods at <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices,</b> or given <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices</b> and a budget, how much can be made.

50|$|Other {{unintended}} consequences of an FTT could include {{a reduction in}} professional market participants such as market makers who stand ready {{to buy or sell}} at <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices.</b> This could impact the orderly and efficient operation of markets, including the price discovery process.

50|$|At the {{cessation}} of armed hostilities in April 1865, the Coker family began rebuilding. Although Sherman's army had left no work stock, Major Coker had cotton seed and seed corn, which he planted {{with the use of}} an old mule and a pair of oxen borrowed from an uncle. He planted 60 acre of cotton and 40 acre of corn, which yielded 25 bales of cotton and 300 bushels of corn. At the <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices,</b> 25 bales of cotton brought $1,700, a small fortune in that time.|$|E
50|$|The above factors {{contributed to}} a {{speculative}} boom throughout the Territory, but particularly in Madison County, Alabama, where the prices increased from around $2 per acre in 1817 to $7.40 per acre by 1818, with reports of much higher prices ($78 per acre in one case) in certain locales. Cotton at this time cost around $0.15 per pound to produce, and when combined with <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices</b> at $0.30 per pound, implied annual profits of around $120 per acre. Such profits would justify even the highest per acre prices reported around Huntsville.|$|E

5000|$|For example, assume an {{industry}} {{with a certain}} capacity that produces a certain commodity.

The demand depends on the market price. The price in the market declines if supply exceeds demand, and it increases, if supply is less than demand. The price mechanism leads to market clearing in the short run.|$|R

The scheme cost Kentucky farmers an estimated $300,000. President Abraham Lincoln ordered the program halted after one month, because it was widely reviled in a state that was at best a hesitant ally of the Union.|$|E
5000|$|Matchbook FX {{functioned as}} an open limit order-book, {{also known as}} a Central Limit Order Book or CLOB - similar to an online {{exchange}} - where any participant subscribed to the network could either post its own bids and offers just like a market maker, or immediately trade on any other existing bids and offers for a given currency. This process allowed users to join or better the <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices</b> in the network and thus directly impact (and tighten) the bid-ask spread widths on which they traded. As such, Matchbook FX was considered {{to be one of the}} main catalysts that presaged rapid technological advances, sharp compressions in bid/ask spreads, and other sweeping changes into the currency market.|$|E

5000|$|In {{economic}}s, {{an excess}} supply or economic surplus {{is a situation}} in which the quantity of a good or service supplied is more than the quantity demanded, and the price is above the equilibrium level determined by supply and demand.

50|$|Adding oil {{recovery}} methods {{adds to the}} cost of oil —in the case of CO2 typically between 0.5-8.0 US$ per tonne of CO2. The increased extraction of oil on the other hand, is an economic benefit with the revenue depending on prevailing oil prices. Onshore EOR has paid in the range of a net 10-16 US$ per tonne of CO2 injected for oil prices of 15-20 US$/barrel. <b>Prevailing</b> <b>prices</b> depend on many factors but can determine the economic suitability of any procedure, with more procedures and more expensive procedures being economically viable at higher prices. Example: With oil prices at around 90 US$/barrel, the economic benefit is about 70 US$ per tonne CO2. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that 20 billion tons of captured CO2 could produce 67 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil.|$|E
50|$|Villages Being Transformed: It has {{not been}} {{uncommon}} for villagers to travel long distances to district/taluk headquarters {{in order to obtain}} copies of public records, submit applications, meet officials, or to seek information regarding their day-to-day needs or to enquire <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices</b> in commodity markets etc. This involves the loss of a day's income as well as the cost of transportation. Once at the government office, the relevant record, information, or official could be unavailable, forcing repeated visits and additional expenses. In effect, government officials working with paper records enjoy a monopoly over information. Villagers may also face discomfort, harassment, and corruption on the part of public officials, or are often given incorrect information about government programs or market prices. In fact, compared to urban populace, the rural people were often forced to pay a disproportionate share of their income for gathering information.|$|E
50|$|From the 1750s to 1800s, Paracale {{held the}} major Spanish mines, {{but due to}} its closure in the 1790s, its people were living in {{desultory}} gold washing, fishing and selling betel nut to Mambulao which has now became the mining center. During that time, {{there were plenty of}} small shops but there’s no rice fields and vegetable gardening. All necessities came from Ambos Camarines and Tayabas (Quezon). Fifteen years later, the mines of Mambulao were no longer open. There was still some haphazard gold washing by women of Indio Class whose husbands, it was alleged, gambled away their meager earning in card games run by the town mayor. But by 1818, the population was back to the levels of the 1790s and by the mid-1820s annual gold production levels ran as 3,200 ounces (90.7 kg.) worth Php. 44,000 at <b>prevailing</b> <b>prices.</b> By 1829, Camarines Norte was considered to be wealthy and populous enough to warrant separation as province of its own for the first time. But after the 1840s the mining and population declined. Dr. Fedor Jagor (in his book Travels in the Philippines and The former Philippines thru Foreign Eyes), a well known German traveler who visited Mambulao in 1859, reported that it was thinly populated and that the mining mania was already ruined. From 1837 to 1876 the population of Mambulao and Paracale decreased by 30%.|$|E

50|$|The {{overall system}} {{involves}} two state variables: price and capacity. Using the temporary equilibrium method, {{it can be}} reduced to a system involving only state variable. This is possible because each short-run equilibrium price will be a function of the prevailing capacity, and the change of capacity will be determined by the <b>prevailing</b> <b>price.</b> Hence the change of capacity will be determined by the prevailing capacity. The method works if the price adjusts fast and capacity adjustment is comparatively slow. The mathematical background is provided by the Moving equilibrium theorem.|$|R

50|$|A {{firm with}} market power {{has the ability}} to {{individually}} affect either the total quantity or the <b>prevailing</b> <b>price</b> in the market. Price makers face a downward-sloping demand curve, such that price increases lead to a lower quantity demanded.
