5|$|During one {{period of}} {{rotation}} for PSR B1937+21, there are two peaks observed, known as the pulse and interpulse. PSR B1937+21 is unusual among pulsars in that it occasionally produces pulses far brighter than an average <b>pulse.</b> <b>Until</b> 1995, the sole other pulsar known to produce giant pulses was the Crab pulsar, and by 2006, there were 11 pulsars that had been observed to produce giant pulses {{out of more than}} 1500 known pulsars. The giant pulses of PSR B1937+21 were first observed in 1984, shortly after its discovery, but difficulty in observing single pulses of PSR B1937+21 due to its fast period meant that the pulses were not studied in more depth until a decade after they were first observed. In more recent follow up observations, more giant pulses have been found. These giant pulses have been observed to occur at the trailing edge of both the pulse and interpulse. The duration of these giant pulses is short compared to the period of the pulsar, lasting on the order of 10 nanoseconds. The flux density of observed pulses is somewhat variable, but has been observed to be as high as 6.5 Wm−2Hz−1 (6.5 janskys). The brightness temperature of a pulse with such high flux density and such low duration exceeds 5 kelvins, making the pulses of PSR B1937+21 the brightest radio emission ever observed. PSR B1937+21 is intrinsically the most luminous millisecond pulsar. In addition to the radio pulses observed, pulses have been detected at x-ray wavelengths, which show the same pulse and interpulse pattern.|$|E

40|$|The {{spectacular}} {{detection of}} gravitational waves (GWs) from GW 150914 and its reported association with a gamma-ray burst (GRB) offer {{new insights into}} the evolution of massive stars. Here it is shown that no single star of any mass and credible metallicity is likely to produce the observed GW signal. Stars with helium cores in the mass range 35 to 133 solar masses encounter the pair instability and either explode or <b>pulse</b> <b>until</b> the core mass is less than 40 solar masses, smaller than the combined mass of the observed black holes. The rotation of more massive helium cores is either braked by interaction with a slowly rotating hydrogen envelope, if one is present, or by mass loss, if one is not. The very short interval between the GW signal and the observed onset of the putative GRB in GW 150914 is also too short to have come from a single star. A more probable model for making the gravitational radiation is the delayed merger of two black holes made by 70 and 90 solar mass stars in a binary system. The more massive component was a pulsational-pair instability supernova before making the first black hole. Comment: Submitted to Astrophysical Journal Letters February 29, 201...|$|E
40|$|We explore {{opportunities}} for multi-messenger astronomy using gravitational waves (GWs) and prompt, transient low-frequency radio emission to study highly energetic astrophysical events. We review {{the literature on}} possible sources of correlated emission of gravitational waves and radio transients, highlighting proposed mechanisms that lead to a short-duration, high-flux radio pulse originating from the merger of two neutron stars or from a superconducting cosmic string cusp. We discuss the detection prospects {{for each of these}} mechanisms by low-frequency dipole array instruments such as LWA 1, LOFAR and MWA. We find that a broad range of models may be tested by searching for radio pulses that, when de-dispersed, are temporally and spatially coincident with a LIGO/Virgo GW trigger within a 30 second time window and 200 500 deg^ 2 sky region. We consider various possible observing strategies and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Uniquely, for low-frequency radio arrays, dispersion can delay the radio <b>pulse</b> <b>until</b> after low-latency GW data analysis has identified and reported an event candidate, enabling a prompt radio signal to be captured by a deliberately targeted beam. If neutron star mergers do have detectable prompt radio emissions, a coincident search with the GW detector network and low-frequency radio arrays could increase the LIGO/Virgo effective search volume by up to a factor of 2. For some models, we also map the parameter space that may be constrained by non-detections. Comment: 31 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|Plasma {{spots are}} known to form at field {{emission}} sites in regions of high dc or rf electric field. Several mechanisms {{for the formation of}} plasma spots in an rf field have been proposed, and one such mechanism which fits experimental data is presented in this paper. However, a plasma spot by itself does not produce breakdown. A single plasma spot, with a lifetime on the order of 30 ns, extracts only a negligible amount of energy from the rf field. The evidence for its existence is a small crater, on the order of 10 µm in diameter, left behind on the surface. In this paper we present a model in which plasma spots act as a trigger to produce surface melting on a macroscopic scale (~ 0. 1 mm 2). Once surface melting occurs, a plasma that is capable of emitting several kiloamperes of electrons can form over the molten region. A key observation that must be explained by any theory of breakdown is that the probability of breakdown is independent of time within the rf pulse—breakdown is just as likely to occur {{at the beginning of the}} pulse as toward the end. In the model presented here, the conditions for breakdown develop over many <b>pulses</b> <b>until</b> a critical threshold for breakdown is reached...|$|R
