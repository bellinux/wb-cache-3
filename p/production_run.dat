Warner Bros. also made available in the United States a limited Blu-ray edition packaged in a metal replica of the PASIV briefcase, which included extras such as a metal replica of the spinning top totem. With a <b>production</b> <b>run</b> of less than 2000, it sold out in one weekend.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{there was}} an {{intention}} to procure up to 400 aircraft for the Royal Navy and the RAF, but the development cost for the changes to accommodate the Spey turbofans meant that the per-unit price eventually ended up three times the price of an F-4J. Because the government then had a policy of negotiating fixed-price contracts, these costs could not be evened out by a large <b>production</b> <b>run,</b> which left the total order at 170.|$|E

5|$|The Rolls-Royce R was a British {{aero engine}} {{designed}} and built specifically for air racing purposes by Rolls-Royce Limited. Nineteen R engines were assembled in a limited <b>production</b> <b>run</b> between 1929 and 1931. Developed from the Rolls-Royce Buzzard, it was a 37-litre (2,240cu in) capacity, supercharged V-12 capable of producing just under 2,800horsepower (2,090kW), and weighed 1,640pounds (770kg). Intensive factory testing revealed mechanical failures which were remedied by redesigning the components, greatly improving reliability.|$|E

5|$|A {{short run}} of Gran Trak systems was {{produced}} in March 1974 and revealed other design problems, such as the steering controls; in their prototype system, Eigen used real a real car steering wheel and pedals, but the <b>production</b> <b>run</b> used different parts. Alcorn returned to Cyan that month and redesigned the game to fix the flaws and use more standard parts; the copying protection scheme was changed to use a custom-designed integrated circuit that was named {{the same as a}} standard Texas Instruments integrated circuit. Alcorn later stated in an interview that neither Warman nor Emmons understood the challenges in converting a prototype design to a product that could be manufactured. The game entered production soon after, and Atari announced it was shipping a full <b>production</b> <b>run</b> in May 1974. Although the design flaws were fixed, the communication problems during development led to one final problem with the game: Atari was unclear on the actual cost of producing the game. As a result, a single Gran Trak game ended up costing US$1,095 to manufacture, while Atari was selling them to distributors for only $995, losing $100 per sale. Atari soon corrected the problem, but ended the fiscal year with a large loss {{due in part to the}} financial failure of the game.|$|E
5|$|After a small {{quantity}} {{was struck}} for circulation, the Mint received complaints regarding the prominent placement of Gobrecht's {{name on the}} dollar, and the design was modified to incorporate his name in a less conspicuous position. In January 1837, the legal standard for the percentage of precious metal in silver coins was changed from 89.2% to 90%, and the Gobrecht dollars struck after that point reflect this change. In total, 1,900 Gobrecht dollars were struck during the official <b>production</b> <b>run.</b> Production of the Seated Liberty dollar, which utilized the same obverse design as the Gobrecht dollar, began mintage in 1840. In the 1850s, Mint officials controversially re-struck the coins without authorization.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>production</b> <b>run,</b> the Navy {{decided to}} move the Chance Vought factory from Stratford, Connecticut to a much larger {{facility}} in Dallas, Texas which had been vacant {{since the end of}} World War II; this badly disrupted the production of the Pirate. The airframes were built in Stratford and trucked to Dallas where government-furnished equipment, such as the engines and afterburners, were installed. The completed aircraft were then taxied around the new plant's airfield, but the runway was deemed too short to handle jets. The aircraft had to be disassembled and trucked to an abandoned airfield at Ardmore, Oklahoma with a runway long enough for acceptance testing.|$|E

5|$|In April 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) {{assessed}} the F-22's cost to be $361million per aircraft, with $28billion invested in development and testing; the Unit Procurement Cost {{was estimated at}} $178million in 2006, based on a <b>production</b> <b>run</b> of 181 aircraft. It was estimated {{by the end of}} production, $34billion will have been spent on procurement, resulting in a total program cost of $62billion, around $339million per aircraft. The incremental cost for an additional F-22 was estimated at about $138million in 2009. The GAO stated the estimated cost was $412 million per aircraft in 2012.|$|E

5|$|Jean and Reiss left The Simpsons {{after its}} fourth season {{in order to}} create The Critic, an {{animated}} show about film critic Jay Sherman (voiced by Jon Lovitz); the show was executive produced by Brooks. It was first broadcast on ABC in January 1994 and was well received by critics, but did not catch on with viewers and was put on hiatus after six weeks. It returned in June 1994 and completed airing its initial <b>production</b> <b>run.</b> The Critic was moved to the Fox network for its second season. Since The Simpsons also aired on that network, Brooks was able to create a crossover between it and The Critic.|$|E
5|$|Procurement of the Arrow from Canada, {{and setting}} up a {{production}} line in the UK, was studied, the unit price per aircraft built in the UK being estimated at Â£220,000 each for a <b>production</b> <b>run</b> of 100 aircraft, {{as opposed to the}} estimate of Â£150,000 per aircraft for the thin wing Javelin. The CF-105 would serve as a stopgap until the UK's F.155 project came to fruition; however with the F.155 due in 1963 and the Arrow not likely to reach the RAF before 1962, there was little point in proceeding.|$|E
5|$|Similar alloys {{with the}} {{addition}} of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low <b>production</b> <b>run</b> applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive. For building facades, roofing, and other applications for sheet metal formed by deep drawing, roll forming, or bending, zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used. Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes.|$|E

5|$|The Odyssey was {{released}} by Magnavox in September 1972. After initially ordering a <b>production</b> <b>run</b> of 50,000 units, prior to release Magnavox increased its production capabilities and built up a large stock of the systems, as market testing had shown an enthusiastic response to the console. The Odyssey was sold only through Magnavox dealers and not through general retailers; Magnavox felt that as the first video game console it would draw consumers into its stores. The device retailed for US$99.99, or US$50 when purchased along with a Magnavox television. There are conflicting reports between Baer and Magnavox employees as to whether Magnavox produced 120,000 or 140,000 consoles in 1972; additionally, Odyssey product manager Bob Fritsche recalls selling 69,000 units that year, while Baer recalls sales being closer to 100,000. Baer has stated that he felt the low initial sales were due to the high priceâUS$100 being the equivalent of US$587 in 2017âand because of Magnavox restricting sales to their dealerships and implying that the device only worked with Magnavox televisions. Other sources have stated that dealership salespeople would try to mislead customers to that effect {{in order to try}} to sell more television sets. Magnavox assistant product planner Don Emry has noted that the sales were in line with the original projections, if not with the <b>production</b> <b>run.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Panzer IV was {{partially}} succeeded by the Panther medium tank, which {{was introduced to}} counter the Soviet T-34, although the Panzer IV continued as a significant component of German armoured formations {{to the end of}} the war. The Panzer IV was the most widely exported tank in German service, with around 300 sold to Finland, Romania, Spain and Bulgaria. After the war, Syria procured Panzer IVs from France and Czechoslovakia, which saw combat in the 1967 Six-Day War. 8,553 Panzer IVs of all versions were built during World War II, with only the StuG III assault-gun/tank destroyer's 10,086 vehicle <b>production</b> <b>run</b> exceeding the Panzer IV's total among Axis armored forces.|$|E
5|$|The first 25 were {{constructed}} at Nine Elms Locomotive Works between March and November 1897. Thereafter the M7 class {{had a long}} <b>production</b> <b>run</b> with five major sets of design variants. Between 1897 and 1899 the locomotives {{were constructed}} with a short overhang at the front, and sandboxes combined with the front splashers. Injectors and a lever-type reverser were also added, and a conical, as opposed to flat, smokebox door was implemented on numbers 252â256. In 1900 the design was modified to incorporate the sandboxes inside the smokebox; these were later relocated below the running plate.|$|E
