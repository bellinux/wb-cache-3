2500|$|In Europe, the {{induction}} of active immunity emerged {{in an attempt}} to contain smallpox. Immunization, however, had existed in various forms for at least a thousand years. The earliest use of immunization is unknown, however, around 1000 A.D. the Chinese began practicing a form of immunization by drying and inhaling powders derived from the crusts of smallpox lesions. [...] Around the fifteenth century in India, the Ottoman Empire, and east Africa, the practice of inoculation (poking the skin with <b>powdered</b> <b>material</b> derived from smallpox crusts) became quite common. This practice was first introduced into the west in 1721 by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. In 1798, Edward Jenner introduced the far safer method of deliberate infection with [...] cowpox virus, (smallpox vaccine), which caused a mild infection that also induced immunity to smallpox. By 1800 the procedure was referred to as vaccination. To avoid confusion, smallpox inoculation was increasingly referred to as variolation, and it became common practice to use this term without regard for chronology. The success and general acceptance of Jenner's procedure would later drive the general nature of vaccination developed by Pasteur and others {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. In 1891, Pasteur widened the definition of vaccine in honour of Jenner and it then became essential to qualify the term, by referring to polio vaccine, measles vaccine etc.|$|E

50|$|An {{additive}} manufacturing layer technology, SLS {{involves the use}} of a high power laser (for example, a carbon dioxide laser) to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass that has a desired three-dimensional shape. The laser selectively fuses <b>powdered</b> <b>material</b> by scanning cross-sections generated from a 3-D digital description of the part (for example from a CAD file or scan data) on the surface of a powder bed. After each cross-section is scanned, the powder bed is lowered by one layer thickness, a new layer of material is applied on top, and the process is repeated until the part is completed.|$|E
50|$|This {{powder bed}} method {{produces}} fully dense metal parts directly from metal powder with {{characteristics of the}} target material. The EBM machine reads data from a 3D CAD model and lays down successive layers of <b>powdered</b> <b>material.</b> These layers are melted together utilizing a computer-controlled electron beam. In this way it builds up the parts. The process takes place under vacuum, which makes it suited to manufacture parts in reactive materials with a high affinity for oxygen, e.g. titanium. The process is known to operate at higher temperatures (up to 1000 °C), {{which can lead to}} differences in phase formation though solidification and solid-state phase transformation.|$|E
50|$|The {{total number}} of layers {{required}} to build the whole part is directly proportional to {{the height of the}} part measured along the build direction.

These processes require a significant amount of time thus redesigning the product for smaller heights may save manufacturing time greatly. The build orientation should be such that the height of the part should be least along the build direction.|$|E

50|$|Laser {{engineered}} net shaping (LENS) is an {{additive manufacturing}} technique for rapidly fabricating, enhancing and repairing metal components directly from CAD data. The processes use a high power {{solid state laser}} focused onto a metal substrate to create a ~1 mm diameter melt pool. Metal powder is then injected into the melt pool to increase the material volume and build up the component layer by layer. Experimental gas thrusters (build time 8 hours) and automotive brackets have been manufactured in Ti-Grade 5. Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is similar, except that the laser selectively fuses <b>powdered</b> <b>material</b> by scanning {{on the surface of}} a powder bed.

50|$|Selective laser {{sintering}} (SLS) is an additive manufacturing (AM) technique {{that uses a}} laser as the power source to sinter <b>powdered</b> <b>material</b> (typically nylon/polyamide), aiming the laser automatically at points in space defined by a 3D model, binding the material {{together to create a}} solid structure. It is similar to direct metal {{laser sintering}} (DMLS); the two are instantiations of the same concept but differ in technical details. Selective laser melting (SLM) uses a comparable concept, but in SLM the material is fully melted rather than sintered, allowing different properties (crystal structure, porosity, and so on). SLS (as well as the other mentioned AM techniques) is a relatively new technology that so far has mainly been used for rapid prototyping and for low-volume production of component parts. Production roles are expanding as the commercialization of AM technology improves.|$|E

30|$|Firstly, if {{the packing}} density of metal powders is low, e.g., 50 percent, the gas present between the powder {{particles}} may dissolve in the molten pool. Because of the high cooling rate during the solidification process, the dissolved gas cannot {{come out of the}} surface of the molten pool before solidification takes place. Porosities are thus formed and remain in the fabricated part. Porosities may also be formed when metal powders of a hollow structure are utilized in an SLM process. On the other hand, the molten pool temperature is generally high due to the intense laser power. At this temperature, gas solubility in the liquid metal is high, making its enrichment easier. Furthermore, in the process of preparing <b>powder</b> <b>materials,</b> gas is inevitably introduced into the <b>powder</b> <b>materials,</b> especially the gas atomized <b>powder</b> <b>materials</b> in the scope of protection by an inert gas, such as argon or helium.|$|R
