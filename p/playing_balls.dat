500|$|During these pre-first-class seasons, Newton made a {{name for}} himself, and in his {{official}} history of the club, Peter Roebuck describes him as one of the talents of the side. He took on the captaincy of the club in 1880, a season in which he passed 30 runs in five of the recorded seven innings in which he played. His highest score recorded on CricketArchive during these years for Somerset was the 91 which he scored in 1876 against the Gentlemen of Dorset. Team-mate Bill Roe described Newton as a useful batsman who favoured <b>playing</b> <b>balls</b> on his pads. In his obituary, Newton was described as being [...] "a most excellent field", particularly strong at cover-point, while Haygarth's Scores and Biographies characterised him as [...] "a fine and free hitter, and a most excellent field". He was the county's top run-scorer in 1877, accumulating 285 runs at an average of 25.90, and he was also one of their principle bowlers, collecting 21 wickets during the season. He remained {{near the top of the}} batting charts for the club the following year, scoring the second-most runs behind Edward Sainsbury, 146 at an average of 18.25. He was used less as a bowler than in the previous year, taking just six wickets. He once again trailed only Sainsbury amongst batsmen in 1880, scoring 278 runs at an average of 30.88. He was appointed as the club captain for 1881, though he was not able to play as frequently for the club, and finished the season with 93 runs from five innings at an average of 18.3.|$|E
500|$|In September 2010 he {{went out}} on another month's loan, this time to League One club Walsall, where he had spent time as a junior. The Birmingham Mail {{reported}} that on his debut, in a defeat at Rochdale, he had [...] "a quiet first half but showed some impressive touches {{in the second period}} and fitted well into Walsall's 4–3–3 formation." [...] His captain, Darren Byfield, [...] "thought David was superb. Usually when you have players who love to tackle and get in your face, they can't use the ball– but he was <b>playing</b> <b>balls</b> around the corners and off the strikers. You can see already he's not one of those who come from the Premiership thinking 'what am I doing here?' He's listening to people and his attitude is superb." [...] He played the whole of Walsall's six matches during his initial month, apart from the last 15 minutes against Swindon Town when he was stretchered off with an injured ankle. The first five of those sixfour losses and a drawsaw Walsall drop from 13th place to bottom of the table, and, again according to the Mail, Davis [...] "did as well as can be expected from a 19-year-old pitched into a team in freefall". The loan was extended for another month, but because Wolves had injury problems, manager Mick McCarthy included a clause allowing them to recall him at 24 hours notice if they needed him. Davis played just once more for Walsall before he was recalled. With three first-team midfielders unavailable, McCarthy included him on the bench for Wolves' Premier League visit to Chelsea; he remained unused.|$|E

50|$|Luc {{was born}} in Bayonne, France, the {{youngest}} of three brothers. He studied at the prestigious Academy de Bayonne as a child, mastering the guitar, cello, violin, and mandolin. His two elder brothers (Gérard, the eldest, playing the accordion and Serge, playing drums) were both musicians who regularly played in balls. At the age of 4, he laid his hands on a toy guitar with only three strings left on it and was allowed to accompany his brothers on rehearsals. Even {{at such a young}} age, he was able to play accurate chords. As a result, he started touring with his brothers <b>playing</b> <b>balls</b> at a very early age.|$|E
50|$|A hazard {{is an area}} of a {{golf course}} in the sport of golf which {{provides}} a difficult obstacle, which may be of two types: (1) water hazards such as lakes and rivers; and (2) man-made hazards such as bunkers. Special rules apply to <b>playing</b> <b>balls</b> that fall in a hazard. For example, a player may not touch the ground with his club before playing a ball, not even for a practice swing. A ball in any hazard may be played as it lies without penalty. If it cannot be played from the hazard, the ball may be hit from another location, generally with a penalty of one stroke. The Rules of Golf govern exactly from where the ball may be played outside a hazard. Bunkers (or sand traps) are shallow pits filled with sand and generally incorporating a raised lip or barrier, from which the ball is more difficult to play than from grass.|$|E

5000|$|Lewis also {{attended}} Saint Mary's College of California, {{and joined the}} Red Sox in 1910, completing the Golden Outfield. [...] Until the 1930s, the Red Sox' home park, Fenway Park had a slope {{in front of the}} left field wall. Lewis was so effective at <b>playing</b> <b>balls</b> off the cliff that it was nicknamed Duffy's Cliff. [...] Lewis played with the Red Sox until 1917, and led the American League in sacrifice hits in 1912. [...] He received MVP votes in 1914, finishing tied with Hooper at 20th overall in the voting. [...] During his time with the Red Sox, he batted [...]286, with 1248 hits in 4325 at bats. [...] Lewis has not been elected to the Hall of Fame, but did receive votes in several elections from 1937 through 1955. His best showing was in 1955 when he received 34 votes and 13.5% of the total, far below the 75% needed for election.|$|E
