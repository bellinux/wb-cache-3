Alternatively, the signal may be incorporated into the authentication process itself, typically {{in the form of a}} panic password, distress password, or duress PIN that is distinct from the user's normal password or PIN.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} factors that are associated with expectation of panic attacks as well as to validate the hypothesized tendency to identify false (<b>panic)</b> <b>alarms</b> in <b>panic</b> disorder. Ten women with panic disorder were assessed naturalistically using computer-assisted self-monitoring. This allowed for prospective assessment of expected versus unexpected panic attacks. Expectation of panic attacks was associated with panic occurrence, as well as elevated sense of threat or danger, anxiety, helplessness, avoidance, distress about physical symptoms, physical sensations, and catastrophic thoughts prior to the attack. In general the state measured prior to unexpected attacks did not differ from ongoing nonpanic state. Furthermore, none of the variables measured during the attacks were able to distinguish unexpected attacks from expected attacks. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Background: The after-hours {{house call}} (AHHC) service in Australia is growing, but studies have never {{explored}} the doctor variables associated with burnout and stress within the service. This study fills this knowledge gap. Aims: To determine the doctor variables associated with burnout and stress among doctors involved in AHHC. Methods: A quantitative, questionnaire-based survey of all 300 doctors engaged in AHHC through the National Home Doctor Service (NHDS), Australia’s largest home visiting doctor-service provider. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) {{was used to}} assess burnout over a 12 -month period from October 2013 to September 2014. Ordinal logistics regression was used to identify significant associations. Results: There were 168 valid responses received, giving a 56 per cent response rate. The most significant factor associated with reduced stress and burnout is the adoption of self-protection measures while on the job. Such measures include the use of chaperones, the use of <b>panic</b> <b>alarms</b> or buttons, adopting de-escalation techniques, and reliance on relevant surgery policies. Other associations with reduced stress include the attainment of postgraduate fellowships (vocational registration), working less than 24 hours per week, being in legally recognised partnerships, and being male. Conversely, having general practice as a career, being under 40 years of age, and obtaining primary medical degrees from Australia (as opposed to overseas) are all associated with increased burnout for doctors involved in AHHC. Conclusion: A number of doctor variables have been found to significantly reduce burnout in AHHC Among these, the adoption of self-protective measures and the attainment postgraduate fellowships, where possible, should be encouraged among practitioners involved in the service.
