Of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank, he said, [...] "our banking hall, like any other, is made of marble and big marble columns. And it has great strength. The fact that the goblins are the bankers and tellers at the counter helps that feeling of grandeur and solidity and the big proportions. That {{was part of the}} fun of the set: we exaggerated the size of it, we exaggerated the weight of it, and we even exaggerated the shine of the marble." [...] About the multiplication of treasure in one of the bank's vaults, he noted, [...] "We made literally thousands of pieces for it and vacuum metallised them to be shiny gold and silver.

40|$|The <b>physical</b> <b>swelling</b> of {{uncharged}} {{graphite composite}} electrodes due to electrolyte-binder interactions is investigated by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) using 2, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 1, 4,-dimethoxybenzene as a redox mediator. A series of approach curves {{at the same}} location is conducted in order to quantify in situ and locally the <b>physical</b> <b>swelling.</b> The film thickness change δfilm amounted to 9. 1 μm on average for a 80 μm thick uncharged graphite composite electrode in LP 40 electrolyte between 1. 1 and 5. 9 h. Curves of δfilm vs. t usually reach a saturation within 12 h. The swelling ratio χ varies from 0. 3 % to 17. 6 % for uncharged graphite composite electrodes from the same batch in the same electrolyte. In contrast, the 8 μm thick polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) model sample swelled by χ = 99 %. Approach curves demonstrate that swelling of the PVDF is the main cause for the <b>physical</b> <b>swelling</b> of uncharged graphite composite electrodes. Both PVDF model sample and uncharged graphite composite electrodes show locally different swelling ratios by SECM imaging. Based on these results a swelling model is proposed, where the uncharged graphite composite electrode swells physically on average by at least χ = 11 % and the local topography is changing during swelling. © The Author(s) 2015.

40|$|Arrays of polymer films {{embedded}} with conductive or resistive material have attracted significant attention as “electronic noses”. Sorption of a vapor into the polymer films causes <b>physical</b> <b>swelling,</b> {{which leads to}} a change in the DC electrical resistance of the film. Like the receptors of the mammalian olfactory system, each polymer-based detector responds to more than one analyte and each analyte elicits a response from more than one detector. The DC resistance across the array of detectors is sampled versus time producing a multivariate time-series. Except when rapid response is critical, this multivariate time-series can be converted into a vector representation by focusing on the steady-state behavior and calculating the relative change in resistance in each channel relative to an initial baseline. In this paper, we provide an overview of our efforts to mine useful information from electronic nose data. Four case studies are presented: rapid detection of DNT (dinitrotoluene) vapors at very low concentrations (< 1 part-per-billion), pairwise discrimination between chemically similar analytes (e. g., H 2 O and D 2 O; heptane and hexane), prediction of human percepts of odor quality from electronic nose detector responses, and classification of vapors into the appropriate chemical family (e. g., saying methanol is an alcohol without having previously smelled methanol) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The general {{swelling}} {{model has}} recently been updated in Israel by applying the Excel-solver command (ESC) analysis to new local test results from 897 undisturbed specimens. In this analysis, the goodness-of-fit statistics obtained classify the category of their as-sociated regression only as fair. Thus, it seems necessary to explore the possibility of enhancing the outputs of this regression analysis by applying the artificial neural networks (ANN) methodology to the same 897 undisturbed specimens. However, it is shown {{that the use of}} the ANN outputs should be accompanied by an additional check to ensure that they follow the expected <b>physical</b> <b>swelling</b> behavior, as char-acterized by the index properties of the soil. The ANN methodology applied in this paper is similar to previous studies in geotechnical engineering. Different models were tested using the same database (i. e., the same 897 undisturbed specimens). The statistical fit of the ANN models were clearly found to be superior to the ESC models. However, {{in the sense of the}} required physical behavior, as characterized by the index properties of the soil, the ANN models did not predict swelling values as well as ESC models did, in particular values ranging near (or outside) the data set boundaries. Thus, the former ESC models still remain preferable. DOI: 10. 1061 /(ASCE) MT. 1943 - 553...|$|E
40|$|To impact carbon emissions, new {{materials}} for carbon capture must be inexpensive, robust, {{and able to}} adsorb CO 2 specifically from a mixture of other gases. In particular, materials must be tolerant to the water vapor and to the acidic impurities that are present in gas streams produced by using fossil fuels to generate electricity. We show that a porous organic polymer has excellent CO 2 capacity and high CO 2 selectivity under conditions relevant to precombustion CO 2 capture. Unlike polar adsorbents, such as zeolite 13 x and the metal–organic framework, HKUST- 1, the CO 2 adsorption capacity for the hydrophobic polymer is hardly affected by the adsorption of water vapor. The polymer is even stable to boiling in concentrated acid for extended periods, a property that is matched by few microporous adsorbents. The polymer adsorbs CO 2 {{in a different way}} from rigid materials by <b>physical</b> <b>swelling,</b> much as a sponge adsorbs water. This gives rise to a higher CO 2 capacities and much better CO 2 selectivity than for other water-tolerant, nonswellable frameworks, such as activated carbon and ZIF- 8.

40|$|International audienceWhen a crack {{forms in}} silica glass, the {{surrounding}} environment {{flows into the}} crack opening, and water from the environment reacts with the glass to promote crack growth. A chemical reaction between water and the strained crack-tip bonds is commonly regarded {{as the cause of}} subcritical crack growth in glass. In silica glass, water can also have a secondary effect on crack growth. By penetrating into the glass, water generates a zone of swelling and, hence, creates a compression zone around the crack tip and on the newly formed fracture surfaces. This zone of compression acts as a fracture mechanics shield to the stresses at the crack tip, modifying both the strength and subcritical crack growth resistance of the glass. Water penetration is especially apparent in silica glass because of its low density {{and the fact that it}} contains no modifier ions. Using diffusion data from the literature, we show that the diffusion of water into silica glass can explain several significant experimental observations that have been reported on silica glass, including (1) the strengthening of silica glass by soaking the glass in water at elevated temperatures, (2) the observation of permanent crack face displacements near the crack tip of a silica specimen that had been soaked in water under load, and (3) the observation of high concentrations of water close to the fracture surfaces that had been formed in water. These effects are consistent with a model suggesting that crack growth in silica glass is modified by a <b>physical</b> <b>swelling</b> of the glass around the crack tip. An implication of water-induced swelling during fracture is that silica glass is more resistant to crack growth than it would be if swelling did not occur...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} kinetics of the liquid-phase transesterification of ethyl acetate with methanol {{have been investigated}} over a series of commercially available ion-exchange resins. Two morphology types of cross-linked polymer resins have been considered, i. e., a gel type (Lewatit K 1221) and a macroporous type (Lewatit K 2640, Lewatit K 2629 and Amberlyst 15). The effect of the swelling of the resin, the initial reactant molar ratio (1 : 1 – 10 : 1) and the temperature (303. 15 – 333. 15 K) on the {{reaction kinetics}} was experimentally assessed. Lewatit K 1221, the gel-type resin, outperformed the macroporous-type resins, despite its similar number of sulfonic acid sites. The resin’s swelling behavior, which {{can be related to}} its degree of cross-linking with divinylbenzene, was identified as the key parameter to explain differences in acid site accessibility between the considered resins and, hence, the observed transesterification kinetics. A fundamental kinetic model, accounting for the chemical elementary steps {{as well as for the}} <b>physical</b> <b>swelling</b> due to solvent absorption, was constructed to quantitatively assess the experimental observations. According to this model (1) all active sites are occupied by methanol in protonated form, (2) the esters undergo a proton exchange with the protonated methanol and (3) the reaction occurs through an Eley-Rideal mechanism with the surface reaction of protonated ethyl acetate with methanol from the bulk as the rate-determining step. The kinetic model was able to adequately describe the entire experimental data set. An activation energy amounting to 49 kJ mol- 1 was obtained, irrespective of the resin. Also the affinity of each of the resins for the esters was found to be similar. The differences in catalytic activity between the considered resins are found back in the values for the rate coefficients and, hence, can be brought into relation with the active site accessibility. The latter is a factor 3 to 4 higher for gel-type resins compared to macroporous-type resins. An independent experimental assessment of the resins’ swelling behavior confirmed the more pronounced swelling of the gel-type compared to the macroporous-type resins...|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the McNeal clay {{swelling}} model, including its underpinning assumptions and the method for determining its parameters, was undertaken. Limitations of the model include model parameter identification, the fixed threshold exchangeable sodium percentage level at which hydraulic conductivity begins to decline, and {{the assumption that the}} expanding clay will always be 10 % of the soil. To overcome these problems, an improved form of the model that accommodates a range of clay content is proposed.

The model produced good agreement between the observed and estimated saturated hydraulic conductivities over the entire range of irrigation salinity (3 – 200 mmolc/L) and sodicity used for the original swelling model. The modified model was also successfully validated against three new sets of relative hydraulic conductivity data.
