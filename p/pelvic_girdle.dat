5|$|In frogs the <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdle</b> is {{robust and}} the hind legs are much longer and {{stronger}} than the forelimbs. The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or {{in contact with the}} ground and they have a long tail. Caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have a {{skeletal}} {{system that is}} structurally homologous to other tetrapods, though {{with a number of}} variations. They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The musculo{{skeletal system}} is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The pectoral girdle is supported by muscle, and the well-developed <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdle</b> is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} {{earliest}} phylogenetic analyses of the group, Gardiner (1983) recognized five characteristics that made Temnospondyli a clade: a bone {{at the back of the}} skull, the parasphenoid, is connected to another bone on the underside of the skull, the pterygoid; large openings called interpterygoid vacuities are present between the pterygoids; the stapes (a bone involved in hearing) is connected to the parasphenoid and projects upward; the cleithrum, a bone in the pectoral girdle, is thin; and part of the vertebra called the interdorsal attaches to the neural arch. Additional features were given by Godfrey et al. (1987), including the contact between the postparietal and exoccipital at the back of the skull, small projections (uncinate processes) on the ribs, and a <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdle</b> with each side having a single iliac blade. These shared characteristics are called synapomorphies.|$|E

50|$|SAM 6046, {{one of the}} paratypes of Mesosuchus, {{consists}} of an incomplete right maxilla, an articulated series of the last ten presacrals, both sacrals, and first six caudals, partial forelimbs, left and right <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdles,</b> right hind limb, as well as element of left tarsus.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pelvic</b> <b>girdles</b> {{fall into}} two types. The first, {{thought to be the}} {{primitive}} condition, bears virtually the entire pelvic fin. The second, consists of a prominent metapterygial plate. The claspers, in the male, are separated from the body of the fin by about four blocks of calcified cartilage.|$|R
5|$|For {{temperate}} living bats, births typically {{take place}} in May or June in the northern hemisphere while births in the southern hemisphere occur in November and December. Tropical species give birth {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season. In most bat species, female carry and give birth to one pup per litter. For bat embryos, apoptosis only affects the hindlimbs, while the forelimbs retain webbing between the digits which form into the wing membranes. At birth, a bat pup can be up to 40 percent of the mother's weight, and hence the <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdle</b> of the female expands during birth as the two halves are connected by a flexible ligament. Females typically give birth in a heads-up or horizontal position, using gravity to make birthing easier. The young emerges rear-first, possibly to prevent the wings from getting tangled, and the females cradles it in her wing and tail membranes. In many species, females give birth and raise their young in maternity colonies and individuals may assist others in their birthing process.|$|E
5|$|The scapula (shoulder blade) {{was longer}} than the humerus (upper arm bone); its blade was slender and narrow, and {{slightly}} twisted, following the contour of the ribs. The scapula did not expand at the upper end but was very expanded at the base. The coracoid was mainly thin and plate-like. The humerus had a slender shaft, was slightly twisted along its length, and was slightly bowed. The deltopectoral crest (where the deltoid and pectoral muscles attach) was weakly developed. The ends of the ulna were expanded, and ridges extended along the shaft. The radius was more robust than the ulna, which is unusual. When seen from above, the <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdle</b> was very broad for a bipedal archosaur, and became wider towards the hind part. The broadness of the pelvic region may have accommodated a rear extension of the gut. The ilium was elongated and the ischium was long and slender. Though the pubis is not known, it was probably reduced in size like that of Homalocephale. The femur (thigh bone) was slender and inwards curved, the tibia was slender and twisted, and the fibula was slender and wide at the upper end. The metatarsus of the foot {{appears to have been}} narrow, and the single known ungual (claw bone) of a toe was slender and slightly curved. Though the limbs of Stegoceras are not completely known, other pachycephalosaurs show that they had five-fingered hands and four toes.|$|E

5|$|The partial {{skeleton}} {{was collected}} from the red floodplain mudstone of the Sebeș Formation of Romania.

25|$|The pelvic {{region of}} the trunk is {{the lower part of}} the trunk, between the abdomen and the thighs. It {{includes}} several structures: the bony pelvis, the pelvic cavity, the pelvic floor, and the perineum. The bony pelvis (pelvic skeleton) is the part of the skeleton embedded in the pelvic {{region of the}} trunk. It is subdivided into the <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdle</b> and the pelvic spine. The <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdle</b> is composed of the appendicular hip bones (ilium, ischium, and pubis) oriented in a ring, and connects the pelvic region of the spine to the lower limbs. The pelvic spine consists of the sacrum and coccyx.|$|E
50|$|Examination of Galesaurus reveals two {{distinct}} morphs, a gracile and a robust morph. The main {{differences between the}} two morphs lie in the pectoral and <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdles,</b> as well as subtle differences in the fore and hind limbs. The morphological differences may be due to sexual dimorphism, ontogeny, or the presence of two subspecies.|$|R
50|$|H. chowi {{was found}} in the Shangshaximiao Formation. The holotype {{specimen}} consists of a nearly complete skull (25 cm long), mandibles, most of the vertebral column, partial pectoral and <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdles,</b> most of the forelimbs, fragments of hindlimbs and many osteoderms. It differs from other species of Hsisosuchus in several features of its skull and postcrania.|$|R
5|$|Both sides cite strong evidence, and the {{conflict}} {{has yet to}} be resolved. The shell of testudines distinguishes them from other vertebrates. The shell is not an exoskeleton, but a modified ribcage and part of the vertebral column. Because of the shell, the pectoral and <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdles</b> are located within the ribcage. The limb bones are also modified to accommodate to the shell.|$|R
25|$|<b>Pelvic</b> <b>girdle</b> pain (abbreviated PGP) is a {{pregnancy}} discomfort that causes pain, instability and limitation of mobility and functioning {{in any of}} the three pelvic joints.

25|$|<b>Pelvic</b> <b>girdle</b> pain. Hormones and enzymes work {{together}} to produce ligamentous relaxation and widening of the symphysis pubis during the last trimester of pregnancy. Most girdle pain occurs before birthing, and is known as diastasis of the pubic symphysis. Predisposing factors for girdle pain include maternal obesity.|$|E
25|$|Chatterjee {{asserts that}} the <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdle</b> is apomorphic {{comparative}} to archaic birds and displays a retroverted pubis, fusion of the ischium and ilium, an antitrochanter, {{and the presence of}} a renal fossa. The pubis does appear to display opisthopuby, although this has yet to be verified. The alleged fusion of the ischium and ilium into an ilioischiadic plate is currently not substantiated by the fossils at hand, despite Chatterjee's auspicious illustration to the contrary in The Rise of Birds. At this time the <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdle</b> is not sufficiently well preserved to ascertain whether or not a renal fossa was present, although as no known avian from the Mesozoic displays a renal fossa, it is not clear why Protoavis should, even if it is more derived than Archaeopteryx. Similarly, it is unclear if the alleged antitrochanter has been correctly identified as such.|$|E

25|$|The sauropod Huabeisaurus was {{excavated}} from Upper Cretaceous sediments of {{the province}} of Shanxi, in northeast China. The skeleton was recovered in the 1990s. The holotype of Huabeisaurus is a partially articulated individual composed of teeth, cervical, dorsal, sacral, and caudal vertebrae, ribs, complete pectoral and <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdles,</b> and nearly complete limbs. Due to its relative completeness, Huabeisaurus represents a significant taxon for understanding sauropod evolution in Asia.|$|R
25|$|Based on {{comparative}} anatomy, {{there is}} consensus that snakes descended from lizards. Pythons and boas—primitive groups among modern snakes—have vestigial hind limbs: tiny, clawed digits known as anal spurs, {{which are used}} to grasp during mating. The families Leptotyphlopidae and Typhlopidae also possess remnants of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdle,</b> appearing as horny projections when visible.|$|E
25|$|By far the {{earliest}} fossils of Theropoda (not counting the basal saurischians) {{are of the}} Coelophysoidea, including Coelophysis and others, from late Triassic and early Jurassic 227-180Ma. Cladistic analysis sometimes connects these to the group called Ceratosauria. Principal features of both include changes in the <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdle</b> and hind limb that differ between the sexes. Other ceratosauria first appear in the late Jurassic of western North America.|$|E
25|$|Task-specific gait {{training}} {{may also}} lead to long-term gait improvement for patients with Parkinson's disease. Previous research studies have utilized body weight support systems during gait training, where individuals are suspended from an overhead harness with straps around the <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdle</b> as they walk on a treadmill. This form of gait training {{has been shown to}} improve long-term walking speed and a shuffling gait following a one-month intervention period.|$|E
50|$|Geoemydidae are turtles {{of various}} sizes (from about 10 to 80 cm in length) with often {{a high degree of}} sexual dimorphism. They usually have webbed toes, and their <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdles</b> {{articulate}} with their plastrons flexibly. Their necks are drawn back vertically. Their carapaces have 24 marginal scutes. The plastron is composed of 12 scutes and has no mesoplastron; the pectoral and abdominal scutes contact the marginal scutes.|$|R
50|$|The ribs of Eldeceeon are {{restricted}} to the front half of the spine, a characteristic that is not present in any tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) except mammals and their relatives. It gives a greater capacity to carry more large eggs. Each vertebra is divided into a U-shaped pleurocentrum and a smaller intercentrum, like the vertebrae of the embolomere Eoherpeton. The pectoral and <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdles</b> resemble those of the embolomere Proterogyrinus.|$|R
50|$|The {{vertebrae}} {{are also}} sphenacodontid-like (but lack the long neural spines that distinguish Dimetrodon and its kin), but {{the shoulder and}} <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdles</b> and the limbs indicate a much more advanced posture. The feet are more symmetrical, indicating that they faced forward throughout the stride, and the phalanges (toes) are reduced in length {{so that they are}} more like that of later synapsids (therapsids and mammals) (Carroll 1988 pp. 370-1).|$|R
25|$|During {{pregnancy}} in the human, hormones such as relaxin remodel this ligamentous capsule {{allowing the}} pelvic bones {{to be more}} flexible for delivery. The gap of the symphysis pubis, normally is 4–5mm but during pregnancy {{there will be an}} increase of at least 2–3mm, therefore, it is considered that a total width of up to 9mm between the two bones is normal for a pregnant woman. The symphysis pubis separates to some degree during childbirth. In some women this separation can become a diastasis of the symphysis pubis. The diastasis could be the result of a rapid birth, or a forceps delivery, or may be a prenatal condition. A diastasis of the symphysis pubis is a cause of <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdle</b> pain (PGP). Overall, about 45% of all pregnant women and 25% of all women postpartum suffer from PGP.|$|E
25|$|Vertebrae {{are defined}} by the regions of the {{vertebral}} column that they occur in, as in humans. Cervical vertebrae are those in the neck area. With {{the exception of the}} two sloth genera (Choloepus and Bradypus) and the manatee genus, (Trichechus), all mammals have seven cervical vertebrae. In other vertebrates, the number of cervical vertebrae can range from a single vertebra in amphibians, to as many as 25 in swans or 76 in the extinct plesiosaur Elasmosaurus. The dorsal vertebrae range {{from the bottom of the}} neck to the top of the pelvis. Dorsal vertebrae attached to the ribs are called thoracic vertebrae, while those without ribs are called lumbar vertebrae. The sacral vertebrae are those in the pelvic region, and range from one in amphibians, to two in most birds and modern reptiles, or up to three to five in mammals. When multiple sacral vertebrae are fused into a single structure, it is called the sacrum. The synsacrum is a similar fused structure found in birds that is composed of the sacral, lumbar, and some of the thoracic and caudal vertebra, as well as the <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdle.</b> Caudal vertebrae compose the tail, and the final few can be fused into the pygostyle in birds, or into the coccygeal or tail bone in chimpanzees (and humans).|$|E
500|$|The <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdle</b> is well-preserved {{and well}} studied. In the holotype, the <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdle</b> is almost complete, only lacking the {{proximal}} ends of each ischium. The ilia of the holotype are well known, and show many distinct features. The pubic peduncle, where the ilium articulates with the pubis, {{is long and}} straight and has an expansion on the end, as in many sauropods. The upper edge of the iliac blade is curved and thick, with rugosities (rough spots) for cartilage attachment. The pubic elements are large and robust in adults, {{more so than in}} juveniles. They are flat when viewed from in front, and [...] when seen from behind. Lapparentosaurus resembles Patagosaurus when comparing their pubes. The ischia are much more gracile than the pubes, and only have a small distal expansion. While the ilia resemble Barapasaurus, and the pubes resemble Lapparentosaurus, the ischia are most similar to Diplodocus and Apatosaurus.|$|E
50|$|The sauropod Huabeisaurus was {{excavated}} from Upper Cretaceous sediments of {{the province}} of Shanxi, in northeast China. The skeleton was recovered in the 1990s. The holotype of Huabeisaurus is a partially articulated individual composed of teeth, cervical, dorsal, sacral, and caudal vertebrae, ribs, complete pectoral and <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdles,</b> and nearly complete limbs. Due to its relative completeness, Huabeisaurus represents a significant taxon for understanding sauropod evolution in Asia.|$|R
50|$|The holotype fossil, SAM-PK-1070, is {{preserved}} in negative relief {{and has a}} partial skull, mandibles, axial skeleton, pectoral and <b>pelvic</b> <b>girdles,</b> osteoderms, and femur elements. The preserved femurs include a complete left and partial right. Partial skull elements present are the maxilla, quadrate, parabasisphenol, jugal, quadratojugal, mandible, and the palate. Little of the skull roof remains in this specimen. The alveolar region of the mandible has five teeth preserved in it.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pelvic</b> <b>girdles</b> are {{preserved}} in both fossils and shows the anteroposteriorly elongated ischium typical of synapsids {{as well as}} a blade like distal shape and a well-developed pubic foramen. The ilium is also elongated and rises anteriorly above the acetabulum. At the anterodorsal margin of the acetabulum the ilium and pubis connect posteriorly to form it. The pubis does not fuse to the ilium but instead twists to lay 90 degrees to the iliac blade.|$|R
