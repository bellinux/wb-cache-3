40|$|We derive {{non-linear}} {{differential equations}} for correlation functions of U(1) twist {{fields in the}} two-dimensional massive Dirac theory. <b>Primary</b> U(1) <b>twist</b> fields correspond to exponential fields in the sine-Gordon model at the free-fermion point, and it is well-known that their vacuum two-point functions are determined by integrable differential equations. We extend part of this result to more general quantum states (pure or mixed) and to certain descendents, showing that some two-point functions {{are determined by the}} sinh-Gordon differential equations whenever there is translation and parity invariance, and the density matrix is the exponential of a bilinear expression in fermions. We use methods involving Ward identities associated to the copy-rotation symmetry in a model with two independent, anti-commuting copies. Such methods were used {{in the context of the}} thermally perturbed Ising quantum field theory model. We show that they are applicable to the Dirac theory as well, and we suggest that they are likely to have a much wider applicability to free fermion models in general. Finally, we note that our form-factor study of descendents twist fields combined with a CFT analysis provides a new way of evaluating vacuum expectation values of <b>primary</b> U(1) <b>twist</b> fields: by deriving and solving a recursion relation.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore {{correlation}} functions in two dimensional quantum field theories in two distinct ways. In part I a new method for calculating the differential equations parametrising the correlation functions of twist fields associated with the U (1) symmetry of the Dirac model is presented. While developing this method a new family of descendent twist fields are identified and their form factors calculated. This provides a novel way of calculating the vacuum expectation values of the <b>primary</b> <b>twist</b> fields and is shown to be entirely consistent with known results. The method of calculating the correlation functions of twist fields provides a parametrisation of several other correlation functions for various quantum states. Since this method relies on the Ward identities found in a double copy model it is hoped to have wider applications in other free fermion models. Part II concerns the truncated conformal space approach which has been developed to approximate perturbed conformal field theories. In this part the theory underpinning the approach is discussed and a working algorithm is developed for both bulk and boundary perturbed minimal models. The energy levels, mass gaps and one point functions of various models are computed using the truncated conformal space approach and are shown {{to be in good}} agreement with previous calculations. A possible method for using this approach to approximate two point functions in perturbed conformal field theories is discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{shown that the}} b − c systems on a Riemann surface Σg of genus g and with abelian group of {{internal}} automorphisms Zn are equivalent to multivalued field theories on the complex plane C. To this purpose, the fields b and c are expanded using suitable bases of tensors that are multivalued on C and singlevalued on Σg. The amplitudes of the b − c systems on Σg are then recovered exploiting simple normal ordering rules on the complex plane. Finally, we construct a conformal field theory in C having as <b>primary</b> operators <b>twist</b> fields and free ghosts.

30|$|Spiral grain is {{a regular}} feature of many tree species, and {{remains one of the}} most {{important}} factors influencing wood utilisation (Denzler et al. 2015). However, the factors controlling its formation are poorly understood (Harris 1989; Kubler 1991; Skatter and Kučera 1997). Spiral grain angle (SGA) is defined as the orientation of wood fibres or tracheids with respect to the longitudinal axis of the tree stem (Kozlowski et al. 1967). Changes in the grain angle within stems are a well-known feature of old trees and of the corewood of conifers, and are normally attributed to pseudotransverse and anticlinal cell division in the vascular cambium (Bannan 1966; Larson 1994; Schulgasser and Witztum 2007).

40|$|A {{significant}} number of domestic and industrial boilers are in operation in Ukraine. Nitrogen oxides are the most dangerous among all combustion products that pollute the atmosphere, therefore, one should take some measures for decreasing the formation of nitrogen oxides during combustion. The {{studies were carried out}} at the boilers of low power (100 kW) with a tubular radiator and an open end. The studies in the furnaces of industrial steam boilers having a tubular radiator with a closed end have not been done. The numerical study results of the gaseous fuel combustion processes in the furnace of a DE- 10 / 14 steam water-tube boiler are presented. The fuel-air mixture is formed by premixing the 15 % part of the air with a <b>primary</b> burner <b>twist</b> factor n= 2. 4 and a secondary burner twist factor n= 1. 6, and an air excess factor αв= 10. As a result of the studies, the temperature and velocity distributions of gases in the combustion chamber, the density of heat flows on the screen tubular surfaces, and the concentrations of the combustion components were determined. Flue gas recirculation in the volume of 80 - 100 % is provided, and the reversible movement of combustion products towards the combustion front provides a reduction in the concentration of nitrogen oxides up to 123 - 125 mg/m 3 at the furnace outlet. Disadvantages are the following: the formation of stagnant zones {{near the end of the}} secondary radiator.

40|$|Data are {{provided}} {{for the evaluation of}} the aerodynamic performance of a series of twisted and cambered delta wings designed for a Mach number of 3. 5. Systematic force and pressure data are also presented for comparison with theory. Force tests were made at Mach numbers of 2. 3, 3. 0, 3. 5, 4. 0, and 4. 6. Design lift coefficients of 0. 0 and 0. 1 were employed on the 55 deg and 68 deg sweep wings, and design lift coefficients of 0. 0, 0. 05, and 0. 1 were employed on the 76 deg sweep wings. Pressure tests were conducted on the 55 deg and 76 deg sweep flat wings and on the 0. 1 design lift coefficient 76 deg sweep wing. The results indicate that for the sweep angles tested, an increase in the zero-lift pitching-moment coefficient is the <b>primary</b> benefit of <b>twist</b> and camber at a Mach number of 3. 5. Comparison of the experimental results with results obtained from several lift theories indicates that the Carlson-Middleton linear theory method gave the best overall agreement.

40|$|International audienceThe epithelial-mesenchymal {{transition}} (EMT) is an embryonic transdifferentiation process {{consisting of}} conversion of polarized epithelial cells to motile mesenchymal ones. EMT-inducing transcription factors are aberrantly expressed in multiple tumor types and {{are known to}} favor the metastatic dissemination process. Supporting oncogenic activity within <b>primary</b> lesions, the <b>TWIST</b> and ZEB proteins can prevent cells from undergoing oncogene-induced senescence and apoptosis by abolishing both p 53 - and RB-dependent pathways. Here we show that they also downregulate PP 2 A phosphatase activity and efficiently cooperate with an oncogenic version of H-RAS in malignant transformation of human mammary epithelial cells. Thus, by down-regulating crucial tumor suppressor functions, EMT inducers make cells particularly prone to malignant conversion. Importantly, by analyzing transformed cells generated in vitro and by characterizing novel transgenic mouse models, we further demonstrate that cooperation between an EMT inducer and an active form of RAS is sufficient to trigger transformation of mammary epithelial cells into malignant cells exhibiting all the characteristic features of claudin-low tumors, including low expression of tight and adherens junction genes, EMT traits, and stem cell-like characteristics. Claudin-low tumors {{are believed to be}} the most primitive breast malignancies, having arisen through transformation of an early epithelial precursor with inherent stemness properties and metaplastic features.

Methods: We examined the expressions of Twist and N-cadherin by immunohistochemistry in 120 cases of non-small cell lung cancer (including 68 cases with follow-up records). We also analyzed Twist 1 and N-cadherin mRNA expression in 30 non-small cell lung cancer tissues using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The functional roles of Twist 1 in lung cancer cell lines were evaluated by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of the protein followed by analyses of cell apoptosis and invasion.
