40|$|Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Diptera: Tephritidae) {{is a major}} horticultural {{insect pest}} in Australia which {{significantly}} limits domestic and international market access for Australian horticultural produce. Citrus {{is one of the}} industries seriously affected by the fruit fly problem in Australia. This research investigated the effect of citrus peel essential oil chemicals on B. tryoni larval survival in five different commercially important Citrus species and cultivars as a way of better understanding fruit susceptibility. The fruits used were Murcott mandarin, Navel orange, Eureka lemon, Valencia orange and yellow grapefruit. The essential oils of each citrus type were extracted using hydrodistillation and then mixed, at different concentrations, with artificial larval diets to which B. tryoni eggs were added. Surviving larvae were counted after five trial days. The same process was repeated for six essential oil components. Regression analysis of increasing oil concentration against larval survival showed that the crude oil blends of Navel orange, Eureka lemon and yellow grapefruit had significant negative effects on B. tryoni larval survival, but no such effects were seen for Murcott mandarin and Valencia orange. Of the individual essential oil fractions, only d-limonene had a significant effect on B. tryoni larval survival, with this chemical being highly toxic at very low concentrations. The results of this study open up opportunities for incorporating B. tryoni resistance mechanisms into citrus through minor <b>peel</b> <b>property</b> changes which would not impact on the eating attributes of the fruit...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the <b>peeling</b> <b>property</b> of the Weyl spinor for {{asymptotically}} (anti-) de Sitter spacetimes is guaranteed. In the case where there are Maxwell fields present, the <b>peeling</b> <b>properties</b> of both Weyl and Maxwell spinors similarly hold, if the leading order term of the spin coefficient ρ when expanded as inverse powers of r (where r is the usual spherical radial coordinate, and r→∞ is I) has coefficient - 1. This proof relies on a stipulation of the fall-offs for the unknown functions defining the null tetrad {{as well as the}} fall-offs of the spin coefficients for asymptotically (anti-) de Sitter spacetimes. If the cosmological constant is zero, then the <b>peeling</b> <b>property</b> {{does not appear to be}} guaranteed even with the stipulation of those fall-offs. Note that this approach is based on using the Newman-Penrose equations exclusively on the physical spacetime, i. e. we do not explicitly deal with conformal rescaling nor the conformal spacetime.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{specific}} peel system low-density polyethylene/isotactic poly-butene- 1 (PE-LD/iPB- 1), {{which is}} often used for protective packages, was investi-gated in this study. The required peel force to open the package depends {{on the content of}} iPB- 1 and on the processing conditions of the blowing process. Commer-cial products have a constant amount of iPB- 1. Thus, a defined peel force can be adjusted by varying the processing conditions. The standard peel system PE-LD with 6 wt % iPB- 1 was investigated in dependence on the processing conditions. The most important processing parameters of the processing line (extruder, die head, tube forming area) were varied and their influence on the <b>peel</b> <b>properties</b> was examined. For example the temperatures of the melt within the extruder, the size of the die gap within the die head, and the cooling behavior of the film bubble were investigated. Higher melt temperatures within the extruder decreased the peel force. The investigations also revealed a strong dependence of the peel force {{on the size of the}} die gap and on the degree of cooling. The new developed parameter time of solidification was used to characterize the cooling behavior.

40|$|This thesis explores two avenues into {{understanding}} {{the physics of}} black holes and horizons beyond general relativity, via analogue models and Lorentz violating theories. Analogue spacetimes have wildly different dynamics to general relativity; this allows the possibility of non-Killing horizons in stationary solutions. In the case of non-Killing horizons different definitions of surface gravity are truly different quantities. This also has application to modified theories of gravity, {{where there is no}} reason to expect all horizons to be Killing horizons. In Lorentz violating theories, the situation becomes even stranger, as Killing horizons are at best low energy barriers, but for superluminal dispersion relations a true causal barrier, the universal horizon, may be present. We investigate the nature of these universal horizons via a ray tracing study, and delve into what happens near both the universal and Killing horizons. From this study we determine the surface gravity of universal horizons by the <b>peeling</b> <b>properties</b> of rays near the horizon and discuss whether, and at what temperature these horizons radiate. Finally, we combine our investigations of universal horizons and analogue spacetimes, and ask why we have not seen a universal horizon in studies of analogue gravity.

Surface properties of leather fibres were altered (using a hydrophobic agent based on a phosphate ester) to more closely match those of the polymer. This resulted in a more even distribution of polymer on the leather fibrils. Application of the hydrophobic agent alone was investigated and optimum offers of the treatments determined. An untreated sample and one impregnated without surface treatment were included as controls.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{asymptotic}} solutions for spacetimes with non-zero cosmological constant Λ coupled to Maxwell fields, using the Newman-Penrose formalism. This extends a recent work {{that dealt with}} the vacuum Einstein (Newman-Penrose) equations with Λ≠ 0. The results are given in two different null tetrads: the Newman-Unti and Szabados-Tod null tetrads, where the <b>peeling</b> <b>property</b> is exhibited in the former but not the latter. Using these asymptotic solutions, we discuss the mass-loss of an isolated electro-gravitating system with cosmological constant. In a universe with Λ> 0, the physics of electromagnetic (EM) radiation is relatively straightforward compared to those of gravitational radiation: 1) It is clear that outgoing EM radiation results in a decrease to the Bondi mass of the isolated system. 2) It is also perspicuous that if any incoming EM radiation from elsewhere is present, those beyond the isolated system's cosmological horizon would eventually arrive at the spacelike I and increase the Bondi mass of the isolated system. Hence, the (outgoing and incoming) EM radiation fields do not couple with Λ in the Bondi mass-loss formula in an unusual manner, unlike the gravitational counterpart where outgoing gravitational radiation induces non-conformal flatness of I. These asymptotic solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell-de Sitter equations presented here {{may be used to}} extend a raft of existing results based on Newman-Unti's asymptotic solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations where Λ= 0, to now incorporate the cosmological constant Λ.

Methods: Pressure-sensitive adhesives with different concentrations of GA and LA were cast on a polyethylene terephthalate film. The patches were evaluated for peel adhesive strength. On the basis of in vitro adhesion properties the patches were selected for wear performance tests and skin irritation potential. Results: The adhesion properties (adhesion to steel plate and skin) and cohesive strength tests indicated the substantial influence of GA and LA concentrations. Based on in vitro adhesion studies the patches containing 3 &#x 0025; (w/w) GA were selected for in vivo studies. In vivo studies show that a formulation containing 3 &#x 0025; GA displays good adhesion on the skin, but it leaves little residues on the skin.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the suitability and properties of a quasi-Kinnersley tetrad and a geometrically motivated coordinate system as tools for quantifying both strong-field and wave-zone effects in numerical relativity (NR) simulations. We fix the radial and latitudinal coordinate {{degrees of freedom}} of the metric, using the Coulomb potential associated with the quasi-Kinnersley transverse frame. These coordinates are invariants of the spacetime {{and can be used}} to unambiguously fix the outstanding spin-boost freedom associated with the quasi-Kinnersley frame (resulting in a preferred quasi-Kinnersley tetrad (QKT)). In the limit of small perturbations about a Kerr spacetime, these coordinates and QKT reduce to Boyer-Lindquist coordinates and the Kinnersley tetrad, irrespective of the simulation gauge choice. We explore the properties of this construction both analytically and numerically, and we gain insights regarding the propagation of radiation described by a super-Poynting vector. We also quantify in detail the <b>peeling</b> <b>properties</b> of the chosen tetrad and gauge. We argue that these choices are particularly well suited for a rapidly converging wave-extraction algorithm as the extraction location approaches infinity, and we explore numerically the extent to which this property remains applicable on the interior of a computational domain. Using a number of additional tests, we verify that the prescription behaves as required in the appropriate limits regardless of simulation gauge. We explore the behavior of the geometrically motivated coordinate system in dynamical binary-black-hole NR mergers, and find them useful for visualizing features in NR simulations such as the spurious "junk" radiation.
