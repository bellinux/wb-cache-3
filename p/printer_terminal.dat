5000|$|In 1971, as IBM created IBM Japan Development Laboratory, Nobuo Mii {{became its}} Technical Operations director, working in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, {{and lead the}} project to develop IBM 3767 <b>printer</b> <b>terminal,</b> using the new Systems Network Architecture {{communications}} protocol.|$|E
50|$|IBM 3767 Communication Terminal is {{a serial}} <b>printer</b> <b>terminal</b> that {{employed}} wire matrix print-head technology and, {{for the first}} time, the Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) communications protocol set under IBM's Systems Network Architecture(SNA). It was introduced in 1974 and was used widely during the late 1970s to 1990s, for attachment to IBM System/360 and System/370 mainframe computers and IBM System/7 as a 2741 terminal.|$|E
50|$|During {{initial program}} load (IPL) of current MVS systems, the Nucleus Initialization Program (NIP) reads {{necessary}} information from the I/O Definition File (IODF) and uses it to build the UCBs. The UCBs are stored in system-owned memory, in the Extended System Queue Area (ESQA). After IPL completes, UCBs are owned by Input/Output Support. Some of the information stored in the UCB are: device type (disk, tape, <b>printer,</b> <b>terminal,</b> etc.), address of the device (such as 1002), subchannel identifier and device number, channel path ID (CHPID) which defines {{the path to the}} device, for some devices the volume serial number (VOLSER), and a large amount of other information, including OS Job Management data.|$|E
5000|$|Print {{services}} provide centralized {{background printing}} on <b>terminal</b> <b>printers,</b> line <b>printers,</b> or <b>Terminal</b> Server <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1973, Millard founded IMS Associates, {{which is}} most famous for IMSAI 8080 {{microcomputer}} first shipped in late 1975. By 1977, IMSAI's product line included <b>printers,</b> <b>terminals,</b> floppy diskettes and software. To finance rapidly growing operations, IMSAI pledged 20% of its stock as convertible note in exchange for $250,000 from investment firm Marriner & Co.|$|R
50|$|Because the new {{minicomputer}} systems required inexpensive operator consoles (compared to teletype <b>printers),</b> the <b>terminals</b> {{became a}} success.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1960 and 1970s, the {{computing}} environment expanded beyond the large computer rooms based on card input/output {{and started to}} allow data input and output terminals from remote locations. For such purposes, <b>printer</b> <b>terminals</b> such as IBM 2741 printer, using the traditional asynchronous serial communication (start-stop signaling), and display terminals such as IBM 2260 and IBM 3270, using the new communications protocol set (Binary Synchronous Communications or BSC), became available.|$|R
2500|$|Unix had a {{drastically}} simplified {{file model}} compared to many contemporary operating systems: treating {{all kinds of}} files as simple byte arrays. The file system hierarchy contained machine services and devices (such as <b>printers,</b> <b>terminals,</b> or disk drives), providing a uniform interface, but {{at the expense of}} occasionally requiring additional mechanisms such as ioctl and mode flags to access features of the hardware that did not fit the simple [...] "stream of bytes" [...] model. The Plan 9 operating system pushed this model even further and eliminated the need for additional mechanisms.|$|R
50|$|Use CNFIGSSP {{to place}} devices on the line/address map; {{identify}} the particular IBM <b>printer</b> or <b>terminal</b> model; assign {{characteristics such as}} console, alternate console, subconsole; and to name the printer's subconsole.|$|R
5000|$|... nroff (short for [...] "new roff") is a Unix text-formatting program. It {{produces}} output {{suitable for}} simple fixed-width <b>printers</b> and <b>terminal</b> windows. It {{is an integral}} part of the Unix help system, being used to format man pages for display.|$|R
50|$|DECserver 708This {{model was}} {{designed}} to replace the DECserver 700-08 and was introduced in 2003. It connects devices (such as <b>printers,</b> <b>terminals,</b> PCs, and modems) to local area networks (LANs). The DECserver 708 is Ethernet-based and supports 10BaseT Ethernet directly, and ThinWire Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 through an adapter. It supports Flash RAM capability and other nonvolatile forms of memory. The memory capability is factory installed. The Flash RAM is optional. The DECserver 708 can download the software image from the network or from the Flash RAM option if installed. The Flash RAM option allows for a boot/power up without having to download the image through the network. The DECserver 708 supports up to 4 MB of memory.|$|R
5000|$|The Teletype Dataspeed 40 {{combined}} electronic CRTs {{and high}} speed <b>printer</b> <b>terminals</b> and were networked {{in many different}} applications {{through the use of}} [...] "cluster controllers" [...] and digital data service units. The Dataspeed 40 interfaced a synchronous modem usually running at 2400, 4800 or 9600 baud. The trademarked term [...] "Dataspeed" [...] originated with a series of high speed paper tape terminals that sent and received oil-treated punched paper tape at 1050 words per minute. AT&T used the Dataspeed 40 terminals internally for their Switching Control Center System and similar purposes. The Dataspeed 40 was also sold commercially and used for a variety of purposes and displaced some older and slower speed Teletype equipment.|$|R
25|$|Printer Redirection {{allows users}} to use their local <b>printer</b> within the <b>terminal</b> session as they would with a locally- or network-shared printer.|$|R
50|$|It {{is mainly}} written in Python with some modules written in C. It has a {{graphical}} frontend {{that is based}} on GTK+ 3/PyGObject and designed with the Glade Interface Designer. Anaconda also has a custom text frontend with support for computers with line <b>printer</b> like <b>terminals,</b> such as the IBM ESA/390 mainframes.|$|R

50|$|External {{interfaces}} on {{the bare}} board were often limited to a single RS-232 or current loop serial port, so a <b>terminal,</b> <b>printer,</b> or Teletype could be connected.|$|R
50|$|CNFIGSSP is used {{to place}} devices on the line/address map; {{identify}} the particular IBM <b>printer</b> or <b>terminal</b> model; assign characteristics such as console, alternate console, subconsole; and to name the printer's subconsole. To apply CNFIGSSP, the system must be dedicated (no other users logged on or programs running.) The system must then be IPLed (rebooted.) When IPL finishes, the newly configured devices {{will appear on the}} status display.|$|R

50|$|The first {{microprocessors}} {{emerged in}} the early 1970s, and were used for electronic calculators, using binary-coded decimal (BCD) arithmetic on 4-bit words. Other embedded uses of 4-bit and 8-bit microprocessors, such as <b>terminals,</b> <b>printers,</b> various kinds of automation etc., followed soon after. Affordable 8-bit microprocessors with 16-bit addressing also led to the first general-purpose microcomputers from the mid-1970s on.|$|R
5000|$|By 1994 the [...] "3174 Establishment Controller" [...] {{supported}} {{features such}} as attachment to multiple hosts via token ring, Ethernet, or X.25 {{in addition to the}} standard channel attach or SDLC, and terminal attachment via twisted pair, token ring or Ethernet in addition to co-ax. They also supported attachment of asynchronous ASCII <b>terminals,</b> <b>printers,</b> and plotters alongside 3270 devices.|$|R
50|$|The 2922-2 <b>Terminal</b> <b>Printer</b> (RPQ 810564) was a repackaged 1403 printer. The printer used a {{print chain}} and {{provided}} a page width of 132 characters using fanfold paper.

This paper examines those costs in an effort to produce a more realistic picture of an automated system...|$|R
50|$|S is one {{of several}} {{statistical}} computing languages that were designed at Bell Laboratories, and first took form between 1975-1976. Up to that time, much of the statistical computing was done by directly calling Fortran subroutines; however, S was designed to offer an alternate and more interactive approach. Early design decisions that hold even today include interactive graphics devices (<b>printers</b> and character <b>terminals</b> at the time), and providing easily accessible documentation for the functions.|$|R
50|$|The Modified Modular Jack (MMJ) {{is a small}} {{form-factor}} {{serial port}} connector developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It uses {{a modified version of}} the 6P6C modular connector with the latch displaced off-center so standard modular connectors found on Ethernet cables or phone jacks cannot accidentally be plugged in. MMJ connections are used on Digital minicomputers, such as the PDP-11, VAX and Alpha systems, and to connect <b>terminals,</b> <b>printers,</b> and serial console servers.|$|R
5000|$|Software {{flow control}} is used {{extensively}} by low-speed devices, especially older <b>printers</b> and dumb <b>terminals,</b> to indicate they are temporarily unable to accept more data. Typically, {{this is due}} to a combination of limited output rate and any buffers being full. Some terminal control packages, such as termcap, employ [...] "padding" [...] (short delays using millisecond granularity) to allow such equipment sufficient time to perform the requested actions without the need to assert XOFF.|$|R
