Routine histology of liver samples collected at necropsy from 19 of 20 (95 %) western barred bandicoots revealed the sporadic to common occurrence of abnormal hepatocyte nuclei characterized by margination of chromatin and concomitant central pallor. Some abnormal hepatocyte nuclei were mildly to markedly enlarged and irregularly shaped. Periodic acid-Schiff reagent stained 131 of 142 (92 %) of these abnormal hepatocyte nuclei. Positive staining was completely eliminated by diastase pretreatment. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that abnormal hepatocyte nuclei with marginated chromatin {{did not contain}} viral particles.

Captive-bred western barred bandicoots <b>Perameles</b> <b>bougainville</b> and bilbies Macrotis lagotis were exposed to a model hawk or a stuffed cat to determine their level of recognition and response to these predators. Both species responded to the avian predator (hawk). M. lagotis showed stronger responses involving running or adopting an alert posture, while P. bougainville responded with altered walking behaviour. M. lagotis were also exposed to a stuffed cat. They showed an increase in running behaviour in response to this exotic mammalian predator. The level of response for both species was neither rapid nor vigorous, providing little confidence in their effective response to predators if released back in to the wild.

40|$|AbstractThe genome {{of a novel}} virus, {{tentatively}} named bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 2 (BPCV 2), {{obtained from}} multicentric papillomatous lesions from an adult male southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) was sequenced in its entirety. BPCV 2 had a circular double-stranded DNA genome consisting of 7277  bp and open reading frames encoding putative L 1 and L 2 structural proteins and putative large T antigen and small t antigen transforming proteins. These genomic features, intermediate between Papillomaviridae and Polyomaviridae are most similar to BPCV 1, recently described from papillomas and carcinomas in the endangered western barred bandicoot (<b>Perameles</b> <b>bougainville).</b> This study also employed in situ hybridization to definitively demonstrate BPCV 2 DNA within lesion biopsies.

40|$|The western barred {{bandicoot}} (<b>Perameles</b> <b>bougainville)</b> is {{an endangered}} Australian marsupial species in which a papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome occurs. Bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 1 (BPCV 1) {{is associated with the}} lesions of this progressively debilitating syndrome. Five digoxigenin-labelled DNA probes were generated for in situ hybridization (ISH) and the technique was optimized and performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies. Staining of keratinocyte and sebocyte nuclei within lesions was achieved with all five probes. The sensitivity of ISH (76. 9  %) surpassed that of PCR (30. 8  %) for FFPE samples. The sensitivity of ISH varied from 81  % (papillomas) and 70  % (carcinoma in situ) to 29  % (squamous cell carcinomas). The specificity of the test was confirmed using an irrelevant probe and papillomas from other species.

40|$|The western barred {{bandicoot}} (<b>Perameles</b> <b>bougainville)</b> is {{an endangered}} species, free ranging on only two islands {{off the coast of}} Western Australia (Dorre and Bernier Islands). Conservation efforts are currently directed at reintroducing these marsupials into predator-proof enclosures and habitats in historical distribution ranges on the mainland in the southwest of Western Australia and in South Australia. In September 2000, 19 {{western barred bandicoot}}s were captured on Bernier Island for translocation, and 11 of these had evidence of {{at least one of the}} following eye conditions: corneal opacity, conjunctivitis, ocular discharge, and blepharitis. Five bandicoots were examined, and conjunctival and cloacal swabs were collected. Polymerase chain reaction for Chlamydiales was positive in four ban-dicoots. Four Chlamydiales types were identified by gene sequencing, including a strain of Chlamydia pecorum different from strains previously found in koalas and several new Chlamydiales genotypes.

40|$|Natural {{populations of}} the {{endangered}} western barred bandicoot (<b>Perameles</b> <b>bougainville)</b> now exist on only two islands in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Our aim was to investigate genetic diversity in natural, reintroduced, and captive {{populations of the}} bandicoots and to assess the extent of divergence between the populations. The contemporary isolation of the natural populations has resulted in heterogeneity of allele frequency between the islands, which has acted to maintain a higher combined diversity than would be expected from either population on its own. These findings highlight how remnant island populations can act as genetic reservoirs to maximize diversity for reintroductions into a species former range. Although diversity is high between island populations, diversity within populations, based on six microsatellite loci, are amongst the lowest ever recorded for populations of marsupials. The mtDNA sequence data indicate that the two remaining natural populations show only minor divergence from each other, with the five haplotypes separated by just single base pairs.

Klossiella quimrensis is the etiologic agent of renal coccidiosis in the peramelid marsupial hosts Isoodon obesulus and Perameles gunnii in Eastern Australia, {{but there is no}} previous report of klossiellosis in Western Australian peramelids. This study describes klossiellosis diagnosed by histology of renal tissue sections collected during necropsy of 20 <b>Perameles</b> <b>bougainville</b> between 2000 and 2005. Sporonts, sporoblasts, and macrogametes were identified within parasitophorous vacuoles of epithelial cells located near the renal corticomedullary junction. The prevalence of renal coccidiosis in P. bougainville diagnosed by renal histology is estimated at 30 %. Only a single unsporulated sporocyst was detected by examination of cystocentesis-collected urine, indicating that microscopic evaluation of urine samples is an insensitive diagnostic test for detection of K. quimrensis in P. bougainville.

40|$|Fleas are {{important}} arthropod vectors {{for a variety}} of diseases in veterinary and human medicine, and bacteria belonging to the genus Bartonella are among the organisms most commonly transmitted by these ectoparasites. Recently, a number of novel Bartonella species and novel species candidates have been reported in marsupial fleas in Australia. In the present study the genetic diversity of marsupial fleas was investigated; 10 species of fleas were collected from seven different marsupial and placental mammal hosts in Western Australia including woylies (Bettongia penicillata), western barred bandicoots (<b>Perameles</b> <b>bougainville),</b> mardos (Antechinus flavipes), bush rats (Rattus fuscipes), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), feral cats (Felis catus) and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). PCR and sequence analysis of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and the 18 S rRNA genes from these fleas was performed. Concatenated phylogenetic analysis of the COI and 18 S rRNA genes revealed a close genetic relationship between marsupial fleas, with Pygiopsylla hilli from woylies, Pygiopsylla tunneyi from western barred bandicoots and Acanthopsylla jordani from mardos, forming a separate cluster from fleas collected from the placental mammals in the same geographical area.

One of 13 tick samples and 1 of 12 P. bougainville fecal samples were positive for C. burnetii DNA using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. DNA fragments had > 99 % similarity to published C. burnetii sequences. Three of 35 P. bougainville sera tested positive for anti-C. burnetii antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. C. burnetii was found in P. bougainville feces and a H. humerosa tick on Dorre Island and Bernier Island, respectively.

40|$|A {{putative}} novel papillomavirus {{has been}} implicated in a debilitating papillomatosis–carcinomatosis syndrome affecting endangered Western barred bandicoots (<b>Perameles</b> <b>bougainville).</b> Multiply-rimed rolling circle amplification was employed to amplify circular DNA from lesional tissue. This was subsequently used to deduce viral genetic sequences. DNA probes were generated for the L 1, L 2 (major and minor capsid proteins) and large T-antigen-like (putative oncoprotein) open reading frames. A genomic probe was also constructed from the entire viral genome, randomly cut into fragments. These probes were labelled by nick translation with digoxigenin and annealed probes were detected using antidigoxigenin alkaline phosphatise-conjugated F(ab) 2 fragments and visualized with exposure to precipitating BM Purple alkaline phosphatase substrate solution (all reagents for in situ hybridization: Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity, which was especially prominent in apocrine sweat gland tissue, was blocked with levamisole. There was positive nuclear staining of keratinocytes and sebocytes in lesional biopsies from wart-affected Western barred bandicoots sampled between 2000 and 2006 for all DNA probes tested. Overfixation, freezing and autolysis all reduced the sensitivity and specificity of this technique; however, with optimally fixed, well-preserved tissue samples, positive staining was obvious and reliable.

40|$|Conservation {{efforts to}} prevent the {{extinction}} of the endangered western barred bandicoot <b>Perameles</b> <b>bougainville</b> (WBB) are currently hindered by a debilitating progressive papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome. Now extinct on mainland Australia, wild populations of the WBB are known only to exist on Bernier and Dorre Islands in Shark Bay, Western Australia. This thesis describes and analyses the pathological (gross, histological, ultrastructural) and immunohistochemical features of a papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome in the WBB. The detection and characterisation of a novel virus, the bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 1 (BPCV 1), found in association with cutaneous and muco-cutaneous papillomas and carcinomas, is described. BPCV 1 was found to exhibit genomic and morphological features of both the Papillomaviridae and the Polyomaviridae, and may represent {{the first member of}} a new family of viruses. The findings of this study provide evidence that BPCV 1 is the causative agent of the papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome. Clinical, pathological and molecular evidence of the syndrome and BPCV 1 were found in the Bernier Island WBB population at Red Cliff and in captive populations comprising all or a proportion of founder WBBs from this site, but not at all in the WBB population on Dorre Island or Heirisson Prong.

40|$|Variation at genetic {{regions of}} {{functional}} significance {{is a new}} focus in conservation genetics. One of the prime candidates for such studies is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This gene region, with its critical role in immune response in vertebrates, {{is thought to have}} a significant impact on population fitness. The screening of diversity at MHC regions in non-model organisms presents a number of challenges that need to be overcome before its widespread incorporation into conservation programs. Here we present an approach and data for the screening of diversity at a class II MHC locus in wild and captive populations of the western barred bandicoot (<b>Perameles</b> <b>bougainville).</b> Primers developed to amplify the DAB gene in the tammar wallaby were modified to amplify the same gene in western barred bandicoots. Alleles were identified by cloning and sequencing of PCR products. Screening of all populations was carried out via high resolution melt analysis (HRM) and revealed just two sequence copies for this gene present in every individual from all populations. Alignment of translated amino acid sequences show that these variants contain many conserved elements indicative of functional MHC class II genes and suggest that they represent separate duplicated loci. Such a low level of MHC diversity is surprising for wild mammalian populations and exposes this species to increased vulnerability to novel disease pathogens.

Fleas, ticks and larval trombiculid mites (chiggers) {{were collected from}} bandicoots and their handling bags and preserved in ethanol. Chiggers were mounted and cleared in Hoyer’s medium. Fleas were boiled in potassium hydroxide, dehydrated through graded alcohols, cleared in methyl salicylate and mounted with Canada balsam. Ticks were identified using a dissecting microscope. Schoutedenichia emphyla chiggers were found on periscrotal, peripouch and aural skin in many P. bougainville from Dryandra. The ticks Haemaphysalis humerosa and H. ratti were collected from Bernier and Dorre Islands. In all, four flea species have been identified on P. bougainville. Echidnophaga gallinacea and Pygiopsylla tunneyi were common at Heirisson Prong and the Islands colonies, respectively.

40|$|Background: The western barred bandicoot, <b>Perameles</b> <b>bougainville,</b> is an {{endangered}} Australian marsupial species whose survival {{is threatened by}} a papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome. Investigations to characterize this syndrome would benefit from species-specific clinical chemistry data. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine plasma biochemical reference values and to determine enzyme activities in various tissues of P. bougainville. Methods: Heparinized blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture from 53 clinically healthy bandicoots of both sexes and at 3 geographic locations. Plasma was analyzed for routine clinical chemistry variables using an automated biochemistry analyzer. Tissues obtained following humane euthanasia of 3 bandicoots were analyzed for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatine kinase (CK), alpha-amylase (AML), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activities. Results: Significant differences in the results were found for animals based on geographic location and sex; hence, results were expressed as minimum and maximum values. A population reference interval was calculated for AST activity (20 - 283 U/L). ALT was found mainly in the liver, with lower levels in cardiac and skeletal muscle and kidneys. AST was detectable in many tissues, including the heart, liver, kidneys, and central nervous system; CK was found in skeletal and cardiac muscle and central nervous system; AML was found in the pancreas; and GGT was found mainly in kidneys with lower levels in the intestines and pancreas.

Sequencing of the BPCV 1 genome revealed a novel prototype virus exhibiting genomic properties of both the Papillomaviridae and the Polyomaviridae. Papillomaviral properties included a large genome size (~ 7. 3 kb) {{and the presence of}} open reading frames (ORFs) encoding canonical L 1 and L 2 structural proteins. The genomic organization in which structural and nonstructural proteins were encoded on different strands of the double-stranded genome and the presence of ORFs encoding the nonstructural proteins large T and small t antigens were, on the other hand, typical polyomaviral features. BPCV 1 may represent the first member of a novel virus family, descended from a common ancestor of the papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses recognized today. Alternatively, it may represent the product of ancient recombination between members of these two virus families. The discovery of this virus could have implications for the current taxonomic classification of Papillomaviridae and Polyomaviridae and can provide further insight into the evolution of these ancient virus families.

40|$|Chlamydophila pneumoniae is an obligate {{intracellular}} respiratory pathogen {{that has}} been associated with pneumonia and chronic bronchitis, atherosclerosis, asthma and other chronic diseases in humans. However, C. pneumoniae is not restricted to humans, as originally thought, and can cause infections in several animal hosts. C. pneumoniae was isolated in cell culture from nine Western barred bandicoots (<b>Perameles</b> <b>bougainville)</b> from Australia. The sequences of five genomic regions were determined, including full-length sequences of the 16 S rRNA and ompA genes and the ygeD-urk intergenic spacer, and partial sequences of the 23 S rRNA and rpoB genes. Sequence analysis of the entire 16 S rRNA and ompA genes from bandicoot isolates demonstrated that they were 98. 2 - 98. 3 % similar to human isolates, 94. 6 - 99. 3 % similar to the equine biovar and almost identical, with 99. 5 - 99. 9 % similarity, to the koala biovar. Comparative genotyping of the variable domain 4 region of the ompA gene demonstrated that bandicoot isolates seemed to be identical to the animal genotype {{that has been}} recently identified in human carotid plaque specimens. Minor sequence polymorphism observed in ompA, 16 S rRNA and rpoB genes of animal isolates, indicating genomic diversity within C. pneumoniae, may have important implications for diagnostic PCR assays leading to false negative results. Forty percent of selected published species-specific PCR assays were found to have sequence variability in primer and/or probe that might affect their performance in detecting bandicoot isolates of C. pneumoniae, or possibly other animal and human strains where minor sequence polymorphisms may be present. The data from this study support the previous observations that C. pneumoniae is not restricted to humans and may be widespread in an animal reservoir with a potential risk of transmission to humans...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{prevalence}} and genetic diversity of Bartonella species in various arthropod vectors from both wild and domestic animals in Australia were investigated using nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA). Previous studies on Bartonella species in Australia have {{been confined to}} mammalian hosts, including humans, cats, native rodents and eastern grey kangaroos. However, {{little is known about}} the status of bartonellae in arthropod vectors, which is essential in understanding the transmission dynamics of the organisms. To facilitate the investigation, ectoparasites (ticks and fleas) were collected from both wild and domestic animals from various locations in Australia. All ectoparasites were screened for Bartonella species using newly designed nested-PCRs targeting the gltA gene (citrate synthase) and the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, developed as part of the present study. Multilocus sequence analysis of the 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), citrate synthase (gltA),cell division protein (ftsZ) and RNA polymerasebeta-subunit (rpoB) genes and the ribosomal ITS region was applied to identify and confirm the status of all Bartonella species identified in this study. Multilocus sequence analysis of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes of flea vectors harbouring a diversity of Bartonella species were analysed to characterize the extent of genetic diversity in the flea vectors and to elucidate vector-parasite associations. A phylogenetic analysis of the 5 concatenated loci identified 3 novel Bartonella species in flea vectors from marsupials in Western Australia. Candidatus Bartonella antechini was detected in fleas (Acanthopsylla jordani) from mardos (Antechinus flavipes - also called the yellow-footed antechinus). Candidatus Bartonella woyliei was detected in fleas (Pygiopsylla hilli), from brush-tailed bettongs (Bettongia penicillata– also called woylies), and Candidatus Bartonella bandicootii was detected in Pygiopsylla tunneyi fleas from western barred bandicoots (<b>Perameles</b> <b>bougainville).</b> Furthermore, a potential novel species, Bartonella sp. strain WC 2 was detected in ticks (Ixodes australiensis) from woylies based on the criterion of a genetic similarity of less than 96...|$|R
40|$|Population structure, reproduction, condition, {{movements}} and habitat preference were assessed for western barred bandicoots (<b>Perameles</b> <b>bougainville)</b> on Dorre and Bernier Islands over seven trapping sessions between 1988 and 1995. Data comes from 372 captures of bandicoots in 2535 trap-nights (an average of 14 · 7 captures per 100 trap-nights). Trap success was 5. 7 – 25. 8 % on Dorre and 5. 7 – 7. 6 % on Bernier. Recaptures within a trip made up 29 % of bandicoot captures. The overall sex ratio (excluding recaptures) was skewed heavily towards males at 1. 7 : 1 for trapped animals, but varied {{between male and}} female dominance at any time according to reproductive status of females. Sex ratio of pouch young was 1. 2 : 1. Production of young was concentrated in the wetter winter months. The smallest western barred bandicoot with pouch young weighed 175 g. Bandicoots showed a pattern of increasing litter size with size of mother. Females with young had an average litter size of 1. 8, with young reaching independence at about 100 g body weight. Large testes size relative to body size in males suggested a promiscuous mating system. Body condition could be predicted by sex (females were typically in better condition than males) and by rainfall over the previous 2 months. Some sexual dimorphism was evident, with females having longer heads and typically being heavier than males. There was no detected dimorphism between island populations. Movements of bandicoots appeared limited, with the median distance moved by animals captured more than once within a 9 – 11 -day trapping session being 154 m. There {{was no significant difference in}} movements between the sexes, with males moving a median distance of 160 m and females 138 m within trapping sessions. The greatest movement by a male was 1020 m while the greatest distance moved by a female was 490 m. Only 13 % of recorded movements were greater than 400 m. Home ranges overlapped, with 51 % of traps catching more than one individual and as many as five males being caught at the same trap site. Bandicoots were widely dispersed through all habitats surveyed. Bandicoots appeared to suffer a substantial reduction in numbers on Dorre Island in a prolonged drought extending from October 1986 to April 1989, reducing overall trap success to less than 6 % in the 1988 survey...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} a decade, {{community}} groups, scientific organizations and government agencies have collaborated to repopulate the endangered western barred bandicoot (<b>Perameles</b> <b>bougainville).</b> While initially successful, the unexpected discovery of a papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome in captive and wild populations of P. bougainville exposed a dearth of knowledge regarding their diseases. This dissertation addresses this issue through study of the clinical pathology, immunology, parasitology, and virology of P. bougainville. To facilitate the detection and understanding of diseases in P. bougainville, guidelines for interpreting haematology and clinical chemistry results were developed, including calculated species-specific reference intervals for plasma aspartate transaminase activity (20 - 283 U/L), haemoglobin (122 - 165 g/L), haematocrit (0. 36 - 0. 49 L/L), total leukocytes (2. 9 - 14. 9 x 10 ^ 9 /L), monocytes (0 - 0. 6 x 10 ^ 9 /L), eosinophils (0 - 0. 9 x 10 ^ 9 /L) and total protein (47 - 63 g/L) estimated by refractometry. P. bougainville immunoglobulin was also fractionated from plasma and inoculated into sheep to derive antiserum for serological screening assays. Arthropods, helminths and protozoa parasitic on P. bougainville were catalogued and Eimeria kanyana n. sp. was formally described. The pathogenic and zoonotic potential of bacteria detected in ticks parasitic on P. bougainville was also considered. The association between bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 1 (BPCV 1) and the western barred bandicoot papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome was investigated using PCR, in situ hybridization and virus isolation. Optimized in situ hybridization techniques demonstrated BPCV 1 DNA within keratinocyte and sebocyte nuclei, and BPCV 1 mRNA within the cytoplasm. BPCV 1 virions were isolated by ultracentrifugation and visualized with negative stain transmission electron microscopy revealing icosahedral, non-enveloped viral capsids 47 nm in diameter, comparable to viruses classified within Papillomaviridae and Polyomaviridae. A novel virus, tentatively named bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 2 (BPCV 2) was discovered in papillomatous lesions from a southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus). It had a circular double-stranded DNA genome of 7277 bp, and encoded two papillomavirus-like structural proteins, L 1 and L 2, and two polyomavirus-like putative transforming proteins, large T antigen and small t antigen. DNA and RNA in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of BPCV 2 nucleic acids within lesion biopsies. The discovery of the bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis viruses has provoked reassessment of the established virus taxonomy paradigm, theories of virus-host co-speciation and bandicoot population management strategies...|$|R
