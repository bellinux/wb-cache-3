40|$|Abstract Despite the {{infinitely}} {{many ways}} to grasp a spherical object, regularities have been observed in the posture of the arm and the grasp orientation. In the present study, {{we set out to}} determine the factors that predict the grasp orientation and the final joint angles of reach-tograsp movements. Subjects made reach-to-grasp movements toward a sphere to pick it up and place it at an indicated location. We varied the position of the sphere and the starting and placing positions. Multiple regression analysis showed that the sphere’s azimuth from the subject was the best predictor of grasp orientation, although there were also smaller but reliable contributions of distance, starting position, and perhaps even <b>placing</b> <b>position.</b> The sphere’s initial distance from the subject was the best predictor of the final elbow angle and shoulder elevation. A combination of the sphere’s azimuth and distance from the subject was required to predict shoulder angle, trunkhead rotation, and lateral head position. The starting position best predicted the final wrist angle and sagittal head position. We conclude that the final posture of the arm when grasping a sphere to place it elsewhere is determined to a larger extend by the initial position of the object than by effects of starting and <b>placing</b> <b>position...</b>|$|E

40|$|Drawing {{inspiration}} from Dirac's work on functions of non-commuting observables, we develop {{an approach to}} phase-space descriptions of operators and the Wigner-Weyl correspondence in quantum mechanics, complementary to standard formulations. This involves a two-step process: introducing phase-space descriptions based on <b>placing</b> <b>position</b> dependences {{to the left of}} momentum dependences (or the other way around); then carrying out a natural transformation to eliminate a kernel which appears in the expression for the trace of the product of two operators. The method works uniformly for both continuous Cartesian degrees of freedom and for systems with finite-dimensional state spaces. It is interesting that the kernel encountered is naturally expressible in terms of geometric phases, and its removal involves extracting its square root in a suitable manner...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{works have}} widely studied relay-aided {{underwater}} acoustic networks under some specialized relay distributions, e. g., equidistant and rectangular-grid. In this paper, we investigate two fundamental problems that under which conditions a relay should be deployed {{and where to}} deploy it if necessary {{in terms of the}} energy and delay performance in linear underwater acoustic networks. To address these two problems, we first accurately approximate the complicated effective bandwidth and transmit power in the logarithm domain to formulate an energy minimization problem. By analyzing the formulation, we discover a critical transmission distance, defined as open distance, and explicitly show that a relay should not be deployed if the transmission distance is less than the open distance and should be otherwise. Most importantly, we derive a closed-form and easy-to-calculate expression for the open distance and also strictly prove that the optimal <b>placing</b> <b>position</b> is at the middle point of the link when a relay should be introduced. Moreover, although this paper considers a linear two-hop relay network as the first step, our derived results can be applied to construct energy-efficient and delay-friendly multi-hop networks. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and show that properly introducing a relay can dramatically reduce the network energy consumption almost without increasing the end-to-end delay.

Studied were {{correlation between the}} number of spikeIets and kernels and their <b>placing</b> <b>position</b> in a spike and spikelet, and the grain weight from three spike size groups. The number of productive spikelets per spike and fertility of inflorescence per spikelet, measured as a number of kernels, were the biggest in big spikes group. Kernels placed in positions 1 and 2 in a kernel had the biggest mass, whereas the kernels developed from the inflorescence in positions 3 and 4 were conspicuous for their smaller mass, particularly in the small and medium-size spike groups. The analysis of correlation coefficient values revealed that grain weight per spike was strongly correlated with the number of kernels per spike in all determined size classes. Also a significant effect of single kemel weight on yield per spike was noticed, but the coefficient value was lower (r= 0. 30). Spikelets in positions from 3 to 7 level (on both sides of spike) had the greatest share in grain weight per spike for the smallest spike group, whereas for medium- size and big spikes respectively spikelets in positions 3 through 9 and 2 through 10...|$|E
