5|$|Edward Norton {{flew out}} to Austin and met Malick, {{who had been}} {{impressed}} by the actor's screen test for Primal Fear. Matthew McConaughey reportedly took a day off filming A Time to Kill to see Malick. Others followed, including William Baldwin, Edward Burns, Josh Hartnett, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Stephen Dorff, and Leonardo DiCaprio; the latter flew up from the Mexico set of Romeo + Juliet to meet Malick at the American Airlines lounge in the Austin airport. Before the casting was finalized, Nicolas Cage had lunch with Malick in Hollywood in February 1996. Malick went off to scout locations and tried calling Cage that summer {{only to find out}} that his phone number had been disconnected. Tom Sizemore, however, was offered a more substantial role in Saving Private Ryan and, when he could not contact Malick for several days, decided to do Steven Spielberg's film instead. Actors Bill Pullman, Mickey Rourke, and Lukas Haas filmed scenes for the movie but were cut from the final film due to time contraints. <b>Publicity</b> <b>stills</b> of Pullman (as Sgt. MacTae, in a scene opposite Brody and Chaplin) can be seen online, Haas is pictured in the booklet of the CD soundtrack, and one of Rourke's scenes was restored for the Criterion Blu-Ray/DVD release of the film.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 24, Scott's billing and {{portrait}} {{were equal}} to Bogart's on the film's lobby posters and in advertisements. Most often portrayed in <b>publicity</b> <b>stills</b> was the Jean Louis gown-and-glove outfit worn in the nightclub scene, the most iconic gown Scott wore in her entire film career (see publicity still above). In September 1946, a Motion Picture Herald poll of exhibitors voted her the seventh-most promising [...] "star of tomorrow." [...] Production ran 10 June–4 September 1946. It premiered in New York the week of 23 January 1947. Despite the initial positive publicity, the long-term effect of Dead Reckoning was to typecast the former comedian for her entire career. The following year, contrary to general expectations, Bacall herself approved of the casting of Scott in Dead Reckoning.|$|E
