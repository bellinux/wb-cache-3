25|$|Low <b>pressure</b> <b>operation.</b> Because {{the coolant}} salts remain liquid at high temperatures, LFTR cores are {{designed}} to operate at low pressures, like 0.6 MPa (comparable to the pressure in the drinking water system) from the pump and hydrostatic pressure. Even if the core fails, there is little increase in volume. Thus the containment building cannot blow up. LFTR coolant salts are chosen to have very high boiling points. Even a several hundred degree heatup during a transient or accident does not cause a meaningful pressure increase. There is no water or hydrogen in the reactor that can cause a large pressure rise or explosion as happened during the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident.|$|E
2500|$|Highly {{questionable}} economics - although {{proponents of}} LFTR technology list {{a wide variety}} of claimed economic advantages, detailed studies of their economics invariably conclude there is no real advantage in overall terms. A number of the claims, like the ambient <b>pressure</b> <b>operation</b> and high-temperature cooling loops, are already used on a number of conventional designs and have failed to produce the economic gains claimed. In other cases, there is simply not enough data to justify any conclusion. When the entire development is considered, the conclusions are invariably {{something along the lines of}} one report's summary: [...] "... the difference in cost, given the current industry environment, remains insufficient to justify the creation of a new LFTR." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{isentropic}} {{efficiency of}} scroll compressors is {{slightly higher than}} that of a typical reciprocating compressor when the compressor is designed to operate near one selected rating point. The scroll compressors are more efficient in this case because {{they do not have a}} dynamic discharge valve that introduces additional throttling losses. However, the efficiency of a scroll compressor that does not have a discharge valve begins to decrease as compared to the reciprocating compressor at higher <b>pressure</b> ratio <b>operation.</b> This is a result of under-compression losses that occur at high <b>pressure</b> ratio <b>operation</b> of the positive displacement compressors that do not have a dynamic discharge valve.|$|R
50|$|Combined {{heat and}} power systems are very useful systems in which wood waste, such as wood chips, {{is used to}} {{generate}} power, and heat is created as a byproduct of the power generation system. They {{have a very high}} cost because of the high <b>pressure</b> <b>operation.</b> Because of this high <b>pressure</b> <b>operation,</b> the need for a highly trained operator is mandatory, and will raise the cost of operation. Another drawback is that while they produce electricity they will produce heat, and if producing heat is not desirable for certain parts of the year, the addition of a cooling tower is necessary, and will also raise the cost.|$|E

40|$|Slug flow is {{commonly}} observed in gas production offshore fields. At high <b>operation</b> <b>pressure</b> only short hydrodynamic slugs are observed. However, as the offshore fields become older, the <b>operation</b> <b>pressure</b> becomes lower and long slugs may form. At near atmospheric pressures the long slugs may reach a size of 500 pipe diameters or more. Such slugs can cause serious operational failures {{due to the}} strong fluctuating <b>pressure.</b> Identifying the <b>operation</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions at which the long slugs appear, may reduce or prevent these negative effects. In this paper we process and analyse gas–liquid flow measurements in order to investigate the different slug types and their sensitivity to the <b>operation</b> <b>pressure.</b> The measurements were performed in a 103 m long pipe with an internal diameter of 0. 069 m and an inclination of − 0. 1 ° from the horizontal. Three types of slugs were categorized according to the difference in liquid levels (liquid excess) between the slug front and tail. The long slugs {{were found to have}} the largest liquid excess after formation, whereas the hydrodynamic slugs had no liquid excess. The analysis of the measurements provides a detailed overview on the effect of pressure on the long slug length, and a safe operation region where long slugs will not appear...|$|R

50|$|The boiler {{systems at}} the plant {{consists}} of single- or two-pass type, with front/rear/side mill layout, which can have single/bi-drum arrangement with natural or controlled circulation. There is constant or sliding <b>pressure</b> <b>operation,</b> and hot or cold primary air systems. Steam turbine operates at a speeds of 3,000 rpm. The main steam is at 130-250 bar at 500-540 °C. Steam reheat is at 30-70 and 500-600 °C. The back pressure is between 20 and 300 mbar.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of a concentric configuration, {{as opposed to a}} plate or shell and tube heat exchanger, is the simplicity of their design. As such, the insides of both surfaces are easy to clean and maintain, making it ideal for fluids that cause fouling. Additionally, their robust build means that they can withstand high <b>pressure</b> <b>operations.</b> They also produce turbulent conditions at low flow rates, increasing the heat transfer coefficient, and hence the rate of heat transfer. There are significant disadvantages however, the two most noticeable being their high cost in proportion to heat transfer area; and the impractical lengths required for high heat duties. They also suffer from comparatively high heat losses via their large, outer shells.|$|R

The plant will use coal with a sulfur content of less than 0.2% sourced from Kalimantan. Consumption will be 7,240 tonnes per day and around 2.8 million tonnes per year. The plant is expected to produce around 5.5 TWh per year (around 4% of the electricity supply in the region).|$|E
50|$|A {{fundamental}} issue for nuclear reactors {{is that even}} when the nuclear fission process is halted, heat continues to be generated at significant levels by the radioactive decay of the fission products for days and even months. This is known as decay heat and is the major safety driver behind the cooling of nuclear reactors, because this decay heat must be removed. For conventional light water reactors, in all foreseeable circumstances, the flow of cooling water must continue; otherwise damage and melting of the (solid) fuel can result. Light water reactors operate with a volatile coolant, requiring high <b>pressure</b> <b>operation</b> and depressurization in an emergency.|$|E

Emitter end-form geometry consisted of rounded, via electrochemical etching, and truncated, via ion milling. The authors demonstrate high angular intensity operation of 3 ̆e 60 mA/sr especially for the rounded end-form emitters. Advantages include robustness of the material, which is not reliant on material supply {{as is the case with}} standard ZrO/W(100) sources.

50|$|Because of the {{relative}} motion of rotor and stator, molecules preferentially hit the lower side of the blades. Because the blade surface looks down, most of the scattered molecules will leave it downwards. The surface is rough, so no reflection will occur. A blade needs to be thick and stable for high <b>pressure</b> <b>operation</b> and as thin as possible and slightly bent for maximum compression. For high compression ratios the throat between adjacent rotor blades (as shown in the image) is pointing {{as much as possible}} in the forward direction. For high flow rates the blades are at 45° and reach close to the axis.|$|E
50|$|Reduced {{pressure}} drift tubes operate {{using the}} same principles as their atmospheric pressure counterparts, but at drift gas pressure {{of only a few}} torr. Due to the vastly reduced number of ion-neutral interactions, much longer drift tubes or much faster ion shutters are necessary to achieve the same resolving power. However, the reduced <b>pressure</b> <b>operation</b> offers several advantages. First, it eases interfacing the IMS with mass spectrometry. Second, at lower pressures, ions can be stored for injection from an ion trap and re-focussed radially during and after the separation. Third, high values of E/N can be achieved, allowing for direct measurement of K(E/N) over a wide range.|$|E
