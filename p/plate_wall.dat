5000|$|Timber framing, {{historically}} {{called a}} braced frame, {{was the most}} common method of building wooden buildings in America from the 17th-century European settlements until the early 20th century when timber framing was replaced by balloon framing and then platform framing in houses and what was called plank or [...] "joist" [...] framing in barns. The framing in barns is usually visible, but in houses is usually covered with the siding material on the outside and plaster or drywall on the inside. Variations of timber framing are described based on their nature at the foundation, sill <b>plate,</b> <b>wall,</b> wall plate, and roof.|$|E

50|$|In {{the past}} two decades the steel plate shear wall (SPSW), also known as the steel <b>plate</b> <b>wall</b> (SPW), has been used in a number of {{buildings}} in Japan and North America as part of the lateral force resisting system. In earlier days, SPSWs were treated like vertically oriented plate girders and design procedures tended to be very conservative. Web buckling was prevented through extensive stiffening or by selecting an appropriately thick web plate, until more information became available on the post-buckling characteristics of web plates. Although the plate girder theory seems appropriate for the design of an SPW structure, a very important difference is the relatively high bending strength and stiffness of the beams and columns that form the boundary elements of the wall. These members are expected to {{have a significant effect on}} the overall behaviour of a building incorporating this type of system and several researchers have focused on this aspect of SPWs. The energy dissipating qualities of the web plate under extreme cyclic loading has raised the prospect of using SPSWs as a promising alternative to conventional systems in high-risk seismic regions. A further benefit is that the diagonal tension field of the web plate acts like a diagonal brace in a braced frame and thus completes the truss action, which is known to be an efficient means to control wind drift.|$|E
50|$|Game 1 of the Baton Rouge super {{regional}} featured two dominant right-handed pitchers. LSU {{handed the}} ball to sophomore Anthony Ranaudo, while Rice sent junior Mike Ojala to the mound. Rice {{was able to take}} the lead early off multiple LSU errors. Rice scored 2 unearned runs in the 2nd and another unearned run in the 4th. LSU would finally get on the board in bottom of the 4th, scoring a single run, but Rice got the run back in the 5th on a solo home run by Steven Sultzbaugh. With half the game complete, Rice held onto a 4-1 lead, but the bottom of the 5th proved to be the turning point. Rice pulled Ojala in favor of Taylor Wall with runners on second and third, no outs and a run already across the <b>plate.</b> <b>Wall</b> was brought in to face lefty Ryan Schimpf, but the move proved to be a costly one. Schimpf sent a ball over the right-center fence to give LSU a 5-4 lead. LSU would tack on 2 additional runs to give the Tigers a 7-4 lead after 5 innings, a lead the Tigers would not give up. Rice would score 2 runs in the 8th and 3 in the 9th for a total of 9 on the night, but LSU pushed 2 more runs across in the 7th and 3 in the 8th to win the game 12-9. LSU would need only one more win to advance to Omaha.|$|E

40|$|A 356 alloy melt solidifies {{partially}} when {{it flows}} down on an oblique plate cooled from bottom by counter flowing water. Columnar dendrites are continuously formed on the <b>plate</b> <b>wall.</b> Because of the forced convection, these dendrites are sheared off into equiaxed/fragmented grains and then washed away continuously by producing semisolid slurry at plate exit. Plate cooling rate provides required extent/amount of solidification whereas plate length enables necessary shear for producing semisolid slurry of desired quality. Slurry obtained is solidified in metal mould to produce semisolid-cast billets of desired microstructure. Furthermore, semisolid-cast billets are also heat-treated to improve surface quality. Microstructures of both semisolid-cast and heat-treated billets are compared. The effects of plate length and plate cooling rate on solidification and microstructure of billets produced by using oblique plate are illustrated. Three different plate lengths (200 mm, 250 mm, 300 mm) associated {{with three different}} heat transfer coefficients (1000, 2000 and 2500 W/(m(2). K)) are involved.

Mega steel braced frame-composite steel <b>plate</b> shear <b>wall</b> structure, {{consisting}} of mega steel braced frame as outer frame and composite steel <b>plate</b> shear <b>walls</b> as core wall, {{is a new}} type of hybrid structure that is proposed in this study. Seismic performance of this new structure was analyzed under frequent earthquake and severe earthquake.

Comparing with traditional steel frame-RC core wall structure, this new type of hybrid structure presents better coorporative working performance since mega steel braced frame provides larger stiffness and composite steel <b>plate</b> shear <b>wall</b> provides a fairly ductile response. It can be observed from the failure mechanism that this structure has multiple seismic resistant systems with composite steel <b>plate</b> shear <b>wall,</b> mega braces and mega frame when subjected to severe earthquakes...|$|R

The results of the experimental investigation provide an improved correlation for the natural convection regime by accounting for variable property effects and extend the applicable Rayleigh number (Ra) range of the correlation over previous research. The large Rayleigh number regime is emphasized. The value of the Richardson number (Ri) at which combined convection influences become important is also determined. The ratio of the <b>plate</b> <b>wall</b> temperature Tw to the ambient temperature T ∞ is incorporated into the Nusselt number correlation in order to account for variable property influences.

The aim {{of the study was}} to study the behaviour and identify the modes of failure of CFS <b>wall</b> <b>plate</b> system. Two parameters were considered in these studies: 1) different dimension of U-bracket at the supports and 2) different sizes of lipped C-channel. The lipped C-channels used were C 07508, C 07512 and C 10012. The dimensions of the connecting plate's leg were 50 x 35 mm and 50 x 60 mm respectively, where 25 mm clearance was provided to the connections for specimens with clearance. Results show that specimens with and without clearance experienced the same mode of failure. Failure began with the yielding of the connectors followed by distortional buckling of the <b>wall</b> <b>plate.</b> However, when C 075 sections were used as <b>wall</b> <b>plate,</b> the system behaved differently. There was a large deformation in the <b>wall</b> <b>plate</b> and failure began in the distortional buckling of the <b>wall</b> <b>plate</b> followed by bearing of the connecting plates at the supports (U-bracket).
