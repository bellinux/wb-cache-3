40|$|Introduction: Hyperplasia of the <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>tonsil</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of mouth breathing, and {{accurate}} diagnosis of this alteration is important for proper therapeutic planning. Therefore, studies have been conducted in order to provide information regarding the procedures that can be used for the diagnosis of pharyngeal obstruction. Objective: To verify the correlation between nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometric examinations in the diagnosis of <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>tonsil</b> hyperplasia. Method: This was a cross-sectional, clinical, experimental, and quantitative study. Fifty-five children took part in this study, 30 girls and 25 boys, aged between 7 and 11 years. The children underwent nasofibropharyngoscopic and cephalometric evaluation to determine the grade of nasopharyngeal obstruction. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient at the 5 % significance level was used to verify the correlation between these exams. Results: In the nasopharyngoscopy evaluation, most children showed grade 2 and 3 hyperplasia of the <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>tonsil,</b> which was followed by grade 1. In the cephalometry assessment, most children showed grade 1 hyperplasia of the <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>tonsil,</b> which was followed by grade 2.

40|$|Background. The aim of {{the study}} has been to {{determine}} mercury content in selected biological samples: <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>tonsils,</b> gallbladder and femoral head tissues. Methods. Hg content in <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>tonsils</b> (n 474), deposits of the gallbladder (n 180) in femoral head tissues (n 319) has been determined by ICP-AES method {{with the use of}} the plasma spectrophotometer Optima 5300 DV. Biological samples were dissolved by nitric acid (V) in pressure digestion system in a closed system PD 3 - 6. Results. Co-occurrence of Hg with other elements was assessed based on two way correlation analysis results. The analysis of mercury co-occurrence with other elements in exemplary biological samples was carried out for samples in which Hg content generally ranged: in femur bone tissue from 0, 02 – 0, 97 μg/g; in hydroxyapatites of deposits of the gallbladder from 0, 02 – 0, 99 μg/g and in <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>tonsils</b> of children from 0, 05 to 5, 85 μg/g. Because <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>tonsils</b> are located in the main stream of inhaled air where the highest concentration occurred, the highest accumulation of mercury Hg with other trace elements also occurred. The number of significant accumulations is the greatest and the results are very important in the risk evaluation of two way correlation analysis concerning femoral head tissues.

Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), stromal cells located in the light zone of the germinal centre of lymphoid follicles, seem to be the principal causal factor in the accumulation of the infectious agent in transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) diseases. Knowing that efficient lymphoreticular prion propagation requires PrPc expression, we analysed the expression of PrPc with the mouse monoclonal antibody Pri 909 both in situ and on FDC-cluster-enriched cell suspensions. In situ, a positive staining was observed in the germinal centre of pharyngeal lymph follicles. The germinal centre labelling was due to the presence of a follicular dendritic network as revealed after immunogold staining of isolated FDC clusters.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to identify Mycobacterium spp. and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, respectively. Histologically, the tissue masses consisted of confluent mature micro-granulomata that were characterised by central caseous necrosis surrounded by multinucleated giant cells, macrophages and lymphoid cells and an outer mature fibrous connective tissue capsule. Within some foci of caseous necrosis were variably sized colonies of small, Gram-negative, acid-fast bacilli, which showed positive IHC labelling for Mycobacterium spp., leading to a presumptive diagnosis of AM.

Tonsillectomy is often the treatment of choice for tonsillar diseases. So far, it is the most frequent and one of the oldest surgical procedures performed in children and young adults. The criteria for tonsillectomy, its effect on patient's immunological integrity and the surgical risks are widely controversial. Image study using paranasal sinuses x-ray is a very simple, easy and comfortable method to evaluate the sizes of adenoids and the grade of upper airway obstruction. Cohen et al. supported that paranasal sinuses x-ray is the best way to determine <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>tonsil</b> hypertrophy. On the other hand, nasopharyngolaryngoscopy can provide more accurate data on the nasopharynx, as it can dynamically reveal its structures and the obstruction status of the upper airway. This study compared the grade of adenoid hypertrophy, as well as upper airway obstruction, using the above-mentioned approaches in children ranging from 3 to 10 years old. The study came to the conclusion that nasopharyngolaryngoscopy is a much more accurate diagnostic procedure than radiological evaluation of the nasopharynx...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} proved the {{possible}} implication of nasal associated lymphoid tissues, mainly the <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>tonsil,</b> in prion pathogenesis. However, {{the mechanisms of}} this neuroinvasion are still being debated. To determine the potential sites for prion neuroinvasion inside the ovine <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>tonsil,</b> the topography of neurofilaments heavy (200 kDa) (NFH), neurofilaments light (70 kDa) (NFL) and glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) was semi-quantitatively analysed inside the different compartments of the tonsil. The {{results showed that the}} most innervated areas were the interfollicular area and the connective tissue located beneath the respiratory epithelium. Even if the germinal centre of the lymphoid follicles was poorly innervated, the existence of rare follicular dendritic cell-nerve synapses inside the germinal centre indicates that this mechanism of neuroinvasion is possible but unlikely to be unique. The host PRNP genotype did not influence the pattern of innervation in these different tonsil compartments, unlike age: an increase of nerve endings in a zone of high trafficking cells beneath the respiratory epithelium occurred with ageing. A minimal age-related increase of innervation inside the lymphoid follicles was also observed. An increase in nerve fibre density around the lymphoid follicles, in an area rich in mobile cells able to transport PrPd, could ensure a more efficient infectivity, not in the early phase but in the advanced phase of lymphoinvasion after amplification of PrPd, or could act as direct site of entry during neuroinvasion.

50|$|The upper {{portion of}} the pharynx, the nasopharynx, extends {{from the base of}} the skull to the upper surface of the soft palate. It {{includes}} the space between the internal nares and the soft palate and lies above the oral cavity. The adenoids, also known as the <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>tonsils,</b> are lymphoid tissue structures located in the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. Waldeyer's tonsillar ring is an annular arrangement of lymphoid tissue in both the nasopharynx and oropharynx.Polyps or mucus can obstruct the nasopharynx, as can congestion due to an upper respiratory infection. The auditory tube, which connect the middle ear to the pharynx, opens into the nasopharynx at the pharyngeal opening of the auditory tube. The opening and closing of the auditory tubes serves to equalize the barometric pressure in the middle ear with that of the ambient atmosphere.|$|R
40|$|Postmortem {{cross-sectional}} imaging using multislice {{computed tomography}} (MSCT) and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) was considered {{as a base for}} a minimal invasive postmortem investigation in forensic medicine such as within the Virtopsy approach. We present the case of a 3 -year-old girl with a lethal streptococcus group A infection and the findings of postmortem imaging in this kind of natural death. Postmortem MSCT and MRI revealed an edematous occlusion of the larynx {{at the level of the}} vocal cords, severe pneumonia with atelectatic parts of both upper lobes and complete atelectasis of both lower lobes, purulent fluid-filled right main bronchus, enlargement of cervical lymph nodes and <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>tonsils,</b> and additionally, a remaining glossopharyngeal cyst as well as an ureter fissus of the right kidney. All relevant autopsy findings could be obtained and visualized by postmortem imaging and confirmed by histological and microbiological investigations supporting the idea of a minimal invasive autopsy technique...|$|R
40|$|Background. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of secondary dust and car emission on the intoxication of adenoids. Material and methods. The amount of Pb, Be, Ba, Ca, Mg and Sr in <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>tonsils</b> of children living in Tychy (n 86), and in Chorzów (n 76) as well as the amount of the selected elements in suspended dust was determined by the ICP – AES method. The biological material had previously been subjected to mineralization using of nitric acid (V) spectrally pure Merck. Results. Secondary emission as a potential additional source of trace elements in tonsils is described by secondary emission coefficient and by the additional weight of the metal present in general air pollution. Conclusions. The degree of accumulation of analyzed elements in the adenoid tissue mostly depends on the content of these elements in soluble form in suspended dust in the ground layer of air, as a result of secondary and car emissions...|$|R
