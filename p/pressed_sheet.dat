Differences in colorants, solid ink density, and dot gain between hard copy output devices are some of the reasons that proofs and <b>press</b> <b>sheets</b> don’t match. The Inter-national Color Consortium (ICC) has developed a system-level color management tool which is aimed at improving color rendering between various imaging devices. In this paper, the ICC-based color matching experiments were performed {{with the use of a}} four-color sheet-fed offset press, a film-based color proofer, and a thermal dye transfer process. Specifically, we investigated if ICC-based CMS can help an analog color proofer and a continuous-tone digital color proofer improve its color matching to a reference <b>press</b> <b>sheet.</b> Experimental findings based on observer analysis using rank ordering, and colorimetric analysis between proofs and <b>press</b> <b>sheets</b> were discussed...|$|R

40|$|Contract {{proofing}} {{for printing}} has been traditionally done by press proofing. This is costly and wasteful, {{not just in}} terms of equipment and labor but also in terms of expendables. The advent of off-press proofing was greeted with some degree of uncertainty by the printing industry. With press proofing, the proof was literally a preview of what would happen on a press. The press proof, although often printed on a different press, generally used the same type of inks, plates and substrate that would characterize the final print. With offpress proofing, printers were comparing apples to oranges; instead of comparing a <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> to a <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> they were comparing a <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> to an approximation of a <b>press</b> <b>sheet.</b> However, over time as printers learned to read off-press proofs, they became accepted as contract proofs. The same situation has now befallen digital proofs. In the particular case of flexography, the proofing problem is a bit different. Off-press analog proofs were designed with lithography in mind, they were characterized to simulate lithographic dot gain. In order to make a proof that looks like a flexographic <b>press</b> <b>sheet,</b> two sets of films are required; one which compensates for flexographic dot gain (this is the set from which the job would be printed) and one which has extra dot gain built into the highlight and quarter- tones (this is the set that the proof would be made from). This extra set of films is wasteful and time consuming to generate. Digital proofing seems to be well suited for flexography, because the dot gain can be built into the proofing system and no extra film is required to create the proof. At the most basic level {{there are two types of}} digital proofers available; those which simulate halftone dots and those that do not. Whether or not the dots are necessary is open to discussion, however, in the case of flexography the dots appear to be crucial. For this research document it was decided that the halftone dots were preferred. The reason for this is that at about 133 lpi the rosette patterns formed by halftone dots are at the threshold of resolution by the human eye. For more course screen rulings this is even more critical. Much of flexography is printed at screen rulings of 133 lpi or lower, so very often the dots can be resolved by the eye. Therefore, the mindset at the beginning of the research was that if the dots can be resolved on the <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> then the dots should be resolved on the proof. The major thrust of this research was to observe whether or not a halftone-based digital proofer can simulate the appearance of a flexographic <b>press</b> <b>sheet.</b> A flexographic test form was created and printed on a film based substrate. A <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> was sent to two vendors who manufacture halftone proofers. The proofing systems are not mentioned by name; they are instead referred to as Digital Proof A and B. They then attempted to match the <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> as closely as possible. Thus, through reverse engineering, the vendors created a device profile for this set of printing conditions. Upon receipt of the proofs, they were compared to the <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> in terms of optical density, hue (AE) and halftone dot size. Later, a visual assessment was executed to observe how closely the digital proofs matched the <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> using a 3 M Matchprint, that had been altered to approximate flexography, as the reference or control proof. The results showed that there were significant differences between proof and <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> in some instances and insignificant differences in others. In terms of the physical structure of the halftone dots, the 3 M Matchprint had the closest match to the <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> dot structure. In terms of physical dot size; digital proof A best matched the 50 and 75 % dots and the Matchprint matched the 5 % dots the best. In terms of optical density; digital proof A best matched the density of the 25 % dots, digital proof B best matched the density of the 5 % dots and the Matchprint best matched the 50 and 75 % dot patches. In terms of AE values (color or hue difference); the Matchprint most closely matched the <b>press</b> <b>sheet,</b> digital proof B was next, and digital proof A was last. In terms of a visual match, the three proofs were found to be statistically equal in their ability to visually match the <b>press</b> <b>sheet.</b> The visual match being the most powerful of the criteria; shows that the measurable differences in the proofs did not directly affect their ability to match the <b>press</b> <b>sheet.</b> The results show that either of the two halftone digital proofs could have been used in place of the 3 M Matchprint. The results also question the need for halftone dots in a proof. This is primarily because the two halftone digital proofs utilized a different RIP than the Agfa generated films for the 3 M Matchprint and flexographic <b>press</b> <b>sheet.</b> Yet the visual observations made by the judges could not, at a normal viewing distance, discern this difference. The conclusion is that there is no visual difference between the halftone digital proofs and the 3 M Matchprint proof in terms of visually matching the <b>press</b> <b>sheet...</b>|$|R

First, a set of color samples was generated. Observer evaluations of these color samples were converted to numeric values using psychometric evaluation methods. Using statistical methods, observer evaluations in numeric form were then tested against values obtained by using the proposed system. Observer evaluations of the color samples were also compared statistically with values from the Total Color Difference system as an additional test.

When the catch is rotated back, the barrel is locked and the machine gun can resume firing. Both the receiver housing and ventilated barrel casing are made from <b>pressed</b> <b>sheet</b> steel.

40|$|The {{development}} of a closed loop press control system has been the goal of many press manufacturers in recent years. These closed loop systems are designed to collect data from sample <b>press</b> <b>sheets</b> by measuring certain process variables which {{are considered to be}} indicators of press control. The theory is that by controlling the variation of these indicator variables, it is possible to control the color variation of the halftone overprints of the reproduction. The problem in the design of these automatic control systems, however, concerns which process variables should be considered indicators of press control. This study was undertaken to determine which process variables in sheet fed offset lithography can be considered indicators of press control in the halftone overprints of the <b>press</b> <b>sheet.</b> This thesis involves a series of correlation analyses which study the interellationships between several process variables of the reproduction. These process variables are: solid ink density of the process colors, density of screened process colors, hue and gray value of halftone overprint colors, hue and gray values of a near neutral gray halftone overprint, and hue and gray values of a critical halftone overprint color. The sample <b>press</b> <b>sheets</b> used in this thesis were taken from industrial production so that the results of the correlation studies of the process variables could be considered typical of those in industry. The experimental results indicated that the variation of the solid ink density of the process colors at the color bars was not a true indicator of the variation which occurred in the screened process colors. It was possible for the density of the solids to remain very close to the standard while the screened process colors varied in a large amount or in the opposite direction from the solids. This indicated that the density of the screened process colors was controlled by variables other than solid ink density. The experimental results also indicated that the density of the screened process colors may vary in large amounts from the standard and continue to produce halftone overprints with hue and gray values comparable to the standard. Also, the variations of the hue and gray values of the halftones were not consistent within the same <b>press</b> <b>sheet.</b> It may be concluded that further study is necessary which would clarify the proper indicator variables {{to be used in the}} control of the offset lithographic press. From the results of this study, it appears that proper control of the press is attainable through visually matching the halftones on the <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> to those on the standard. Even though the process variables of this study showed a marked amount of variation, the hues and gray values of the halftone overprints remained visually stable. If an automatic closed loop press control system is to succeed, it must be able to evaluate the hues and gray values of the halftones. Proper adjustments can then be made to the offset press to match the halftones of the <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> to the standard...|$|R
40|$|The {{multi-angle}} screening configuration {{is by far}} {{the most}} widely used screening configuration for process color printing, but there are alternative screening configurations which may be preferable in certain situations. Color separations made using the Staggered Position One-Angle screening configuration are reported to provide printed reproductions on newsprint which appear sharper, offer improved color reproduction, produce smoother color reproduction, and preserve color better in the shadows. The staggered position technique can be generated with high-end scanners and prepress equipment, as well as with desktop publishing workstations using the 2 ̆ 2 Flamenco 2 ̆ 2 screening algorithm. However, the staggered position method may be subject to greater color variation than the multi-angle method due to random misregistration which can occur during a newspaper press run. This study investigated printed process color reproductions produced by the staggered position screening technique in comparison to reproductions produced by the multi-angle screening technique at two commonly used screen rulings, 85 and 100 lpi, on newsprint. During a press run, one printing plate at a time was laterally misregistered in eight increments. A total of 32 sample <b>press</b> <b>sheets</b> and an OK standard <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> were taken during the press run. A series of printed color patches on each <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> were measured with a computerized spectrophotometer to determine if the color difference (AE) between the sample and the OK standard <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> was significant or not. The two screening methods were also evaluated for consistency of color reproduction. Using a two sample t-test, it was determined that color misregistration resulted in a significant statistical difference between the staggered position test target and the multi- angle test target for the same screen frequency. On an individual patch-by-patch comparison, there were certain patches which did not exhibit a significant statistical difference between the two screen configurations. It was also determined that the multiangle screening method produced consistent, acceptable color variation with every increment of misregistration. The staggered position technique produced unpredictable and often unacceptable amounts of color variation which varied with misregistration and the number of overprinting inks...|$|R
