40|$|In this study, the {{displacement}} and blocking {{force of the}} tip point of a cantilevered electro-active polymer (EAP) actuator has been controlled for a cell injection process which consists of approaching, interacting and leaving steps. A vision-based system is used to acquire the tip displacement data for identifying a transfer function model of the actuator and its position control. Discrete time Proportional-Integral controllers are used to control the <b>position</b> and <b>blocking</b> force. A Smith Predictor is utilized in the vision-based position control system {{to compensate for the}} time delay due to image processing. Experimental <b>position</b> and <b>blocking</b> force results prove that the proposed control strategies are effective enough to guide the actuator to undertake the cell injection process. This study contributes to the previously published work {{from the point of view}} of simultaneously controlling the <b>position</b> and <b>blocking</b> force of the electroactive polymer actuators and widening their application areas...|$|R

The EKF and the described enhancement methods are used on a standard Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) by software computing, thus omitting the need for hardware component additions.

The apparatus includes valve means disposed around an annular conduit, such as a nozzle, in the engine cooling air circuit. The valve means, when in a closed <b>position,</b> <b>blocks</b> {{a portion of the}} conduit, and thus reduces the amount and increases the velocity of cooling air flowing through the nozzle. The apparatus also includes actuation means, which can operate in response to predetermined engine conditions, for enabling opening and closing of the valve means...|$|R
50|$|In 1957, two {{experimental}} sleet tenders {{were built}} at Acton Works, for testing on the Piccadilly line. One tender {{was attached to}} the front of a regular tube train while the other {{was attached to the}} rear. The tenders were low so as not to obstruct the driver's view. The experiment was not a success, however, because the signalling had accurately <b>positioned</b> <b>block</b> joints, which operated train stops. The extra length of the train with the tenders attached would have required significant alterations to the signalling system, and the advent of de-icing gear attached to regular service trains followed soon afterwards.|$|R

50|$|Another {{problem was}} terrain. Although Nam Bac {{appeared}} upon the map {{to be an}} ideal spot to establish a <b>position</b> <b>blocking</b> a communist advance on Luang Prabang, {{it would have to}} be supplied by air in the absence of any roads. Moreover, Nam Bac was closer to North Vietnam than to Luang Prabang. While it was a trackless 96 km upriver north of Luang Prabang, it was only 64 km downriver southwest of the Vietnamese border. Furthermore, for much of the 64 km, Route 19 also offered an easy entry for the invading Vietnamese. Thus Nam Bac could be more easily reinforced by the Vietnamese than by Lao Royalist troops.|$|R
50|$|Iran {{launched}} three diversionary attacks {{prior to}} Operation Nasr. The first one began on January 4-6, near Qasr-e-Shirin in {{central part of}} the border with Iraq. A brigade of regular Iranian mountain troops attacked Iraqi forces that were in a defensive <b>position,</b> <b>blocking</b> the main highway between Tehran and Baghdad. In a pattern which would become all too familiar later during the war, the Iranians infiltrated through the Iraqi positions, and even captured some enemy units. But the battle broke down into a fight for each hill and mountain peak, and the Iraqis rushed reinforcements. While Iran gained 8 kilometers, they did not achieve any significant tactical advantage.|$|R

The pistol frame is made of aluminum alloy and the barrel is made of alloy steel, while the handgrips are usually made of walnut or polymer materials. The P25 is aimed extensively at the civilian market as a self-defense weapon due to its concealability, but is somewhat less favorable compared to the M57, M88 and CZ 99 pistols due to its small caliber.|$|R
