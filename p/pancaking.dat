40|$|The hot torsion {{simulator}} {{has been}} extensively used {{as a means to}} understand the microstructure evolution of different steel grades during hot rolling. The test is suitable to simulate ‘real’ industrial schedules as well as schedules designed to obtain information regarding the intrinsic properties of the materials. For example, it is common to apply ‘average’ schedules, in which deformation per pass, interpass time, strain rate and cooling rate are kept constant, to determine the characteristic temperatures Ar 3, Ar 1 and Tnr (start and finish of the austenite transformation and no recrystallization temperatures) of steels. In this work, both a ‘real’ schedule simulating a rolling schedule in a reversing mill and an ‘average’ schedule were applied to a series of Ti and Nb microalloyed steels. In general, the steels exhibited somewhat different behaviours for the different thermomechanical schedules, e. g. the <b>pancaking</b> temperature region is easily detectable after an ‘average’ schedule, while for the ‘real’ schedule some softening can be detected in the <b>pancaking</b> region, which is strongly dependent on the strain and interpass time.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{the development of}} a physically-based model describing the microstructural evolution during hot deformation of microalloyed steels. The work is mainly focused on the recrystallization kinetics. During hot rolling, the repeated deformation and recrystallization provides progressively refined recrystallized grains. Also, recrystallization enables the material to be deformed more easily and knowledge of the recrystallization kinetics is important in order to predict the required roll forces. Hot strip rolling is generally conducted in a reversing roughing mill followed by a continuous finishing mill. During rolling in the roughing mill the temperature is high and complete recrystallization should occur between passes. In the finishing mill the temperature is lower which means slower recrystallization kinetics and partial or no recrystallization often occurs. If microalloying elements such as Nb, Ti or V are present, the recrystallization can be further retarded by either solute drag or particle pinning. When recrystallization is completely retarded and strain is accumulated between passes, the austenite grains will be severely deformed, i. e. <b>pancaking</b> occurs. <b>Pancaking</b> of the grains provides larger amount of nucleation sites for ferrite grains upon transformation and hence a finer ferrite grain size is achieved. In this work a physically-based model has been used to describe the microstructural evolution of austenite. The model is built-up by several sub-models describing dislocation density evolution, recrystallization, grain growth and precipitation. It is based on dislocation density theory where the generated dislocations during deformation provide the driving force for recrystallization. In the model, subgrains act as nuclei for recrystallization and the condition for recrystallization to start is that the subgrains reach a critical size and configuration. The retarding effect due to elements in solution and as precipitated particles is accounted for in the model. To verify and validate the model axisymmetric compression tests combined with relaxation were modeled and the results were compared with experimental data. The precipitation sub-model was verified by the use of literature data. In addition, rolling in the hot strip mill was modeled using process data from the hot strip mill at SSAB Strip Products Division. The materials investigated were plain C-Mn steels and Nb microalloyed steels. The results from the model show good agreement with measured data.  QC 2010070...|$|E

Instead, they have agreed to implement a system whereby national transmission tariffs provide access to the entire IEM. This system is supplemented by a scheme of inter-TSO payments. However, conflict may arise if the compensation that a country must pay another one is not {{in accordance with the}} electrical usage that the former is making of the grid of the latter. For instance, Inter TSO Compensation methods (ITC methods) implicitly allocate the cost of any existing or new transmission line. Therefore, the adoption of an inefficient method may be an obstacle for building some needed regional grid investments. Consequently, one should give careful consideration to the selection of the ITC method. This paper analyzes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the implementation of the most relevant ITC methods that have been considered so far in the European debate. When assessing each method from a conceptual point of view, considerable attention is devoted to the critical examination of its main underlying assumptions. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

The data conflicts with the standard model {{where most of the}} gas in a low-mass dark matter halo is assumed to settle into a disk of cold gas that is depleted by star formation and supernova-driven outflows until the disk becomes gravitationally stable. A consistent model can be found if low-mass haloes are embedded in a preheated medium, with a specific gas entropy 10 Kev cm^ 2. Such a model simultaneously matches the faint-end slope of the galaxy luminosity function.

In the last two cases we also created new versions of the approximation by truncation, i. e., by smoothing the initial conditions with various smoothing window shapes and varying their sizes. The primary tool for comparing simulations to approximation schemes was cross-correlation of the evolved mass density fields, testing the extent to which mass was moved to the right place.

40|$|Few recent {{generations of}} cosmologists have solved non-local newtonian {{equations}} of the gravitational instability in an expanding universe. In this approach <b>pancaking</b> is the predominant form of first collapsing objects. Relativistic counter{{parts of the}}se equations contain the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor. In the linear theory the magnetic part is associated with gravitational waves. If the magnetic part is ignored, then the newtonian limit of the relativistic equations is reduced to the closed set of the local Lagrangian equations. Recently this fact drew much attention since the gravitational instability in that form would greatly simplify the study of cosmic structure formation. In particular, the filamentary structure of collapsing is predicted. In this paper we resolve the contradiction between the newtonian theory and relativistic version adopted in some recent papers. We show that dropping the magnetic part from the basic relativistic equations is incorrect. The correct newtonian limit is derived by the 1 /c-expansion of the GR equations and the Bianchi identities for the Weyl tensor. The last ones begin with ∼ 1 /c 3 order, therefore one {{must take into account}} the magnetic part in the post newtonian order ∼ 1 /c 3, which contains non-local terms, related to the non-local gravitational interaction. For the first time we rigorously show that the basic GR equations with the magnetic part are reduced precisely to the canonic newtonian non-local equations. Thus, the correct treatment of the relativistic version of the gravitational instability resurrects the canonic picture of the structure formation.

40|$|We {{present a}} 2. 5 D MHD {{simulation}} of a magnetic flux rope (FR) propagating in the heliosphere and investigate {{the cause of}} the observed sharp plasma beta transition. Specifically, we consider a strong internal magnetic field and an explosive fast start, such that the plasma beta is significantly lower in the FR than the sheath region that is formed ahead. This leads to an unusual FR morphology in the first stage of propagation, while the more traditional view (e. g. from space weather simulations like Enlil) of a `pancake' shaped FR is observed as it approaches 1 AU. We investigate how an equipartition line, defined by a magnetic Weber number, surrounding a core region of a propagating FR can demarcate a boundary layer where there is a sharp transition in the plasma beta. The substructure affects the distribution of toroidal flux, with the majority of the flux remaining in a small core region which maintains a quasi-cylindrical structure. Quantitatively, we investigate a locus of points where the kinetic energy density of the relative inflow field is equal to the energy density of the transverse magnetic field (i. e. effective tension force). The simulation provides compelling evidence that at all heliocentric distances the distribution of toroidal magnetic flux away from the FR axis is not linear; with 80 % of the toroidal flux occurring within 40 % of the distance from the FR axis. Thus our simulation displays evidence that the competing ideas of a <b>pancaking</b> structure observed remotely can coexist with a quasi-cylindrical magnetic structure seen in situ.

40|$|We present further {{analysis}} of an anisotropic, non-singular early universe model {{that leads to}} the viable cosmology presented in Dechant et al (2009 Phys. Rev. D 79, 043524). Although this model (the Dechant–Lasenby–Hobson (DLH) model) contains scalar field matter, it is reminiscent of the Taub-NUT vacuum solution in that it has biaxial Bianchi IX geometry and its evolution exhibits a dimensionality reduction at a quasi-regular singularity that one can identify with the Big Bang. We show that the DLH and Taub-NUT metrics are related by a coordinate transformation, in which the DLH time coordinate plays the role of conformal time for Taub-NUT. Since both models continue through the Big Bang, the coordinate transformation can become multivalued. In particular, in mapping from DLH to Taub-NUT, the Taub-NUT time can take only positive values. We present explicit maps between the DLH and Taub-NUT models, with and without a scalar field. In the vacuum DLH model, we find a periodic solution expressible in terms of elliptic integrals; this periodicity is broken in a natural manner as a scalar field is gradually introduced to recover the original DLH model. Mapping the vacuum solution over to Taub-NUT coordinates recovers the standard (non-periodic) Taub-NUT solution in the Taub region, where Taub-NUT time takes positive values, but does not exhibit the two NUT regions known in the standard Taub-NUT solution. Conversely, mapping the complete Taub-NUT solution to the DLH case reveals that the NUT regions correspond to imaginary time and space in DLH coordinates. We show that many of the well-known 'pathologies' of the Taub-NUT solution arise because the traditional coordinates are connected by a multivalued transformation to the physically more meaningful DLH coordinates. In particular, the 'open-to-closed-to-open' transition and the Taub and NUT regions of the (Lorentzian) Taub-NUT model are replaced by a closed <b>pancaking</b> universe with spacelike homogeneous sections at all times...|$|E

All other schemes, including those proposed as generalizations of the Zel'dovich approximation created by adding forces, were in fact generally worse by this measure. By explicitly checking, we verified that the success of our best-choice was a result of the best treatment of the phases of nonlinear Fourier components. Of all schemes tested, the adhesion approximation produced the most accurate nonlinear power spectrum and density distribution, but its phase errors suggest mass condensations were moved to slightly the wrong location. Due to its better reproduction of the mass density distribution function and power spectrum, it might be preferred for some uses.

40|$|We use recent {{observations}} of the H i mass function to constrain galaxy formation. The data conflict with the standard model {{where most of the}} gas in a low-mass dark matter halo is assumed to settle into a disc of cold gas that is depleted by star formation and supernova-driven outflows until the disc becomes gravitationally stable. Assuming a star formation threshold density supported by both theory and observations, this model predicts H i masses that are much too large. The reason is simple: supernova feedback requires star formation, which in turn requires a high surface density for the gas. Heating by the ultraviolet background can reduce the amount of cold gas in haloes with masses < 109. 5 h− 1 M⊙, but is insufficient to explain the observed H i mass function. A consistent model can be found if low-mass haloes are embedded in a pre-heated medium, with a specific gas entropy ∼ 10 keV cm 2. In addition, such a model simultaneously matches the faint-end slope of the galaxy luminosity function without the need for any supernova-driven outflows.

Implementation of provisions contained in the directives released a downward trend in dynamics of electric energy and gas prices in most member countries. Despite it the introduction of competition rules to these sectors comes across difficulties. It is due not only to technical barriers (lack of a sufficient number of cross-border links) but also, for instance, to the fact that electric energy and gas are treated as goods the access to which should be guaranteed for all those interested in it. An additional problem is also the cost of access to a network, level and differentiation of transmission charges (post stamp model, distance charges, zone payments) in particular countries, which leads to the <b>pancaking</b> of transmission charges. It should be noted that liberalisation brings about major changes in economic situation of particular companies operating in the market of electric energy and gas, which involves their restructuring and primarily reduction of employment in these sectors. The liberalisation process is spread over years and necessitates numerous adjustments in organisational and legal fields. Its expression is a cycle of regulators’ meetings focussed on assessing steps taken by the member countries. Zadanie pt.

40|$|The process {{parameters}} {{that affect}} the anisotropy of mechanical properties of two Nb microalloyed linepipe steels (grades X- 70 and X- 80) were examined by controlled rolling and accelerated cooling on a pilot mill. The rolling schedules were first simulated by multi-pass torsion testing so as to determine the critical temperatures, such as T$ sb{ rm nr}$ and Ar$ sb 3. $ Using the torsion test results, two finish rolling temperatures were chosen {{so as to be}} above and below the A$ sb 3 $ (in the $ gamma$ + $ alpha$ region). Two reheat temperatures were selected to study the effect of prior austenite grain size. The properties of air cooled samples are compared with those of specimens cooled at two different rates; in each case, cooling was interrupted at one of three different temperatures. The textures were measured by x-ray diffractometry and are presented in the form of ODF plots and skeleton lines. The yield strengths were measured by carrying out tensile tests along directions inclined at increasing angles to the rolling direction. The state of the pancaked austenite before transformation was characterized in terms of the effective interfacial area. It is shown that this parameter determines the sharpness of the transformation texture because it accounts for both the amount of <b>pancaking</b> strain applied to the austenite before transformation and the austenite grain size. Another important factor affecting texture development during transformation is the rate of cooling, as it determines the dislocation density present on each active slip system. The results of hardness testing, texture measurement, and mechanical testing showed that a moderate cooling rate and a medium cooling interruption temperature lead to the best combination of a fine microstructure and a desirable texture. It is shown that accelerated cooling increases both the yield strength and the planar anisotropy of the yield strength, the latter property rising to a maximum in the samples associated with the lowest cooling interruption temperature. Comparison between the experimental results and model predictions of the yield strength ratio indicates that the pancake and lath models are in the best agreement with the measured values...|$|E
40|$|Eutectoid steel strips are {{designed}} {{for the production of}} parts for intensive use such as clutches, seat slides, and springs as they exhibit excellent strength levels and wear resistance. These properties arise from the unique morphology of lamellar pearlite which can be considered as a self-laminated nanoscale composite. However, a spheroidization annealing step is nowadays necessary to improve the cold forming properties before further cold rolling steps. This thesis is aimed at improving the tensile ductility of the hot rolled products of eutectoid composition in order to eliminate the intermediate annealing step. Two strategies are proposed. The first is to transpose the concept of controlled rolling developed for HSLA to eutectoid steels. Through a strict adjustment of the austenite processing and of the cooling strategy, it is possible to improve the ductility of the final lamellar microstructure. The way the processing parameters influence the hot deformation of austenite, the eutectoid transformation and of the subsequent spheroidization annealing is deeply investigated. It is found that refinement and <b>pancaking</b> of austenite is beneficial as it reduces the pearlite block size improving the total tensile elongation. Accelerated cooling is of paramount importance to achieve fine Interlamellar spacing (ILS), which lead to high strength levels and accelerate spheroidization during subsequent annealing. The second approach involves intercritical or warm deformation. Warm processing of eutectoid steels is first explored by torsion testing and then up-scaled to a pilot rolling-line. The interactions between thermomechanical parameters, rolling forces generated and microstructural evolution are carefully scrutinized. During concurrent hot deformation, spheroidization of cementite takes place almost instantaneously in both torsion and rolling. The restoration processes occurring in the ferrite matrix depends on the strain path and the strain rates. Low strain rates (0, 1 s− 1) and simple shear promotes the formation of a recrystallized-like HABs network of about 3 μm in size. Plane strain compression and high strain rates (10 s− 1) leads to the formation of a typical recovered dislocation substructure (LABs) of 1 μm in size. During annealing, no recrystallization occurs and the LABs substructure remains stable. This substructure influences drammatically the mechanical properties: the strength is very high and the work-hardening behavior is poor due to high recovery rate in the region close to the LABs. However, due to the presence of spheroidized cementite particles the ductility of warm rolled eutectoid steels is higher than that of ultra fine grained low carbon steels.

40|$|International audienceWe present further {{analysis}} of an anisotropic, non-singular early universe model {{that leads to}} the viable cosmology presented in [1]. Although this model (the DLH model) contains scalar field matter, it is reminiscent of the Taub-NUT vacuum solution in that it has biaxial Bianchi IX geometry and its evolution exhibits a dimensionality reduction at a quasi-regular singularity that one can identify with the big-bang. We show that the DLH and Taub-NUT metrics are related by a coordinate transformation, in which the DLH time coordinate plays the role of conformal time for Taub-NUT. Since both models continue through the big-bang, the coordinate transformation can become multivalued. In particular, in mapping from DLH to Taub-NUT, the Taub-NUT time can take only positive values. We present explicit maps between the DLH and Taub-NUT models, with and without a scalar field. In the vacuum DLH model, we find a periodic solution expressible in terms of elliptic integrals; this periodicity is broken in a natural manner as a scalar field is gradually introduced to recover the original DLH model. Mapping the vacuum solution over to Taub-NUT coordinates, recovers the standard (non-periodic) Taub-NUT solution in the Taub region, where Taub-NUT time takes positive values, but does not exhibit the two NUT regions known in the standard Taub-NUT solution. Conversely, mapping the complete Taub-NUT solution to the DLH case reveals that the NUT regions correspond to imaginary time and space in DLH coordinates. We show that many of the well-known 'pathologies ' of the Taub-NUT solution arise because the traditional coordinates are connected by a multivalued transformation to the physically more meaningful DLH coordinates. In particular, the 'open-to-closed-to-open ' transition and the Taub and NUT regions of the (Lorentzian) Taub-NUT model are replaced by a closed <b>pancaking</b> universe with spacelike homogeneous sections at all times.

40|$|Rail steels rely {{primarily}} on possessing adequate wear and rolling contact fatigue resistance. These properties, {{together with the}} toughness, can in principle be optimized by implementing thermomechanical processing assisted by controlled niobium additions. The {{purpose of the current}} work is to develop a Nb-microalloying strategy in the context of high-carbon pearlitic and cementite-free bainitic steels. The conventional methods do not leave the critical regions of a rail section in a suitably processed state. An attempt has been made for the first time, to create a pancaked austenite grain structure, with an examination of the consequences on the final product. One of the major difficulties is to ensure that niobium does not segregate during manufacturing, since niobium is a strong carbide former and rail steels traditionally contain large carbon concentrations. Niobium solubility in austenite has been assessed critically and thermodynamic calculations for microsegregation have been taken into account. The aim is to ensure that any primary niobium carbide precipitated from solute-enriched liquid during non-equilibrium solidification, can be taken into solution in austenite during reheating, to mitigate potential effects of coarse precipitates on the final mechanical properties. Rail steels containing 0. 01 - 0. 02 wt% Nb have been designed and characterised. In as-cast condition, primary niobium carbides as large as ~ 10 µm can be observed, which dissolve slowly during reheating. An attempt has been made to develop a model to estimate the dissolution kinetics of the carbides. Dissolved niobium in reheated austenite precipitates during hot deformation as fine niobium carbides (< 50 nm) which inhibit austenite recrystallisation by pinning the austenite grain boundaries. Nb-microalloying increases the ‘no-recrystallisation temperature’ of deformed austenite during multi-pass compression tests. The topology of grain deformation has been analysed in terms of stereological calculations and dilatometric experiments have shown that transformation kinetics tend to accelerate when the austenite is deformed below the no-recrystallisation temperature, however the effect is relatively small. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the as-rolled Nb-microalloyed steels have been characterised along with their rolling-sliding wear performance and compared with their non-microalloyed counterparts. Increased austenite grain boundary area and increased dislocation activity due to <b>pancaking,</b> hinder bainite growth which leads to an increased retained austenite volume fraction. This in turn, leads to slightly improved ductility, improved toughness and improved wear resistance in Nb-microalloyed bainitic alloys. Microstructural refinement in Nbmicroalloyed pearlitic alloys does not have any significant effect on tensile and toughness properties, but wear resistance improves significantly. A Bayesian neural network model has been developed to estimate the wear of rails. Predicted trends have been found consistent with metallurgical experience and the perceived noise levels are consistent with reasonable repeatability of the wear testing method used. The model can be applied widely to estimate wear because of its capacity to indicate uncertainty, including both the perceived level of noise in the output, and an uncertainty associated with fitting the function in the local region of input space...|$|E
40|$|The {{mitigation}} of {{seismic risk}} {{in urban areas}} in the United States and abroad is of major concern for all governments. Unfortunately no comprehensive studies have attempted {{to address this issue}} in a rigorous, quantitative manner. This study tackles this problem head-on for one typical class of tall buildings in southern California. The approach adopted here {{can be used as a}} template to study earthquake risk in other seismically sensitive regions of the world, such as Taiwan, Japan, Indonesia, China, South American countries (Chile, Bolivia, etc.), and the west coast of the United States (in particular, Seattle). In 1857 a large earthquake of magnitude 7. 9 [1] occurred on the San Andreas fault with rupture initiating at Parkeld in Central California and propagating in a southeasterly direction over a distance of more than 360 km. Such a unilateral rupture produces signicant directivity toward the San Fernando and Los Angeles basins. Indeed, newspaper reports (Los Angeles Star [2, 3]) of sloshing observed in the Los Angeles river point to long-duration (1 - 2 min) and long-period (2 - 8 s) shaking, which could have a severe impact on present-day tall buildings, especially in the mid-height range. To assess the risk posing tall steel moment-frame buildings from an 1857 -like earthquake on the San Andreas fault, a nite source model of the magnitude 7. 9 November 3, 2002 Denali fault earthquake is mapped on to the San Andreas fault with rupture initiating at Parkeld in Central California and propagating a distance of about 290 km in a south-easterly direction. As the rupture proceeds down south from Parkeld and hits the big bend on the San Andreas fault, it sheds off a signicant amount of energy into the San Fernando valley, generating large amplitude ground motion there. A good portion of this energy spills over into the Los Angeles basin with many cities along the coast such as Santa Monica and Seal Beach and more inland areas going east from Seal beach towards Anaheim experiencing long-duration shaking. In addition, the tail-end of the rupture sheds energy from SH/Love waves into the Baldwin Park-La Puente region, which is bounded by a line of mountains that creates a mini-basin, further amplifying the ground motion. The peak velocity is of the order of 1 m. s in the Los Angeles basin, including downtown Los Angeles, and 2 m. s in the San Fernando valley. Signicant displacements occur in the basins but not in the mountains. The peak displacements are in the neighborhood of 1 m in the Los Angeles basin and 2 m in the San Fernando valley. The ground motion simulation is performed using the spectral element method based seismic wave propagation program, SPECFEM 3 D. To study the effects of the ground motion simulated at 636 sites (spread across southern California, spaced at about 3. 5 km each way), computer models of an existing 18 -story steel moment-frame building and a redesigned building with the same conguration (redesigned to current standards using the 1997 Uniform Building Code) are analyzed using the nonlinear structural analysis program, FRAME 3 D. For these analyses, the building Y direction is aligned with the geographical north direction. As expected, the existing building model fares much worse than the redesigned building model. Fracture occurs in at least 25 % of the connections in this building when located in the San Fernando valley. About 10 % of connections fracture in the building when located in downtown Los Angeles and the mid-Wilshire district (Beverly Hills), while the numbers are about 20 % when it is located in Santa Monica, west Los Angeles, Inglewood, Alhambra, Baldwin Park, La Puente, Downey, Norwalk, Brea, Fullerton, Anaheim and Seal Beach. The peak interstory drifts in the middle-third and bottom-third of the existing building are far greater than the top-third pointing to damage being localized to the lower oors. The localization of damage in the lower oors rather than the upper oors could potentially be worse because of the risk of more oors <b>pancaking</b> on top of each other if a single story gives way. Consistent with the extent of fracture observed, the peak drifts in the existing building exceed 0. 10 when located in the San Fernando valley, Baldwin Park and neighboring cities, Santa Monica, west Los Angeles and neighboring cities, Norwalk and neighboring cities, and Seal Beach and neighboring cities, which is well into the postulated collapse regime. When located in downtown Los Angeles and the mid-Wilshire district, the building would barely satisfy the collapse prevention criteria set by FEMA [4] with peak drifts of about 0. 05. The performance of the newly designed 18 -story steel building is signicantly better than the existing building for the entire region. However, the new building still has signicant drifts indicative of serious damage when located in the San Fernando valley or the Baldwin Park area. When located in coastal cities (such as Santa Monica, Seal Beach etc.), the Wilshire-corridor (west Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, etc.), the mid-city region (Downey, Norwalk, etc.) or the booming Orange County cities of Anaheim and Santa Ana, it has peak drifts of about 0. 05, once again barely satisfying the FEMA collapse prevention criteria [5]. In downtown Los Angeles it does not undergo much damage in this scenario. Thus, even though this building has been designed according to the latest code, it suffers damage that would necessitate closure for some time following the earthquake in most areas, but this should be expected since this is a large earthquake and building codes are written to limit the loss of life and ensure "collapse prevention" for such large earthquakes, but not necessarily limit damage. Unfortunately, widespread closures such as this could cripple the regional economy in the event of such an earthquake. A second scenario considered in the study involves the same Denali earthquake source mapped to the San Andreas fault but with rupture initiating in the south and propagating to the north (with the largest amount of slip occurring to the north in Central California) instead of the other way around. The results of such a scenario indicate that ground shaking would be far less severe demonstrating the effects of directivity and slip distribution in dictating the level of ground shaking and the associated damage in buildings. The peak drifts in existing and redesigned building models are in the range of 0. 02 - 0. 04 indicating that there is no signicant danger of collapse. However, damage would still be signicant enough to warrant building closures and compromise life safety in some instances. The ground motion simulation and the structural damage modeling procedures are validated using data from the January 17, 1994, Northridge earthquake while the band-limited nature of the ground motion simulation (limited to a shortest period of 2 s by the current state of knowledge of the 3 -D Earth structure) is shown to have no signicant effect on the response of the two tall buildings considered here with the use of observed records from the 1999 Chi Chi earthquake in Taiwan and the 2001 Tokachi-Oki earthquake in Japan...|$|E
