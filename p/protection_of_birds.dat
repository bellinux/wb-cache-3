5|$|The Royal Society for the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Birds</b> {{was formed}} in Didsbury in 1889.|$|E
5|$|Emily Williamson, {{a pioneer}} of {{wildlife}} protection, was a resident of Didsbury from 1882 to 1912. She founded the Plumage League in 1889 {{and went on to}} co-found the Royal Society for the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Birds</b> (RSPB) in 1904. In 1989 a plaque was placed on her former home, the Croft, to honour her work on the centenary of her organisation.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Skelton {{made several}} {{specials}} for HBO including Freddie the Freeloader's Christmas Dinner (1981) and the Funny Faces series of specials. He gave a Royal Command Performance for the Royal Society for the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Birds</b> in 1984, which was later {{shown in the}} U.S. on HBO. A portion {{of one of his}} last interviews, conducted by Steven F. Zambo, was broadcast as part of the 2005 PBS special The Pioneers of Primetime.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, for example, {{the species}} almost became extinct in East Anglia, where the {{chemicals}} were most widely used; in western and northern {{parts of the}} country, where the pesticides were not used, there were no declines. The Royal Society for the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Birds</b> bought its Coombes Valley nature reserve in Staffordshire {{because it was the}} only Eurasian sparrowhawk breeding site left in the English Midlands.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the river}} {{mouth and the}} River Witham, a large expanse of {{saltmarsh}} provides breeding grounds for common redshank, Eurasian oystercatcher and reed bunting in the summer, and Eurasian wigeon, mallard, common shelduck and common teal in the winter. Birds of prey such as hen harrier and merlin feed on the flocks of linnet and twite, while the mudflats support dunlin, whimbrel, and bar-tailed godwit. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust have a reserve there, which is next to RSPB Frampton Marsh, a reserve managed by the Royal Society for the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Birds.</b>|$|E
5|$|From January to April 2009, the Scottish Government {{conducted}} a trial translocation of Eurasian sparrowhawks from around racing pigeon lofts in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Kilmarnock, Stirling and Dumfries. The trial, which cost £25,000, {{was supported by}} the Scottish Homing Union, representing the country's 3,500 pigeon fanciers. The experiment was originally scheduled for early in 2008 but was postponed because it would have impinged on the birds' breeding season. It was criticised by the government's own ecological adviser, Dr Ian Bainbridge, the government body Scottish Natural Heritage and organisations including the Royal Society for the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Birds</b> and the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.|$|E
50|$|With {{five hundred}} million birds {{migrating}} through Israel's skies twice a year, nature lovers {{have begun to}} take note of Israel's unique potential as an ornithology superpower. SPNI, through its Israel Ornithological Center (IOC) and International Center for the Study <b>of</b> <b>Bird</b> Migration (ICSBM), leads Israel’s partnership in the world of wildlife preservation and <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> species threatened by urbanization and economic development.|$|R

5|$|National nature {{reserves}} in England (NNR) are designated under Part III of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 that are {{deemed to be}} of national importance by Natural England as key places for wildlife and natural features in England using section 35(1) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. They were established to protect the most significant areas of habitat and of geological formations. NNRs are managed {{on behalf of the}} nation, many by Natural England themselves, but also by non-governmental organisations, including Avon Wildlife Trust or the Somerset Wildlife Trust, the National Trust, and the Royal Society for the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Birds.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plume {{harvesting}} {{became a}} dangerous business. The Audubon Society became {{concerned with the}} amount of hunting being done in rookeries in the mangrove forests. In 1902, they hired a warden, Guy Bradley, to watch the rookeries around Cuthbert Lake. Bradley had lived in Flamingo within the Everglades, and was murdered in 1905 by one of his neighbors after he tried to prevent him from hunting. <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> was the reason for establishing the first wildlife refuge when President Theodore Roosevelt set Pelican Island as a sanctuary in 1903.|$|E
5|$|The {{plight of}} {{albatross}} and large seabirds, {{as well as}} other marine creatures, being taken as bycatch by long-line fisheries, has been addressed by a large number of non-governmental organizations (including BirdLife International, the American Bird Conservancy and the Royal Society for the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Birds).</b> This led to the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, a legally binding treaty designed to protect these threatened species, which has been ratified by eleven countries as of 2008 (namely Argentina, Australia, Chile, Ecuador, France, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, South Africa, Spain and the United Kingdom).|$|E
50|$|It {{was founded}} in 1957, though it was preceded by a similar body with the same name which {{operated}} from 1920 to 1935. It is BirdLife International’s Norwegian partner organisation. Key activities of the society include the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> habitats, running conservation projects, educating the public and publishing membership magazines. It has about 9000 members and four staff and is based in Trondheim.|$|R

5|$|Although the red-throated loon {{is not a}} {{globally}} threatened species, as it has a {{large population}} and a significant range, there are populations which appear to be declining. Numbers counted in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service surveys in Alaska show a 53% population decline between 1971 and 1993, for example, and survey count numbers have dropped in continental Europe as well. In Scotland, on the other hand, the population increased by some 16% between 1994 and 2006, according to surveys done by the Royal Society for the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Birds</b> and Scottish Natural Heritage. In 2002, Wetlands International estimated a global population of 490,000 to 1,500,000individuals; global population trends have not been quantified.|$|E
5|$|Governments and {{conservation}} groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that preserve and restore bird habitat, or by establishing captive populations for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird {{that would otherwise}} have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the California condor and Norfolk parakeet. The British Royal Society for the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Birds,</b> founded as the Plumage League in 1889 to protect birds such as the egret from hunting for their plumes, used in fashion, has grown to have over a million members; it has been followed by similar societies in other countries. A more specialised organisation, the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, works to conserve waterfowl and their wetland habitats, with projects around the world.|$|E
5|$|That year, William Stearn {{succeeded in}} obtaining a {{scholarship}} to the local Cambridge High School for Boys on Hills Road, close to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, which he attended for eight years till he was eighteen. The school had an excellent reputation for biology education, {{and while he was}} there, he was encouraged by Mr Eastwood, a biology teacher who recognised his talents. The school also provided him with a thorough education in both Latin and Greek. He became secretary of the school Natural History Society, won an essay prize from the Royal Society for the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Birds</b> and spent much of his time at the Botanic Garden. Stearn also gained horticultural experience by working as a gardener's boy during his school holidays, to supplement the family income.|$|E

50|$|In Victorian times British finches were {{hugely popular}} as cage birds {{throughout}} the British Isles, often replacing canaries. Due {{to a lack}} <b>of</b> <b>protection,</b> thousands <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> were captured for the pet trade every year.|$|R
50|$|Activities {{include an}} ongoing {{campaign}} against the illegal <b>bird</b> trapping <b>of</b> wild <b>birds,</b> the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> Important <b>Bird</b> Areas, the establishment <b>of</b> Special <b>Protection</b> Areas under the European Union’s Birds Directive, {{and the promotion of}} environmentally friendly agriculture.|$|R
5|$|Because of the {{wildlife}} {{importance of the}} area, {{much of what is}} now the SSSI has been protected in nature reserves, starting in 1912 when Charles Rothschild bought Blakeney Point and donated it to the National Trust, which has managed it since. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites (Snettisham, Titchwell, Holkham, Morston Quay, Blakeney and Cley) found that 39per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit. The 7.7million day visitors and 5.5million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122million, and created the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs. Titchwell Marsh (Royal Society for the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Birds),</b> Cley Marshes (Norfolk Wildlife Trust) and Holkham National Nature Reserve each attract 100,000 or more visitors annually. The SSSI ownership outside the listed areas is a mixture of private land and areas owned by the National Trust or wildfowling associations which are not actively managed as nature reserves.|$|E
5|$|Populations of the {{peregrine}} falcon have bounced back {{in most parts}} of the world. In Britain, there has been a recovery of populations since the crash of the 1960s. This has been greatly assisted by conservation and protection work led by the Royal Society for the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Birds.</b> The RSPB has estimated that there are 1,402 breeding pairs in the UK. Peregrines now breed in many mountainous and coastal areas, especially in the west and north, and nest in some urban areas, capitalising on the urban feral pigeon populations for food. In Southampton, a nest prevented restoration of mobile telephony services for several months, after Vodafone engineers despatched to repair a faulty transmitter mast discovered a nest in the mast, and were prevented by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, on pain of a possible prison sentence, from proceeding with repairs until the chicks fledged. In many parts of the world {{peregrine falcon}}s have adapted to urban habitats, nesting on cathedrals, skyscraper window ledges, tower blocks, and the towers of suspension bridges. Many of these nesting birds are encouraged, sometimes gathering media attention and often monitored by cameras.|$|E

25|$|A pair of {{peregrine}} falcons nest {{on top of}} the building. These {{birds are}} rare, but they are often seen flying around Woking. The Royal Society for the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Birds</b> requested that people should not disturb the pair of falcons.|$|E
25|$|At Greylake the Royal Society for the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Birds</b> has {{a reserve}} {{covering}} , where birds including curlews, lapwings, snipe and redshanks {{can be seen}} in summer, with Bewick's swans, golden plovers, shovellers, teals and wigeons arriving in the winter.|$|E
