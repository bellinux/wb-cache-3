40|$|SummaryThe DNA uptake {{competence}} (Com) {{system of}} the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is considered nonfunctional. There are no known conditions for DNA transformation, and the Com master activator gene, comK, is interrupted by a temperate prophage. Here, we show that the L.  monocytogenes Com system is required during infection to promote bacterial escape from macrophage phagosomes {{in a manner that}} is independent of DNA uptake. Further, we find that regulation of the Com system relies on the formation of a functional comK gene via <b>prophage</b> <b>excision.</b> <b>Prophage</b> <b>excision</b> is specifically induced during intracellular growth, primarily within phagosomes, yet, in contrast to classic prophage induction, progeny virions are not produced. This study presents the characterization of an active prophage that serves as a genetic switch to modulate the virulence of its bacterial host in the course of infection...|$|E

40|$|The Escherichia coli K- 12 alpA gene product, when overproduced from a {{multicopy}} plasmid, {{leads to}} {{suppression of the}} capsule overproduction and UV sensitivity phenotypes of cells mutant for the Lon ATP-dependent protease. This suppression has previously been shown to correlate with increased in vivo activity of a previously unknown energy-dependent proteolytic activity capable of degrading Lon substrates, the Alp protease. We show in an accompanying paper that alpA, which has homology to a short open reading frame in bacteriophage P 4, acts as a positive transcriptional regulator of slpA, a gene linked to alpA and necessary for suppression of lon mutants (J. E. Trempy, J. E. Kirby, and S. Gottesman, J. Bacteriol. 176 : 2061 - 2067). The sequence of slpA suggests that it encodes an integrase gene closely related to P 4 int and that both alpA and slpA {{are part of a}} cryptic P 4 -like prophage. AlpA expression increases SlpA synthesis. Increased SlpA leads, in turn, to the excision and loss of the cryptic <b>prophage.</b> <b>Excision</b> is dependent on integration host factor as well as on SlpA. <b>Prophage</b> <b>excision</b> is necessary but not sufficient for full expression of the Alp protease. A second function (named AHA) allows full protease expression; this function can be provided by the kanamycin resistance element from Tn 903 when the element is present on a multicopy plasmid. Excision and loss of the cryptic prophage apparently allow expression of the Alp protease by inactivating a small stable RNA (10 Sa RNA) encoded by the ssrA gene. The precursor of this RNA has its 3 ' end within the cryptic prophage; the mature 3 ' end lies within the prophage attL site. Inactivation of ssrA by insertional mutagenesis is sufficient to allow expression of the suppressing Alp protease, even {{in the presence of the}} cryptic prophage. Therefore, 10 Sa RNA acts as a negative regulator of protease synthesis or activity, and <b>prophage</b> <b>excision</b> must inactivate this inhibitory function of the RNA...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} whether the early replication of Mu prophage DNA proceeds beyond the termini of the prophage into hose DNA, the amounts of both Mu DNA and the prophage-adjacent host DNA sequences were measured using a DNA-DNA annealing assay after induction of the Mu vegetative cycle. Whereas Mu-specific DNA synthesis began 6 to 8 min after induction, no amplification of the adjacent DNA sequences was observed. These data suggest that early Mu-induced DNA synthesis is constrained {{within the boundaries of}} the Mu prophage. Since prophage Mu DNA does not undergo a <b>prophage</b> lambda-like <b>excision</b> from its original site after induction (E. Ljungquist and A. I. Bukhari, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74 : 3143 [...] 3147, 1977), we propose the existence of a control mechanism which excludes prophage-adjacent sequences from the initial mu prophage replication. The frequencies of the Mu prophage-adjacent DNA sequences, relative to other Escherichia coli genes, were not observed to change after the onset of Mu-specific DNA replication. This suggests that these regions remain associated with the host chromosome and continue to be replicated by the chromosomal replication fork. Therefore, we conclude that both the Mu prophage and adjacent host sequences are maintained in the host chromosome, rather than on an extrachromosomal form containing Mu and host DNA...|$|R

40|$|International audienceProphages {{represent}} a large fraction of prokaryotic genomes and often provide new functions to their hosts, in particular virulence and fitness. How prokaryotic cells maintain such gene providers is central for understanding bacterial genome evolution by horizontal transfer. <b>Prophage</b> <b>excision</b> occurs through site-specific recombination mediated by a prophage-encoded integrase. In addition, a recombination directionality factor (or excisionase) directs the reaction toward excision and prevents the phage genome from being reintegrated. In this work, {{we describe the}} role of the transcription termination factor Rho in prophage maintenance through control of the synthesis of transcripts that mediate recombination directionality factor expression and, thus, excisive recombination.

40|$|Excision of transposable genetic {{elements}} from host DNA {{is different from}} the classical prophage lambda type of excision in that it occurs at low frequency and is mostly imprecise; only a minority of excision events restores the wild-type host sequences. In bacteriophage Mu, a highly efficient transposon, imprecise excision is 10 – 100 times more frequent than precise excision. We have examined a large number of these excision events by starting with Mucts X mutants located in the Z gene of the lac operon of Escherichia coli. Mucts X mutants are defective <b>prophages</b> whose <b>excision</b> occurs at a measurable frequency. Imprecise excision was monitored by selecting for melibiose+ (Mel+) phenotype, which requires only a functioning lacY gene. Mel+ revertants exhibit an array of DNA rearrangements and fall in four main classes, the predominant one being comprised of revertants that have no detectable Mu DNA. Most of these revertants can further revert to Lac+. Perhaps 5 base-pair duplications, originally present at prophage-host junctions, are left in these lacZ-Y+ revertants, and they can be further repaired to lacZ+. Another class has, in addition to the loss of Mu DNA, deletions that extend generally, but not always, to only one side of the prophage. The other two classes of revertants, surprisingly, still have Mu DNA in the lacZ gene. One class has deletions in the Z gene, whereas, no deletions can be detected in the other. Many of the revertants in the last class can further revert to lacZ+, indicating that the lacY gene must have been turned on by a rearrangement within Mu DNA. Apparently, all of the detectable precise and most of the imprecise excision events require functioning of the Mu A gene. We suggest that a block in large-scale Mu replication allows the excision process to proceed...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{induction}} of λc 857 - 434 hy and λc 857 - 80 hy tandem dilysogens {{results in}} replication {{not only of}} the λ, which is induced, but also of the other phage. Nevertheless, the latter remains under immunity control, since: (a) a superinfecting phage of that immunity fails to replicate; (b) the genes under direct immunity control are not expressed. Replication of the non-induced phage takes place only if it is adjacent to the λ, and only if the λ itself is able to replicate: however, this replication does not require that the replicative enzymes are interchangeable between λ and the other phage. Clearly, one deals here with passive replication of a phage, {{as a part of a}} λ-driven replicon. Function Int frequently excises the whole tandem of prophages, presumably as a double length circle. Replication from this structure, followed by the action of function Ter, accounts for our results as well as for those of Whitfleld & Appleyard (1958). The situation described here is in many respects similar to that analyzed by Gottesman & Yarmolinsky (1968). In their case, however, passive replication takes place in situ because int- mutations in the <b>prophages</b> prevent early <b>excision,</b> and particles of only one immunity are found in the yield. © 1970.

40|$|Both {{prophage}} {{integration in}} bacteriophage P 2 and the reverse event, <b>prophage</b> <b>excision,</b> {{are known to}} require a specific phage gene product, the so-called int function.

Prophage P 2, on the other hand, is not excised from the host chromosome even in a derepressed lysogen unless int function is supplied by a superinfecting phage. Thus, the int function of P 2 is expressed constitutively by the superinfecting phage, but is not expressed by the prophage {{even in the absence of}} phage repressor.

Formation of these phages was possible because the P 22 prophage recognizes an attachment site in the E. coli F' prolac episome. Salmonella strains carrying the F' prolac episome can be lysogenized by P 22 so as to leave the prophage inserted into the E. coli material of the F' factor.

In wild-type cells, terminal hyper- (TH) recombination is prophage specific and undetectable by a test involving deletion of chromosomal segments between repeats identical to those used for prophage insertion. TH recombination is, however, detected in both excision and deletion assays when Deltadif, xerC, or ftsK mutations inhibit dimer resolution: lack of specialized resolution apparently results in recombinogenic lesions near dif. We also observed that the presence near dif of the prophage, in the orientation causing TH recombination, inhibits dif resolution activity. By its recombinogenic effect, this inhibition explains the enhanced <b>prophage</b> <b>excision</b> in wild-type cells. The primary effect of the prophage is probably an alteration of the dimer resolution regional control, which requires that dif is flanked by suitably oriented (polarized) stretches of DNA. Our model postulates that the prophage inserted near dif in the deleterious orientation disturbs chromosome polarization {{on the side of}} the site where it is integrated, because lambda DNA, like the chromosome, is polarized by sequence elements.

Interestingly, NMR titration experiments showed that binding of DnaJ involves specific regions of the TorI structure. These regions, mainly composed of -helices, are located on a surface opposite the DNA-binding site.

The use of a <b>prophage</b> <b>excision</b> assay, which allows variation of the site of recombination and interference with local polarity, allowed us to find that cooperating FtsK-dependent and -independent processes localize dif at the septum and that DNA mobilization by FtsK is oriented by the polarity probably due to skewed sequence motifs of the mobilized material...|$|E

Four erf- mutants examined in detail fall into one complementation group; erf+ is dominant to erf-. The erf gene {{is located in the}} “early” region of the phage genetic map. The phenotype of erf- mumnts after infection of ret- hosts includes failurn to grow, to lysogenize, and to sustain phage DNA synthesis beyond about one round of replication. Late phago functions appear to be expressed normally by erf- mutants. Circularization of the infecting circularly permuted, t,erminally repetitious phage DNA seems to be the essential step for which recombination is required. This idea is supported by the observation that an erf- phage can grow normally in ret- cytoplasm after induction of a lysogen; in this case the DXA is presumably circularized by the <b>prophage</b> <b>excision</b> mechanism. We conclude that recombination is essential to growth because the linear infecting DNA must be circularized by recombination. The inability to sustain DNA synthesis in the absence of recombination suggosts that circularization is topologically essential to successful replication of the phage genome. 1...|$|E
40|$|Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is a pore-forming, bi-component toxin {{secreted}} by Staphylococcus aureus strains epidemiologically {{associated with}} {{diseases such as}} necrotizing pneumonia and skin and soft-tissue infections. Here we demonstrate that transcription of the phage-encoded PVL (encoded in the luk-PV operon) is dependent on two major determinants: the phage life-cycle and the host chromosomal background. Mitomycin C induction of PVL-encoding prophages from different community-acquired MRSA strains led {{to an increase in}} the amount of luk-PV mRNA as a result of read-through transcription from latent phage promoters and an increase in phage copy numbers. Failing <b>prophage</b> <b>excision</b> was reflected in a constant expression of luk-PV {{as in the case of}} strain USA 300, suggesting that phi Sa 2 USA 300 is a replication-defective prophage. Additionally, we could show that luk-PV transcription is influenced by the S. aureus global virulence regulators agr and sae. We found a strong impact of the host background on prophage induction and replication when analysing PVL phages in different S. aureus strains. For example phage phi Sa 2 mw was greatly induced by mitomycin C in its native host MW 2 and in strain Newman but to a considerably lesser extent in strains 8325 - 4, RN 6390 and ISP 479 c. This discrepancy was not linked to the SOS response of the bacteria since recA transcription did not vary between the strains. These results suggest a fine tuning between certain phages and their host, with major impact on the expression of phage-encoded virulence genes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUpon {{infection}} of its host Escherichia coli, satellite bacteriophage P 4 can integrate its genome into the bacterial chromosome by Int-mediated site-specific recombination between the attP and the attB sites. The opposite event, excision, may either occur spontaneously or be induced by a superinfecting P 2 helper phage. In this work, we {{demonstrate that the}} product of the P 4 vis gene, a regulator of the P 4 late promoters PLL and Psid, is needed for <b>prophage</b> <b>excision.</b> This conclusion is supported by the following evidence: (i) P 4 mutants carrying either a frameshift mutation or a deletion of the vis gene were unable to excise both spontaneously or upon P 2 phage superinfection; (ii) expression of the Vis protein from a plasmid induced P 4 prophage excision; (iii) excision depended on a functional integrase (Int) protein, thus suggesting that Vis is involved {{in the formation of the}} excision complex, rather than in the excision recombination event per se; (iv) Vis protein bound P 4 DNA in the attP region at two distinct boxes (Box I and Box II), located between the int gene and the attP core region, and caused bending of the bound DNA. Furthermore, we mapped by primer extension the 5 ′ end of the int transcript and found that ectopic expression of Vis reduced its signal intensity, suggesting that Vis is also involved in negative regulation of the int promoter...|$|E
40|$|The P 2 Cox {{protein is}} known to repress the Pc promoter, which {{controls}} {{the expression of the}} P 2 immunity repressor C. It has also been shown that Cox can activate the late promoter PLL of the unrelated phage P 4. By this process, a P 2 phage infecting a P 4 lysogen is capable of inducing replication of the P 4 genome, an example of viral transactivation. In this report, we present evidence that Cox is also directly involved in both <b>prophage</b> <b>excision</b> and phage integration. While purified Cox, in addition to P 2 Int and Escherichia coli integration host factor, was required for attR x attL (excisive) recombination in vitro, it was inhibitory to attP x attB (integrative) recombination. The same amounts of Int and integration host factor which mediated optimal excisive recombination in vitro also mediated optimal integrative recombination. We quantified and compared the relative efficiencies of attB, attR, and attL in recombination with attP and discuss the functional implications of the results. DNase I protection experiments revealed an extended 70 -bp Cox-protected region on the right arm of attP, centered at about + 60 bp {{from the center of the}} core sequence. Gel shift assays suggest that there are two Cox binding sites within this region. Together, these data support the theory that in vivo, P 2 can exert control over the direction of recombination by either expressing Int alone or Int and Cox together...|$|E
40|$|To {{establish}} a lysogenic lifestyle, the temperate bacteriophage fC 31 integrates its genome into the chromosome of its Streptomyces host, by site-specific recombination between attP (the attachment {{site in the}} phage DNA) and attB (the chromosomal attachment site). This reaction is promoted by a phageencoded serine recombinase Int. To return to the lytic lifestyle, the prophage excises its DNA by a similar Int-mediated reaction between the recombinant sites flanking the prophage, attL and attR. fC 31 Int has been developed into a popular experimental tool for integration of transgenic DNA into the genomes of eukaryotic organisms. However, until now {{it has not been}} possible to use Int to promote the reverse reaction, excision. In many other phages, the presence of a recombination directionality factor (RDF) protein biases the phage-encoded integrase towards <b>prophage</b> <b>excision,</b> whereas absence of the RDF favours integration; but the fC 31 RDF had proved elusive. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Khaleel et al. (2011) report the identification and purification of the fC 31 RDF, and show that it both promotes excision and inhibits integration by direct protein-protein interactions with Int itself. Virulent bacteriophages destroy their host cell as they replicate and release new phage particles into the surrounding medium, but many ‘temperate ’ phages can also adopt a lysogenic lifestyle where they hide in the host cell and get passed on from generation to generation. The iconoclastic discovery that phage l integrates its DNA into the host genome to establish lysogeny was followed by a surge of groundbreaking research on the integratio...|$|E

40|$|Temperate phages infect {{bacteria}} by injecting their DNA into bacterial cells, {{where it}} becomes {{incorporated into the}} host genome as a prophage. In the genome of Bacillus subtilis 168, an active prophage, SPβ, is inserted into a polysaccharide synthesis gene, spsM. Here, we show that a rearrangement occurs during sporulation to reconstitute a functional composite spsM gene by precise excision of SPβ from the chromosome. SPβ excision requires a putative site-specific recombinase, SprA, and an accessory protein, SprB. A minimized SPβ, where all the SPβ genes were deleted, except sprA and sprB, retained the SPβ excision activity during sporulation, demonstrating that sprA and sprB are necessary and sufficient for the excision. While expression of sprA was observed during vegetative growth, sprB was induced during sporulation and upon mitomycin C treatment, which triggers the phage lytic cycle. We also demonstrated that overexpression of sprB (but not of sprA) resulted in SPβ <b>prophage</b> <b>excision</b> without triggering the lytic cycle. These results suggest that sprB is the factor that controls the timing of phage excision. Furthermore, we provide evidence that spsM {{is essential for the}} addition of polysaccharides to the spore envelope. The presence of polysaccharides on the spore surface renders the spore hydrophilic in water. This property may be beneficial in allowing spores to disperse in natural environments via water flow. A similar rearrangement occurs in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB 42, where a SPβ-like element is excised during sporulation to reconstitute a polysaccharide synthesis gene, suggesting that this type of gene rearrangement is common in spore-forming bacteria because it can be spread by phage infection...|$|E
40|$|P 22 pro- 1 and P 22 pro- 3 are {{specialized}} transducing derivatives of phage P 22 {{that carry}} the proA and proB genes of Salmonella typhimurium. These genes lie immediately {{adjacent to the}} prophage attachment site on the bacterial chromosome. By examining DNA heteroduplexes in the electron microscope, we found that DNA molecules from P 22 pro- 1 and P 22 pro- 3 each contain a substitution which adds length to the composite genome making the intracellular replicated genome too long {{to fit into a}} single phage particle. In this respect, and in many of their biological properties, the proline-transducing phages resemble P 22 Tc- 10, another specialized transducing phage with an oversize, intracellular replicated genome which carries a tetracycline-resistance determinant from an R-factor. —Unlike P 22 Tc- 10, however, P 22 pro- 1 and P 22 pro- 3 fail to integrate normally during lysogenizing infections, even when provided with all known integration functions. These results suggest that the proline substitutions have created a defect in the phage attachment site and suggest that the Campbell model for the formation of specialized transducing phages is applicable to phage P 22 with the additional feature that oversize genomes can be produced and propagated. —A physical and genetic map of the P 22 genome near the prophage attachment site was constructed which shows that the insertion from the R-factor in P 22 Tc- 10 is not at the attachment site: it is therefore unlikely that P 22 Tc- 10 was formed in an abnormal <b>prophage</b> <b>excision</b> event as envisioned in the Campbell model, but was instead the result of a direct translocation from the R-plasmid to P 22...|$|E
