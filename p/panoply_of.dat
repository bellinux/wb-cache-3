Apart from Bourdieu’s definition of the notion, Rapport and Overing (2003 : 2) emphasized those transposable dispositions which generate structured social practices. Understanding the conditions of habitus allows the generator of discourses, endowed with agency, to insert in them manipulative or propagandistic ingredients. Thus, literature can very well function as a platform for public relations or advertising. Every author assesses readers’ objectives and needs before elaborating narratives. Postmodernism also resorted to multi-layered discourses in the post-totalitarian epoch and revived the importance of cultural symbols (flags, statues, and religious icons), exactly as in the medieval epoch (cf. Sammuel P. Huntington. The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, 1997). In order to deconstruct the toxic discourses of a macdonaldized and disneylandized post-industrial society, reception has to resort to mediated discourse analysis, as it includes the social identities and social relationships made possible by certain discourses (Hyland and Paltridge 2011 : 10).

Holden characterizes the work as a literary memoir of being and becoming; a set of lessons about life and musings on the human condition by a writer searching to find his way. The book opens by outlining a philosophy for undertaking the journey of life—what Holden calls “peripatacity”—and then enumerates a set of rules for conducting the journey. Subsequent chapters focus on the processes, people, places, predicaments, and philosophies encountered along life’s road. A final chapter personifies the journey by following the progress of the author, his wife and bi-cultural children on road trips through their native America and Japan—trips that prompt reflections on childhood, death, love, fate, God, happiness, family, home, place, personal growth, and the meaning of life. Throughout, Peripatetic Postcards operates at two levels: seeking to convey the <b>panoply</b> <b>of</b> human experience for those looking to broaden their understanding of the human condition in an increasingly globalized world, while also providing a model for discovery, personified in the author's experience.|$|E

Constantine divided the {{expanded}} city, like Rome, into 14 regions, and ornamented it with public works worthy of an imperial metropolis. Yet, at first, Constantine's new Rome {{did not have}} all the dignities of old Rome. It possessed a proconsul, rather than an urban prefect. It had no praetors, tribunes, or quaestors. Although it did have senators, they held the title clarus, not clarissimus, like those of Rome.

In similar fashion, many of the greatest works of Greek and Roman art were soon to be seen in its squares and streets.

40|$|Introduction: The {{genesis of}} cancer {{appears to be}} a complex matter, which is not simply based upon few genetic abnormalities/alteration. In fact, {{irregular}} microvasculature and aberrant interstitium of solid tumors impose significant pathophysiologic barrier functions against cancer treatment modalities, hence novel strategies should holistically target bioelements of tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, we provide some overview and insights on TME and important strategies used to control the impacts of such pathophysiologic barriers. Results: We reviewed all relevant literature for the impacts of tumor interstitium and microvasculature within the TME as well as the significance of the implemented strategies. Results: While tumorigenesis initiation seems to be in close relation with an emergence of hypoxia and alterations in epigenetic/genetic materials, large <b>panoplies</b> <b>of</b> molecular events emerge as intricate networks during oncogenesis to form unique lenient TME in favor of tumor progression. Within such irregular interstitium, immune system displays defective surveillance functionalities against malignant cells. Solid tumors show multifacial traits with coadaptation and self-regulation potentials, which bestow profound resistance against the currently used conventional chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents that target solely one face of the disease. Conclusion: The cancerous cells attain unique abilities to form its permissive microenvironment, wherein (a) extracellular pH is dysregulated towards acidification, (b) extracellular matrix (ECM) is deformed, (c) stromal cells are cooperative with cancer cells, (d) immune system mechanisms are defective, (e) non-integrated irregular microvasculature with pores (120 - 1200 nm) are formed, and (h) interstitial fluid pressure is high. All these phenomena are against cancer treatment modalities. As a result, to control such abnormal pathophysiologic traits, novel cancer therapy strategies need to be devised using multifunctional nanomedicines and theranostics...|$|R

This consists in designing the architecture and abstractions of an application and coding them in a programming language. The discipline of programming has two essential parts: a technology and its scientific foundation. The technology consists of tools, techniques, and standards, allowing to do programming. The science consists of a broad and deep theory with predictive power, allowing to understand programming. The science should be practical, that is, able to explain the technology, making it useful for a practicing programmer. Teaching programming means to teach both the science and the technology. Surprisingly, we find that programming is almost never taught in this way. Surveying existing textbooks, we find that programming is taught in three different ways...|$|R

Mycenaean armies shared several common features with other contemporary Late Bronze Age powers: they were initially based on heavy infantry, with spears, large shields and in some occasions armor. In the 13th century BC, Mycenaean units underwent a transformation in tactics and weaponry and became more uniform and flexible and their weapons became smaller and lighter.

Consecrated on 1 July 1635, both the abbey church, dedicated to Christ the Saviour, {{as well as the}} monastery were very richly furnished. The church, built according to the rules of the Carmelite Order, was a brick building, on the plan of the Latin cross with the south facing a two-span presbytery and a one-nave, twospan main body, flanked by a row of side chapels, interconnected by narrow passages and open to the main nave with arcades enclosed by archivolts and sustained by pillars. The interior was decorated with rich stucco decoration, made by John the Baptist Falconi, composed, among others, <b>of</b> <b>panoplies</b> <b>of</b> Turkish motifs, which directly referred to the victory at Chocim.

It was built in early Baroque style on the set of a regular square with dimensions 61 by 62 m, with three internal courtyards and cross and tunnel vaulted interior.
