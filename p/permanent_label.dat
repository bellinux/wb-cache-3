40|$|The "Pareto {{principle}} " has by {{this time}} become deeply rooted in our industrial literature. It is a shorthand name for the phenomenon that in any population which contributes to a common effect, a relative few of the contributors account {{for the bulk of}} the effect.

40|$|International audienceAluminum oxyhydroxide (alum) is a {{crystalline}} compound {{widely used}} as an immunologic adjuvant of vaccines. Concerns linked to alum particles have emerged following recognition of their causative role in the so-called macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) lesion in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis, revealing an unexpectedly long-lasting biopersistence of alum within immune cells and a fundamental misconception of its biodisposition. Evidence that aluminum-coated particles phagocytozed in the injected muscle and its draining lymph nodes can disseminate within phagocytes throughout the body and slowly accumulate in the brain further suggested that alum safety should be evaluated in the long term. However, lack of specific staining makes difficult the assessment of low quantities of bona fide alum adjuvant particles in tissues. Methods: We explored the feasibility of using fluorescent functionalized nanodiamonds (mfNDs) as a <b>permanent</b> <b>label</b> of alum (Alhydrogel ®). mfNDs have a specific and perfectly photostable fluorescence based on the presence within the diamond lattice of nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV centers). As the NV center does not bleach, it allows the microspectrometric detection of mfNDs at very low levels and in the long-term. We thus developed fluorescent nanodiamonds functionalized by hyperbranched polyglycerol (mfNDs) allowing good coupling and stability of alum:mfNDs (AluDia) complexes. Specificities of AluDia complexes were comparable to the whole reference vaccine (anti-hepatitis B vaccine) in terms of particle size and zeta potential. Results: In vivo, AluDia injection was followed by prompt phagocytosis and AluDia particles remained easily detectable by the specific signal of the fND particles in the injected muscle, draining lymph nodes, spleen, liver and brain. In vitro, mfNDs had low toxicity on THP- 1 cells and AluDia showed cell toxicity similar to alum alone. Expectedly, AluDia elicited autophagy, and allowed highly specific detection of small amounts of alum in autophagosomes...|$|E
40|$|Cerebellar {{cortical}} functions rely on precisely arranged cytoarchitectures {{composed of}} several distinct types of neurons and glias. Studies {{have indicated that}} cerebellar excitatory and inhibitory neurons have distinct spatial origins, the upper rhombic lip (uRL) and ventricular zone (VZ), respectively, and that different types of neurons have different birthdates. However, the spatiotemporal relationship between uRL/VZ progenitors and their final phenotype remains poorly understood due to technical limitations. To address this issue, we performed in utero electroporation (IUE) of fluorescent protein plasmids using mouse embryos to label uRL/VZ progenitors at specific developmental stages, and observed labeled cells at maturity. To overcome any potential dilution of the plasmids caused by progenitor division, we also utilized constructs that enable <b>permanent</b> <b>labeling</b> of cells. Cerebellar neurons and glias were labeled in a Golgi-like manner enabling ready identification of labeled cells.

40|$|Stimulation of preganglionic axons {{arising from}} {{different}} levels of the thoracic spinal cord causes different effects on end-organs supplied by the superior cervical ganglion (Langley, 1892; Nja & Purves, 1977 a; Lichtman, Purves & Yip, 1979). For example, stimulation of the first thoracic ventral root (T 1) causes pupillary dilatation and widening of the palpebral fissure; stimulation of T 4, on the other hand, has {{little effect on the}} eye, even though axons arising from this level innervate about as many superior cervical ganglion cells as those from T 1. Thus ganglion cell innervation is selective. (1) Three months after crushing the major post-ganglionic branches of the superior cervical ganglion this differential effectiveness is lost: T 1 and T 4 stimulation have approximately equal effects on the end-organs of the eye. (2) In normal animals, the cellular counterpart of selective end-organ effects is the innervation of each ganglion cell by a contiguous subset of the spinal segments that innervate the ganglion as a whole. One of these segments is usually dominant, the strength of innervation from adjacent segments falling off as a function of distance from the dominant one (Nja & Purves, 1977 a). Intracellular recordings from ganglion cells 3 months after post-ganglionic axotomy showed that this selective pattern is re-established. (3) Since the innervation of ganglion cells appears normal, the abnormal end-organ responses after post-ganglionic axotomy suggest that ganglion cell axons are not limited to their original targets during peripheral re-innervation. This suggestion is supported by the finding that ganglion cells sending axons to different peripheral destinations via the second and third cervical spinal nerves were no longer distinguishable {{on the basis of their}} segmented inputs 3 months after post-ganglionic axotomy. (4) Similar results were obtained when the preganglionic cervical trunk was cut at the same time as the post-ganglionic axons were crushed; the pattern of end-organ responses was abnormal, whereas individual ganglion cells were re-innervated according to the rules of contiguity and segmental dominance. (5) These results indicate that ganglion cells do not undergo a compensatory change in the segmental innervation they receive when their axons regenerate to targets different from, or in addition to those they originally innervated, even when an entirely new set of ganglionic connexions is formed. This suggests that ganglion cells, or some aspect of their immediate environment, possess a <b>permanent</b> <b>label</b> that determines the segmental innervation they receive...|$|E

However, in a nestin-GFP reporter mouse we found proliferating cells within the corpus callosum/alveus region expressing nestin and glial fibrillary acidic protein similar to precursor cells in the neighboring neurogenic region of the adult dentate gyrus. Within 3 weeks of BrdU administration, BrdU-positive nestin-GFP-expressing protoplasmic astrocytes emerged in CA 1. Similar to precursor cells isolated from the dentate gyrus and the SVZ, nestin-GFP-expressing cells from corpus callosum/alveus were self-renewing and multipotent in vitro, whereas cells isolated from CA 1 were not. Nestin-GFP-expressing cells in CA 1 differentiated into postmitotic astrocytes characterized by S 100 beta expression. No new neurons were found in CA 1.

30|$|A {{wide variety}} of scan {{detection}} methods have been surveyed in [2]. Perhaps the most influential and significant of those is that of [1], in which the TRW method is proposed. This approach {{is based on the}} observation that in the course of enumerating an unknown network, a scanner will generate a relatively large number of unsuccessful connections; legitimate traffic by contrast should generate unsuccessful traffic only rarely. By examining a ratio of successful to unsuccessful connections, robust and rapid identification of potential scanners can be achieved. A weakness of the algorithm is that a scanner can boost its successful connection count by accessing known good servers, enabling additional probing of unknown addresses prior to detection. If enough known good servers are probed first (e.g., 6 or 7 for the published TRW parameters), TRW will permanently classify the scanner as benign and will ignore any subsequent scanning activity [3]. TRW can be modified to avoid such <b>permanent</b> <b>labelling,</b> but this causes {{a significant increase in the}} computation and memory requirements [3], while still leaving open the ability for an attacker to delay being categorized as malicious by seeding scan activity with accesses to known servers. Another weakness is that TRW only operates on stateful protocols like TCP that clearly define a “failed” connection. This limitation is due to TRW classifying stateless communication as scan activity in situations where there is a lack of bi-directional communication [3].|$|R

When controlled by the rat CCSP promoter, continuous exposure of the fetus to doxycycline caused widespread recombination in conducting airway epithelial cells, including cells of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles before birth, and in both conducting and peripheral airways after birth. Neuroepithelial cells, identified by CGRP staining, were never <b>labeled.</b> Recombination and <b>permanent</b> <b>labeling</b> were observed in both ciliated and nonciliated respiratory epithelial cells, demonstrating their derivation from common progenitor cells during lung morphogenesis.

The measles virus (MeV) fusion F protein activates the alternative. The original observation of cold detergent resistant membranes sedimenting at a higher density than the membrane rafts lead us to analyse the respective distribution of F, CD 46 and C 55 molecules in what we call heavy rafts (HR) and in the classical low density membrane rafts (R). The correlation of F proteins association with HR fraction and the C 3 b deposition argue for HR-type microdomains to be a site highly favourable for the uncontrolled activation of the alternative pathway in the absence of CD 46 and CD 55 in close vicinity.

40|$|The {{epidermis}} {{of terrestrial}} vertebrates is a stratified epithelium and forms an essential protective barrier. It is continually renewed, with dead corneocytes shed {{from the surface}} and replaced from a basal keratinocyte stem cell population. Whilst mouse is the prime model system used for epidermal studies, there is increasing employment of the zebrafish to analyse epidermis development and homeostasis, however the architecture and ontogeny of the epidermis in this system are incompletely described. In particular, it is unclear if adult zebrafish epidermis is derived entirely from the basal epidermal stem cell layer, as in the mouse, or if the most superficial keratinocyte layer is a remnant of the embryonic periderm. Furthermore, a relative paucity of cellular markers and genetic reagents to label and manipulate the basal epidermal stem cell compartment has hampered research. Here we show that the type I keratin, krtt 1 c 19 e, is a suitable marker of the basal epidermal layer and identify a krtt 1 c 19 e promoter fragment able to drive strong and specific expression in this cell type. Use of this promoter to express an inducible Cre recombinase allowed <b>permanent</b> <b>labelling</b> of basal cells during embryogenesis, and demonstrated that these cells do indeed generate keratinocytes of all strata in the adult epidermis. Further deployment of the Cre-Lox system highlighted the transient nature of the embryonic periderm.

Furthermore, novel transgenic mouse-lines were generated to facilitate the analysis of these neurons in-vivo and in living-tissue preparations: The mouse-line Cofluor allows the identification of GABAergic, glycinergic as well as GgC neurons by the expression of different fluorescent proteins. This mouse-line was used to investigate the number of cells of each neuron type during development from E 15. 5 to 2. 5 month revealing a decrease of GgC neurons paralleled by an increase of glycinergic and GABAergic neurons.
