500|$|Any {{individual}} can prepare a National Register nomination, although historians and historic preservation consultants often are employed for this work. The nomination {{consists of a}} standard nomination form and contains basic information about a property's physical appearance {{and the type of}} significance embodied in the building, structure, object, site, or district. The State Historic Preservation Office receives National Register nominations and provides feedback to the nominating individual or group. After <b>preliminary</b> <b>review,</b> the SHPO sends each nomination to the state's historic review commission, which then recommends whether the State Historic Preservation Officer should send the nomination to the Keeper of the National Register. For any non-Federally owned property, only the State Historic Preservation Officer may officially nominate a property for inclusion in the National Register. After the nomination is recommended for listing in the National Register by the SHPO, the nomination is sent to the National Park Service, which approves or denies the nomination. If approved, the property is entered officially by the Keeper of the National Register into the National Register of Historic Places. Property owners are notified of the nomination during the review by the SHPO and state's historic review commission. If an owner objects to a nomination of private property, {{or in the case of}} a historic district, a majority of owners, then the property cannot be listed in the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

2500|$|The 247 was {{the first}} twin-engined {{passenger}} transport able to fly on one engine. With controllable pitch propellers (standard equipment on the 247D), the 247 could maintain [...] at maximum gross takeoff weight.

[...] Originally planned as a 14-passenger airliner powered by Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet radial engines, the <b>preliminary</b> <b>review</b> of the design concept by United Air Lines' pilots had resulted in a redesign to a smaller, less capable design configuration, powered by R-1340 wasp engines.|$|E
2500|$|During 2009 Porsche updated the 997 line-up {{including}} styling changes, {{a revised}} engine with direct injection {{and the introduction}} of the company's new [...] "PDK" [...] dual clutch transmission.

2500|$|Based on a <b>preliminary</b> <b>review</b> of FDR data, the NTSB stated {{there was}} no {{anomalous}} behavior of the engines, the autopilot, the flight director, or the autothrottle. The autothrottle control {{was found to be}} in the [...] "armed" [...] position during documentation of cockpit levers and switches, differing from both the [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off" [...] positions. Furthermore, the pilot flying's flight director (Primary Flight Display) was deactivated whereas the instructor pilot's was activated (this may prove to be significant, as deactivating neither or both Flight Directors enables and forces an autothrottle [...] "wake-up" [...] whereas deactivating only one Flight Director inhibits an autothrottle [...] "wake-up"). All three fire handles were extended; these operate safety equipment intended to put out fires on the aircraft (a handle for each engine and the auxiliary power unit). The speedbrake lever was down, showing it was not being used.|$|E
2500|$|In the Persian Gulf area, Iraq {{remained}} a problem. In June 1993 two U.S. Navy ships fired Tomahawk missiles against the headquarters building of Iraq's intelligence service in Baghdad {{in response to}} evidence of a plot to assassinate former President Bush {{during a visit to}} Kuwait. Aspin described the attack as a [...] "wake up call" [...] for Saddam Hussein. Two months later Aspin received a report on the U.S. military performance during the 1991 Gulf War, the result of a study undertaken by the House Armed Services Committee when he chaired it. The report concluded that the U.S. Central Command had greatly exaggerated damage done to Iraqi military equipment, such as tanks and naval vessels, by air strikes. Aspin also had to consider the question of health problems of U.S. service personnel who participated in the action against Iraq. He announced that a <b>preliminary</b> <b>review</b> disclosed no connection between chemical weapon agents and the reported health problems. Nevertheless, he formed a panel of outside experts to examine the issue further.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{landing gear}} of the {{aircraft}} hit the seawall short of the runway as the crew attempted to abort the landing and execute a go-around. Based on preliminary data from the flight data recorder (FDR), the NTSB said the plane's airspeed on final approach fell to 34 knots below its target approach speed of 137 knots (254km/h; 158mph). A <b>preliminary</b> <b>review</b> of FAA radar return data did not show an abnormally steep descent curve, although the crew did recognize that they began high on the final approach. At a height of , eight seconds before impact, the airspeed had dropped to [...] According to initial reports from the cockpit crew, the plane's autothrottle was set for the correct reference speed, but until the runway's precision approach path indicator (PAPI) showed them significantly below the glide path, the pilots were unaware the autothrottle was failing to maintain that speed. The instructor pilot stated that the PAPI indicated a deviation below the glide path at approximately 500 feet above ground level, and he attempted to correct it at that time. Between 500 and 200 feet, the instructor pilot also reported a lateral deviation which they attempted to correct.|$|E

2500|$|Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku hails Sword Art Online as {{the smartest}} series in recent years, praising its deep insight on the {{psychological}} aspects of virtual reality on the human psyche, its sociological views on creating a realistic economy and society in a massively multiplayer online game setting, and the writing staff's ability to juggle {{a wide variety of}} genres within the series. Eisenbeis particularly noted how the romance between Kirito and Asuna is explored bringing [...] "definition to exactly what love is like in a virtual world." [...] However, {{at the time of this}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>review,</b> he had only watched the first 12 episodes of the series. He has since gone on to review the second half of the series, lauding its excellent use of plot twists and praising its well written and believable villain. However, he felt that some of the initial positive aspects of the series were lost in the second half, such as the focus on psychological repercussions and social interactions that could be realistically seen in an online game. Criticism was also levied on the aspect of turning Asuna into a damsel in distress, stating that a female lead as strong as her was [...] "reduced to nothing but the quest item the male lead is hunting for." [...] Eisenbeis closes his review of the series by stating in regards to the two halves, [...] "Both, however, are enjoyable for what they are." ...|$|E
