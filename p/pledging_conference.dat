50|$|The <b>Pledging</b> <b>Conference</b> in Support of Iraq {{took place}} in Washington, D.C. on July 20, 2016 and was co-hosted by the United States, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, and Kuwait. The {{humanitarian}} <b>pledging</b> <b>conference</b> was announced by the United States Department of State on June 22, 2016 after a humanitarian crisis unfolded in Fallujah, Iraq due to the military operation to rid the city of Islamic State militants. Secretary of State, John Kerry, appealed the 26 country attendees for $2 billion US dollars to address four areas; immediate stabilization, expanding stabilization, dismantling of explosive devices, and humanitarian assistance.|$|E
50|$|On January 18, 2006 donor nations pledged {{two billion}} US dollars to combat bird flu at the two-day International <b>Pledging</b> <b>Conference</b> on Avian and Human Influenza held in China. Over ten billion dollars {{have been spent}} and over two hundred million birds have been killed to try to contain H5N1.|$|E
5000|$|Kuwait-Syria {{relations}} were severed following the Syrian Civil War. Relations were further strained since Kuwait closed its embassies {{along with the}} rest of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. Bilaterial relations have since come to focus on humanitarian efforts for Syria instead. For example, Kuwait has hosted three international <b>pledging</b> <b>conferences</b> in 2013, 2014 and 2015, raising 1.5bn, 2.4bn and 3.8bn respectively.|$|R
40|$|Representatives of {{national}} governments, international organisations, businesses and NGOs assembled on 4 February in London for the high-profile conference "Supporting Syria & the Region", jointly {{hosted by the}} United Kingdom, Germany, Norway, Kuwait and the United Nations. After three previous <b>pledging</b> <b>conferences</b> on the Syria crisis that barely scraped together the necessary funding to keep Syrian refugees in the neighbouring states alive, this year witnessed a change in tack. Not only were funding expectations largely met, but the conference also aimed to develop an entirely new formula for integrating refugees into the neighbouring states that host them. Besides improving access to education, this centred on ways to allow Syrians to access the labour market. Now that the dust has settled a little, {{it may be time}} to ask: what are the chances for these aspirations to actually materialise? This policy brief first looks at how the overall context of the <b>pledging</b> <b>conferences</b> has changed, and surveys the main promises and plans presented in the course of the conference. It then takes a critical look at the situation in Jordan - currently seen as the most promising candidate for sweeping policy change regarding its Syrian refugee population. It shows how the devil is in the details of governing Syrian labour and socio-economic development projects, and traces previous attempts for such changes. It argues that changing labour market regulations is not the silver bullet hoped for by the international community, but that real change can only come about if Europe rethinks its priorities vis-à-vis the Syrian crisis. The MPC is co-financed by the European University Institute and the European Unio...|$|R

50|$|At the Washington Donors Conference in October, 1995, India pledged US$1 {{million for}} {{assistance}} to the Palestinian people. At the subsequent <b>pledging</b> <b>conference</b> in Paris in January, 1996, India pledged another US$1 million which was utilised for construction of a Library-cum-Activity Centre at the Palestinian Technical College in Deir-El-Balah and another Library at the Al-Azhar University in Gaza. At yet another International Donors Conference in Washington DC on 30 November 1998, India pledged another US$1 million. The sum of US$300,000 was disbursed to Al-Azhar University {{for the construction of}} two additional floors to its library. The remaining amount was utilised for a Human Resource Development Programme.|$|E
50|$|Preventative {{costs are}} also high. Governments {{worldwide}} have spent billions of U.S. dollars preparing {{and planning for}} a potential H5N1 avian influenza pandemic, with costs associated with purchasing drugs and vaccines as well as developing disaster drills and strategies for improved border controls. On 1 November 2005, United States President George W. Bush unveiled the National Strategy to Safeguard Against the Danger of Pandemic Influenza backed by a request to Congress for $7.1 billion to begin implementing the plan. Internationally, on 18 January 2006, donor nations pledged US$2 billion to combat bird flu at the two-day International <b>Pledging</b> <b>Conference</b> on Avian and Human Influenza held in China.|$|E
50|$|The UAE has {{provided}} US$583 million {{in response to}} assisting the 1.5 million internally displaced people both in Syria and in host countries for refugees. The UAE has guaranteed US$460 million during all three International Humanitarian <b>Pledging</b> <b>Conferences</b> for Syria held in Kuwait. UAE aid delivered to Syria is through different {{organizations such as the}} UN, UNICEF, UNHCR, WFP and WHO. Humanitarian projects inside Syria cost US$67.8 million, while the largest project received US$15.6 million towards the Syria Recovery Trust that provides necessary supplies such as water, food, medical care and energy. Additionally, the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development provided food assistance to IDPs as well as Palestinian refugees in Syria. Another project funded was to support the nutrition of {{children under the age of}} five and nourishing pregnant women inside Syria.|$|R

25|$|In December 2002, the Cairo Anti-war <b>Conference</b> <b>pledged</b> to organise {{demonstrations in}} Egypt and the International Campaign Against Aggression on Iraq (which {{came out of}} the Cairo conference) sought to {{co-ordinate}} more demonstrations across the world. Around this time, the US anti-war group International ANSWER called for actions in North America supporting the proposed protests in Europe.|$|R
5|$|In April 2009, donors at a UN-sponsored <b>conference</b> <b>pledged</b> over $250 {{million to}} help improve security. The funds were {{earmarked}} for AMISOM and supporting Somalia's security, including the build-up of a security force of 6,000 members {{as well as an}} augmented police force of 10,000 men. In June 2009, the Somali military received 40 tonnes worth of arms and ammunition from the U.S. government to assist it in combating the insurgency.|$|R
5000|$|Adiseshiah was {{responsible}} {{for the development of the}} Karachi Plan for Universal Primary Education for Asia, the Addis Ababa and Santiago plans for the African and Latin American educational development and the corresponding science plans for Asia, Africa and Latin America. He worked in tandem with David Owen, Executive Chairman of the Technical Assistance Board to convince donor countries, since the financing of the expanded programme rested on voluntary contributions made by them at <b>pledging</b> <b>conferences.</b> He soon recognised the need for looking to additional sources and established relations with the International Development Association (IDA), Inter-American Development Bank and other regional development banks. UNESCO approached the World Bank, also known as International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) for medium trade credit for funding a project in Tunisia in 1962. The IBRD till then was concentrating on investments in physical capital. It needed the persuasive skills of Adiseshiah to shift IBRD’s focus exclusively from expansion of physical capital towards the development of human capital as well, especially extension of education. He was chiefly instrumental in negotiating the memorandum of understanding between International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and UNESCO in 1964. He introduced flexibility in utilizing multilateral aid. For instance, he used a substantial part of USSR contribution for technical assistance for establishing IIT, Mumbai. The expanded technical assistance programme was merged with the United Nations Special Fund to form the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) which was launched in 1966. He was able to formulate in each country a programme of technical and financial assistance, which he started with a global outlay of $3 million per annum in 1950. When he retired from the organization, the outlay had increased to $300 million! ...|$|R
5000|$|The Security Council reaffirmed its {{commitment}} to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence and unity of Afghanistan and welcomed the constitution adopted by the Loya Jirga on 4 January 2004. It also endorsed the agreement of the [...] "Kabul Declaration on Good Neighbourly Relations" [...] and stressed {{the central role of}} the United Nations in assisting the Afghan people in rebuilding their country. The legitimacy of the Afghan Transitional Administration and endorsement of the Bonn Agreement was reaffirmed, including a planned international <b>conference</b> <b>pledging</b> long-term commitment to Afghanistan.|$|R
5000|$|When The Daily Times in Blantyre, the {{commercial}} capital, wrote {{a story on}} Kamkwamba's wind turbine in November 2006, the story circulated through the blogosphere, and TED conference director Emeka Okafor invited Kamkwamba to talk at TEDGlobal 2007 in Arusha, Tanzania as a guest. His speech moved the audience, and several venture capitalists at the <b>conference</b> <b>pledged</b> to help finance his secondary education. His story was covered by Sarah Childress for The Wall Street Journal. He became a student at African Bible College Christian Academy in Lilongwe.

5000|$|Under Huie's leadership, the Texas Conference {{has also}} {{entered into a}} global {{partnership}} with Bishop Benjamin Boni and the Côte d'Ivoire Annual Conference in West Africa. Healthcare, education, and economic empowerment are the cornerstones of the partnership. The Texas <b>Conference</b> <b>pledged</b> to raise $1 million over two years {{for the purchase of}} long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets {{to stop the spread of}} malaria, which is the No. 1 killer in Africa. (A child dies every 30 seconds from the disease.) The conference raised $1 million in 1 year, and leveraged partnerships with Nothing But Nets, the Clinton Global Initiative, and others to deliver more than 800,000 life saving nets to the children of Côte d'Ivoire in November 2008. http://www.txcumc.org/news_detail.asp?pkvalue=351 ...|$|R
25|$|The United States and the Soviet Union {{put an end}} to the Sino-Japanese War (and World War II) {{by attacking}} the Japanese with a new weapon (on America's part) and an {{incursion}} into Manchuria (on the Soviet Union's part). On August 6, 1945, an American B-29 bomber, the Enola Gay, dropped the first atomic bomb used in combat on Hiroshima, killing tens of thousands and leveling the city. On August 9, 1945, the Soviet Union renounced its non-aggression pact with Japan and attacked the Japanese in Manchuria, fulfilling its Yalta <b>Conference</b> <b>pledge</b> to attack the Japanese within three months after the end of the war in Europe. The attack was made by three Soviet army groups. On that same day, a second equally destructive atomic bomb was dropped by the United States on Nagasaki.|$|R
5000|$|Over 6,000 {{college and}} {{university}} professors signed a national petition during the weekend of January 28 denouncing the executive order. A letter denouncing the immigration ban has by February 1, collected more than 18,000 signatures from academics. Leaders in {{a large number of}} colleges and universities issued statements against the immigration ban. Academics criticized the executive order because of the disruption in education it caused some students, because of the confusion in its implication and in [...] "many cases, expressed moral outrage." [...] The Association of American Universities has called for the immigration ban to end [...] "as quickly as possible." [...] Johns Hopkins University has asked students and faculty to avoid traveling outside of the United States. More than 4,500 International academics have <b>pledged</b> to boycott <b>conferences</b> based in the U.S.|$|R
2500|$|On 23 April 2009, {{international}} donors pledged over $250 {{million for}} Somalia, including $134 million {{to increase the}} African Union peacekeeping mission from 4,350 troops to 8,000 troops and $34 million for Somali security forces. Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon told delegates at a donors' conference sponsored by the UN that [...] "Piracy {{is a symptom of}} anarchy and insecurity on the ground", and that [...] "More security on the ground will make less piracy on the seas." [...] Somali President Sharif Ahmed <b>pledged</b> at the <b>conference</b> that he would fight piracy and to loud applause said that [...] "It is our duty to pursue these criminals not only on the high seas, but also on terra firma". The Somali government has not gone after pirates because pirate leaders currently have more power than the government. It has been estimated by piracy experts that in 2008 the pirates gained about $80 million through ransom payments.|$|R
5000|$|The Tehran Conference (codenamed Eureka) was a {{strategy}} meeting of Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill from 28 November to 1 December 1943, after the Anglo-Soviet Invasion of Iran. It {{was held in}} the Soviet Union's embassy in Tehran, Iran. It {{was the first of the}} World War II conferences of the [...] "Big Three" [...] Allied leaders (the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom). It closely followed the Cairo Conference which had taken place on 22-26 November 1943, and preceded the 1945 Yalta and Potsdam conferences. Although the three leaders arrived with differing objectives, the main outcome of the Tehran Conference was the Western Allies' commitment to open a second front against Nazi Germany. The conference also addressed the Allies' relations with Turkey and Iran, operations in Yugoslavia and against Japan, and the envisaged post-war settlement. A separate protocol signed at the <b>conference</b> <b>pledged</b> the Big Three to recognize Iran's independence.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the close}} of the Vienna conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons, and {{alongside}} the Chair's summary, the Austrian Government issued the Austrian Pledge in its national capacity, in which recalled the [...] "legal gap for the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons". Austria therefore [...] "pledges to cooperate with all relevant stakeholders, States, international organisations, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movements, parliamentarians and civil society, in efforts to stigmatise, prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons in light of their unacceptable humanitarian consequences and associated risks." [...] The Austrian Pledge was a major development in the run up to the 2015 Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which reviews the implementation of the treaty in a five-yearly cycle. Before the conference, 66 states had endorsed the <b>Pledge.</b> During the <b>conference,</b> the perceived intransigence of nuclear weapon states and uncertain prospects for a consensus outcome pushed a growing number of states to endorse the Pledge. Austria reacted by [...] "internationalising" [...] the Pledge, renaming it Humanitarian Pledge. By the end of the conference, 107 states had endorsed it, which was hailed by civil society as [...] "the real outcome" [...] of the NPT review. [...] The Humanitarian Pledge has been endorsed by 108 states as of 1 June 2015.|$|R
5000|$|The {{movement}} to form Women in Nigeria evolved {{out of a}} study group of university sociology and political science lecturers at ABU. The study focused {{on the life of}} women in Nigeria. As the ideas from other scholars and lecturers from various universities were added, the group began to grow. In 1982, the First Annual Women in Nigeria Conference was held in Zaria. It included presentations by Ayesha Iman, Bene Madunagu, Bilkisu Yusuf, Renee Pittin, Molara Ogundipe-Leslie and Therese Nweke. WIN was formally launched thereafter, with attendees of the initial <b>conference</b> <b>pledging</b> to lend support. The primary mission of WIN is to bring awareness and change regarding the widespread oppression and exploitation of women in Nigeria. Many of the participants of the first conference became WIN members. WIN seeks equality for {{men and women who are}} oppressed in Nigeria, but that women are particularly exploited. WIN linked oppression of women to the overall oppression witnessed by citizens of the society especially the poor and in the process introduced class and gender dynamics in the struggle for women’s emancipation. [...] Though, it is a women's right organization, WIN also fights for social and economic justice. At inception, male members constituted 30% of members but over the years, the active participation of male members declined.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the coal}} mines in Britain were {{purchased}} {{by the government in}} 1947 and put {{under the control of the}} National Coal Board, with only the smaller mines left in private ownership. The NUM had campaigned for nationalisation for decades and, once it was achieved, sought to work with the NCB in managing the industry and discouraged strikes. Under the chairmanship of Alf Robens, pit closures became widespread as coal's place in energy generation declined. The NUM leadership continued to resist calls for strike action, but an unofficial strike began in 1969 after a <b>conference</b> <b>pledge</b> on the hours of surface-workers was not acted upon. This was a watershed moment that led to increased spending on the coal industry and a much slower rate of pit closures, as well as the election of more militant officials to the NUM leadership. Under the government of Ted Heath, an official strike in 1972 won increased wages after the Wilberforce Commission. Less than two years later, Heath called a general election over another official strike, called after an overtime ban had led to a Three Day Week in Britain, and lost the election to the Labour Party. The wage demands were then met and spending on the industry continued to increase, including the establishment of the new Selby Coalfield.|$|R
