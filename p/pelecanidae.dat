5|$|Pelicans are a genus {{of large}} water birds {{that makes up}} the family <b>Pelecanidae.</b> They are characterised by a long beak and a large throat pouch used for {{catching}} prey and draining water from the scooped up contents before swallowing. They have predominantly pale plumage, the exceptions being the brown and Peruvian pelicans. The bills, pouches and bare facial skin of all species become brightly coloured before the breeding season. The eight living pelican species have a patchy global distribution, ranging latitudinally from the tropics to the temperate zone, though they are absent from interior South America {{as well as from}} polar regions and the open ocean.|$|E

50|$|The {{cormorant}} family Phalacrocoracidae {{has traditionally}} been included - like all other birds with fully webbed toes - in the Pelecaniformes. But the namesake pelicans (<b>Pelecanidae)</b> are actually closer relatives of storks (Ciconiidae) than of cormorants. Hence, it has been proposed to separate the Phalacrocoracidae and relatives as order Phalacrocoraciformes.|$|E
5000|$|Liptornis hesternus is {{a fossil}} bird of {{uncertain}} affinities. It {{was described by}} Argentine palaeontologist Florentino Ameghino in 1894 from a large cervical vertebra from the Middle Miocene of Patagonia. At {{the time it was}} referred to the <b>Pelecanidae,</b> though this is questionable. In his 1933 palaeornithological review, Lambrecht referred it only to the superfamily Sulides without placing it in a family. A later study has suggested family Anhingidae.|$|E
50|$|The Australian pelican (Pelecanus conspicillatus) {{is a large}} waterbird of {{the family}} <b>Pelecanidae,</b> {{widespread}} on the inland and coastal waters of Australia and New Guinea, also in Fiji, parts of Indonesia and as a vagrant in New Zealand. It is a predominantly white bird with black wings and a pink bill. It has been recorded as having the longest bill of any living bird. It mainly eats fish, but will also consume birds and scavenges for scraps.|$|E
50|$|Of the {{families}} in Pelecaniformes, only <b>Pelecanidae,</b> Balaenicipitidae, and Scopidae remain. The tropicbird family Phaethontidae has since been moved to their own order Phaethontiformes. Genetic analysis seems {{to show that the}} Pelecaniformes is actually closely related to the Ardeidae and Threskiornithidae. As for the Suliformes, they are distantly related to the current Pelecaniformes. According to Hackett et al. (2008), loons, penguins, storks, and as well as Suliformes and Pelecaniformes, all seem to have evolved from a common ancestor. The proposed waterbird superorder has been suggested.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the many}} species {{affected}} by oil toxicity, birds {{are usually the}} most severely affected. Birds that nest near the shoreline {{are most likely to}} be affected, including loons (Gavia spp.), grebes (Family: Podicipedidae), murres (Uria spp.), pelicans (Family: <b>Pelecanidae),</b> and penguins (Family: Spheniscidae). The species of bird and the type of oil can vary the effects of oil exposure. Birds affected by oil toxicity often die from hypothermia, starvation, exhaustion, or drowning. Birds exposed to oil become more susceptible to other diseases due to a reduced immunologic function.|$|E

50|$|The family <b>Pelecanidae</b> was {{introduced}} (as Pelicanea) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815.Pelicans give their {{name to the}} Pelecaniformes, an order which has a varied taxonomic history. Tropicbirds, darters, cormorants, gannets, boobies and frigatebirds, all traditional members of the order, have since been reclassified: tropicbirds into their own order, Phaethontiformes, and the remainder into Suliformes. In their place, herons, ibises, spoonbills, the hamerkop and the shoebill have now been transferred into Pelecaniformes. Molecular {{evidence suggests that the}} shoebill and the hamerkop form a sister group to the pelicans, though there is some doubt as to the exact relationships among the three lineages.|$|E

5000|$|The holotype femur's {{classification}} {{mirrors the}} recently renewed uncertainties about the pseudotooth birds' placement. At {{the time of}} its description, when it was still much surrounded by matrix, it was believed to be from a giant goose or swan. This is referred to in the genus name, which means [...] "ancient goose-like bird". But only one year later, the bone had been prepared from the matrix and was submitted to an improvised phenetic analysis of its details. It was compared to that of Anserinae and Dendrocygninae (other Anseriformes were either similar to these or too unlike P. mioceanus), as well as with <b>Pelecanidae,</b> Phaethontidae and Phalacrocoraciformes of the [...] "higher waterbird" [...] radiation, and found to resemble the former in one, the latter in 4 out of 5 traits. Some minor details of the femur were also unlike in the Anseriformes. The study proposed the fossil bird to have been [...] "a large steganopod ... somewhat larger than Pelecanus erythrorhynchos or P. onocrotalus," [...] and not securely assignable to a known family. But as cladistic analysis had not yet been developed, it was of course not studied whether the similarities between P. mioceanus and the [...] "higher waterbirds" [...] are apomorphies. It has been noted, however, that adaptation to oceanic habits, has induced in pseudotooth bird legs and feet features convergent to other seabirds. Still, the fossil is a rather good specimen, considering how little humerus material known from pseudotooth birds; a recent cladistic analysis (which did not include P. mioceanus) did not put much emphasis on humerus traits, for example, as so few good fossils are known.|$|E

40|$|Metazoan symbionts, {{including}} parasites, infecting the American {{white pelican}} (AWP) Pelecanus erythrorhynchos comprise {{a list of}} 75 species, 7 of which are new host records. Several new geographic records are also presented, but generally these have a low value because of the migratory nature of the bird. Evidence suggests that some parasites, mostly flies and other arthropods but also nematodes and digeneans, produce detrimental behavioral or pathologic changes in the AWP. Some of the arthropods transmit microbial agents to the pelican. Two digeneans that have the AWP as a definitive host harm and even kill their catfish intermediate host, especially in aquaculture, and another causes abnormalities and mortality in amphibians. Some of the arthropods with low hostspecificity can potentially transmit harmful microbial agents to humans and domestic animals. A few avian bloodflukes, intestinal flukes, and nematodes can potentially cause “swimmers itch,” gastroenteritis, and “anisakiasis,” respectively, in humans. Because of the life cycles of some helminths, presence of those worms can provide an indication as to the dietary items of a specific pelican individual, where the individual has been, {{and how long it}} has been present in an area.

Among the former are: (1) during ontogenetic development, they change the proportions between the rostrum and thebraincase, stretching the first and reducing the height of the second. (2) The skulls have a nasal opening in their early stages of development, which is completely closed with the growth of the bird. The respiratory function moves to a space that is below the pre-orbital fenestra and the jugal, which is protected by ranfoteca. (3) Adult individuals present a trabecular space in the inner part of the upper jaw and frontals that confers resistance to the skull.

40|$|In 2006 - 2007, stable flies, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.) (Diptera: Muscidae), were {{suspected}} of being enzootic vectors of West Nile virus (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, WNV) during a die-off of American white pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos Gmelin) (<b>Pelecanidae)</b> in Montana, USA. WNV-positive stable flies were observed feeding en masse on incapacitated, WNV-positive pelicans, arousing suspicions that the flies could {{have been involved in}} WNV transmission among pelicans, and perhaps to livestock and humans. We assessed biological transmission by infecting stable flies intrathoracically with WNV and testing them at 2 -d intervals over 20 d. Infectious WNV was detected in fly bodies in decreasing amounts over time for only the first 6 d post infection, an indication that WNV did not replicate within fly tissues and that stable flies cannot biologically transmit WNV. We assessed mechanical transmission using a novel technique. Specifically, we fed WNV-infected blood to individual flies by using a cotton swab (i. e., artificial donor), and at intervals of 1 min- 24 h, we allowed flies to refeed on a different swab saturated with WNV-negative blood (i. e., artificial recipient). Flies mechanically transmitted viable WNV from donor to recipient swabs for up to 6 h post infection, with the majority of the transmission events occurring within the first hour. Flies mechanically transmitted WNV RNA to recipient swabs for up to 24 h, mostly within the first 6 h. Given its predilection to feed multiple times when disturbed, these findings support the possibility that the stable fly could mechanically transmit WNV...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} new fossil {{specimen}} of a pelican from the Tatrot Formation of the Siwalik Hills, India. It likely represents Pelecanus sivalensis Davies, 1880, the smaller {{of the two}} previously published species from the Siwalik Group stratigraphic sequence. This complete tarsometatarsus is the first fossil bone of a pelican collected in India for over 100 years. It is from the latest Pliocene (∼ 2. 6 Ma), and is the youngest pelican fossil from the region. The new specimen exhibits a derived distoplantar 'slant' to the plantar margin of the medial crest of the hypotarsus, and a combination of features related to the morphology of the hypotarsus, the distal foramen, trochleae, and overall size that allow further differentiation from known tarsometatarsi of fossil and extant pelicans, including the three species of extant pelicans that occur in India (Pelecanus crispus, P. onocrotalus, and P. philippensis). It is of appropriate size for Pelecanus sivalensis, which to date has been known only by fragments of other skeletal elements of the wing, leg, and shoulder girdle. Thus, the observation that this tarsometatarsus is morphologically distinct from those of known pelicans provides further support for the distinctiveness {{of at least one}} extinct species of pelican from the Siwalik Group sediments. While the morphology of the tarsometatarsus allows for separation from other taxa known from tarsometatarsi, we found no clear shared derived states to place this taxon with any confidence in a phylogenetic context relative to any other pelican species, or even determine if {{it is part of the}} crown group of <b>Pelecanidae.</b> However, published molecular data are consistent with an origin of the crown clade prior to the Pleistocene, suggesting (along with one morphological character) the possibility that this species belongs to the Old World clade of pelican species...|$|E
