It is assumed that the pollutants enter into the environment not directly by the population but by a precursor produced by the population itself. It is further assumed that larger the population, faster the precursor is produced, and larger the precursor, faster the pollutant is produced. Criteria for nonlinear stability and instability for both spatial and non-spatial models are obtained. The various parameter ranges for stable homogeneous solutions are identified. By the simulation experiments, {{it is observed that}} by applying an appropriate effort F, the population density P can be maintained at a higher equilibrium level.

40|$|Ozone {{near the}} surface is harmful to human health and {{is a result of}} the {{photochemical}} reaction with both man-made and natural <b>precursor</b> <b>pollutant</b> sources. Therefore, in order to reduce near surface ozone concentrations, communities must reduce anthropogenic pollution sources. However, the injection of stratospheric ozone into the troposphere, known as a stratospheric intrusion, can also lead to concentrations of ground-level ozone exceeding air quality standards. Stratospheric intrusions are dynamical atmospheric features, however, these intrusions have been misrepresented in models and reanalyses until recently, as the features of a stratospheric intrusion are best identified in horizontal resolutions of approximately 50 km or smaller. NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version- 2 (MERRA- 2) reanalysis is a publicly-available high-resolution dataset (~ 50 km) with assimilated ozone that characterizes stratospheric ozone on the same spatiotemporal resolution as the meteorology. We show that stratospheric intrusions that impact surface air quality are well represented in the MERRA- 2 reanalysis. This is demonstrated through a case study analysis of stratospheric intrusion events which were identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to impact surface ozone air quality in spring 2012 in Colorado. The stratospheric intrusions are identified in MERRA- 2 by the folding of the dynamical tropopause under the jet stream and subsequent isentropic descent of dry, O 3 -rich stratospheric air towards the surface where ozone air quality exceedences were observed. The MERRA- 2 reanalysis can support air quality agencies for more rapid identification of the impact of stratospheric air on ground-level ozone...|$|E
40|$|Secondary {{pollutant}} impacts from {{emissions of}} single sources {{may need to}} be assessed to satisfy a variety of regulatory requirements including the Clean Air Act New Source Review and Prevention of Significant Deterioration programs and the National Environmental Policy Act. In this work, single source impacts on O 3 and secondary PM 2. 5 are estimated with annual 2011 photochemical grid model simulations where new hypothetical sources are added to the central and eastern United States with varying precursor emission rates and emission release heights. Impacts from these hypothetical sources are tracked with photochemical grid model source apportionment. Single source impacts on downwind 8 -hr maximum O 3 tend to increase as emissions of NOX or VOC increase. Downwind impacts on PM 2. 5 sulfate and nitrate also tend to increase as emissions of SO 2 and NOX increase. For all secondary pollutants, impacts from these hypothetical sources tend to decrease as distance from the source increases. However, peak impacts on O 3 and secondary PM 2. 5 are not at the facility fence-line but typically within 50 - 100 km depending on the emissions rate, <b>precursor</b> <b>pollutant,</b> and emissions release point. Downwind impacts are not uniform directionally from these sources due to varying downwind availability of chemical reactants and prevailing meteorology. Peak impacts for O 3 (~ 15 ppb) and PM 2. 5 sulfate (~ 8 mg/m 3) were within 50 km of these hypothetical sources and peak impacts for PM 2. 5 nitrate (~ 1 mg/m 3) were within 125 km. The daily maximum 8 -hr O 3 and maximum daily average PM 2. 5 sulfate and nitrate ion impacts for the new hypothetical sources modeled here are generally consistent with those reported in literature. Additional assessments of single source impacts on secondary pollutants are still needed to provide a more comprehensive assessment of different source types and source environments...|$|E

The inventory is established for the reference year 2000 and it has 10 km spatial resolution. Annual anthropogenic emission data obtained from official national emission inventories and from international emission databases were spatially disaggregated and allocated to a gridded domain using the top-down methodology. Source specific temporal profiles were used in order monthly and hourly emission data to be estimated. In the study area, the highest NOx amounts are emitted by the maritime and road transport sectors. Road transport has a prominent role in anthropogenic NMVOCs emissions followed by the solvent and other product use sector. The main CO emission sources are represented by the road transport sector and the non-industrial combustion plants. In the present study, the contribution of the transport sector to the total emissions of pollutants over urban and non-urban areas of Greece is investigated. Over almost all Greek urban areas, road transport is the major NMVOCs and CO emission source. Road transport contribution to NOx emissions is greater than 50 % at the large urban centres of Greece.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a synthesis of}} results that have emerged from recent modeling studies of the potential sensitivity of U.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assessment effort to increase scientific understanding of the multiple complex interactions among climate, emissions, atmospheric chemistry, and air quality. The ultimate goal is to enhance the ability of air quality managers to consider global change in their decisions through improved characterization of the potential effects of global change on air quality, including O 3. The results discussed here are interim, representing {{the first phase of the}} EPA assessment. The aim in this first phase was to consider the effects of climate change alone on air quality, without accompanying changes in anthropogenic emissions of <b>precursor</b> <b>pollutants.</b> Across all of the modeling experiments carried out by the different groups, simulated global climate change causes increases of a few to several parts per billion (ppb) in summertime mean maximum daily 8 -h average O 3 concentrations over substantial regions of the country. The different modeling experiments in general do not, however, simulate the same regional patterns of change. These differences seem to result largely from variations in the simulated patterns of changes in key meteorological drivers, such as temperature and surface insolation. How isoprene nitrate chemistry is represented in the different modeling systems is an additional critical factor in the simulated O 3 response to climate change...|$|R
40|$|The {{creation}} of emission data for a photochemical quality-forecasting model requires the efficient and accurate estimation of {{temporal and spatial}} variations of emission sources of ozone precursors. To achieve this goal, the existing emission inventory preparation and processing systems need to be streamlined and modified. The critical emission <b>precursor</b> <b>pollutants</b> for ozone are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitric oxides (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO). The spatial variability and temporal behavior of these compounds are influenced both by meteorological conditions and by anthropogenic activities. The key complexities in the simulation of the temporal and spatial variations of these compounds are the biogenic sources, the on-road mobile sources, and major fossil-fuel point sources. The processing of the emission for biogenic sources can be streamlined by linking the preparation of meteorological output fields for the air quality chemistry model with the calculation of biogenic emission. The processing of temperature-dependent emission for mobile sources can be streamlined by using the MOBILE 5 B (or MOBILE 6) model to create simple temperature regressions to apply to normalized emission data prior to the actual forecast. The temperature/emission relationship can then {{be used in a}} very efficient calculation for the actual emission calculation. Finally, the processing of point source emission from major power plants can be streamlined by using historical CEM (Continuous Emission Monitoring) data to create temperature/emission relationships {{that can be used to}} estimate current power plant emission in an air quality forecast model.

40|$|AbstractWRF/Chem, a fully coupled meteorology–chemistry model, {{was used}} for the {{simulation}} of surface ozone pollution over the Central Gulf Coast region in Southeast United States of America (USA). Two ozone episodes during June 8 – 11, 2006 and July 18 – 22, 2006 characterized with hourly mixing ratios of 60 – 100 ppbv, were selected for the study. Suite of sensitivity experiments were conducted with three different planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes and three land surface models (LSM). The results indicate that Yonsei–University (YSU) PBL scheme in combination with NOAH and SOIL LSMs produce better simulations of both the meteorological and chemical species than others. YSU PBL scheme in combination with NOAH LSM had slightly better simulation than with SOIL scheme. Spatial comparison with observations showed that YSUNOAH experiment well simulated the diurnal mean ozone mixing ratio, timing of diurnal cycle as well as range in ozone mixing ratio at most monitoring stations with an overall correlation of 0. 726, bias of – 1. 55 ppbv, mean absolute error of 8. 11 ppbv and root mean square error of 14. 5 ppbv; and with an underestimation of 7 ppbv in the daytime peak ozone and about 8 % in the daily average ozone. Model produced 1 –hr, and 8 –hr average ozone values were well correlated with corresponding observed means. The minor underestimation of daytime ozone is attributed to the slight underestimation of air temperature which tend to slow–down the ozone production and overestimation of wind speeds which transport the produced ozone at a faster rate. Simulated mean horizontal and vertical flow patterns suggest the role of the horizontal transport and the PBL diffusion in the development of high ozone during the episode. Overall, the model is found to perform reasonably well to simulate the ozone and other <b>precursor</b> <b>pollutants</b> with good correlations and low error metrics.

The degradation of air quality {{is a very serious}} environmental problem that affects urban and industrial areas worldwide. Air pollution injures human health and ecosystems, diminishes crop yield, and spoils patrimony and materials. The phenomena involved in air pollution are very complex. Once emitted into the atmosphere, (primary) pollutants are transported, dispersed, transformed by gas/solid phase change and chemical reaction, and finally removed by dry and wet deposition. Most challenging {{is the fact that the}} health and environmental impacts of secondary pollutants (formed in the atmosphere) are frequently more severe than those of their <b>precursors</b> (primary <b>pollutants).</b> This is the case of ozone and other photochemical pollutants, such as peroxyacetil nitrate (PAN) and secondary particles, produced in the atmosphere by the photo-oxidation volatile organic compounds (VOC) catalyzed by nitrogen oxides (NO(sub x)).

Although stringent air quality regulations are in place, policy makers need efficient tools to test a wide range of control strategies. Sensitivity analysis provides predictions on how the interdependent concentrations of various PM 2. 5 components and also gaseous pollutant species will respond to specific combinations of precursor emission reductions. The Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) was outfitted with the Decoupled Direct Method in 3 D for calculating sensitivities of {{particulate matter}} (DDM- 3 D/PM). This method was evaluated and applied to high PM 2. 5 episodes in the Southeast United States. Sensitivities of directly emitted particles as well as those formed in the atmosphere through chemical and physical processing of emissions of gaseous precursors such as SO 2, NOx, VOCs, and NH 3 were calculated. DDM- 3 D/PM was further extended to calculate receptor oriented sensitivities or the Area of Influence (AOI). AOI analysis determines the geographical extent of relative air <b>pollutant</b> <b>precursor</b> contributions to <b>pollutant</b> levels at a specific receptor of interest.

40|$|Transportation {{conformity}} is {{the process}} by which Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) or Departments of Transportation demonstrate that transportation projects included in a region's Long-Range Plan (Plan) or Transportation Improvement Programs (TIP) do not cause new air quality violations, worsen existing violations, or delay timely attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Transportation conformity is a requirement of the Clean Air Act (CAA) in areas that do not meet the NAAQS or have previously been in violation of the NAAQS. Areas currently not meeting the NAAQS are known as nonattainment areas and areas that previously have not attained the NAAQS are known as maintenance areas. A transportation conformity demonstration shows that the region's TIPs and Plan are following or "conforming to" the State Implementation Plan (SIP) to meet the NAAQS. In nonattainment areas that do not have federally approved SIPs, the current conformity guidance, known as the Final Rule, issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) establishes guidelines for conducting transportation conformity demonstrations. The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) region is in nonattainment for two of the NAAQS (ozone and PM 2. 5). Portions of the region are maintenance areas for a third NAAQS (carbon monoxide or CO). Since ozone is not directly emitted, but is formed by the combination of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the presence of sunlight, conformity is demonstrated by analysis of the component pollutants. PM 2. 5 is directly emitted and <b>precursor</b> <b>pollutants</b> [...] in this case NOx [...] are also analyzed to demonstrate transportation conformity.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of agricultural emissions of primary (direct) and secondary (<b>precursor)</b> <b>pollutants</b> to air quality is rapidly being {{recognized as an}} important fraction of local and regional air pollution budgets. However, a significant uncertainty still exists in the magnitude and rate {{of these types of}} emissions, especially under “in field” conditions common within the central and western United States. Described herein are the results of a study conducted at a deep-pit swine production facility in central Iowa. The facility consisted of three separate, parallel barns, each housing around 1, 250 pigs with an average weight of approximately 90 pounds per animal. The area around the facility was topographically flat and surrounded by soybean and cornfields. A number of portable PM 10 /PM 2. 5 (AirMetrics MiniVol) samplers and passive NH 3 (Ogawa Model 3300) samplers were arrayed vertically and horizontally around the three-barn production facility, and data were collected on a daily-averaged basis for approximately three weeks in August and September of 2005. Additionally, a monitoring station was established approximately 40 m {{to the north of the}} nearest barn to record the typical suite of meteorological parameters (wind speed, direction, temperature, etc.) for determination of near-source atmospheric advection and dispersion. The AirMetrics samplers were operated with PM 2. 5 impactor separation heads for approximately the first half of the field study and were then switched to the PM 10 heads for the remaining portion of the study. Each AirMetrics sampler was fitted with a conditioned, preweighed Teflon filter and operated at approximately five liters per minute for a time-controlled 23 -hour period. Following sampling, the filters were recovered, conditioned, and reweighed at USU’s Utah Water Research Laboratory (UWRL) in Logan, UT for filter catch and ultimate determination of each location’s PM 2. 5 /PM 10 mass concentration. The Ogawa passive samplers were co-located and operated for the same time periods with the pre-treated (acid-coated) collection pads recovered after the same 23 -hr period and stored appropriately until the final analysis for NH 3 concentrations could be performed via ion chromatography at the UWRL facility. Emission estimates were derived via the comparisons of the measured particulate and NH 3 concentrations at each sampling location with the concentrations for each receptor (sample) point found via application of the EPA-recommended ISCST 3 air dispersion model (Lakes Environmental Software). The comparison of the measured and model predicted NH 3 concentrations resulted in a derived NH 3 emission rate of 17. 22 ± 7. 2 g/pig/day. This value is slightly more than two times greater than referenced emission rates; however, the two emission rates are within statistical uncertainty of each other.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} emissions control {{strategies to}} reduce ozone <b>precursor</b> <b>pollutants</b> are analyzed by applying a photochemical modeling system. Simulations of air quality conditions during an ozone episode which occurred in June, 2006 are undertaken by increasing or reducing area source emissions in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico. ^ Two air pollutants are primary drivers {{in the formation}} of tropospheric ozone. Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) undergo multiple chemical reactions under favorable meteorological conditions to form ozone, which is a secondary pollutant that irritates respiratory systems in sensitive individuals especially the elderly and young children. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to limit ambient air pollutants such as ozone by establishing an 8 -hour average concentration of 0. 075 ppm as the threshold at which a violation of the standard occurs. ^ Ozone forms primarily due reactions in the troposphere of NOx and VOC emissions generated primarily by anthropogenic sources in urban regions. Data from emissions inventories indicate area sources account for ∼ 15 of NOx and ∼ 45 % of regional VOC emissions. Area sources include gasoline stations, automotive paint bodyshops and nonroad mobile sources. Multiplicity of air pollution emissions sources provides an opportunity to investigate and potentially implement air quality improvement strategies to reduce emissions which contribute to elevated ozone concentrations. ^ A baseline modeling scenario was established using the CAMx photochemical air quality model from which a series of sensitivity analyses for evaluating air quality control strategies were conducted. Modifications to area source emissions were made by varying NOx and / or VOC emissions in the areas of particular interest. Model performance was assessed for each sensitivity analysis. Normalized bias (NB) and normalized error (NE) were used to identify variability of the PREDICTED to OBSERVED ozone concentrations of both BASELINE model and simulations with modified emissions assessed by the sensitivity analysis. All simulations were found to vary within acceptable ranges of these two criteria variables. ^ Simulation results indicate ozone formation in the PdN region is VOC-limited. Under VOC-limited conditions, modifications to NOx emissions do not produce a marked increase or decrease in ozone concentrations. Modifications to VOC emissions generated the highest variability in ozone concentrations. Increasing VOC emissions by 75 % produced results which minimized model bias and error when comparing PREDICTED and OBSERVED ozone concentrations. Increasing VOC emissions by 75 % either alone or in combination with a 75 % increase in NOx emissions generated PREDICTED ozone concentrations very near to OBSERVED ozone. ^ By evaluating the changes in ambient ozone concentrations through photochemical modeling, air quality planners may identify the most efficient or effective VOC emissions control strategies for area sources. Among the strategies to achieve emissions reductions are installation of gasoline vapor recovery systems, replacing high-pressure low-volume surface coating paint spray guns with high-volume low-pressure spray paint guns, requiring emissions control booths for surface coating operations as well as undertaking solvent management practices, requiring the sale of low VOC paint solvents in the surface-coating industry, and requiring low-VOC solvents in the dry cleaning industry. Other strategies to reduce VOC emissions include initiating Eco-Driving strategies to reduce fuel consumption from mobile sources and minimize vehicle idling at the international ports of entry by reducing bridge wait times. ^ This dissertation depicts a tool for evaluating impacts of emissions on regional air quality by addressing the highly unresolved fugitive emissions in the Paso del Norte region. It provides a protocol for decision makers to assess the effects of various emission control strategies in the region. Impacts of specific source categories such as the international ports of entry, gasoline stations, paint body shops, truck stops, and military installations on the regional air quality can be easily and systematically addressed in a timely manner in the future. ...|$|R
40|$|Greenhouse gas and air <b>pollutant</b> <b>precursor</b> {{emissions}} {{have been}} increasing rapidly in India. Large uncertainties exist in emissions inventories and quantification of their uncertainties {{is essential for}} {{better understanding of the}} linkages among emissions and air quality, climate, and health. We use Monte Carlo methods to assess the uncertainties of the existing carbon dioxide (CO 2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) emission estimates from four source sectors for India. We also assess differences in the existing emissions estimates within the nine subnational regions. We find large uncertainties, higher than the current estimates for all species other than CO, when all the existing emissions estimates are combined. We further assess the impact of these differences in emissions on air quality using a chemical transport model. More efforts are needed to constrain emissions, especially in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, where not only the emissions differences are high but also the simulated concentrations using different inventories. Our study highlights the importance of constraining SO 2, NOx, and NH 3 emissions for secondary PM concentrations. JRC. C. 5 -Air and Climat...|$|R
40|$|Biogenic {{volatile}} organic compounds (BVOCs) in household cleaning products play key roles in indoor air quality (IAQ) because they are <b>precursors</b> for secondary <b>pollutants</b> formation. An accurate and rapid analytical technique for their measurement is of importance. This paper describes an optimization of a method for solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the determination of BVOCs. SPME fibers coated with Carboxen-PDMS are used to collect 12 individual BVOCs under standard conditions with a short exposure time of 5 min. Parameters influencing the extraction processes including sampling time, temperature and relative humidity are also investigated. All of the targeted BVOCs are shown to have limits of detection (LODs) in mixing ratios ranging from 0. 31 - 0. 50 ppbv, which are two magnitudes better than the LODs reported. The method precisions are between 1. 1 % and 6. 7 %. Comparison {{studies were carried out}} on a set of four floor cleaner extracts using the SPME method and traditional liquid injection method. Good agreement of the targeted BVOCs by the two methods was demonstrated. Our results indicated that SPME can serve as a simple and rapid sample collection approach to quantify BVOCs accurately and precisely in the indoor environment.

40|$|For {{secondary}} air <b>pollutants,</b> <b>precursor</b> emissions may impact concentrations in nonlinear and interdependent manners. We explore the nonlinear responses {{of one such}} pollutant, ozone, to emissions of its precursors, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds. Modeling is conducted for a high ozone episode in the southeastern United States, applying a second-order direct sensitivity method in a regional air quality model. As applied here, the sensitivity method neglects most aerosol and aqueous chemistry processes. Inclusion of second-order sensitivities is shown to enable accurate characterization of response to large perturbations in emissions. An index is introduced to characterize the nonlinearity of ozone response to NO_x emitted from each source region. Nonlinearity is found to increase with the tonnage and emission density of the source region. Interactions among the impacts of emission sources are shown to lead to discrepancies between source contribution attributed to an ensemble of emitters and {{the sum of the}} contributions attributed to each component. A method is introduced for applying these “cross-sensitivity” interactions to assess the uncertainty of sensitivity and source apportionment estimates arising from uncertainty in an emissions inventory. For ozone response to NO_x, underestimates in emission rates lead to underprediction of total source contribution but overprediction of per-ton sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{mechanisms}} describing ignition, {{flame propagation}} and pollutant formation typically involve several hundred species and elementary reactions, prohibiting {{their use in}} practical three-dimensional engine simulations. Conventionally reduced mechanisms often fail to predict minor radicals and <b>pollutant</b> <b>precursors.</b> The ILDM-method is an automatic reduction of a detailed mechanism, which assumes local equilibrium {{with respect to the}} fastest time scales identified by a local eigenvector analysis. In the reactive flow calculation, the species compositions are constrained to these manifolds. Conservation equations are solved for {{only a small number of}} reaction progress variables, thereby retaining the accuracy of detailed chemical mechanisms. This gives an effective way of coupling the details of complex chemistry with the time variations due to turbulence. A standard and RNG k-e model is used to model the turbulent flow field. Turbulence-chemistry interactions are taken into account by integrating the chemical source terms over a presumed probability density function (pdf). The standard KIVA III code along with the above models for chemistry and turbulence were used to simulate the flow in a single cylinder of a DI diesel engine. Since no equilibrium or partial-equilibrium approach is involved, accurate concentrations of O radicals and soot-precursors (C 2 H 2 & C 3 H 3) can be obtained from the ILDM...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{determine}} the levels and variations of carbonaceous aerosol in Hong Kong, PM 2. 5 and PM 10 {{samples were collected}} by high volume (Hi-vol) samplers at three monitoring stations (representing middle-scale roadside, urban-, and regional-scale environments) during winter (November 2000 to February 2001) and summer (June 2001 to August 2001) periods. The highest concentrations of organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) were found at the middle-scale roadside site with the lowest at the regional-scale site. The percentages of WSOC in total carbon at these sites were inversely correlated with their concentrations (i. e., the highest percentages of WSOC were observed at the regional-scale site). A high WSOC fraction {{may be associated with}} aged aerosol because of the secondary formation by photochemical oxidation of organic <b>precursors</b> of anthropogenic <b>pollutants</b> during transport. The annual average of isotope abundances (? 13 C) of OC and EC were ? 26. 9 ± 0. 5 ? and ? 25. 6 ± 0. 1 ?, respectively. There were no notable differences for seasonal distributions of carbon isotopic composition, consistent with motor vehicle emissions being the main source contributors of carbonaceous aerosol in Hong Kong. OC 13 C abundances at the regional-scale site were higher than those at the middle-scale roadside and urban sites, consistent with secondary organic aerosols of biogenic origin...|$|R

During {{the second half of}} the 20 th century, the United States implemented regulations and controls to reduce the levels of criteria air pollutants and achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for the protection of human health, while concurrently reducing the levels of toxic air pollutants. Objective: In this commentary we trace the changes in air pollution in New Jersey as a case study, demonstrating the impact of local, state, and federal strategies to control emissions of <b>pollutants</b> and <b>pollutant</b> <b>precursors</b> from the 1950 s until today. Discussion: The original NAAQS (1970 – 1995) have been achieved, and significant progress has been made to achieve revised standards for ozone and particulate matter (PM) < 2. 5 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM 2. 5) in New Jersey, which in the past was considered a highly polluted industrial state. Co n c l u s i o n s: Assuming no reversals on current regulations because of some major event or energy infrastructure disruption, outdoor air pollution reductions will continue to address health risks among specific segments of the general population affected by ozone/PM and pollution caused by neighborhood, local, and regional point and mobile sources.

40|$|In {{response}} to growing environmental concerns {{reflected in the}} 1990 Clean Air Act Amendment (CAAA), the United States Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored several research and development projects in late 1995 {{as part of an}} initiative entitled Advanced Environmental Control Technologies for Coal-Based Power Systems. The program provided cost-shared support for research and development projects that could accelerate the commercialization of affordable, high-efficiency, low-emission, coal-fueled electric generating technologies. Clean coal technologies developed under this program would serve as prototypes for later generations of technologies to be implemented in the industrial sector. In order to identify technologies with the greatest potential for commercial implementation, projects funded under Phase I of this program were subject to competitive review by DOE before being considered for continuation funding under Phase II. One of the primary topical areas identified under the DOE initiative relates to the development of improved technologies for reducing the emissions of air toxics. Previous studies have suggested that many of the potentially hazardous air <b>pollutant</b> <b>precursors</b> (HAPPs) occur as trace elements in the mineral matter of run-of-mine coals. As a result, these elements have the potential to be removed prior to combustion at the mine site by physical coal cleaning processes (i. e., coal preparation). Unfortunately, existing coal preparation plants are generally limited in their ability to remove HAPPs due to incomplete liberation of the mineral matter and high organic associations of some trace elements. In addition, existing physical coal cleaning plants are not specifically designed or optimized to ensure that high trace element rejections may be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Important {{advantages}} {{in the use}} of alternative and renewable fuels (CO 2 reduction in the atmosphere, recovery of energy from wastes, limited SO,, NO, and heavy metal emissions) can be obtained only by solving technological and economical problems that make direct combustion of such fuels impractical. This is possible after a detailed investigation to determine the most important features of these materials in all steps of the thermal process. At present, few data can actually be found for the char properties of these fuels. Nevertheless, the knowledge of properties of chars (especially after severe devolatilization) is crucial for both modeling purposes (reactivity, kinetics of combustion and gasification, morphology variations, composition, and fate of <b>pollutant</b> <b>precursors)</b> and practical applications (boiler efficiency, ash deposition, and condensation causing fouling and slagging problems). This work deals with the characterization of chars from different classes of materials (biomasses, waste, and low and high volatile matter (VM) coals) obtained after a devolatilization performed in severe thermal conditions, i. e., high temperature and high heating rate. A methodological approach is developed, applied, and discussed, using an electrodynamic balance that is a versatile analyzer for the study of properties of single levitated particles. The specific heat, size, and shape distribution, and density variation between the char and the parent material are evaluated for all materials. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis is also carried Out to investigate morphological variations and support the major results obtained with the electrodynamic analyzer.

40|$|Over recent years, it {{has become}} {{increasingly}} apparent that climate change and air pollution need to be considered jointly for improved attribution and projections of human-caused changes in the earth system. Exchange processes at the land surface come into play in this context because many compounds that either act as greenhouse gases, as <b>pollutant</b> <b>precursors,</b> or both, have not only anthropogenic but also terrestrial sources and sinks. And since the fluxes of multiple gases and particulate matter between the terrestrial biota and the atmosphere are directly or indirectly coupled to vegetation and soil carbon, nutrient and water balances, quantification of their geographic patterns or changes over time requires due consideration of the underlying biological processes. In this review we highlight a number of critical aspects and recent progress in this respect, identifying in particular a number of areas where studies have shown that accounting for biological and ecological process understanding can alter global model projections of land-atmosphere interactions substantially. Specifically, this concerns the improved quantification of uncertainties and dynamic system responses, including acclimation, and the incorporation of exchange processes that so far have been missing from global models even though they are proposed to be of relevance for our understanding of terrestrial biota-climate feedbacks. Progress has also been made regarding studies on the impacts of land use/land cover change on climate change but the absence of a mechanistically-based representation of human response-processes limits our ability to analyse how climate change or air pollution in turn might affect human land use. A more integrated perspective is necessary and should become an active area of research that bridges the socio-economic and biophysical communities...|$|R
