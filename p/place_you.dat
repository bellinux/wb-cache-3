500|$|... "Slow Fade" [...] {{was written}} in the [...] "light of the well publicised falls from grace of several high profile church leaders". According to lead vocalist Mark Hall: [...] "Nobody falls, it's just a slow fade. It's a series of minor compromises until you're in a <b>place</b> <b>you</b> never thought you'd be, doing things you never thought you'd do and rationalising all of it". He {{continued}} by saying that: [...] "As believers, as men, if we're not guarding our relationship with God, we're going down. There's too much going against us. If we're not careful, we're going to crash and burn".|$|E

500|$|... "Back from Vacation" [...] {{was written}} by Justin Spitzer, a staff writer who joined The Office in its third season. The episode was his first script for the series. Spitzer found Jan's final scene with Michael– in which he expects she will yell at him for their {{circulated}} picture but instead informs him they are staying together– especially tricky to write. Spitzer was unsure how to craft the scene, and eventually requested advice from the other series' writers. They decided that Jan would give a [...] "psychobabble" [...] response to Michael. Sitting on a panel of television writers at Northwestern University, Spitzer briefly described her reasoning, [...] "Jan’s nuts. She has some bad psychiatrist giving her bad advice." [...] He praised {{the benefits of a}} [...] "good writers room," [...] in which [...] "scenes go to this <b>place</b> <b>you</b> never could have gone to alone." ...|$|E

[...] The singer also decided to record [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] because she wanted to shift her focus to the beauty industry, which she felt was [...] "the most humiliating, judgmental <b>place</b> <b>you</b> can be as a woman". She saw the track's theme as representation of [...] "finding that thing in the world that makes you truly happy," [...] and felt that the song was in line with the album's theme of [...] "finding beauty in imperfections". Speaking to iTunes Radio, Beyoncé explained: [...] "I feel like sometimes the world is a big contest, we're all being judged. I wanted to capture how humiliating and insecure that makes you feel." ...|$|E
500|$|After having {{arrived in}} the Hawaiian islands in 1778, Captain Cook sailed north and then {{north-east}} to explore {{the west coast of}} North America north of the Spanish settlements in Alta California. He made landfall on the Oregon coast at approximately 44°30′ north latitude, naming his landing point Cape Foulweather. Bad weather forced his ships south to about 43° north before they could begin their exploration of the coast northward. In March 1778, Cook landed on Bligh Island and named the inlet [...] "King George's Sound". He recorded that the native name was Nutka or Nootka, apparently misunderstanding his conversations at Friendly Cove/Yuquot; his informant may have been explaining that he was on an island (itchme nutka, a <b>place</b> <b>you</b> can [...] "go around"). There may also have been confusion with Nuu-chah-nulth, the natives' autonym (name for themselves). It may also have simply been based on Cook’s mispronunciation of Yuquot, the native name of the place.|$|E

500|$|Javie had an on-court {{incident}} {{during the}} 1990–91 NBA season {{in a game}} between the Portland Trail Blazers and Washington Bullets. Bullets' forward Pervis Ellison threw the ball at referee Billy Spooner prompting Javie to run across the court to impose a technical foul on Ellison. [...] In {{the sequence of events}} that followed, Javie ejected Ellison after protesting the call, the Bullets' head coach Wes Unseld for protesting the dismissal of Ellison, and the Bullets' mascot, [...] "Hoops", for making gestures to incite the crowd. [...] Rod Thorn, then the NBA's vice president for operations, ruled that Javie overreacted in ejecting Ellison and would be subject to discipline. The extent of the disciplinary action was not disclosed. [...] Javie reflected on the experience saying, [...] "My fatal mistake was getting involved with Billy [...] and Pervis [...] in the first <b>place.</b> <b>You</b> have to be there for your partners, {{but most of the time}} you've got to let them call their game." ...|$|E
500|$|Even though Besman had his {{own record}} label, Sensation Records, he {{licensed}} [...] "Boogie Chillen'" [...] to Los Angeles-based Modern Records. [...] On November 3, 1948, it was released nationally and Hooker commented on its immediate appeal: [...] "The thing caught afire. [...] It was ringin' all around the country. [...] When it come out, every juke box you went to, every <b>place</b> <b>you</b> went to... they were playing it there". [...] Because of the response, Nashville, Tennessee, radio station WLAC, a 50,000 watt clear-channel station that reached fifteen states and Canada, played the song ten {{times in a row}} during one broadcast night. [...] It entered the Billboard Race Records chart on January 8, 1949, where it remained for eighteen weeks, and reached number one on February 19, 1949. It became the most popular race record of 1949 and reportedly sold [...] "several hundred thousand" [...] to one million copies. [...] In an experience similar to Muddy Waters' 1950 hit [...] "Rollin' Stone", the song's popularity allowed Hooker to give up his factory job and concentrate on music.|$|E
500|$|Arnold then {{applied to}} {{accompany}} General Carleton, {{who was going}} to New York to replace Clinton as commander-in-chief; this request went nowhere. [...] Other attempts failed to gain positions within the government or the British East India Company over the next few years, and he was forced to subsist on the reduced pay of non-wartime service. [...] His reputation also came under criticism in the British press, especially when compared to that of Major André, who was celebrated for his patriotism. [...] One particularly harsh critic said that Arnold was a [...] "mean mercenary, who, having adopted a cause for the sake of plunder, quits it when convicted of that charge." [...] In turning him down for an East India Company posting, George Johnstone wrote, [...] "Although I am satisfied with the purity of your conduct, the generality do not think so.

500|$|Speaking of the song's lyrical background, Cruz told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul: [...] "Its about {{breaking}} a girl's heart, {{but in a}} way that's kinda not on purpose. It's more that I'm just a single guy, trying to be single and trying to remain single. And sometimes, when you are in that <b>place,</b> <b>you</b> get girls who wanna be a part of what you're about – but, because you're not really ready for a relationship, those girls can end up being heartbroken. So what I'm basically saying is 'I might just break your heart. But I'm only gonna break your heart if you come through this way right now'." [...] Cruz also has called his song [...] "catchy" [...] with a [...] "good melody" [...] and [...] "fun topic", stating that [...] "both girls and guys can get into this character". In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Cruz elaborated and said the song was partially based on a personal situation, and rather an [...] "exaggeration of an experience".|$|E
500|$|Stevenson was {{appointed}} a High Court judge on 1 October 1957, and (as is traditional) was knighted {{a few days}} later. From 1958 until 1960 {{he was a member}} of an Inter-Departmental Committee on Human Artificial Insemination. For the first four years of his judicial career Stevenson was assigned to the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, after which he was transferred to the Queen's Bench Division, where he presided over criminal cases. He then began to attract press attention. Known for his outspokenness, Stevenson described one case as a [...] "pretty anaemic kind of rape", because the victim was the accused's ex-girlfriend and had been hitch-hiking, before sentencing the man to a two-year suspended sentence. To a man acquitted of rape, he remarked [...] "I see you come from Slough. It is a terrible <b>place.</b> <b>You</b> can go back there." [...] In similar vein he told a husband involved in a divorce case that his decision to live in Manchester was [...] "a wholly incomprehensible choice for any free man to make".|$|E
500|$|The Prince-inspired [...] "Cross Dresser" [...] has a {{new wave}} style and {{whimsical}} lyrics in which the narrator holds on {{to the memory of}} his lost love by wearing her clothes. Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit: [...] "I just thought it was funny. It's {{one of those things that}} people talk about, but that's never really happened to me. But I literally wrote it in 20 minutes. It felt good ... It was really quick and I just thought it was something silly and funny." [...] "It's a Mysterious Hustle" [...] features somber strings, a languid rhythm, an eerie piano vamp, and bitter singing by Hunt. It was recorded solely by Hunt, who played guitar, keyboards, and electronic drums. Its lyrics are about having to [...] "work your way through the crowd" [...] and [...] "overcome the <b>place</b> <b>you</b> come from", and view the world as [...] "no place to raise a child". Its spoken word conclusion preaches, [...] "If you follow the beaten path, it will keep you tied to the past." ...|$|E

500|$|The Marble Index [...] "failed to {{challenge}} the supremacy of Nashville Skyline, From Elvis in Memphis, Abbey Road and Diana Ross & the Supremes Join the Temptations on the album charts of 1969". Although Holzman {{was pleased with the}} album, Nico's longevity with the label was unlikely; he was increasingly concerned with her heroin use and she had a difficult, irresponsible attitude. Nico left the United States before she was officially released from Elektra, after a violent incident in a New York City bar. Biographers refer to her leaving the U.S. as an exile; Nico said, [...] "When you live in a dangerous <b>place,</b> <b>you</b> also become increasingly dangerous. You might just wind up in jail." [...] In London she recorded two more albums with Cale in the same vein: Desertshore (1970) and The End... (1974), now considered parts of a trilogy. The album was reissued as a CD in 1991 with two bonus tracks. Songs off The Marble Index have been included in Nico compilations, including The Classic Years (1998), Femme Fatale (2002), and The Frozen Borderline – 1968–1970 (2007). To celebrate Elektra's 60th anniversary, [...] "Frozen Warnings" [...] was released as a single on October 25, 2010, with [...] "No One Is There" [...] as its B-side.|$|E
500|$|... "JJ" [...] {{was filmed}} in November 2008 {{in the same}} {{production}} block as the series' eighth episode, [...] "Effy". Ollie Barbieri did some research to help him in playing JJ, who has Asperger syndrome. He said that, in initial episodes, he played JJ as [...] "quite mad and I jumped around a lot", though by this episode his portrayal was [...] "watered down a bit". Charles Martin shot an unscripted scene that involved Barbieri destroying the set of JJ's bedroom; Martin believed this would help Barbieri to get into JJ's mindset. Barbieri was also able {{to learn more about}} his character by creating the collage in JJ's room himself, in which JJ has tried to organise his thoughts about his friends and his life. Martin said that he and Barbieri had a [...] "very involved director-actor relationship" [...] and that he enjoyed [...] "JJ" [...] the most out of all the episodes he directed in the series. According to runner Laurence Wigfield, JJ's clinic was described in the script as [...] "a desolate shabby place, the kind of <b>place</b> <b>you</b> went to die", with the bracketed suggestion of Fishponds Studio, where the Skins offices are. Though Wigfield initially [...] "couldn't believe" [...] this, the studio was used for filming the scene, which Wigfield admitted [...] "worked quite well". The scene in which JJ and Emily bond after meeting at the clinic was filmed in Bristol's Brandon Hill Park, near Cabot Tower.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Ruffalo said he {{believed}} the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, [...] "I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it. When we did The Avengers it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version {{of what it would}} be." [...] In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in Phase Two of the MCU, by saying, [...] "After the first Avengers, Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in [...] So it was really about, frankly, saving somebody so that the only <b>place</b> <b>you</b> could get Hulk between Avengers movies is the next Avengers movie, so [...] could continue to play with that in [...] Where we go after that, we'll see." [...] In October 2014, again on a solo film, Feige said [...] "we'll see. We'd love to do it, we'd love to find the place to put it, but right now, Hulk will be appearing, with his friends, in their [...] films." ...|$|E
