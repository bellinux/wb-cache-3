Lincoln's overcoat has a slightly rumpled appearance and front chair legs appear to be modeled after massive wood pilasters or simulated logs.

Both feet are planted on a small stone tablet or slab; the entire chair rests on an even larger stone tablet.

"Daniel Chester French (1850 - 1931) was one of the most prolific sculptors of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. After studying in the U. S. and Italy, he worked on commission, earning his first significant contract at age 23, for "The Minute Man" (Concord, Mass.) His most famous work was the seated Lincoln statue at the Lincoln Memorial, dedicated in 1922. The Alexander Gardner portrait of Lincoln served as a model for this memorial piece, and French made several sketches for this project between 1912 and 1915 before completion of the mammoth statue. This reproduction of the scale model figurine was issued by Alva Museum Replicas, a business dating from at least the 1950 s through 1990 s. It specialized in producing museum reproductions, in figurines as well as in jewelry pieces, based on work of the original artists. The reproduction was based on French's 1915 scale model for the Lincoln Memorial statue.

40|$|Abstract. If the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> {{adhesive}} is {{coated on}} the back, {{it can be}} used for bonding electronic tag, overburden, protective layer, and RFID layer. The acrylate <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> adhesives are simple and less pollution, so more and more companies pay attention on this kind of binder. Since the thickness of adhesive layer is relatively small, ink-jet printing is now widely used to easily obtain thin layer and design the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> adhesive shape of different parts. So how to get superior performance <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> adhesive which is suitable for ink-jet printing become an urgent problem in printed electronics. The experiment was conducted through solution copolymerization of various vinyl monomers which were selected on the principle of solvent parameter prepared by free radical polymerization. The monomer, initiator mixture solution was dropped in continuous and synchronization process. By regulating the amount of initiator and polymerization temperature, we could effectively reduce the system viscosity and prepare high quality high-solids acrylate UV-curable <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> adhesives with low viscosity for ink-jet printing.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{measurements of}} static {{pressures on the}} stator vane suction side of a high-speed single stage fan using the technique of <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint (PSP). The paper illustrates development in application of the relatively new experimental technique to the complex environment of internal flows in turbomachines. First, there is a short explanation of the physics of the PSP technique and a discussion of calibration methods for <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint in the turbomachinery environment. A description of the image conversion process follows. The recorded image of the stator vane pressure field is skewed due to the limited optical access and must be converted to the meridional plane projection for comparison with analytical predictions. The experimental results for seven operating conditions along an off-design rotational speed line are shown in a concise form, including performance map points, mindspan static tap pressure distributions, and vane suction side pressure fields. Then, a comparison between static tap and <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint data is discussed.

40|$|Pyrene-based <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paints (PSP) {{have certain}} {{advantages}} {{due to their}} high pressure sensitivity and low temperature coefficient but their major drawback is the paint degradation under wind tunnel conditions.

The <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint also contains an additional reference luminophore, which is insensitive to <b>pressure</b> but <b>sensitive</b> to intensity variations on the model surface.

40|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> {{paint is}} a newly-developed optical {{measurement}} technique with {{which one can}} get a continuous pressure distribution in much shorter time and lower cost than a conventional pressure tap measurement. However, most of the current <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint applications are restricted to steady pressure measurement at high speeds {{because of the small}} signal-to-noise ratio at low speed and a slow response to pressure changes. In the present study, three phases of work have been completed to extend the application of the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint technique to low-speed testing and to investigate the applicability of the paint technique to unsteady flow. First the measurement system using a commercially available PtOEP/GP- 197 <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint was established and applied to impinging jet measurements. An in-situ calibration using only five pressure tap data points was applied and the results showed good repeatability and good agreement with conventional pressure tap measurements on the whole painted area. The overall measurement accuracy in these experiments was found to be within 0. 1 psi. The <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint technique was then applied to low-speed wind tunnel tests using a 60 deg delta wing model with leading edge blowing slots. The technical problems encountered in low-speed testing were resolved by using a high grade CCD camera and applying corrections to improve the measurement accuracy. Even at 35 m/s, the paint data not only agreed well with conventional pressure tap measurements but also clearly showed the suction region generated by the leading edge vortices. The vortex breakdown was also detected at alpha= 30 deg. It was found that a pressure difference of 0. 2 psi was required for a quantitative pressure measurement in this experiment and that temperature control or a parallel temperature measurement is necessary if thermal uniformity does not hold on the model. Finally, the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint was applied to a periodically changing pressure field with a 12. 8 s time period. A simple first-order pole model was applied to deal with the phase lag of the paint. The unsteady pressure estimated from the time-changing <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> paint data agreed well with the pressure transducer data in regions of higher pressure and showed the possibility of extending the technique to unsteady pressure measurements. However, the model still needs further refinement based on the physics of the oxygen diffusion into the paint layer and the oxygen quenching on the paint luminescence...|$|R
