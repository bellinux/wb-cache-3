40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{optimize}} the biomass growth of Schizochytrium limacinum SR 21.

40|$|AbstractThe {{demand for}} renewably sourced {{biodegradable}} materials {{has increased the}} need to produce materials that combine appropriate functional properties at competitive costs. Thermoplastic starch and polyester blends are an interesting alternative to current materials due to the low cost of starch and the functional properties and processability of the resulting blends.

30|$|When crude {{glycerol}} {{was directly}} used as carbon source, the overall two-stage fermentation lasted 131  h, {{in which the}} anaerobic stage lasted 98  h. Under the aerobic growth stage, the untreated crude glycerol showed negative effect on cell growth, and the μmax was only 0.184 /h, which were 9.3 % and 12.8 % {{lower than that of}} using the treated crude glycerol and pure glycerol, respectively (Table  2). During the anaerobic stage, the utilization of the untreated crude glycerol was inhibited dramatically and only 54.2  mM glycerol was consumed; the final succinate concentration was only 50.3  mM. The yields of succinate were 0.11  mol/mol in the whole two-stage fermentation and 0.93  mol/mol in the anaerobic stage (Table  2). The specific succinate productivity dropped sharply during the anaerobic stage (data not shown). However, succinate production was significantly improved when the simply <b>purified</b> crude <b>glycerol</b> was used as carbon source. The titer of succinate achieved 566.0  mM, which was 11.2 times that produced by the cells used crude glycerol as carbon source. The specific succinate productivity was also much higher than that of using untreated crude glycerol (Table  2). Compared with the pure glycerol, the specific succinate productivity and the specific glycerol consumption rate were decreased by 27 % and 34 %, respectively. However, the final succinate concentration of the simply <b>purified</b> crude <b>glycerol</b> condition dropped slightly to 91.9 % of using the pure glycerol, which indicated that the residual impurities in the simply <b>purified</b> crude <b>glycerol</b> exhibited slight influence on succinate production. The yield of succinate changed little, somehow, even a little higher than that of using the pure glycerol. Similar finding was also reported by Zhou et al. (2014), which indicated that the yield of fumaric acid based on glycerol consumption was improved significantly on crude glycerol medium in comparison to pure glycerol. In addition, our results further indicated that the activated carbon absorption is a convenient and favourable way to reduce the inhibitory effect of the crude glycerol, and the engineered E. coli has good ability to utilize the simply <b>purified</b> crude <b>glycerol</b> for succinate production.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  1, {{we found that}} crude {{glycerol}} inhibited glycerol consumption and succinate production. The previous study has also shown that crude glycerol inhibits the production of succinate by E. coli (Sadhukhan et al. 2016). In this study, when the simply <b>purified</b> crude <b>glycerol</b> was used as carbon source, the inhibition of glycerol consumption and succinate production was significantly reduced compared with those using crude glycerol. Some unknown harmful components in crude glycerol might be partially adsorbed by the activated carbon. However, there might be still a few harmful components left in the simply <b>purified</b> crude <b>glycerol,</b> which had slightly affected glycerol consumption and succinate production. In the previous studies, to efficient utilization of the crude glycerol, it must be treated {{with a series of}} complicated steps, such as containing acidification, solvent extraction, activated carbon absorption, precipitation of the fatty acids with calcium, etc. (Manosak et al. 2011; Pott et al. 2014). While we only apply one of the steps, activated carbon absorption can reduce the inhibition of crude glycerol and improve the succinate production significantly.|$|R
30|$|Biodiesel is {{made through}} a {{chemical}} process called trans-esterification from animal fat and vegetable oils. The process generates two products, fatty acid alkyl esters, the chemical name for biodiesel, and glycerol (a valuable byproduct usually sold for soaps and other products).

Some biodiesel-derived glycerol is refined to high purity for commercial applications, {{but this is}} a costly process (da Silva et al. 2009). Disposal of the waste crude glycerol in municipal sewage systems is prohibited in many jurisdictions, or is associated with a disposal fee. Moreover, it is not economically feasible for small biodiesel plants to <b>purify</b> <b>glycerol.</b> Thus, impurities such as free fatty acids, methanol, heavy metals and salts (NaCl) in crude glycerol render biodiesel-derived glycerol as a “waste” product (Chatzifragkou and Papanikolaou 2012; Vandamme and Coenye 2004; Fu et al. 2015).

30|$|Photofermentation is the bio-hydrogen {{production}} from organic {{matter in the}} presence of light. Photofermentation is normally performed using organic acids; however, some purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria can also transform glycerol into bio-hydrogen directly (Ghosh et al. 2012 a; Sabourin-Provost and Hallenbeck 2009). Rhodopseudomonas palustris, a purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacterium, incremented the hydrogen yield 6 times compared with Enterobacter aerogenes or E. coli (Ghosh et al. 2012 b). Rhodopseudomonas palustris increased hydrogen production in cultures with high nitrogen concentration (Sabourin-Provost and Hallenbeck 2009) and by optimizing crude glycerol concentration (30  mM), glutamate concentration (4.5  mM), and light intensity (175  W/m 2) (Ghosh et al. 2012 a). Similar to dark fermentation, photofermentation is highly inhibited by SFFA. Pott et al. (2013) demonstrated that SFFA is the most important inhibitor in crude glycerol, generating a reduction in the growth rate of R. palustris (Pott et al. 2013). To reduce the SFFA concentration in the crude glycerol, Pott et al. (2014) evaluated different techniques (ethanol and activated carbon, pH adjustment, solvent extraction, and precipitation of the fatty acids with calcium) to reduce SFFA concentration. The best two treatments included pH adjustment and SFFA precipitation with calcium salts. These two treatments (23 – 27  ml/g/h) generated similar hydrogen yields as highly <b>purified</b> <b>glycerol</b> (29  ml/g/h) (Pott et al. 2014).

In the present study, the regulation of glycerol uptake was examined in a wild-type strain of E. faecalis {{as well as in}} tight and leaky ptsI mutants, altered with respect to their levels of enzyme I of the PTS. Glycerol kinase was shown to be weakly repressible by lactose and strongly repressible by glucose in the wild-type strain. Greatly reduced levels of glycerol kinase activity were also observed in the ptsI mutants. Uptake of glycerol into intact wild-type and mutant cells paralleled the glycerol kinase activities in extracts. Glycerol uptake in the leaky ptsI mutant was hypersensitive to inhibition by low concentrations of 2 -deoxyglucose or glucose even though the rates and extent of 2 -deoxyglucose uptake were greatly reduced. These observations provide strong support for the involvement of reversible PTS-mediated phosphorylation of glycerol kinase in the regulation of glycerol uptake in response to {{the presence or absence of}} a sugar substrate of the PTS in the medium. Glucose and 2 -deoxyglucose were shown to elicit rapid efflux of cytoplasmic [14 C]lactate derived from [14 C]glycerol. This phenomenon was distinct from the inhibition of glycerol uptake and was due to phosphorylation of the incoming sugar by cytoplasmic phosphoenolpyruvate.

40|$|To replace {{environmentally}} unfriendly petrochemical production processes, {{the demand}} for bio-based production of organic chemicals is increasing. This thesis focuses on the biological production of hydroxylated aromatics from renewable substrates by engineered P. putida S 12 including several cases of strain improvement. Chapter 2 describes {{the construction of a}} P. putida S 12 strain that produces p-hydroxybenzoate via the aromatic amino acid tyrosine. Previous research on biosynthesis of aromatic compounds has culminated in the construction of P. putida S 12 _ 427. This strain, which has an optimized carbon flux towards tyrosine, was employed as platform host for aromatics production. By introducing the heterologous gene pal/tal (encoding phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia lyase; Pal/Tal) the conversion of tyrosine into p-coumarate was established, which compound is further converted into p-hydroxybenzoate by endogenous enzymes. The degradation of p-hydroxybenzoate was prevented by inactivating the gene pobA, which encodes hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. The resulting strain, P. putida S 12 palB 1, accumulated p-hydroxybenzoate at a yield of 11 Cmol % on glucose or glycerol in shake flask cultivations. A glycerol-limited fed-batch cultivation was performed to increase the product titers, yielding a final p-hydroxybenzoate concentration of 12. 9 mM (1. 8 g l- 1) with a product-to-substrate yield of 8. 5 Cmol %. Tyrosine availability was identified as the main bottleneck for p-hydroxybenzoate production in glycerol-limited chemostat cultivations. Since the enhanced flux towards p-hydroxybenzoate in P. putida S 12 palB 1 mainly originated from a random mutagenesis approach, multiple system-wide changes were expected. Therefore, a chemostat-based comparative transcriptomics and proteomics analysis was performed as described in Chapter 3, to gain insight into the genetic background of the enhanced strain performance. The overall expression differences between parent strain and P. putida S 12 palB 1 confirmed the system-wide changes effectuated by the strain improvement procedure. The higher net metabolic flux towards p-hydroxybenzoate was reflected in the upregulation of genes involved in tyrosine biosynthesis and the conversion of p-coumarate into p-hydroxybenzoate. Notably, on glucose some of the p-hydroxybenzoate biosynthetic genes were upregulated to a higher extent than in the glycerol-grown chemostats, while the phydroxybenzoate accumulation was not affected by the carbon source applied. Furthermore, a multidrug efflux transporter (PP 1271 -PP 1273) was identified that may have a major role in phydroxybenzoate export. The 2. 8 -fold upregulation of hpd (encoding 4 -hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase; first enzyme of tyrosine degradation via the homogentisate pathway) on glucose suggested that part of the tyrosine was directed away from p-hydroxybenzoate biosynthesis. This was confirmed by a 22 -% increase of the product-to-substrate yield upon eliminating hpd. Although the hpd gene was not significantly differentially expressed on glycerol (1. 5 -fold), hpd deletion resulted in a 21 % improved p-hydroxybenzoate yield also on glycerol. The key precursors for the production of aromatic compounds, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and erythrose- 4 -phosphate (E 4 P), are withdrawn from the lower glycolysis, respectively, the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway. Since the flux through the PP pathway is typically low in P. putida S 12, the availability of E 4 P may be a bottleneck for p-hydroxybenzoate production. In Chapter 4, it was attempted to increase the availability of E 4 P by co-feeding xylose directly into the PP pathway. To this end, the genes xylABFGH (encoding xylose isomerase, xylulokinase and a high affinity xylose transporter) were introduced in the phydroxybenzoate producing strain to establish growth on xylose via the PP pathway. Growth performance on xylose was improved by an evolutionary selection approach. Surprisingly, this also resulted in a 25 -% improvement of p-hydroxybenzoate production on either glycerol or glucose, indicating that the resulting strain, P. putida S 12 pal_xylB 7, had an intrinsically elevated PP pathway activity. Chemostat experiments demonstrated that co-feeding of xylose (replacing part of the glucose or glycerol in the feed) considerably increased the production efficiency. On glucose, co-feeding of xylose improved the product-to-substrate yield by a factor 1. 5 to 7. 9 Cmol %, while on glycerol the product-to-substrate yield doubled to 16. 3 Cmol %. Interestingly, product formation was not further improved by replacing more than 25 % of the carbon feed with xylose. This suggested that the availability of E 4 P was no longer the limiting step in p-hydroxybenzoate biosynthesis. The ability of co-utilizing xylose and glucose and the resultant improved production parameters implicated that lignocellulosic feedstock, containing around 20 % xylose and 50 % glucose, is a very suitable substrate for the production of aromatic compounds by engineered P. putida S 12. In Chapter 5 the utilization of the industrial grade renewable feedstock crude glycerol was evaluated. In high-cell density fed-batch fermentations, P. putida S 12 strains performed consistently better on crude glycerol than on <b>purified</b> <b>glycerol,</b> as shown by the higher biomass-to-substrate yield, maximum biomass production rate and substrate uptake rate. Moreover, the production of p-hydroxybenzoate by an engineered P. putida S 12 strain was more efficient on crude glycerol. On crude glycerol a maximum p-hydroxybenzoate concentration of 43. 5 mM (6. 0 g l- 1) was obtained with a product-to-substrate yield of 6. 6 Cmol %, compared to 38. 4 mM (5. 3 g l- 1) and 5. 9 Cmol % on <b>purified</b> <b>glycerol.</b> In contrast, E. coli DH 5 ? showed a decreased biomass-to-substrate yield and growth rate on crude glycerol compared to <b>purified</b> <b>glycerol,</b> and increased acetate formation (11. 5 and 16. 2 g l- 1 on purified and crude glycerol respectively). The majority of the optimization approaches described in this thesis for p-hydroxybenzoate production can be applied for efficient production of other tyrosine derived compounds. This is exemplified in Chapter 6, where the production of the value-added compound phydroxystyrene from glucose is described. Production of p-hydroxystyrene was established by introducing the genes pal/tal and pdc, encoding phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia lyase and p-coumaric acid decarboxylase respectively, into the tyrosine overproducing strain P. putida S 12 _ 427. These enzymes allow the conversion of the central metabolite tyrosine into p-hydroxystyrene, via p-coumarate. Degradation of the p-coumarate intermediate was prevented by inactivating the fcs gene encoding feruloyl-CoA synthetase. In fed-batch cultivation on glucose a maximum p-hydroxystyrene concentration of 4. 5 mM was obtained with a yield of 6. 7 Cmol %. At this p-hydroxystyrene concentration, growth and production were completely halted due to the toxicity of p-hydroxystyrene. Product toxicity was overcome by the application of a second phase of 1 -decanol to extract p-hydroxystyrene during fedbatch cultivation. This approach resulted in a final p-hydroxystyrene concentration of 147 mM (17. 6 g l- 1) in the decanol phase, with a twofold increase of the maximum volumetric productivity (0. 75 mM h- 1) and a fourfold higher total concentration (21 mM). The work described in this thesis illustrates how hydroxylated aromatics can be efficiently produced by engineered P. putida S 12 strains. Several strategies for analysis and optimization were performed to improve the aromatics production and understand the background and impact of the improvements. The biological production of various hydroxylated aromatics was established and largely improved. Hence, this work presents an important contribution to our efforts to replace petrochemical production by bio-based processes. BiotechnologyApplied Science...|$|E

Ein analytisches Instrument, welches dieses Anforderungsprofil erfüllt, ist das ToF (Time-of-Flight) - SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscope). Glycerol-Diphytanyl-Diether und Glycerol-Diphytanyl-Glycerol- Tetraether wurden als Reinsubstanzen auf ihr Fragmentierungsverhalten mit MALDI (Matrix-unterstützte Laser- Desorption/Ionisation) -MS/MS und ToF-SIMS untersucht gefolgt von ToF-SIMS Messungen von Prokaryonten. Von primären Interesse war ein spezielles GDGT - Crenarchaeol - welches einzigartig für das Phylum Thaumarchaeota (chemolithoautotrophe Ammoniak oxidierende Archaea) ist. Das Ziel dieser Masterarbeit war die Identifizierung von Crenarchaeol-Ionen, -Addukten und -Fragmenten welche zur Identifizierung von Thaumarchaeota im Gemisch mit anderen Prokaryoten genutzt werden können. Methoden Analysiert wurden zwei Glycerol-Diphytanyl-Diether (1, 2 -Di-O-Phytanyl-sn-Glycerol und 1, 2 -Di-O-Phytanyl-sn-Glycero- 3 -Phosphoethanolamin) und ein Glycerol-Diphytanyl-Glycerol- Tetraether (Crenarchaeol) unter Verwendung von ToF-SIMS und MALDI-MS. Spektren wurden mit Hilfe gängiger Molekülsignale [M]+, [M]-, Fragmenten und Addukten analysiert. Weiters wurden zwei Prokaryonten (Archaeon N. viennensis und Bakterium E. coli) mit ToF-SIMS analysiert. Die Spektren dieser Organismen wurden mit Hilfe von bekannten Biomarkern für Biomasse untersucht. Weiters wurden Methoden der multivarianten Statistik (PCA und Korrelationsanalysen) zur Auswertung angewendet. Auch wurde im Bioinformatik-Teil dieser Arbeit nach zwei noch nicht charakterisierten Enzymen im Biosynthesepfad von Crenarchaeol mit Hilfe von orthologen Genen, phylogenetischen und biochemischen Überlegungen gesucht. Resultate und Zusammenfassung MALDI-MS zeigte positive Molekülsignale für beide Glycerol-Diphytanyl-Diether, jedoch nicht für Crenarchaeol. ToF-SIMS konnte bei allen drei Reinsubstanzen positive Molekülsignale zeigen. Die folgende Analyse der Prokaryonten mit ToF-SIMS konnte Crenarchaeol in Archaea nicht nachweisen - jedoch wurde ein Fragment gefunden welches von Crenarchaeol stammen könnte. Die ToF-SIMS Analyse war häufig nicht in der Lage die Topologie der Zellen mit mittleren bis hohen Massen abzubilden. Weiters war es oft nicht möglich zwischen Bereichen mit Biomasse und Bereichen ohne Biomasse mit Hilfe der Spektren zu unterscheiden und die Intensität für Moleküle über 600 Dalton war sehr gering. Die Zerstörung der Oberfläche durch den primären Ionenstrahl war zu vollständig und der Ioneneinschlag fragmentierte die organischen Moleküle an und unter der Oberfläche. Die statistische Analyse ergab, dass es bei gemittelten und normierten Spektren möglich ist mittels PCA zwischen E. coli und N. viennensis zu unterschei- den. Die Loadings, welche hierfür verantwortlich waren, sind jedoch wahrscheinlicher ein Resultat unterschiedlicher Präparationsmethoden. Die Suche nach den zwei noch nicht charakterisierten Enzymen im Biosynthesepfad von Crenarchaeol ergab eine Liste von möglichen Kandidaten welche als Startpunkt für weitere biochemische Untersuchungen verwendet werden kann. Glycerol diphytanyl diethers and glycerol diphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGT) {{are major}} components of archaeal lipids {{and could be}} utilized as a biomarker to differentiate between archaea and bacteria given an instrument that is able to resolve mass spectra in the high mass range with high lateral resolution and mass accuracy. An instrument possessing such features is the ToF (Time-of-Flight) - SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscope). Spectra of pure substances of Glycerol diphytanyl diethers and GDGTs were analyzed with MALDI-MS/MS and ToF-SIMS to find significant fragments for these lipids followed by ToF-SIMS measurements of prokaryotes to test the utility of these fragments in a real life application. One specific GDGT - crenarchaeol - is unique for the phylum thaumarcheaota (chemolithoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizers) and {{the aim of this}} thesis was to find crenarchaeol ions and fragments with sufficient intensity to identify thaumarchaeota in a mixture of different prokaryotes. Methods Spectra were obtained from two glycerol diphytanyl diethers (1, 2 -Di-O-Phytanyl-sn-Glycerol and 1, 2 -Di-O-Phytanyl-sn-Glycero- 3 -Phosphoethanolamine) and one glycerol diphytanyl glycerol tetraether (crenarchaeol) using ToF-SIMS and MALDI-MS. Spectra were analyzed for the molecular ion peak ([M]+ and [M]-), fragments and adducts. Two prokaryotes (the bacteria E. coli and the thaumarchaota N. viennensis) were analyzed using ToF-SIMS. The spectra of the prokaryotes were investigated using known biomark- ers for organic substances and subsequently with multivariate statistical tools (PCA and correlation coefficients). Furthermore in a bioinformatic subproject of this thesis an anal- ysis for two missing enzymes in the biosynthesis pathway of crenarchaeol was performed using cluster of orthologous genes, phylogenetic and biochemical considerations. Results and Summary It was possible to identify the molecule ion peak for the <b>purified</b> <b>glycerol</b> diphytanyl diethers with MALDI-MS but {{it was not possible to}} find the molecule ion peak for crenarchaeol in the MALDI-MS spectra. We were able to identify the molecule ion and the Na+ adduct peak of all analyzed molecules using ToF-SIMS but for crenarchaeol the intensity was very low. In the subsequent analysis of creanarchaeol in the membrane of entire prokaryotic cells this finding was not reproducible - only one fragment was found that might originate from crenarchaeol. ToF-SIMS analysis was often not able to reconstruct the contour of clusters of prokaryotes as seen in the microscope using high to medium molecular masses. Furthermore it was not possible to differ between single cells of archaea and also hardly possible to distinguish single E. coli cells - the lateral resolution and secondary ion yield was too little for organic medium to high molecular mass molecules. In addition it was not always possible to distinguish between biomass and non-biomass and the intensity of high-molecular mass peaks (above 600) was very low. The destruction of organic molecules on the surface and beneath by the erosion gun using Cs+ or O+ 2 in combination with the analysis gun using Bi+ 3 was most likely too severe. The statistical analysis (PCA) of mean-centered and normalized spectra showed that it was possible to distinguish between E. coli and N. viennensis. For the two missing enzymes in the biosynthesis pathway of crenarchaeol it was possible to give a ranked list of in silico predicted candidate genes, which should be used as a guideline for further research...|$|E

The polymerase activity was <b>purified</b> on <b>glycerol</b> gradients and by phosphocellulose column chromatography; the viral proteins {{present in the}} active enzyme fractions were identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was demonstrated that L protein, but not NS protein, was required for in vitro RNA synthesis on the VS viral nucleocapsid template. Solubilized L protein rebinds to the ribonucleoprotein template when the transcription complex is reconstituted, and the RNA synthesized in vitro by purified L protein hybridizes to virion RNA. Cyanogen bromide peptide fingerprints indicate that the large L protein is a unique polypeptide chain. It is concluded that the L protein functions as the transcriptase, and the nucleocapsid NS protein is not essential for in vitro RNA synthesis...|$|R

40|$|Analytical ultracentrifugation, thermal denaturation, and {{electron}} microscopy {{have been used}} to study nucleoprotein core particles, obtained from disrupted type 5 adenovirus and partially <b>purified</b> on <b>glycerol</b> density gradients. Electron microscopy at low salt concentrations has shown that the cores are homogeneous particles with characteristic structures, which vary with conditions of observation from a fairly loose network of fibers to a highly condensed, compact particle. Sedimentation measurements in the analytical ultracentrifuge, both by boundary and by band techniques, show that the cores are relatively homogeneous in solution and have sedimentation coefficients near 185 S at low salt concentrations, about 243 S in 1 or 2 M NaCl, and 376 S in 1 mM MgCl 2. Correlation of sedimentation data with electron microscopic observations suggests that the 185 S particle has a loose, fibrous structure, while the faster species are more highly condensed particles. The melting temperature of the cores in 5 mM Tris/HCl is 79 degrees C, which is 10 degrees C higher than the Tm for purified, viral DNA. This indicates that the protein enhances the stability of DNA in the nucleoprotein complex...|$|R
