50|$|A pillow block, {{also known}} as a <b>plummer</b> <b>block</b> or housed bearing unit, is a {{pedestal}} used to provide support for a rotating shaft with the help of compatible bearings & various accessories. Housing material for a pillow block is typically made of cast iron or cast steel.|$|E

5000|$|Established in 2003, NTN Bearing Service Co. {{was formed}} by Higashinihon NTN Service Corporation, who was a wholly owned {{subsidiary}} of NTN Corporation at the time. Kyushu NTN Corporation was absorbed into the wholly owned subsidiary, which also took control of Osaka NTN Pillow Center Corporation in Kansai. The consolidation was part of structural reform plan [...] "NEW Plan 21", {{which is based on}} the philosophy that growth in distributor size will improve the organization's capability to deliver product. The company sells and distributes ball bearings, bearing units, needle roller bearings, parts feeders and <b>plummer</b> <b>blocks.</b> The company has facilities in Hokkaido, Kyushu, Osaka and Tohoku.|$|R

40|$|The act of {{condition}} monitoring {{has actually been}} practiced by plant engineers for generating or estimating, how long {{a part of the}} equipment can continue in service until it needs to be shut down for repair using traditional touch, see and hear methods. The applications of computers, electronic measuring and detecting systems have provided a new approach to {{condition monitoring}}. The analysis of the information provided by the sensor output is done by using established techniques and interpretation of evaluated output, is then used to establish what actions are to be taken. The use of vibration signals is quite common in the field of condition monitoring of rotating machinery. In this paper, an attempt has been made to monitor the condition of a combustion air fan located at Wire Rod Mill Department in Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, India. The fan unit is supported by four <b>Plummer</b> <b>blocks,</b> two at motor end and the other two at fan end. Using the accelerometer, the velocities at the bearings are recorded and analyzed using ISO 2372 codes for identification of fault/ faults. The fault diagnosis had been supplemented with signatures recorded. Remedial measures are suggested to bring down the intensity of offensive signal. Fault diagnosis has been taken up {{with the help of an}} expert system developed in C#. ne...|$|R
25|$|On May 13, 1899, the LIRR {{bought the}} Montauk Steamboat Company, which had competed {{with its own}} steamboats for {{connecting}} freight and passenger service. Routes operated under LIRR control included New York-Greenport and connections from the eastern terminals to New London and Block Island. Most of the lines ran until the 1910s, when they were abandoned due to competition from highways and the U.S. Navy Department prohibiting operation through <b>Plum</b> Gut (to <b>Block</b> Island) in 1917; the New London connection continued until 1927.|$|R
