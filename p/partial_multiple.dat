All Azorean lava-tubes and {{volcanic}} pits with fauna {{were evaluated}} for species diversity and rarity based on arthropods. To produce an unbiased multiple-criteria index (importance value for conservation, IV-C) incorporating arthropod species diversity based indices and indices qualifying geological and management features (e. g. diversity of geological structures, threats, accessibility, etc.), an iterative <b>partial</b> <b>multiple</b> {{regression analysis was}} performed. In addition, the complementarity method (using heuristic methods) was used for priority-cave analyses. Most hypogean endemic species have restricted distributions, occurring only in one cave.

40|$|ABSTRACT Here, we presentMultiProt, a fully {{automated}} highly efficient technique to detect mul-tiple structural alignments of protein structures. MultiProt finds the common geometrical cores be-tween input molecules. To date, most methods for multiple alignment {{start from the}} pairwise align-ment solutions. This {{may lead to a}} small overall alignment. In contrast, our method derives multiple alignments from simultaneous superpositions of in-put molecules. Further, our method does not re-quire that all input molecules participate in the alignment. Actually, it efficiently detects high scor-ing <b>partial</b> <b>multiple</b> alignments for all possible num-ber of molecules in the input. To demonstrate the power of MultiProt, we provide a number of case studies. First, wedemonstrate knownmultiple align-ments of protein structures to illustrate the perfor-mance ofMultiProt. Next,wepresent various biologi-cal applications. These include: (1) a partial alignment of hinge-bent domains; (2) identification of functional groups of G-proteins; (3) analysis of binding sites; and (4) protein-protein interface align-ment. Some applications preserve the sequence or-der of the residues in the alignment, whereas others are order-independent. It is their residue sequence order-independence that allows application of MultiProt to derive multiple alignments of binding sites and of protein-protein interfaces, making Mul-tiProt an extremely useful structural tool.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a definition of}} a construction for long polar codes. Recently, we know that partial order is a universal property of the construction with a sublinear complexity for polar codes. In order to describe the partial order, addition and left-swap operators are only defined as universal up to now. In this study, we first propose 1 +_ 2 _ 2 N universal operators to describe <b>multiple</b> <b>partial</b> order for the block length N= 2 ^n. By using these operators, some known antichains can be universally ordered. Furthermore, by using a simple geometric property of Gaussian approximation, we define an attractor that is a pre-defined subset of synthetic channels. They are universally less reliable than the natural channel W. Then, we show that the cardinality of this attractor is (n+ 2) -th Fibonacci number which is a significantly large number of channels for long codes. The main contribution {{is that there are}} significant number of synthetic channels explicitly defined as almost useless by the help of attractor and <b>multiple</b> <b>partial</b> order. As a result, proposed attractor with <b>multiple</b> <b>partial</b> order can be seen as an efficient tool to investigate and design extremely long codes...|$|R

A coherent wave propagation model is used to simulate the propagation through foliage. The coherent model is composed of two components: a forest stand generator that makes use of a stochastic fractal model, and an electromagnetic model that makes use of Foldy’s approximation and single scattering. An outdoor measurement system is designed and used for characterizing the channel behavior for a pine tree stand at Ka-band (35 GHz). In this experiment, 84 independent spatial samples of transmitted signal through the pine stand were collected to obtain the path-loss statistics.

40|$|The {{one which}} is {{considered}} the standard model of theory change was presented in [AGM 85] and {{is known as the}} AGM model. In particular, that paper introduced the class of partial meet contractions. In subsequent works several alternative constructive models for that same class of functions were presented, e. g. : safe/kernel contractions ([AM 85, Han 94]), system of spheres-based contractions ([Gro 88]) and epistemic entrenchment-based contractions ([G ar 88, GM 88]). Besides, several generalizations of such model were investigated. In that regard we emphasise the presentation of models which accounted for contractions by sets of sentences rather than only by a single sentence, i. e. multiple contractions. However, until now, only two of the above mentioned models have been generalized in the sense of addressing the case of contractions by sets of sentences: The <b>partial</b> meet <b>multiple</b> contractions were presented in [Han 89, FH 94], while the kernel multiple contractions were introduced in [FSS 03]. In this thesis we propose two new constructive models of multiple contraction functions, namely the system of spheres-based and the epistemic entrenchment-based multiple contractions which generalize the models of system of spheres-based and of epistemic entrenchment-based contractions, respectively, to the case of contractions (of theories) by sets of sentences. Furthermore, analogously to what is the case in what concerns the corresponding classes of contraction functions by one single sentence, those two classes are identical and constitute a subclass of the class of <b>partial</b> meet <b>multiple</b> contractions. Additionally, and as the rst step of the procedure that is here followed to obtain an adequate de nition for the system of spheres-based multiple contractions, we present a possible worlds semantics for the <b>partial</b> meet <b>multiple</b> contractions analogous to the one proposed in [Gro 88] for the partial meet contractions (by one single sentence).
