50|$|Ink {{cartridges}} {{are typically}} priced at $13 to $75 per ounce ($1,664 to $9,600 per gallon) of ink, meaning that refill cartridges sometimes cost a substantial {{fraction of the}} cost of the printer. To save money, many people use compatible ink cartridges from a vendor other than the printer manufacturer. Others use aftermarket inks, refilling their own ink cartridges using a kit that includes bulk ink. The high cost of cartridges has also provided an incentive for counterfeiters to supply cartridges falsely claiming to be made by the original manufacturer. The <b>print</b> <b>cartridge</b> industry lost an estimated $3 billion in 2009 due to this, according to an International Data Corporation estimate.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was to {{describe}} consumers behaviour in the market with regards to <b>print</b> <b>cartridges</b> and to recommend the most suitable products {{to them on the}} basis of the established preferences and attributes. I used a questionnaire survey and a calculation of <b>print</b> <b>cartridges</b> parameter weights using the method of multi-criteria decision making. I found from the survey that the respondents mostly own ink multifunction equipment. Among the most commonly used printer makes are Hewlett Packard, Cannon and Epson. However, the proportion of less significant makes has dropped in the last three years. The respondents mostly buy original cartridges in shops and they buy black cartridges more often than colour cartridges. The main criteria for choosing a certain cartridge are price, quality and availability. The obtained information helped me select suitable cartridges for consumers. I found that cartridges are more readily available on the market in comparison to toners. When evaluating measurable attributes (price, quality and environmental friendliness) I calculated that in most cases it pays to buy renovated cartridges, especially for the evaluated cartridge from the makes HP and Canon and for toner makes HP and Epson. Epson cartridges contain a chip which prevents their renovation which is why I would recommend the purchase of a compatible cartridge. For the Canon toner I would recommend the purchase of a compatible cartridge too. In summary of my recommendations I would advise consumers to look closely at the price, volume, quality, producer and possibility to renovate when purchasing cartridges. I would further recommend buying ink printers as it is difficult to get cartridges for laser printers. I would point out that in most cases a rule applies: the cheaper the printer the more expensive the cartridge...|$|R
40|$|The {{bioprinting}} technology {{allows the}} creation of three-dimensional (3 D) tissues in an additive manufacturing process with spatial control of cells, bioactive materials and molecules and therefore reflects the inherent complexity of native tissues to a high degree. As applied university we focus on industry-driven projects. We are developing bioprinting solutions {{in the fields of}} the cosmetic and pharma industry. The current bioprinting solution offers the following specifications: i) inkjet- and extruder-based printheads with temperature control for cell jetting and contact printing into well plates, ii) different cell-compatible printable matrices (bioinks), iii) a photopolymerization unit to crosslink bioinks at 365 nm and iv) a cell mixer to avoid cell sedimentation in the <b>print</b> <b>cartridge</b> while printing. For tissue generation alternating layers of bioink and cells are printed to produce a multi-layered 3 D tissue construct. In our aging population there is a huge demand for treatments of muscle-tendon related diseases. In an industry research project we are developing an all-in-one solution to produce and analyse printed in vitro muscle-tendon tissues in a customized well plate. Two posts in each well of the well plate will serve as anchor points to build muscle/tendon tissues. First, monocultures of primary human myoblasts and primary rat tenocytes were printed separately in a dumbbell-shape around the posts. After cell differentiation the myoblasts were stained positive for myosin heavy chain (MHC) and myotubes developed and for tendon the characteristic collagen I-distribution around the cell nuclei was detected. The printed muscle tissue is contracting on electrical stimulation and shows physiological functionality. The integration of electrodes in the well plates will allow electrical stimulation and subsequent read-out in the well plate. Nephrotoxicity is a major cause for effective drugs not being marketed. In a precompetitive research project we are reproducing parts of the nephron the so called proximal tubulus. In preliminary experiments we printed the proximal tubule of the kidney seeded with proximal tubule epithelial cells to cultivate them under physiological flow conditions. The development of standardized 3 D in vitro tissue models combined with read-outs is a prerequisite for the future success of 3 D tissues in substance testing and medicine in general.

30|$|A {{portable}} {{test strip}} reader {{that runs on}} a tablet PC and equipped with a Wi-Fi module was successfully developed in this study. This reader has a lighter weight than those of existing detection readers. It can run for long durations without an alternating current (AC) power supply, making it suitable for outdoor detection. Given the favorable price of the CMOS sensor, the cost of our reader is also tremendously low, making it an even practical device. The 3 D <b>printed</b> <b>cartridge</b> of the LFIA is highly suitable for our reader, and 3 D printing technology {{can be used to}} design different formats. The barcode printed on the strip contains the patient information and the detection type, thereby avoiding incorrect detections.

50|$|In {{the thermal}} inkjet process, the <b>print</b> <b>cartridges</b> {{consist of a}} series of tiny chambers, each {{containing}} a heater, all of which are constructed by photolithography. To eject a droplet from each chamber, a pulse of current is passed through the heating element causing a rapid vaporization of the ink in the chamber and forming a bubble, which causes a large pressure increase, propelling a droplet of ink onto the paper (hence Canon's trade name of Bubble Jet). The ink's surface tension, as well as the condensation and resultant contraction of the vapor bubble, pulls a further charge of ink into the chamber through a narrow channel attached to an ink reservoir. The inks involved are usually water-based and use either pigments or dyes as the colorant. The inks must have a volatile component to form the vapor bubble; otherwise droplet ejection cannot occur. As no special materials are required, the print head is generally cheaper to produce than in other inkjet technologies.|$|R

40|$|Cherokees suffer disproportionately from diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, {{obesity and}} {{some forms of}} cancer, i. e. lung cancer, as {{compared}} to the general U. S. population. Cherokee Nation has long recognized the value of health information and its impact on health outcomes. When patients are wellinformed, participate in decisions, and communicate openly with their doctor and other health professionals, they adhere to their therapy more faithfully and help make health care more effective. This therapeutic alliance is possible in the Cherokee service population; however, there are several barriers that remain before this relationship can be realized. Due to the remoteness of many tribal communities, individuals are geographically isolated from conventional public information sources. Additionally, telecommunications and network resources are simply unavailable within many of these rural communities. Advanced telecommunication services that do exist are difficult and costly to obtain. Most Cherokees cannot afford to purchase and maintain a personal computer in their household, much less finance monthly Internet services. The proposed Cherokee Health Information Network (C. H. I. N.) or electronic access to health information project will help alleviate these barriers. Cherokee Health Information Network (C. H. I. N.) will consist of a web site and work stations linked to internet at each community center in surrounding Cherokee communities. This web site will be easy to access and it will offer links to sites such as, Medline Plus, clinicaltrials. gov, PubMed, phpartners. org, and additional National Library of Medicine databases. This project will also furnish at each site a laser printer, printing supplies such as <b>print</b> <b>cartridges</b> and paper, so clients can print and retain information. Once the project workstations and web site are operational, our project partner and resource library staff (OUHSC-Tulsa Library) will provide user training at the community meetings on how to access and utilize the electronic health information. The project will be evaluated as soon as it becomes operational by using PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Assess) methodology. Various tools will be used to evaluate the project, such as Web tracker to assess the usage, quarterly review and analysis of a visitors log count, analysis of customer surveys and informal feed back from clients during community meetings. Improvements in the content, accessibility, links and training module will be made based on project evaluation throughout the project. This project is supported under contract no.

In this paper, {{we focus on the}} interaction between a manufacturer's reverse channel choice to collect postconsumer goods and the strategic product pricing decisions in the forward channel when retailing is competitive. To this end, we model a direct product collection system, in which the manufacturer collects used products directly from the consumers (e. g., <b>print</b> and copy <b>cartridges)</b> and an indirect product collection system, in which the retailers act as product return points (e. g., single-use cameras, cellular phones). We first examine how the allocation of product collection to retailers impacts their strategic behavior in the product market, and we discuss the economic trade-offs the manufacturer faces while choosing an optimal reverse channel structure. When a direct collection system is used, channel profits are driven by the impact of scale of returns on collection effort, whereas in the indirect reverse channel, supply chain profits are driven by the competitive interaction between the retailers. Subsequently, we show that the buy-back payments transfered to the retailers for postconsumer goods provide a wholesale pricing flexibility {{that can be used to}} price discriminate between retailers of different profitability. reverse logistics, product remanufacturing, supply chain coordination, distribution channels...|$|R
