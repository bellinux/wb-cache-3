40|$|The {{production}} of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) has rapidly increased {{due to their}} wide range of applications {{in the field of}} electronics, medicine, chemistry and biology. Consequently, concerns have risen about the environmental release and potential negative impact of NPs. A few reports have described the effects of TiO 2 NPs and quantum dots upon nitrogen fixing bacteria. However, the understanding of the interaction of NPs in <b>plant-microbe</b> <b>interface</b> (symbiotic association), like alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) -Sinorhizobium meliloti, is still in its infancy. Alfalfa is the world 2 Ì† 7 s most important forage crop. It grows in association with S. meliloti, which is very important in terms of nitrogen fixation and, hence, global nitrogen cycling. This research project was aimed at understanding the effect of two ENPs (CeO 2 and ZnO) on S. meliloti and alfalfa, separately, and on their symbiosis. This investigation was completed in three phases. Initially, the associated bacterium was treated, separately, with CeO 2 and ZnO NPs. Ten nm CeO 2 and ZnO NPs were exposed towards S. meliloti at 10, 31, 62. 5, 125, and 250 mg/l in liquid Yeast Mannitol Broth (YMB). Toxicological parameters evaluated included UV/Vis measurement of minimum inhibitory concentration, disk diffusion tests, and dynamic growth. Advanced scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were utilized to determine the spatial distribution of NPs and macromolecule changes in bacterial cells, respectively. Results indicate that ZnO NPs were more toxic than CeO 2 NPs in terms of inhibition of dynamic growth and viable cells counts. STEM images revealed that CeO 2 and ZnO NPs were found on bacterial cell surfaces and ZnO NPs were internalized into the periplasmic space of the cells. FTIR spectra showed changes in protein and polysaccharide structures of extra cellular polymeric substances present in bacterial cell walls treated with both NPs. The growth data showed a bacteriostatic effect of CeO 2 NPs, whereas ZnO NPs was bactericidal to S. meliloti. Overall, ZnO NPs were found to be more toxic than CeO 2 NPs to S. meliloti. In phase II, the alfalfa plant in association with S. meliloti, were cultivated for 30 d in soil treated with ZnO NPs, ionic (ZnCl 2) and bulk ZnO, concentrations ranging from 0 (control) - 750 mg kg - 1. Plant growth, Zn bioaccumulation, dry biomass, leaf area, total protein, and catalase (CAT) activity were measured. Results showed 50...|$|E
