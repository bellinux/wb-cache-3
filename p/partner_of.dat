40|$|This {{exploratory}} study investigates the experience <b>of</b> <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> women {{at high risk}} of developing breast/ovarian cancer and reports on the partners' views concerning their relationship, communication, future planning, children and childbearing, involvement in decision-making regarding screening and prophylactic measures, and information and support needs. In-depth interviews were conducted with 15 <b>partners.</b> <b>Of</b> these, seven were <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> women who were BRCA 1 / 2 mutation carriers, five were <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> women with unknown mutation status, and three were <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> women who were non-carriers. None of the women had a previous diagnosis of breast or ovarian cancer. <b>Partners</b> <b>of</b> carriers and women with unknown mutation status were found to be more distressed than <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> non-carriers, with <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> mutation carriers reporting the most difficulties. Factors associated with better adjustment and coping for partners included dealing with this situation as a team with their wife, greater involvement in decision-making, satisfaction with their supportive roles and being optimistic. Decision-making difficulties in relation to prophylactic measures, concerns about their children possibly being at increased cancer risk, as well as the need to receive information directly from health professionals and the wish to meet other partners were also discussed. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|To assess {{prevalence}} and {{risk factors for}} posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in fathers after early preeclampsia (PE) or preterm premature rupture <b>of</b> membranes (PPROM). <b>Partners</b> <b>of</b> patients hospitalized for PE or PPROM and <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> healthy controls completed PTSD (PSS-SR) and depression (BDI-II) questionnaires during pregnancy (t (1)) and 6 weeks postpartum (t (2)). 85 of the 187 eligible men participated (51 <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> patients, 34 <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> control) at t (1), and 66 men participated both time points. No {{significant differences were found}} between <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> patients and <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> controls in symptoms of PTSD and depression (t (1) : p = 0. 28 for PTSD and p = 0. 34 for depression; t (2) : p = 0. 08 for PTSD and p = 0. 31 for depression). For <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> patients, correlation between PTSD and depression sum-scores was 0. 48 (p < 0. 001) at t (1) and 0. 86 (p < 0. 001) at t (2). Within-couple correlation was low and not significant during pregnancy, but strong at postpartum (PSS-SR: r = 0. 62, p < 0. 001; BDI-II: r = 0. 59, p < 0. 001). Higher paternal age was associated with more symptoms of PTSD and depression postpartum in <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> patients. Symptoms of PTSD and depression during pregnancy predicted the occurrence of PTSD symptoms following childbirth in <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> patients. Symptoms of PTSD and depression occurred at a similar rate in <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> women with PE or PPROM and <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> healthy pregnant controls. Symptoms of PTSD and depression during pregnancy predicted the occurrence of PTSD symptoms following childbirth. Increased paternal age predicted more symptoms of PTSD and depression postpartum.

40|$|PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} (a) if {{depressive symptoms}} in <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> long-term breast cancer survivors (BCSs) could be predicted by social cognitive processing theory and (b) if <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> {{younger and older}} BCSs were differentially affected by the cancer experience.  . DESIGN: A cross-sectional, descriptive study using self-report questionnaires.  . SETTING: Indiana University in Bloomington and 97 ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group sites in the United States.  . SAMPLE: 508 <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> BCSs diagnosed three to eight {{years prior to the}} study.  . METHODS: Secondary data mediation analyses were conducted to determine if cognitive processing mediated the relationship between social constraints and depressive symptoms. Age-related differences on all scales were tested.  . MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Depressive symptoms; secondary variables included social constraints, cognitive processing (avoidance and intrusive thoughts), and potentially confounding variables.  . FINDINGS: Cognitive processing mediated the relationship between social constraints and depressive symptoms for <b>partners.</b> <b>Partners</b> <b>of</b> younger BCSs reported worse outcomes on all measures than <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> older BCSs.  . CONCLUSIONS: As predicted by the social cognitive processing theory, cognitive processing mediated the relationship between social constraints and depressive symptoms. In addition, <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> younger BCSs fared worse on social constraints, intrusive thoughts, and depressive symptoms than <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> older BCSs.  .

40|$|Background: Knowledge {{about the}} {{potential}} burden for family caregivers related {{to the care of}} patients with heart failure (HF) is limited. The aims of the study were to compare the kind and amount of care provided by <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> HF patients and <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> healthy individuals and to examine the associations between gender and the performance of caregiving tasks. Methods and Results: Caregiving tasks performed by 338 <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> HF patients were compared with those performed by 1202 <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> healthy individuals. <b>Partners</b> (age 70 +/- 9, 76 % female) of HF patients were more likely to provide personal care compared with partners (age 65 +/- 7, 66 % female) of healthy individuals after controlling for their age. However, the magnitude of the odds ratios (OR) differed by gender <b>of</b> <b>partners</b> (OR for male 6. 7; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 3. 9 - 11. 4; OR for female 3. 7; 95 % CI 2. 7 - 5. 1). <b>Partners</b> <b>of</b> HF patients were more likely to provide emotional care than <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> healthy individuals, controlling for age and gender (OR 2. 4; 95 % CI 1. 5 - 3. 6). Male <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> HF patients were more likely to provide personal care compared to female <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> HF patients (OR 1. 9 : 95 % CI 1. 1 - 3. 2). Conclusions: The care performed by <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> HF patients is above and beyond normal spousal assistance. The study underscores the crucial role of family caregivers in the care of HF patients and encourages health care providers {{to address the needs of}} both HF patients and their caregivers.

In the first six months after diagnosis, partners' GP use was similar to baseline (18 to six months before diagnosis).

40|$|Background. Genital human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) infection {{is one of}} the most common sexually transmitted diseases, and it has been identified as a significant risk factor for the development of dysplasia and cancer of the uterine cervix. The possible influence of male HPV lesions on female cervix oncogenesis has not been elucidated so far. In the present study we evaluate the male <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> women with clinical or subclinical HPV infection with particular interest in the clinical features of this infection in both partners. Methods. We examined 81 male <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> women affected with {{human papillomavirus}} infections. Condylomata acuminata were searched for by visual inspection. Subclinical lesions were searched by 5 power optical magnification lens after application of 5 % acetic acid. Results. In men we observed the following percentage of infection: 67 % <b>of</b> the <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> women affected with condylomata acuminata, 46 % <b>of</b> the <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> women affected with subclinical lesions (acetic acid positive), and 40 % <b>of</b> the <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> women with association of HPV and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
