Agnieszka Weinar (2010) notes the widening use of the term, arguing that recently, [...] "a growing body of literature succeeded in reformulating the definition, framing diaspora as almost any <b>population</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> and no longer referring to the specific context of their existence". It has even been noted that as charismatic Christianity becomes increasingly globalized, many Christians conceive of themselves as a diaspora, and form an imaginary that mimics salient features of ethnic diasporas.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Drawing {{upon the}} massive {{redevelopment}} catalyzed by the government-led urban renewal in Hong Kong {{in the past}} two decades, this research pays attention to how biased normalization of care and dependency contributes to a neoliberal regime of urban redevelopment that dictates more than 200 urban renewal projects. It examines {{the ways in which the}} regime reconfigures the daily existence of urban citizens, and moreover, the intense competition among Pearl River Delta cities. Taking a transnational perspective from below, it reveals how the denial has affected a particular <b>population</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> and more importantly, unsettled the civil society. By theorizing "carescapes" as a heuristic device, it trace the ways in which the transnational circulation of rent/capital travels across borders at the cost of care and needs. It illuminates the multiple displacements of care: the displacement of reproductive space and nested dependency relations; the displacement of urban residents to make room for the elite visitors; the displacement of citizens on a transnational scale, including both the underprivileged migrants and the elite expatriates who struggle to stay put in the liquid labor market...|$|E

40|$|What {{practices}} of (in) securitization involve {{the notions of}} border and border control in the European Union? How do these practices operate? How are they assembled? In the resulting assemblage, {{is the notion of}} borders – understood as state borders – still relevant for the control of individuals and populations moving across the frontiers of <b>the</b> EU? Drawing <b>on</b> empirical observations and with a specific focus on how border control is translated into different social universes, this article seeks to show that {{practices of}} control are routinely embedded in a practical sense that informs what controlling borders does and means. This practical sense is itself informed by different professional habitus and work routines involving deterrence and the use of force, interrogation and detention, surveillance of <b>populations</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> and <b>the</b> profiling of (un) trusted travellers. Its strength varies in relation to its shared dimension by most of the operators, and is adjusted to the materiality of borders {{as well as to the}} local contexts in which it is deployed. It activates, or does not activate, the maximal use of various control technologies (satellites, pre-registration and interoperable exchange of data between the state and private bureaucracies, biometrics identifiers, body-scanners). For understanding practices of (in) securitization, actual work routines and the specific professional ‘dispositions’ are therefore more important than any discourses actors may use to justify their activities...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to reflect some of the {{advances}} in our research on the work done by Dominican women at cantinas located in Puerto Rico and on the women’s access to the American social protection system. The fieldwork was conducted in 2014, using an ethnographic methodology. In this context, we have focused on the discourse produced by both governmental and non-governmental agents responsible for ensuring the welfare of the most vulnerable population. In particular, bearing in mind that, as a <b>population</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> subjected to situations of exploitation, these women could have access to resources related to human trafficking, we have also examined the support system for trafficking victims. Trafficking cannot be understood without reference to international regulations governed by specific ideologies and definitions about what constitutes a trafficking victim. We have therefore focused on how such regulations are put into practice on the ground. We will consider how, by constructing a «trafficking victim» category, both the regulations and their practical implementation make racialized working-class Dominican women invisible, even though they are extensively present throughout the country and can be found in labor exploitation spaces...|$|E

40|$|While {{the moving}} image and {{migration}} were both phenomena of substantial currency and effect during the twentieth century, {{in the present}} moment, {{it appears that the}} visibility of video and migration is increasingly enhanced based respectively <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sheer volume and variety of <b>populations</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> and <b>the</b> pyramiding appeal and accessibility of video. Video is a medium of time; of time contrived, manipulated, and offered in different, multilayered ways. Time no longer captured, as in the very first strips of celluloid, nor even "sampled" in bits separated by cuts; time is "framed," made to appear real but no longer indexically attached to the real time that it purportedly represents. Like cinema, it offers images moving in time—slow or fast, interrupting and integrating. Similarly, migration is an experience of time; of time as multiple, heterogeneous—the time of haste and waiting; the time of movement and stagnation; the time of memory and of an unsettling, provisional present, with its pleasures and its violence. I explore the interactions, connections and discrepancies between these two temporalities. Through several works from the video exhibition 2 MOVE, I examine three intersections between video and migration. First, both are anchored in the conceptual metaphor of movement—but a movement that cannot be taken for routine, "natural," or realist. Second, heterochrony offers temporal shelter to memories. And memories are themselves heterogeneous, multisensate, and multitemporal. Third, I probe the time of the viewing, which is the present...|$|R
40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need for a better {{understanding}} of animal migratory ecology under the influence of climate change. Most current analyses require long-term monitoring of <b>populations</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> and shorter-term approaches are needed. Here, we analysed the ecological drivers of seabird migration {{within the framework of the}} energyscape concept, which we defined as the variations in the energy requirements of an organism across geographical space as a function of environmental conditions. We compared the winter location of seabirds with their modelled energy requirements and prey fields throughout the North Atlantic. Across six winters, we tracked the migration of 94 little auks (Alle alle), a key sentinel Arctic species, between their East-Greenland breeding site and wintering areas off Newfoundland. Winter energyscapes were modelled with Niche Mapper™, a mechanistic tool which takes into account local climate and bird ecophysiology. Subsequently, we used a resource selection function to explain seabird distributions through modelled energyscapes and winter surface distribution of one of their main prey, Calanus finmarchicus. Finally, future energyscapes were calculated according to IPCC climate change scenarios. We found that little auks targeted areas with high prey densities and moderately elevated energyscapes. Predicted energyscapes for 2050 and 2095 showed a decrease in winter energy requirements under the high emission scenario, which may be beneficial if prey availability is maintained. Overall, our study demonstrates the great potential of the energyscape concept for the study of animal spatial ecology, in particular in the context of global change...|$|R

What comes to mind is a flat, unbroken plain, crisscrossed with roads and waterways transporting cargo from monocropped fields to the centers of state control. The toiling population is easily located in farmhouses, where they may be recruited for corvée labor or conscripted for military campaigns. Conversely, we are also asked to imagine designing the reverse: spaces that perfectly evade state control. Now we imagine steep, densely forested mountains divided by ravines or swamps, muddy roads inundated with rain, and a <b>population</b> always <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> taking their agricultural techniques with them, their ethnonyms, religion, and social organization forever confounding those that attempt to record them...|$|R

However, the Appeals Chamber decided that civilian departures related to artillery attacks [...] "only constituted deportation where these artillery attacks were found to have been unlawful" [...] (par. 87), and in turn [...] "reversed the Trial Chamber’s findings related to unlawful artillery attacks" [...] (par. 91) thus defeating charges of deportation entirely.|$|R

50|$|Since {{far in the}} pre-Hispanic past, Malinalco was {{considered}} a magical place, filled with gods and sorcerers. The area shows influences from the Teotihuacan culture, the Toltecs, Matlatzincas and Aztecs, but little is known of the area’s pre-Aztec history. Remains of an earlier ceremonial center exist at the summit the Cerro de los Idolos (Hill of the Idols), but this center and its associated residential zones have not been excavated. The first settlements {{in this part of}} Mexico State date back to the early post-Classic {{and the beginning of the}} late post-Classic. This was a time when many <b>populations</b> were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> in <b>the</b> highlands of Mexico, with new peoples moving south from what is now northern Mexico. The first people to arrive here were probably the Culhuas, led by a chief named Cuauhtepexpetlatzin, after this group had already settled in the Valley of Mexico. Other peoples to arrive here include the Matlazincas, the Ocuiltecos and the Otomi. By the time the Aztecs arrived, the area was dominated by the Matlazincas, who had settled earlier in the Toluca Valley by 8th century CE, then migrated here. By the mid-15th century, the Aztecs and the Matlazincas had something of an understanding. However, in 1476, the Aztecs subjected this area to their empire under the rule of Axayacatl. While Axayacatl conquered this area, it was a successor, Ahuizotl who had most of the Aztec shrines, temples and other constructions built here. including the fort and sanctuary for Aztec military elite. When the Spanish arrived, the inhabitants of Malinalco resisted the conquistadors. Andrés de Tapia was in charge of subduing the populations of Malinalco and Ocuilán. Once this was achieved, the area was organized into encomiendas. Malinalco was first under the jurisdiction of Cristobál Rodriguez de Avalos and then the Spanish Crown itself.|$|R
40|$|Europe {{is facing}} {{a new era of}} {{migration}}. During the last decades, the European migration system underwent several shifts due to different reasons. A basic observation is that general changes, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> political map for example, do not necessarily have the same consequences in European regions, even in seemingly similar contexts. The major changes started in 1990 accelerated with the enlargement of the European Union in 2004 and found its continuation by crisis-driven migration from south European countries into Western European labour markets after 2008. All of these "migration waves" have been topped by a massive inflow of refugees in 2015 creating new migratory map of Europe. Thus, important stages of contemporary and present European migration history are interpreted as indicators for a surplus in diversity, flexibility and spontaneity and will serve for formulating the hypothesis of Elusive Migration Systems as an analytical framework and a kind of hypothesis to study new features of migrants’ trajectories, which became more and more variable. Being grounded may be the wish of the majority of Europeans and, in effect, the global <b>population,</b> but being <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> voluntarily or forced, is reality for a certain number of migrants inside and heading towards Europe...|$|R
40|$|The {{consequences}} of population decline are present at different geographical scales {{and are often}} believed to be self-reinforcing. This means that population decline possibly causes changes in the living environment, which brings about more population decline. This research analysed if population decline at the neighbourhood level has an effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> probability to <b>move</b> out or within rural neighbourhoods in North-Netherlands. It was expected that a preceding decline {{of the population in}} the neighbourhood increased <b>the</b> probability to <b>move</b> out of <b>the</b> neighbourhood, but that this effect differed for categories of the population and for moves over short and long distance. Using register data and additional surveys for 2006, a multinomial logistic regression model was constructed to estimate the effects of a preceding decline of neighbourhood <b>populations</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> probability to <b>move</b> over short and long distances for different categories of the population. It was found that a preceding decline of the neighbourhood population increased <b>the</b> probability to <b>move</b> out of <b>the</b> neighbourhood.

Moreover, by calculating estimated probabilities of moving out of neighbourhoods with declining and stable populations, it was shown that the difference between actual numbers of people moving out of these two types of neighbourhoods, was small and could therefore {{take a long time to}} have serious impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> neighbourhood <b>population...</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a massive influx of Syrian {{refugees}} into Jordan since the Syrian conflict began: the official figure is over 650, 000 but the actual number {{is likely to be}} much higher (ACAPS, 2016 : 1). Only 21. 5 per cent of registered Syrian refugees are living in camps; 78. 5 per cent are in urban areas, distributed as follows: Amman (26. 4 per cent), Mafraq (23. 9 per cent), Irbid (20. 7 per cent) and Zarqa (16. 7 per cent) (ACAPS, 2016 : 2). Life in Jordan has become increasingly difficult for Syrian refugees in urban host communities: savings and opportunities for subsistence have disappeared, alongside reductions in assistance (DRC, 2016; Francis, 2015). Difficult conditions in Jordan, the prevailing sense of the protracted 2 nature of the conflict in Syria, and the belief in greater opportunities and better treatment in Europe are causing many Syrians to consider the onward journey to Europe (DRC, 2016; Hartberg, 2016; Lenner and Schmelter, 2016; Dunmore, 2015). In Jordan, 50 per cent of Syrian refugees surveyed by the Norwegian Refugee Council at the end of 2015 said that they were intending to leave because they saw no future, in large part due to inability to obtain legal work and insufficient assistance (Hartberg, 2016, p. 5). Despite the dangerous journey and new restrictive EU member state policies, 20 per cent of Syrian refugees who aimed to leave said they would try to make it to Europe (Ibid). Within <b>the</b> <b>population</b> of Syrians <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move,</b> there are distinct groups and categories (e. g. Christian Syrians, Syrian women, Syrian children, Palestinian refugees from Syria, former combatants), with varying experiences, motivations and concerns regarding onward movement to Europe.
