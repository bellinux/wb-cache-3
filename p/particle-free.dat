40|$|We {{investigate}} the fluctuating pattern {{created by a}} jet of fluid impingent upon an amphiphile-covered surface. This microscopically thin layer is initially covered with 50 Î¼m floating particles so that the layer can be visualized. A vertical jet of water located below the surface and directed upward drives a hole in this layer. The hole is <b>particle-free</b> and is surrounded by the particle-laden amphiphile region. The jet ruptures the amphiphile layer creating a <b>particle-free</b> region that is surrounded by the particle-covered surface.

The significance of such structures is not clear. The present observations suggest that <b>particle-free</b> arrays are related to those bearing glycogen and may thus be associated with anabolic functions...|$|E
40|$|Freeze-fracturing of cholesterol-rich Mycoplasma gallisepticum {{membranes}} from cells {{grown in}} a medium containing horse serum revealed <b>particle-free</b> patches. The patches appeared in cells quenched from either 4 or 37 degrees C. <b>Particle-free</b> patches also occurred in membranes of cells grown in a serum-free medium supplemented with egg-phosphatidylcholine but not in membranes of cells grown with dioleoylphosphatidylcholine. The appearance of <b>particle-free</b> patches was attributed {{to the presence of}} disaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecules in M. gallisepticum membranes, which were synthesized by the insertion of a saturated fatty acid at position 2 of lysophosphatidylcholine derived from exogenous PC present in the growth medium. Consequences of the synthesis of the disaturated PC also included a decrease in osmotic fragility and the ability of the cells to be permeated by K+. Electron paramagnetic resonance and fluorescence polarization measurements revealed that the fluidity of the lipid domain in the protein-rich M. gallisepticum membranes was almost identical to that of an aqueous dispersion of M. gallisepticum membrane lipids. Furthermore, the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the membranes were single-component spectra showing no indication of immobilized regions. The possibility that the osmotic resistance of M. gallisepticum cells is associated with the <b>particle-free</b> patches rather than with a restricted membrane fluidity caused by membrane proteins is discussed...|$|E
40|$|When a <b>particle-free</b> {{supernatant}} fraction from rat liver was incubated at 37 degrees C with mitochondria and oleate, {{some of the}} enzyme phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAP), initially present in the <b>particle-free</b> supernatant, was recovered, after the incubation, bound to mitochondria. This translocation of PAP from cytosol to mitochondria was stimulated by oleate or palmitate {{in a similar fashion}} to the stimulation of translocation of PAP to endoplasmic reticulum [Martin-Sanz, Hopewell & Brindley (1984) FEBS Lett. 175, 284 - 288]. Translocation of PAP from <b>particle-free</b> supernatant to a partially purified mitochondrial-outer-membrane preparation was also stimulated by oleate. More PAP was bound to a mitochondrial-outer-membrane fraction washed in 0. 5 M-NaCl before resuspension in sucrose than to a sucrose-washed mitochondrial-outer-membrane preparation. In contrast, washing of microsomal membranes in 0. 5 M-NaCl did not enhance the binding of PAP to these membranes. PAP also binds to phosphatidate-loaded mitochondria or microsomes (microsomal fractions). In the experimental system employed, more PAP bound to mitochondria loaded with phosphatidate than to microsomes loaded with phosphatidate. The results are discussed in relation to the role of mitochondrial phosphatidate in liver lipid metabolism...|$|E
40|$|The freeze-fracture {{technique}} {{was used to}} examine the membranes of the photoreceptors of mice and frogs. <b>Particle-free</b> patches were found in the plasma membrane and basal disk membranes of the outer segments of both mice and frogs housed at room temperature, but not in frogs kept in a cold room. These patches were shown not to be artifacts of cryoprotection or fixation, and they persisted when fresh isolated outer segments were frozen by an ultrarapid method. They were also found to persist in mouse rods when retinas were incubated and subsequently fixed at temperatures up to 80 ~ Cholesterol was implicated as a significant component of the patches by the observation that, in the outer segments, pits, induced by treatment with the sterol-specific polyene antibiotic filipin, were present in and confined to the <b>particle-free</b> patches. That these lesions are not inherently limited to <b>particle-free</b> membrane areas was evident in the apical plasma membrane of the photoreceptor inner segments, where particles and pits were intermixed.

40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} numerical {{investigation of the}} solidification process during gravity casting of functionally graded materials (FGMs) is conducted. Focus is placed on understanding the interplay between the freezing front dynamics and particle transport during solidification. Transparent model experiments were performed in a rectangular ingot using pure water and succinonitrile (SCN) as the matrix and glass beads as the particle phase. The time evolutions of local particle volume fractions were measured in situ by bifurcated fiber optical probes working in the reflection mode. The effects of important processing parameters were explored. It is found that there exists a <b>particle-free</b> zone in the top portion of the solidified ingot, followed by a graded particle distri-bution region towards the bottom. Higher superheat results in slower solidification and hence a thicker <b>particle-free</b> zone and a higher particle concentration near the bottom. The higher initial particle volume fraction leads to a thinner <b>particle-free</b> region. Lower cooling temperatures suppress particle settling. A one-dimensional multiphase solidifica-tion model was also developed, and the model equations were solved numerically using a fixed-grid, finite-volume method. The model was then validated against the experimental results and subsequently used {{as a tool for}} efficient computational prototyping of an Al/SiC FGM...|$|E
40|$|Myoblast fusion {{has been}} studied in {{cultures}} of chick embryonic muscle utilizing ultrastructural techniques. The multinucleated muscle cells (myotubes) are generated by the fusion of two plasma membranes from adjacent cells, apparently by forming a single bilayer that is particle- free in freeze-fracture replicas. This single bilayer subsequently collapses, and cytoplasmic continuity is established between the cells. The fusion between the two plasma membranes appears to take place primarily within <b>particle-free</b> domains (probably phospholipid enriched), and cytoplasmic unilamellar, <b>particle-free</b> vesicles are occasionally associated with these regions. These vesicles structurally resemble phospholipid vesicles (liposomes). They are present in normal myoblasts, but they are absent in certain fusion-arrested myoblast popluations, such as those treated with either 5 -bromo-deoxyuridine (BUdR), cycloheximide (CHX), or pospholipase C (PLC). The unilamellar, <b>particle-free</b> vesicles are present {{in close proximity to}} the plasma membranes, and physical contact is observed frequently between the vesicle membrane and the plasma membrane. The regions of vesicle membrane-plasma membrane interaction are characteristically free of intramembrane particles. A model for myoblast fusion is presented that is based onan interpretation of these observations. This model suggests that the cytoplasmic vesicles initiate the generation of particle- depleted membrane domains, both being essential components in the fusion process...|$|E

40|$|Freeze-fracture {{electron}} microscopy reveals constant and widespread presence of membrane particles on the fracture faces of frozen myelin. In unfixed myelin frozen shortly after dissection {{the distribution of}} the particles is uniform. In glutaraldehyde-fixed and/or glycerol-impregnated myelin the particles frequently occupy a network interspersed with circumscribed <b>particle-free</b> areas of variable dimension. In these membranes the network of particles is propagated radially across many lamellae. Particle-rich areas are closely apposed and contrast with frequent delamination of adjacent <b>particle-free</b> regions. We propose that, as in other plasma membranes, the particles of myelin represent protein-containing structures intercalated across the hydrophobic matrix of a membrane with bilayer organization. Our results indicate that these structures contain sites which mutually interact at the surface of apposed membranes and may be important in maintaining the organizational integrity of myelin...|$|E
40|$|We {{synthesize}} {{and investigate}} a lead- and <b>particle-free</b> metal-organic ink based on silver salts and various glass components {{to be used}} for the front side metallization of crystalline silicon solar cells. This novel metallization ink can be considered as a low-temperature sintering ink, as the silver salt reduces and builds a seed-layer layer at 450 - 480 oC. It can locally open the silicon nitride layer as well as form contact to the phosphorous-doped emitter at the surface. Due to the absence of particles in the ink, aerosol or ink jet printing are the ideal deposition technologies, as clogging of the printer nozzles is avoided. Additionally, as another advantage of <b>particle-free</b> inks, no aggregation occurs, allowing long-term stability and homogeneity. For a sufficient conductivity of the contact lines, plating of nickel and copper is investigated as an additional option for cost reduction. A final stable silver-based <b>particle-free</b> ink was developed consisting of 26 wt% metal content including silver-, bismuth-, and zinc-neodecanoate. Both the bismuth and zinc components are responsible for etching the ARC SiNx layer and have been analyzed separately for ink stability, as well as etching parameters in order to reach the optimum component ratio. The solvents used were xylol and N-Methyl- 2 -pyrrolidon to ensure solubility of the silver-neodecanoic in the solution as well as enable good printability of the ink...|$|E

The various fractions were solubilized in buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and analyzed for protein and glycoprotein components by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The major glycoprotein components of the postnuclear supernatant fraction were found mainly associated with the enriched fraction of secondary granules and, to a lesser extent, with the membrane-rich fraction. No major glycoprotein components were visible in the polypeptide electrophoretic patterns of the primary granule fraction or of the <b>particle-free</b> cell supernate. Attempts at separation of guinea pig granules by zonal sucrose density gradient centrifugation were only partially successful. Data supporting a species differenc...|$|E

The sarcolemma of atrial and atrioventricular nodal myocytes was considerably more reactive to sterol probes than the sarcolemma of general ventricular myocytes. Atrial myocyte sarcolemma was also more reactive than previously reported in rat atrial myocytes. <b>Particle-free</b> regions of annular nexuses were consistently unreactive with all combinations of sterol probes whereas much smaller <b>particle-free</b> regions of macular nexuses and desmosomes were reactive with the same probes.

40|$|Numerical {{modeling}} {{was performed}} to study the submicron particle dynamics in a confined flow field containing a rotating disk, temperature gradient, and various inlet gas flow rates. The Lagrangian model was employed to compute particle trajectories under the temperature gradient, disk rotation speed, and inlet gas flow rate effects. The trajectories of particles with diameters of 1 mum, 0. 1 mum, and 0. 01 mum were examined in this study. When the inlet gas temperature was {{lower than that of}} the disk, <b>particle-free</b> zones were created due to upward thermophoretic force for 1 mum and 0. 1 mum particles. Disk rotation was found to depress the size of the <b>particle-free</b> zone. Particle deposition onto the disk for 0. 01 mum particles was possible because of the Brownian motion effect. A detailed evaluation of the <b>particle-free</b> zone size {{as a function of the}} temperature gradient, disk rotation speed, and inlet gas flow rate was performed. When the inlet gas temperature was higher than the disk temperature, particle deposition onto the disk was enhanced due to the downward thermophoretic force for 1 mum and 0. 1 mum particles. Disk rotation was found to increase the deposition rate. For 0. 01 mum particles, Brownian motion was more important than thermophoretic force in controlling particle behavior. The particle deposition rates as a function of the temperature gradient, disk rotation speed, and inlet gas flow rate were performed...|$|E
40|$|The {{extinction}} coefficient of ambient aerosol particles {{was measured using}} a multiple transverse cell (White Cell) with an effective path length of 100 m. Measurements were performed at seven fixed wavelengths in the visible region using a white light source and an interference filter set with 2 nm bandwidth and center wavelengths of 405. 5, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, and 692. 5 nm. The total air flow in the system was 16. 7 1 /min; {{the volume of the}} chamber is close to 10 liters.

Overall, the micro-fluidized bed provided a mixing effectiveness and energetic efficiency of mixing that were up to three times greater than those of a <b>particle-free</b> channel of the same dimensions. The mixing performance is strongly affected by specific power input and bed voidage.

At low electrolyte concentration, the silica particles remain dispersed, with the turbulence intensity of the suspension flow comparable with that of the <b>particle-free</b> flow. At high electrolyte concentration, increased particle-particle interaction leads to the formation of particle aggregates which support turbulence augmentation over a critical Reynolds number range.

40|$|The {{membranes}} of Limulus (horseshoe crab) sperm {{were examined}} {{before and during}} the acrosomal reaction by using the technique of freeze- fracturing and thin sectioning. We focused on three areas. First, we examined stages in the fusion of the acrosomal vacuole with the cell surface. Fusion takes place in a <b>particle-free</b> zone which is surrounded by a circlet of particles on the P face of the plasma membrane and an underlying circlet of particles on the P face of the acrosomal vauole membrane. These circlets of particles are present before induction. Up to nine focal points of fusion occur within the <b>particle-free</b> zone. Second, we describe a system of fine filaments, each 30 A in diameter, which lies between the acrosomal vacuole and the plasma membrane. These filaments change their orientation as the vacuole opens, a process that takes place in less than 50 ms. Membrane particles seen on the P face of the acrosomal vacuole membrane change their orientation {{at the same time and}} in the same way as do the filaments, thus indicating that the membrane particles and filaments are probably connected. Third, we examined the source and the point of fusion of new membrane needed to cover the acrosomal process. This new membrane is almost certainly derived from the outer nuclear envelope and appears to insert into the plasma membrane in a <b>particle-free</b> area adjacent to an area rich in particles. The latter is the region where the particles are probably connected to the cytoplasmic filaments.

When the <b>particle-free</b> supernatant was incubated with various combinations of Mg 2 +, ATP, cyclic AMP and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase this failed to alter significantly phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activity under the conditions employed. The incubation of hepatocytes in monolayer culture with 0. 5 mM- 8 -(4 -chlorophenylthio) adenosine 3 ', 5 '-monophosphate increased the total activity of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase as measured in vitro. This also decreased {{the proportion of the}} phosphohydrolase that was associated with the membrane fraction of the cells and increased that in the cytosolic fraction. Adding 1 mM-oleate to the hepatocytes promoted the translocation of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase from the cytosol to the membrane-associated compartment.

These results are discussed in relation to the interaction of hormonal balance and substrate supply in controlling the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and triacylglycerol in the liver in stress and in diabetes.
