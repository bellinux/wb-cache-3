5|$|A {{number of}} songs written by Mendelssohn's sister Fanny {{originally}} appeared under her brother's name; {{this may have}} been <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prejudice of the family, and partly to her own retiring nature.|$|E
5|$|Before The 3rd Birthdays {{release in}} 2010, both Yoshinori Kitase and Tetsuya Nomura {{discussed}} the re-release of Parasite Eve and Parasite Eve II. The release {{was being held}} up <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> series rights being co-owned with Hideaki Sena.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, the {{domestic}} and international demand for durian in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region has increased significantly, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> increasing affluence of Asia.|$|E
50|$|The {{preceding}} {{budget of}} the Labour Party in March was only <b>partly</b> enacted <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> calling of the election.|$|R
50|$|Fired: Troy McClain - for {{sometimes}} using unethical {{business practices}} throughout {{the duration of}} the interview process, and <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> lacking <b>the</b> education of the other two contestants.|$|R
50|$|The life of Joan of Arc {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{documented}} of her era. This is especially remarkable when one considers that she was not an aristocrat but rather a peasant girl. This fact is <b>due</b> <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trial record, and <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> also <b>to</b> <b>the</b> records of the later appeal of her case after the war when the trial was investigated and its verdict overturned.|$|R
5|$|Today, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{foresight}} {{or business}} acumen of Ralph Hawkes, the company controls the copyrights in major 20th-century music. It also publishes many prominent contemporary composers and the company's New York branch has developed its own catalogue emphasising {{the works of}} American composers.|$|E
5|$|David Villa {{ended the}} season with a large amount of his {{appearances}} coming from the bench, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recovery time of his previous injury. Despite this, he was still able to amass 16 goals in 39 appearances while his performances earned him a spot in Spain's 2013 Confederations Cup squad.|$|E
5|$|Hurricanes (or their remnants) {{occasionally}} track {{through the}} area in late summer and early fall, but are often weak {{by the time they}} reach Washington, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city's inland location. Flooding of the Potomac River, however, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, has been known to cause extensive property damage in the neighborhood of Georgetown.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of the 1939-40 season the {{reserves}} played two Football Combination games and one Southern League game before football was <b>partly</b> suspended <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outbreak of the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|Spencer was a trombonist who, {{after playing}} in the band that he led from 1946 to 1949, gave up playing entirely, <b>due</b> <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> a heart murmur, <b>due</b> <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hard {{economics}} of big bands in {{that began in the}} late 1940s, and <b>due</b> <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band's record label, Black & White Records, which went out of business in October 1949.|$|R
50|$|There {{have also}} been {{concerns}} over potential eye pain caused by users new to Glass. These concerns were validated by Google's optometry advisor Dr. Eli Peli of Harvard, though he later <b>partly</b> backtracked <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> controversy which ensued from his remarks.|$|R
5|$|In 1890, the Eugene Guard {{became a}} daily newspaper. Charles H. Fisher {{took over the}} paper in 1907 and {{published}} it until 1912 when E. J. Finneran purchased the paper. Finneran bankrupted the newspaper in 1916, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> purchase of a perfecting press that proved too expensive for such a small newspaper. The University of Oregon's journalism school briefly ran the paper during the receivership {{under the guidance of}} Eric W. Allen.|$|E
5|$|Leith {{spent seven}} months of {{recording}} and writing and worked with Bryon Jones, James Roche and Ross Fraser. Initially, he wanted the album {{to be released in}} March, but it was pushed back to August, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prolonged success of The Winner's Journey and partly because of the large amount of songs they had to cull.|$|E
5|$|Messiaen's {{music has}} been {{described}} as outside the western musical tradition, although growing out of that tradition and being influenced by it. Much of his output denies the western conventions of forward motion, development and diatonic harmonic resolution. This is <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> symmetries of his technique—for instance the modes of limited transposition do not admit the conventional cadences found in western classical music.|$|E
5000|$|Glasgow's {{population}} {{peaked in}} 1931 at 1,088,000, and for over 40 years remained over 1 million. However, in the 1960s <b>the</b> population started <b>to</b> decline, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> relocation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] "new towns" [...] in clearings of the poverty-stricken inner city areas like the Gorbals. In addition, successive boundary changes reduced the official city boundaries (and hence its official population) making direct comparisons difficult {{as the city}} expands beyond the local council boundaries.|$|R
50|$|Garibaldi travels <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Drazi homeworld <b>to</b> {{investigate}} {{attacks on}} Alliance shipping lanes. <b>Partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> his drinking, <b>the</b> assignment {{does not go}} smoothly.|$|R
50|$|The {{solution}} in another trial, {{held at the}} Sibiu court, was that the charges were dropped, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> lack of evidence for some charges (<b>the</b> prosecutors refused <b>to</b> show authorization for performing the taps, considering it a state secret, so evidence was dropped) and <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> exceeding <b>the</b> statute of limitations corresponding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> charges.|$|R
5|$|Salford {{is covered}} by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford, and the Church of England Diocese of Manchester. During the mid-19th century, there was an influx of Irish people into the Salford area, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Great Hunger in Ireland. In 1848, Salford Roman Catholic Cathedral was consecrated, {{reflecting}} Salford's large Irish-born community at the time.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the days}} of the stage road {{avalanches}} and rockfalls often forced closures of the highway, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> massive disturbance of the land during the road's construction. No attempt was made to remedy this until shortly after the automobile road was built. In the 1930s, as a relief project during the Great Depression, a crew from the Civilian Conservation Corps replanted the slopes around Independence, by then abandoned for two decades.|$|E
5|$|The Moon has an {{exceptionally}} low albedo, {{giving it a}} reflectance that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt. Despite this, it is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun. This is <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brightness enhancement of the opposition effect; at quarter phase, the Moon is only one-tenth as bright, rather than half as bright, as at full moon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, what {{a monster}} you make him out!" [...] And Rosier faced the Countess, who advanced, {{in front of}} Pansy, with an {{animation}} <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> perhaps <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that she perceived her sister-in-law {{to be engaged in}} conversation with a very pretty young man.|$|R
50|$|<b>Partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> this ambiguity, <b>the</b> Terminologia Anatomica {{recommends}} {{using the}} term basal nuclei instead of basal ganglia; however, this usage has not been generally adopted.|$|R
50|$|The Grenadiers resurfaced in the G.I. Joe series {{published}} by Devil's Due Publishing, where {{they continued to}} be in service of Destro. The Grenadiers have gained a new second in command, Mistress Armada. This is <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> that <b>the</b> Destro (at that time) they know is actually an impersonator and needs a talented person <b>to</b> lead <b>the</b> troops.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} L7 albums, Slap-Happy {{features more}} varied and slower-paced songs, {{some of which}} borrowing elements from other genres like hip hop. Upon release, the album received generally mixed reviews from music critics and suffered dismal sales <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poor distribution and support by Bong Load. Some critics found the album predictable and too similar to previous L7 albums, but others highlighted certain songs for their nifty musical style.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the storm, the JMA issued 99typhoon bulletins, warning {{residents}} about Mireille. There were 236warnings {{related to}} storm surge, high winds, waves, and flooding. In Hiroshima, most residents {{were aware of}} the approaching storm, about 70% of residents did not expect significant effects. In general, residents were unprepared for the storm, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lack of recent storms. Transportation in Japan was disrupted after 480domestic flights cancelled, stranding 58,000individuals, and road, rail, and ferry traffic was halted. In Hokkaido, 207schools were closed due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|French Sudan {{originally}} {{formed as}} a set of military outposts {{as an extension of the}} French colony in Senegal. Though the area offered France little economic or strategic gain, the military effectively advocated greater conquest in the region. This was partly due to a fascination with the great empires, such as the Mali Empire and the Songhay Empire that rose to prominence in the area, and <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> promotional opportunities that military conquest offered for French military personnel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{location}} of <b>the</b> circuit, areas around turns 1, 8 and 14 have been sinking, and therefore <b>the</b> circuit had <b>to</b> be inspected before the 2011 event took place.|$|R
30|$|It {{is known}} that motion has a {{considerable}} effect {{not only on the}} CTP parameters, but also on the SUV. The observed lack of correlations between the perfusion and metabolism parameters in the majority of lesions could <b>partly</b> be <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> absence of motion correction of the PET images in our study.|$|R
3000|$|... [20], where TBRs {{were reduced}} by 50 %, {{competition}} was less complete for QE and bivQ, indicating elevated unspecific binding in vivo; the reasons of which {{remain to be}} identified. However, this might <b>partly</b> be <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower initial TBR of dQ-MG- 754 of around 4 (compared to[*]>[*] 6 for QE and bivQ).|$|R
5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This is <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive {{the same amount of}} nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that two billion cases of gastroenteritis resulted in 1.3million deaths globally in 2015. Children {{and those in the}} developing world are most commonly affected. As of 2011, in those below age five, there were about 1.7billion cases resulting in about 700,000 deaths. In the developing world children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year. It is less common in adults, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of immunity.|$|E
5|$|Młynarczyk, Boniek and Żmuda {{had their}} bans {{cancelled}} early. Żmuda and Młynarczyk returned in the 1–0 home win over East Germany on 2 May 1981, and Boniek was reinstated four months later. The players' recall was <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> efforts of Kulesza's replacement, Antoni Piechniczek, {{to secure their}} return. According to Majchrzak, Boniek and Żmuda apologised for their actions before the General Committee for Physical Culture and Sport of the Polish People's Republic, the PZPN's governing body, but kept this from Terlecki, who appealed to have his ban lifted several times, but to no avail.|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the degree of}} {{urbanization}} is not a significant predictor for job search intensity, which may <b>partly</b> be <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that the maximum set of NUTS 1 region dummies (whose estimated coefficients are not reported {{for the sake of}} space) already capture a great part of the regional environment.|$|R
25|$|In 1850, FitzRoy {{retired from}} active service, <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> ill health. <b>The</b> {{following}} year, in 1851, {{he was elected}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Royal Society {{with the support of}} 13 fellows, including Charles Darwin.|$|R
30|$|The Doppler {{recordings}} demonstrated diastolic dysfunction at spontaneous heart rate, and 2 D echocardiography showed reduced EF {{at increased}} heart rates during hypothermia. These {{findings indicate that}} interpretation of echocardiographic assessments of cardiac function is more complicated in hypothermic patients. The echocardiographic findings may at least <b>partly</b> be <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hypothermia itself and will be reversed during rewarming.|$|R
