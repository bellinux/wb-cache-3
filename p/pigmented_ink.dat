40|$|Digital textile {{printing}} is over-taking the printing industry with eco-friendly processes {{and ability to}} produce short runs. With its rapid growth, {{there is a constant}} need to reproduce consistent colors throughout different print runs and crucial for these colors to perform well and up hold under certain conditions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to research the colorfastness digitally printed reactive and <b>pigment</b> <b>inks</b> printed on cotton fabrics. Fabric swatches printed using the reactive and <b>pigment</b> <b>inks</b> were tested according to the AATCC standards for laundering, crocking, light, and perspiration. The digital {{textile printing}} industry has slowly started transitioning from printing with reactive <b>inks</b> to primarily <b>pigment</b> <b>inks.</b> Printing with <b>pigment</b> <b>inks</b> is more cost effective and cheaper than reactive inks and has had a large impact on the printing industry. While reactive inks are printed on natural fibers, such as cotton and silk <b>pigment</b> <b>inks,</b> have the ability to be printed on natural and synthetic fibers. To test the textiles, a Mimaki TX 2 1600 digital textile printer was used to print the reactive ink samples while an outside printing company was used to print the <b>pigment</b> <b>ink</b> samples. One hundred and twenty-eight test samples sizes 2 ”x 6 ”printed with a red, blue, and green geometric pattern were tested. Both the pigment and reactive samples were testing according to the AATCC standards for colorfastness to laundering, crocking, light, and perspiration. Using a spectrophotometer, the samples were tested and the CIELAB color and ΔE* color change were obtained. The samples were also tested using the AATCC gray scale and 9 -step chromatic transference scale. Using the Wilcoxin rank sum test the pigment and reactive samples were compared to record any statistical significance in color change. The results revealed that the colors printed using <b>pigment</b> <b>inks</b> perform better than reactive <b>inks.</b> <b>Pigment</b> <b>inks</b> experienced much less color loss than the reactive inks in laundering, crocking, and perspiration. Light had little to no impact on the color of both the reactive and pigment samples. Evaluating the reactive and <b>pigments</b> <b>ink</b> types and their colorfastness benefits academia and the industry.

To overcome this problem, we use the fact that the black <b>pigmented</b> <b>ink</b> absorbs light in the infrared domain, whereas cyan, magenta, and yellow inks do not. Therefore, with reflection spectra measurements spanning both the visible and infrared domain, it is possible to accurately deduce the black ink coverage.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{paper and}} ink interactions related to inkjet printing. The {{main purpose of}} this work was to gain a deeper understanding in which parameters control the flow of ink into papers and how the ink interacts with the paper surface. The overall objective was to find key parameters to optimize the print quality in inkjet printing. Characterization of paper-surfaces in terms of porosity, surface roughness and surface energy was made. Objective and subjective measurements were used for print quality evaluation. Light microscopy imaging and SEM was used to see how ink interacts with the paper surface in a printed image. A high speed camera was used to study the absorption of picolitre sized inkjet droplets into fine papers. An initial study {{on the effect of}} paper properties on print quality was made. Result indicated that there were small differences in print quality for pilot papers with different composition (in a specific parameter window) and the commercial paper COLORLOK® reproduced a noticeable high colour gamut compared to the other samples. Research was made to see how surface fixation can affect the print quality for printouts made with <b>pigmented</b> <b>ink.</b> Surface fixation promotes retention of the pigmented colorant in the outermost surface layer of the paper and has been denoted “colorant fixation” in this thesis. It was shown that applying colorant fixation onto a paper surface before printing can increase the detail reproduction in a printed image. Different concentrations of calcium chloride were applied onto the paper surface on fullscale produced non-commercial papers. Test printing was made with a SoHo (Small office/Home office) printer using <b>pigmented</b> <b>ink</b> and results showed that using calcium chloride as surface treatment can lead to aggregation of pigments at the surface resulting in a higher detail reproduction. Fast absorption of the carrier liquid into the paper and fast fixation of colourants on the surface is important in inkjet printing to avoid colour to colour bleeding. These demands will be more pronounced when the printing speed increases. It is important to understand which parameters affect the absorption process to be able to control the mechanisms and to optimize the print quality. A study of absorption of picolitre size inkjet droplets into fine paper was made in this work. Theoretical equations describing fluid absorption into capillaries were tested and compared with experimental results. The result showed that the time dependence in the Lucas-Washburn (L-W) equation fits fairly well to data whereas the L-W equation overestimates the penetration depth. The results are directly applicable to paper and printing industry and {{can be used as a}} base for future studies of absorption of picolitre sized droplets into porous materials and for studies of aggregation of colloidal particles on surfaces.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{emulsification}} process of lithographic ink and water was conducted to investigate methods for determining the water content of lithographic ink and water emulsions. Experiments using infra-red spectroscopy {{and analysis of the}} hydroxyl and carbonyl absorption bands revealed several variables which must be considered when attempting to use infra-red spectroscopic methods for the determination of the water content of ink emulsions. These factors include the choice of pigment, (either transparent or opaque), the type of cell medium, and methods for dispersing added water into an ink. The initial problem encountered was a lack of reproducibility when attempting to construct a calibration system. The carbonyl absorption band at 1745 cm^- 1 was shown to vary with each sample of emulsion. The intensity of the hydroxyl absorption band at 1645 cm^- 1 was discovered to be erratic between differing samples of ink and water emulsions. This resulted in hydroxyl contents which appeared to be inconsistent with known concentrations of water. The simulation of 2 ̆ 2 on-press 2 ̆ 2 emulsification, as it occurs in the lithographic process on an offset press, is a very important factor. The importance of added water attaining the internal phase of the lithographic emulsion is the prime criterion for valid and reproducible data obtained from infra-red spectroscopic analysis. This is accomplished by applying sufficient forces to generate an adequate rate of shear on the ink as added water is introduced into the emulsification process. The two modes of vibration of a water molecule were studied utilizing data obtained from infra-red spectra. The O-H stretching mode exhibited at 3400 cm^- 1 proved to be more sensitive to changes in water content of an ink than the bending mode exhibited at 1645 cm^- 1. Valid data used to construct a calibration system for water content determination of lithographic emulsions relies on the elimination of any moisture contamination of the cell medium used in the optics system of an infra-red spectrophotometer. Likewise, use of a transparent <b>pigmented</b> <b>ink</b> yields a continuous spectra. An opaque <b>pigmented</b> <b>ink</b> causes excessive light scattering resulting in off-scale deflections of absorption bands. Present methods of laboratory simulation of the emulsification of water into an ink were investigated to determine the optimum system which would yield stable ink and water emulsions in which the added water would assume the internal phase of the lithographic emulsion. Factors such as the rate of shear and time of dispersion were studied and found to significantly influence the formation of stable lithographic emulsions. Finally, the behavior of added water on the tack of an ink was also investigated. The tack values of a 2 ̆ 2 dry 2 ̆ 2 ink were closely monitored for extended periods of time. Immediate changes in tack were noted and recorded upon the addition of water. The addition of water to an ink in which the tack had apparently stabilized, effectively lowered the tack to the point where a homogeneous, stable emulsion was possible...|$|E
40|$|The Symposium’s theme linking {{past actions}} to future creations implies a linear and {{sequential}} correspondence between them - one precedes the other yet offers possibilities {{to be realized}} at some future point in time. A different model for time sequencing where past, present and future are conceptually more integrated is the New Zealand Maori view of ancestral presence manifest in the past, but also present in the future. To paraphrase a Maori proverb, “the ancestors stand behind a person, but also stand ahead. ” Thus, within this non-European concept of time, the ancestors are simultaneously regarded as both progenitors and future descendants within a time frame conceived as a spiral, which endlessly loops back on itself. With a backdrop of time as a spiraling continuum, this presentation explores the cross-fertilization between Maori weaving heritage and contemporary art making in the two-dimensional <b>pigmented</b> <b>ink</b> drawings of Maori artist, John Bevan Ford, in terms of symbolic, metaphoric and visually mythical language. The inspiration for Ford’s choice of Maori cloaks as the vehicle to graphically represent ancestral lineage as well as sacred, collective and personal history melds ancient mythological themes and cultural attitudes with current innovative, exploratory and creative impulses. Ford’s depiction of sacred cloaks as metaphors for earth and sky aligns with Maori beliefs that cloaks made from plant fiber and feathers embody the gifts of the gods of forest, land and sky. Technically, each object is labor-intensive.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using thermal drop-on-demand ink jet printing to print <b>pigmented</b> <b>ink</b> systems onto textile materials was investigated. Preliminary {{studies showed that}} a novel binder system, Synthappret BAP (traditionally used as a shrink resist treatment for wool), could be successfully incorporated within a screen ink formulation for printing onto cotton fabric. Such a printing ink produced a high quality print which offered the required fastness properties of a textile print whilst maintaining a soft fabric handle. The cross-linking mechanism/properties of the Synthappret BAP were fully characterised. It was found that Synthappret BAP underwent rapid self cross-linking at elevated temperatures. There was no significant evidence of the cross-linking of the Synthappret BAP and the textile fibres. However, the Synthappret BAP was capable of (a) diffusing into the fibre matrix and (b) entrapping the pigment particles, thus, successfully fixing the pigment to the substrate. Such fixation resulted in {{a high degree of}} washfastness and rubfastness. Following the initial success of applying Synthappret BAP as a binder for textile printing, various ink jet printing inks suitable for textile printing were developed. Such inks were tested for physical characteristics required of a typical ink jet printing ink and successfully printed using a desktop ink jet printer. Successful printing of an array of textile materials was achieved.
