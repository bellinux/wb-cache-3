5000|$|De Broglie's thesis {{started from}} the hypothesis, [...] "that to each portion of energy with a proper mass [...] one may {{associate}} a <b>periodic</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{of the frequency}} [...] , such that one finds: [...] The frequency [...] is to be measured, of course, in the rest frame of the energy packet.

50|$|In {{order to}} measure time, one can record {{the number of}} occurrences (events) of some <b>periodic</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> The regular recurrences of the seasons, the motions of the sun, moon and stars were noted and {{tabulated}} for millennia, before {{the laws of physics}} were formulated. The sun was the arbiter of the flow of time, but time was known only to the hour for millennia, hence, the use of the gnomon was known across most of the world, especially Eurasia, and at least as far southward as the jungles of Southeast Asia.|$|E
5000|$|While {{it is true}} that {{electronically}} produced periodic tones (e.g. square waves {{or other}} non-sinusoidal waves) have [...] "harmonics" [...] that are whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency, practical instruments do not all have this characteristic. For example, higher [...] "harmonics"' of piano notes are not true harmonics but are [...] "overtones" [...] and can be very sharp, i.e. a higher frequency than given by a pure harmonic series. This is especially true of instruments other than stringed or brass/woodwind ones, e.g., xylophone, drums, bells etc., where not all the overtones have a simple whole number ratio with the fundamental frequency. The fundamental frequency is the reciprocal of the period of the <b>periodic</b> <b>phenomenon.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{meaning of}} the term {{physical}} quantity is generally well understood (everyone understands what is meant by the frequency of a <b>periodic</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> or the resistance of an electric wire). The term physical quantity does not imply a physically invariant quantity. Length for example is a physical quantity, yet it is variant under coordinate change in special and general relativity. The notion of physical quantities is so basic and intuitive in the realm of science, that it {{does not need to be}} explicitly spelled out or even mentioned. It is universally understood that scientists will (more often than not) deal with quantitative data, as opposed to qualitative data. Explicit mention and discussion of physical quantities is not part of any standard science program, and is more suited for a philosophy of science or philosophy program. The notion of physical quantities is seldom used in physics, nor is it part of the standard physics vernacular. The idea is often misleading, as its name implies [...] "a quantity that can be physically measured", yet is often incorrectly used to mean a physical invariant. Due to the rich complexity of physics, many different fields possess different physical invariants. There is no known physical invariant sacred in all possible fields of physics. Energy, space, momentum, torque, position, and length (just to name a few) are all found to be experimentally variant in some particular scale and system. Additionally, the notion that it is possible to measure [...] "physical quantities" [...] comes into question, particular in quantum field theory and normalization techniques. As infinities are produced by the theory, the actual “measurements” made are not really those of the physical universe (as we cannot measure infinities), they are those of the renormalization scheme which is expressly dependent on our measurement scheme, coordinate system and metric system.|$|E

40|$|We give a {{mass formula}} for {{computing}} the mass spectrum of mesons. By this formula {{we show that}} there are many mesons with their masses corresponding to a prime number. In particular we show that all strange mesons are with their masses corresponding to a prime number. With these prime numbers indexing the mesons we give a classification of mesons. We set up a knot model of mesons to derive this mass formula. In this knot model mesons and their anti-particles are modeled by knots and their mirror images respectively. Then the amphichiral knots which are equivalent to their mirror images are used to model mesons which are identical with their anti-particles. With this knot model we show that there is a <b>periodic</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in the classification of mesons such that the starting nonet and the ending nonet are nonets of pseudoscalar mesons with the π meson modeled by an amphichiral knot.
