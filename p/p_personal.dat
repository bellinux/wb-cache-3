A hybrid P 2 P/Infrastrucutre approach could leverage strengths and address limitations of both paradigms. In this paper we propose such a platform based on MyNet, our P 2 <b>P</b> <b>personal</b> and social networking system. The new hybrid architecture enhances the properties of pervasive access, security {{and ease of use}} found in MyNet through the introduction of infrastructure-hosted MyNet Virtual Devices (MVD). MVDs act as users ’ personal devices, but also host MyNet-aware Internet Services (MaIS), proxies for 3 rd party Internet services. A proof-of-concept prototype and user results are presented to showcase key system features. I...|$|E
40|$|Advances in Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) and web {{technologies}} have recently enabled P 2 <b>P</b> <b>personal</b> and social networking. The {{key to the}} success of such systems is middleware and tools that will allow non-expert consumers to manage their networks and share their resources easily and intuitively. This is the motivation behind MyNet, a P 2 P platform that enables non-expert users to easily organize their resources and share them in their immediate social neighborhood. In this paper, we present our experience following a user-centered approach in designing the MyNet system: using realworld metaphors in the core system, leveraging NFCbased touch to mirror human behavior models, and involving actual users in the design process. The results of our initial usability evaluation are also presented in detail...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Remote medical {{monitoring}} using body {{sensors and}} wireless communications {{has been gaining}} attention recently {{because of the potential}} savings in patient care and the equally impressive enhancements of quality of care for mobile individuals. What makes remote medical monitoring feasible are the advances in the body sensor technology (non-intrusive sensors embedded in actuators to monitor vital signs); and in wireless technology (Body LAN, cellular and Wireless LAN). Currently, most medical vests and body LANs connect to the Internet in a point-to-point fashion, via the cellular system (say SMS). With the growing popularity of ubiquitous computing and opportunistic P 2 <b>P</b> <b>personal</b> networks, it makes sense to explore beyond the point to point health care paradigm and study new models for remote patient care that exploit P 2 P networking among patients and care providers (nurses, doctors, emergency personnel). In this paper we identify several medical care applications based on P 2 P Health Networking. We then focus on two specific scenarios with nurses and patients both equipped with Bluetooth devices: a field hospital where nurses opportunistically collect, share and upload in P 2 P fashion patient medical records during bedside visits, and a field trip situation with patients supervised by nurses, where a patient emergency is promptly reported to the nearest nurse using enhanced inquiry response Bluetooth techniques. Simulation and testbed experiments show that Bluetooth P 2 P networking is both feasible and cost-effective in remote medical monitoring. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{observation}} that T cells expressing V# 17 a TCR are selectively deleted in mice expressing H- 2 I-E molecules (1, 2) provides formal proof {{for the notion}} that self tolerance to MHC molecules involves clonal deletion. Similar selective deletion of T cells in I-E+ mice has also been found for T cells expressing V 011 + TCR (3, 4). Since the deletion of V 017 a+ and Vp 11 + T cells in I-E+ mice is near complete, at least in certain strains, one would expect {{a high proportion of}} V 017 a ' and V# 11 ' T cells produced in I-E- mice to display I-E alloreactivity. The data on this question are confusing. Thus, although a high proportion of V 017 a+ T hybridomas respond to I-E+ stimulator cells in terms of IL- 2 production (1), primary MLRs of I-E- T cells responding to I-E+ stimulators in vitro generate a surprisingly low frequency of V 017 a+ T blast cells (Marrack, <b>P,</b> <b>personal</b> communication). The situation with Vg 11 + T cells is even more confusing since, even at the level of T hybridomas, Vo 11 + T cells show minimal I-E reactivity in vitro (4). Since the information on the I-E reactivity of mature V 017 a+ and V 1 s 11 + T cells rests entirely on responses measured in vitro, the question arises as to whether thes...|$|E

Please click on the alternative location to access it. 212 <b>p.</b> <b>Personal</b> growth and spiritual integration are very important to many adults but are often neglected in the practice of adult education. As infinite empty space, Tao Te Ching can encompass the different worlds of psychology, art, and religion. When adult education is thought of and valued as transformation, the philosophy of Tao Te Ching enables the intuitive consciousness and wisdom to integrate the spirit, mind, and body. The individual thus learns to avoid extremes and to cultivate an unbroken unity between life and the environment in a process of growth and self-actualization. This dissertation is about the integration of the philosophical view of Tao Te Ching with art psychotherapy activities, and adult education practices in general. In order to explore this process, eight Chinese adult learners, all women diagnosed with clinical depression, went through a sixteen-week art therapy workshop. All participants sought to clarify their inner dimensions of self and achieve spiritual development. Hermeneutic methodology was used to interpret their art. The learners became conscious of their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors by creating art. Through art they were able to create new meanings in their lives. As a result of a psychotherapy directed towards spirituality, participants experienced different levels of transformation. In addition, six artists were interviewed on the topic of art and spirituality, and a cross-cultural discussion between five scholars was also recorded. Tao is based on the premises of lifelong learning and is achieved by daily effort. Personal growth and spiritual integration constitute an interwoven pattern of action-inaction (Ying and Yang) and make for a balance between vertical (transcendent experience) and horizontal (experience with others and self) relationships. Tao is grounded in infinite sympathy and creativity. Freedom emerges within the self, not from the dictates of government or institutions that mandate policies. The Tao of adult learning is focused on developing success; on "emptying oneself" of biases, egocentrism, degradation, class, and ethnocentrism; on cultivating a sense of "critical consciousness" through self-corrective participation and reflection. A person comes to know one's position between heaven and earth. As a "co-creator" breaking through the boundary, we embrace the paradox of life with compassion and work towards change and transformation. Finally, we find meaning in life by "passing on" life experiences...|$|E
