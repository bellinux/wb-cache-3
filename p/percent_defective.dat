5000|$|Another {{cellular}} {{case study}} includes quantitative {{estimates of the}} extent to which cells contributed to overall benefits. At Hughes Ground Systems Group (Fullerton, Calif.), producing circuit cards for defense equipment, the first cell, which began as a pilot project with 15 volunteers, was launched in 1987. One month later a second cell began, and by 1992 all production employees, numbering about 150, had been integrated into seven cells. Prior to cells, circuit card cycle time, from kit release to shipment to the customer, had been 38 weeks. After the cells had taken over the full production sequence (mechanical assembly, wave solder, thermal cycle, and conformal coat), cycle time had fallen to 30.5 weeks, of which production manager John Reiss attributed 20 weeks to use of a [...] "WIP chart system" [...] by the cell teams and the other 10.5 weeks to the cellular organization itself. Later, when it seemed that the cells were overly large and cumbersome, cell sizes were shrunk by two-thirds, resulting in “micro cells” that cut cycle time by another 1.5 weeks. Finally, by adopting certain other improvements, cycle times had decreased to four weeks. Other improvements included reducing work-in-process inventory from 6 or 7 days to one day and <b>percent</b> <b>defective</b> from 0.04 to 0.01 Switching from a functional (job-shop) layout to cells often costs has a minus net cost, inasmuch as the cell reduces costs of transport, work-in-process and finished inventory, transactions, and rework. When large, heavy, expensive pieces of equipment (sometimes called “monuments” in lean lingo) must be moved, however, the initial costs can be high to the point where cells are not feasible.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The male female {{difference}} in the variance of quantitative traits including IQ can {{be accounted for by}} the observation of the concentration of genes involved in brain development on the X chromosome and by the mechanism of sex determination in mammals. Females have two X chromosomes with one randomly inactivated. Males have a single X chromosome, which results in increased variance. It is shown that these factors are sufficient to account for the observed differences. The average (mean) scores for males and females for a variety of quantitative traits, including IQ, are almost identical. What is different is that the variance for males is higher 1, 2. This means that there are more males {{at both ends of the}} distribution. There are about 40 <b>percent</b> more mentally <b>defective</b> males than females 3 and it has been argued that the excess of males in the very high IQ regions could account for the differential representation of males in tenured positions on the faculties of research universities particularly in the physical sciences 4.

40|$|Hereditary nonpolyposis {{colorectal}} cancer (HNPCC) {{is associated with}} defects in DNA mismatch repair. Mutations in either hMSH 2 or hMLH 1 underlie the majority of HNPCC cases. Approximately 25 % of annotated hMSH 2 disease alleles are missense mutations, resulting in a single change out of 934 amino acids. We engineered 54 missense mutations in the cognate positions in yeast MSH 2 and tested for function. Of the human alleles, 55 % conferred strong defects, 8 % displayed intermediate defects, and 38 % showed no defects in mismatch repair assays. Fifty <b>percent</b> of the <b>defective</b> alleles resulted in decreased steady-state levels of the variant Msh 2 protein, and 49 % of the Msh 2 variants lost crucial protein–protein interactions. Finally, nine positions are predicted to influence the mismatch recognition complex ATPase activity.

40|$|Two years ago, {{the author}} {{completed}} a study with researchers at Virginia Tech {{that was designed}} to develop a tool to measure and control segregation of hot-mix asphalt pavements. This earlier work focused on the application of high-speed texture measurements and ultimately proposed an approach that would discourage segregation by establishing limits on allowable fluctuation of pavement macrotexture. Rather than emphasize segregation detection and measurement, the proposed special provision promoted new-surface uniformity. The activities discussed in this report represent {{the next step in the}} process of understanding the relationship between the uniformity and surface characteristics of hot-mix asphalt. The study documents the typical “texture profile ” for Virginia’s most common surface mixes. It revisits the texture-fluctuation provision proposed in the earlier project and delves into an expanded use of elevation profiles for promoting uniformity. Although the major findings and conclusions from this work do not specifically support a texture-based “segregation specification, ” the study does advocate continued dedication to material and construction uniformity. Alternatives to a texture-based specification include quality measures that recognize variability of traditional quality characteristics (such as <b>percent</b> <b>defective</b> and percent within limits specifications) and a new approach to reporting and using ride quality data, i. e., “roughness profiles. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the extension of existing single acceptance sampling plans indexed by lot tolerance <b>percent</b> <b>defective</b> (LTPD) or limiting quality (LQ) {{with respect to their}} applicability to high precision processes. LTPD/LQ indexed sampling plans were extended to cover the very low fraction defective levels of high precision processes. Plans based on the ISO 2859 - 2 LQ indexed plans, Dodge-Romig LTPD indexed plans, and lot sensitive plans (LSP) were used as bases for the extensions. Target levels for LTPD/LQ were set at defective parts per million levels ranging from 20 ppm to 5000 ppm. The performance of the extended plans was evaluated using measures relating to level of protection afforded by the plans and efficiency in terms of amount of required inspection. The extended Dodge-Romig LTPD plans showed best performance among the three plans generated. Three selected plans from the extended Dodge-Romig LTPD sampling scheme were then subjected to simulation studies. Comparison of the theoretical and simulation data indicated that the plans behave more strictly than expected from theoretical calculations. The specific demands of high precision processes for appropriate sampling inspection plans that cover lower fraction defective levels, {{and at the same time}} satisfy the requirement for economy and efficiency of inspection were shown to be provided by this plan.

40|$|Abstract:- The paper {{presented}} {{the results of}} the research of elements determining an operating characteristic (OC) curve of specified acceptance sampling plans and gave the evidence that certain relationships of direct or indirect proportionality among these elements existed. Relationships between sampling risks and other elements inbuilt in a single acceptance sampling plan were considered. Average Quality Level desired by the consumer (AQL), and quality level called Lot Tolerance <b>Percent</b> <b>Defective</b> (LTPD) or the worst level of quality that the consumer may tolerate, were both considered. The producer’s risk α was the risk that the sampling plan will fail to verify an acceptable lot’s quality set by AQL and, thus, reject it. The probability of acceptance a lot with LTPD quality was expressed as the consumer’s risk β. The OC curve pertained to a specific plan, i. e. to a combination of the sample size n and the acceptance criterion or level c. Using ExcelOM 2 software, the following findings were found: (1) with c, AQL and LTPD fixed, the increasing sample size n resulted with the risk α increased and the risk β decreased; and (2) with n, AQL and LTPD fixed, the increasing critical value c implicated that the risk α decreased, but the risk β increased; (3) if AQL was increased, with all other components n, c, and LTPD fixed, then producer’s risk α would increased, but consumer’s risk β would remain the same; and, (4) if LTPD is increased, with all other components n, c and AQL fixed, α would remain the same, while β would decrease.

30|$|This paper {{questions}} {{some aspects}} of attribute acceptance sampling {{in light of the}} original concepts of hypothesis testing from Neyman and Pearson (NP). Attribute acceptance sampling in industry, as developed by Dodge and Romig (DR), generally follows the international standards of ISO 2859, and similarly the Brazilian standards NBR 5425 to NBR 5427 and the United States Standards ANSI/ASQC Z 1.4. The paper evaluates and extends the area of acceptance sampling in two directions. First, by suggesting the use of the hypergeometric distribution to calculate the parameters of sampling plans avoiding the unnecessary use of approximations such as the binomial or Poisson distributions. We show that, under usual conditions, discrepancies can be large. The conclusion is that the hypergeometric distribution, ubiquitously available in commonly used software, is more appropriate than other distributions for acceptance sampling. Second, and more importantly, we elaborate the theory of acceptance sampling in terms of hypothesis testing rigorously following the original concepts of NP. By offering a common theoretical structure, hypothesis testing from NP can produce a better understanding of applications even beyond the usual areas of industry and commerce such as public health and political polling. With the new procedures, both sample size and sample error can be reduced. What is unclear in traditional acceptance sampling is the necessity of linking the acceptable quality limit (AQL) exclusively to the producer and the lot quality <b>percent</b> <b>defective</b> (LTPD) exclusively to the consumer. In reality, the consumer should also be preoccupied with a value of AQL, as should the producer with LTPD. Furthermore, we can also question why type I error is always uniquely associated with the producer as producer risk, and likewise, the same question arises with consumer risk which is necessarily associated with type II error. The resolution of these questions is new to the literature. The article presents R code throughout.|$|E

The producer’s risk α is the risk of incorrect rejection is {{the risk that the}} sampling plan will fail to verify an acceptable lot’s quality set by AQL and, thus, reject it. The probability of acceptance a lot with LTPD quality is the consumer’s risk β or the risk of incorrect accepting.
