60|$|Private Copper's {{father was}} a Southdown shepherd; in early youth Copper had studied under him. Five years' army service had {{somewhat}} blunted Private Copper's pastoral instincts, but {{it occurred to him}} as a memory of the Chalk that sheep, or in this case buck, do not move towards one across turf, or in this case, the Colesberg kopjes unless a stranger, or in this case an enemy, is in the neighbourhood. Copper, helmet back-first advanced with caution, leaving his mates of the picket full a mile behind. The picket, concerned for its evening meal, did not protest. A year ago it would have been an officer's command, moving as such. To-day it <b>paid</b> <b>casual</b> allegiance to a Canadian, nominally a sergeant, actually a trooper of Irregular Horse, discovered convalescent in Naauwport Hospital, and forthwith employed on odd jobs. Private Copper crawled up the side of a bluish rock-strewn hill thinly fringed with brush atop, and remembering how he had peered at Sussex conies through the edge of furze-clumps, cautiously parted the dry stems before his face. At the foot of the long slope sat three farmers smoking. To his natural lust for tobacco was added personal wrath because spiky plants were pricking his belly, and Private Copper slid the backsight up to fifteen hundred yards....|$|E

50|$|Seacroft has a poor {{reputation}} across Leeds. A {{large portion}} of the housing is council owned, and jobs tend to be low <b>paid</b> <b>casual</b> or manual work. Many of the houses, particularly prefabricated housing around South Parkway have boarded up and unfit for any future habitation. This is due to a multimillion-pound city re-development scheme whose earlier progress {{can be seen in the}} similar estates around the Coal Road area. The area's poor reputation has been focused on by journalist Donal MacIntyre. Neighbouring Gipton also shares this poor reputation. 85.49% of occupied houses in Seacroft fall within the Band A council tax rate (the lowest based on house values). However, the negative image of Seacroft was challenged in 2008 by a BBC article called 'The Estate' depicting life on the estate.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which women renting in public housing, who are in paid employment, have been able to overcome some of the obstacles to paid work commonly faced by other public housing tenants. Previous work has shown that living in public housing could hinder people’s ability to take up paid work by trapping them in unemployment and poverty. Other research has indicated that by giving people housing stability, living in public housing could facilitate their decision to look for and find paid work. Drawing on an ongoing longitudinal study consisting of interviews with female public housing tenants engaged in paid work in urban and regional Victoria, this research provides insights into how women have been able to enter or return to paid work and whether living in public housing has helped or hindered them in finding paid employment. In particular, this paper shows that even though the women interviewed have been able to overcome some of the obstacles to paid work encountered by other female public housing tenants, they were only able to do so because it was a time in their lives when they either had fewer family responsibilities, had friends or relatives who could look after their children, and/or had experienced improvement in their health conditions. It is argued that, in any case, the majority of these women are still trapped in poverty due to low <b>paid</b> <b>casual</b> work, insufficient welfare provision, {{and the ways in which}} their rents and welfare benefits are affected when they take up paid employment...|$|E
30|$|Our study {{contributes}} to the literature on informal work in several ways. First, nearly all of the empirical evidence on employment transitions in developing countries comes from middle-income countries (e.g., Arias et al. 2013; Bosch and Maloney 2010; Fajnzylber et al. 2006; Goldberg and Pavcnik 2003; Maloney 1999; Nataraj 2011; Paz 2014) or from cross-country studies (e.g., Djankov and Ramalho 2009; LaPorta and Shleifer 2008; Loayza et al. 2005). Very {{little is known about the}} nature of informality in low-income countries (LICs), or in South Asia more broadly. Since conditions that affect the nature of informal work and the decisions that employers make about how to operate—such as infrastructure, institutions, degree of enforcement, and the functioning of credit markets—can be fundamentally different in LICs than in more developed countries, it is critical to empirically examine how informal labor markets function in LICs. Second, our retrospective survey allows us to capture transitions over a period of up to 15 [*]years, which is substantially longer than is often captured in studies of employment transitions. 1 Third, our survey asks respondents about a rich variety of job benefits—including contracts, paid sick leave, <b>paid</b> <b>casual</b> leave (vacation), termination notice, and retirement benefits—for current and previous employment. Thus, we are able to examine whether workers are able to move up or down a “formality ladder” using a more continuous measure of formality. 2 Finally, our survey included information about the reasons for choosing self-employment, about several working conditions (hazards, hygiene, and advancement opportunities, among others), and about overall work satisfaction. These complementary questions are helpful in evaluating whether individuals perceive jobs with fewer benefits as providing alternative opportunities, or as simply being the employment of last resort, and in comparing these jobs with more formal jobs regarding basic working conditions.|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) this paper compares the labour market faced by today's {{teenagers}} {{with that of the}} previous generation. The contention of the paper is that the youth labour market has deteriorated over the last three decades and is now much less favourable than that which faced the parents of today's teenagers. Findings revealed that teenagers now face a highly competitive and limited labour market where most jobs are part-time, low <b>paid</b> and <b>casual.</b> Full-time jobs are hard to find, and those who cannot find them compete with school and university students who want part-time work. Moreover, many teenagers are forced to look for several part-time jobs to make ends meet. Competition from married women in some segment intensifies the competition further. Possible explanations for these findings along with implications for youths are explored in the paper. Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|Many people {{consider}} the softening of regulations under the Agency Work Law as excessive deregulation. However, the tightening of regulations {{that are currently}} under way or {{are expected to be}} implemented in the field of employment laws is more properly called excessive regulation. The typical form of non-regular employment is part-time employment, but agency work accounts for only one-ninth of part-time employment. Excluding students and people 65 or older, growth in non-regular employment has clearly been slowing in recent years. Even though casual employment has increased, regular employment has grown at a faster pace. For both men and women, regular employees account for a historically high percentage of total employment. Although for women, growth in casual employment has surpassed that for men, there has been a major decline in unpaid family workers. If one considers that these unpaid family workers have become <b>paid</b> <b>casual</b> employees, it is not necessarily true that unstable employment has increased. In the debate regarding the strengthening of regulations of non-regular employment, many people are swept away by momentary arguments charged with emotions and based on impressions, and they are not properly aware of these facts. In fact, {{when it comes to the}} agency workers, which has become the target of efforts to strengthen regulations, there is conspicuous excessive regulation. In terms of work related to the operation of office equipment, the typical type of work for agency workers, there is a strange phenomenon that the number of agency workers continues to decline even though the economy has slightly recovered. It is expected that after the strengthening of regulations under the Agency Work Law, the tightening of regulations of fixed-term employment, that is the restricting the case of concluding the fixed-term employment contract to temporary jobs will be implemented. It is, however, overly optimistic to assume that restricting fixed-term employment will lead to an increase in regular employment. Without an appropriate level of regulation, workplaces will not be able to cope with these regulations. This must not be forgotten. ...|$|E
40|$|Not {{everyone}} {{dealing with}} agricultural issues in Malawi appreciates {{the fact that}} smallholders in this country face challenges which are unique in Africa. No other country in Sub-Saharan Africa has population densities of up to 250 to the square km combined with a single rainy season of five months. The five areas with comparable population densities to those of Malawi have rain all the year or have two rainy seasons. Their smallholders can grow perennial food crops and, on {{a small piece of}} land, establish high value perennial cash crops such as tea, coffee and vanilla. On the other hand farmers living in areas with comparable rainfall to Malawi occupy comparatively thinly populated countries and so are able to grow larger areas of food crops to meet their needs and larger areas of low value annual cash crops such as cotton and legumes and so raise some cash for their family requirements. Many Malawian smallholders can adopt neither of these options. The overwhelming majority cannot grow coffee or tea because of inadequate rainfall and the limitations of small farm size means that they can only produce small amounts of any crop other than their basic staples. About 15 % grow burley tobacco but that number cannot be increased as the crop is already over-produced. A further 10 % raise cash from rice, groundnuts, maize and horticultural crops but the great majority have to allocate all of their land to producing food for the family and rely on low <b>paid</b> <b>casual</b> occupations to raise the cash that they need. It {{is for this reason that}} the majority of rural Malawians are classified as being below the poverty line. An appreciation of this situation can help in an understanding of the current state of smallholder farming in Malawi and it is hoped that these notes may cast a little more light on the plight of this country’s millions of small scale farmers and provide some indicators as to how best they can be helped...|$|E

40|$|Teaching in Australian {{universities}} {{is performed}} by {{two groups of}} academic staff, defined {{by the nature of}} the employment contract. While permanent academic staff are engaged in teaching and research, a growing group of hourly <b>paid</b> or <b>casual</b> employees deliver teaching services. This article explores some key dimensions of the work and aspirations of these casual academic staff, including levels of access to job and career supports, and career and job satisfaction. The 2011 Work and Careers in Australian Universities survey of staff in 19 universities provides data from more than 3000 casual academic staff. Three related issues are investigated: the characteristics of labour supply in the casual academic labour force; the key defining boundaries of labour segmentation; and barriers between casual and permanent academic employment. A typology of casual academic staff is proposed. In particular, gender, type of university and discipline are investigated to examine whether these have an impact on the various measures of career opportunity, job satisfaction and the incidence of the 'frustrated academic'. The research reveals that the casual academic labour market is not integrated with the permanent academic labour market and that discipline is a key determinant of the level of 'frustration' of casual academic staff.

40|$|The migrant workers’ {{presence}} in the hotel industry {{has the potential to}} benefit host countries and employers at destination in bringing new skills, knowledge and innovation as well as a competitive advantage to many companies. Migrant workers can also benefit from their migration experience via higher earnings (wage gaps between the country of origin and destination) as well as the acquisition of skills (technical, occupational and soft skills). However, many migrant workers accept low <b>paid</b> and <b>casual</b> work; their employment is oftentimes seasonal. Segmentation of the labour market, stereotyping and discrimination make the foreign(-born) workforce more vulnerable than the local one. Especially where migrant workers have little or no education or training, they face a heightened risk of exploitation. Training opportunities are therefore crucial for migrant workers. As stressed at the Global Dialogue Forum on New Developments and Challenges in the Hospitality and Tourism Sector that was held at the ILO in November 2010, “the future HCT workforce will have greater diversity of gender, ethnic background and age profile.

40|$|Women {{community}} equals men in population. But it is {{a subject}} of concern to note that, women are treated as second citizens, subordinate to men. According to World Labour Report (1992), in advanced countries, in organized sector, women’s pay has been around 50 % of the men’s pay. Similar views were highlighted in the United Nation’s Report (1995) which stated that the returns on her labour are {{lower than that of}} men, partly because of over discrimination, partly because she has acquired fewer marketable skills and partly because of imperfections in the market forces. As a result, women are frequently confined to less <b>paid</b> and <b>casual</b> segments of the labour market. In India, women constitute nearly 48 % of the population but their participation in economic activity is only 25. 7 % (Census, 2001). Besides, their work in the production of goods and services for the market do not get compounded in the market oriented concepts of income and employment due to its being seasonal, intermittent, casual and subsidiary to their household work (Dhameja, 2004). Women are unpaid and underpaid. They work for longer hours than men yet their work is not recognized. The Shramsakthi Report (1988) stated that ‘In India, women work for longer hours and contribute more than men in terms of total labour energy spent, wit...|$|R

40|$|This study {{determines the}} factors that {{influenced}} contract choice, labour demand and examines the existence of labour hoarding practice in Western region of Kenya. Data from Egerton University’s Tegemeo Institute of Agricultural Policy and Development {{was used for the}} analysis [...] A two step Heckman model was employed to estimate the extent of engagement in daily and semi-permanent contracts conditional on choice of contract. Results from the study show that casual and semi-permanent contracts are substitutes. Family labour negatively influences engagement in daily and semi-permanent contracts hence it is a substitute to the two forms of the contracts. Increase in wages <b>paid</b> to <b>casual</b> contracts is negative and significant to the extent of daily contract engagement but positive and significant to semi-permanent contracts supporting the substitutability of daily contracts for semi-permanent contracts. Methods and costs of farm preparation are significant in influencing the choice and demand for any type of contracts. The proxy variable for hoarding costs is significant and positive indicating that there are hoarding costs incurred in the maintaining a steady pool of labour within the farm. From the results the relatively asset poor farmers engage in the wage high daily contracts to avoid incurring hoarding costs as indicated by the dummy denoting poverty level. However, to avoid uncertainty during peak periods semi-permanent contracts are highly employed by the asset poor farmers. From the results, farmers willing to minimize hoarding costs may find themselves substituting family labour for daily contracts or in absence of family labour, semi-permanent contracts for daily contracts.

50|$|Malawi's {{rainfall}} in 1989-90 and 1990-91 was at best {{moderate and}} locally poor. Smallholder food reserves were depleted before the deeper crisis in 1991-92. Rainfall before planting in 1991 {{was low and}} sporadic; withdrawing fertilizer subsidies made a poor harvest poorer. Only 40% of the normal maize crop was gathered in 1992. The famines of the 1990s represent exceptional food shortfalls within longer periods of increasing shortages. Although rainfall or agricultural output data do exist for 1991 and 1992, there are few contemporary accounts of a 1992 famine. This is because President Banda suppressed discussion about food insecurity and information on malnutrition. After he was voted from office a better-documented drought occurred in 1993-94. J Milner, (2004). Agriculture and Rural Development in Malawi: the Role of Policies and Policy Processes, p 42. There are no generally available or accepted figure for famine deaths in 1992. Apart {{from the lack of}} rainfall, the main causes of famine in the 1990s include the state regulation of agriculture and the distortions caused by diverting resources to inefficient estates and failure to support smallholders growing food crops. This intensified pressure on food-growing land without providing an alternative way for poorer Malawians to earn a living' as ADMARC failed to pay reasonable prices for the crops that farmers had to grow.
