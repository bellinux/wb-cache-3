50|$|In the U.S. military's {{strategic}} nuclear weapon nuclear command and control (NC2) system, an Emergency Action Message (EAM) is a <b>preformatted</b> <b>message</b> that directs nuclear-capable forces to execute specific Major Attack Options (MAOs) or Limited Attack Options (LAOs) in a nuclear war. Individual countries or specific regions may be included or withheld in the EAM, as specified in the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP). The SIOP was updated annually until February 2003, when it was replaced by Operations Plan (OPLAN) 8044. Since July 2012, the US nuclear war plan has been OPLAN 8010-12, Strategic Deterrence and Force Employment.|$|E
50|$|Vehicles {{could send}} free text {{messages}} containing up to 1,900 characters. There were all <b>preformatted</b> or 'canned' <b>messages</b> where the driver only needed {{to fill in}} blank fields and hit send. Such messages included NBC1 reports, NEDIVAC message and arrival and departure messages among others.|$|R
50|$|DSC {{distress}} alerts, which {{consist of}} a <b>preformatted</b> distress <b>message,</b> are used to initiate emergency communications with ships and rescue coordination centers. DSC was intended to {{eliminate the need for}} persons on a ship's bridge or on shore to continuously guard radio receivers on voice radio channels, including VHF channel 16 (156.8 MHz) and 2182 kHz now used for distress, safety and calling. A listening watch aboard GMDSS-equipped ships on 2182 kHz ended on February 1, 1999. In May 2002, IMO decided to postpone cessation of a VHF listening watch aboard ships. That watchkeeping requirement had been scheduled to end on February 1, 2005.|$|R
50|$|Satellite systems {{operated}} by the Inmarsat company, overseen by the International Mobile Satellite Organization (IMSO) are also important elements of the GMDSS. The types of Inmarsat ship earth station terminals recognized by the GMDSS are: Inmarsat B, C and F77. Inmarsat B and F77, {{an updated version of}} the now redundant Inmarsat A, provide ship/shore, ship/ship and shore/ship telephone, telex and high-speed data services, including a distress priority telephone and telex service to and from rescue coordination centers. Fleet 77 fully supports the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) and includes advanced features such as emergency call prioritisation. The Inmarsat C provides ship/shore, shore/ship and ship/ship store-and-forward data and email messaging, the capability for sending <b>preformatted</b> distress <b>messages</b> to a rescue coordination center, and the Inmarsat C SafetyNET service. The Inmarsat C SafetyNET service is a satellite-based worldwide maritime safety information broadcast service of high seas weather warnings, NAVAREA navigational warnings, radionavigation warnings, ice reports and warnings generated by the USCG-conducted International Ice Patrol, and other similar information not provided by NAVTEX. SafetyNET works similarly to NAVTEX in areas outside NAVTEX coverage.|$|R
