5|$|In North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch {{due to the}} large influx of <b>people</b> <b>expected</b> during the holiday weekend. As such, {{there was a significant}} drop in tourism, although no significantly adverse weather occurred along the Outer Banks. High waves and some minor beach erosion was reported, but there were no deaths, injuries, or damage from Ella. By the time the hurricane passed Newfoundland, the strongest winds were to the southeast of the center, and as a result, no significant impact was reported on Canada.|$|E
5|$|In London, he {{had been}} {{introduced}} in 1881 to Constance Lloyd, daughter of Horace Lloyd, a wealthy Queen's Counsel. She happened to be visiting Dublin in 1884, when Wilde was lecturing at the Gaiety Theatre. He proposed to her, and they married on 29 May 1884 at the Anglican St James's Church, Paddington in London. Constance's annual allowance of £250 was generous for a young woman (equivalent to about £ in current value), but the Wildes had relatively luxurious tastes, and they had preached to others for so long {{on the subject of}} design that <b>people</b> <b>expected</b> their home to set new standards. No. 16, Tite Street was duly renovated in seven months at considerable expense. The couple had two sons, Cyril (1885) and Vyvyan (1886). Wilde became the sole literary signatory of George Bernard Shaw's petition for a pardon of the anarchists arrested (and later executed) after the Haymarket massacre in Chicago in 1886.|$|E

25|$|With all {{the hype}} {{preceding}} Australia's arrival in England, especially Glenn McGrath's assertion that Australia would win 5–0, many <b>people</b> <b>expected</b> a good, tight contest, although Australia's fans predicted a clear overall victory. English fans were quietly confident that their strong run – winning 15 and drawing two of their last 18 Test matches – would continue and they could at least stand up to Australia, having lost the last eight Ashes series.|$|E

Although few <b>people</b> <b>expected</b> them to stay there, 10th place in the final table was still disappointing. The {{pressure}} began to build up on Hoddle and he was sacked in September 2003 after a poor start to the season, in which the team picked up just four points from their opening six league games and lay in the Premiership relegation zone. Coincidentally, his final game in charge was a 3–1 loss to old side Southampton.|$|E

He was selected for the ECB National Academy squad the following winter, but failed to kick on as <b>people</b> <b>expected</b> and was dropped by Yorkshire during the 2005 season. He averaged in the middle-thirties for the 2005 and 2006 seasons, with a top score of 144 in 2006 but, {{at the end of the}} season, decided against renewing his contract and moved to Hampshire for the 2007 County Championship.|$|E

25|$|Most <b>people</b> <b>expected</b> {{an early}} finish on the Saturday but Burki and Nasim rallied and added 197 {{runs for the}} fifth wicket. At the time, it was a fifth wicket record for Pakistan in all Test cricket and their record stand for any wicket against England. Both batsmen scored 101. It was Nasim's first century and Burki's third against England in five matches. Pakistan were all out soon after tea for 370, leaving England to score 86 to win. Coldwell took six for 85 and {{finished}} his debut with nine wickets in the match, Trueman also taking nine.

25|$|With {{the end of}} the war in 1945, the Soviet <b>people</b> <b>expected</b> to see the end of {{the devastation}} of Nazism, and hoped for the end of Stalin's Purges. But, sealed trains began {{carrying}} large numbers of prisoners to the Soviet Gulags. Some were Nazi collaborators who had fought under General Andrey Vlasov, but most were ordinary Soviet officers and men. Pasternak watched as ex-POWs were directly transferred from Nazi Germany to Soviet concentration camps. White emigres who had returned due to pledges of amnesty were also sent directly to the Gulag, as were Jews from the Anti-Fascist Committee and other organizations. Many thousands of innocent people were incarcerated in connection with the Leningrad Affair and the so-called Doctor's Plot, while whole ethnic groups were deported to Siberia.|$|E
25|$|When Junot entered Lisbon on 30 November 1807, the Portuguese royal family, {{aristocracy}} {{and high}} clergy had already set sail for Brazil the previous day. The French Army was initially well received by Lisboners, General Junot taking {{up residence in}} the Queluz National Palace (Palácio Nacional de Queluz). and redecorating it. The bourgeoisie of Lisbon discussed the new liberal ideas in conversations with French officers in the cafes of the city, particularly the Nicola in Rossio square, where the French established their headquarters. The <b>people</b> <b>expected</b> {{a continuation of the}} political reforms enacted by the Marquis of Pombal, but Junot did not want to risk stimulating radical ideas and did nothing along those lines. Napoleon proposed that Lisbon should be incorporated directly into the French Empire, while the old Portucale of northern Portugal would be resurrected as the 'Kingdom of Northern Lusitania' in the province of Entre Douro e Minho. Meanwhile, 50,000 Spanish and French troops roamed the countryside arresting, killing, plundering and raping the citizenry.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the 2000–01 season, Bud Stefanski {{took over}} a Barrie Colts team that had {{made it all the}} way to the Memorial Cup finals the {{previous}} year. No longer part of the Colts roster were players like Sheldon Keefe, Mike Jefferson, Denis Shvidki, and Michael Henrich, who led the Colts in scoring during their run to the Memorial Cup finals. Not many <b>people</b> <b>expected</b> great things from a rebuilding Colts franchise, but the Colts made it into the playoffs in seventh place with a 29–28–7–4 record. They would lose in 5 games to the Sudbury Wolves. Throughout the season, return players Blaine Down, Mike Henderson and newly appointed captain Matt Dzieduszycki led the charge on offense with 73, 68, and 63 points respectively. In addition, through the several trades that brought in Fraser Clair, Shayne Fryia, and goaltender David Chant as well as the great play of rookie Jan Platil the Colts looked to make a deep run into the playoffs the following season.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>people</b> <b>expected</b> Konishiki {{to quickly}} make his push for yokozuna promotion. His stablemaster, the 46th Yokozuna Asashio Tarō III had {{predicted}} Konishiki would {{reach the top}} rank by his 25th birthday. However, his increasing weight caused a strain on his knee, exacerbated by previous high-school football injuries, which badly affected his performances. After a string of mediocre 8–7 scores he turned in a disastrous 3–12 in September 1988. His problems continued in 1989 and a 5–10 mark in September left him in danger of demotion from ōzeki once again. He made a spectacular comeback in November 1989, taking his first tournament championship with a 14–1 record. He was the first foreigner to win a top division title since Takamiyama in 1972. In March 1990 he {{took part in a}} three-way playoff for the title but he was outshone by Asahifuji, who earned promotion to yokozuna in July. In May 1991 Konishiki won 14 consecutive bouts but was beaten in a playoff on the final day by Asahifuji.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} a number of criticisms of the premium support model. Some have raised concern about risk selection, where {{insurers}} find ways to avoid covering <b>people</b> <b>expected</b> to have high health care costs. Premium support proposals, such as the 2011 plan proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan (R–Wis.), have aimed to avoid risk selection by including protection language mandating that plans participating in such coverage must provide insurance to all beneficiaries and are not able to avoid covering higher risk beneficiaries. Some critics are concerned that the Medicare population, which has particularly high rates of cognitive impairment and dementia, would have a hard time choosing between competing health plans. Robert Moffit, a senior fellow of The Heritage Foundation responded to this concern, stating that while there may be research indicating that individuals have difficulty making the correct choice of health care plan, there is no evidence to show that government officials can make better choices. Henry Aaron, one of the original proponents of premium supports, has recently argued that the idea should not be implemented, given that Medicare Advantage plans have not successfully contained costs more effectively than traditional Medicare and because the political climate is hostile to the kinds of regulations that would be needed to make the idea workable.|$|E

25|$|According to Peter Temin, Barry Wigmore, Gauti B. Eggertsson and Christina Romer {{the biggest}} primary {{impact of the}} New Deal {{on the economy and}} the key to {{recovery}} and to end the Great Depression was brought about by a successful management of public expectations. The thesis is based on the observation that after years of deflation and a very severe recession important economic indicators turned positive just in March 1933 when Roosevelt took office. Consumer prices turned from deflation to a mild inflation, industrial production bottomed out in March 1933, investment doubled in 1933 with a turnaround in March 1933. There were no monetary forces to explain that turnaround. Money supply was still falling and short-term interest rates remained close to zero. Before March 1933 <b>people</b> <b>expected</b> a further deflation and recession so that even interest rates at zero did not stimulate investment. But when Roosevelt announced major regime changes people began to expect inflation and an economic expansion. With those expectations, interest rates at zero began to stimulate investment just as they were expected to do. Roosevelt's fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped to make his policy objectives credible. The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investments. The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard, a balanced budget in times of crises and small government led endogenously to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 70–80 percent of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937. If the regime change had not happened and the Hoover policy had continued, the economy would have continued its free-fall in 1933, and output would have been 30 percent lower in 1937 than in 1933.|$|E
