25|$|Eiffel's {{proposal}} {{was for a}} bridge whose deck was supported by five iron piers, with the abutments of the pair on the river bank also bearing a central supporting arch. The <b>price</b> <b>quoted</b> by Eiffel was FF.965,000, far below the nearest competitor {{and so he was}} given the job, although since his company was less experienced than his rivals the Portuguese authorities appointed a committee to report on Eiffel et Cie's suitability. The members included Jean-Baptiste Krantz, Henri Dion and Léon Molinos, both of whom had known Eiffel for a long time: their report was favorable, and Eiffel got the job. On-site work began in January 1876 and was complete by the end of October 1877: the bridge was ceremonially opened by King Luis I and Queen Maria Pia, after whom the bridge was named, on 4 November.|$|E

[...] The <b>price</b> <b>quoted</b> for the car did not include any of the interior necessities. [...] Many items {{that went into the}} building of the Emmanuel were donations from corporations: brakes from Westinghouse Air Brake Company, various springs and wheels, along with flatware, blankets and a range for cooking. [...] Still others were donated by the various Baptist organizations; the car's furnishings were a gift from the women of the First Baptist Churches of Oakland and San Francisco. The car, which was ten feet longer than the Evangel, was dedicated in Denver, Colorado, on May 24, 1893.|$|E

However, Cooper attended the official opening of the resulting new St Peter's College pavilion and field on 19 November 1960 and he [...] " ... offered the congratulations of the other schools of Auckland and expressed great pleasure that his friendly neighbours had obtained such a handsome new playing field".|$|E

This bachelor thesis was performed together with Byggwalle AB in Västerås with the objective to create a mobile solution for <b>price</b> <b>quotes,</b> based on an earlier experimental prototype. This thesis will look at how the manual <b>price</b> <b>quote</b> creation process can be sped up and made more transparent to build up trust between the companies and the customers. It will also look at the choices made when developing a mobile application for the construction industry, how to make it flexible enough to fit different kinds of businesses, and look at how the data is administrated using a web based administration system. The result of this thesis is a promotional prototype, which sped up the delivery of <b>price</b> <b>quotes</b> from 3 weeks to 3 hours, and will be distributed to selected companies for further testing in the near future. We hope that this product can change the way business is done in construction industry...|$|R

The important part of this thesis represents the analysis of the current situation of the <b>price</b> <b>quoting</b> of travel packages in the Czech Republic in comparison with the situation abroad.
