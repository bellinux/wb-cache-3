40|$|In Pseudomonas putida, the {{expression}} of the pWW 0 plasmid genes for the toluene/xylene assimilation pathway (the TOL pathway) is subject to complex regulation in response to environmental and physiological signals. This includes strong inhibition via catabolite repression, elicited by the carbon sources that the cells prefer to hydrocarbons. The Crc protein, a global regulator that controls carbon flow in pseudomonads, has an important role in this inhibition. Crc is a translational repressor that regulates the TOL genes, but how it does this has remained unknown. This study reports that Crc binds to sites located at the translation initiation regions of the mRNAs coding for XylR and XylS, two specific transcription activators of the TOL genes. Unexpectedly, eight additional Crc binding sites were found overlapping the translation initiation sites of genes coding for several enzymes of the pathway, all encoded within two <b>polycistronic</b> <b>mRNAs.</b> Evidence is provided supporting the idea that these sites are functional. This implies that Crc can differentially modulate {{the expression}} of particular genes within <b>polycistronic</b> <b>mRNAs.</b> It is proposed that Crc controls TOL genes in two ways. First, Crc inhibits the translation of the XylR and XylS regulators, thereby reducing the transcription of all TOL pathway genes. Second, Crc inhibits the translation of specific structural genes of the pathway, acting mainly on proteins involved in the first steps of toluene assimilation. This ensures a rapid inhibitory response that reduces {{the expression of}} the toluene/xylene degradation proteins when preferred carbon sources become available...|$|R

As the requirements for intercistronic mRNA processing into stable monocistronic transcript are not well understood, we have sought to define minimum sequence elements that trigger processing and thus are capable of generating stable translatable monocistronic mRNAs. We describe here the in vivo identification of a small intercistronic expression element that mediates intercistronic cleavage into stable monocistronic transcripts.

To study the mechanisms of SD sequence recognition, we have analyzed translation initiation from mRNAs containing multiple SD sequences. Comparing translational efficiencies of identical transgenic mRNAs in Escherichia coli and plastids, we find surprising {{differences between the two}} systems. Most importantly, while internal SD sequences are efficiently recognized in E. coli, plastids exhibit a bias toward utilizing predominantly the 5 ′-most SD sequence.

In this study, we used these methods to begin {{an analysis of the}} roles of E 1 [...] E 4 and E 5 in HPV pathogenesis by mutating the major splice at nt 3295. Mutation of SPA 3295 did not significantly alter the ability of HPV- 31 genomes to replicate transiently in keratinocytes, nor did the mutation affect the immortalization potential of HPV- 31. However, genomes carrying the SPA 3295 mutation were not stably maintained as viral episomes, and the resulting immortalized keratinocyte cell line contained multiple, integrated copies of the mutated HPV- 31 DNA. Northern analysis indicated that cell lines immortalized with the mutant HPV- 31 expressed transcripts which were similar in size and abundance to wild-type messages, including those transcripts which rely on utilization of SPA 3295. RNase protection and reverse transcription-PCR revealed that mutation of SPA 3295 resulted in the utilization of a cryptic splice acceptor at nt 3298. These data suggest that the requirements for stable maintenance of HPV genomes are more stringent than those for transient replication and that factors which define these requirement rely on the major splice acceptor at nt 3295...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{cauliflower}} mosaic virus transactivator, TAV, controls translation reinitiation of major open reading frames on polycistronic RNA.

Post-transcriptional operons represent a powerful mechanism to organize and express genetic information as functionally related combinations of monocistronic mRNAs.

50|$|One of {{the ways}} that latency is {{achieved}} and maintained is through histone modification. It is known that methylation of histones often serve as marks that cause the formation of heterochromatin, an inactive form of chromatin, while acetylation often marks euchromatin, an active form of chromatin. In EBV, The amount and location of the histone modifications is different for each latency program. There are several promoter regions which are the key targets of this histone modification in each of these programs. There are the Cp and Qp promoter regions. The Cp promoter promotes the transcription of all the EBNA genes from a <b>polycistronic</b> <b>mRNA.</b> The Q promoter (Qp) promotes the transcription of EBNA1. In type I latency, the Qp is acetylated and active while the Cp region is methylated and inactive. The opposite is true in type III latency where the Cp region is active and the Qp region is inactive. In both of these types of latency, H3K27me is slightly enriched in the lytic immediate early promoters.

Our data indicate that eIF 4 B interferes with TAV/eIF 3 / 40 S ribosome complex formation during the first initiation event. Consequently, overexpression of TAV in plant protoplasts affects only second initiation events. Transient overexpression of eIF 4 B in plant protoplasts specifically inhibits TAV-mediated reinitiation of a second ORF.

40|$|M 2 - 1 protein {{of human}} {{respiratory}} syncytial virus (RSV) is a transcription antitermination factor that {{is important for the}} efficient synthesis of full-length mRNAs {{as well as for the}} synthesis of <b>polycistronic</b> readthrough <b>mRNAs,</b> which are characteristic of nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses. The contributions of these effects to RSV sequential transcription were investigated with minigenomes which contained one to five genes which were either foreign marker genes or authentic RSV genes. When evaluated on a promoter-proximal gene, the effect of M 2 - 1 on the synthesis of full-length mRNA was much greater for a long (1, 212 - or 1, 780 -nucleotide) gene (up to a 615 -fold increase) than for a short (274 -nucleotide) gene (less than a 2 -fold increase). This was independent of whether the gene contained non-RSV or RSV-specific sequence. Once the polymerase had terminated prematurely, it was unable to reinitiate at a downstream gene. These studies also confirmed that M 2 - 1 enhances the synthesis of <b>polycistronic</b> <b>mRNAs</b> and that the magnitude of this effect varied greatly among different naturally occurring gene junctions. The synthesis of <b>polycistronic</b> <b>mRNAs,</b> which presumably involves antitermination at the gene-end signal, required a higher level of M 2 - 1 than did the synthesis of the corresponding monocistronic mRNAs. M 2 - 1 did not have a comparable antitermination effect at the junction between the leader region and the first gene. In a minigenome containing the NS 1 and NS 2 genes in their authentic sequence context, synthesis of full-length NS 1 and NS 2 mRNAs in the absence of M 2 - 1 was remarkably high (36 and 57 %, respectively, of the maximum levels observed in the presence of M 2 - 1). In contrast, synthesis of mRNA from additional downstream genes was highly dependent on M 2 - 1. Thus, RSV has the potential for two transcription programs: one in the absence of M 2 - 1, in which only the NS 1 and NS 2 genes are transcribed, and one in the presence of M 2 - 1, in which sequential transcription of the complete genome occurs. The dependence on M 2 - 1 for transcription was greater for a gene in the fifth position from the promoter than for one in the third position. This indicates that under conditions where M 2 - 1 is limiting, its concentration affects the gradient of transcription. Although M 2 - 1 was found to have profound effects on transcription, it had no effect on replication of any minigenome tested, suggesting that it is not an active participant in RNA replication or regulation of RNA replication. Finally, since a permissive RSV infection is marked by a gradual increase in the intracellular accumulation of viral proteins including M 2 - 1, we examined the relative abundances of various mRNAs during RSV infection for evidence of temporal regulation of transcription. None was found, implying that the availability of M 2 - 1 during a permissive infection is sufficient at all times such that its concentration does not mediate temporal regulation of gene transcription...|$|R
