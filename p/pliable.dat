5|$|Although {{the archaeological}} record does not provide {{examples}} of brushes or pens, analysis of ink strokes on the Postclassic codices suggests that it was applied with a brush with a tip fashioned from <b>pliable</b> hair. A Classic period sculpture from Copán, Honduras, depicts a scribe with an inkpot fashioned from a conch shell. Excavations at Aguateca uncovered a number of scribal artefacts from the residences of elite status scribes, including palettes and mortars and pestles.|$|E
5|$|The Four {{from the}} Fantastick: A band of explorers who gained powers when their ship {{encountered}} a strange energy vortex at sea. The four are Captain Benjamin Grimm, Sir Richard Reed, Susan Storm, and John Storm, Their bodies were reshaped into the four elements: Reed's flesh became <b>pliable</b> like water; Grimm's body became solid rock; Susan's body became weightless and invisible like air; and John's body became living fire. They are eventually captured by Doom.|$|E
5|$|The {{filaments}} exhibit random {{orientations and}} are often wavy, which has been interpreted as evidence that they were soft and <b>pliable</b> in life. Microscopic examination shows that individual filaments appear dark along the edges and light internally, suggesting that they were hollow, like modern feathers. Compared to modern mammals the filaments were quite coarse, with each individual strand much larger and thicker than the corresponding hairs of similarly sized mammals.|$|E
5|$|The skin of {{crocodilians}} {{is thick}} and cornified, and is clad in non-overlapping scales known as scutes, arranged in regular rows and patterns. These scales are continually being produced by cell {{division in the}} underlying layer of the epidermis, the stratum germinativum, and the surface of individual scutes sloughs off periodically. The outer surface of the scutes consists of the relatively rigid beta-keratin while the hinge region between the scutes contains only the more <b>pliable</b> alpha-keratin.|$|E
5|$|Glasses {{and certain}} types of {{plastics}} are commonly welded materials. Unlike metals, which have a specific melting point, glasses and plastics have a melting range, called the glass transition. When heating the solid material into this range, it will generally become softer and more <b>pliable.</b> When it crosses through the glass transition, {{it will become a}} very thick, sluggish, viscous liquid. Typically, this viscous liquid will have very little surface tension, becoming a sticky, honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the glass transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.|$|E
5|$|Power was now wielded by {{the senior}} bureaucrats, who {{installed}} {{the weak and}} <b>pliable</b> al-Muqtadir on the throne. Over the next decades, the expenditure of both the court and the army increased, while maladministration and strife between military and bureaucratic factions intensified. By 932, when al-Muqtadir was assassinated, the Caliphate was effectively bankrupt, and authority soon devolved {{on a series of}} military strongmen who competed for control of the caliph and the title of amīr al-umarāʾ. This process culminated in the capture of Baghdad in 946 by the Buyids, who put an end to caliphal independence even in name. Thereafter the caliphs remained as symbolic figureheads, but were divested of any military or political authority or independent financial resources.|$|E
5|$|The polyatomic {{nonmetals}} are {{distinguished from}} the diatomic nonmetals by virtue of having higher coordination numbers, higher melting points (in their thermodynamically most stable forms), and higher boiling points; and having wider liquid ranges and lower room temperature volatility. More generally they show a marked tendency to exist in allotropic forms, and a stronger inclination to catenate; and have a weaker ability to form hydrogen bonds. The ability of carbon to catenate, in particular, is fundamental {{to the field of}} organic chemistry and life on Earth. All of the polyatomic nonmetals are solids, and all are known in either malleable, <b>pliable</b> or ductile forms; most also have lower ionisation energies and electronegativities than those of the diatomic nonmetals.|$|E
5|$|The NAACP later {{blamed the}} PTC {{management}} for intentionally dragging its {{feet on the}} contract that the TWU approved in late June. The NAACP claimed that the PTC management had hoped to undermine the TWU's position with the workers and to possibly oust TWU {{in favor of the}} more <b>pliable</b> PRTEU. The PTC was aware that the SmithConnally Act forbade strikes harming war production and that if, with a contract impasse, TWU itself had initiated a contract strike, the union might have been tossed out. This analysis of the situation was shared later by several historians, particularly by James Wolfinger. Another historian, Alan M. Winkler, also had a largely negative view of the company's role in the conflict and concluded that PTC management, while not overtly conspiring with the strikers, reacted feebly to the strike and tried to opportunistically exploit the situation and the racist attitudes of many white workers for their own purposes.|$|E
5|$|The Reactionary Party (the former {{dissident}} conservative {{elements within}} the Moderate Party) began by passing the Interpretation of the Additional Act, which {{was followed by the}} reform of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Both laws, built upon the 1834 Additional Act, would allow the national government to reassert its control over provincial police and courts. They would provide the means to deal effectively with provincial rebellions and inevitably grant the national government greater sway over the provincial governments. In turn, the party in power would gain greater ascendancy in national politics through patronage and office appointments. Fearful that their adversaries would stay in power indefinitely, the Liberals began to call for PedroII to attain majority at a younger age. They hoped to regain their influence by doing away with the regency and dealing directly with a <b>pliable</b> young emperor. Towards that end, the Liberals allied themselves with the Facção Áulica (Courtier Faction), led by Aureliano Coutinho (Feijó's ally in the 1832 coup attempt).|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of grey jays live {{where there is a}} strong presence of black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), Engelmann spruce (P. engelmanni), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), or lodgepole pine (P. contorta). Grey jays do not inhabit the snowy, coniferous, and therefore seemingly appropriate Sierra Nevada of California where no spruce occur. Nor do grey jays live in lower elevations of coastal Alaska or British Columbia dominated by Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). The key habitat requirements may be sufficiently cold temperatures to ensure successful storage of perishable food and tree bark with sufficiently <b>pliable</b> scales arranged in a shingle-like configuration that allows grey jays to wedge food items easily up into dry, concealed storage locations. Storage may also be assisted by the antibacterial properties of the bark and foliage of boreal tree species. An exception to this general picture may be the well-marked subspecies P. c. obscurus. It lives right down to the coast from Washington to northern California in the absence of cold temperatures or the putatively necessary tree species.|$|E
25|$|The pendant nest is an {{elongated}} sac woven of <b>pliable</b> {{materials such as}} grasses and plant fibers and suspended from a branch. Oropendolas, caciques, orioles, weavers and sunbirds are among the species that weave pendant nests.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been shown that a more {{powerful}} voice may be achieved with a fatter and fluid-like vocal fold mucosa. The more <b>pliable</b> the mucosa, the more efficient the transfer of energy from the airflow to the vocal folds.|$|E
25|$|It {{took nearly}} two centuries for a salutary {{blending}} of the scholarly Sanskrit and popular styles to bring Malayalam prose to its present form, enriched in its vocabulary by Sanskrit {{but at the}} same time flexible, <b>pliable</b> and effective as to popular parlance.|$|E
25|$|The general {{effect of}} the water content upon the wood {{substance}} is to render it softer and more <b>pliable.</b> A similar effect occurs in the softening action of water on rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits, the greater the water content, the greater its softening effect.|$|E
25|$|The cup nest is {{smoothly}} hemispherical inside, {{with a deep}} depression {{to house}} the eggs. Most are made of <b>pliable</b> materials—including grasses—though a small number are made of mud or saliva. Many passerines and a few non-passerines, including some hummingbirds and some swifts, build this type of nest.|$|E
25|$|Usually, the {{stronger}} a metal is, the less <b>pliable</b> it is. This {{is not the}} case with copper. A unique combination of high strength and high ductility makes copper ideal for wiring systems. At junction boxes and at terminations, for example, copper can be bent, twisted, and pulled without stretching or breaking.|$|E
25|$|Intuitively, two {{spaces are}} homeomorphic {{if one can}} be {{deformed}} into the other without cutting or gluing. A traditional joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a coffee mug from a doughnut, since a sufficiently <b>pliable</b> doughnut could be reshaped to a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while shrinking the hole into a handle.|$|E
25|$|In 1737, Vaucanson built The Flute Player, {{a life-size}} {{figure of a}} {{shepherd}} that played the tabor and the pipe and had a repertoire of twelve songs. The figure's fingers were not <b>pliable</b> enough to play the flute correctly, so Vaucanson had to glove the creation in skin. The following year, in early 1738, he presented his creation to the Académie des Sciences.|$|E
25|$|An {{emerging}} view is {{that the}} Dewatto fault marks {{the western edge of the}} relatively rigid Seattle Uplift (see map). Accommodation of strain (displacement) between the Seattle Fault and the Saddle Mountain deformation zone is likely distributed across the more <b>pliable</b> sediments of the Dewatto Basin; this, and the greater depth to the Crescent Formation, may account for the subdued expression of the Seattle Fault west of Green Mountain.|$|E
25|$|Their {{dwellings}} {{were built}} by placing vertical poles {{in the form}} of circles or ovals. The construction techniques incorporated log floors covered in clay, wattle-and-daub walls that were woven from <b>pliable</b> branches and covered in clay and a clay oven, which was situated in the centre of the dwelling. As the population in this area grew, more land was put under cultivation. Hunting supplemented the practice of animal husbandry of domestic livestock.|$|E
25|$|Ballet {{shoes are}} soft, <b>pliable</b> shoes made of canvas or leather, with either {{continuous}} or two-part sole (also called split-sole), used for ballet dancing. The sole is typically made of leather, with thicker material under {{the ball and}} heel of the foot, and thinner and thus more flexible material under the arch so that the foot can be easily pointed. They are typically secured by elastics {{across the top of}} the foot.|$|E
25|$|Three {{assassination}} {{attempts were}} made on Qin Shi Huang's life, leading him to become paranoid and obsessed with immortality. He died in 210 BC, while {{on a trip to}} the far eastern reaches of his empire in an attempt to procure an elixir of immortality from Taoist magicians, who claimed the elixir was stuck on an island guarded by a sea monster. The chief eunuch, Zhao Gao, and the prime minister, Li Si, hid the news of his death upon their return until they were able to alter his will to place on the throne the dead emperor's most <b>pliable</b> son, Huhai, who took the name of Qin Er Shi. They believed that {{they would be able to}} manipulate him to their own ends, and thus effectively control the empire. Qin Er Shi was, indeed, inept and <b>pliable.</b> He executed many ministers and imperial princes, continued massive building projects (one of his most extravagant projects was lacquering the city walls), enlarged the army, increased taxes, and arrested messengers who brought him bad news. As a result, men from all over China revolted, attacking officials, raising armies, and declaring themselves kings of seized territories.|$|E
25|$|Human VF are paired {{structures}} {{located in}} the larynx, just above the trachea, which vibrate and are brought in contact during phonation. The human VF are roughly 12 – 24mm in length, and 3–5mm thick. Histologically, the human VF are a laminated structure composed of five different layers. The vocalis muscle, {{main body of the}} VF, is covered by the mucosa, which consists of the epithelium and the lamina propria. The latter is a <b>pliable</b> layer of connective tissue subdivided into three layers: the superficial layer (SLP), the intermediate layer (ILP), and the deep layer (DLP). Layer distinction is either made looking at differential in cell content or extracellular matrix (ECM) content. The most common way being to look at the ECM content. The SLP has fewer elastic and collagenous fibers than the two other layers, and thus is looser and more <b>pliable.</b> The ILP is mostly composed of elastic fibers, while the DLP has fewer elastic fibers, and more collagenous fibers. In those two layers, which form {{what is known as the}} vocalis ligament, the elastic and collagenous fibers are densely packed as bundles that run almost parallel to the edge of the vocal fold.|$|E
25|$|Kempeitai {{personnel}} {{were dressed in}} the standard Japanese military uniform, but they were distinguished by an armband bearing the Japanese characters for Kempeitai (憲兵隊). They also wore khaki uniforms with an armband or were simply dressed in civilian clothes. While officers were armed with a shin guntō (military sword) and a pistol, non-commissioned officers often carried a bamboo stick split at the ends to make it <b>pliable</b> and to increase the pain felt by {{a person who was}} hit.|$|E
25|$|The first {{surgical}} approach {{consists in}} the resection and primary anastomosis. This {{first stage of}} surgery is performed on patients with a well vascularized, nonedematous and tension-free bowel. The proximal margin should be an area of <b>pliable</b> colon without hypertrophy or inflammation. The distal margin should extend to the upper third of the rectum where the taenia coalesces. Not all of the diverticula-bearing colon must be removed, since diverticula proximal to the descending or sigmoid colon are unlikely to result in further symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Grand Duke Andrei was tall, shy {{and good}} looking. Efforts {{to make him}} settle down with a bride of royal blood were unsuccessful. He {{was very close to}} his mother, {{particularly}} {{after the death of his}} father in 1909, and manipulated her to his advantage, which his siblings resented. His <b>pliable</b> personality made him more popular within the Romanov family than his siblings. He was a good friend of his cousin Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, who was a year older.|$|E
25|$|Ball: It is made {{of either}} rubber or {{synthetic}} material (<b>pliable</b> plastic) provided it possesses the same elasticity as rubber. It is from 18 to 20cm in diameter and must have a minimum weight of 400g. The ball can be of any colour and should rest in the gymnast's hand, not the wrist. Fundamental elements of a ball routine include throwing, bouncing, and rolling. The gymnast must use both hands {{and work on the}} whole floor area while showing continuous flowing movement. The ball is to emphasize the gymnast's flowing lines and body difficulty.|$|E
25|$|Beneath the Cascade Volcanic Arc, a dense oceanic plate plunges {{beneath the}} North American Plate; {{a process known}} as subduction. As the oceanic slab sinks deep into the Earth's {{interior}} beneath the continental plate, high temperatures and pressures allow water molecules locked in the minerals of solid rock to escape. The water vapor rises into the <b>pliable</b> mantle above the subducting plate, causing some of the mantle to melt. This newly formed magma rises toward the Earth's surface to erupt, forming a chain of volcanoes (the Cascade Volcanic Arc) above the subduction zone.|$|E
25|$|Military strongman Fulgencio Batista {{staged a}} coup on March 10, 1952, {{removing}} Carlos Prío Socarrás from power. Cubans in general were stunned, but remembering the bloodshed of the Batista's {{rule in the}} 1930s, they were reluctant to fight. Batista created a consultative council from <b>pliable</b> political personalities of all parties who appointed him President months before elections were to be held. Batista’s past democratic and pro-labor tendencies {{and the fear of}} another episode of bloody violence gained him tenuous support from the bankers, and the leader of the major labor confederation.|$|E
25|$|Roughly speaking, a {{topological space}} is a {{geometric}} object, and the homeomorphism is a continuous stretching and bending {{of the object}} into a new shape. Thus, a square and a circle are homeomorphic to each other, but a sphere and a torus are not. An often-repeated mathematical joke is that topologists can't {{tell the difference between}} a coffee cup and a donut, since a sufficiently <b>pliable</b> donut could be reshaped to the form of a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while preserving the donut hole in a cup's handle.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{the muscle}} {{proteins}} denature in varying degree, {{with the exception}} of the collagen and elastin of connective tissue, and rigor mortis resolves. Because of these changes, the meat is tender and <b>pliable</b> when cooked just after death or after the resolution of rigor, but tough when cooked during rigor. As the muscle pigment myoglobin denatures, its iron oxidates, which may cause a brown discoloration near the surface of the meat. Ongoing proteolysis also contributes to conditioning. Hypoxanthine, a breakdown product of ATP, contributes to the meat's flavor and odor, as do other products of the decomposition of muscle fat and protein.|$|E
25|$|Iverson, {{last man}} in, {{arrived on the}} scene with his old battle-axe bat. This bat, which must be one of the strangest ever to make an {{appearance}} in a Test match, is bolstered up with a solid slab of leather bound firmly round the blade. It has the colour of a very old violin. Its handle is so <b>pliable</b> that it can be twisted in all directions. It must have seen its best days when its owner was a little boy at school. It has been a scrap-heap job for years. But Iverson seldom places much strain upon it.|$|E
25|$|Xeris {{spectrum}} {{belongs to}} the group of insects with complete metamorphosis (Endopterygota), who undergoes a metamorphosis during development. Between the larval stage and the adult stage is the chrysalis stage, a rest period, in which wasps inner and outer bodies change. The larvae's <b>pliable</b> and soft body is transformed into a pupa with a hard shell. When the shell is hard starting transformation from larva to the adult. The internal organs are lost in varying degrees down to a cell mass. A reorganization takes place and the animal transformed. The length of the pupa phase varies according to temperature. The entire development from egg to adult takes several years.|$|E
25|$|Ball: It is made {{of either}} rubber or {{synthetic}} material (<b>pliable</b> plastic) provided it possesses the same elasticity as rubber. It is from 18 to 20cm in diameter and must have a minimum weight of 400g. The ball can be of any color. The ball should rest in the gymnast's hand and not rest against the wrist or {{be able to be}} grasped. Fundamental elements of a ball routine include throwing, bouncing or rolling. The gymnast must use both hands and work on the whole floor area whilst showing continuous flowing movement. The ball is to emphasize the gymnasts flowing lines and body difficulty.|$|E
25|$|Stephens {{and fellow}} Georgia Representative Robert Toombs campaigned for the {{election}} of Zachary Taylor as President in 1848. Both were chagrined and angered when Taylor proved less than <b>pliable</b> on aspects of the Compromise of 1850. Stephens and Toombs both supported the Compromise of 1850 though they opposed the exclusion of slavery from the territories {{on the theory that}} such lands belonged to all of the people. The pair returned from the District of Columbia to Georgia to secure support for the measures at home. Both men were instrumental in the drafting and approval of the Georgia Platform, which rallied Unionists throughout the Deep South.|$|E
25|$|Whereas most {{dwellings}} in Madagascar {{are traditionally}} constructed from <b>pliable</b> plant materials, the Antandroy {{are one of}} the few ethnic groups to use wood plank to build their homes. Antandroy homes are traditionally square (not rectangular, as elsewhere on the island), raised on low stilts, topped with a peaked roof and constructed of vertically-hung planks of wood affixed to a wooden frame. These houses traditionally have no windows and feature three wooden doors: the front door is the women's entrance, the door at the rear of the house is for children, and the third door is used by the men. Fences are often constructed around Antandroy houses using prickly-pear cactus (raketa) or lengths of indigenous succulents from the surrounding spiny forests.|$|E
