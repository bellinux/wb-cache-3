60|$|The burning {{match was}} quickly plunged into Hayward's handful of shavings, which blazed {{up as he}} thrust it into Slag's nest; and Slag, holding the nest with the tender care of a loving sick-nurse, and the cool {{indifference}} of a salamander, till it was a flaming ball, crammed it {{into the heart of}} the <b>pile</b> of <b>sticks.</b> Tremendous was the volume of smoke that arose from the pile, and anxious were the looks riveted on it.|$|R
60|$|Caleb went to {{the place}} and began to work. He cut down bushes, and placed them up against the rocks, {{in such a manner}} as to make a little hut which he should get into. He then {{collected}} a <b>pile</b> of <b>sticks</b> in front of it. First, he picked up all the dry sticks he could find near, and then he sawed off branches from the old dead trees which were lying around in the forest.|$|R

6000|$|So Raymond {{pointed to}} a place among some rocks off at a little {{distance}} before him, near the line {{in which he was}} coming along with his fence, and advised Caleb to make a fire there. Caleb liked this plan very much. He said he would play [...] "camp out," [...] and so build a camp, and have a fire before the camp. Raymond told him that so soon as he should get his <b>pile</b> of <b>sticks</b> ready, he would come and strike fire for him.|$|R
60|$|As {{the chief}} proceeded, {{he became more}} {{cautious}} and slow in his choice. Finery tempted him on the one hand, necessaries pressed him on the other, {{and at this point}} the trader stepped in to help him to decide; he recommended, warned, and advised. Twine was to be got for nets and fishing-lines, powder and shot, axes for cutting his winter firewood, cloth for his own and his wife's leggings, knives, tobacco, needles, and an endless variety of things, which gradually lessened his little <b>pile</b> of <b>sticks,</b> until at last he reached the sticking point, when all his sticks were gone.|$|R
500|$|The {{process of}} {{destroying}} the tally sticks began at dawn on 16 October and continued throughout the day; two Irish labourers, Joshua Cross and Patrick Furlong, were assigned the task. Weobley checked {{in on the}} men throughout the day, claiming subsequently that, on his visits, both furnace doors were open, which allowed the two labourers to watch the flames, while the <b>piles</b> of <b>sticks</b> in both furnaces were only ever [...] high. Another witness to the events, Richard Reynolds, the firelighter in the Lords, later {{reported that he had}} seen Cross and Furlong throwing handfuls of tallies onto the fire—an accusation they both denied.|$|R
60|$|So {{whenever}} {{they got the}} chance, the little people of the Green Forest and Green Meadows would steal up to the shore of Paddy's new pond and chuckle as they {{looked out at the}} great <b>pile</b> of <b>sticks</b> and mud which Paddy had built for a house, but in which he had forgotten to make a room. At least they supposed that he had forgotten this very important thing. He must have, for there wasn't any room. It was a great joke. They laughed a lot about it, and they lost {{a great deal of the}} respect for Paddy which they had had since he built his wonderful dam.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of November 16, 1982, Kemp's car was found {{abandoned}} with its engine still running, on a ramp off the I-80, 40 {{miles from the nearest}} town. The car was so full of belongings that {{there would have been no}} space for anyone except the driver. A single pair of footprints in the snow led investigators six miles into the wilderness to a barn, where they found a <b>pile</b> of <b>sticks</b> arranged to start a fire, and three of Kemp's socks. There were no footprints leading away from the barn, but Kemp was nowhere to be found. Nearby, investigators found a duffel bag containing laundry soap, clothes and a teapot, all of which belonged to Kemp.|$|R

When he is living in rocky country, he makes it amongst the rocks. In some places he burrows in the ground.

The sticks and thorns are to protect it from enemies. When he lives down where cactus grow, those queer plants with long sharp spines, he uses these, and there are few enemies who will try to pull one of these houses apart to get at him.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} season extends from early February to late July, the driest {{time of the}} year.

A clutch of two is laid; the eggs are white with blotches and spots of dark red and black.|$|R
60|$|The boys {{walked over}} to the house, which stood among some low bushes. It was a {{dilapidated}} structure, and had evidently been out of repair for several years. Most of the windows were gone, and the front door stood wide open.

He points his gun, demanding she undress, becoming more enraged the longer she refuses. Suddenly, the tremors of the volcano eruption reach them, startling {{what appears to be a}} turtle-like Ankylosaur from the bushes. Sid fires blindly behind him as he flees into the jungle. Some time later, as Maggie sits warming herself by the fire, she calls out to him: [...] "You can come out now. It's gone." ...|$|R

It really is a very fine foundation, Peter; it really is. But what I can't understand is what Paddy is thinking of by building that great pile of mud right in the middle.

50|$|Conceptual {{models from}} {{experience}} and intuition from past fires {{can be used}} to anticipate the future. Many semi-empirical fire spread equations, as in those published by the USDA Forest Service, Forestry Canada, Nobel, Bary, and Gill, and Cheney, Gould, and Catchpole for Australasian fuel complexes have been developed for quick estimation of fundamental parameters of interest such as fire spread rate, flame length, and fireline intensity of surface fires at a point for specific fuel complexes, assuming a representative point-location wind and terrain slope. Based on the work by Fons's in 1946, and Emmons in 1963, the quasi-steady equilibrium spread rate calculated for a surface fire on flat ground in no-wind conditions was calibrated using data of <b>piles</b> of <b>sticks</b> burned in a flame chamber/wind tunnel to represent other wind and slope conditions for the fuel complexes tested.|$|R

Pooh and Piglet built it for him after accidentally mistaking the original house that Eeyore built for a <b>pile</b> of <b>sticks.</b> On Eeyore's birthday, he is given an empty honey jar from Pooh for keeping things in, a popped red balloon from Piglet to keep in the pot, and a note from Owl.|$|R
50|$|Then Cuisenaire {{took us to}} a {{table in}} one corner of the room where pupils were {{standing}} round a <b>pile</b> of colored <b>sticks</b> and doing sums which seemed to me to be unusually hard for children of that age. At this sight, all other impressions of the surrounding vanished, to be replaced by a growing excitement. After listening to Cuisenaire asking his first and second grade pupils questions and hearing their answers immediately and with complete self-assurance and accuracy, the excitement then turned into irrepressible enthusiasm and a sense of illumination.|$|R
60|$|Jonas {{said that}} the boys might make one little pile of their own if they wished; {{and told them that}} they must first make a <b>pile</b> of solid <b>sticks,</b> and dry rotten logs as large as they could lift or roll, so as to have a good solid fire underneath, and then cover these up with brush as high as they could pile it, so as to make a great blaze. He told them also that they must make their pile where it would not burn any of the trees which he had left standing, for he had left a great many of the large oaks, and beeches, and pines, to {{ornament}} the ground and make a shade.|$|R
6000|$|A {{little later}} came Gawain Douglas, whose {{translation}} of the Aeneid is linguistically valuable, and whose introductions to the seventh and twelfth books--the one describing winter and the other May--have been safely praised, they are so hard to read. There is certainly some poetic feeling in them, and the welcome to the sun comes as near enthusiasm as is possible for a ploughman, with a good steady yoke of oxen, who lays over one furrow of verse, and then turns about to lay the next as cleverly alongside it as he can. But it is a wrong done to good taste to hold up this item kind of description any longer as deserving any other credit {{than that of a}} good memory. It is a mere bill of parcels, a post-mortem inventory of nature, where imagination is not merely not called for, but would be out of place. Why, a recipe in the cookery-book is as much like a good dinner as this kind of stuff is like true word-painting. The poet with a real eye in his head does not give us everything, but only the best of everything. He selects, he combines, or else gives what is characteristic only; while the false style of which I have been speaking seems to be as glad to get a pack of impertinences on its shoulders as Christian in the Pilgrim's Progress was to be rid of his. One strong verse that can hold itself upright (as the French critic Rivarol said of Dante) with the bare help of the substantive and verb, is worth acres of this dead cord-wood <b>piled</b> <b>stick</b> on stick, a boundless continuity of dryness. I would rather have written that half-stanza of Longfellow's, in the [...] "Wreck of the Hesperus," [...] of the [...] "billow that swept her crew like icicles from her deck," [...] than all Gawain Douglas's tedious enumeration of meteorological phenomena put together. A real landscape is never tiresome; it never presents itself to us as a disjointed succession of isolated particulars; we take it in with one sweep of the eye,--its light, its shadow, its melting gradations of distance: we do not say it is this, it is that, and the other; and we may be sure that if a description in poetry is tiresome there is a grievous mistake somewhere. All the pictorial adjectives in the dictionary will not bring it a hair's-breadth nearer to truth and nature. The fact is that what we see is in the mind to a greater degree than we are commonly aware. As Coleridge says,-- ...|$|R

6000|$|Yes, {{a western}} trapper has a grand, massive {{notion of a}} fire, and his actions are all in keeping with that notion. Almost {{everything}} is small at the fountain. A mighty river usually begins in a bubbling spring or a tiny rivulet. So the trapper's initial acts are delicate. He handles the tinder gently, and guards it from damp. He fosters the spark, when caught, and blows upon it softly, and wraps it up in dry grass, and watches it intently as a mother might watch the life-spark of her new-born babe.

50|$|In {{its most}} pure form, street hockey is always played on an outdoor surface (very often a street, parking lot, tennis court or other asphalt surface), thus {{the genesis of}} the name street hockey.

Alternatively, all the players put their <b>sticks</b> in a <b>pile</b> and the <b>sticks</b> are tossed out of the pile to opposing sides. In more organized forms, it is played in rinks which often were designed for roller hockey and can be indoor or outdoor rinks.
