40|$|For {{existing}} bridges {{with large}} uncertainties, analytical methods have limitations. Therefore, to reduce these uncertainties, field testing of a bridge can be used. A type {{of such a}} field test is a <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> test, in which a load equivalent to the factored live load is applied. If the bridge can carry this load without signs of distress, the <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> test is successful, {{and it has been}} shown experimentally that the bridge fulfils the code requirements. It should be understood that this method for assessment is different from the diagnostic load tests that are carried out in Ecuador prior to opening a bridge. The <b>loads</b> used for <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests are significantly larger. Therefore, it is important to instrument the bridge for a <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> test, and to evaluate during the test that the load does not result in permanent damage to the bridge. To research this topic, and to develop recommendations for <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests, a series of <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests and a collapse test were carried out in the Netherlands. Additional laboratory testing was carried out as well. Based on this information, recommendations for <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests of reinforced concrete slab bridges have been developed for the failure modes of flexure and shear. In the German and North American guidelines for load testing, load testing for shear is not permitted. However, many existing bridges do not fulfil the requirements for shear upon assessment according to the current live load models. Even though more experimental research is needed to develop <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> testing for shear in a guideline or code for the Netherlands, the currently available research results already lead to interesting conclusions with regard to the behaviour of bridges <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tested in shear, and the required safety margin to avoid damage to the bridge.

40|$|Many bridges in The Netherlands {{are built}} around 1960 - 1970 and {{currently}} reach their designed service life of 50 years. The traffic loads are increasing and new insights in the behaviour of constructions are obtained. Therefore there are doubts about safety of these bridges and viaducts and these must be assessed. As the current safety codes {{have changed over}} the years, not all structures fulfil the current safety requirements, however replacement of the bridges brings undesirable high cost with it. Therefore alternative ways are sought to demonstrate the safety requirements. One way {{to do so is}} by <b>proof</b> <b>loading,</b> during which the structure is loaded in a controlled way. During <b>proof</b> <b>loading</b> stop criteria are used, which are measurable parameters that indicate the condition of the structure during the <b>proof</b> <b>loading</b> test.

40|$|Loading {{protocols}} {{and acceptance}} criteria {{are available in}} the literature for load tests on buildings. For bridges, proof load tests are interesting when crucial information about the structure is missing, or when the uncertainties about the structural response are large. The acceptance criteria can then be applied to evaluate if further loading is acceptable, or could lead to permanent damage to the structure. To develop loading protocols and acceptance criteria for <b>proof</b> <b>loading</b> of reinforced concrete bridges, beam experiments were analyzed. In these experiments, different loading speeds, constant load level times, numbers of loading cycles, and required number of load levels were evaluated.

40|$|<b>Proof</b> pile <b>load</b> {{tests are}} an {{important}} means to cope with uncertainties {{in the design and}} construction of pile foundations. In this paper, a systematic method to incorporate the results of <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests not conducted to failure into the design of pile foundations is developed. In addition, illustrative acceptance criteria for driven piles based on <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests are proposed for use in a reliability-based design. Finally, modifications to conventional proof test procedures are studied so that the value derived from proof tests can be maximized. Whether or not a proof test is conducted to failure, its results can be used to update the probability distribution of the pile capacity using the method proposed in this paper. Hence, contributions of the proof test can be included in foundation design in a logical manner by considering several load test parameters such as the number of tests, the test load, the factor of safety, and test results. This adds value to <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests and warrants improvements in the procedures for acceptance of pile foundations using <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> tests.

40|$|The bridges built {{during the}} {{development}} of the Dutch road network after the Second World War are reaching their originally devised service life. A large subset of the Dutch bridge stock consists of reinforced concrete slab bridges. This bridge type often rates insufficient according to the recently introduced Eurocodes. Therefore, more suitable methods are developed to assess reinforced concrete slab bridges to help transportation officials make informed decisions about the safety and remaining life of the existing bridges. If information about a bridge is lacking, if the reduction in structural capacity caused by material degradation is unknown, or if an assessment shows insufficient capacity but additional capacity can be expected, a bridge might be suitable for a field test. A <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> test demonstrates that a given bridge can carry a certain load level.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} to estimate reliability for stress rupture of composite overwrap pressure vessels (COPVs) and similar composite structures.

In addition, the model predicts that even though there is strength decay due to <b>proof</b> <b>loading,</b> a significant overall increase in reliability is gained by eliminating any weak vessels, which would fail early. The model predicts that there should be significant periods of safe life following <b>proof</b> <b>loading,</b> because time is required for the strength to decay from the proof stress level to the subsequent loading level. Suggestions for testing the strength decay reliability model have been made.

40|$|Stress rupture is {{a failure}} {{mechanism}} where failures can occur {{after a period of}} time, even though the material has seen no increase in load. Carbon/epoxy composite materials have demonstrated the stress rupture failure mechanism. In a previous work, a model was proposed for stress rupture of composite overwrap pressure vessels (COPVs) and similar composite structures based on strength degradation. However, the original model was limited to constant load periods (holds) at constant load. The model was expanded in this paper to address arbitrary loading histories and specifically the inclusions of ramp loadings up to holds and back down. The broadening of the model allows for failures on loading to be treated as any other failure that may occur during testing instead of having to be treated as a special case. The inclusion of ramps can also influence the length of the "safe period" following <b>proof</b> <b>loading</b> that was previously predicted by the model. No stress rupture failures are predicted in a safe period because time is required for strength to decay from above the proof level to the lower level of loading. Although the model can predict failures during the ramp periods, no closed-form solution for the failure times could be derived. Therefore, two suggested solution techniques were proposed. Finally, the model was used to design an experiment that could detect the difference between the strength decay model and a commonly used model for stress rupture. Although these types of models are necessary to help guide experiments for stress rupture, only experimental evidence will determine how well the model may predict actual material response. If the model can be shown to be accurate, current <b>proof</b> <b>loading</b> requirements may result in predicted safe periods as long as 10 (13) years. COPVs design requirements for stress rupture may then be relaxed, allowing more efficient designs, while still maintaining an acceptable level of safety...|$|E
