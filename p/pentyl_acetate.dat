40|$|The {{effects of}} thiol-specific {{reagents}} on the amplitude of the electro-olfactogram (E. O. G.) responses elicited from frog olfactory mucosa by pulses of odorant vapours was studied. The impermeant thiol-specific reagent mersalyl [(3 -{[2 -(carboxymethoxy) -benzoyl]amino}- 2 -methoxypropyl) hydroxymercury monosodium salt] brings about a rapid {{decrease in the}} E. O. G. signal obtained with the odorant <b>pentyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> The extent of the decrease {{is proportional to the}} concentration of the mersalyl applied and the effect of the reagent is partially but incompletely reversed by treatment of the labelled mucosa with dithiothreitol. The sites labelled by mersalyl can be protected by pretreating the mucosa with a dilute solution of the odorant <b>pentyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and leaving the solution in contact with the tissue after the addition of mersalyl. When the protecting odorant is washed out of the tissue, the original E. O. G. amplitude is regained. <b>Pentyl</b> <b>acetate</b> applied to the mucosa protected the E. O. G. response to vapour pulses of the following odorants from the effects of mersalyl: n-butyric acid, n-butyl acetate, phenylacetaldehyde and cineole (1, 3, 3 -trimethyl- 2 -oxabicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane). The <b>pentyl</b> <b>acetate</b> applied to the mucosa failed to protect the E. O.

40|$|International audienceReception of odorant {{molecules}} within insect olfactory organs involves several sequential steps, {{including their}} transport through the sensillar lymph, {{interaction with the}} respective sensory receptors, and subsequent inactivation. Odorant-degrading enzymes (ODEs) putatively {{play a role in}} signal dynamics by rapid degradation of odorants {{in the vicinity of the}} receptors, but this hypothesis is mainly supported by in vitro results. We have recently shown that an extracellular carboxylesterase, esterase- 6 (EST- 6), is involved in the physiological and behavioral dynamics of the response of Drosophila melanogaster to its volatile pheromone ester, cis-vaccenyl acetate. However, as the expression pattern of the Est- 6 gene in the antennae is not restricted to the pheromone responding sensilla, we tested here if EST- 6 could play a broader function in the antennae. We found that recombinant EST- 6 is able to efficiently hydrolyse several volatile esters that would be emitted by its natural food in vitro. Electrophysiological comparisons of mutant Est- 6 null flies and a control strain (on the same genetic background) showed that the dynamics of the antennal response to these compounds is influenced by EST- 6, with the antennae of the null mutants showing prolonged activity in response to them. Antennal responses to the strongest odorant, <b>pentyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> were then studied in more detail, showing that the repolarization dynamics were modified even at low doses but without modification of the detection threshold. Behavioral choice experiments with <b>pentyl</b> <b>acetate</b> also showed differences between genotypes; attraction to this compound was observed at a lower dose among the null than control flies. As EST- 6 is able to degrade various bioactive odorants emitted by food and plays a role in the response to these compounds, we hypothesize a role as an ODE for this enzyme toward food volatiles...|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} nano-patterning {{by the way}} of electron beam lithography with satisfying requirements for electroforming replication of desired patterns. Electron beam lithography {{can be used for}} creating nano graphics (images, text etc.) due to its very high resolution and precision. However, patterns created by electron beam lithography cannot be applied for mass production directly because of resist material soft nature (usually a polymer material). Because of that, hard printing plate must be produced. Nickel plate prepared by electroforming is one of the ways to accomplish that. Prior to the production of nickel plate by electroforming, the surface of polymer material has to be covered by a sufficiently thick layer of metal. This procedure can lead to a partial destruction of the motif (completely covered by metal) thus the decreasing of nano graphics resolution. In this paper several nano graphics (images and text with various resolutions) are prepared in positive resist PMMA (thickness of 2000 nm) by e-beam lithography. Chemical developer (<b>pentyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> was used for wet developing of prepared patterns. The sputtering of silver (100 nm) was carried out to achieve sufficient thickness of conductive layer for electroforming.

40|$|Adult Lepidoptera {{are capable}} of {{associative}} learning. This helps them to forage flowers or to find suitable oviposition sites. Larval learning has never been seriously considered because they have limited foraging capabilities and usually depend on adults as concerns their food choices. We tested if Spodoptera littoralis larvae can learn to associate an odor with a tastant using a new classical conditioning paradigm. Groups of larvae were exposed to an unconditioned stimulus (US: fructose or quinine mixed with agar) paired with a conditioned stimulus (CS: hexanol, geraniol or <b>pentyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> in a petri dish. Their reaction to CS was subsequently tested in a petri dish at different time intervals after conditioning. Trained larvae showed a significant preference or avoidance to CS when paired with US depending on the reinforcer used. The training was more efficient when larvae were given a choice between an area where CS-US was paired and an area with no CS (or another odor). In these conditions, the memory formed could be recalled at least 24 h after pairing with an aversive stimulus and only 5 min after pairing with an appetitive stimulus. This learning was specific to CS because trained larvae were able to discriminate CS from another odor that was present during the training but unrewarded. These results suggest that Lepidoptera larvae exhibit more behavioral plasticity than previously appreciated...|$|E
30|$|After {{additional}} solvent development, {{the contrast}} curve (Figure  1 b) shows a mixed behavior, {{rather than a}} simple positive or negative tone behavior. At very low exposure doses, since the unexposed resist is soluble in <b>pentyl</b> <b>acetate</b> developer whereas electron beam exposure decomposed the resist to generate less soluble decomposition product, the resist exhibited a negative tone. At higher doses, on the one hand, the resist was increasingly decomposed and vaporized with increasing doses, {{which led to the}} tendency of positive tone; on the other hand, as the degree of decomposition increased, the decomposition product became less soluble in the solvent developer, resulting in the tendency of negative tone after solvent development. As a consequence of those two competing trends, there exists a turning point exposure dose (approximately 1, 200 μC/cm 2) that gave a maximum remaining thickness. Such an exposure behavior can lead to complex structure as shown in Figure  2 b, which is due to proximity exposure at the surrounding area beyond the directly exposed area. In fact, such kind of mixed exposure property is well {{known for a long time}} for PMMA that displays a positive tone at low doses and becomes a negative tone at approximately 10 times higher doses [21], which was also employed to generate complex structures [22]. Though less known, another popular resist ZEP- 520 A actually also exhibits a mixed tone behavior just like PMMA [23]. However, unlike PMMA and ZEP for which the negative tone behavior appears only after roughly 10 times higher doses, for nitrocellulose, the negative tone behavior proceeds the positive tone, and the dose ranges for the two tones have a large overlap and thus they are not clearly separated.|$|E
40|$|Volatile aroma-active esters are {{responsible}} for the fruity character of fermented alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine. Esters are produced by fermenting yeast cells in an enzyme-catalyzed intracellular reaction. In order to investigate and compare the roles of the known Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol acetyltransferases, Atf 1 p, Atf 2 p and Lg-Atf 1 p, in volatile ester production, the respective genes were either deleted or overexpressed in a laboratory strain and a commercial brewing strain. Subsequently, the ester formation of the transformants was monitored by headspace gas chromatography and gas chromatography combined with mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Analysis of the fermentation products confirmed that the expression levels of ATF 1 and ATF 2 greatly affect the production of ethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate. GC-MS analysis revealed that Atf 1 p and Atf 2 p are also responsible for the formation of a broad range of less volatile esters, such as propyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, <b>pentyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> hexyl acetate, heptyl acetate, octyl acetate, and phenyl ethyl acetate. With respect to the esters analyzed in this study, Atf 2 p seemed to play only a minor role compared to Atf 1 p. The atf 1 ? atf 2 ? double deletion strain did not form any isoamyl acetate, showing that together, Atf 1 p and Atf 2 p {{are responsible}} for the total cellular isoamyl alcohol acetyltransferase activity. However, the double deletion strain still produced considerable amounts of certain other esters, such as ethyl acetate (50 % of the wild-type strain), propyl acetate (50 %), and isobutyl acetate (40 %), which provides evidence for the existence of additional, as-yet-unknown ester synthases in the yeast proteome. Interestingly, overexpression of different alleles of ATF 1 and ATF 2 led to different ester production rates, indicating that differences in the aroma profiles of yeast strains may be partially due to mutations in their ATF genes. 10 page(s...|$|E

First of all, ab initio calculations {{were carried out}} for every conformer at MP 2 / 6 311 ++G(d,p) level. The theoretical rotational constants were used to predict the spectra. In the next step, broadband scans were recorded in selected ranges and the measured lines were re-measured in the high resolution mode. Three conformers were assigned for the molecule n-butyl acetate, two for the molecule n-pentyl acetate, {{and one for the}} molecule n-hexyl acetate. Comparing the experimental with the theoretical values, the structures of these assigned conformers were obtained. The strongest lines of each spectrum belong to the conformer with the lowest energy, which has C 1 symmetry. A conformer with CS symmetry was assigned for each of the molecules n-butyl acetate and n <b>pentyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> Comparing the structures of the conformers with lowest energy, the results show, that by extending the carbon chain successively, the previous structure is conserved. The new carbon atoms are added antiperiplanar. For the energetically lowest conformers of n-butyl acetate, n-pentyl acetate, and n hexyl acetate quantum chemical calculations with different methods and basis sets were carried out. The used methods are Hartee-Fock (HF), second order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP 2), Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the Becke Lee Yang functional (B 3 LYP).
