However, the presence of dissolved salts may inhibit or retard the treatment process. In this study, wastewater desalination by electrodialysis (ED) associated with an advanced oxidation process (photo-Fenton) was applied to an aqueous NaCl solution containing phenol. The influence of process variables on the demineralization factor was investigated for ED in pilot scale and a correlation was obtained between the <b>phenol,</b> <b>salt</b> and water fluxes with the driving force. The oxidation process was investigated in a laboratory batch reactor and a model based on artificial neural networks was developed by fitting the experimental data describing the reaction rate {{as a function of the}} input variables. With the experimental parameters of both processes, a dynamic model was developed for ED and a continuous model, using a plug flow reactor approach, for the oxidation process. Finally, the hybrid model simulation could validate different scenarios of the integrated system and can be used for process optimization.

However, the presence of ionic compounds associated with organic pollutants may retard the oxidation. In this work the transport of species contained in an aqueous solution of phenol containing sodium chloride was evaluated in an electrodialysis (ED) system. An experimental study was carried out in which the influence of the process variables on the phenol loss and sodium chloride removal was investigated. Experiments were also performed without current, {{in order to determine the}} phenol transfer due to diffusion. The phenol and salt concentration variations in the ED compartments were measured over time, using dedicated procedures and an experimental design to determine the global characteristic parameters. A phenomenological approach was used to relate the <b>phenol,</b> <b>salt</b> and water fluxes with the driving forces (concentration and electric potential gradients). Under ED conditions, two contributions were pointed out for the phenol transport, i. e. diffusion and convection, this latter coming from the water flux due to electroosmosis related to the migration of salts. The fitting of the parameters of the transport equations resulted in good agreement with the experimental results over the range of conditions investigated. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

However, the presence of dissolved salts may inhibit or retard the treatment process. In this work, a coupled process is studied including a desalination step by electrodialysis (ED) associated with an advanced oxidation process (photo-Fenton) with a synthetic wastewater containing NaCl and phenol. The experimental study concerning ED was carried out using a pilot plant. The influence of process variables, like the initial water composition and the electrical current intensity, on the demineralization factor was investigated. Experiments were also performed without electrical current application, {{in order to determine the}} unfavorable phenol transfer through the membranes due to diffusion. The phenol and salt concentration variations in the ED compartments were measured over time, using dedicated procedures and an experimental design to determine the global characteristic parameters. A phenomenological approach was used to relate the <b>phenol,</b> <b>salt</b> and water fluxes with the driving force (concentration and electric potential gradients). Under normal ED conditions, two contributions were pointed out for the phenol transport, i. e. Diffusion and convection, this latter coming from the water flux due to electroosmosis related to the migration of salts. The fitting of the parameters of the transport equations resulted in good agreement with the experimental results over the range of conditions investigated. Photo- enton oxidation process was studied in a laboratory batch reactor. As expected, the results confirm the negative effect of the salt concentration on the phenol removal efficiency by oxidation. This effect was not found to be linear concerning salt concentration and degradation rate. Due to the complexity of these reaction systems, a model based on artificial neural networks has been developed to fit the experimental data. This model describes the evolution of the pollutant concentration i. e. phenol, by means of a reaction rate, during irradiation time under various operating conditions.

More than 90 % of the tannins can be removed. However, the recoveries of danshensu, rosmarinic acid, and salvianolic acid B were less than 60 %. Total tannin removal increased as the refrigeration temperature decreased or the amount of NaOH solution added increased. Phenolic compound recoveries increased as refrigeration temperature increased or the amount of NaOH solution added decreased. When operated at a low refrigeration temperature, a relative high separation selectivity can be realized. Phenolic compound losses and tannin removal were mainly caused by precipitation. The formation of <b>phenol</b> <b>salts,</b> whose solubility is small in the mixture of ethanol and water used, is probably the reason for the precipitation. A model considering dissociation equilibrium and dissolution equilibrium was established. Satisfactory correlation results were obtained for phenolic compound recoveries and total tannin removal.

30|$|In this study, the {{performance}} of an aerobic {{moving bed biofilm reactor}} (MBBR) was assessed for the removal of phenol as the sole substrate from saline wastewater. The effect of several parameters namely inlet phenol concentration (200 – 1200  mg/L), hydraulic retention time (8 – 24  h), inlet salt content (10 – 70  g/L), phenol shock loading, hydraulic shock loading and salt shock loading on {{the performance}} of the 10  L MBBR inoculated with a mixed culture of active biomass gradually acclimated to <b>phenol</b> and <b>salt</b> were evaluated in terms of phenol and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies. The results indicated that phenol and COD removal efficiencies are affected by HRT, <b>phenol</b> and <b>salt</b> concentration in the bioreactor saline feed. The MBBR could remove up to 99 % of phenol and COD from the feed saline wastewater at inlet phenol concentrations up to 800  mg/L, HRT of 18  h and inlet salt contents up to 40  g/L. The reactor could also resist strong shock loads. Furthermore, measuring biological quantitative parameters indicated that the biofilm plays a main role in phenol removal. Overall, the results of this investigation revealed that the developed MBBR system with high concentration of the active mixed biomass can play a prominent role in order to treat saline wastewaters containing phenol in industrial applications as a very efficient and flexible technology.|$|R

High capacity of the investigated MBBR to complete removal of phenol in saline wastewater {{could be attributed to}} use of the mixed culture of gradually acclimated active biomass to <b>phenol</b> and <b>salt,</b> using the biofilm carriers with high specific surface area available for microbial growth and high filling ratio.|$|R
30|$|The present work {{investigated}} {{the performance of}} a bench scale MBBR for phenol removal from saline wastewater. The results revealed that the MBBR provides improved phenol and COD removal efficiencies. Inlet phenol concentrations up to 800  mg/L did not significantly affect the performance of the MBBR with HRT of 24  h and salt content of 30  g/L, where phenol and COD removal efficiencies were above 99 %. Optimum HRT for the reactor was 18  h, such that decreasing HRT below this value led to reduction of the removal efficiencies of both phenol and COD. The MBBR exhibited low sensitivity to increasing salt concentrations up to 40  g/L. The reactor was very stable against <b>phenol,</b> hydraulic and <b>salt</b> shock loadings and performed well under various operational conditions. The active biofilm containing yeast as a predominant species performed the main role in phenol removal in the MBBR. Overall, high performance of the investigated MBBR in the removal of phenol from saline wastewater could be attributed to existence of the mixed culture of gradually acclimated biomass to <b>phenol</b> and <b>salt</b> and using a high filling ratio of the biofilm carriers with a high effective surface area.|$|R

30|$|It can be {{concluded}} from above that an optimum HRT for the MBBR under the selected operational conditions was 18  h, at which phenol and COD removal efficiencies were above 99 % and no metabolites were detected. Thus, this value {{was selected as}} the optimum retention time for the next phases of the experiment. Accordingly, the optimum surface loading rate based on HRT (at inlet phenol concentration of 800  mg/L) on the MBBR was found to be 4.1  g phenol/m 2.day (8.82  g COD/m 2.day).

Sonication for phenol degradation has proved to be an attractive process over the years but percentage of phenol degradation under sonication have always been quite low and the use of catalyst also is not cost effective method.

40|$|Phenol {{is highly}} {{reactive}} toward electrophilic aromatic substitution. By this general approach, many groups can be appended to the ring, via halogenation, acylation, sulfonation, and other processes. Phenol contains the hydroxyl group (–OH), {{which is a}} strongly activating ortho/para directing group in aromatic electrophilic substitution (AES). AES gives a mixture of ortho-and para isomers, which must be separated. The strong directing ability of phenol can also result in multiple substitutions on the aromatic ring which could be a major concern in the regiospecific synthesis of phenols. AES and Directed ortho [...] Metalation (DoM) are the only ways to directly substitute a proton on an aromatic ring and to synthesize regiospecifically substituted phenols. Phenol is a versatile precursor to a large collection of drugs, most notably aspirin, but also many herbicides and pharmaceuticals. AES reactions are useful in regiospecific synthesis {{as a way of}} introducing many reactive groups on the benzene ring and also help us to design a suitable method for synthesizing compounds in an efficient manner. Dimethylbenzylamine products are obtained {{as a result of the}} reaction of <b>phenols</b> with Eschenmoser’s <b>salt</b> (N,N-Dimethylmethyleneiminium iodide). This approach enables us to prepare regiospecifically ortho substituted phenols by using the AES protocol. We have discovered that Eschenmoser’s salt has the ability in basic medium containing triethylamine (TEA) to remove the proton and bond to the aromatic ring exclusively in ortho position to the –OH substituent. Our research work focused on efforts to render isolated products with minimum impurities, greener and more atom economical by use of limiting reagent in the reactions. For the purpose of evaluation of the obtained compounds and intermediates we use Gas Chromatography (GC), Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Our future work is to synthesize novel benzoheterocyclic compounds from the ortho-derivatised phenols as well as multi-substituted aromatic compounds. The dimethylamino methyl group can act as a directing group in the ortho-lithiation process; subsequent ortho [...] metalation and treatment with electrophiles generates 1, 2, 3 - trisubstituted phenolic derivatives. Thus, phenolic precursors can be transformed into numerous derivatives which can be used in the chemical, agricultural and pharmaceutical industries...|$|R
40|$|The olive humid husk (OHH) is {{the main}} solid {{by-product}} derived from the olive oil industry. The treatment and disposal of this biomass is difficult because its high moisture and its high content of mineral <b>salts,</b> <b>phenols,</b> lipids and organic acids {{that makes it a}} phytotoxic material. Among the available technologies to dispose this waste, composting has been considered the best solution due to its low cost and benefits for the agriculture. The composted OHH returns to croplands the organic matter and nutrients lost by intensive cultivation and avoids at the same time some of the drawbacks often observed when OHH is directly applied to the soil. However, due to the high content of lignocellulosic materials, oil, and antimicrobial compounds, OHH composting is a difficult slow process, not suitable for the industry. In the current research, looking for the production of a green composted amendment, thirteen microorganisms were specifically selected to enhance OHH degradation. The selected microorganisms were then utilized as inoculum in a composting trial that was carried out in dynamic turned Piles. The results indicated that microbial inoculation accelerates the degradation of OHH, reducing the time of composting. In addition, the microbial inoculum had a positive influence on compost quality. The final product showed a deeper humification and better detoxification. Besides, with the aim to improve the suppressive properties of compost, the biocontrol strain B. subtillis M 51 /II was included in the microbial consortium of the inoculum. The persistence of the strain during the whole composting process was monitored using together a selective microbial analysis and a specific colony PCR assay. The results indicated that the strain B. subtillis M 51 /II was not only able to survive to the composting process but also able to increase its density. In this thesis, for the first time, it has been set up a procedure for the production of a high quality green composted amendment from OHH in a relatively short time. Besides, the results shows that the use of a microbial inoculum for the production of OHH compost could be successful as a good delivery system to introduce the microbial biocontrol strain B. subtillis into the soil...|$|R
40|$|Wastewaters of {{the wood}} {{processing}} into groundwood are characterized by increased concentrations of organic contaminants (oils, resin acid, lignin (polymeric <b>phenols),</b> lignin <b>salts</b> (sulphonates, phenoxides), tannins, triglycerides, waxes, free long-chained fatty acids and other). Organic compounds which appear as colour come from extracted lignin, tannins and resin acids. Wood processing effluents are often resistant to degradation using biological methods, and are not removed effectively by conventional physicochemical treatment methods, such as coagulation/flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and ozonation. For processing of those effluents it is often necessary to link different methods of purification, {{and one of the}} alternative methods is sorption. In this work the removal of organic pollutants was tested from effluent of the production of mechanically milled groundwood by using sorption to clinoptilolite tuff and to samples of tuff which were modified using the solutions of cationic surfactant- hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA-Br) of different concentrations. The sorption processes of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide were researched on the clinoptilolite tuff from Turkey (Aegean Region Turkey, Bigadic), which contains more than 70 % of clinoptilolite, and in smaller mass fraction quartz and opal-CT are present. The tested effluent has the following characteristics: chemical oxygen demand (COD) : 13200 mg dm- 3, total organic carbon (TOC) : 3010 mg dm - 3, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) : 470 mg dm- 3, colour: 681 Pt Co, turbidity: 799 NTU, pH 4. 8. All testing was done without the adjustment of pH. The conventional process of pre-processing of effluent by coagulation with aluminum chloride hexahydrate (AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O) was tested and the application ofHDTMA-modified clinoptilolite tuff with the intention of further decrease in organic burden of wastewater. In the Fig. 1 A the results of the HDTMA uptake onto clinoptilolite tuff are shown, and in Fig. 1 B the pertaining zeta potentials of the samples are shown. HDTMA cations were essentially quantitatively taken up by the clinoptilolite tuff up to loading level of L = 0. 204 mmol g - 1 -(Fig. 1 A). The results of the zeta potential measurements show that the negative surface charge changed to positive after modification with surfactant solutions (Fig. 1 B). HDTMA cations form a stable organophilic coating on the clinoptilolite surface, and above surfactant loading level of 0. 110 mmol g - 1 (isoelectric point), a second layer of HDTMA+ cations reverses the surface charge into positive. The optimal mass concentration of coagulant AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O for the tested wastewater is γ = 0. 8 g dm - 1 (Figs. 2 A and 2 B). Zeta potential of the solution above sediment received by coagulation with AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O of mass concentration γ= 0. 8 g dm - 3 is ζ= - 3. 92 mV. The efficiency of removing the turbidity (Table 1) and COD is η = 67 % (from 799 to 263 NTU) and 54 % (from 13 200 to 6 040 mg dm - 3). The efficiency of removing solved organic carbon and colour is significantlylesser: 22. 7 % (from 3010 to 2322 mg dm- 3) and η = 33. 0 % (from 681 to 457 Pt Co). By processing the solutions received after coagulation with AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O of mass concentration of 0. 8 g dm - 3, with natural tuff and organo-zeolites whose loading are: 0. 074; 0. 123; 0. 164 and 0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA, TOC was decreased from γ= 2322 mg dm- 3 to the following: γ= 2042, 1976, 1945, 1907 and 1821 mg dm - 3 and was sorbed: q = 28. 0; 34. 6; 37. 7; 41. 5; and 50. 1 mg g - 1 TOC (Fig. 3 A). Using the sample of organo-zeolite with loading of 0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA, the efficiency of removing the organic carbon was improved from η= 22. 7 % to 40. 0 %. The efficiency of discolouring the tested solutions also increases with the change of the surface charge of organo-zeolites from negative to positive(Fig. 3 B). The efficiency of removing the colour by using the natural tuff was improved from η= 33. 0 % to η = 40. 0 %, and by using the organo-zeolite with loading of L = 0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA to η= 76. 3 %. In order for the biodegradation of the processes effluents to be tested, the rations of BOD 5 /COD are predetermined (Figs. 4 A and 4 B). According to literature data, the good value of biodegradation is the ratio of BOD 5 /COD higher than 0. 5. The tested effluent was characterized as having particularly poor biodegradation. After processing the effluent with coagulation and organo-zeolite (0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA), the biodegradation has not shown significant improvement. It could be concluded that HDTMA-modified clinoptilolite tuff can be used for discolouring and purification of the examined wastewater in one part of wastewater treatment which combines and some other physicochemical and/or biological purification methods...|$|R

Zbog toga je za obradu takvih efluenata često potrebno integrirati različite dostupne tehnološke procese i metode pročišćavanja. Jedna od alternativnih metoda je sorpcija onečišćavača na modificiranu hidrofilnu ili hidrofobnu vanjsku mineralnu površinu. Ovaj rad obuhvaća konvencionalni proces predobrade koagulacijom s aluminijevim kloridom heksahidratom, AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O i primjenu HDTMA-Br [C 16 H 33 (CH 3) 3 N+ Br-] modificiranog klinoptilolitnog tufa kao sorbensa za poboljšanje učinkovitosti pročišćavanja efluenta proizvodnje drvenjače. Otpadna voda tretirana je uzorcima klinoptilolitnog tufa opterećenih s L = 0, 074 do 0, 204 mmol g- 1 HDTMA. Od ispitivanih modificiranih uzoraka u reakciji s otpadnom vodom, najdjelotvornijim se pokazao uzorak organo- zeolita koji je maksimalno opterećen heksadeciltrimetilamonijevim kationima u obliku dvosloja. Dodatak modificiranog uzorka klinoptilolitnog tufa s masenim udjelom od w = 1, 0 % u filtrat dobiven nakon procesa koagulacije, poboljšao je učinkovitost smanjenja kemijske potrošnje kisika od 54, 0 % na 65, 0 %, ukupnog organskog ugljika od 23, 0 % na 40, 0 % te boje od 33, 0 % na 77, 0 %. HDTMA-modificirani klinoptilolitni tuf može se upotrijebiti za obezbojenje i pročišćavanje ispitivane otpadne vode u složenom tehnološkom postupku koji uključuje i neke druge fizikalno-kemijske i/ili biološke metode pročišćavanja.
