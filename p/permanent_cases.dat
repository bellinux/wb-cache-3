40|$|Introduction Hypothyroidism is a {{significant}} but an under-appreciated complication of hemithyroidectomy. The focus {{of this study was}} to assess the incidence of hypothyroidism occurring after hemithyroidectomy, identify the risk factors and to suggest a possible follow-up guideline for diagnosis. Materials and Methods An institution based preliminary study was conducted in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, in a tertiary care hospital, from August 2014 to December 2015 on 25 patients. The patients were regularly followed up in 1 st month, 3 rd month, 6 th month, 9 th month and 1 year period with the thyroid function test. Results Incidence of hypothyroidism occurring after hemithyroidectomy including transient and <b>permanent</b> <b>cases</b> is 32 %. Increased age of presentation, longer duration of thyroid swelling, pre-operative serum TSH level > 2. 5 mIU/ml, lymphocytic infiltration in histopathology and right sided hemithyroidectomy were found to be the possible risk factors. Conclusion It is indicated from this preliminary report that there should be a serial thyroid function monitoring in every post-operative hemithyroidectomy patient, and special attention should be given to the risk grou...|$|E
40|$|Background: Thyroid {{absorption}} of iodine could be encumbered by nitrate drinking water {{when it is}} transported to the fetal thyroid gland. Therefore, nitrate potentially causes congenital hypothyroidism (CH) due to thyroid dysfunction. In this study, we have not only aimed at spatial determination of CH distribution and nitrate concentration (NC) existing in drinking water, but also we intended to evaluate the probable impact of nitrate on CH incidence. Methods: Annual average of nitrate in drinking-water as well as number of CH infants diagnosed through the screening program were applied to determine the incidence ratio of the disease for each town (from 2010 to 2013). Afterward, Arc GIS 9. 3 was used to draw choropleth maps with quantile classification. Data were entered into SPSS 16. 0 and Excel 2010 software. Finally, linear regression was applied for data analysis. Results: The incidence rate of CH (considering transient and <b>permanent</b> <b>cases)</b> was about one in every 413 births. Khansar, Golpaygan, Naein, and Ardestan had the highest incidence rate of CH respectively. On the other hand, Tiran, Dehaghan, Khansar, and Fereydan had {{the highest level of}} nitrate drinking water. There was a strong relationship between the NC and incidence of CH in Khansar; however, this relationship was not significant (P = 0. 392) in Isfahan province. Conclusions: Since there was not a significant relationship between NC in drinking-water and incidence of CH through linear regression analysis, more studies should be implemented to confirm or refute our observations...|$|E
40|$|Tuberculosis {{infection}} {{may remain}} latent, but {{the disease is}} nevertheless a serious public health issue. Various epidemiological studies on pulmonary tuberculosis have considered the spatial component and taken it into account, revealing the tendency of this disease to cluster in particular locations. The aim {{was to assess the}} contribution of Knowledge Attitude and Practice (KAP) to the distribution of tuberculosis and to provide information for the improvement of the National Tuberculosis Program. We investigated the role of KAP to distribution patterns of pulmonary tuberculosis in Antananarivo. First, we performed spatial scanning of tuberculosis aggregation among <b>permanent</b> <b>cases</b> resident in Antananarivo Urban Township using the Kulldorff method, and then we carried out a quantitative study on KAP, involving TB patients. The KAP study in the population was based on qualitative methods with focus groups. The disease still clusters in the same districts identified in the previous study. The principal cluster covered 22 neighborhoods. Most of them are part of the first district. A secondary cluster was found, involving 18 neighborhoods in the sixth district and two neighborhoods in the fifth. The relative risk was respectively 1. 7 (p< 10 - 6) in the principal cluster and 1. 6 (p< 10 - 3) in the secondary cluster. Our study showed that more was known about TB symptoms than about the duration of the disease or free treatment. Knowledge about TB was limited to that acquired at school or from relatives with TB. The attitude and practices of patients and the population in general indicated that there is still a stigma attached to tuberculosis. This type of survey can be conducted in remote zones where the tuberculosis-related KAP of the TB patients and the general population is less known or not documented; the findings could be used to adapt control measures to the local particularities...|$|E

40|$|Lacrimal sac {{diverticulum}} {{is a rare}} condition {{characterized by}} a cystic structure communicating with the sac. This abnormality may be directly demonstrated by dacryocystography only in a few cases; in the remaining cases, preoperative diagnosis may be arduous. We report 3 cases of lacrimal sac diverticulum. In all patients, symptoms were represented by a palpable mass in the lacrimal sac region, associated with <b>permanent</b> (<b>case</b> 1) or episodic (cases 2 and 3) epiphora. In the first case, CT-dacryocystography revealed an apparently solid mass causing inferior lacrimal obstruction, and ultrasonography disclosed a cystic space, not communicating with the sac. At surgery, a sac diverticulum was identified and excised. In the second patient, CT showed a homogeneous rounded mass, whereas a cystic character was revealed by T 1 -weighted MRI. Dacryocystography showed a lateral impression on the lateral wall of the sac. Ultrasonography revealed a cystic space communicating with the lacrimal sac. In the third case, ultrasonography demonstrated a diverticulum. CT is often unable to discriminate tumors from lacrimal cysts, both showing a parenchymal density. MRI can differentiate lacrimal cystic spaces from solid tumors by T 1 intensity and by demonstration of their walls, but it is nonspecific for diverticula. Only dacryocystography and B-scan ultrasonography can reveal the narrow communication between the sac and the diverticulum. Observation is the recommended management for asymptomatic case...|$|R
