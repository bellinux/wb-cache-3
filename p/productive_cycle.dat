50|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{specific}} data about the <b>productive</b> <b>cycle</b> of papillomaviruses. Research is not conclusive about which coding regions are expressed before or after replication of viral DNA. The E1 region should carried the DNA required for cis and/or trans. E1 is the largest Open reading frame, which is the set of codons in the genome that code for proteins, encoding a 602 base protein. E1 is similar to COOH-terminal domain of the Simian virus 40, plays a role in viral DNA replication maintaining plasmids within a cell. Results have found that CRPV and BPV1 are found in the same location of the genome, which is indicates that papillomaviruses likely have similar methods of replicating their genomes outside of a chromosome. Notable difference between the genomes of the four strains is that the E6 protein is almost twice as long in the CRPV as in any of the other strains of papillomaviruses. The E6 protein is somewhat homologous with a family of ATP synthases that are found in mitochondria of cattle. The homology is significant enough to imply an evolutionary relationship between E6 and the beta chain of the ATP synthase family, however {{they do not have the}} same function or enzyme activity. The E2 protein overlaps with the E4 open reading frames in the other papillomaviruses. These differences in the E2 proteins likely determine how oncogenic a virus is. The noncoding region has a homologies with BPV1. Other homologies exist, such as the fact that all papillomaviruses have repeated sequences in the noncoding parts of their genomes. CRPV has some notable repeats, some as long as 32 base pairs. Many pairs up stream of the transcription locations are homologous with promoter sequences in of SV40.|$|E

We have previously identified the cellular NACos (nuclear and adherent junction complex components) protein ubinuclein (Ubn- 1) as a partner for EB 1, but the function of this complex has never been studied. Here, we have evaluated the consequences of this interaction on the EBV <b>productive</b> <b>cycle</b> and find that Ubn- 1 overexpression represses the EBV <b>productive</b> <b>cycle</b> whereas Ubn- 1 downregulation by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) increases virus production. By a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we show that Ubn- 1 blocks EB 1 -DNA interaction.

We found that SUMO 2 / 3 conjugates accumulate during the late phase of the <b>productive</b> virus <b>cycle,</b> and identified several viral proteins as bone fide SUMOylation substrates. Analysis of the mechanism involved in the accumulation of SUMOylated proteins revealed upregulation of several components of the SUMO-conjugation machinery and post-transcriptional downregulation of the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase RNF 4. The latter effect was mediated by selective inhibition of RNF 4 protein expression by the viral miR-BHRF 1 - 1. Reconstitution of RNF 4 in cells expressing an inducible miR-BHRF 1 - 1 sponge or a miR-BHRF 1 - 1 resistant RNF 4 was associated with reduced levels of early and late viral proteins and impaired virus release.

This study estimated Brazil’s oil production curves, according to different URR scenarios (P 95, P 50 and P 5), applying a modified multi-Hubbert model. This model improved the classic methodology by adding <b>productive</b> <b>cycles</b> and allowing the revision of the assumption that production rate is strictly proportional to the first power of both depletion and information effects.
