5|$|George Smith {{established}} a second distillery during 1849, named the Cairngorm-Delnabo Distillery but by 1855 or 1856, both distilleries were running at full capacity, and {{were unable to}} meet rising demand. The operation of two separate sites was also proving difficult and expensive, so plans were formed {{around the same time}} to build a new, larger distillery further down the hill at Minmore. Construction of this new distillery was underway when the old Upper Drumin distillery was destroyed by fire during 1858. Construction of the new Minmore distillery was sped up and salvageable equipment from the Upper Drumin distillery was transferred to the new Mimmore distillery. The Delnabo distillery was closed {{at the same time and}} the best parts of the equipment were also transferred to the Minmore <b>plant.</b> <b>Production</b> commenced at the new plant during 1859 and it was around the same time the legal entity of George & J.G. Smith, Ltd. was formed.|$|E
5|$|Soil is {{the living}} {{top layer of}} mineral and organic dirt that covers {{the surface of the}} planet. It is the chief {{organizing}} centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The decomposition of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing minerals and nutrients that feed into <b>plant</b> <b>production.</b> The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the pedosphere where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the detritivores that regulate soil formation. Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called bioturbation. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil microorganisms are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils. Paleoecological studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other events, such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the Devonian period {{played a significant role in}} the early development of ecological trophism in soils.|$|E

25|$|Animals {{that feed}} on grain or rely on grazing require more water than grain crops. Producing 1kg of meat {{requires}} up to 15,000 liters of water. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), growing crops for farm animals requires {{nearly half of}} the US water supply and 80% of its agricultural land. Animals raised for food in the US consume 90% of the soy crop, 80% of the corn crop, and 70% of its grain. However, where an extensive farming system (as opposed to a feedlot) is used, some water and nutrients are returned to the soil to provide a benefit to the pasture. This cycling and processing of water and nutrients is less prevalent in most <b>plant</b> <b>production</b> systems, so may bring the efficiency rate of animal production closer to the efficiency of plant based agricultural systems. In tracking food animal production from the feed through to the dinner table, the inefficiencies of meat, milk, and egg production range from a 4:1 energy input to protein output ratio up to 54:1. The result is that producing animal-based food is typically much less efficient than the harvesting of grains, vegetables, legumes, seeds, and fruits.|$|E

500|$|In June 1952, two lecturers in {{veterinary}} {{science at}} the University of Sydney, Doug Blood and Jim Steel, {{wrote a letter to}} the Australian Veterinary Journal complaining of their university's placement of animal husbandry as a subordinate topic within veterinary science. [...] They argued that the field of animal husbandry included [...] "the procurement of maximum production from the available animals, compatible with their continued health and the maintenance of the natural resources of the land on which they live" [...] and was worthy of its own profession. [...] McClymont saw the letter and responded with his own missive to the journal in June 1953. [...] In his letter, McClymont opined that the field in question should instead be called [...] "animal production" [...] and that it should, [...] "be defined as the integration of animal husbandry and agronomy (the science of pasture and crop production), or in more general terms, manipulation of the soil-plant-animal complex, for the purpose of economic production of animal products." [...] He added that the university-level training in the field should include, [...] "extension work, research, and commercial applications." [...] McClymont concluded that university graduates in such a field of study would be prepared to blend veterinary (animal) and agricultural (<b>plant)</b> <b>production</b> sciences to optimize farm animal output.|$|E
500|$|An initial study {{published}} in 1988 by a researcher from Oak Ridge National Laboratory demonstrated the then-current population of 180 horses was over-grazing the island. The researcher recommended reducing the herd size to between 49 and 73 animals, which she contended was the maximum size that the island could support without environmental damage. The study showed that the horses were significantly reducing plant stocks on the island, and reducing future <b>plant</b> <b>production</b> due to trampling. A 1991 study of genetic variation in feral horse herds on eastern US barrier islands was conducted by researchers from the University of Georgia and University of Kentucky. The study concluded that a herd of 122 was the minimum size necessary to prevent inbreeding. The researchers noted {{that they were looking}} at herd size solely as it related to genetic variation, and did not take environmental damage into consideration. In addition, it was found that due to the large amount of introduced blood from outside horses, the Cumberland Island horses were not genetically unique. Due to this, and the ongoing environmental damage, it was concluded that the horses met neither the genetic nor the environmental requirements for feral horses on public lands, and that the herd should be reduced or removed completely. The researchers conceded, however, that their analysis did not take [...] "local historical and cultural elements" [...] into consideration, only environmental and genetic.|$|E

2500|$|Managed {{intensive}} {{rotational grazing}} paints a wide brush over many different managed grazing systems. Managers {{have found that}} rotational grazing systems can work for diverse management purposes, but scientific experiments have demonstrated that rotational grazing systems do not always necessarily work for specific ecological purposes. [...] This controversy stems from two main categorical differences in rotational grazing, prescribed management and adaptive management. [...] The performance of rangeland grazing strategies are similarly constrained by several ecological variables establishing that differences among them are dependent {{on the effectiveness of}} those management models. Depending on the management model, <b>plant</b> <b>production</b> {{has been shown to be}} equal or greater in continuous compared to rotational grazing in 87% of the experiments.|$|E

40|$|Crude {{glycerol}} is the {{byproduct of}} biodiesel <b>production</b> <b>plant</b> {{and the economic}} value of glycerol may affect the profitability of the biodiesel <b>production</b> <b>plant.</b> As the <b>production</b> rate of bioglycerol increases, its market values drop considerably. Therefore, conversion of bioglycerol into value-added products can reduce the overall cost, hence, leading to a more economical biodiesel <b>production</b> <b>plant.</b> In a direct carboxylation reaction, CO 2 reacts with glycerol to produce glycerol carbonate and water. This study presents a direct comparison of the economic analysis of the conventional biodiesel <b>production</b> <b>plant</b> and the possible next generation biodiesel-glycerol carbonate <b>production</b> <b>plant.</b> At the end of 15 -year project, the net present value of the biodiesel-glycerol carbonate <b>production</b> <b>plant</b> is $ 13. 21 million higher than the conventional biodiesel plant.
