This pilot project utilizes the University of Maine's patent-pending VolturnUS, a floating concrete hull technology can support wind turbines in water depths of 45 meters or more. The {{objective of the}} pilot is to demonstrate the technology at full scale, allowing floating farms to be built out-of-sight across the US and {{the world in the}} 2020s.

40|$|The use of <b>project</b> <b>partnering</b> is {{becoming}} more frequent in Australian Government construction projects because of the potential benefits that can be achieved from the effective implementation of the <b>project</b> <b>partnering</b> arrangement. Despite this, <b>project</b> <b>partnering</b> is not always successful. The aim {{of this paper is to}} identify the problematic issues associated with <b>project</b> <b>partnering</b> based on contractors' perceptions. Fifteen problematic issues were identified from six contractors involved in unsuccessful <b>project</b> <b>partnering</b> relationships. The results indicate that the unwillingness of the client to fully commit to the partnering agreement was the main reason for ineffective <b>project</b> <b>partnering.</b> There is a need for the public clients to adapt more flexible administrative procedures in order to improve contractors' willingness to commit to <b>project</b> <b>partnering</b> arrangements. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and IPMA.

40|$|<b>Project</b> <b>partnering</b> {{has gained}} {{popularity}} in the Hong Kong construction industry since its adoption on the North District Hospital project in 1994. An increasing trend {{in the use of}} <b>project</b> <b>partnering</b> in building and construction has been observed over the past decade, with a proven track record of success. In order to critically investigate and examine the effectiveness and performance of <b>project</b> <b>partnering</b> as applied in the local building and construction industry, the Construction Industry Institute, Hong Kong (CII-HK) initiated an industry-driven research study in March 2003 to compare the implementation and outcomes of <b>project</b> <b>partnering</b> practices amongst the public, private and infrastructure sectors as well as between building and infrastructure works. This paper summarizes the key findings derived from the CII-HK funded research study completed in late 2004. Based on the case study of six selected projects, a 'best practice' partnering framework is developed. While it has been demonstrated that <b>project</b> <b>partnering</b> can provide extensive benefits to the industry across different sectors, {{it should be noted that}} partnering is not a panacea to solve all kinds of problems. What it does is to provide an avenue for people to communicate better thus eliminating unnecessary misunderstanding. It is recommended that partnering be adopted across a wider spectrum of the construction industry during the 21 st Century to reap sustainable benefits for construction excellence.

40|$|Over time, partnering {{initiatives}} have {{been characterized by}} increasing formalization and involvement of {{a wider range of}} actors, but there {{does not seem to be}} a clear trend that <b>project</b> <b>partnering</b> is replaced by long term relations. In this paper, we discuss which factors influence the development of strategic and <b>project</b> <b>partnering</b> respectively, as well as trends in managing integrated teamwork. The empirical basis is three case studies: two of <b>project</b> <b>partnering</b> relationships and one of a long term long term partnership involving a network of suppliers. We find that partnering models and performance are shaped both by project management and by factors in the project environment. Long term relations supplier have to be skilfully managed to be an attractive alternative to <b>project</b> <b>partnering</b> in a market where general partnering competence is high. Also, in the management of complex collaborative relationships, a key challenge is to balance the benefits of including as much competence as possible with the restrictions of creating meeting places for meaningful knowledge exchange. Further, with increasing maturity partnering may more often be used to change power relations and bring in critical perspectives, thereby calling for other types of conflict management than those relating to contractual disagreements...|$|R
