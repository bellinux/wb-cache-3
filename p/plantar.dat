5|$|Disruptions in the <b>plantar</b> fascia's normal {{mechanical}} movement during standing and walking (known as the Windlass mechanism) {{are thought to}} {{contribute to the development of}} <b>plantar</b> fasciitis by placing excess strain on the calcaneal tuberosity. Other studies have also suggested that <b>plantar</b> fasciitis is not actually due to inflamed <b>plantar</b> fascia, but may be a tendon injury involving the flexor digitorum brevis muscle located immediately deep to the <b>plantar</b> fascia.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{this shift}} in thought about the {{underlying}} mechanisms in <b>plantar</b> fasciitis, many in the academic community have stated the condition should be renamed <b>plantar</b> fasciosis. The structural breakdown of the <b>plantar</b> fascia {{is believed to be}} the result of repetitive microtrauma (small tears). Microscopic examination of the <b>plantar</b> fascia often shows myxomatous degeneration, connective tissue calcium deposits, and disorganized collagen fibers.|$|E
5|$|If the <b>plantar</b> fascia {{continues}} to be overused {{in the setting of}} <b>plantar</b> fasciitis, the <b>plantar</b> fascia can rupture. Typical signs and symptoms of <b>plantar</b> fascia rupture include a clicking or snapping sound, significant local swelling, and acute pain in the sole of the foot.|$|E
5|$|Originally, <b>plantar</b> {{fasciitis}} {{was believed}} to be an inflammatory condition of the <b>plantar</b> fascia. However, within the last decade, studies have observed microscopic anatomical changes indicating that <b>plantar</b> fasciitis is actually due to a noninflammatory structural breakdown of the <b>plantar</b> fascia rather than an inflammatory process.|$|E
5|$|An {{incidental}} finding {{associated with}} this condition is a heel spur, a small bony calcification on the calcaneus (heel bone), {{which can be found}} in up to 50% of those with <b>plantar</b> fasciitis. In such cases, it is the underlying <b>plantar</b> fasciitis that produces the heel pain, and not the spur itself. The condition is responsible for the creation of the spur though the clinical significance of heel spurs in <b>plantar</b> fasciitis remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Identified {{risk factors}} for <b>plantar</b> {{fasciitis}} include excessive running, standing on hard surfaces for prolonged periods of time, high arches of the feet, {{the presence of a}} leg length inequality, and flat feet. The tendency of flat feet to excessively roll inward during walking or running makes them more susceptible to <b>plantar</b> fasciitis. Obesity is seen in 70% of individuals who present with <b>plantar</b> fasciitis and is an independent risk factor.|$|E
5|$|A {{determination}} about {{a diagnosis}} of <b>plantar</b> fasciitis can usually be made based on a person's medical history and physical examination.|$|E
5|$|Normally the <b>plantar</b> fascia {{has three}} {{fascicle}}s {{with the central}} fascicle thickest at 4mm, the lateral fascicle at 2mm and the medial at less than a millimeter in thickness. In theory, the likeliness of fasciitis increases with increasing thickness of <b>plantar</b> fascia at the calcaneal insertion, with thickness of more than 4.5mm being somewhat useful on ultrasound and 4mm on MRI. Findings on imaging such as <b>plantar</b> aponeurosis thickening, however, may be absent in symptomatic individuals or present in asymptomatic individuals thereby limiting the utility of such observations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Plantar</b> {{fasciitis}} {{is usually}} diagnosed by {{a health care}} provider after consideration of a person's presenting history, risk factors, and clinical examination. Tenderness to palpation along the inner aspect of the heel bone on the {{sole of the foot}} may be elicited during the physical examination. The foot may have limited dorsiflexion due to tightness of the calf muscles or the Achilles tendon. Dorsiflexion of the foot may elicit the pain due to stretching of the <b>plantar</b> fascia with this motion. Diagnostic imaging studies are not usually needed to diagnose <b>plantar</b> fasciitis. However, in certain cases a physician may decide imaging studies (such as X-rays, diagnostic ultrasound or MRI) are warranted to rule out serious causes of foot pain.|$|E
5|$|Studies have {{suggested}} a strong association exists between an increased {{body mass index}} {{and the development of}} <b>plantar</b> fasciitis in the non-athletic population; this association between weight and <b>plantar</b> fasciitis has not been observed in the athletic population. Achilles tendon tightness and inappropriate footwear have also been identified as significant risk factors.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} <b>plantar</b> {{fasciitis}} is poorly understood and {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The <b>plantar</b> fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from the medial tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along the {{sole of the foot}} before inserting {{at the base of the}} toes, and supports the arch of the foot.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} <b>plantar</b> {{fasciitis}} {{are not entirely}} clear. Risk factors include overuse such as from long periods of standing, an increase in exercise, and obesity. It is also associated with inward rolling of the foot and a lifestyle that involves little exercise. While heel spurs are frequently found it is unclear {{if they have a}} role in causing the condition. <b>Plantar</b> fasciitis is a disorder of the insertion site of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring. As inflammation plays a lesser role, many feel the condition should be renamed <b>plantar</b> fasciosis. The diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms with ultrasound sometimes used to help. Other conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis.|$|E
5|$|It is {{typically}} thought {{to affect the}} big toe, but it affects {{other parts of the}} feet as well, including the bottom of the foot (<b>plantar</b> surface). The occurrence of purple toe syndrome may require discontinuation of warfarin.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} {{patch of}} {{hair on the}} central pad of their hind paws marks <b>plantar</b> glands that give off a distinctive odor. Since these patches become enlarged during breeding season, they are likely {{used to make a}} scent trail to allow fishers to find each other so that they can mate.|$|E
5|$|Between 4% and 7% {{of people}} have heel pain {{at any given time}} and about 80% of these cases are due to <b>plantar</b> fasciitis. Approximately 10% {{of people have}} the {{disorder}} at some point during their life. It becomes more common with age. It is unclear if one sex is more affected than the other.|$|E
5|$|Medical imaging is not {{routinely}} {{needed as}} it is expensive and does not typically change how <b>plantar</b> fasciitis is managed. When the diagnosis is not clinically apparent, lateral view x-rays of the ankle are the recommended imaging modality to assess for other causes of heel pain such as stress fractures or bone spur development.|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} <b>plantar</b> {{fasciitis}} resolve {{with time and}} conservative methods of treatment. Usually {{for the first few}} weeks people are advised to rest, change their activities, take pain medications, and stretch. If this is not sufficient physiotherapy, orthotics, splinting, or steroid injections may be options. If other measures do not work extracorporeal shockwave therapy or surgery may be tried.|$|E
5|$|As a freshman, Cabral {{endured a}} <b>plantar</b> fascia tear while waterskiing {{and did not}} compete in cross country. He did not compete in the steeplechase until his sophomore season at Princeton. In his second time running the event, he won at the 2010 Penn Relays. That year he was the Ivy League outdoor 10,000 meter and steeplechase {{champion}} and the indoor runner-up in the 3000 meters and 5000 meters. He finished second at the NCAA championships {{with a time of}} 8:38.90.|$|E
5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the <b>plantar</b> reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E
5|$|<b>Plantar</b> {{fasciitis}} is {{a disorder}} {{that results in}} pain in the heel {{and bottom of the}} foot. The pain is usually most severe with the first steps of the day or following a period of rest. Pain is also frequently brought on by bending the foot and toes up towards the shin and may be worsened by a tight Achilles tendon. The condition typically comes on slowly. In about a third of people both legs are affected.|$|E
5|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for heel pain is extensive and includes pathological entities including, {{but not limited}} to the following: calcaneal stress fracture, calcaneal bursitis, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis involving the nerve roots of lumbar spinal nerve 5 (L5) or sacral spinal nerve 1 (S1), calcaneal fat pad syndrome, hypothyroidism, seronegative spondyloparthopathies such as reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or rheumatoid arthritis (more likely if pain is present in both heels), <b>plantar</b> fascia rupture, and compression neuropathies such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or impingement of the medial calcaneal nerve.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi is a {{medium-sized}} oryzomyine with small ears and large feet, and {{is similar to}} the marsh rice rat in general appearance. The long and coarse fur is brownish above and ochraceous below. At the base of the tail, the upper and lower sides differ in color and at the end is a short tuft of hairs. The scales on the tail are well-developed. As in other Oryzomys, the hindfeet exhibit specializations for life in the water. The <b>plantar</b> (lower) surface of the metatarsus is naked. Two of the pads are very small. Ungual tufts, tufts of hair at the bases of the claws, are poorly developed. Interdigital webbing is present, but extends along {{less than half of the}} first phalanges.|$|E
5|$|Other diagnoses {{that are}} {{typically}} considered include fractures, tumors, or systemic disease if <b>plantar</b> fasciitis pain fails to respond appropriately to conservative medical treatments. Bilateral heel pain or heel {{pain in the}} context of a systemic illness may indicate a need for a more in-depth diagnostic investigation. Under these circumstances, diagnostic tests such as a CBC or serological markers of inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, HLA-B27, uric acid, or Lyme disease antibodies may also be obtained. Neurological deficits may prompt an investigation with electromyography to evaluate for damage to the nerves or muscles.|$|E
5|$|During the 2005–06 season, Duncan {{suffered}} from <b>plantar</b> fasciitis {{for most of}} the season, which was at least partly responsible for his sinking output (18.6 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 blocks per game), and also for his failure to make the All-NBA First Team after eight consecutive appearances. The big man came back strong in the 2006 NBA Playoffs against the Dallas Mavericks, where he outscored rival power forward Dirk Nowitzki 32.2 to 27.1 points, with neither Nowitzki nor Mavericks center Erick Dampier able to stop Duncan with their man-to-man defense. But after splitting the first six games, Duncan became the tragic hero of his team in Game 7. Despite scoring 39 points in regulation time and fouling out both Dampier and Keith Van Horn, Duncan only made one of seven field goal attempts in overtime against Mavericks reserve center DeSagana Diop, and the Spurs lost Game 7.|$|E
25|$|The opponens digiti minimi {{originates}} {{from the}} long <b>plantar</b> ligament and the <b>plantar</b> tendinous sheath of peroneus longus and is inserted on the fifth metatarsal. When present, it acts to <b>plantar</b> flex the fifth digit and supports the <b>plantar</b> arch. The flexor digiti minimi arises from the region of base of the fifth metatarsal and is inserted onto {{the base of the}} first phalanx of the fifth digit where it is usually merged with the abductor of the first digit. It acts to <b>plantar</b> flex the last digit. The largest and longest muscles of the little toe is the abductor digiti minimi. Stretching from the lateral process of the calcaneus, with a second attachment on the base of the fifth metatarsal, {{to the base of the}} fifth digit's first phalanx, the muscle forms the lateral edge of the sole. Except for supporting the arch, it <b>plantar</b> flexes the little toe and also acts as an abductor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plantar</b> warts {{are often}} similar to calluses or corns, {{but can be}} {{differentiated}} by close observation of skin striations. Feet are covered in skin striae, which are akin to fingerprints on the feet. Skin striae go around <b>plantar</b> warts; if the lesion is not a <b>plantar</b> wart, the striations continue across {{the top layer of}} the skin. <b>Plantar</b> warts tend to be painful on application of pressure from either side of the lesion rather than direct pressure, unlike calluses (which tend to be painful on direct pressure instead).|$|E
25|$|A <b>plantar</b> wart is a wart {{occurring}} on {{the bottom}} of the foot or toes. They are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV infections in other locations are not <b>plantar</b> warts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plantar</b> warts are not {{prevented}} by inoculation with currently available HPV vaccines because the warts {{are caused by}} different strains of HPV. Gardasil protects against strains 6, 11, 16, and 18, and Cervarix protects against 16 and 18, whereas <b>plantar</b> warts are caused by strains 1, 2, 4, and 63.|$|E
25|$|A <b>plantar</b> wart {{is a small}} lesion {{that appears}} {{on the surface of}} the skin and {{typically}} resembles a cauliflower, with tiny black petechiae (tiny hemorrhages under the skin) in the center. Pinpoint bleeding may occur when these are scratched. <b>Plantar</b> warts occur on the soles of feet and toes. They may be painful when standing or walking.|$|E
25|$|It is {{injected}} into the heel when treating <b>plantar</b> fasciitis, sometimes in conjunction with triamcinolone acetonide.|$|E
25|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{muscles of}} the foot, muscles whose bellies {{are located in the}} foot proper, are either dorsal (top) or <b>plantar</b> (sole).|$|E
25|$|The <b>plantar</b> muscles can be {{subdivided}} {{into three groups}} associated with three regions: those of the big digit, the little digit, and the region between these two. All these muscles are covered by the thick and dense <b>plantar</b> aponeurosis, which, together with two tough septa, form the spaces of the three groups. These muscles and their fatty tissue function as cushions that transmit {{the weight of the}} body downward. As a whole, the foot is a functional entity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plantar</b> flexion: One of {{the most}} popular lower leg muscle {{stretches}} is the step standing heel raises, which mainly involves the gastrocnemius, soleus, and the Achilles tendon. Standing heel raises allow the individual to activate their calf muscles by standing on a step with toes and forefoot, leaving the heel hanging off the step, and <b>plantar</b> flexing the ankle joint by raising the heel. This exercise is easily modified by holding on to a nearby rail for balance and is generally repeated 5-10 times.|$|E
25|$|Epidemiological studies {{looking at}} the most common {{injuries}} that affect fast bowlers found that 11% of injuries involve the foot and the ankle. Majority of the injuries to the feet and ankles of fast bowlers {{are a result of}} the impact of the foot planted in the delivery stride. A bowler who's forefoot in their delivery stride is a <b>plantar</b> flex action can cause posterior impingement. After long durations this <b>plantar</b> flexion can lead to the creation of a bone spur which can then be treated through surgery.|$|E
25|$|Formic acid — Topical {{formic acid}} {{is a common}} {{treatment}} for <b>plantar</b> warts, which works by being applied {{over a period of}} time causing the body to reject the wart.|$|E
25|$|Patient {{can have}} {{enthesitis}} presenting as heel pain, Achilles tendinitis or <b>plantar</b> fasciitis, along with balanitis circinata (circinate balanitis), which involves penile lesions present in roughly 20 to 40 {{percent of the}} men with the disease.|$|E
