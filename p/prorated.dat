5|$|Several {{actors were}} offered {{the role of}} Judah Ben-Hur before it was {{accepted}} by Charlton Heston. Burt Lancaster stated he turned down the role because he found the script boring and belittling to Christianity. Paul Newman turned it down because he said he didn't have the legs to wear a tunic. Marlon Brando, Rock Hudson, Geoffrey Horne, and Leslie Nielsen were also offered the role, as {{were a number of}} muscular, handsome Italian actors (many of whom did not speak English). Kirk Douglas was interested in the role, but was turned down in favor of Heston, who was formally cast on January 22, 1958. His salary was $250,000 for 30 weeks, a <b>prorated</b> salary for any time over 30 weeks, and travel expenses for his family.|$|E
5|$|Toll plazas {{are located}} along the South Bay Expressway at all {{northbound}} onramps and southbound offramps; {{there is also}} a mainline Otay Mesa Toll Plaza {{at the southern end of}} the facility just north of Otay Mesa Road. The toll road is equipped with the FasTrak electronic toll collection system, with drivers being charged a <b>prorated</b> toll based on the distance traveled. Those paying by cash or credit card are instead charged a more expensive flat rate depending on which toll booth they pass through, using a barrier toll system. For example, any cash- or credit-paying driver that passes through the Otay Mesa Toll Plaza ends up paying $3.50 regardless of the distance they actually traveled.|$|E

25|$|While {{this meant}} that Redden (along with Scott Gomez of the Montreal Canadiens, {{who was in a}} similar situation) would still have been paid his <b>prorated</b> 2012–13 salary despite not playing, the NHL Players' Association (NHLPA) was {{concerned}} that for Redden and Gomez to be forced to spend an entire year away from hockey would adversely affect their ability to find employment elsewhere in the NHL during the 2013 off-season, even at a much reduced salary. On January 15, in order to avoid this process, the CBA was revised to allow teams to use one of their two compliance buyouts {{prior to the start of}} the shortened 2012–13 season, with the provision that the players bought-out in such a way would still be paid their <b>prorated</b> but otherwise full 2012–13 salaries (which would still count against the 2012–13 cap), and with the buyout of the subsequent years otherwise proceeding as originally intended.|$|E

25|$|The old age pension program, {{insurance}} equally {{financed by}} employers and workers, {{was designed to}} provide a pension annuity for workers who reached the age of 70. Unlike the accident and sickness insurance programs, this program covered all categories of workers (industrial, agrarian, artisans and servants) from the start. Also, unlike the other two programs, the principle that the national government should contribute a portion of the underwriting cost, with the other two portions <b>prorated</b> accordingly, was accepted without question. The disability insurance program was intended to be used by those permanently disabled. This time, the state or province supervised the programs directly.|$|E

50|$|In the past, {{the family}} of Scenopinidae {{included}} only the current subfamily of Scenopininae, while the other genera known at that time were classified into different systematic positions. <b>Prorates</b> was described and classified by Melander (1906) among Empididae and Caenotus was described and classified by Cole (1923)among Therevidae. Subsequently taxonomist took different views. Currently <b>Prorates</b> Melander, Alloxytropus Bezzi, Caenotus Cole, and Caenotoides Hall (formerly the <b>Prorates</b> group) of the Bombyliidae subfamily Proratinae are seen as sharing apomorphies with the Scenopinidae. The Scenopinidae are divided into three subfamilies: the Caenotinae, containing Caenotus; the Proratinae containing Alloxytropus, Caenotoides, and Prorates; and the Scenopininae. An exception is Apystomyia Melander, which does not exhibit {{a relationship with the}} Scenopinidae and it is considered incertae sedis at the family level within the Muscomorpha.|$|R
25|$|The {{jurisdictional}} issue proved highly complex. First, the Court had {{to confront}} {{how much of the}} work was done outside the state of West Virginia, and, second, it had to determine whether the work on the river constituted the territory of West Virginia. In determining the latter, the Court had to investigate whether work occurred on the river bed, on federal property adjacent to the river, or on private property leased by the corporation to accommodate its work for the federal government. Relying heavily on Hans Rees' Sons, Inc. v. North Carolina, 283 U.S. 123 (1931), Hughes concluded that the tax must be <b>prorated</b> to cover only that work performed within the borders of West Virginia.|$|E

Now, each NBA team can sign two players to contracts that allow them to assign the players to the G League without risk of being [...] "poached" [...] by another NBA team. The players signed to such deals benefit by receiving a considerably higher salary than other G League players while in that league, as well as earning a <b>prorated</b> share of the NBA minimum rookie salary for each day they are with their contracted NBA team. Salaries of two-way players are not included in salary cap calculations. Additionally, a team can convert a two-way contract to a standard NBA contract at any time, with the player's salary becoming the NBA minimum for the player's years of service, <b>prorated</b> {{from the time of the}} conversion; a converted contract also does not count in cap calculations.|$|E

This implies that despite deregulation, the agricultural marketing sector was unable to exercise market power and maintain retail orange prices high while depressing grower prices, as some growers claimed. In addition, the results suggest that shortrun distributor reaction to a permanent termination of marketing order controls would result in changes in marketing system behavior which would be favorable to consumers...|$|R

After pitching in a second round loss to Mexico that eliminated the United States, Clemens began considering a return to the major leagues. On May 31, 2006, following another extended period of speculation, it was announced that Clemens was coming out of retirement for the third time to pitch for the Astros {{for the remainder of the}} 2006 season. Clemens signed a contract worth $22,000,022 (his uniform number is #22).

Playing in his first game back with the Devils since 1990–91, he scored the first goal of the game against the Nashville Predators on a 5-on-3 power play by toe dragging the puck around the opposition player and then shooting it on the pad side on January 19 in a 3–1 win. On August 5, 2009, Shanahan agreed to a one-year deal with the Devils returning for a 22nd season, to play during the 2009–10 season. This would have been Shanahan's sixth season as a Devil. However, on October 1, 2009, the Devils and Shanahan parted ways, with Shanahan saying, [...] "When I signed this past summer, Lou Lamoriello, Jacques Lemaire and I agreed that if we were unable to find a suitable fit in which I would be able to compete and contribute at the level I expect from myself, then I would simply step aside."
