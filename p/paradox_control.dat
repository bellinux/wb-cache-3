40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to present}} {{selected}} {{findings of a}} recent study of serendipity in information seeking, exploring the <b>paradox</b> of <b>control</b> inherent in the concept of "seeking serendipity". Design/methodology/approach - After providing an overview of the research study, the paper locates the research findings {{in the context of the}} literature. The discussion explores the research findings in relation to both the <b>paradox</b> of <b>control</b> and the related concept of "seeking serendipity". Findings - The definition/ description of serendipity is examined, the concept of process-perception duality is introduced, and links with the literature are explored. The discussion reassesses the <b>paradox</b> of <b>control</b> in light of the research findings, raising the possibility that information literacy educators have a role to play in developing the perception aspect of serendipity. Practical implications - The paper proposes that, despite the possibly uncomfortable challenges presented by the <b>paradox</b> of <b>control,</b> serendipity deserves more recognition in professional practice. Increased acknowledgement and understanding of serendipity may enable professional practitioners to function more effectively in the unpredictable, dynamic environment that informs the reality of information seeking. Originality/value - The paper adds to the limited existing empirical research investigating serendipity, increasing both academic and practical understanding of the phenomenon. In particular, the introduction of the concept of process-perception duality provides a useful grounding for future research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R

Flow theory and its model indicate that these two variables have to be understood dynamically, and considered simultaneously, to estimate the state and level of Optimal Experience. Flow theory and its model are based upon {{the premise that the}} level of Perceived Challenge and Perceived Skill are resultants from the psychological and behavioral responses from the Optimal Arousal Seeking Drive, which has intensity and direction. However, previous research in the field of adventure tourism has not considered these two variables as Drives, and has only considered either Perceived Challenge, or Perceived Skill separately. To date these two variables have not been considered simultaneously. It is the purpose of this research to examine the influence of the levels of Perceived Challenge and Skill on Optimal Experience in Adventure Tourism Participants within the snowboarder population. The results indicate Perceived Challenge level significantly influence on Concentration, Merging of Action & Awareness, Transformation of Time, and <b>Paradox</b> of <b>Control</b> factors among Optimal Experience.

Twenty-eight elite-level athletes, representing 7 sports, were interviewed on their perceptions of flow state during performance of their sport. Csikszentmihalyi’s (1990) model of the flow state was examined for its applicability to elite athletes. Correspondence was found between the dimensions of flow, as described, by Csikszentmihalyi (1990), and the athletes descriptions of their experience of flow; some dimensions received greater support through the qualitative analysis of the athletes’ descriptions than did other dimensions. Those dimensions of flow most represented across the group’s data were the autotelic experience of flow, total concentration on the task at hand, merging of action and awareness, and the <b>paradox</b> of <b>control.</b> The analyses provided a detailed, sport-specific picture of flow state in elite athletes...|$|R

This tension leads to complex interactions between platform owners and third parties as they negotiate the extent and nature of innovation. This paper outlines on-going research that applies structural narrative analysis in order to simplify these complex interactions into sequences of simpler generic generative and controlling actions. It is intended that these simplified structured sequences of actions will facilitate the identification of the mechanisms that explain how platform owners manage innovation and the <b>paradox</b> of <b>control</b> and generativity. The approach to analysis is illustrated using empirical data concerning interactions that have occurred on the Apple iPhone and Google Android platforms.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{paper is to}} offer an {{understanding}} of home hospice from a perspective of political geography. Informed by critical political theories of care, and recent work on the geographies {{of public and private}} spheres, I explore one set of consequences of the spatial shift towards home death in metropolitan Seattle, Washington. Terminal hospice care done in the home creates an especially paradoxical home space. By blurring public - private boundaries, hospice care produces a political geography of home interpretable through four spatial paradoxes: a normative paradox of home being a good and bad place to die, a territorial <b>paradox</b> of <b>control</b> itself changing the home, a constitutive paradox between heart and welfare politics, and a relational paradox between autonomy and dependency. The implications for political and health geography, as well as political theory and hospice work itself are discussed as a consequence of recognizing these spatial paradoxes. ...|$|R

By employing a relational view of inter-organizational competitive advantage, the paper addresses the concept of quality management in strategic alliances and networks. We argue that institutional/network relationships influence the practice of quality within a network. In that regard, firms that have adopted quality management practices are more effective in managing and coordinating their interactions with other firms in the network, which results in their enhanced learning capability within the alliance. The proposed framework recognizes the role of trust and cooperative learning as critical factors that affect the success of strategic alliances. It {{has been argued that}} firms within an alliance need to achieve the <b>paradox</b> of <b>control</b> and learning. We examine the role of trust as a control mechanism in strategic alliances and address the importance of cooperative learning within alliances.

The feature that distinguishes the autopilot requirements of a UAV (Figs. 1, 7, 8) from the flight systems of conventional manned aircraft is the <b>paradox</b> of <b>controlling</b> a high bandwidth dynamical system using sensors that are in harmony with the low cost low weight objectives that UAV designs are often expected to achieve. The principal function of the autopilot is flight stability, which establishes the UAV as a stable airborne platform that can operate at a precisely defined height.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIt {{has been}} shown that abrupt re-exposure of ischemic {{myocardium}} to oxygen can lead to increased peroxidative damage to myocytes (oxygen <b>paradox).</b> <b>Controlled</b> cardiac reoxygenation, as an adjunct to substrate-enhanced cardioplegia, {{has been shown}} to improve myocardial function and limit reperfusion injury when utilizing standardized hyperoxic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The objective of our study was to evaluate the effect of controlled reoxygenation on myocardial function following global ischemia employing normoxic CPB. Study designNineteen female swine (30 – 40 kg) were placed on vented, normoxic CPB. They were subjected to 45 – 50 min of unprotected global ischemia (aortic cross clamping) followed by 30 min of controlled cardiac reperfusion utilizing substrate-enhanced cardioplegia. Group 1 maintained normoxic pO 2 (O 2 tension of 90 – 110 mmHg). In Group 2, reoxygenation was titrated gradually and increased from venous to arterial levels (O 2 tensions from 40 to 110 mmHg over 15 min). We measured coronary sinus blood samples for CK, CK-MB, nitric oxide, and conjugated dienes at baseline, 5 min into the cardioplegic resuscitation, 5 min after the cross clamp removal, and just prior to the termination of the study. Hearts were pathologically studied and scored for evidence of tissue peroxidation. ResultsAlthough not significantly different, Group 1 (normoxic reperfusion) animals were more likely to wean from CPB (p= 0. 141) and had a higher mean arterial pressure (p= 0. 556). In Group 1, conjugated dienes were significantly higher 5 min into the resuscitative protocol (p= 0. 018) and at the termination of bypass (p= 0. 035). Five of six animals in Group 1 eventually attained normal sinus rhythm as opposed to three out of 13 in Group 2 (p= 0. 041). There {{was no significant difference in}} histology scoring between the two groups for tissue peroxidation. ConclusionThis study of controlled cardiac reoxygenation in a lethal ischemic swine model failed to demonstrate that the use of controlled reoxygenation on the myocardial function following global ischemia was better with maintained normoxic pO 2 (with O 2 tensions of 90 – 110 mmHg) than when reoxygenation was titrated gradually and increased from venous to arterial levels (O 2 tensions from 40 to 110 mmHg over 15 min) ...|$|R

40|$|Theorists of {{learning}} organisations argue that learning {{calls for the}} emancipation of workers. Yet many critical analyses of contemporary control systems argue that this freedom implies a deeper slavery. This paper seeks to resolve this paradox through a theoretical analysis {{of the effects of}} control systems on workers. We argue that in its standard formulation, the <b>paradox</b> of <b>control</b> implies an inadequate conception of the nature of workers in contemporary organisations. Workers are perceived as passive, malleable, individuals. But as Gilles Deleuze claims, creative labourers in the controlled environments of the present day are not only (or even primarily) individuals - they are dividuals, that is, bearers of cognitive states and affective traits that are shared in common with others. As dividuals, workers participate in insurgent "becomings", collectively constituting modes of "minor" biopolitics that break with norms established by "major" regimes of biopolitical control. In our view, it is not the creative individual, but the generative dynamic between major and minor biopolitics that drives organisational learning as a complex bio-technological event...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the story}} [...] "Pamiętnik z okresu dojrzewania" [...] the author above all engages in <b>paradoxes</b> which <b>control</b> the {{entrance}} of the individual into the social world and also the repressed passions which rule human behaviour. In Ferdydurke (his first novel, published in autumn 1937, with a cover dated 1938) he discusses form as a universal category which was understood in philosophical, sociological, and aesthetic senses. Furthermore, this form is a means of enslavement of the individual by other people and society as a whole. Famous phrases of Gombrowicz are found in the novel and became common usage in Polish, for instance words such as upupienie (imposing on the individual the role of somebody inferior and immature) and gęba (a personality or an authentic role imposed on somebody). Ferdydurke can be read as a satire on various Polish communities: progressive bourgeoisie, rustic, conservative. Therefore, the satire of Gombrowicz presents the human being either {{as a member of a}} society or an individual who struggles with himself and the world. Stage adaptations of Ferdydurke and other works of Gombrowicz were presented by many theatres, especially prior to 1986, before the first 9 volumes of his works were published.

40|$|This paper uses a new {{database}} to establish two findings covering the first globalization boom before World War I, the second since World War II, and the autarkic interlude in between. First, {{there is strong}} evidence supporting a Tariff-Growth Paradox: protection was associated with fast growth before World War II, while it was associated with slow growth thereafter. Second, there is strong evidence supporting regional asymmetry: while the tariff-growth association was powerful and positive in the Core and rich New World before World War II, it was typically weak and negative in the poor Periphery. The paper offers explanations for the <b>Paradox</b> by <b>controlling</b> for a changing world economic environment. It shows how the oft-quoted Sachs-Warner results for 1970 - 1989 are significantly revised when one controls for trading partners' growth, trading partners' tariffs and the effective distance between them over the longer half-century 1950 - 1997. Falling partners' tariffs {{was the most important}} force accounting for the switch in sign on the tariff-growth connection after 1950. An increase in own tariffs after 1950 hurt growth, but it would not have hurt growth in a world where partners' tariffs were much higher, trading partners' growth much slower, and the world less closely connected by transportation.

In cultural heritage and archaeology, standards are emerging as global infrastructure components.

This research investigates the theoretical and empirical relationships between strategy formation, management’s role and the {{business environment}} within different organisations and at different times. Sixteen cases, representing insights of the strategy formation process in a large high technology company, are presented based on action research conducted over a nineteen month period. A theoretical framework, named the Strategy Formation Matrix, is developed to investigate {{the relationship between the}} strategy formation type and the management role. The model is validated and researched theoretically against the strategy literature and empirically in a multiple case study with six diversified companies. The framework is later extended to incorporate the business environment and these relationships are investigated based on a sample of seventeen diversified companies, who represent different industrial sectors and vary in size from small to medium to large. This research has developed new frameworks and models to describe the relationships between the business environment, the strategy formation process, management’s role and the size of organisation. In addition, it adds to existing models and challenges existing theories that link increased turbulence with a more emergent strategy formation process and a static business environment with a more intended strategy formation process.

40|$|Effective {{measurement}} of information system (IS) success {{continues to be}} a top concern for both practitioners and researchers. Labeled the "productivity paradox", previous attempts to quantify the benefits of IS have often resulted in inconclusive or inconsistent results. The present study contributes to IS success research through the development and empirical testing of a process-oriented model of IS success. Using an operational perspective and combining primary and secondary measures, this study examines the influence of lower-level intangible IS and information technology (IT) benefits on higher-level financial measures. Additionally, we introduce IS plan quality as an antecedent to the model's input variables. Primary survey data from CIOs of primarily Fortune 2000 size firms are combined with secondary data, total operational cost, from Compustat to facilitate the examination of the IS benefits. This study also addresses shortcomings cited in other studies that might have contributed to the productivity <b>paradox</b> by including <b>control</b> variables in the model, defining a research perspective [...] the operational success perspective [...] and clearly articulating the level of analysis as the organizational level. The results supported a process-oriented view of the benefits from IS and showed how the effects of IS along a path can lead to better organizational performance, in this case, lower overall costs. These results are discussed and future research implications are presented.

40|$|Hyperoxia is {{a popular}} model of {{oxidative}} stress. However, hyperoxic gas mixtures are routinely used for chemical denervation of peripheral O 2 receptors in in vivo studies of respiratory control. The underlying assumption whenever using hyperoxia {{is that there are}} no direct effects of molecular O 2 and reactive O 2 species (ROS) on brain stem function. In addition, control superfusates used routinely for in vitro studies of neurons in brain slices are, in fact, hyperoxic. Again, the assumption is that there are no direct effects of O 2 and ROS on neuronal activity. Research contradicts this assumption by demonstrating that O 2 has central effects on the brain stem respiratory centers and several effects on neurons in respiratory control areas; these need to be considered whenever hyperoxia is used. This mini-review summarizes the long-recognized, but seldom acknowledged, <b>paradox</b> of respiratory <b>control</b> known as hyperoxic hyperventilation. Several proposed mechanisms are discussed, including the recent hypothesis that hyperoxic hyperventilation is initiated by increased production of ROS during hyperoxia, which directly stimulates central CO 2 chemoreceptors in the solitary complex. Hyperoxic hyperventilation may provide clues into the fundamental role of redox signaling and ROS in central control of breathing; moreover, oxidative stress {{may play a role in}} respiratory control dysfunction. The practical implications of brain stem O 2 and ROS sensitivity are also considered relative to the present uses of hyperoxia in respiratory control research in humans, animals, and brain stem tissues. Recommendations for future research are also proposed...|$|R
40|$|The korB gene {{of broad}} host-range plasmid RK 2 {{prevents}} host-cell lethality by kilB and negatively controls RK 2 replication. We precisely mapped {{the limits of}} korB to a region near korA, an autoregulated gene involved in control of several RK 2 genes. The following results show that korA and korB are cotranscribed from the korA promoter: Mutants deleted for the korA promoter fail to express korB, even with korA function supplied in trans; the korA promoter is nonessential to korB if a heterologous promoter is present; and RNA produced in vivo has both korA- and korB-specific sequences. Analysis of polypeptides synthesized from wild-type and mutant korB plasmids in maxicells revealed that korB encodes a 52 -kDa polypeptide, whose activity is extremely sensitive to changes in its carboxyl terminus but relatively unaffected by replacement of its amino terminus. The minimal korB-encoding region allowed us to identify two new regulatory functions, both of which duplicate previously known functions of korA. First, korB alone was found to control the kilB 1 component of kilB, thus resolving the <b>paradox</b> of korA-independent <b>control</b> of kilB. Second, analysis of polypeptides from the korA-korB region in the presence and absence of korB, and studies with the korA promoter fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase structural gene (cat) showed that korB, like korA, autoregulates expression of the korA-korB operon. We suggest that korA and korB gene products act as co-repressors in the control of certain RK 2 genes...|$|R
40|$|Regulators in Europe and {{elsewhere}} are paying great attention to identity, privacy {{and trust in}} online and converging environments. Appropriate regulation of identity in a ubiquitous information environment is seen {{as one of the}} major drivers of the future Internet economy. Regulation of personal identity data has come to the fore including mapping conducted on digital personhood by the OECD; work on human rights and profiling by the Council of Europe andmajor studies by the European Commission with regard to self-regulation in the privacy market, electronic identity technical interoperability and enhanced safety for young people. These domains overlap onto an increasingly complex model of regulation of individuals¿ identity management, online and offline. This chapter argues that policy makers struggle to deal with issues concerning electronic identity, due to the apparently irrational and unpredictable behaviour of users when engaging in online interactions involving identity management. Building on empirical survey evidence from four EU countries, we examine the first aspect in detail ¿ citizens¿ management of identity in a digital environment. We build on data from a large scale (n = 5, 265) online survey of attitudes to electronic identity among young Europeans (France, Germany, Spain, UK) conducted in August 2008. The survey asked questions about perceptions and acceptance of risks, general motivations, attitudes and behaviours concerning electronic identity. Four behavioural paradoxes are identified in the analysis: a privacy paradox (to date well known), but also a <b>control</b> <b>paradox,</b> a responsibility paradox and an awareness paradox. The chapter then examines the paradoxes in relation of three main policy dilemmas framing the debate on digital identity. The paper concludes by arguing for an expanded identity debate spanning policy circles and the engineering community. JRC. DDG. J. 4 -Information Societ...|$|R
