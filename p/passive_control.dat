40|$|THESIS 10185 Poor {{air quality}} is a {{universal}} problem in built-up environments and presents a continued threat {{to the health of}} urban populations. Vehicle emissions have been identified as the predominant source of urban air pollution. This research aims to investigate controls which engineer the natural air flow patterns in urban street canyons. The control of air pollutants between a vehicle source and human receptor is carried out through the introduction of <b>passive</b> <b>controls,</b> such as low boundary walls or parked cars, and reduces personal pollutant exposure by increasing dispersion at street level in an urban canyon. This thesis describes three investigations; two generic modelling studies and a real world case study, to determine the potential of these <b>passive</b> <b>controls</b> in urban street canyons. The computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software FLUENT was adopted to simulate these street canyons and evaluate the effects of <b>passive</b> <b>controls</b> on pollutant dispersion within an urban environment...|$|R

2500|$|Guard {{cells are}} {{specialized}} {{cells in the}} epidermis of leaves, stems and other organs {{that are used to}} control gas exchange. They are produced in pairs with a gap between them that forms a stomatal pore. The stomatal pores are largest when water is freely available and the guard cells turgid, and closed when water availability is critically low and the guard cells become flaccid. Photosynthesis depends on the diffusion of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air through the stomata into the mesophyll tissues. Oxygen (O2), produced as a byproduct of photosynthesis, exits the plant via the stomata. [...] When the stomata are open, water is lost by evaporation and must be replaced via the transpiration stream, with water taken up by the roots. Plants must balance the amount of CO2 absorbed from the air with the water loss through the stomatal pores, and this is achieved by both active and <b>passive</b> <b>control</b> of guard cell turgor and stomatal pore size.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the present work was to assess iontophoretic {{permeation}} of Lisinopril at different current densities and concentrations for development of patient-controlled active transdermal system. Methods: In vitro iontophoretic transdermal delivery of Lisinopril across the pigskin was investigated at three different drug concentrations and three different current densities (0. 25 - 0. 75 mA/cm 2) in the donor cell of the diffusion apparatus, using cathodal iontophoresis along with the <b>passive</b> <b>controls.</b> Results: For <b>passive</b> permeation, the steady state flux significantly increased with the increasing of donor drug concentration. At all concentration levels, iontophoresis considerably increased the permeation rate compared to <b>passive</b> <b>controls.</b> Iontophoretic transport of Lisinopril was to be found increase with current densities. Flux enhancement was highest at the lowest drug load and lowest at the highest drug load. Conclusion: The obtained results indicate that permeation rate of Lisinopril across the pigskin can be considerably enhanced, controlled or optimized by the use of Iontophoresis technique...|$|R

40|$|This {{communication}} explores magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) boundary-layer flow of Jeffrey nanofluid over a nonlinear stretching {{surface with}} active and <b>passive</b> <b>controls</b> of nanoparticles. A nonlinear stretching surface generates the flow. Effects of thermophoresis and Brownian diffusion are considered. Jeffrey fluid is electrically conducted subject to non-uniform magnetic field. Low magnetic Reynolds number and boundary-layer approximations {{have been considered}} in mathematical modelling. The phenomena of impulsing the particles away from the surface in combination with non-zero mass flux condition {{is known as the}} condition of zero mass flux. Convergent series solutions for the nonlinear governing system are established through optimal homotopy analysis method (OHAM). Graphs have been sketched in order to analyze that how the temperature and concentration distributions are affected by distinct physical flow parameters. Skin friction coefficient and local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are also computed and analyzed. Our findings show that the temperature and concentration distributions are increasing functions of Hartman number and thermophoresis parameter.

50|$|A magnetorheological damper is {{controlled}} by algorithms specifically designed for the purpose. There are plenty of alternatives, such as skyhook or groundhook algorithms. The idea of the algorithms is to control the yield point shear stress of the magnetorheological fluid with electric current. When the fluid is {{in the presence of}} an applied magnetic field, the suspended metal particles align according to the field lines. Viscosity of the fluid increases according to the intensity of the magnetic field. When this occurs at the right instant, the properties of the damper change helps in attenuating an undesired shock or vibration. The relative efficacy of magnetorheological dampers to active and <b>passive</b> <b>control</b> strategies is usually comparable.|$|E

50|$|There exist {{two main}} <b>passive</b> <b>control</b> types for satellites. The first one uses gravity gradient, and {{it leads to}} four stable states with the long axis (axis with {{smallest}} moment of inertia) pointing towards Earth. As this system has four stable states, if the satellite has a preferred orientation, e.g. a camera pointed at the planet, some way to flip the satellite and its tether end-for-end is needed. The other passive system orients the satellite along Earth's magnetic field thanks to a magnet. These purely passive attitude control systems have limited pointing accuracy, because the spacecraft will oscillate around energy minima. This drawback is overcome by adding damper, which can be hysteretic materials or a viscous damper. The viscous damper is a small can or tank of fluid mounted in the spacecraft, possibly with internal baffles to increase internal friction. Friction within the damper will gradually convert oscillation energy into heat dissipated within the viscous damper.|$|E
5000|$|After 2005, {{treatment}} goals shifted towards [...] "passive {{oak wilt}} control" [...] on properties less than 5 acres and, for large acreages, treating to natural barriers or edges, especially when managing northern pin oaks on entisol soils. <b>Passive</b> <b>control</b> means letting the disease burn {{out over a}} few years and allowing native species to take over. Treating to natural barriers means restoring to native forest or savanna species by harvesting out to where oak wilt can no longer expand via root grafts. All oaks of the species that is infected are logged out, whether they are infected or healthy. Passive oak wilt control on large acreages creates short and long term problems for oaks. White oak group trees are at risk for infection from nearby sporulating red oak group trees for the short term; re-developing monocultures of oaks that sustain oak wilt infections for 50-100 more years are long term risks. Treating to natural barriers/edges or cover type changes is by far the best method to use when controlling oak wilt on large acreages.|$|E
