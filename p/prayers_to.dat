5|$|During {{the filming}} of his directorial debut Vandemataram (1939) at Hampi, Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy visited the Virupaksha Temple to capture {{the beauty of the}} monuments, which {{reflected}} the taste and artistic outlook of Krishnadevaraya, king of the Vijayanagara Empire. At the heart of the temple, Narasimha Reddy felt that he was standing exactly at a place where Krishnadevaraya had once stood and offered <b>prayers</b> <b>to</b> the deity. From that moment, Reddy decided to make a film in which Krishnadevaraya would be the main character, and he began working on the script.|$|E

5|$|Kinberg's wife Alice was {{a strong}} feminist, and during the 1980s {{he and his wife}} {{supported}} a number of changes to the liturgy and ritual. These included allowing women to read from the Torah and lead the prayers, and changing <b>prayers</b> <b>to</b> be more gender inclusive - for example, using gender-neutral terms and pronouns for God, and adding references to the Biblical matriarchs in prayers like the Amidah, which traditionally only mentioned the Biblical patriarchs. While most congregation members approved of these changes, a minority resisted them.|$|E

5|$|At the Council of Hieria in 754, Constantine V had {{declared}} the adoration of icons to be a heresy, and had thereby elevated iconoclasm to official imperial policy. No persecution of iconophiles was launched at first, but iconophile resistance grew, until from 765 on, Constantine began persecuting iconophiles, and especially monks. The {{discovery of a}} wide-ranging iconophile plot against him involving {{some of the highest}} civil and military officials of the state in 766 provoked an extreme reaction. Patriarch Constantine II and other officials were deposed, jailed, publicly humiliated, and finally executed, replaced by new, uncompromisingly iconoclast officials. In addition, the veneration of sacred relics and <b>prayers</b> <b>to</b> the saints and the Virgin Mary were condemned.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, Gandhi pooled {{ideas with}} some Muslim leaders who sought {{religious}} harmony like him, and opposed the proposed partition of British India into India and Pakistan.

Gandhi accepted this and began having Muslim prayers read in Hindu temples to play his part, {{but was unable to}} get Hindu prayers read in mosques. The Hindu nationalist groups objected and began confronting Gandhi for this one-sided practice, by shouting and demonstrating inside the Hindu temples, {{in the last years of}} his life.|$|E

5|$|Many {{art objects}} were {{produced}} in Northern China {{during the time}} of the Northern Celestial Masters. These objects were closely modeled on Buddhist designs. The image of the god (usually Laozi), would be carved on the front side of a stone stele, with inscriptions on the back or side of the carving. The inscriptions were usually <b>prayers</b> <b>to</b> the dead, a wish for the happiness of family members or wishes for political peace. The iconography and contents of the inscriptions show that a close relationship between Daoism and Buddhism existed in the Northern Wei state. This relationship is especially evident in some four-sided stelae that had carvings of both Laozi on two sides and the Buddha on the other two.|$|E

The sorcerer, who is ordered by Goddess Pathala Bhairavi during his <b>prayers</b> <b>to</b> {{sacrifice}} an intelligent and brave young man before her to be granted a statuette which grants any wish, feels that Ramudu is suitable for the sacrifice. While taking a holy bath in the nearby pond, Ramudu kills a crocodile that immediately transforms into a woman after being killed. The woman informs Ramudu that he had freed her from a hermit's curse and also reveals the sorcerer's intentions. Just before the sacrifice, Ramudu sacrifices the sorcerer and wins the statuette, consequently amassing the wealth {{equal to that of}} the king. In return, the king lives up to his promise and accepts Indu's wishes to marry Ramudu.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona I {{planted a}} pair of royal fig trees {{at the far end}} of the Bevato {{compound}} and stood between them when addressing the public. These were later complemented by additional fig trees planted all around the courtyard by Ranavalona II and jacarandas planted by the French during the colonial period. The figs that shade the esplanade are believed to be imbued with hasina enhanced by the bones and skulls of sacrificed zebu and special marking stones that pilgrims from across Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion and Comoros have come to place around them. Pilgrims gather in this courtyard to celebrate the Fandroana ceremony, during which time the sovereign historically engaged in a ritual bath to wash away the sins of the nation and restore order and harmony to society. Today, pilgrims celebrate by offering sacrifices or <b>prayers</b> <b>to</b> honor, appease or commune with their ancestors.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} the chronicle's bias against the {{descendants}} of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson {{is one of the}} two miracle narratives preserved by this source. The story in question is about a miracle attributed to St Mary, which may have been incorporated into the chronicle in order to discredit the reign of Haraldr Guðrøðarson. Whatever the case, the story deals with an aged chieftain named Domnall, who is described as a close friend of Haraldr Óláfsson, and regarded by the latter as worthier than others. The chronicle relates how Domnall and his young son were forced to flee from Haraldr Guðrøðarson to the sanctuary of the Church of St Mary at Rushen. The latter, however, is stated to have tricked them into leaving the church-grounds, whereupon they were immediately seized. It was in this time of need, so the story says, that Domnall's <b>prayers</b> <b>to</b> St Mary were answered, and that it was through her divine intervention that he and his son escaped from their imprisonment. The chronicle states that Domnall himself recounted the story to the chronicle's compilers. The account itself seems to have been used as means to portray Haraldr Guðrøðarson as a distrustful oath-breaker, and thereby further discredit the line of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson; conversely, the connection between Haraldr Óláfsson and the divinely favoured Domnall may have been intended to imply legitimacy in regards to Óláfr's line. Although the identities of Domnall and his son are uncertain, there is reason to suspect that they are identical to Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the eponym of Clann Domhnaill, and his son, Aonghus Mór (died c. 1293).|$|E
5|$|The Greek akolouthia on Saint Jovan Vladimir, {{containing}} his hagiography, <b>prayers</b> <b>to</b> him, and hymns to be chanted {{in church}} services on his feast day, was printed in Venice in 1690. The book was reprinted with {{small changes in}} 1774 and 1858. It was written from oral traditions by the deputy of the Orthodox Archbishop of Ohrid, Cosmas, who resided at the Monastery of StJovan Vladimir, near Elbasan. Copies of the book were distributed to other Orthodox churches and individuals. The akolouthia was also published in 1741 in Moscopole, an Aromanian center in southeastern Albania, {{as part of a}} compilation dedicated to saints popular in that region. A shorter hagiography of the saint, based on his life contained in this akolouthia, was included in the Synaxarium composed by Nicodemus the Hagiorite, printed in Venice (1819) and Athens (1868). Cosmas's text was the basis for the Church Slavonic akolouthias on the saint, which appeared in Venice (1802) and Belgrade (1861). The latter was printed as part of the third edition of Srbljak, a compendium of akolouthias on Serb saints, published by the Serbian Orthodox Church. The saint's life in English, translated from Church Slavonic, appeared in the book Lives of the Serbian Saints, published in London in 1921 by the Anglican Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.|$|E
