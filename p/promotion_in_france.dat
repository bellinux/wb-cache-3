60|$|The {{laws against}} foreign {{education}} are clearly {{the very worst}} {{part of the old}} code. Besides your laity, you have the succession of about four thousand clergymen to provide for. These, having no lucrative objects in prospect, are taken very much out of the lower orders of the people. At home they have no means whatsoever provided for their attaining a clerical education, or indeed any education at all. When I was in Paris, about seven years ago, I looked at everything, and lived with every kind of people, as well as my time admitted. I saw there the Irish college of the Lombard, which seemed to me a very good place of education, under excellent orders and regulations, and under the government of a very prudent and learned man (the late Dr. Kelly). This college was possessed of an annual fixed revenue of more than a thousand pound a year, the greatest part of which had arisen from the legacies and benefactions of persons educated in that college, and who had obtained <b>promotions</b> <b>in</b> <b>France,</b> from the emolument of which promotions they made this grateful return.

40|$|For nonprice {{promotion}} to benefit producers, it must raise the farm price. This principle {{seems not to}} be widely appreciated. In particular, a formula commonly used to measure returns to export promotion does not reflect price enhancement and therefore is problematic. An additional problem is that marginal returns, the usual measure provided in the literature, are often confused with average returns. This article discusses these issues in some detail using as an example salmon <b>promotion</b> <b>in</b> <b>France</b> and Germany. Study results suggest that promotion elasticity-based measures of returns can be misleading, especially in instances where producers or consumers are sensitive to price.

40|$|Static {{decision}} {{rules are}} derived {{to indicate the}} optimal seasonal allocation of a fixed promotion budget when substitution effects are important and prices are determined under competitive conditions. Optimal allocation decisions are governed by price elasticities of supply and demand, advertising elasticities, and consumer expenditure shares, {{all of which can}} vary seasonally. Applying the rules to Norwegian salmon <b>promotion</b> <b>in</b> <b>France</b> for the period 1996 Â– 98, study results suggest that the actual quarterly allocation of 4, 52, 17, 27 was inefficient in that the optimal allocation of 23, 26, 20, 31 would have enhanced producer profits by 9. 8 million kroner, equal to 27 % of the total promotion outlay. Ignoring product substitution distorts the allocation rule, in that optimal expenditures in the second quarter are overstated by 36 %, with corresponding understatements in the remaining quarters. Overall, an even expenditure pattern is deemed more profitable than pulsing. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E
