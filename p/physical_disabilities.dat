40|$|Current {{estimates}} {{indicate that}} nearly 67 {{percent of all}} U. S. adults are overweight or obese. To assist public health efforts aimed at reducing obesity, this study examines the independent relationships between adult obesity and three primary indicators of SES (education, occupation, income). This study also investigates potential mediators {{in the relationship between}} SES and obesity, and whether the SES – obesity relationship varies by <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> status. Logistic regressions are employed; results indicate that contrary to those with a <b>physical</b> <b>disability,</b> education and income are each independently associated with overweight/obesity for those without a <b>physical</b> <b>disability,</b> while occupational prestige is not independently associated with overweight/obesity for those without a <b>physical</b> <b>disability.</b> Among those with a <b>physical</b> <b>disability,</b> the relationship between occupational prestige and overweight/obesity is partially explained by race-ethnicity and smoker status. Among those without a <b>physical</b> <b>disability,</b> results underscore the importance of education and income for overweight/obesity risk...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{health of}} the elderly will be an {{important}} issue defining the health status of a population. With the rise in aged population, there is a greater need to look into their <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> aspects, which is otherwise neglected. The rationale behind the study is to assess the <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> of the elderly living in rural area of Jhansi. The aims of the study were to study the prevalence of <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> among the elderly of rural area, and to find out the factors and association affecting the <b>physical</b> <b>disability.</b> Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out in a Baragaon block of rural area of Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, India, from July 2015 to October 2015. Multistage random sampling was performed. A total of 265 participants of age 60 years and above were selected. <b>Physical</b> <b>disability</b> was assessed using Barthel index. Appropriate data entry and statistical analysis were done in EpiInfo. Frequency tables were used to calculate the prevalence, and Chi-square test was used to find out the association. Results: The overall prevalence of <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> was 23. 4 %. 70 % belongs to the age group from 60 to 69 years. <b>Physical</b> <b>disability</b> was significantly higher among age group > 80 years. Similarly, women were more affected with <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> than men. Conclusions: High prevalence of <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> is the major area of concern.

5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object {{permanence}} has been how <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence.

Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} skeletal muscle cutpoints for identifying elevated <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> risk in older adults. Subjects included 4, 449 older (≥ 60 years) participants from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 1988 – 1994. <b>Physical</b> <b>disability</b> was assessed by questionnaire, and bioimpedance was used to estimate skeletal muscle, which was normalized for height. Receiver operating characteristics were used to develop the skeletal muscle cutpoints associated with a high likelihood of <b>physical</b> <b>disability.</b> Odds for <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> were compared in subjects whose measures fell above and below these cutpoints. Skeletal muscle cutpoints of 5. 76 – 6. 75 and ≤ 5. 75 kg/m 2 were selected to denote moderate and high <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> risk in women. The corresponding values in men were 8. 51 – 10. 75 and ≤ 8. 50 kg/m 2. Compared with women with low-risk skeletal muscle values, women with moderate- and high-risk skeletal muscle values had odds for <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> of 1. 41 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 97, 2. 04) and 3. 31 (95 % CI: 1. 91, 5. 73), respectively.

40|$|Background Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) -related {{symptoms and}} physical performance are relied upon to guide therapeutic management {{of patients with}} AF. We sought to understand whether AF predisposes to or {{is a result of}} <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> and poor subjective health in the community. Methods We studied relations between <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> (Rosow-Breslau Functional Health Scale), subjective health (self-report) and incident AF, and the converse, in the Framingham Heart Study. Results In 3, 609 participants (age 73 +/- 8 years, 59 % women), a subset of 861 participants (24 %) had prevalent <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> at baseline. During 5. 8 +/- 1. 8 years of follow-up, 555 participants (10 -year age-and sex-adjusted incidence rate 13 %) developed incident AF. Prevalent <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> was related to incident AF (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio 1. 25, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 1. 54, P =. 03). In 3, 525 participants, prevalent poor subjective health (n = 333) also was related to incident AF (n = 552, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio 1. 31, 95 % CI 1. 00 - 1. 70, P =. 048). Conversely, in 2, 080 participants (age 69 +/- 6 years, 55 % women), interim AF (n = 106) was associated with newly reported <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> (n = 573) at a follow-up examination (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio 1. 58, 95 % CI 1. 08 - 2. 31, P =. 01). In 1, 954 participants, interim AF (n = 96) likewise was related to newly reported poor subjective health (n = 224, multivariable-adjusted odds ratio 1. 83, 95 % CI 1. 10 - 3. 02, P =. 02). Conclusions <b>Physical</b> <b>disability</b> and poor subjective health were related to incident AF in a community-based cohort. Conversely, interim AF was related to newly reported <b>physical</b> <b>disability</b> and poor subjective health. Because AF guidelines incorporate symptoms, it is essential to clarify the temporality and mechanisms linking <b>physical</b> <b>disability,</b> subjective health, and AF. ...|$|R

5|$|For {{those who}} are single when injured or who become single, SCI causes {{difficulties}} and insecurities with respect to one's ability to meet new partners and start relationships. In some settings, beauty standards cause people to view disabled bodies as less attractive, limiting the options for sexual and romantic partners {{of people with disabilities}} like SCI. Furthermore, <b>physical</b> <b>disabilities</b> are stigmatized, causing people to avoid contact with disabled people, particularly those with highly visible conditions like SCI. The stigma may cause people with SCI to experience self-consciousness and embarrassment in public. They can increase their social success by using impression management techniques to change how they are perceived and create a more positive image of themselves in others' eyes. Physical limitations create difficulties; with lowered independence comes reduced social interaction and fewer opportunities to find partners. Difficulties with mobility and the lack of disabled accessibility of social spaces (e.g. lack of wheelchair ramps) create a further barrier to social activity and limit the ability to meet partners. Isolation and its associated risk of depression can be limited by participating in physical activities, social gatherings, clubs, and online chat and dating.|$|E
