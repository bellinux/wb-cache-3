40|$|A well-researched, {{carefully}} planned publicity {{program is the}} best way for horticultural organizations to inform the public of its services, attractions, and need for support. Publicity is part of the marketing function promotion. It may be defined as the first step in providing an institution's audiences with information about the institution and its activities, and convincing those audiences to act on the information. <b>Publicity</b> <b>costs</b> nothing to place, and has greater credibility than advertising because it is published by impartial sources, the media. However, the media give no guarantee that publicity will be published, nor does the publicist have control over what is published, as he would had he paid for space. Some not-for-profit horticultural organizations have been slow to effectively employ publicity. The representatives of the organizations may not know how to publicize their garden, arboretum or society. They may believe" that publicity is unnecessary, or an undesirable way of calling attention to the garden. Publicity does have a role in botanic gardens and arboretums, however. It is the means by which the public can be informed of aspects of a garden or services which are intangible: relaxation, beauty, education. Gardens are rich in opportunities for publicity as well: spectacular displays, seasonal changes, and educational programs. A survey of publicists from botanic gardens and arboretums in the United States and Canada revealed how often those institutions used publicity, what media were most often used, and who was responsible for publicity. In-depth interviews with thirteen museums, gardens and horticultural societies showed how publicity is currently being practiced, and what some of the characteristics of a successful publicity program are. The last section is a manual for the development of an effective publicity program. First, the staff position of publicist must be considered: what sort of position it should be, the publicist's qualifications and responsibilities. Support for the publicist from the board, management and staff is essential. The publicity program itself must be carefully researched, planned, and implemented. Organization {{and the use of the}} right publicity,tool in the most effective medium at the proper time is especially important. Guidelines for the preparation of the basic tools of publicity are given: news release, feature story, public service announcement, photographs and slides, basic brochure and special events. The value of good media relations is discussed, and recommendations for their establishment are made. Legal concerns for publicists are also covered. Cooperative ventures are valuable means for expanding publicity. The advantages of working with other organizations and the ways in which it may be done are described. An effective publicity program must be evaluated if it is to continue to be effective. Recommendations for ways to evaluate publicity and report the results are made...|$|E

40|$|Each year company crises {{such as that}} {{involving}} Shell's {{actions in}} Nigeria and Europe generate substantial negative <b>publicity,</b> <b>costing</b> {{millions of dollars in}} lost sales due to reduced consumer purchase intentions. The little research that exists on crises mainly employs attributional theory (AT) and shows that consumer anger is the immediate antecedent of negative purchase intentions. While AT recognises that an appraisal of personal relevance of the event to the consumer is a crucial determinant of anger intensity, this variable is not included in the AT model. One model that does apply both the construct of personal relevance and emotions to negative events is Weiss and Cropanzano's (1996) Affective Events Theory (AET). AET identifies personal relevance of goals as comprising event appraisal. We modify AET for the context of mishaps, arguing that the broader construct of involvement is more appropriate to apply to company crises. Involvement is proposed to determine the level of processing of the crisis event and company and media responses, as well as anger intensity. The model represents the first application of the concept of involvement to the study of company crises...|$|R

As Indonesia in 2007 was designing a new law that would pass the constitutional test and encourage private investors in electric power, it was not clear that officials had fully understood the lessons of the earlier disputes. The original problems lay less in the legal framework than in lack of information about deals elsewhere, in the personal interests of highly placed individuals, and in the institutional structure and procedures for negotiations. The resulting power purchase agreements produced high electricity prices, imbalanced allocation of risks and rewards, and unwillingness to use the most effective defences when disputes arose. Learning from the past should help officials avoid similar mistakes in the future. ...|$|R

40|$|Innovations are {{considered}} crucial in boosting {{the growth of}} regions. Similarly, tourism is an important regional development tool, especially in areas with no industrial potential. Research on tourism innovation has been scarce until very recent years and the local economic impacts of innovation in tourism studies remain unexplored. This study addresses the innovative ICT application, a mobile game, and its significance as a tourist attraction in Pielinen Museum in Lieksa, a peripheral town in Eastern Finland. Pielinen Museum has a substantial effect on Lieksa municipality economy and the average visitor expenditure is substantially higher than expected based on previous studies on other local attractions. We conclude, however, the game is not known {{by the general public}} to attract visitors. From the museum's point of view, the innovation will not have extensive influence as a standalone, one time effort. It needs better integration into the museum's general public image and continuous support and updating for both contents and technique.

40|$|Internet Archaeology (IA) is an {{electronic}} archaeological journal funded entirely, so far, by eLib, the Electronic Libraries project. The eLib project's aims are {{to investigate the}} use of electronic publishing in the Higher Education sector in the UK and to promote culture change to {{encourage the use of}} the new media. A fundamental part of this project is the evaluation of its effectiveness and each eLib project has an evaluation strategy built into it. The eLib programme has adopted a scatter-gun strategy and has supported projects with a variety of approaches. Given the speed of change in recent years, both cultural and technological, this is only sensible. The use of the World Wide Web is affected by the availability of content, <b>publicity,</b> the <b>cost</b> of access and the development of the infrastructure (in which I would include both the investment in the Internet and the development of the software and hardware required to access it). The boundaries of what is possible are moving all the time, and the constraints which determined {{the way in which the}} project set out, and which were described at the CAA 1996 conference in York, may not now present such problems. For details of these constraints see the text of the paper given at the CAA 1995 Conference in Leiden. We are particularly keen to know more about the way in which people will use the journal since we are now planning to publish papers which will not be ready for publication until 1999 or 2000. One hurdle that has to be jumped is that of funding. At present, access to the Internet is by and large free once you have selected an Internet Service Provider. If this remains the case, then there would be a strong incentive for people to publish in their own web space. If, on the other hand, the party ends and the true cost of the Internet is passed on to the end user, then IA will have to follow suit. Unless the journal actually fulfills a function, however, all talk of its future is irrelevant. This paper will look at the way in which the first issue of Internet Archaeology, published in September 1996, has been used in its first half-year of existence. ...|$|R
40|$|They are run hard {{economic}} times and rapid {{changes in the}} technological environment. We are currently experiencing an information revolution without realizing it and without knowing fully the technology that surrounds us, and neither do their really powerful. These new changes that are happening made ourselves constantly update knowledge related to new technologies. The needs of people are growing and depend on {{the age of the}} information internet browsing. Today, many people do daily activities in relation to this environment, and we have many services associated with computers and phones. One of the most important human needs that exist in the world is taking care of our planet. That’s the reason why is detected the need to drastically reduce paper consumption due to high global deforestation which is under way. Companies have realized that printing paper invoices not stop, contributes to deforestation, which is why, since different countries are treating this issue very closely and are forcing companies to make bigger efforts in this regard. Companies do not just get global benefits such as reducing paper; they are also reducing their costs to avoid the process entails getting bills for different customers, suppliers, employees, companies and public administration. Regarding the needs and trend of bills in recent years, was born the idea of a web platform administration called Facturoteca electronic invoices. This platform aims to make a link between individuals and companies and even among small businesses, SMEs and large companies. The problem that exists is that the bills are given to products or services purchased, so there is the need to receive, manage and pay these bills. Facturoteca it aims to be a company to centralize bills to facilitate all the tasks of storage, control, analysis and management of all types of bills. This tool would allow huge savings of time for people who contracted this service and at the same time, through various ancillary services, would help analyse what is paid and why is paid to keep all documentation in an orderly manner, to have access to this from different places, hear about deals and other consumption. Opt for the SME sector and individuals for the numerous advantages: the technology is affordable, the market is large and barriers to entry are low. This combination of elements makes the technology services sector very attractive to SMEs. This could be seen as a countermeasure, due to is so an attractive sector, the risk of new competitors is constantly widening. But to enter the sector is necessary to know the secrets that make it up: what is the need for customer service look like, how to use technology, how to solve the problems of information systems, etc. In this view the future company takes an edge over competitors in the future, as currently there is competition, but works with fully electronic invoices still only large enterprises, forgetting the individuals. It is based on the idea, the knowledge needed to start the technique, but not enough. Today, due to the increasing competitiveness and greater knowledge, and therefore, higher customer requirements, forcing companies to look for solutions unlikely increasingly attractive and of course the best price. One problem for all new business is where to look for and find the first customer. Therefore it is important to clearly define and structure a plan that will enable communication and advertising company unveiled the fastest way possible. The communication plan begins to transmit company values implied by the corporate image and finding the best way to advertise in the media available. The human potential makes birth and grow the company. These are the people that make possible the development of the activity, and choosing the right group to participate in the project can make the difference between success and failure. Finally, the above would be meaningless if it was not backed by a financial study that made possible the development of the professional activity. The first thing to consider is the legal form of the company and once chosen, you can already do a calculation of the initial investment required: formation expenses, initial <b>publicity,</b> <b>cost</b> of software, etc. Facturoteca is intended as a small business based on a web platform, which thanks to the ability of the promoter, planned human potential, communication and good economic forecasts, has emerged as a company intended to achieve success in their professional activity and have a steady growth...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} BA {{dissertation}} is {{to analyze}} the current advertising and sales Promotion situation in the company with regards to its significance, costs and time. The outcome of this dissertation is to identify which forms of advertising are the most appropriate, which forms influence the customer the most and consequent recommendations for their improvement or expansion of advertising methods and Sales Promotion within {{the budget of the}} company. The second aim was to design a system in the Sales Promotion sphere which would make it more stable. Sales Promotion enables us to keep current customers and attract new ones. Sales Promotion in the company was, up until now, happening on an individual basis and rather ad hoc, for that reason it was necessary to set rules that would improve customer communication. The key issue was to carry out an analysis of individual methods in advertising. It was necessary to identify those methods that are beneficial to our company, those that are badly thought out, those that are unnecessary and those that our company lacks. We concentrated on the overheads and the time consumed by advertising and also on the effects of advertising on our customers and our business partners. We also looked at current Sales Promotion situation. Together with the company management we tried to design a stable system in the Sales Promotion, one that is simple and beneficial for our firm and our customers alike. The Antoni company trades on the meat market where there is relatively strong competition. The Antoni firm ranks as a medium-sized firm in the market place, hence it is searching for new ways of keeping current customers and attracting new ones. The firm is endeavouring to expand its operation throughout the Czech Republic as it has, up until now, operated mostly in the south of Bohemia. In partnership with the company management we also eliminated TV and newspaper advertising as methods of <b>publicity.</b> The <b>cost</b> of these methods of advertising were financially burdening for our firm and weren´t as effective as the company had hoped.

40|$|Background: In {{view of the}} {{increasing}} availability of commercial internet-based Personal Genome Testing (PGT), this study aimed to explore the reasons why people would consider taking such a test and how they would use the genetic risk information provided. Methodology/Principal Findings: A self-completion questionnaire assessing public awareness and interest in PGT and motivational reasons for undergoing PGT was completed by 4, 050 unselected adult volunteers from the UK-based TwinsUK register, aged 17 to 91 (response rate 62 %). Only 13 % of respondents {{were aware of the}} existence of PGT. After reading a brief summary about PGT, one in twenty participants (5 %) were potentially interested at current prices (£ 250), however this proportion rose to half (50 %) if the test was free of charge. Nearly all respondents who were interested in free PGT reported they would take the test to encourage them to adopt a healthier lifestyle if found to be at high genetic risk of a disease (93 %). Around 4 in 5 respondents would have the test to convey genetic risk information to their children and a similar proportion felt that having a PGT would enable their doctor to monitor their health more closely. A TwinsUK research focus group also indicated that consumers would consult their GP to help interpret results of PGT. Conclusions/Significance: This hypothetical study suggests that increasing <b>publicity</b> and decreasing <b>costs</b> of PGT may lead to increased uptake, driven in part by the general public’s desire to monitor and improve their health.

40|$|Background: In the West, the {{effectiveness}} of smoking cessation programmes is well established. Smoking cessation programmes in the East are rare. We evaluated a pilot smoking cessation health centre (SCHC) of the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health (COSH). Methods: The clinic operated 3 days a week from 6 to 9 pm. Smokers were recruited mainly by low <b>cost</b> <b>publicity.</b> Trained counsellors provided individual counselling and a 1 week free supply of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). The programme was evaluated in terms of process, outcome and cost. Results: During August 2000 to January 2002, 2212 calls were received through the clinic hotline and 1203 smokers attended the clinic. Eight hundred and forty-one were successfully followed up at 12 months. Based on intention-to-treat analysis, the 7 day point prevalence quit rate at 12 months (not smoking any cigarette during the past 7 days at the 12 month follow-up) was 27 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval, CI 25 - 30 per cent). The average cost per quitter was US$ 339 (US$ 440 including NRT cost for a 1 week free supply). Other benefits included training of healthcare workers and medical students, organization of seminars, health talks and self-help groups, and promotion of research and training. Conclusions: This first evaluation of a clinic-based smoking cessation service in Asia showed that the service was acceptable to Chinese smokers.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{increasing}} availability of commercial internet-based Personal Genome Testing (PGT), this study aimed to explore the reasons why people would consider taking such a test and how they would use the genetic risk information provided. A self-completion questionnaire assessing public awareness and interest in PGT and motivational reasons for undergoing PGT was completed by 4, 050 unselected adult volunteers from the UK-based TwinsUK register, aged 17 to 91 (response rate 62 %). Only 13 % of respondents {{were aware of the}} existence of PGT. After reading a brief summary about PGT, one in twenty participants (5 %) were potentially interested at current prices (£ 250), however this proportion rose to half (50 %) if the test was free of charge. Nearly all respondents who were interested in free PGT reported they would take the test to encourage them to adopt a healthier lifestyle if found to be at high genetic risk of a disease (93 %). Around 4 in 5 respondents would have the test to convey genetic risk information to their children and a similar proportion felt that having a PGT would enable their doctor to monitor their health more closely. A TwinsUK research focus group also indicated that consumers would consult their GP to help interpret results of PGT. This hypothetical study suggests that increasing <b>publicity</b> and decreasing <b>costs</b> of PGT may lead to increased uptake, driven in part by the general public's desire to monitor and improve their health. Although the future extent of the clinical utility of PGT is currently unknown, it is crucial that consumers are well informed about the current limitations of PGT. Our results suggest that health professionals will inevitably be required to respond to individuals who have undergone PGT. This has implications for health service providers regarding both cost and time...|$|R
