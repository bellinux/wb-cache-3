25|$|Electronic {{ignition}} (EI) solves these problems. In {{the initial}} systems, points were still used but they handled only a low current {{which was used}} to control the high <b>primary</b> <b>current</b> through a solid state switching system. Soon, however, even these contact breaker points were replaced by an angular sensor of some kind - either optical, where a vaned rotor breaks a light beam, or more commonly using a Hall effect sensor, which responds to a rotating magnet mounted on the distributor shaft. The sensor output is shaped and processed by suitable circuitry, then used to trigger a switching device such as a thyristor, which switches a large current through the coil.|$|E
25|$|When {{the spark}} gap fires, the charged {{capacitor}} discharges into the primary winding, causing the primary circuit to oscillate. The oscillating <b>primary</b> <b>current</b> creates an oscillating magnetic field that couples to the secondary winding, transferring {{energy into the}} secondary side of the transformer and causing it to oscillate with the toroid capacitance to ground. Energy transfer occurs {{over a number of}} cycles, until most of the energy that was originally in the primary side is transferred to the secondary side. The greater the magnetic coupling between windings, the shorter the time required to complete the energy transfer. As energy builds within the oscillating secondary circuit, the amplitude of the toroid's RF voltage rapidly increases, and the air surrounding the toroid begins to undergo dielectric breakdown, forming a corona discharge.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{reported}} hazard of {{this practice}} is that arcs from the high voltage terminal often strike the primary winding of the coil. This momentarily creates a conductive path for the lethal 50/60Hz <b>primary</b> <b>current</b> from the supply transformer to reach the output terminal. [...] If a person {{is connected to the}} output terminal at the time, either by touching it or allowing arcs from the terminal to strike his body, then the high <b>primary</b> <b>current</b> could pass through the conductive ionized air path, through the person's body to ground, electrocuting him.|$|E

2500|$|The spark {{generation}} {{story is a}} little more complicated. The purpose of the ignition coil is to make a spark that jumps the spark plug's gap, which might be [...] (it also has to jump the rotor-to-distributor-post gap). At the moment the points open, there is a much smaller gap, say about , across the points. Something must be done to prevent the points from arcing as they separate; if the points arc, then they will drain the magnetic energy that was intended for the spark plug. The capacitor (condenser) performs that task. The capacitor temporarily keeps the <b>primary</b> <b>current</b> flowing so the voltage across the points is below the point's arcing voltage. There is a race: the voltage across the points is increasing as the <b>primary</b> <b>current</b> charges the capacitor, {{but at the same time}} the points' separation (and consequent arcing voltage) is increasing. Ultimately, the point separation will increase to something such as , the maximum separation of the points.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{transistor}} or {{vacuum tube}} Tesla coils {{do not use}} a primary spark gap. Instead, the transistor(s) or vacuum tube(s) provide the switching or amplifying function necessary to generate RF power for the primary circuit. Solid-state Tesla coils use the lowest primary operating voltage, typically between 155 and 800 volts, and drive the primary winding using either a single, half-bridge, or full-bridge arrangement of bipolar transistors, MOSFETs or IGBTs to switch the <b>primary</b> <b>current.</b> Vacuum tube coils typically operate with plate voltages between 1500 and 6000 volts, while most spark gap coils operate with primary voltages of 6,000 to 25,000 volts. The primary winding of a traditional transistor Tesla coil is wound around only the bottom portion of the secondary coil. This configuration illustrates operation of the secondary as a pumped resonator. The primary 'induces' alternating voltage into the bottom-most portion of the secondary, providing regular 'pushes' (similar to providing properly timed pushes to a playground swing). Additional energy is transferred from the primary to the secondary inductance and top-load capacitance during each [...] "push", and secondary output voltage builds (called 'ring-up'). An electronic feedback circuit is usually used to adaptively synchronize the primary oscillator to the growing resonance in the secondary, {{and this is the}} only tuning consideration beyond the initial choice of a reasonable top-load.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a computer-controlled current-comparator-based calibration system to determine the current ratio errors of high-voltage conventional and nonconventional current transformers (CTs) under actual operating conditions of high-voltage and distorted current waveforms up to 100 kV and 2000 A is described. The ratio errors of a CT {{are affected by the}} applied high voltage due to capacitive currents flowing in its winding. The errors are also affected by the phase angle of the <b>primary</b> <b>currents</b> with respect to the operating high voltage. Therefore, the new calibration system allows the phase angle of the test <b>primary</b> <b>currents</b> to be adjusted at power factors of zero lag through unity to zero lead. The uncertainty k = 2 of the new calibration system is estimated to be not more than 20 7 10 - 6 for both the in-phase and quadrature components of the measured ratio errors. 9 2006 IEEE.

50|$|The switch {{contacts}} {{are on a}} springy iron arm, which holds them closed. The arm is mounted near the iron core. When battery power is applied, the coil acts as an electromagnet; the magnetic field from the core pulls the springy iron arm, opening the {{switch contacts}}, interrupting the <b>primary</b> <b>current.</b> The magnetic field of the core is switched off, allowing the arm to spring back, closing the contacts again. Then the <b>primary</b> <b>current</b> is turned on again, and the magnetic field opens the contacts again. This cycle repeats many times per second, while power {{is applied to the}} coil. A similar mechanism is used in the electric bell.|$|E
50|$|The CT {{is based}} on the {{principle}} of a transformer and converts a high <b>primary</b> <b>current</b> into a smaller secondary current and is common among high AC current measurement system. As this device is a passive device, no extra driving circuitry is needed in its implementation. Another major advantage is that it can measure very high current while consuming little power. The disadvantage of the CT is that a very high <b>primary</b> <b>current</b> or a substantial DC component in the current can saturate the ferrite material used in the core ultimately corrupting the signal. Another problem is that once the core is magnetized, it will contain hysteresis and the accuracy will degrade unless it is demagnetized again.|$|E
