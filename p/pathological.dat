5|$|Dementia with Lewy bodies {{is another}} synucleinopathy {{and it has}} close <b>pathological</b> {{similarities}} with PD, especially with the subset of PD cases with dementia. The relationship between PD and DLB is complex and incompletely understood. They may represent parts of a continuum with variable distinguishing clinical and <b>pathological</b> features or they {{may prove to be}} separate diseases.|$|E
5|$|Deterioration stage – Various {{organs are}} damaged due to {{long-term}} drinking. Medical treatment in a rehabilitation center will be required; otherwise, the <b>pathological</b> changes will cause death.|$|E
5|$|A Megalosaurus rib {{figured in}} 1856 and 1884 by Sir Richard Owen has a <b>pathological</b> swollen spot {{near the base}} of its capitular process. The swollen spot {{appears to have been}} caused by a healed {{fracture}} and is located at the point where it would have articulated with its vertebra.|$|E
5|$|Fin whales {{suffer from}} a number of <b>pathological</b> conditions. The {{parasitic}} copepod Pennella balaenopterae—usually found on the flank of fin whales—burrows into their blubber to feed on their blood, while the pseudo-stalked barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis is generally found more often on the dorsal fin, pectoral fins, and flukes.|$|E
5|$|Hannah Beswick (1688– February 1758), of Birchin Bower, Hollinwood, Oldham, Lancashire, was {{a wealthy}} {{woman who had}} a <b>pathological</b> fear of {{premature}} burial. Following her death in 1758 her body was embalmed and kept above ground, to be periodically checked for signs of life.|$|E
5|$|Heart murmurs are {{abnormal}} heart sounds {{which can}} be either <b>pathological</b> or benign. One example of a murmur is Still's murmur, which presents a musical sound in children, has no symptoms and disappears in adolescence.|$|E
5|$|Impulse control {{disorders}} including <b>pathological</b> gambling, compulsive sexual behavior, binge eating, compulsive {{shopping and}} reckless generosity {{can be caused}} by medication, particularly orally active dopamine agonists. The dopamine dysregulation syndrome – with wanting of medication leading to overusage – is a rare complication of levodopa use (Giovannoni, et al. 2000).|$|E
5|$|Initially, it {{has been}} {{suspected}} that immunoglobulins in general and autoantibodies in particular do not enter the nucleus. Now there is a body of evidence that under <b>pathological</b> conditions (e.g. lupus erythematosus) IgG can enter the nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Keynes {{thought that}} the pursuit of money {{for its own sake}} was a <b>pathological</b> condition, and that the proper aim of work is to provide leisure. He wanted shorter working hours and longer {{holidays}} for all.|$|E
5|$|Many Macroolithus {{specimens}} in South China have {{double- or}} multiple-layering of cones {{on the inner}} surface of the eggshell, a <b>pathological</b> condition known as ovum in ovo. It is especially prevalent among eggs nearest to the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary, which represents {{the end of the}} Mesozoic Era. This pathology is correlated with a higher concentration of trace elements like Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, V, and Zn. Experiments on modern birds have demonstrated that exposure to high levels of these elements will cause them to be incorporated into the eggshell, but the precise mechanism behind the <b>pathological</b> multi-layering is unknown. These abnormalities presumably affected hatchability of the eggs and may {{have played a role in}} the extinction of the dinosaurs. However, the embryonic remains inside three multilayered Macroolithus-like eggs from Ganzhou appear unaffected.|$|E
5|$|Phimosis is the {{inability}} to retract the foreskin over the glans penis. At birth, the foreskin cannot be retracted due to adhesions between the foreskin and glans, and this is considered normal (physiological phimosis). Over time the foreskin naturally separates from the glans, {{and a majority of}} boys are able to retract the foreskin by age three. Less than one percent are still having problems at age 18. If {{the inability}} to do so becomes problematic (<b>pathological</b> phimosis) circumcision is a treatment option. This <b>pathological</b> phimosis may be due to scarring from the skin disease balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), repeated episodes of balanoposthitis or forced retraction of the foreskin. Steroid creams are also a reasonable option and may prevent the need for surgery including in those with mild BXO. The procedure may also be used to prevent the development of phimosis. Phimosis is also a complication that can result from circumcision.|$|E
5|$|The French {{neurologist}} Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) was {{the first}} person to recognize multiple sclerosis as a distinct disease in 1868. Summarizing previous reports and adding his own clinical and <b>pathological</b> observations, Charcot called the disease sclerose en plaques.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} ways in which {{epilepsy}} occurs. Examples of <b>pathological</b> physiology include: unusual excitatory connections within the neuronal network of the brain; abnormal neuron structure leading to altered current flow; decreased inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis; ineffective receptors for inhibitory neurotransmitters; insufficient breakdown of excitatory neurotransmitters leading to excess; immature synapse development; and impaired function of ionic channels.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} staging classifications used; one is {{determined}} by MRI diagnostic imaging while the other is determined arthroscopically. However, both stagings represent the <b>pathological</b> conditions associated with OCD's natural progression.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the change}} in {{designated}} values relative to the WHERE clause, from a logic perspective the law of excluded middle is a tautology for CHECK constraints, meaning CHECK (p OR NOT p) always succeeds. Furthermore, assuming Nulls are to be interpreted as existing but unknown values, some <b>pathological</b> CHECKs like the one above allow insertion of Nulls that could never be replaced by any non-null value.|$|E
5|$|Circumcision {{may be used}} {{to treat}} <b>pathological</b> phimosis, {{refractory}} balanoposthitis and chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The World Health Organization promotes circumcision to prevent female-to-male HIV transmission in countries with high rates of HIV. The International Antiviral Society-USA also suggests circumcision be discussed with MSM who engage in primarily insertive anal sex, especially in areas where HIV is common.|$|E

5|$|Systems {{also exist}} to {{classify}} TBI by its <b>pathological</b> features. Lesions can be extra-axial, (occurring within the skull but {{outside of the}} brain) or intra-axial (occurring within the brain tissue). Damage from TBI can be focal or diffuse, confined to specific areas or distributed in a more general manner, respectively. However, {{it is common for}} both types of injury to exist in a given case.|$|E

25|$|The {{inclusion}} of behavioral addictions like <b>pathological</b> gambling must change {{our way of}} understanding and dealing with addictions. <b>Pathological</b> (disordered) gambling has commonalities in clinical expression, etiology, comorbidity, physiology and treatment with substance use disorders (DSM-5). A challenge is to understand the development of compulsivity at a neurochemical level not only for drugs.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{referred}} itch: normal and acquired (<b>pathological).</b> Normal mitempfindung is usually detected in early childhood and persists for the majority, if not the rest, of the individual’s life.

25|$|Nystagmus–This term is used {{variously}} {{to describe}} both normal and <b>pathological</b> conditions {{related to the}} oculomotor system. In the current context, it is a <b>pathological</b> condition involving an uncontrolled oscillatory movement of the eyes during which the amplitude of oscillation is quite noticeable {{and the frequency of}} the oscillation tends to be quite low.|$|E
25|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Ceratosaurus nasicornis, USMN 4735 {{was found with}} its left metatarsals II to IV fused together. Whether or not this fusion was <b>pathological</b> or natural to the species became controversial when Baur in 1890 speculated that the fusion {{was the result of}} a healed fracture. An analysis by Tanke and Rothschild suggests that the fusion was indeed <b>pathological.</b>|$|E
25|$|Specific {{types of}} neural {{oscillations}} may also appear in <b>pathological</b> situations, such as Parkinson's disease or epilepsy. Interestingly, these <b>pathological</b> oscillations often consist of an aberrant {{version of a}} normal oscillation. For example, {{one of the best}} known types is the spike and wave oscillation, which is typical of generalized or absence epileptic seizures, and which resembles normal sleep spindle oscillations.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of <b>pathological</b> gambling, along with fluvoxamine, {{clomipramine}} has been shown effective in the treatment, with reducing the problems of <b>pathological</b> gambling in a subject by up to 90%. Whereas in trichotillomania, the use of clomipramine has again {{been found to be}} effective, fluoxetine has not produced consistent positive results. Fluoxetine, however, has produced positive results in the treatment of <b>pathological</b> skin picking disorder, although {{more research is needed to}} conclude this information. Fluoxetine has also been evaluated in treating IED and demonstrated significant improvement in reducing frequency and severity of impulsive aggression and irritability in a sample of 100 subjects who were randomized into a 14-week, double-blind study. Despite a large decrease in impulsive aggression behavior from baseline, only 44% of fluoxetine responders and 29% of all fluoxetine subjects were considered to be in full remission at the end of the study. Paroxetine has shown to be somewhat effective although the results are inconsistent. Another medication, escitalopram, has shown to improve the condition of the subjects of <b>pathological</b> gambling with anxiety symptoms. The results suggest that although SSRIs have shown positive results in the treatment of <b>pathological</b> gambling, inconsistent results with the use of SSRIs have been obtained which might suggest a neurological heterogeneity in the impulse-control disorder spectrum.|$|E
