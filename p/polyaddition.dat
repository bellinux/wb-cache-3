The increasingly long-chain polyurethanes displayed physical and thermal characteristics (including melting point, lamellar stacking periodicity, and solubility) typical of polyethylene despite the presence of hydrogen-bonding.

The syntheses of each are optimized to give high yields and pure products. Each coupling agent is thoroughly investigated concerning the orthogonal reactivity of its cycles. For the ethylene carbonate thiolactone coupling agent, a one-pot procedure is established where four different building blocks {{are incorporated into}} one molecule. Every intermediate in this reaction sequence is isolated and fully characterized. The bis(thiolactone) coupler is again investigated regarding its chemoselectivity towards amines at different temperatures. Then, the bis(thiolactone) is reacted as an AA-type monomer with diamines as BB-type comonomers in a step-growth polymerization. Using two comonomers in different ratios for the <b>polyaddition,</b> thermal properties of the resulting polymers are adjusted. The obtained polymers, which carry thiol groups in the side chain, are functionalized via a simple Michael addition to different substrates. The Michael addition with acrylate functional PEG building blocks gives access to water-soluble polymeric amphiphiles. Regarding the last coupling agent, the reactivity of the cycles is explored towards mono- and dialkylamines. In a one-pot procedure, a four component reaction is carried out using the coupler and three other building blocks. Upon amidation of the thiolactone at low temperatures, an epoxy thiol intermediate is prepared, which undergoes a base-catalyzed thiol-epoxy <b>polyaddition</b> in situ.
