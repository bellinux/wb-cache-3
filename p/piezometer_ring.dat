50|$|The {{simplest}} installations use single tappings upstream and downstream, but in {{some circumstances}} these may be unreliable; they might be blocked by solids or gas-bubbles, or the flow profile might be uneven so that the pressures at the tappings are higher or lower than the average in those planes. In these situations multiple tappings can be used, arranged circumferentially around the pipe and joined by a <b>piezometer</b> <b>ring,</b> or (in the case of corner taps) annular slots running completely round the internal circumference of the orifice carrier.|$|E

Despite this, errors in permeability {{measurements are}} often ignored, and can be very large particularly in disturbance-sensitive gley soils. This work compares the uncertainties associated with six field methods of permeametry applied to a gleyed soil in upland Britain. Slug tests, constant-head borehole permeametry, and falling-head borehole permeametry were undertaken on established <b>piezometers.</b> Additionally, <b>ring</b> permeametry and two types of trench tests were evaluated. Method-related uncertainty due to proximity of impeding layers of high sorptivity soils produces under- and over-estimates of permeability {{by a factor of}} up to 0 √ê 2 and 5, respectively. This uncertainty band is smaller than the observed effects of anisotropy and temporal variability. Had smearing and soil-ring leakage errors not been minimized, the methodological uncertainties would have been so large that they would have distorted the true spatial field of permeability and its estimated impact on the balance of vertical and lateral flow.
