The third generation (2006-2013) featured an engine capacity enlarged to 680 cc and was renamed the NT700V Deauville. Honda marketed the third generation in the US for model years 2010-2013, simply as the NT700V.|$|E
50|$|A simple wooden base adds {{an element}} of {{protection}} to the model because the model itself {{does not need to}} be handled, it can be moved by handling the base. Bases may also hold a plate with some information about the model, such as its title or designation, or some historical background. This kind of bases typically consist of a frame of wood or other material. Finishes on bases range from <b>painted</b> <b>plastic</b> to stained wood to simple landscaping. The disadvantage is that the base adds expense and time to the project.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to attaching a lure to the fishing line, an oval {{piece of metal}} or plastic (often hammered or curved for reflective purposes) called a dodger or flasher {{is often used to}} attract fish from greater distances.

5000|$|When {{combining}} sensors, however, even a quite {{coarse sensor}} of one type {{can cause a}} huge increase {{in the value of}} another, more fine-grained sensor. For example, a highly precise visible-light camera can create an accurate representation of a tree and its foliage. A coarse spectral analyzer in the visible light spectrum, however, can reveal that the green leaves are <b>painted</b> <b>plastic,</b> and the [...] "tree" [...] is camouflaging something else. Once the fact of camouflage is determined, a next step might be to use imaging radar or some other sensing system that will not be confused by the paint.|$|E

Around this time, [...] "The Radiant Baby" [...] became his symbol. His bold lines, vivid colors, and active figures carry strong messages {{of life and}} unity. He participated in the Times Square Exhibition and drew animals and human faces for the first time. That same year, he photocopied and pasted provocative collages made from cut-up and recombined New York Post headlines around the city. In 1981, he sketched his first chalk drawings on black paper and <b>painted</b> <b>plastic,</b> metal, and found objects.|$|E
50|$|Shown in 1982, the Lamborghini Marco Polo or ItalDesign Marco Polo was a styling {{exercise}} by Ital Design. Not {{a running}} prototype, this Giugiaro design {{was only a}} <b>painted</b> <b>plastic</b> model for aerodynamic research. The Lamborghini badge on {{the nose of the}} car was not to imply any design program undertaken with the factory but was a compliment paid by Giugiaro to the famous manufacturer that became noteworthy for pushing the limits of automotive design. Although Lamborghini has a more exciting image to its products, Giugiaro decided to give this study a less aggressive line, preferring instead to focus on aerodynamic efficiency in order to provide a quieter passenger compartment and higher speed while maintaining fuel consumption.|$|E

40|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons to <b>paint</b> <b>plastics.</b> Some are <b>painted</b> for appearance; others for {{functional}} purposes.

The molded surface of non-painted plastic usually doesn’t have this desired appearance. The paint covers molding and substrate imperfections. Also, decorative effects such as metallic finishes, textures and color match of differently processed parts can be achieved by painting.

50|$|The {{second type}} of Cy Girls figures {{is known as the}} Perfect Body Female. These dolls molds were not based on the ones {{produced}} by Takara Tomy and instead they were manufactured and produced independently by Blue Box Toys, featuring 26 points of articulation based on the basic design of the Ultimate Soldier. This double-jointed feature on the knees and elbows enables them to be posed in the lotus position and any other conceivable position the human body is capable of. There are two interchangeable busts of medium and large sizes with nipples molded on them (the large bust was discontinued and replaced with a much smaller one that was almost flat chested), pivoting ankles and interchangeable hands, designed to hold any weapons or accessory. The products are packaged in a transparent box with a silver <b>painted</b> <b>plastic</b> strip covering the extra bust and the doll is dressed in a grey work-out sports bra with matching shorts.|$|E

5000|$|Although the Mazda B-Series {{remained}} largely unchanged in appearance throughout its eight-year {{run in the}} North American markets, there were minor changes here and there. For instance, 1986 was the only year that the Mazda B-Series retained a small chrome/white [...] "MAZDA" [...] emblem on its grille; in 1987, it was changed to a larger <b>painted</b> <b>plastic</b> piece to match {{the colors of the}} grille itself, and this remained unchanged throughout the remainder of its run. The 1990 model year saw the first major refresh in the B-Series: the front bumper and grille, which had been painted a dark metallic gray with light silver headlight bezels from 1986-1989, were changed to black with light silver headlight bezels. 1990 also brought the upgrade of a new and more modern alloy style wheel for the upper trim levels. Perhaps the most noticeable difference throughout the years was the gradual disappearance of the SE-5's stripe graphics. In 1986, the kit (which only came in a grayscale color scheme) covered {{a large portion of the}} sides of the truck, with lower and upper portions of the body being taken into account. In 1987, the SE-5's stripe kit was reduced to a much more simple set of lines running along the lower portions of the body and coming upwards towards the taillights where they read [...] "SE-5". By 1989, the stripes had been reduced even more, with new gradient-style graphics starting from the doors and running towards the back.|$|E
