25|$|Workers of the {{tropical}} leafcutter ant bringing leaf fragments back to the nest {{are at risk of}} attack by parasitodic <b>phorid</b> <b>flies,</b> who often land on leaf fragments and then proceed to oviposit (egg-lay) into the ant's head. To help combat this, small workers (minims) in at least seven species of Atta hitchhike on the leaves, deterring parasitioid attack. Many possible additional functions of hitchhiking have been proposed, some pertinent to social immunity; evidence exists that the primary function of hitchhiking minims' is actually to inspect and clean the leaf fragments prior to their entry into the colony, removing microbial parasites and contaminants.|$|E
25|$|Protopolybia exigua is {{a species}} of vespid wasp found in South America and Southern Brazil. These neotropical wasps, of the tribe Epiponini, form large colonies with {{multiple}} queens per colony. P. exigua are small wasps that find nourishment from nectar and prey on arthropods. Their nests are disc-shaped and hang from the undersides of leaves and tree branches. This particular species of wasp {{can be hard to}} study because they frequently abandon their nests. P. exigua continuously seek refuge from phorid fly attacks and thus often flee infested nests to build new ones. The wasps’ most common predators are ants and the parasitoid <b>phorid</b> <b>flies</b> from the Phoridae family.|$|E
25|$|The first {{systematic}} {{study in}} forensic entomology {{was conducted in}} 1881 by Hermann Reinhard, a German medical doctor who played {{a vital role in}} the history of forensic entomology. He exhumed many bodies and demonstrated that the development of many different types of insect species could be tied to buried bodies. Reinhard conducted his first study in east Germany, and collected many <b>Phorid</b> <b>flies</b> from this initial study. He also concluded that the development of only some of the insects living with corpses underground were associated with them, since there were 15-year-old beetles who had little direct contact with them. Reinhard's works and studies were used extensively in further forensic entomology studies.|$|E

25|$|In Brazil, P. exigua nests {{can become}} infested by <b>phorid</b> <b>flies,</b> which cause colonies to flee and abandon their nests. Megaselia picta females emerge from P. exigua nests and proceed to {{lay their eggs}} outside, on the {{uppermost}} envelope. This outer part of the nest contains meconial wastes and is where larvae reach the basal parts of the cells. Once the eggs hatch, the emerging larvae crawl towards the wasp’s nest and scavenge for food. Megaselia picta larvae will eat wasp meconia, eggs, larvae, and pupae. Megaselia attack quickly, with erratic-jerking movements and systematic oviposition behavior. Their distinct motions enable them to fly proficiently and walk rapidly. Aerial raids further enhance {{the success of their}} attacks, thus making these parasites a serious enemy to P. exigua. Megaselia scalaris have also been observed to cause P. exigua to frequently decamp.|$|E
25|$|A large {{variety of}} {{pathogens}} and nematodes also infect red imported fire ants. Pathogens include Myrmecomyces annellisae, Mattesia spp., Steinernema spp., a mermithid nematode, Vairimorpha invictae, {{which can be}} transmitted via live larvae and pupae and dead adults and Tetradonema solenopsis, which can be fatal to {{a large portion of}} a colony. Individuals infected by Metarhizium anisopliae tend to perform trophallaxis more frequently and have an enhanced preference to quinine, an alkaloid substance. <b>Phorid</b> <b>flies</b> with Kneallhazia solenopsae can serve as vectors in transmitting the disease to the ants. Weakening the colony, infections from this disease are localised within the body fat, with spores only occurring in adult individuals. The mortality of an infected colony tends to be greater in contrast to those that are healthy. These ants are a host to Conidiobolus, Myrmicinosporidium durum, and Beauveria bassiana, each of which are parasitic fungi. Infected individuals have spores all over their bodies and appear darker than usual. The toxicity from antimicrobial property of volatiles produced by the ants can significantly reduce the germination rate of B. bassiana within the colony.|$|E
25|$|Ants are the {{greatest}} threat of predation for P. exigua. Many of the wasps’ traits, such as polygyny and protective nest structures, are suggested to be survival tactics against ant predation pressures. P. exigua are also observed to swarm and use scent-trail diversions as defense strategies. During Megaselia infestation, workers attempt to destroy all infested cells in order to terminate the parasitoids. However, wasps are often unable to eradicate the phorid pupae due to their strong attachment to the cell bottom. If the workers fail, then the wasps close the nest entrances and the colony flees to another location in the neighborhood {{to build a new}} nest. Once they have established a new nest, wasps will entirely close the old nest’s entrance, which prevents the encroaching parasitoid flies from coming inside. The wasps also fan their wings and use their mandibles to peck attack the <b>phorid</b> <b>flies.</b> Since P. exigua seem to be specialized against the common predation of ants, Megaselia easily defeat the wasps’ defense strategies and frequently invade the species nests.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, a {{parasitic}} fly (Apocephalus borealis) larva, {{known to}} prey on bumble bees and wasps, {{was found in}} a test tube containing a dead honey bee believed to have been affected by CCD, [...] possibly indicating the <b>phorid</b> <b>fly</b> may be one cause of CCD. The mature fly lays eggs in the bee's abdomen, which feed on the bee after hatching. Infected bees behave abnormally, foraging at night and gathering around lights like moths. Eventually the bee leaves the colony to die. The <b>phorid</b> <b>fly</b> larvae then emerge from the neck of the bee.|$|R

The <b>phorid</b> <b>fly</b> lays eggs on the bee's abdomen, which hatch and feed on the bee. Infected bees act oddly, foraging at night and gathering around lights like moths. Eventually, the bee leaves the colony to die. The <b>phorid</b> <b>fly</b> larvae then emerge from the neck of the bee.|$|R
50|$|Apodicrania termophila, {{a species}} of <b>phorid</b> <b>fly,</b> attacks certain South American fire ants, {{although}} it's ambiguous {{as to whether it}} attacks S. saevissima because part of its life is spent cared by the ants.|$|R
25|$|In {{comparison}} to other ant species like Anoplolepis gracilipes, which rapidly take over areas {{they have been}} contained in, red imported fire ants are fairly easy to control. The first proposals to controlling the ant occurred in 1957 when the United States Congress authorised an eradication program using federal and state funding. Research on the ant and its biology has been continuous after {{the establishment of an}} eradication program, and many chemicals were used to eliminate them. However, scientists discovered that these insecticides were killing native fauna, and the Environmental Protection Agency subsequently outlawed them. Some scientists even questioned whether the ants were pests or not. Today, {{it is unlikely that the}} red imported fire ant will be eradicated in areas such as the United States. Populations can be managed properly if an integrated approach is used. Some scientists have considered using the ants' natural enemies against it; this includes T. solenopsae and B. bassiana. <b>Phorid</b> <b>flies</b> have also been viewed as potential biological agents, as they can reduce foraging activity in red imported fire ants and affect population levels. However, they are unable to affect colony growth rate. In addition, parasitic ants, parasitic wasps, mites, other pathogens, nematodes, and fungi have been considered to be potential biological agents. Others suggest that populations can be maintained or reduced by manipulating several ecological factors.|$|E
25|$|Flies in {{the genus}} Pseudacteon (<b>phorid</b> <b>flies)</b> {{are known to}} be {{parasitic}} to ants. These flies are parasitoids of the red imported fire ant in its native range in South America, and can be attracted through the ants' venom alkaloids. One species, Pseudacteon obtusus, attacks the ant by landing on the posterioral portion of the head and laying an egg. The location of the egg makes it impossible for the ant to successfully remove it. The larvae migrate to the head, then develop by feeding on the hemolymph, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. After about two weeks, they cause the ant's head to fall off by releasing an enzyme that dissolves the membrane attaching the head to its body. The fly pupates in the detached head capsule, emerging two weeks later. P. tricuspis is another phorid fly that is a parasitoid to this species. Although parasitism pressures by these flies do not affect the ants' population density and activity, it has a small effect on a colony population. The strepsipteran insect Caenocholax fenyesi is known to infect male ants of this species and attack the eggs, and the mite Pyemotes tritici has been considered a potential biological agent against red imported fire ants, capable of parasitising every caste within the colony. Bacteria, such as Wolbachia, has been found in the red imported fire ant; three different variants of the bacteria are known to infect the red imported fire ant. However, its effect on the ant is unknown. Solenopsis daguerrei is a reproductive parasite to red imported fire ant colonies.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{only are}} tissues from maggots {{used to detect}} toxins, shed casings and insect feces have also been used to detect and {{identify}} toxins present in corpses upon death. [...] An instance of {{this finding was demonstrated}} by Edward McDonough, a medical examiner in Connecticut. [...] A mummified corpse of a middle-aged woman was found inside of her home. [...] Prescription medicine bottles were found with labels identifying the following drugs: ampicillin, Ceclor, doxycyline, erythromycin, Elavil, Lomotil, pentazocine, and Tylenol 3. [...] McDonough performed toxicological analyses on stomach contents and dried sections of brain and found lethal levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline. [...] Insect feces, shed pupal cases of Megaselia scalaris (Diptera: Phoridae), and shed larval skins of Dermestes maculates (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) were gathered from the corpse at the scene. [...] McDonough sent these to an FBI lab which broke down the complex structures of the samples using strong acids and bases and freed the toxins for analysis. [...] The cast pupal cases and larval skins were also found to contain amitriptyline and nortriptyline. [...] Larger concentrations were discovered in the pupal cases because <b>phorid</b> <b>flies</b> prefer to feed on softer tissues.
