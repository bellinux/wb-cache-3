40|$|Central and Eastern European (CEE) {{countries}} are currently facing strong imperatives to increase incoming academic staff mobility. In this article, {{we focus on}} barriers and facilitators of academic mobility. We provide examples of Lithuanian and Czech higher education systems {{that are based on}} literature reviews and statistics coupled with interviews, focus groups and survey data. Barriers inhibiting academic staff’s mobility in these {{countries are}} constituted by low salary levels, lack of transparency and openness in recruitment and promotion procedures, bureaucracy and language barriers. There is also strong dissatisfaction with the lack of institutional support in overcoming these barriers. Facilitators that aid staff mobility include increased programmes taught in English, the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> <b>courses,</b> transparency of job openings, favourable visa procedures, residence permits and accommodation conditions. European initiatives have aided to facilitate incoming mobility in CEE countries, including Erasmus+, Marie Curie actions and Euraxess...|$|E

The first part deals with basic facts about migration of foreigners to Germany with the respect of current events. It also addresses the topic of integration, where are mapped the general integration efforts from the government, organizations and volunteers. Then the thesis is focused on the issue of <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> <b>courses</b> and inclusive education for children of foreigners. These theoretical parts are complemented by real observations from the German environment. Final theoretical part is about multilingualism, with an emphasis on teaching the main language in the classes for foreigners, qualification and competence of teachers, principles and methods of teaching the second language which is relevant for these classes. The practical part creates the concept of teaching immigrant children by using theoretical information. It includes intercultural aspects and the most intensive way, how to transmit the information.

40|$|The {{teaching}} <b>of</b> some <b>languages</b> in Australia {{is under}} threat due substantially to small enrolments. There is considerable {{need to preserve}} Australia’s community <b>languages</b> as part <b>of</b> the country’s cultural and linguistic diversity. However, {{it can be difficult}} to generate sufficient numbers to sustain the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> a specific <b>language</b> <b>course</b> in any one location in Australia. Online technologies can provide a solution to this problem. According to the New Media Consortium Horizon Report: 2012 Higher Education Edition “education paradigms are shifting to include online learning, hybrid learning and collaborative models”. Models such as these present a possible solution to the problems associated with providing small enrolment language topics such as Modern Greek. The Logos Australian Centre for Hellenic Language and Culture was established at Flinders University in 2011. Promotion and preservation <b>of</b> Greek <b>language</b> and culture is the focus of the centre which is funded by the South Australian Government with support from the Greek Government. In 2012 the centre moved towards enhancing the delivery of Modern Greek by developing and delivering four language topics and two culture topics online. The delivery of these topics identified assessment as an area which needs further investigation. This paper describes the importance of an assessment strategy for foreign language (FL) learning which is based on the principles of authentic assessment and describes how synchronous technologies can support this strategy...|$|R

40|$|Aim The aim of {{this study}} was to explore bilingual nurses’ {{perspective}} about providing language concordant care to patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) and its impact on patients and nurses. Factors affecting the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> concordant care to patients LEP were also explored. Background With an increase in migration and mobility of people across the world, the likelihood <b>of</b> experiencing <b>language</b> barriers while providing and receiving care is high. Nurses are responsible for providing care to patients regardless of their culture, religion, ethnic background or language. Language barriers, however, are hurdles that hamper development of effective communication between nurses and patients. Eliminating language barriers is a crucial step in providing culturally competent and patient-centred care. Design Qualitative descriptive study. Methods During January-August 2015, 59 nurses, working in acute hospitals in the UK, participated in 26 individual in-depth interviews and three focus group discussions. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings Four themes: ‘when we speak the same language’; ‘when I speak my patient's language’; ‘what facilitates <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> concordant care’ and ‘what hinders the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> concordant care’ were identified. Factors affecting nurses’ ability to provide language concordant care included individual factors (confidence; years of experience as a nurse; years of experience in the work setting; and relationship with colleagues), patients’ expectation, attitudes of other patients, colleagues and nurse managers, organizational culture and organizational policies. Conclusion Bilingual nurses can play a very important role in the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> concordant for patients with LEP. Further research is needed to explore patient perspective...|$|R
