5|$|The {{detection}} of the Amalthea gossamer ring from the ground, in Galileo images and the direct dust measurements {{have allowed the}} determination of the particle size distribution, which appears to follow the same <b>power</b> <b>law</b> as the dust in the main ring with q=2 ± 0.5.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 1986U2R/ζ and λ rings, there are other extremely faint dust bands in the Uranian ring system. They are invisible during occultations because they have negligible optical depth, though they are bright in forward-scattered light. Voyager 2s images of forward-scattered light revealed the existence of bright dust bands between the λ and δ rings, between the η and β rings, and between the α ring and ring 4. Many of these bands were detected again in 2003–2004 by the Keck Telescope and during the 2007 ring-plane crossing event in backscattered light, but their precise locations and relative brightnesses were different from during the Voyager observations. The normal optical depth of the dust bands is about 10−5 or less. The dust particle size distribution is thought to obey a <b>power</b> <b>law</b> with the index p=2.5±0.5.|$|E
5|$|The halo ring appears {{brightest}} in forward-scattered light, {{in which}} it was extensively imaged by Galileo. While its surface brightness is much less than that of the main ring, its vertically (perpendicular to the ring plane) integrated photon flux is comparable due to its much larger thickness. Despite a claimed vertical extent of more than , the halo’s brightness is strongly concentrated towards the ring plane and follows a <b>power</b> <b>law</b> of the form z−0.6 to z−1.5, where z is altitude over the ring plane. The halo’s appearance in the back-scattered light, as observed by Keck and HST, is the same.

25|$|Much {{analysis}} of the experiment has dealt with how the fitness of the populations relative to their ancestral strain has changed. All populations showed a pattern of rapid increase in relative fitness during early generations, with this increase decelerating over time. By 20,000 generations the populations grew approximately 70% faster than the ancestral strain. This increase and deceleration in increase has continued in subsequent generations. A 2013 study by Wiser et al. reported ongoing improvement at 50,000 generations relative to samples isolated at 40,000 generations. They found that the fitness increase fit to a <b>power</b> <b>law</b> model {{much better than the}} hyperbolic models that had been used earlier. As a <b>power</b> <b>law</b> model describes an ever-slowing increase that has no upper limit, while a hyperbolic model implies a hard limit, the work suggested that the increase would continue without bound as progressively lower benefit mutations were fixed in the populations. Further work published in 2015 reported the results of over 1100 new fitness assays that examined fitness changes through 60,000 generations. The data once again fit the proposed <b>power</b> <b>law</b> model, and, indeed, fit within predictions of the model from earlier data. These results suggest that, contrary to previous thinking, adaptation and adaptive divergence can potentially increase indefinitely, even in a constant environment.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSeveral {{empirical}} {{studies have shown}} that the animal group size distribution of many species can be well fit by <b>power</b> <b>laws</b> with exponential truncation. A striking empirical result due to H-S Niwa is that the exponent in these <b>power</b> <b>laws</b> is one and the truncation is determined by the average group size experienced by an individual. This distribution is known as the logarithmic distribution. In this paper we provide first principles derivations of the logarithmic distribution and other truncated <b>power</b> <b>laws</b> using a site-based merge and split framework. In particular, we investigate two such models. Firstly, we look at a model in which groups merge whenever they meet but split with a constant probability per time step. This generates a distribution similar, but not identical to the logarithmic distribution. Secondly, we propose a model, based on preferential attachment, that produces the logarithmic distribution exactly. Our derivation helps explain why logarithmic distributions are so widely observed in nature. The derivation also allows us to link splitting and joining behavior to the exponent and truncation parameters in <b>power</b> <b>laws...</b>|$|R
