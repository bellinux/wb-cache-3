We examine <b>pricing</b> <b>behaviors</b> of exporting firms under four different cases of vertical structure; {{in the case of an}} independent local distributor and in the cases of local distributors vertically restricted in three forms. From our theoretical model we find that the form of vertical structure for exporting firms has a significant effects on exchange rate pass-through. Since the measure of pass-through has not been distinguished between wholesale price and consumer price in previous researches, we conclude that the reported values of pass-through from previous researches only capture the partial <b>pricing</b> <b>behavior</b> of traded goods. We suggest that further empirical investigation in pass-through associated with consumer price is necessary for complete understanding of the <b>pricing</b> <b>behavior</b> of traded goods. exchange rate pass-through; pricing-to-market; vertical integration...|$|R

Price leadership focuses on the largest U. S. beer producer Anheuser-Busch and its heavily marketed brand Budweiser whereas collusion focuses on the three largest brewers. Results indicate that Bertrand-Nash predicts the <b>pricing</b> <b>behavior</b> of …rms more closely than other models. Concerns about non-competitive pricing of the forms studied here should hence be low in this industry. Despite its closeness to the observed <b>pricing</b> <b>behavior,</b> Bertrand-Nash under-predicts <b>prices</b> of more price-elastic brands and over-predicts prices of less price-elastic brands...|$|R

On the supply side dominate few roasters. Market structure influences the market outcome and explains the processors' ability to exercise market power. This paper aims at studying the <b>pricing</b> <b>behavior</b> in the German market for roasted coffee. Respectively, it discusses the impact of three different explanations. First, market power {{may be due to}} low price elasticity related to a high level of consumption. Second, <b>pricing</b> <b>behavior</b> may be influenced by the industry concentration. And finally, <b>pricing</b> <b>behavior</b> may be change over time due to exogenous shocks. In particular, the degree of competition has changed as a consequences of a merger. Further, cyclical demand changes induce <b>pricing</b> <b>behavior.</b> Empirical results are derived using data on the aggregate market for roasted coffee in Germany during 1992 : 1 to 2000 : 12.

50|$|Without {{denying the}} {{applicability}} of the Austrian theory of value as subjective only, within certain contexts of <b>price</b> <b>behavior,</b> the Polish economist Oskar Lange felt it was necessary to attempt a serious integration of the insights of classical political economy with neo-classical economics. This would then result in a much more realistic theory of price and of real behavior in response to prices. Marginalist theory lacked anything like a theory of the social framework of real market functioning, and criticism sparked off by the capital controversy initiated by Piero Sraffa revealed that most of the foundational tenets of the marginalist theory of value either reduced to tautologies, or that the theory was true only if counter-factual conditions applied.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of stock and option prices around block trades in stocks. The results indicate that for both uptick and downtick block trades the stock prices adjust within a fifteen minute period after the block trade. Moreover, for uptick blocks {{there is no evidence}} of any stock price reaction before the block trade. However, the adjustment of stock price for downtick blocks begins about fifteen minutes before the block trade. They also find that option <b>price</b> <b>behavior</b> differs considerably from stock <b>price</b> <b>behavior.</b> Specifically, the authors' results suggest that options exhibit abnormal <b>price</b> <b>behavior</b> starting thirty minutes before the block and ending one hour after the block. The pattern is more pronounced for downtick blocks and for put options. The authors interpret this abnormal <b>price</b> <b>behavior</b> of options before the block trade as consistent with intermarket frontrunning. Copyright 1992 by American Finance Association. ...|$|E

In particular, a model with learning and forgetting can give rise to aggressive <b>pricing</b> <b>behavior,</b> varying degrees of long-run industry concentration ranging from moderate leadership to absolute dominance, and multiple equilibria.

40|$|IPO underpricing reached astronomical levels during 1999 and 2000. We {{show that}} the regime shift in initial returns and other {{elements}} of <b>pricing</b> <b>behavior</b> can be at least partially accounted for by marked changes in pre-IPO ownership structure and insider selling behavior over the period, which reduced key decision makers' incentives to control underpricing. After controlling for these changes, the difference in underpricing between 1999 and 2000 and the preceding three years is much reduced. Our results suggest that it was firm characteristics that were unique during the "dot-com bubble" and that <b>pricing</b> <b>behavior</b> followed from incentives created by these characteristics.

40|$|Almost all {{research}} on the movement of stock prices on ex-dividend days has found that prices decline by less than the dividend. Though {{this is consistent with}} tax effects, several papers have argued that this phenomenon could be caused by market microstructure effects. In this paper we make use of a natural experiment that provides support for the tax explanations of ex-dividend behavior. Some closed-end funds have taxable, and some have nontaxable, dividend distributions. Both types are subject to taxes on capital gains. The implication of this for ex-dividendday <b>price</b> <b>behavior</b> is very different between these two types of funds if taxes matter. This paper demonstrates that the direction of ex-dividendday <b>price</b> <b>behavior</b> is consistent with a tax explanation and that ex-dividend-day <b>price</b> <b>behavior</b> changes, as theory would suggest, with changes in the tax law. © 2005 President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|E
