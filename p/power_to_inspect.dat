Fudge is concerned that Dumbledore {{is a threat to}} his power and that he is planning to train the Hogwarts students to overthrow the Ministry. After Voldemort appears in the Ministry of Magic at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Fudge finally admits that Voldemort has returned, and is sacked in disgrace from his position of Minister for Magic after the wizarding community calls for his resignation and is replaced by Rufus Scrimgeour, though he stays on as an advisor in Half-Blood Prince. Before his resignation, he makes several attempts to have Dumbledore arrange a meeting between himself and Harry so that Harry can lie on Fudge's behalf and make it look as though the Ministry is winning the war, but Dumbledore refuses, knowing how ridiculous Harry would find the idea.

25|$|While the {{embankments}} {{prevented the}} tide entering the area, they also prevented the fresh {{water from the}} north from leaving it, and drainage channels were cut to channel it to sluices through the main flood banks. Some of the early channels were cut by the monks of Meaux Abbey, but their primary function was probably navigation rather than drainage, since they ran east-west rather than north-south. Land drainage in England became more organised after {{the passing of the}} Statute of Sewers in 1532. This established Commissioners of Sewers for the main marshland areas of the country, with <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> banks, <b>to</b> assign the work of maintenance, and to impose fines on those who did not comply. By the early seventeenth century, the salt marshes to the south were generally free from flooding, although in 1646 a severe storm resulted in a breach near Drypool, which resulted in Stoneferry being flooded for 26 weeks. The protection of the salt marshes had been achieved by erecting a large flood bank at Sutton, which prevented water from the carr lands to the north from entering the marshes, but as it then had nowhere to go, the carrs remained waterlogged. Various plans for a new outlet to the south were suggested from the 1660s, but were met with opposition. In 1675, a local landowner called Sir Joseph Ashe cut a drain from Wawne carrs to the Hull, using windmills to pump the water into the Hull, and others followed his example.|$|R

New media {{technologies}} and social networks builds networks of meanings {{among the different}} citizen groups of civil society in terms of civil society being organized and making their voices heard as something vitally important in democratization. As we witnessed in many life practices with digital communication technologies reigning over our lives, activism works started to use digital platforms, too. Online activism is defined as usage of internet communication technologies for various forms of activism (Sert, 2012 : 129). And digital activism according to Uçkan is a general name given to the internet usage of different activism forms (2012). With activism becoming digitalized, individuals thinking that they have performed their social responsibilities with one click are criticized by some. As a response to these criticisms, Change. org campaign expert Paktin argues that digital activism {{does not change the}} world with two clicks but it strengthens the idea that the world is changeable with each click (2013). In this study, Change. org, one of the most preferred digital activist platforms with 125 million users globally is analyzed. The analysis covers the first 30 projects in the list of successful projects announced between the dates of November 2 nd - December 2 nd 2015 on Change. org. The sample is limited to Change. org, that has the most widespread working area in a global level. The aforementioned 30 projects are evaluated under the titles of subject, success time, signature count, campaign initiator, campaign collocutor, whether the campaign was on traditional and social media, whether the campaign subject was discussed at the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The evaluation includes that whether there is a correlation between these sections or not and aims to form a success index. Change. org is examined deeply using the method of descriptive analysis and the numerical data received is tabulated using the content analyzing technique. The purpose of the study is {{to make it easier for}} us to understand the effects of digital communication technologies on forms of social organizing. The importance of the study is based on showing that digital communication technologies transform our lives and how alternative views which have a hard time to be voiced through traditional media can get organized thanks to these technologies, as well as examining the common traits or differences of the successful projects. The activist platform that is the subject of the study is being examined in context of studies of Harold Innis (2006), who voices that communication technology is a representative of political and economic process, that ‘information moguls’ determined by technology direct the split of political power between society’s groups (Irge, 2012 : 67) and that deprived groups in the society lead the technological advances to gain power. In order according to the number of projects, subject titles are as 6 about health, 5 about environment, 4 about animal rights, 4 about education, 3 about women’s rights, 2 about entertainment and 6 projects as others taking place under different subject titles. Throughout the tables, it is seen that the projects about health succeeded the most and the projects with a higher count of signatures have appeared in both traditional and social media as a news event. The projects with a higher signature count were subject to the discussions in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The reason of this can be thought as both the signature count being high and various ministries being chosen as addressee. Also, it is seen that the projects about health could collect many more signatures. On social activism sites such as Change. org, besides the signature count being important as an oppression element, the addressee of the project and the project being published in all media choices are also effective elements for success. All projects about environment appeared in both traditional and social media, and were started by individuals. None of the four projects about animal rights were discussed at the Assembly. Among the four projects about education, the project with the most signature count is addressed to YÖK, concerning a great number of students. It is seen that the succeeded campaigns about Women’s Rights and Human Rights did so in a very short time. It is remarkable that all three projects about women’s rights are about television programs, and were initiated by women. Especially the private firms produced a solution in a short time for the projects initiated on Change. org. In our times, it is impossible for companies that don’t heed the social media to succeed. Manufacturers and distributers of digital technologies that allow expansionist policies, form information moguls and make the countries that they sell these technologies to, dependent on them. Sovereign powers who control information moguls, also have the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>inspect,</b> and stop if necessary, the institutions that perform research and development besides themselves. Communication technologies may not be the only identifiers of social transforming as Innis has defended but it’s a fact that they have an important role in this transformation. Alternative opinions that could not make their voices heard via traditional media, can get together, form groups, organize quickly and take action thanks to interactive internet systems. Activities of organizations like Change. org must be evaluated in this context. Another advantage of the campaigns is to make important subjects that get overlooked or fall from our agendas because of the daily bombardment of information, stay in the agenda. Sites that activist actions are carried out on, are significant platforms in terms of helping people about the problems they have, giving them a chance to show their sensitivity about specific subjects, create alternative solutions, make their voices heard by the authorities and get the support of other people that think and feel just like themselves. In terms of catching the attention of politic authority that has the legislative power, about certain subjects, and conducing toward getting desirable results, sites as Change. org can be an important lobbying tool. It must be expected that we would face more of different formations in the future due to new media technologies that are still thought to be in the infancy period...|$|E

Physical characteristics checked optically using Single Electron Microscopy (SEM), low and high <b>power</b> microscopy <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> the dimensions {{and the absence of}} particles. Then, by dropping the DI water on the nanoelectrode, electrical characteristics are measured using Dielectric Analyzer and probe station to measure the capacitance of the transducer. From the experiment, this ultra-high sensitive device is able to measure the capacitance as low as 98 nF in a very low frequency. The effect on DI water is investigated and optimized for the application in DI water electrical measurement...|$|R

Although the ECT Act was in part intended to curb the spam emails, the effect of the Act is practically very little. The study also found that some of the information security laws are ambiguous, for example, the Patent Act. Some of the laws pertaining to information security are very old; they were in effect introduced before the Internet was used for commercial purposes. These include the Merchandise Marks Act of 1941 and Copyright Act of 1978. The findings of this study reflect that information security practitioners were not really familiar with the avalanche of information security related legislation. Be that as it may, the contents of the IT policies from some of the organisations that participated in this study contain the provisions of legislation were catered for in the policies. This should be attributed to the fact that although information security practitioners were not consciously trying to comply with legislation, they relied heavily on the international standards. Most of these standards are in line with the requirements of the South African information security related legislation. In other words, corporate information security policies are {{within the framework of the}} Constitution of the Republic and the applicable legislation by default. They are not consistent with constitutional and legislative provisions by conscious effort on the part of the information security practitioners. It is in this premise that this study contains a concept model for legal compliance for information security at the corporate environment. This model embodies the contribution of the study...|$|R

In 2006 the Fire Precautions Act was withdrawn and following subsequent changes to the Licensing Act, Fire Services no longer have a duty <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> clubs, although they retain a <b>power</b> <b>to</b> close premises if and when they are brought to their attention.|$|R
