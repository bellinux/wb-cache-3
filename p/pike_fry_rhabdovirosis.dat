40|$|Plaque {{neutralization}} assays {{were carried}} out using the rhabdoviruses of <b>pike</b> <b>fry</b> (2 isolates), spring viraemia of carp and grass carp. When rabbit anti-pike fry rhabdovirus era were used, no neutralizing activity was observed but plaque counts increased with heat-inactivated sera or sera that had been stored at- 2 o °C for prolonged periods. Antibody binding to the virus was demonstrated by gradient centrifugation experiments. The use of immune serum alone or in com-bination with anti-rabbit gamma globulin serum resulted in aggregation of radio-active virus. Aggregation was also observed when anti-rabbit gamma globulin serum was added under neutralization test conditions. Addition of non-inactivated guinea-pig serum to mixtures of <b>pike</b> <b>fry</b> rhabdovirus and rabbit antiserum to spring viraemia of carp virus resulted in strong neutralization, whereas this antiserum alone or {{in the presence of}} inactivated guinea-pig serum gave an increase in plaque numbers. The increase in plaque number and the complement-dependent neutralization phenomena were weak or absent in the homologous spring viraemia of carp virus system. Immunization of <b>pike</b> with <b>pike</b> <b>fry</b> rhabdovirus resulted in an increase in virus neutralizing activity which could be attributed to the macroglobulin fraction of the serum. After immunizations over a period of 6 months with virus antigens, no further increase in neutralizing activity was observed. Pike sera showed 50 % plaque reduction at concentrations between o'o 17 and 0 " 3 %.

The fry were infected using bath challenge at 12 and 22 °C. Significant mortalities were observed at 12 °C for EHNV, ESV, PPIV and NZeelV. Background mortality was too high in the experiments performed at 22 °C for any conclusions about viral pathogenicity at this temperature to be drawn. Viruses could be re-isolated from samples from all challenged groups, and their presence in infected tissue was demonstrated using immunohistochemistry. The findings suggest that <b>pike</b> <b>fry</b> are susceptible to EHNV, ESV, PPIV and NZeelV and can be a vector for ECV and FV 3.

40|$|Spring viremia of carp (SVC) is a {{contagious}} {{viral disease}} mainly seen in farmed carp and related species. Outbreaks can cause substantial economic losses. SVC {{can be highly}} fatal in young fish, with mortality rates up to 90 %. In Europe, where this disease has been endemic for at least fifty years, 10 - 15 % of one-year-old carp are lost to SVC each year. The causative virus can be spread by fomites and parasitic invertebrates, and is difficult to eradicate; once it is established in a pond, elimination of the virus may require the destruction of all aquatic life. Since 2002, several SVC outbreaks {{have been reported in}} U. S., with both cultivated and wild species affected.

40|$|Proteins {{from four}} fish rhabdoviruses {{have been studied}} by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The viruses were: trout viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS), {{infectious}} hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHN), spring viremia virus of carp (SVC), and the <b>pike</b> <b>fry</b> rhabdovirus (PFR). For the two salmonid viruses (VHS-IHN), gel electrophoresis indicated the proteins, with molecular weights estimated to be 190, 000, 80, 000, 38, 000, 25, 000, and 19, 000, respectively. The electrophoretic profile of the two other viruses (SVC-PFR) revealed four major proteins with molecular weights of 190, 000 80, 000 42, 000 and 21, 000, respectively. In this case a minor component with 50, 000 daltons was found. For each virus only one protein {{was found to be}} glycosylated, i. e., the one with a molecular weight of 80, 000.

40|$|In March 1984, a new {{rhabdovirus}} {{was isolated}} from moribund cultured hirame (Japanese flounder) Paralichthys olivaceus and from ayu Plecoglossus altivelis fry In Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. From February through May 1985, the virus was again isolated from hirame in seawater tanks in Hyogo and Kagawa Prefecture, and in Hokkaido, Japan. At temperatures between 5 and 20 ℃ the virus replicated and induced cytopathic effects (CPE), which progressed to eventual cytolysis, in susceptible cell lines, including FHM, EPC, BF- 2, RTG- 2, STE- 137, HF- 1, BB, YNK, CCO, and EK- 1. The CHSE- 214, KO- 6 and CHH- 1 cell lines were refractory. Maximum virus titers of about 10 ^ 9. 3 to 10 ^ 9. 8 TCID 50 ml^[- 1] were obtained in FHM or EPC cell lines, and virus replicated optimally at 15 to 20 ℃. Virus particles were bullet-shaped and measured 80 nm × 180 to 200 nm. The isolate was sensitive to pH 3, to diethyl ether, and to heat (50 ℃, 2 min). Virus did not hemagglutinate human O type erythrocytes. Viral replication was not inhibited by 10 ^[- 4] M 5 -iododeoxyuridine.

40|$|Structural {{proteins}} of hirame rhabdovirus (HRV) {{were analyzed}} by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, western blotting, 2 -dimensional gel electrophoresis, and Triton X- 100 treatment. Purified HRV virions were composed of: polymerase (L), glycoprotein (G), nucleoprotein (N), and 2 matrix proteins (M 1 and M 2). Based upon their relative mobilities, the estimated molecular weights of the proteins were: L, 156 KDa; G, 68 KDa; N, 46. 4 KDa; M 1, 26. 4 KDa; and M 2, 19. 9 KDa. The electrophoretic pattern formed by the structural proteins of HRV was clearly different from that formed by <b>pike</b> <b>fry</b> rhabdovirus, spring viremia of carp virus, eel virus of America, and eel virus European X which belong to the Vesiculovirus genus; however, it resembled the pattern formed by structural proteins of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) which {{are members of the}} Lyssavirus genus. Among HRV, IHNV, and VHSV, differences were observed in the relative mobilities of the G, N, M 1, and M 2 proteins. Western blot analysis revealed that the G, N, and M 2 proteins of HRV shared antigenic determinants with IHNV and VHSV, but not with any of the 4 fish vesiculoviruses tested. Cross-reactions between the M 1 proteins of HRV, IHNV, or VHSV were not detected in this assay. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to show that HRV differed from IHNV or VHSV in the isoelectric point (pI) of the M 1 and M 2 proteins. In this system, 2 forms of the M 1 protein of HRV and IHNV were observed. These subspecies of M 1 had the same relative mobility but different pI values.

40|$|The {{responses}} of acidic water and aluminium on the newly-hatched yolk-sac fry of an acid-tolerant species, pike, and acid-sensitive species, roach were compared using 1 – 10 -day exposures. Test solutions were made either in lake water (LW) with moderate ion content or in artificial water (AW) with low ion content ([Ca 2] 0. 12 and 0. 034 mmol l 1, respectively). Roach fry died at pH 5. 25 or below in the LW, being more sensitive in Al-containing water. There was {{a reduction in}} the exchangeable body Na concentration of roach concurrent with {{a reduction in the}} number of swimming fry in the Al concentration of 50 mg l 1 or higher at pHs 6. 7, 5. 75, and 5. 25 in a 1 -day test in the AW. Although pH down to 4. 0 and Al concentrations up to 600 mg l 1 caused only partial mortality in pike during a 10 -day exposure in LW, various sublethal effects augmented by Al were obvious. In addition to decreased swimming activity, the rates of ventilation, oxygen uptake, yolk absorption and growth as well as sodium influx (Jin Na) were reduced. The initial Jin Na in the control in roach was over three times higher than in pike. This difference may render roach more sensitive to low pH and Al. The Jin Na of roach was unable to recover from a 92 % inhibition at pH 5. 00 Al (200 mg l 1) in LW, whereas the Jin Na in pike recovered almost totally by day 9 at pH 4. 00 without Al, and considerably at pH 4. 75 Al (600 mg l 1) from 88 and 91 % reductions, which in terms of molar fluxes were actually a quarter of the inhibition in roach. Both pike at pH 4. 75 or 5. 00 and roach at pH 5. 75 in LW, if Al was not added, were able to increase the Jin Na and O 2 uptake above the control levels (probably to compensate for the increased Na efflux). Although the percentage inhibition of Jin Na in a 1 -day exposure to Al concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 mg l 1 at pH 5. 0 in AW was similar in both species, the molar reduction of Jin Na was over three times higher in roach than in pike. High tolerance of <b>pike</b> yolk-sac <b>fry</b> to acidic Al-containing water is concluded to be interrelated to a low ion exchange rate as compared to acid-sensitive roach. The reduction in metabolism in Al-containing water further reduces ion loss and might provide even longer survival of <b>pike</b> yolk-sac <b>fry...</b>|$|R

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this thesis was to determine selenium (Se) levels in the major compartments of aquatic ecosystems and correlate these data with potential Se effects on early life stages of two native fish species. This work was conducted at two uranium (U) mines located in northern Saskatchewan, Key Lake mine and McClean Lake mine. In addition, a site fidelity study was conducted at Key Lake mine to evaluate movement patterns of northern pike inhabiting lakes receiving effluent discharges. At Key Lake mine, Se was accumulated and biomagnified several orders of magnitude higher than its concentration in water (0. 7 - 2. 7 µg/L) in lakes receiving discharges, with Se in prey organisms reaching levels above the proposed 3 - 11 µg/g dry weight (DW) dietary toxicity threshold for fish. Increased concentrations of Se in aquatic biota led {{to an increase in}} the Se concentrations in eggs and tissues of northern pike that rely on these organisms as food sources. Furthermore, increases in the incidence of Se-induced deformities above 30 % were recorded in fry originating from adults exposed to high levels of dietary Se (> 3 µg/g, DW). The increased frequency of deformities found in northern <b>pike</b> <b>fry</b> was associated with {{a significant increase in the}} level of Se in northern pike eggs from exposure sites (31. 28 - 48. 23 µg/g DW) compared to reference (3. 19 ± 0. 29 µg/g DW). At McClean Lake mine, Se was accumulated and biomagnified through the aquatic food chain with concentrations in some biota groups (e. g., forage fish) exceeding the lower limit (> 3 µg/g DW) of the 3 - 11 µg/g (DW) threshold for dietary Se toxicity in fish. Although both northern pike and white sucker females collected from the exposure site showed greater levels of Se in egg and tissues compared to fish collected from a reference site (likely caused by exposure to elevated levels of Se in prey organisms), no increases in Se-induced deformities were found in the developing fish larvae. The lack of a toxic response in fish larvae is in agreement with Se thresholds for early life stage deformities, with egg Se concentrations in northern pike and white sucker collected at the exposure site below the proposed 10 µg/g (DW) threshold associated with the presence of developmental abnormalities. The applicability of the proposed 7. 91 µg/g (whole body, DW) Se toxicity threshold to cold water fish is controversial given that most of the research has focused on warm water fish. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct studies that allow us to better understand the environmental fate and effects of Se in north temperate (cold water) aquatic systems. The results of my research will contribute valuable information for the establishment of a realistic and environmentally relevant Se threshold for the protection of fish populations in Canadian waters. During the site fidelity study, fish locations were seasonally and daily recorded using a Lotek SRX_ 400 receiver with handheld Yagi antenna. The results suggest that tagged pike did not migrate out of the study area throughout the study period, with the mean distance traveled ranging from 50 to 400 m. Differences in movement (distance traveled) and home range were found between reference and exposure sites. Overall data suggest that radio-telemetry is a useful tool in environmental studies. This information on northern pike behavior will be valuable towards developing non-lethal sampling methods that could be applied for assessing the effects of industrial discharges in north temperate aquatic ecosystems...|$|R
