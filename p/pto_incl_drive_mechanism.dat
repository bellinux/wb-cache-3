There are 4 <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in each group. The <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are below the reactor, {{and raise the}} control rods out of the reactor to increase reactivity. [...] These banks of control rods are arranged in two rings. The inner ring contains four <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> the compensation/shutdown rods, with one control rod for each <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The outer ring has four control/shutdown <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and four transient rod <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The control/shutdown and transient rod <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have two control rods for each <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism.</b> All the control rods contain B4C poison sections. The compensation/shutdown and control/shutdown <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are mechanical lead screw driven, and have use pneumatic pressure to assist the scram function. The four transient rod drives are hydraulically actuated, and are controlled by the ARCS to control transients. These transient rods move up to 170 in/sec over a total travel of 40 inches (i.e. full 40 inch stroke in about 0.24 seconds).|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} {{stop control}} system and method are provided for a motor having a <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{in which the}} motor is coupled to a motor controller that controls the speed and position of the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> using a first signal indicative of a commanded position of the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism,</b> a second signal indicative of the actual speed of the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> and a third signal indicative of the actual position of the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The improved system/method uses a first circuit that receives {{the first and third}} signal and generates an error signal indicative of a difference therebetween. A second circuit receives the error signal and compares same with a threshold position error. The result of this comparison is used to selectively supply the second signal (i. e., speed) to the motor controller at least whenever the error signal is less than the threshold position error so that the motor controller can use the second signal in conjunction with the third signal to stop the motor...|$|R

It {{is difficult to}} obtain wide motion range of about ±[*] 90 ° for each joint by the link <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Also, link <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{need a lot of}} components and manufacturing accuracy of parts to reduce link backlash, and the cost increases.|$|R
40|$|Natural orifice translumenal {{endoscopic}} surgery (NOTES) {{has reduced the}} invasiveness of surgery by eliminating external incisions on the patient. With this type of procedure, recovery time is drastically shortened, cosmetics are improved, and infections and pain are greatly reduced. For NOTES procedures to be successfully performed, a flexible endoscope or similar instrument is important for passing orifice flexures. However, technological deficiencies like poor angulations of surgical instruments introduced through working channels in flexible endoscopes, the lack of scope fixation, and lack of scope stiffening are technological barriers which prevent NOTES from being widely accepted in human surgeries. A novel multifunctional robot with an articulated <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> for NOTES has been developed. The steerable articulating <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{is connected to the}} robotic end effector to guide the robot and navigate through a natural orifice. The design process for the articulating <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> and engineering analysis are discussed in this paper. Workspace of the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> with and without a translational insertion degree of freedom is presented in detail. The kinematics of the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is also discussed. Additionally, friction in the spherical joints of the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is explored to characterize its influence on the overall shape achieved by the articulation, including the effects of varying the total length in the steering mechanism. The surgeon control console for the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is briefly discussed as well. Bench-top testing results are presented as proof of feasibility of the design...|$|R

40|$|Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is {{a fairly}} recent {{surgical}} approach that {{eliminates the need for}} external incisions on the patient. NOTES takes the minimally invasive surgery paradigm a step further by using a natural orifice as the pathway to transport surgical tools to the surgical site and completely eliminating the need for even the smallest incision on the skin. Although the concept of NOTES has been in existence for the past decade, technological deficiencies prevent it from being widely accepted in human surgeries. A novel multifunctional robot for NOTES has been developed to overcome these limitations and make the approach a feasible one. The NOTES robot comprises a multifunctional robotic manipulator and a steerable and articulating <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The robotic manipulator carries three interchangeable surgical tool tips in a cartridge that enables tool changing without removing the robot from the patient. A stereovision camera is attached {{at the tip of the}} robotic manipulator to provide real-time video feedback to the surgeon. A steerable articulating <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is connected to the robotic manipulator to guide the robot and navigate through a natural orifice. Besides its guiding capabilities, the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is also shape-lockable which provides a stable platform for the robotic manipulator to perform surgeries. The design process and engineering analysis for the articulating <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> are discussed in detail in this thesis. The first-generation <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is designed and built as a proof of concept. Bench-top tests show that the design achieves the purpose of guiding and positioning the robotic manipulator. It is believed that the articulating <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> can provide freedom of movement to the robotic manipulator and help circumvent some of the difficulties faced by approaches such as typical minimally invasive surgery (MIS). The second generation of the articulating <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is presented next, whereby the overall size of the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is reduced significantly and the components in part of the drive transmission are also altered. Phantom Omni joysticks from SensAble Technologies are used as control consoles for the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The programming for the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> controls has been developed and is presented in this thesis. Although further improvements are necessary to the current iteration of the robot, bench-top testing results show promise of continued success for the multifunctional robot for NOTES.

40|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} principles to perform shedding motion which are; cam mechanism, dobby controlled mechanism and jacquard controlled mechanism. A dobby mechanism {{consists of three}} main parts; <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism,</b> selection mechanism and mechanism for transferring motion to the frames. Rotary dobby mechanisms are being used in shedding process of high-speed weaving machines. In this paper, design and synthesis of a novel <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> had been explained. The <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which is used in this research, is an eight component lever-gear mechanism. The most important innovation is in the motion transmission mechanism on the main shaft of rotational dobby. It is known that main shaft in rotary dobby has dwell period in only one direction. The novel <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is designed to make equally timed, double stand-by positioned oscilational motion. After designing of the rotary dobby, the mechanisms are produced and montaged. It was confirmed that dobby run well and durably with all mechanism and shedding process is precisely carried out. The experimental values of dwell angles at {{the right and left}} dead-center positions are similar to theoretical values. Experimental results show that; if the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> and dobby is generated with advanced technology, it is possible to use it in dobby industry...|$|R

The goal {{is to find out}} the relationship between the rhombic <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> parameters and the performance of a low-temperature differential Stirling engine. The results indicate that the offset distance from the gear center and gear radius of the rhombic <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> have to be maximized, in order to increase the indicated power, while other rhombic drive parameters should be reduced for the same reason. Another result is that for realizing the optimized phase angle for beta-type Stirling engines, one should act on working piston-related bars and rhombic drive gear radius.|$|R

40|$|Tests {{were carried}} out to analyse the affects speed {{variation}} has on irrigation efficiency in travelling irrigators. These trials required the data collection {{of a number of}} different parameters, these being longitudinal and lateral depth; applied velocity variation; water flow and pressure. From these results, distribution uniformity and velocity variations can be deduced. It was found that velocity variation reduced distribution uniformity, and the velocity variation characteristics are dependent on the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The auxiliary engine offered consistent average velocity with small oscillating velocity values, while the turbine's velocity tended to vary slightly more across the run. As well, oscillations were greater, while the piston <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> tended to change rapidly with no particular trend. It was decided this was due to a characteristic of the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> itself, as the test data offered no other reasons for the extreme variations. It was also concluded that the cable drum radius changes significantly across the run, causing variation in speed over the whole run as possibly causing oscillations throughout. It was concluded that irrigation efficiency is influenced by the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> in use, and improvements in the performance of these <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> could be achieved if the cable could be applied evenly onto the cable drum...|$|R

In order to meet higher demands on cost and accuracy, measuring machines can be constructed with weaker materials and increased mechanical flexibilities, and therefore {{there is a need to}} include the flexibilities in measuring machine models to obtain good performance. The core theme in this thesis is modeling and idenfication of the physical parameters of <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of a Brown&Sharpe Inc. Global A coordinate measuring machine. The approximation made is that the <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can be described by a mass connected by springs, dampers and gear changes.

The algorithms are based on prediction error methods. For the off-line identification the MATLAB System Identification Toolbox and the bond graph representation is used. The chosen model is then used for control. Traditional control and a Model-reference Adaptive System is derived and studied with the aim to increase the damping of CMM <b>drive</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> It is found that the adaptive system has very good disturbance rejection and can correct for drastic model errors.
