40|$|Abstract-In many undersea conditions, {{optical sensors}} and sonar {{can be used}} to {{discriminate}} against sea mines. However, there are many conditions where these sensors are insufficient. For example, when a mine is fully buried these sensors are of little help. Under these conditions, additional sensor technologies are required. Since it is not affected by the medium, a technology of choice is magnetics. In the late 1990 ’s a “T-shaped ” gradiometer with a 12 -inch baseline was developed. It became known as the RTG.
