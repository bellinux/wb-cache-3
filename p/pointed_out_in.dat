5|$|Claims of {{intermediate}} mass {{black holes}} {{have been met}} with some skepticism. The heaviest objects in globular clusters are expected to migrate to the cluster center due to mass segregation. As <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> two papers by Holger Baumgardt and collaborators, the mass-to-light ratio should rise sharply towards {{the center of the}} cluster, even without a black hole, in both M15 and Mayall II.|$|E

5|$|From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a {{great deal}} of his time and fortune on a series of {{projects}} trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He could see this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.|$|E
5|$|While {{proud to}} be the first French World Champion, Prost, annoyed that French journalists were proclaiming it as a win for France, <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> {{interviews}} that other than himself, nothing about the car (the MP4/2B) {{had anything to do with}} France. The team was British (having been founded by a New Zealander), the tyres were American Goodyears, the TAG-Porsche engine was German, the chassis itself was built by Hercules Aerospace in the USA, and was sponsored by an American tobacco company (Marlboro) and the Saudi Arabian owned company Techniques d'Avant Garde (TAG).|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} much {{speculation}} {{at the time}} in the Adelaide and Melbourne press on why the lifeboats had not been launched earlier. Survivor James Fitzgerald <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> his recollection that, had the lifeboats been filled to capacity, no one would have survived the severe weather conditions experienced. He also commented that passenger vessels were not required to carry enough lifeboats, concluding that there were insufficient places for all Gothenburgs passengers and crew. It was not until RMS Titanic sank some 37 years later in 1912, that it was made compulsory for all British registered ships to carry sufficient lifeboats for everyone on board.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, the palaeontologists Spencer G. Lucas and Jay C. Sobus {{published}} {{a revision of}} indricothere taxa, which is followed by most western scientists today. They concluded that Paraceratherium, as the oldest name, was the only valid indricothere genus from the Oligocene, and contained four valid species, P. bugtiense, P. transouralicum, P. prohorovi, and P. orgosensis. They considered most other names to be junior synonyms of those taxa, or as dubious names, based on remains too fragmentary to identify properly. By analysing alleged differences between named genera and species, Lucas and Sobus found that these most likely represented variation within populations, and that most features were indistinguishable between specimens, as had been <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the 1930s. The fact that the single skull assigned to P. transouralicum or Indricotherium was domed, while others were flat at the top was attributed to sexual dimorphism. Therefore, {{it is possible that}} P. bugtiense fossils represent the female, while P. transouralicum represents the male of the same species.|$|E
5|$|Fender's form {{dipped in}} 1924 {{after a good}} start with bat and ball; thereafter, despite {{occasional}} successes, he lacked consistency. Surrey {{finished third in the}} Championship, and Fender contributed 1,004 runs and 84 wickets in all first-class matches. Once again, Fender was a candidate for the England captaincy—South Africa played a Test series that season, and the MCC were to tour Australia in 1924–25. The eventual appointment of Arthur Gilligan was criticised in the press, which again speculated why Fender was not chosen. Fender's prospects of leading England receded further when he clashed once more with Lord Harris. The MCC had rebuked two county committees for covering their pitches prior to matches against the South Africans during a spell of wet weather. Fender <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a letter published by the press that Lord Harris and the MCC were aware that this was common practice at the Scarborough Festival, despite their claims to the contrary. When Fender next played at Lord's, the furious Lord Harris summoned Fender to admonish him. Fender always regretted his indiscretion and believed it finished any chance he had of the England captaincy. Fender played in the first two Tests, without much success, and was dropped; he played only one more Test in his career. Gilligan was injured during the series, but the selectors recalled Douglas as captain rather than select Fender. When the team to tour Australia that winter was chosen, Fender was not selected, a decision which upset him deeply. Fender was married {{at the end of the}} 1924 cricket season, and in the off-season wrote about the MCC tour of Australia for the Daily Express.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of whether people from different cultures vary in locus of control has long been of interest to social psychologists. Japanese {{people tend to be}} more external in locus-of-control orientation than people in the U.S.; however, differences in locus of control between different countries within Europe (and between the U.S. and Europe) tend to be small. As Berry et al. <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> 1992, ethnic groups within the United States have been compared on locus of control; African Americans in the U.S. are more external than whites when socioeconomic status is controlled. Berry et al. also <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> 1992 how research on other ethnic minorities in the U.S. (such as Hispanics) has been ambiguous. More on cross-cultural variations in locus of control can be found in Shiraev and Levy (2004). Research in this area indicates that locus of control has been a useful concept for researchers in cross-cultural psychology.|$|E
