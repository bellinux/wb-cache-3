40|$|This paper {{describes}} a multilayer localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) graphene biosensor {{that includes a}} layer of graphene sheet {{on top of the}} gold layer, and the use of different coupled configuration of a laser beam. The study also investigates the enhancement of the sensitivity and detection accuracy of the biosensor through monitoring biomolecular interactions of biotin-streptavidin with the graphene layer on the gold thin film. Additionally, the role of thin films of gold, silver, copper and aluminum in the performance of the biosensor is separately investigated for monitoring the binding of streptavidin to the biotin groups. The performance of the LSPR graphene biosensor is theoretically and numerically assessed in terms of sensitivity, adsorption efficiency, and detection accuracy under varying conditions, including the thickness of biomolecule layer, number of graphene layers and operating wavelength. Enhanced sensitivity and improved adsorption efficiency are obtained for the LSPR graphene biosensor in comparison with its conventional counterpart; however, detection accuracy under the same resonance condition is reduced by 5. 2 % with a single graphene sheet. This reduction in detection accuracy (signal to noise ratio) can be compensated for by introducing an additional layer of silica doped B 2 O 3 (sdB 2 O 3) placed under the graphene layer. The role of prism configuration, <b>prism</b> <b>angle</b> and the interface medium (air and water) is also analyzed and it is found that the LSPR graphene biosensor has better sensitivity with triangular prism, higher <b>prism</b> <b>angle,</b> lower operating wavelength and larger number of graphene layers.

Numerical simulations using the Ansoft HFSS T " software package, lead {{to an understanding of}} the currents induced on a single S-ring due to a plane wave excitation.

The far field radiation for a pair of S-rings is determined using this vector current moment. The refraction of a plane wave travelling from a prism made up of S-rings into free-space is studied. In order to determine the far field radiation due to a prism made up of S-rings, the array factor specific to the prism structure is determined first.

40|$|The common {{camera lens}} usually {{includes}} the spherical glass/plastic lens and aspheric glass/plastic lens. However, spherical/aspheric shape measurement {{is still a}} key problem {{in the process of}} optical lens fabrication. At present, the in-process measurement of spherical/aspheric shape is conducted mainly by the probe-contacting method. But after a long time, its probe could be scratched severely and cause some big errors. Laser shearing interferometry is a good substitute to some degree. Nevertheless, it is not convenient for general shearing interferometer to carry out the in-process measurement because it is only suitable for certain kind of spherical/aspheric with respect to aperture or asperity. Here a new lateral shearing interferometer is proposed to solve the described problems. It is based on two Jarnin plates and rotatable prism pairs which are used not only for shearing displacement and direction, but also for fringe period and tilt degree, in order to meet requirements of various spherical/aspheric shapes or asperities. The new interferometer features a simple optical structure and two symmetric light paths, which makes its system with minimal error. The relation between shearing displacement, fringe period and <b>prism</b> <b>angle</b> of rotation is given in this paper. And the error source is primarily from the manufacture errors of prisms and plates. The final experiments show that one can achieve good-quality fringe patterns according to the requirement of measurement, concerning the shearing direction, shearing displacement, fringe period, tilt degree, etc. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

40|$|The Fourier {{transform}} infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflectance spectra give {{a direct}} {{proof that the}} Si surface remains covered by Si-H bonds {{in spite of the}} high etching rate in alkaline solutions. It confirms the chemical mechanism of the etching of silicon in such solutions where hydrolysis of Si-H and Si-Si bonds controls the kinetics. On the basis of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and elec-trochemical experiments a mechanism of the etching of silicon in NaOH solutions was recently derived which included the assump-tion that the surface is terminated by Si-H bonds and that this structure is preserved during the etching process. 1, 2 The stability of the hydrogenated Si surface was demonstrated after the removal of oxide layers on silicon by etching in hydrofluoric acid 3 - 5 where the dissolution of the silicon in the absence of oxygen stops at open circuit after the removal of the oxide. The hydrogenated surface remains stable in such solutions even during slow corrosion 6, 7 The dissolution of silicon proceeds, however, rapidly in NaOH solutions at open circuit. ~' 2 ~ 8 The final product of the dissolution is a silicate ion. Since the Si-OH bond is more stable that the Si-H bond, it could be suspected that the surface might be converted into a hydroxi-lated state at high etching rates.

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis {{has been carried out}} in the following two areas of Optical metrology: 1. Measurement and correction of prism angles 2. Measurement of refractive indices using a spectrograph. The prism angles are conventionally tested by mechanical bevel protractors, autocol-limators (angle dekkors), simple interference techniques and interferometers. All these methods have their own limitations either in accuracy or in terms of cost. Mechanical methods are usually employed to measure the angles of prisms. Interference techniques and interferometers are also used but they need optically polished components. For both mechanical and simple interference methods of testing, it is essential to fabricate more than a single component in number. The process of building interferometers or purchasing interferometers, angle dekkors and standard angle gauges is not cost effective for many research laboratories, and medium scale industries. To overcome these difficulties simple and inexpensive methods without sacrificing the accuracy in the bargain are suggested for the measurement of prism angles, based on the principles of reflection of light. The refractive indices of prism materials for invisible and weaker spectral lines are usually determined from spectrograms using dispersion formulae and numerical interpolation techniques. In these methods, the accuracy of the results depends on the accuracy of determining the constants of the dispersion formulae. A simple experimental technique, using a spectrograph, is devised for the measurement of refractive indices of solids and liquids both for visible and invisible spectral lines (wavelengths). The thesis has been divided into six chapters. The first chapter starts with the general introduction. The second chapter presents the literature review of the existing methods for angle and refractive index measurements.

50|$|An Amici prism, {{named for}} the {{astronomer}} Giovanni Amici, {{is a type of}} compound dispersive prism used in spectrometers. The Amici prism consists of two triangular prisms in contact, with the first typically being made from a medium-dispersion crown glass, and the second a higher-dispersion flint glass. Light entering the first prism is refracted at the first air-glass interface, refracted again at the interface between the two prisms, and then exits the second prism at near-normal incidence. The <b>prism</b> <b>angles</b> and materials are chosen such that one wavelength (colour) of light, the centre wavelength, exits the prism parallel to (but offset from) the entrance beam. The prism assembly is thus a direct-vision prism, and is commonly used as such in hand-held spectroscopes. Other wavelengths are deflected at angles depending on the glass dispersion of the materials. Looking at a light source through the prism thus shows the optical spectrum of the source.|$|R

50|$|Unpolarized {{light ray}} enters through the left {{face of the}} crystal, {{as shown in the}} diagram, and is split into two orthogonally polarized, {{differently}} directed rays by the birefringence property of the calcite. The ordinary ray, or o-ray, experiences a refractive index of no = 1.658 in the calcite and undergoes total internal reflection at the calcite-glue interface because its angle of incidence at the glue layer (refractive index n = 1.55) exceeds the critical angle for the interface. It passes out the top side of the upper half of the prism with some refraction, as shown. The extraordinary ray, or e-ray, experiences a lower refractive index (ne = 1.486) in the calcite and is not totally reflected at the interface because it strikes the interface at a sub-critical angle. The e-ray merely undergoes a slight refraction, or bending, as it passes through the interface into {{the lower half of the}} prism. It finally leaves the prism as a ray of plane-polarized light, undergoing another refraction, as it exits the far right side of the prism. The two exiting rays have polarizations orthogonal (at right angles) to each other, but the lower, or e-ray, is the more commonly used for further experimentation because it is again traveling in the original horizontal direction, assuming that the calcite <b>prism</b> <b>angles</b> have been properly cut. The direction of the upper ray, or o-ray, is quite different from its original direction because it alone suffers total internal reflection at the glue interface, as well as a final refraction on exit from the upper side of the prism.|$|R
