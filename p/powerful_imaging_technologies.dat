40|$|Recent {{advances}} in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnostic methods, including sensitive and specific biomarkers and computed tomography (CT) /magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologies, and therapeutic strategies, such as surgical resection techniques and local ablation methods, {{have increased the}} 5 -year survival rate of HCC to 63. 4 %. However, early diagnosis remains a clinical challenge in China, and only 20 %~ 30 % of cases are suitable for surgical resection upon diagnosis. To improve early diagnosis rates, screening for serum tumor markers should be increased, along with more frequent ultrasound examinations of high-risk individuals, such as those infected with hepatitis virus. In addition, the high-risk populations should be evaluated by more <b>powerful</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>technologies,</b> such as the three-phase dynamic contrast-enhanced CT and the gadopentetic acid (Gd-DTPA) contrast-enhanced MRI. Upon diagnosis, several aspects of patient management should be enhanced to promote better outcome; specifically, a multidisciplinary consultation approach should be developed to help the patient understand the disease process and healthcare providers to develop effective individualized treatment programs. Collectively, improvements in early diagnosis and patient management will not only help to reduce the rate of late-stage hepatic failure but also improve the overall survival of HCC patients...|$|E

We refer to this method as Speckle-Free OCT (SFOCT).

It enables in situ. 3 D visualization of tissue structure and pathology, without the need. to excise the tissue and resolution approaching that of histology. OCT {{has had the}} most clinical impact in ophthalmology, where it provides structural and quantit ative informat ion that cannot be obtained by any other modality. The objective of the work presented in this thesis was {{the development of new}} imaging methods and optical devices to progress the OCT technology in t erms of its versatility, as well as to improve on parameters such as resolution, wavelength availability, integration effort and reliability. One of the most desired features in high resolution imaging is the display of simultaneously generated confocal images. The implementation of a confocal channel at the core of an OCT with quasi-simultaneous display of both images is demonstrated by synchronous optical switching of the power in the reference arm of the interferometer with the scanner determining the line in the final raster. The 1. 0 - 1. 1 11 m region of the optical spectrum emerged as an attractive option compared to the standard 700 - 900 nm region, due to increased penetration beyond the retina, into the choroid, and reduced scat tering. Therefore, in this thesis, two novel optical sources based on fiber optic technology at 1 micrometer have been researched, assembled and tested: (a) a broadband ASE source based on combination of Yb-doped and Nd-doped silica fibers. The source emits at a cent ral wavelength of 1060 nm with a full-width-halfmaximum exceeding 70 nrn and 20 m output power; and (b) a swept fiber laser source emitting at 1065 nm central wavelength, with :::::l 50 nm tuning range and 40 m Woutput average power.

40|$|Abstract: Visualization of Cortex Organization and Dynamics in Microorganisms, using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence MicroscopyTIRF {{microscopy}} {{has emerged}} as a <b>powerful</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>technology</b> to study spatio-temporal dynamics of fluorescent molecules in vitro and in living cells 1. The optical phenomenon of total internal reflection occurs when light passes from a medium with high refractive index into a medium with low refractive index at an angle larger than a characteristic critical angle (i. e. closer to being parallel with the boundary). Although all light is reflected back under such conditions, an evanescent wave is created that propagates across and along the boundary, which decays exponentially with distance, and only penetrates sample areas that are 100 - 200 nm near the interface 2. In addition to providing superior axial resolution, the reduced excitation of out of focus fluorophores creates a very high signal to noise ratios and minimizes damaging effects of photobleaching 2, 3. Being a widefield technique, TIRF also allows faster image acquisition than most scanning based confocal setups. At first glance, the low penetration depth of TIRF seems to be incompatible with imaging of bacterial and fungal cells, which are often surrounded by thick cell walls. On the contrary, we have found that the cell walls of yeast and bacterial cells actually improve the usability of TIRF and increase the range of observable structures 4 - 8. Many cellular processes can therefore be directly accessed by TIRF in small, single-cell microorganisms, which often offer powerful genetic manipulation techniques. This allows us to perform in vivo biochemistry experiments, where kinetics of protein interactions and activities can be directly assessed in living cells. We describe here the individual steps required to obtain high quality TIRF images for Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Bacillus subtilis cells. We point out various problems that can affect TIRF visualization of fluorescent probes in cells and illustrate the procedure with several application examples. Finally, we demonstrate how TIRF images can be further improved using established image restoration techniques...|$|R

Edema toxin (ET), but not lethal toxin (LT), markedly modified the patterns of bacterial dissemination leading, to apparent direct dissemination to the spleen and provoking apoptosis of lymphoid cells. Each toxin alone provoked particular histological lesions in the spleen. When ET and LT are produced together during infection, a specific temporal pattern of lesion developed, with early lesions typical of LT, followed at a later stage by lesions typical of ET. Our study provides new insights into the complex spatial and temporal effects of B. anthracis toxins in the infected host, suggesting a greater role than previously suspected for ET in anthrax and suggesting that therapeutic targeting of ET contributes to protection...|$|R
40|$|Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated {{disorder}} {{of the central}} nervous system that results in destruction of the myelin sheath that surrounds axons and eventual neurodegeneration. Current treatments approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS target the aberrant immune response and successfully reduce the severity of attacks and frequency of relapses. Therapies are still needed that can repair damage particularly for the treatment of progressive forms of MS for which current therapies are relatively ineffective. Remyelination can restore neuronal function and prevent further neuronal loss and clinical disability. Recent advancements in our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating myelination, as well as the development of high throughput screens to identify agents that enhance myelination, have lead to the identification of many potential remyelination therapies currently in pre-clinical and early clinical development.

40|$|Abstract — Bioluminescence {{tomography}} (BLT) is a <b>powerful</b> molecular <b>imaging</b> <b>technology</b> {{designed for}} the localization and quantification of bioluminescent sources in vivo. With the for-ward process modeled by the diffusion approximation equation, BLT is the inverse problem to reconstruct the distribution of in-ternal bioluminescent sources subject to Cauchy data. Due to the non-uniqueness of BLT in general, adequate prior informa-tion such as nonnegativity and source support constraints must be utilized to obtain a physically favorable BLT solution. Itera-tive algorithms such as the well-known Expectation Maximiza-tion (EM) algorithm and the Landweber algorithm which are suitable for incorporating these knowledge-based constraints are widely used in practice. In the current work, we investi-gate {{the application of a}} superiorization-like approach to BLT. A superiorization-like version of prototypical iterative algorithms for BLT in a general framework, denoted by S-BLT, is pre-sented. For the EM algorithm as the underlying iterative algo-rithms for BLT and S-BLT, superiorized by the total variation (TV) merit function, preliminary simulation results for a het-erogeneous phantom are reported to demonstrate the viability of the approach and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. It is found that total variation superiorization of BLT can significantly improve the visualization effect of the recon-struction with the sources set as a particular case of radial basis functions...|$|R

One of the technological challenges impairing faster adoption of OCT is the relative complexity of the corresponding optical instrumentation, which translates into expensive and bulky setups. In this paper a compact fastscanning optical delay line based on the thermo-optical effect of silicon is studied. Although this effect {{has been applied to}} other optical components, the necessary frequency behaviour together with the relatively large scanning range required are unique to the application. Cycling speeds of over 1 kHz and ranges of more than 1 mm are needed for videorate acquisition of relevant tissue volumes. A structure is proposed to meet these specifications. A bulk micro machined freestanding waveguide is connected to the substrate by means of evenly spaced support beams. It is shown by means of the Finite Element Method that the geometrical parameters of the beams modulate the thermal behaviour of the waveguide. A linear trade-off between maximum working frequency and power dissipation for any given waveguide size and required scanning range has been found.
