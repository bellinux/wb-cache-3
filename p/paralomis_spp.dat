40|$|Between March 2000 and April 2001 two {{commercial}} fishing vessels fished for toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) off South Georgia using pots. A {{significant number of}} lithodid crabs (three species of <b>Paralomis</b> <b>spp.)</b> were caught as bycatch. Paralomis spinosissima occurred in shallow water, generally shallower than 700 m. Paralomis anamerae, not previously reported from this area and therefore representing a considerable southerly extension in the reported geographic range of this species, had an intermediate depth distribution from 400 to 800 m. Paralomis formosa was present in shallow waters but reached much higher catch levels (and, presumably, densities) between 800 and 1400 m. Differences were also noted in depth distribution of the sexes and size of crabs. Depth, soak time, and area were found to significantly influence crab catch rates. Few crabs (3 % of P. spinosissima and 7 % of P. formosa) were males above the legal size limit and could therefore be retained. All other crabs were discarded. Most crabs (> 99 % of P. formosa, > 97 % of P. spinosissima, and > 90 % of P. anamerae) were lively on arrival on deck and at subsequent discard. Mortality rates estimated from re-immersion experiments indicated that on the vessel where pots were emptied directly onto the factory conveyor belt 78 – 89 % of crabs would survive discarding, whereas on the vessel where crabs were emptied down a vertical chute prior to being sorted, survivorship was 38 – 58 %. Of the three, P. anamerae was the most vulnerable to handling onboard and sub-sequent discarding. Paralomis spinosissima seemed more vulnerable than P. formosa...|$|E
