40|$|This article {{compares the}} use of risk-increasing and {{risk-reducing}} production inputs with the experimentally measured risk attitudes of farmers. For this purpose, the Just-Pope production function indicates production inputs' influence on output risk and a Holt-Laury lottery is {{used to measure the}} <b>producer</b> 4 <b>s</b> <b>risk</b> attitude. We test whether more risk averse farmers use more risk-reducing and less risk-increasing production inputs. Therefore, we apply a unique data set which includes 185 small-scale farmers which are producing rubber on 260 plots on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. The Just-Pope production function indicates that fertiliser usage has a risk-reducing effect, whereas herbicide usage and plot size have risk-increasing effects. For labour and plantation age, the influence on output risk is ambiguous. By including the outcome of a Holt-Laury lottery into the analysis, we found the expected result that more risk averse farmers use more (risk-reducing) fertiliser and less (risk-increasing) herbicides. These consistent results provide an example for the external validity of measuring risk attitude with the Holt-Laury lottery...|$|R

The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to examine the impact of the existence of the audit committees to the relationship between company 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>risk</b> and conservatism accounting.

The testing of hypothesis in this research is used moderated regression analysis (MRA). The result of hypothesis test indicated that audit committees affect the positive relationship between company 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>risk</b> and conservatism accounting. The higher of the company 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>risk,</b> then the audit committee will recommend the application of conservative accounting.
