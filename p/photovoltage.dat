50|$|Surface <b>photovoltage</b> {{measurements}} are performed {{by placing a}} wafer or sheet film of a semiconducting material on a ground electrode and positioning a kelvin probe a small distance above the sample. The surface is illuminated with light whose wavelength is scanned using a monochromator so as to vary the absorption depth of the photons. The deeper in the semiconductor that carrier generation occurs, the fewer the number of minority carriers that will reach the surface and the smaller the <b>photovoltage.</b> On a semiconductor whose spectral absorption coefficient is known, the minority carrier diffusion length can in principle be extracted from a measurement of <b>photovoltage</b> versus wavelength. The optical properties of a novel semiconduct{{or may not be}} well known or may not be homogeneous across the sample.

40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) devices {{based on}} PbS quantum dot (QD) solids {{demonstrate}} high photontoelectron conversion yields. However, record {{power conversion efficiency}} remain low, {{in part due to}} small <b>photovoltages,</b> which in turn are affected by both bulk and interfacial defects. Their relative impacts on limiting the photovoltaic performance of QD solids are not known. Interfacial defects can be formed when contacting a semiconductor and may dominate the semiconductor/metal or metaloxide junction properties. The objective {{of this study is to}} explore whether electrochemical contacting using liquid electrolytes provides means of contacting QD solids without introducing interfacial defects. We have initially focused on the relationship between <b>photovoltages</b> of QD solids and energetics of the contacting electrolytes. We have investigated electrochemical contacting of PbS QD solids using anhydrous liquid electrolytes containing fast, outersphere redox couples. Depending on the energetics of a redox couple, rectifying or nonrectifying PbS QD solid/electrolyte junctions were formed. Results were consistent with electrochemical contacting being a “soft” contacting method that did not introduce interfacial defects as the opencircuit voltage (Voc) varied ideally with solution potential (E), ΔVoc/ΔE = 1. 08 ± 0. 04.

Assuming a faradaic efficiency of 100 %, this corresponds to a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 9. 5 %.

40|$|The present work {{reports a}} simple and direct {{sputtering}} deposition to form solid state TiO 2 |Ag independent plasmonic solar cells. The independent plasmonic solar cells {{are based on a}} Schottky barrier between two materials, TiO 2 and Ag. The Ag functions as the absorber generating “hot” electrons, as well as the contact for the solar cell. The Ag sputtering is performed for different durations, to form Ag nanoparticles with a wide size distribution on the surface of rough spray pyrolysis deposited TiO 2. Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) measurements show photovoltaic activity below the TiO 2 bandgap, which is caused by the silver nanoparticles that have a wide plasmonic band, leading to the generation of “hot” electrons. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis supports the “hot” electron injection mechanism by following the Ag plasmon band and detecting local <b>photovoltages.</b> The measurements show that electrons are formed in the Ag upon illumination and are injected into the TiO 2, producing photovoltaic activity. J–V measurements show photocurrents up to 1. 18 mA cm− 2 and <b>photovoltages</b> up to 430 mV are achieved, with overall efficiencies of 0. 2 %.

50|$|When photogenerated {{electrons}} and holes have different mobilities, a potential difference {{can be created}} between the illuminated and non-illuminated faces of a semiconductor slab. Generally this potential is created through {{the depth of the}} slab, whether it is a bulk semiconductor or a polycrystalline film. The difference between these cases is that in the latter, a <b>photovoltage</b> can be created in each one of the microcrystallites. As was mentioned above, in the oblique deposition process inclined crystallites are formed in which one face can absorb light more than the other. This may cause a <b>photovoltage</b> to be generated along the film, as well as through its depth. The transfer of carriers at the surface of crystallites is assumed to be hindered by the presence of some unspecified layer with different properties, thus cancellation of consecutive Dember voltages is being prevented. To explain the polarity of the PV which is independent of the illumination direction one must assume that there exists a large difference in recombination rates at opposite faces of a crystallite, which is a weakness of this model.|$|E

50|$|The {{interface}} between crystallites may contain traps for charge carriers. This {{may lead to}} a surface charge and an opposite space charge region in the crystallites, in case that the crystallites are small enough. Under illumination of the inclined crystallites electron-hole pairs are generated and cause a compensation of the charge in the surface and within the crystallites. If it is assumed that the optical absorption depth is much less than the space charge region in the crystallites, then, because of their inclined shape more light is absorbed in one side than in the other.
