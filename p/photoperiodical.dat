40|$|Cuscuta reflexa {{presents}} some {{advantages for}} <b>photoperiodical</b> studies, {{it has a}} critical day length of 12 hours and flowers "in vitro" by induction of stem tips with buds. Being a parasite plant {{it is a good}} object studying the role of nutrition in flowering process. The questions studied here are: the length of minimal induction, the persistence of induction and the existence of endogenous rhythm (using cycles longer than 24 hours) ...|$|E
40|$|Nodal roots (NRs) {{constitute}} the prevalent root system of adult maize plants. NRs emerge from stem nodes located below or above ground, and {{little is known}} about their inducing factors. Here, it is shown that precocious development of NRs at the coleoptilar node (NRCNs) occurred in maize seedlings when: (i) dark grown and stimulated by the concurrent action of a single light shock of low intensity white light (2 [*]μmol m− 2 s− 1) and a single heat shock; (ii) grown under a photoperiod of low intensity light (0. 1 [*]μmol m− 2 s− 1); or (iii) grown in the dark under a thermoperiod (28 [*]°C/ 34 [*]°C). The light shock effects were synergistic with heat shock and with the photoperiod, whereas the thermoperiodical and <b>photoperiodical</b> effects were additive. Dissection of the primary root or the root cap, to mimic the fatal consequences of severe heat shock, caused negligible effects on NRCN formation, indicating that the shoot is directly involved in perception of the heat shock-inducible signal that triggered NRCN formation. A comparison between hsp 101 -m 5 ::Mu 1 /hsp 101 -m 5 ::Mu 1 and Hsp 101 /Hsp 101 seedlings indicated that the heat shock protein 101 (HSP 101) chaperone inhibited NRCN formation in the light and in the dark. Stimulation of precocious NRCN formation by light and heat shocks was affected by genetic background and by the stage of seedling development. HSP 101 protein levels increased in the coleoptilar node of induced wild-type plants, particularly in the procambial region, where NRCN formation originated. The adaptive relevance of development of NRCNs in response to these environmental cues and hypothetical mechanisms of regulation by HSP 101 are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} Mixed {{structural}} covariance, Path and Cultivation Value analyses and the CERES-Wheat crop model {{were used to}} evaluate vegetation and yield component variation affecting yield potential between different high-latitude (> 60 ° N lat.) and mid-European (< 60 ° N lat.) spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes currently cultivated in southern Finland. Path modeling {{results from this study}} suggest that especially grains/ear, harvest index (HI) and maximum 1000 kernel weight were significant factors defining the highest yield potential. Mixed and Cultivation value modeling results suggest that when compared with genotypes introduced for cultivation before 1990 s, modern spring wheat genotypes have a significantly higher yielding capacity, current high yielding mid-European genotypes even exceeding the 5 t ha- 1 non-potential baseline yield level (yb). Because of a forthcoming climate change, the new high yielding wheat genotypes have to adapt for elevated temperatures and atmospheric CO 2  growing conditions in northern latitudes. The optimized ideotype profiles derived from the generic high-latitude and mid-European genotypes are presented in the results. High-latitude and mid-European ideotype profiles with factors estimating the effects of concurrent elevated CO 2 and temperature levels with <b>photoperiodical</b> daylength effects can be utilized when designing future high yielding ideotypes adapted to future growing conditions. The CERES-Wheat ideotype modeling results imply, that with new high yielding mid-European ideotypes, the non-potential baseline yield (yb) would be on average 5150 kg ha- 1 level (+ 108 %) vs. new high-latitude ideotypes (yb 4770 kg ha- 1, 100 %) grown under the elevated CO 2 (700 ppm) ×temperature(+ 3 ºC) growing conditions projected by the year 2100 climate change scenario in southern Finland...|$|E
