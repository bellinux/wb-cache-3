25|$|Some medical {{systems have}} a {{practice}} of routinely performing chest x-rays before surgery. The premise behind this practice is that the physician might discover some unknown medical condition which would complicate the surgery, and that upon discovering this with the chest x-ray, the physician would adapt the surgery practice accordingly. In fact, medical specialty professional organizations recommend against routine pre-operative chest x-rays for patients who have an unremarkable medical history and presented with a physical exam which did not indicate a chest x-ray. Routine x-ray examination {{is more likely to}} result in problems like misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or other negative outcomes than it is to result in a benefit to the patient.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} horses with {{atrial fibrillation}} for hypercoagulability; plasma D-dimer concentrations, {{as a marker}} of a procoagulant state; and a relationship between coagulation profile results and duration of atrial fibrillation or presence of structural heart disease. DESIGN Case-control study. ANIMALS Plasma samples from 42 horses (25 with atrial fibrillation and 17 without cardiovascular or systemic disease [control group]). PROCEDURES Results of hematologic tests (ie, plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer concentrations, prothrombin and activated <b>partial</b> <b>thromboplastin</b> <b>times,</b> and antithrombin activity) in horses were recorded to assess coagulation and fibrinolysis. Historical and clinical variables, as associated with a hypercoagulable state in other species, were also recorded. RESULTS Horses with atrial fibrillation and control horses lacked clinical signs of hypercoagulation or thromboembolism. Compared with control horses, horses with atrial fibrillation had significantly lower antithrombin activity. No significant differences in plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer concentrations and prothrombin and activated <b>partial</b> <b>thromboplastin</b> <b>times</b> existed between horse groups. In horses with atrial fibrillation versus control horses, a significantly larger proportion had an abnormal plasma D-dimer concentration (10 / 25 vs 2 / 17), test results indicative of subclinical activated coagulation (18 / 25 vs 6 / 17), or abnormal coagulation test results (25 / 121 vs 7 / 85), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Horses with atrial fibrillation did not have clinical evidence of a hypercoagulable state, but {{a higher proportion of}} horses with atrial fibrillation, compared with control horses, did have subclinical activated coagulation on the basis of standard coagulation test results...|$|R
50|$|Definitive {{diagnosis}} is usually {{made at a}} reference laboratory with advanced biocontainment capabilities. The findings of laboratory investigation vary somewhat between the viruses but in general there is {{a decrease in the}} total white cell count (particularly the lymphocytes), a decrease in the platelet count, an increase in the blood serum liver enzymes, and reduced blood clotting ability measured as an increase in both the prothrombin (PT) and activated <b>partial</b> <b>thromboplastin</b> <b>times</b> (PTT).

40|$|Severe fever with {{thrombocytopenia}} syndrome (SFTS) is {{an emerging}} infectious disease that was recently identified in China, South Korea and Japan. The {{objective of the}} study was to evaluate the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of SFTS in South Korea. SFTS is a reportable disease in South Korea. We included all SFTS cases reported to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) from January 2013 to December 2015. Clinical information was gathered by reviewing medical records, and epidemiologic characteristics were analyzed using both KCDC surveillance data and patient medical records. Risk factors for mortality in patients with SFTS were assessed. A total of 172 SFTS cases were reported during the study period. SFTS occurred throughout the country, except in urban areas. Hilly areas in the eastern and southeastern regions and Jeju island (incidence, 1. 26 cases / 105 person-years) were the main endemic areas. The yearly incidence increased from 36 cases in 2013 to 81 cases in 2015. Most cases occurred from May to October. The overall case fatality ratio was 32. 6 %. The clinical progression was similar to the 3 phases reported in China: fever, multi-organ dysfunction, and convalescence. Confusion, elevated C-reactive protein, and prolonged activated <b>partial</b> <b>thromboplastin</b> <b>times</b> were associated with mortality in patients with SFTS. Two outbreaks of nosocomial SFTS transmission were observed. SFTS is an endemic disease in South Korea, with a nationwide distribution and a high case-fatality ratio.
