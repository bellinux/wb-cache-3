5|$|For {{the three}} {{sections}} of the ride where wrap-around <b>projection</b> is used, each robotic arm continues its steady movement on the track but is met by its own individual parabolic <b>projection</b> screen and projector traveling {{at exactly the same}} pace. Each <b>projection</b> section uses a huge turntable with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each robotic arm as they pass by - and each screen is large enough that when in front of each ride bench its edges cannot be seen. The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets. The robotic arms can then freely dive, turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area, giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the <b>projection,</b> whilst the base of the arm on the track simply follows the slow circular path that each screen takes as it revolves. This is why each <b>projection</b> section of the ride is approximately the same length, as each ride arm must follow each identically-sized <b>projection</b> screen turntable for a set period of time.|$|E

Specifically, general fund revenues are just $ 21, 484 or 0. 12 % above lowered <b>projections.</b> <b>Projections</b> in several categories have been reduced from the original 2010 budget. We will continue to closely monitor all general fund revenue to ensure that current revenue <b>projections</b> are accurate. In other non-general fund revenues the two most significant trends are that real estate excise tax revenue continues to lag behind <b>projections,</b> but fuel tax is slightly ahead of <b>projections</b> and is running higher than 2009. Actual expenditures through September are below <b>projections</b> in four of the City’s primary funds: General Fund is below <b>projections</b> by 4. 4 %; Street Fund is below <b>projections</b> by 6. 1 %; General Capital Fund is below <b>projections</b> by 5. 0 %, and the Surface Water Utility Fund is below <b>projections</b> by 20. 0 %.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} the numerical <b>projections</b> of macroeconomic indicators {{carried out by}} the World Bank country teams during the Unified Survey. The Unified Survey is an annual data collection mechanism that gathers historical as well as <b>projections</b> data. This study looks at the accuracy of short-term <b>projections</b> i. e. <b>projections</b> for the current year, first year and <b>projections</b> for three-years ahead for a group of 23 countries spread over the different regions in the World Bank. The study shows that the accuracy of the <b>projections</b> has improved over time. In addition the study compares the US <b>projections</b> with the IMF’s <b>projections</b> done for its fall World Economic Outlook. The US <b>projections</b> are as accurate as — or more accurate than — the WEO <b>projections.</b> The findings, interpretations, and conclusions expressed in this paper are entirely those of the author. They do not necessarily represent the views of the World Bank. I would like to thank especially Jean Adams fo...|$|R

5|$|Mercator's {{editions of}} Ptolemy and his {{theological}} writings were in print {{for many years}} after {{the demise of the}} atlas but they too eventually disappeared and it was the Mercator <b>projection</b> which emerged as his sole and greatest legacy. His construction of a chart on which the courses of constant bearing favoured by mariners appeared as straight lines ultimately revolutionised the art of navigation, making it simpler and therefore safer. Mercator left no hints to his method of construction and it was Edward Wright who first clarified the method in his book Certaine Errors (1599)—the relevant error being the erroneous belief that straight lines on conventional charts corresponded to constant courses. Wright's solution was a numerical approximation and it was another 70 years before the <b>projection</b> formula was derived analytically. Wright published a new world map based on the Mercator <b>projection,</b> also in 1599. Slowly, but steadily, charts using the <b>projection</b> appeared throughout {{the first half of the}} seventeenth century and by the end of that century chart makers all over the world were using nothing but the Mercator <b>projection,</b> with the aim of showing the oceans and the coastlines in detail without concern for the continental interiors. At some stage the <b>projection</b> made the unfortunate leap to portrayal of the continents and it eventually became the canonical description of the world, despite its manifest distortions at high latitudes. Recently Mercator's <b>projection</b> has been rejected for representations of the world but it remains paramount for nautical charts and its use stands as his enduring legacy.|$|E

5|$|Tarbosaurus lacked these bony struts, and the {{connection}} between the nasals and lacrimals was weak. Instead, a backwards <b>projection</b> of the maxilla was massively developed in Tarbosaurus and fit inside a sheath formed from the lacrimal. This <b>projection</b> was a thin, bony plate in North American tyrannosaurids. The large backwards <b>projection</b> suggests that force was transmitted more directly from the maxilla to the lacrimal in Tarbosaurus. The lacrimal was also more firmly anchored to the frontal and prefrontal bones in Tarbosaurus. The well-developed connections between the maxilla, lacrimal, frontal and prefrontal would have made its entire upper jaw more rigid.|$|E

5|$|Tbr1, {{along with}} Pax6 and Tbr2, {{has a role}} in glutamatergic <b>projection</b> neuron differentiation. Glutamatergic neurons make and release in an activity-dependent manner the {{excitatory}} neurotransmitter glutamate {{as opposed to the}} inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The transition from radial glial cells to postmitotic <b>projection</b> neurons occurs in three steps, each associated with one of the aforementioned transcription factors. The first starts out with the expression of Pax6 in radial glial cells found primarily at the ventricular surface. In the next step, Pax6 is downregulated and Tbr2 is expressed as the cell differentiates into an intermediate progenitor cell. Likewise, in the final step, Tbr2 is extremely downregulated to undetectable levels as Tbr1 signals the transition into a postmitotic <b>projection</b> neuron.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} {{aspect of the}} book was Wright's method for dividing the meridian; an explanation of how he had constructed a table for the division; and the uses of this information for navigation. Essentially, the problem that occupied Wright was how to depict accurately a globe on a two-dimensional map according to the <b>projection</b> used by Gerardus Mercator in his map of 1569. Mercator's <b>projection</b> was advantageous for nautical purposes as it represented lines of constant true bearing or true course, known as loxodromes or rhumb lines, as straight lines.

40|$|Animals {{sometimes}} develop conspicuous <b>projections</b> on or {{near their}} heads as, e. g., weap-onry, burrowing or digging tools, and probes to search for resources. The frontal <b>projections</b> that insects generally use to locate and assess resources are segmented appendages, including antennae, maxillary palps, and labial palps. There {{is no evidence to}} date that arthropods, including insects, use <b>projections</b> other than true segmental appendages to locate food. In this regard, it is noteworthy that some butterfly larvae possess a pair of long antenna-like <b>projections</b> {{on or near}} their heads. To date, the function of these <b>projections</b> has not been established. Larvae of pipevine swallowtail butterflies Battus philenor (Papilio-nidae) have a pair of long frontal fleshy <b>projections</b> that, like insect antennae generally, can be actively moved.

He also compares the Unified Survey <b>projections</b> with the International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) <b>projections</b> for its fall World Economic Outlook (WEO). He finds that: 1) The Unified Survey <b>projections</b> are inaccurate when evaluated over the whole period investigated (1990 - 96). However, their accuracy has improved over time. 2) Improvements are notable in <b>projections</b> for investment, GDP inflation, and government deficit. <b>Projections</b> of external indicators - such as import and export growth - are still substantially inaccurate and should be greatly improved. 3) The Unified Survey <b>projections</b> are as accurate as - or more accurate than - the WEO <b>projections.</b> 4) One cannot characterize the United Survey <b>projections</b> as optimistic.
