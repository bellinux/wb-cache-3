40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether gonad shields are correctly positioned on <b>the</b> pelvic radiographs <b>of</b> children with slipped capital femoral epiphysis. DESIGN [...] Retrospective study of radiographs taken of children treated by in situ pinning of slipped capital femoral epiphysis between 1 January 1983 and 31 December 1988. SETTING [...] Three teaching hospitals in north west England. PATIENTS [...] 32 patients with {{complete set of}} radiographs. RESULTS [...] An average of 10. 8 anteroposterior pelvic radiographs plus 8. 9 lateral hip radiographs had been performed per patient. Gonad shields had been completely omitted in 137 (40 %) anteroposterior pelvic radiographs performed on the 32 patients at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study. In 100 (29 %) <b>the</b> gonad <b>shields</b> were adequately protecting the gonads, but in 109 (31 %) <b>the</b> gonad <b>shields</b> were not protecting the gonads due to incorrect <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shield.</b> <b>The</b> incorrect <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gonad <b>shields</b> was more commonly found in girls than boys (64 vs 45; p less than 0. 012), presumably because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> difficulty in determining gonadal position in relation to surface landmarks. Absence of gonad shields was also more commonly seen in girls (82 v 55; p less than 0. 005), {{but this is not}} easily explained. CONCLUSIONS [...] Gonad shields are not protecting the gonads in a large percentage of anteroposterior pelvic radiographs (71 %) because they have been omitted or inadequately placed. This avoidable excess radiation exposure to the gonads, combined with <b>the</b> inability to <b>shield</b> <b>the</b> gonads in lateral hip radiographs and <b>the</b> large number <b>of</b> radiographs performed, results in the gonads receiving a higher dose of radiation than may otherwise be the case, and may increase the potential for disease in <b>the</b> future offspring <b>of</b> these patients...|$|R

40|$|Background: Gonad {{shielding}} {{has been}} recommended during pelvic x-rays since the 1950 s. <b>The</b> popular method <b>of</b> gonad shielding is placement a lead <b>shield</b> in <b>the</b> midline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pelvis. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study was}} to evaluate the prevalence and utility of gonad shielding in pediatrics undergoing pelvic x-rays. Materials and MethodsFollowing study approval, we retrospectively retrieved data from the digital image library of ten radiology depertments of Khuzestan provience-Iran to identify pediatric patients who underwent pelvic x-ray (anteriorposterior [AP] view). All the images were reviewed for <b>the</b> probable evidence <b>of</b> gonad shield. If there was evidence <b>of</b> <b>shielding,</b> <b>the</b> accuracy <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shield</b> was also investigated by a single assistant radiologist. ResultsIn all 1745 pelvic x-rays (942 girls and 803 boys) were identified <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> <b>shield</b> was present in 51 (5. 41 %) radiographs of girls and 132 (16. 43 %) radiographs of boys. When a <b>shield</b> was present; <b>the</b> <b>shields</b> has adequate positioning only in 8 (15. 68 %) radiographs in girls and 59 radiographs in boys. Inaccurate placement and absence of gonad shields were more common in girls than the boys. Due to <b>the</b> <b>shield</b> has concealed <b>the</b> anatomical criteria <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pelvis, retakes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> examination was required in 11 (21. 56 %) radiographs of girls and 14 (10. 6 %) radiographs of boys. ConclusionThe current methods of gonad shielding in girls pelvic x-ray was not effective nor is justifiable. We  no longer advocate of gonad shielding during girls pelvic x-ray. However in boys it is controversial and depends on the skill and effort of radiographers...|$|R

40|$|During <b>the</b> {{investigation}} <b>of</b> current instabilities in semi-insulating single CdS crystals, {{caused by}} applying a high voltage pulse and using various illumination distributions, some completely new phenomena have been observed. The major phenomena are discussed and explanations {{have been offered}} for the observed effects with various types of illumination. Phenomena observed have been compared with <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> other workers. One type of instability was initiated by applying high voltage pulses to CdS specimens in complete darkness. It is observed from the field measurements that <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> oscillation is equal to <b>the</b> transit time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acoustic wave from <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> high field region to <b>the</b> anode end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specimen and {{not related to the}} wave transit time between electrodes. High frequency non-sinusodial electrical oscillations were observed in uniformly illuminated specimens. These were attributed to <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> longitudinal potential gradients which were found when the electric field was measured under oscillatory conditions. Continuous acousto-electric current oscillations were observed in a specimen by shading a length near to the anode end. Extremely high fields were detected in the high resistivity region so formed when amplification occurred. Obscuring a narrow strip perpendicular to <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sample and applying a high voltage pulse resulted in current oscillations and two step saturation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current. A number of oscillatory modes were often found in a specimen, depending on <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shielded</b> strip on <b>the</b> specimen. Extremely high electricfields were observed near <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obscured strip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specimen. In two-step current saturation phenomena the changes in current pulses were recorded. Low frequency current oscillations were observed after the current had fallen to a final steady value. <b>The</b> conductivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material at different times after <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> a high voltage pulse was recorded and it remained constant below threshold voltages and thereafter differed from the ohmic low voltage value. The electric field reached maximum values 0. 5 mm from the cathode and 1 mm from <b>the</b> anode ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specimen. High frequency non-sinusodial current oscillations were recorded by localised illumination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specimens with an He-Ne laser beam.

40|$|A palaeomagnetic {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out <b>of</b> rocks from <b>the</b> eastern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Voronezh Massif, which constitutes, together with <b>the</b> Ukrainian <b>Shield,</b> <b>the</b> Sarmatian segment in <b>the</b> southern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East European Craton. The samples were collected in a quarry close to <b>the</b> town <b>of</b> Pavlovsk (50. 4 °N, 40. 1 °E), where a syenitic-granitic body intrudes Archaean units. U–Pb (zircon) dating has yielded an age of 2080 Ma for the intrusion. Two characteristic magnetic components, A and B, were isolated by thermal and alternating-field demagnetization. Component A was obtained from granites and quartz syenites (11 samples) and has a mean direction of D= 229 °, I= 28 °, and a pole position at 12 °N, 172 °E. This pole is close to a contemporary mean pole (9 °N, 187 °E) for <b>the</b> Ukrainian <b>Shield,</b> which implies that the Voronezh Massif and <b>the</b> <b>Shield</b> constituted a single entity at 2. 06 Ga.

A component B, isolated only in quartz monzonites (five samples), has a mean direction D= 144 °, I= 49 °, and a pole position at 4 °N, 251 °E, which is close to late Sveconorwegian (approximately 900 Ma) poles for Baltica. This suggests that the East European Craton was consolidated some time between 2080 and 900 Ma. Comparison with other palaeomagnetic data permit us to narrow this time span to 1770 – 1340 Ma...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A novel slow-wave {{transmission}} line with optimized slot-type floating shields in advanced CMOS technology is pre-sented. Periodical slot-type floating shields are inserted beneath the {{transmission line}} to provide substrate shielding and to shorten the electromagnetic (EM) propagation wavelength. This is the first study that demonstrates how the wavelength, attenuation loss, and characteristic impedance can be adjusted by changing the strip length (SL), strip spacing (SS), and metal layer <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slot-type floating <b>shields.</b> Wavelength shortening needs to be achieved with a tradeoff between slow-wave effect and attenuation loss. <b>The</b> slot-type floating <b>shields</b> with different SLs, SSs and metal layer positions are analyzed. It is concluded that minimum SL provides the most optimal result. A design guideline can be established to enable circuit designers to reach the most appropriate slot-type floating shields for optimal circuit performance. Transmission line test structures were fabricated by using 45 -nm CMOS process technology. Both measurement and EM waves simulation were performed up to 50 GHz. Transmission lines are frequently used at a length of half- or quarter-wavelength. With a shortened wave-length, a saving in silicon area of more than 67 % {{can be achieved by}} using optimized slot-type floating shields. Experimental results demonstrated a higher effective relative permittivity value, which is improved by a factor of more than 9, and a better quality factor, which is improved by a factor of more than 6, as compared to conventional transmission lines.
