40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} highly hydrophilic soft contact lenses for <b>persistent</b> <b>corneal</b> epithelial defects. METHODS:In this retrospective case analysis, 28 patients(28 eyes) with <b>persistent</b> <b>corneal</b> epithelial defects after anterior segment surgery from January 2011 to June 2013 in our hospital were reviewed. After regular treatment for at least 2 wk, the <b>persistent</b> <b>corneal</b> epithelial defects were treated with highly hydrophilic soft contact lenses, until the corneal epithelial healing. Continued to wear the same lens no more than 3 wk, or in need of replacement the new one. All cases were followed up for 6 mo. Key indicators of corneal epithelial healling, corneal fluorescein staining and ocular symptoms improvement were observed. RESULTS: Twenty-one eyes were cured(75. 00 %), markedly effective in 5 eyes(17. 86 %), effective in 2 eyes(7. 14 %), no invalid cases, the total efficiency of 100. 00 %. Ocular symptoms of 25 cases(89. 29 %) relieved within 2 d, the rest 3 cases(10. 71 %) relieved within 1 wk. The corneal epithelial of 6 cases(21. 43 %) repaired in 3 wk, 13 cases(46. 43 %) in 6 wk, 7 cases(25. 00 %) in 9 wk, 2 cases(7. 14 %) over 12 wk. There were no signs of secondary infection. And no evidence of recurrence in 6 mo.

We report a case of a <b>persistent</b> <b>corneal</b> epithelial defect in a patient with diabetes treated with topical application of rebamipide ophthalmic suspension. Case presentation: A 73 -year-old woman had a history of type 2 diabetes for 35 years and nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy for 23 years. She presented to our department with discharge and ophthalmalgia in the left eye. A corneal ulcer was detected, and culture of corneal scrapings was performed, with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus canis being isolated. The infection was treated with levofloxacin eye drops and ofloxacin ophthalmic ointment based on the sensitivity profile of the isolate. However, a corneal epithelial defect persisted for approximately 2 months despite continuing treatment with 0. 1 % hyaluronic acid ophthalmic suspension and 0. 3 % ofloxacin eye ointment. Her hemoglobin A 1 c was 7. 3 %. The <b>persistent</b> <b>corneal</b> epithelial defect showed improvement at 2 weeks after treatment with rebamipide unit dose 2 % ophthalmic suspension, and it did not recur even when vitrectomy was subsequently performed for vitreous hemorrhage due to progression of diabetic retinopathy. Conclusion: This is the first report about efficacy of rebamipide unit dose 2 % ophthalmic suspension for presenting <b>persistent</b> <b>corneal</b> epithelial defect in a patient with diabetes. In the present case, the suggested mechanisms are the following: improving the corneal barrier function, stabilization of mucin on the keratoconjunctival epithelium, and improving the wettability and stability of the tear film, which resulted in the promotion of healing of the corneal epithelial defect in a short time period.

40|$|AIM—To {{investigate}} {{the hypothesis that}} <b>persistent</b> <b>corneal</b> and scleral inflammation following acanthamoeba keratitis is not always caused by active amoebic infection but can be due to persisting acanthamoebic antigens METHODS— 24 lamellar corneal biopsy and penetrating keratoplasty specimens were obtained from 14  consecutive patients at various stages of their disease and divided for microscopy and culture. Histological sections were immunostained and screened {{for the presence of}} Acanthamoeba cysts by light microscopy. Cultures were carried out using partly homogenised tissues on non-nutrient agar seeded with E coli. Clinical data were obtained retrospectively from the case notes of these patients.  RESULTS—Of the 24  specimens, 20  were obtained from eyes that were clinically inflamed at the time of surgery. Acanthamoeba cysts were present in 16  (80 %) of these 20  specimens, while only five (25 %) were culture positive. Acanthamoeba cysts were found to persist for up to 31  months after antiamoebic treatment.  CONCLUSION—These findings support the hypothesis that Acanthamoeba cysts can remain in corneal tissue {{for an extended period of}} time following acanthamoeba keratitis and may cause <b>persistent</b> <b>corneal</b> and scleral inflammation in the absence of active amoebic infection. In view of these findings, prolonged intensive antiamoebic therapy may be inappropriate when the inflammation is due to retained antigen rather than to viable organisms...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a rare, chronic {{allergic}} disease affecting {{children in}} prepuberal age. The hallmark of VKC {{is the presence}} of conjunctival upper tarsal and/or limbal papillary reaction. Recurrences of inflammation are characterized by intense ocular symptoms of itching, redness and photophobia associated with <b>corneal</b> <b>involvement</b> ranging from punctuate keratitis to corneal shield ulcers with risk of visual impairment. Areas covered: The goals of VKC treatment are to control inflammation, improve quality of life and avoid corneal complications. Topical antiallergic drugs are effective in mild to moderate forms of VKC, while, in the presence of intense symptoms and <b>corneal</b> <b>involvement,</b> short-term, high dose topical steroids are effective in controlling ocular inflammation. However, steroid chronic use leads to severe side effects such as glaucoma and cataract. Topical Cyclosporine A and Tacrolimus showed to be effective as steroid sparing agents, however, they are not yet available in the market for the use in VKC. Expert opinion: Current treatment of VKC is a severity-based approach, however evidence based guidelines are lacking. Novel molecule, targeting pathogenic mechanisms alternative to immune reaction, may improve the management and outcome if this challenging disease...|$|R
40|$|AIMS—To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) in <b>persistent</b> <b>corneal</b> epithelial defect with or without stromal thinning and corneal perforation.  METHODS— 28 patients (28  eyes) with <b>persistent</b> <b>corneal</b> epithelial defect unresponsive to medical treatment were given preserved human amniotic membrane transplants. The patients were divided into three groups: group A, <b>persistent</b> <b>corneal</b> epithelial defect 10  eyes; group B, epithelial defect with stromal thinning 13  eyes; and group C, corneal perforation five eyes. AMT was performed using one layer in group A and multilayers in group B and C.  The causes of persistent epithelial defect were neurotrophic keratopathy (24  eyes), limbal deficiency (six eyes), exposure keratopathy (four eyes), and Mooren's ulcer (one eye).  RESULTS—Success was noted in 82. 1 % (23 / 28 eyes) in all groups, with 80 % (8 / 10 eyes), 84. 6 % (11 / 13 eyes), and 80 % (4 / 5 eyes) in groups A, B, and C respectively, with a mean follow up of 10. 9  months (1 - 30 months). The mean epithelialisation time after AMT was 2. 1  weeks. The healing times of groups B and C are also significantly shorter than group A (p= 0. 017 and 0. 018, respectively). Corneal stromal thickness was significantly increased in all cases in groups B and C (p= 0. 006). Those with corneal perforation in group C were completely healed by multilayer AMT. There {{was no difference in}} the epithelialisation time between successful cases treated by a single operation (17  eyes) or repeated operation (six eyes). Vision improved in 18. 9 % (8 / 28 eyes) and worsened as a result of cataract formation in 2. 3 % (1 / 28 eyes). Failure was noted in 17. 9 % (5 / 28 eyes), because of corneal infection (two eyes), neurotrophic keratopathy with and without limbal deficiency (two eyes), and intractable corneal perforation (one eye). No patient developed major immediate postoperative complications or graft rejection.  CONCLUSION—Amniotic membrane can successfully treat refractory corneal epithelial defect by promoting epithelial healing and thus prevent corneal perforation. It {{can be used as a}} treatment for corneal perforation by restoring corneal stromal thickness so that emergency penetrating keratoplasty can be avoided. ...|$|R

Using crosses between MRL/lpr and C 3 H/HeJ-lpr/lpr (C 3 H/lpr) mice, at least the expression of IL- 1 β was found to be under the control of the MRL genetic background, likely with a recessive mode of inheritance. Considering that IL- 1 β in cornea was detected particularly in the epithelial layer, the high expression of IL- 1 β in cornea is most likely involved in the genetic predisposition for <b>corneal</b> <b>involvement</b> and possibly also for arthritis in an MRL strain of mice...|$|R
