5000|$|In Europe, from Roman times, {{the term}} [...] "vellum" [...] {{was used for}} the best quality of {{prepared}} skin, regardless of the animal from which the hide was obtained, calf, sheep, and goat all being commonly used (other animals, including pig, deer, donkey, horse, or camel have been used). Although the term derives from the French for [...] "calf", animal vellum can include hide from virtually any other mammal. The best quality, [...] "uterine vellum", was said to be made from the skins of stillborn or unborn animals, although the term was also applied to fine quality skins made from young animals. There has long been, however, much blurring of the boundaries between these terms. In 1519, William Horman could write in his Vulgaria: [...] "That stouffe that we wrytte upon, and is made of beestis skynnes, is somtyme called <b>parchement,</b> somtyme velem, somtyme abortyve, somtyme membraan." [...] Writing in 1936, Lee Ustick explained that: To-day the distinction, among collectors of manuscripts, is that vellum is a highly refined form of skin, parchment a cruder form, usually thick, harsh, less highly polished than vellum, but with no distinction between skin of calf, or sheep, or of goat.|$|E

40|$|Libraries and {{archives}} are {{keepers of}} expressions of human thought, {{from the most}} ancient documents written on papyrus, <b>parchement,</b> etc., to the new photographic and electronic supports. These materials of vegetal, animal or synthetic origin are subject to deterioration by physical agents (light, heat, humidity), chemical agents (atmospheric pollution), and biological agents (bacteria, microfungi and insects). Micro-organisms, agents of biodeterioration, as it is known, can be carried by airborne particles which can eventually settle in the dust. This papers shows {{the results of a}} preliminary quantitative and qualitative study made on potentially deteriogenic airborne fungal spores present in the dust deposited on shelves and documents of an archive's repository. The hygrothermometric parameters and the water content of the materials were also measured. The dust samples were collected with Swab Millipore samplers, using electrostatic attraction. This kind of sampler, originally destined for the microbiological analysis of water and, in extension, used to isolate bacteria from the book-material, was successfully also used in this case of dust sampling. Compared with the data resulting from the bibliography on dust, the use of Swabs allowed the spores present in the dust on books and shelves to be isolated...|$|E

Dvolist i prvih devet ostrižaka odlomci su hrvatskoglagoljskoga rukopisnog brevijara iz petnaestoga stoljeća iz dijela proprium sanctorum. Na prvom je foliju dvolista nastavak službe uz navečerje rođenja Blažene djevice Marije (07. rujna), a na početku druge folije kraj službe na dan svetoga Mateja evanđelista (21. rujna). U B stupcu drugog lista počinje služba u čast svetomu Mauriciju i družini (22. rujna). Ostrišci 1 - 9 nalazili su se između listova dvolista u službi unutar osmine rođenja Blažene djevice Marije. Svih devet ostrižaka dio su istoga lista, a sadržajno su dijelovi Pjesme nad pjesmama. Na temelju podataka o jeziku i pismu autor zaključuje da je brevijar čiji su to ostaci pisan u okolici Zadra. Na to upućuje izgled i način oblikovanja slova, miješani (ikavsko-ekavski) refleksi jata, južnočakavski oblik slze, jedan primjer cakavizama i činjenica da je pisaru prefiks vi- arhaizam. Fragmenti potvrđuju postojanje još jednoga rukopisnoga hrvatskoglagoljskoga brevijara, a važni su i zbog izričite jezične pravilnosti koja svjedoči o pisarevu eksplicitnom jezičnom školovanju. Nije bilo moguće jednoznačno utvrditi što piše na ostrišku 10. Ostrišci 11 - 14 dio su istoga folija pegamene i dio istog teksta, posljednice koja se čita na Duhove. Pisani su (polu) kurzivnom glagoljicom sjevernodalmatinske škole 17. ili 18. stoljeća. Tekst nije sasvim pisan istim pismom, već na ta četiri mala ostriška možemo govoriti o najmanje dvije vrste pisma. Newly {{discovered}} Pašman breviary fragments In {{the paper}} the author describes a double leaf and fourteen smaller parchment fragments taken {{out from the}} book covers and {{from the pages of}} Karaman 2 ̆ 7 s printed glagolitic missal of 1741, which belongs to the Pašman parsonage. The double leaf as well as the first nine fragments are pieces of the Croato-Glagolitic manuscript breviary of the 15 th century from the part proprium sanctorum. The first folio of the double leaf contains a continuation of the office {{on the eve of the}} Nativity of the Virgin Mary (7 th September), while the begining of the second folio contains the end of the office on the day of Saint Mathew the evangelist (21 st September). In the B column of the second folio begins the office in the honour of Saint Maurice and his company (22 nd September). The fragments 1 - 9 were placed between the two folios of the double leaf in office within the octave of the Navity of the Holy Virgin Mary. All nine fragments are a part of the same folio and their content is a part of The Song of Songs. On the basis of the data on the language and script, the author concludes that the breviary to which these fragments belonged was written in the vicinity of Zadar. This is implied by the form and ductus of lettres, mixed (ikavian and ekavian) refelxes of jat, the south čakavian form slze, an example of cakavism as well as the fact that the prefix vi- was an archaism for the scribe. The fragments confirm the existence of another manuscript Croato-glagolitic breviary. They are important because of the language regularity which bears witness on the scribe 2 ̆ 7 s explicit language education. It was impossible to determine unambiguously what was written on fragment 10. The fragments 11 - 14 are parts of the same <b>parchement</b> folio and of the same text which was read on Whitesunday. They are written in (semi) cursive glagolitic script of the north Dalmatian school of the 17 th or 18 th centuries. The text is not all written in the same script. On these four small fragments we can see at least two different scripts...|$|E
