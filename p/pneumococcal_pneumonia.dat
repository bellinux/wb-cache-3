Clinical guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend that linezolid be reserved for cases in which MRSA has been confirmed as the causative organism, or when MRSA infection is suspected based on the clinical presentation. The guidelines of the British Thoracic Society do not recommend it as first-line treatment, but rather as an alternative to vancomycin.

2500|$|John Cade {{was born}} in Murtoa, in the Wimmera region of Victoria, Australia. [...] John's father David was Murtoa's general practitioner. [...] Ellen, John's mother, and younger {{brothers}} David and Frank completed the family. [...] When John was a small boy, his father left for World War I and served in Gallipoli and France. [...] On return from the war, his father suffered from 'war-weariness' and had difficulty in continuing in general practice. [...] Therefore, his father sold the practice and accepted a position with the Mental Hygiene Department. [...] Over the next 25 years, Dr Cade Sr became medical superintendent at several Victorian mental hospitals, namely Sunbury, Beechworth and Mont Park. [...] John and his brothers spent many of their younger years living within the grounds of these institutions, which had a great bearing on John's later deep understanding {{of the needs of}} the mentally ill. [...] John was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne, matriculating in 1928. [...] He then studied medicine at the University of Melbourne, graduating at the age of 21 years with honours in all subjects. [...] He became a House Officer at St Vincent's Hospital and then Royal Children's Hospital before becoming severely ill with bilateral <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> [...] While he was convalescing, John fell in love with one of his nurses, Jean.

The programmed cell death could be reduced by caspase 6 inhibitor, pan-caspase inhibitor, calpain inhibitor, chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like proteases. Furthermore we could find an increased cleavage of Bid and reduced levels of Bcl 2 and Bax.

40|$|BACKGROUND Pneumococcal {{polysaccharide}} conjugate vaccines prevent pneumococcal {{disease in}} infants, but their efficacy against <b>pneumococcal</b> community-acquired <b>pneumonia</b> in adults 65 {{years of age}} or older is unknown. METHODS In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 84, 496 adults 65 {{years of age or}} older, we evaluated the efficacy of 13 -valent polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (PCV 13) in preventing first episodes of vaccine-type strains of <b>pneumococcal</b> community-acquired <b>pneumonia,</b> nonbacteremic and noninvasive <b>pneumococcal</b> community-acquired <b>pneumonia,</b> and invasive <b>pneumococcal</b> disease. Standard laboratory methods and a serotype-specific urinary antigen detection assay were used to identify community-acquired <b>pneumonia</b> and invasive <b>pneumococcal</b> disease. RESULTS In the per-protocol analysis of first episodes of infections due to vaccine-type strains, community-acquired pneumonia occurred in 49 persons in the PCV 13 group and 90 persons in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 45. 6 %; 95. 2 % confidence interval [CI], 21. 8 to 62. 5), nonbacteremic and noninvasive community-acquired pneumonia occurred in 33 persons in the PCV 13 group and 60 persons in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 45. 0 %; 95. 2 % CI, 14. 2 to 65. 3), and invasive pneumococcal disease occurred in 7 persons in the PCV 13 group and 28 persons in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 75. 0 %; 95 % CI, 41. 4 to 90. 8). Efficacy persisted throughout the trial (mean follow-up, 3. 97 years). In the modified intention-totreat analysis, similar efficacy was observed (vaccine efficacy, 37. 7 %, 41. 1 %, and 75. 8 %, respectively), and community-acquired pneumonia occurred in 747 persons in the PCV 13 group and 787 persons in placebo group (vaccine efficacy, 5. 1 %; 95 % CI, - 5. 1 to 14. 2). Numbers of serious adverse events and deaths were similar in the two groups, but there were more local reactions in the PCV 13 group. CONCLUSIONS Among older adults, PCV 13 was effective in preventing vaccine-type pneumococcal, bacteremic, and nonbacteremic community-acquired pneumonia and vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease but not in preventing community-acquired pneumonia from any cause...|$|R
