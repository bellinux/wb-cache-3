25|$|Shortly after <b>passing</b> <b>Point</b> Judith, Rhode Island, Kennedy's plane headed {{directly}} towards Martha's Vineyard. Instead {{of following}} the coastline of Rhode Island Sound and Buzzards Bay, {{which would have}} provided visible lights on the ground, Kennedy chose the shorter, direct path over a 30-mile (50km) open stretch of water. According to the FAA Airplane Flying Handbook, crossing large bodies of water at night may be very hazardous, {{not only from the}} standpoint of ditching in the water, but also because the featureless horizon visually blends with the water, in which case depth perception and orientation become difficult.|$|E

This loop is also used by local services calling at Newbury Racecourse during race days. Special chartered trains hauled by steam locomotives often use the loop to take on water because it has good road access although the Down platform in Newbury station can also be used for this purpose. All trains that pass through the loop must continue through the loop for the Down platform to rejoin the mainline.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} an ortho-rectification {{method of}} airborne SAR images which is multi-photo combined adjustment method based on F. Leberl imaging model. Multi-photo combined adjustment model of airborne SAR images is built. Multi-photo combined adjustment conditions {{are given in}} this paper. This method is applicable to multi-temporal, multi-side-looking-orientation, multiflight-height, multi-resolution SAR Images. Two adjustment experiments have been done with one-meter resolution airborne SAR images in Chengdu study site. In the two experiments, the GCPs and the <b>Pass</b> <b>Points</b> are distributed rationally in each image. The two experimental {{results show that the}} coordinate accuracy of <b>Pass</b> <b>Points</b> is feasible for 1 : 10 000 scale ortho-image making and topographic map updating. There are four images in the first experiment, and nine GCPs and ten <b>Pass</b> <b>Points</b> are used. There are eleven images in the second experiment, and nine GCPs and thirty <b>Pass</b> <b>Points</b> are used. The second experimental result is better than the first one. Because the <b>Pass</b> <b>Points</b> are twice overlap in the first experiment and the most <b>Pass</b> <b>Points</b> are more than twice overlap in the second one. 1.

500|$|Ellen Southard had {{rounded the}} {{northern}} tip of Wales, <b>passing</b> <b>Point</b> Lynas at 1pm {{on the day}} of the storm. After receiving the pilot on board, she was taken in tow by the steamtug United Kingdom under the command of Captain Griffiths for the final leg of her journey into the port of Liverpool. By 9pm, conditions had become very stormy, and her sails were taken down; by the time she reached Formby, the ship could no longer be steered, and the tow line was also lost. Ellen Southard dropped her anchors, but they did not hold in the ever-strengthening storm. [...] Finding that it was unable to offer further assistance, the tug set off for Liverpool with the purpose of returning with a lifeboat, but was soon grounded, thereby leaving the stricken American ship to fend for herself. By midnight when the storm reached its peak, Ellen Southard was dismasted and grounded on Jordan Flats about a mile from Crosby lighthouse. [...] The waves crashed heavily on her, and she started to break up as she thumped on the sandbank. The crew were unable to signal for assistance until first light as the vessel did not carry any signal flares — in the interim, they lashed themselves to what remained of the ship to prevent being swept away by the heavy sea.|$|E

6000|$|In fact, {{it was the}} {{beginning}} of that terrible storm of June, 1870. All in a moment, out of the hot sunshine of the day it burst upon us before we quite knew that it threatened, even before we had fairly noticed the clouds, and it went on from passion to passion with an inexhaustible violence. In the square upon which our friends looked out of their dining-room windows the trees whitened in the gusts, and darkened in the driving floods of the rainfall, and in some paroxysms of the tempest bent themselves in desperate submission, and then with a great shudder rent away whole branches and flung them far off upon the ground. Hail mingled with the rain, and now the few umbrellas that had braved the storm vanished, and the hurtling ice crackled upon the pavement, where the lightning played like flames burning from the earth, while the thunder roared overhead without ceasing. There was something splendidly theatrical about it all; and when a street-car, laden to the last inch of its capacity, came by, with horses that pranced and leaped under the stinging blows of the hailstones, our friends felt as if it were an effective and very naturalistic bit of pantomime contrived for their admiration. Yet as to themselves they were very sensible of a potent reality in the affair, and at intervals during the storm they debated about going at all that day, and decided to go and not to go, according to the changing complexion of the elements. Basil had said that as this was their first journey together in America, he wished to give it at {{the beginning}} as pungent a national character as possible, and that as he could imagine nothing more peculiarly American than a voyage to New York by a Fall River boat, they ought to take that route thither. So much upholstery, so much music, such variety cf company, he understood, could not be got in any other way, and it might be that they would even catch a glimpse of the inventor of the combination, who represented the very excess and extremity of a certain kind of Americanism. Isabel had eagerly consented; but these aesthetic motives were paralyzed for her by the thought of <b>passing</b> <b>Point</b> Judith in a storm, and she descended from her high intents first to the Inside Boats, without the magnificence and the orchestra, and then to the idea of going by land in a sleeping-car. Having comfortably accomplished this feat, she treated Basil's consent as a matter of course, not because she did not regard him, but because as a woman she could not conceive of the steps to her conclusion as unknown to him, and always treated her own decisions as the product of their common reasoning. But her husband held out for the boat, and insisted that if the storm fell before seven o'clock, they could reach it at Newport by the last express; and it was this obstinacy that, in proof of Isabel's wisdom, obliged them to wait two hours in the station before going by the land route. The storm abated at five o'clock, and though the rain continued, it seemed well by a quarter of seven to set out for the Old Colony Depot, in sight of which a sudden and vivid flash of lightning caused Isabel to seize her husband's arm, and to implore him, [...] "O don't go by the boat!" [...] On this, Basil had the incredible weakness to yield; and bade the driver take them to the Worcester Depot. It was the first swerving from the ideal in their wedding journey, but it was by no means the last; though it must be confessed that it was early to begin.|$|E
