5|$|Agamemnons first {{target service}} took place before her {{modifications}} were completed. On 19 March 1921, she {{was exposed to}} a cloud of <b>poisonous</b> <b>gas</b> {{to determine the effect}} of gas on a battleship. It was found that gas could penetrate the ship via her various openings, but the ship had not been sealed against gas before the trial and no accurate results applicable to a commissioned battleship could be obtained. On 21 September, she was subjected to machine-gun fire by strafing aircraft. These trials showed that such strafing could harass a battleship, but could not impair her fighting or steaming capabilities, and helped to determine protection for bridge personnel.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Cardiff {{with his wife}} in 1958, working as a store man in the building department of Cardiff Corporation. His wife of nearly 50 years, Muriel died in 1967 after a gas leak outside their home went undetected and filled the house with <b>poisonous</b> <b>gas,</b> leaving Keenor hospitalised after being discovered by a neighbour. Keenor died in a residential nursing home on 19 October 1972 and his ashes were buried in Thornhill crematorium in Cardiff. His son Graham, who had joined Cardiff City as a youth player but never appeared for the first-team, served as club secretary between 1959, following the resignation of Trevor Morris, and 1972, resigning from the post just days after his fathers death.|$|E
50|$|Health {{of people}} is also {{severely}} affected. According to the report from the WHO, Khrew has a more death rate than any other town in the district due to these <b>poisonous</b> <b>gases.</b> These factories emit 100,000 kilograms of toxic fumes, <b>poisonous</b> <b>gases</b> and life-threatening elements in the air on daily basis. Lung disease is the main killer, second Kidney Failure and third Heart Diseases, these <b>poisonous</b> <b>gases</b> were declared responsible according to the report. The report also suggested that pollution control must intervene and check these factories on monthly basis whether the pollution control devices are functioning properly.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Donna {{returns home}} to warn her mother, Sylvia (Jacqueline King), and {{grandfather}} Wilfred Mott (Bernard Cribbins) about the Doctor, having been advised {{to do so}} by Martha. Concerned about the implications of telling the truth, Donna decides against warning her mother. The Doctor investigates the ATMOS device attached to Donna's car and discovers a secondary function: the device can emit a <b>poisonous</b> <b>gas.</b> Wilfred attempts to take the car off the road, but is trapped when Staal activates all 400 million ATMOS devices installed in cars worldwide. The episode's cliffhanger depicts Donna shouting for help while the Doctor stares helplessly at a street full of cars emitting the gas, while on their ship orbiting the planet, the Sontarans prepare themselves for battle.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen cyanide is a <b>poisonous</b> <b>gas</b> that {{interferes with}} {{cellular}} respiration. Cyanide prevents the cell from producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by binding {{to one of}} the proteins involved in the electron transport chain. This protein, cytochrome c oxidase, contains several subunits and has ligands containing iron groups. The cyanide component of Zyklon B can bind at one of these iron groups, heme a3, forming a more stabilized compound through metal-to-ligand pi bonding. As a result of the formation of this new iron-cyanide complex, the electrons that would situate themselves on the heme a3 group can no longer do so. Instead, these electrons destabilize the compound; thus, the heme group no longer accept them. Consequently, electron transport is halted, and cells can no longer produce the energy needed to synthesize ATP. In a human weighing , death occurs within two minutes of inhaling 70mg of hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterward, {{another woman}} is found murdered at Coney Island {{in a similar}} manner; Stuckey finds a soda can with a bloody {{fingerprint}} on it, later confirmed to be Harrison's. The police learn Harrison disclosed his hiding place to a friend on a conspiracy theorist website; Munch recognizes the friend as his ex-wife Gwen (Carol Kane), whom he convinces to reveal Harrison's location. After Harrison evades capture, Stabler and Benson ask for help from Zimmer, who said she has been taking care of Harrison since he lost his parents as a child. An unstable Harrison visits Zimmer, who calls Stabler and Benson to arrest him. As {{they are about to}} return to the precinct, Zimmer gets locked into her car and a <b>poisonous</b> <b>gas</b> is released into the air; Stabler breaks her car window, but is unable to save her in time.|$|E
50|$|Detergent-related suicide {{involves}} mixing {{household chemicals}} to produce hydrogen sulfide or other <b>poisonous</b> <b>gases.</b> The suicide rates by domestic gas fell from 1960 to 1980.|$|R
50|$|Veber volunteered {{into service}} in World War I at {{fifty years of}} age. He was {{intoxicated}} by <b>poisonous</b> <b>gases</b> and demobilized {{in the course of}} 1918.|$|R
50|$|Due to faulty smoke dampers {{within the}} {{ventilation}} duct network, the toxic fumes circulated throughout the hotel's air circulation system, accelerating {{the spread of}} the <b>poisonous</b> <b>gases.</b>|$|R
5|$|The game {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of weapons, including melee, projectile, and explosive weapons, as well as airstrike-based attacks. Some are based on real-life arms, such as the shotgun, bazooka, and hand grenade; others are rather fanciful and cartoonish, such as the sheep, which serves as a mobile explosive, and the skunk, which releases <b>poisonous</b> <b>gas.</b> In a normal match, all teams begin with the same weapons, based on the chosen weapon set. Some weapons may not become available until a certain number of turns pass. Depending on the game options, additional weapons may randomly fall onto the terrain in airdropped and teleported crates. In addition to normal weapons, during team creation, each team chooses a special weapon which becomes available to them after a certain number of turns. The special weapons are more powerful than regular weapons and often offer special abilities; super weapons will rarely fall in weapon crates. These weapons are often based on cartoonish themes, such as the French Sheep Strike, and usually devastating in power. In homage to the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, one of the game weapons is a Holy Hand Grenade, with a sound-effect reminiscent of the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's Messiah.|$|E
25|$|Tabun can be {{destroyed}} with bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite), though the <b>poisonous</b> <b>gas</b> cyanogen chloride is produced.|$|E
25|$|When a BSC is {{serviced}} or relocated, including {{replacement of}} HEPA filters, {{it must be}} gas decontaminated. Gas decontamination involves filling the BSC with a <b>poisonous</b> <b>gas,</b> most commonly formaldehyde gas.|$|E

'Registration Day' was on 29 September; every inhabitant received a Registration Card with a unique number.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of sulfur}} monoxide's rare {{occurrence}} in our atmosphere and poor stability; {{it is difficult}} to fully determine its hazards. But when condensed and compacted, it forms disulfur dioxide, which is relatively toxic and corrosive. This compound is also highly flammable (similar flammability to methane) and when burned produces sulfur dioxide, a <b>poisonous</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 26 March 1896, Brunner {{coal mine}} disaster, 65 miners {{killed by an}} {{explosion}} or by <b>poisonous</b> <b>gases</b> following the explosion. As of 2017 this is New Zealand's largest death toll from an industrial accident.|$|R

25|$|A {{partisan}} movement, with {{a strength}} of 300, {{was active in}} the Odessa catacombs all throughout the occupation. It managed to organize an excellent communication with the partisan headquarters in Moscow. Antonescu was advised to use <b>poisonous</b> <b>gas</b> to clear the catacombs, but afraid of the public implications of such an act decided to abstain from it. Eventually, Romanians were able to inflict a high number of casualties on the partisans with the help of some partisans who switched sides and revealed the movement through the catacombs. Yet, the catacombs were never completely cleared, and the partisans maintained a continuous resistance movement until the return of the Red Army.|$|E

25|$|In January 2009, {{researchers}} {{claimed they}} had found evidence that the Persian Empire used poisonous gases at Dura against the Roman defenders during the siege. Excavations at Dura have discovered the remains of 19 Roman and 1 Persian soldiers {{at the base of}} the city walls. An archaeologist at the University of Leicester suggested that bitumen and sulphur crystals were ignited to create <b>poisonous</b> <b>gas,</b> which was then funnelled through the tunnel with the use of underground chimneys and bellows. The Roman soldiers had been constructing a countermine, and Sassanian forces are believed to have released the gas when their mine was breached by the Roman countermine. The lone Persian soldier discovered among the bodies is believed to be the individual responsible for releasing the gas before the fumes overcame him as well.|$|E
