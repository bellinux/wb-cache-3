5|$|As can be {{seen from}} the diagram, the unusual shape of the Paragon made it very {{complicated}} to build. Engineering and factory translated the design into one executable on the shop floor.

5|$|Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) Colin Cantwell {{created the}} concept model that {{established}} the TIE fighter's ball-cockpit and hexagonal panels design for Star Wars (1977). Star Wars creator George Lucas liked the basic design {{consisting of two}} panels connected by a stick with a ball-shaped cockpit, but Cantwell's concept had few details.

5|$|The temple takes {{advantage}} of Singapore's abundant sunlight by having three different kinds of solar energy cells on its rooftop. They are the poly-crystalline silicon solar array, mono-crystalline silicon solar array and amorphous silicon solar array.

The carvings on the panels were {{provided}} by Allen and Rita Orre of Ohio and the International Amusement Devices Company of Ohio; the mirrors were produced by an Indianapolis glass firm. The scenery panels were initially some discovered Dentzel company <b>panels,</b> <b>and</b> these were used in 1976 and 1977 while replica Mangels-Illions-style panels were built in the museum's shops.|$|E

5|$|Architecturally, the {{elements}} {{characteristic of the}} style include: the ogival, redented towers shaped like lotus buds; half-galleries to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are devatas (or apsaras), bas-reliefs, and on pediments extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work. Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including gilded stucco on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling <b>panels</b> <b>and</b> doors.|$|E
5|$|As the {{visibility}} of LGBT comic book creators and characters has increased, comic book fandom has taken notice. Panels discussing LGBT topics occur regularly at comic book and LGBT conventions such as Comicon and Gaylaxicon, and conventions also feature stands dedicated to LGBT comics. Ted Abenheim, event chair of Prism Comics said in 2008, “We’re in our sixth year of exhibiting at Comic-Con, presenting a larger booth and more <b>panels</b> <b>and</b> events than ever before.” A number of websites dedicated to LGBT comic book fandom and featuring content from staff writers exist, such as Prismcomics.org, Pinkkrytonite.com and Gayleague.com.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th {{century the}} reach and {{influence}} of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries' merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy. The early to mid-century saw great rises in international trade and domestic wealth, leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art. Artists from the area attracted patronage from the Baltic coast, the north German and Polish regions, the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland. At first, masters had acted as their own dealers, attending fairs where they could also buy frames, <b>panels</b> <b>and</b> pigments. The mid-century saw the development of art dealership as a profession; the activity became purely commercially driven, dominated by the mercantile class.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, a 777-style interior, {{known as}} the Boeing Signature Interior, debuted on the 767-400ER. Subsequently adopted for all new-build 767s, the Signature Interior {{features}} even larger overhead bins, indirect lighting, and sculpted, curved panels. The 767-400ER also received larger windows derived from the 777. Older 767s can be retrofitted with the Signature Interior. Some operators have adopted a simpler modification {{known as the}} Enhanced Interior, featuring curved ceiling <b>panels</b> <b>and</b> indirect lighting with minimal modification of cabin architecture, as well as aftermarket modifications such as the NuLook 767 package by Heath Tecna.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s {{samples of}} extremophile molds {{were taken from}} Mir. Ninety species of {{micro-organisms}} were found in 1990, {{four years after the}} station's launch. By the time of its decommission in 2001, the number of known different micro-organisms had grown to 140. As space stations get older, the problems with contamination get worse. Moulds that develop aboard space stations can produce acids that degrade metal, glass and rubber. The moulds in Mir were found growing behind <b>panels</b> <b>and</b> inside air-conditioning equipment. The moulds also caused bad smell, which was often cited as visitors' strongest impressions.|$|E
