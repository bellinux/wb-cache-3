40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{examines the}} political business cycle at <b>public</b> <b>procurements,</b> which were submitted by 13 regional {{authorities in the}} Czech Republic from September 2004 till June 2010. Two hypotheses are tested here. According the first one, the incumbents try to increase the probability of re-election by visible investments, e. g. <b>public</b> <b>procurements</b> for buildings. The second hypothesis supposes that the incumbents are afraid of not being re-elected. Therefore they strive for maximizing their personal profit from the office. Regression analysis is used for testing. <b>Public</b> <b>procurements</b> for buildings are tested separately from <b>public</b> <b>procurements</b> for goods and services. The number of <b>public</b> <b>procurements,</b> total amount and {{the average number of}} bidders are tested for each group of <b>public</b> <b>procurements.</b> The result is a detection of different motives in different parts of political business cycle...|$|R

The examined data cover a period from the year 2005 to 2011. Two hypotheses have been set in order to discover whether there is such a relation. The first one postulates that the <b>public</b> <b>procurements</b> are used on constructions, well visible investments, so as to increase the probability of being re-elected. The second hypothesis marks the effort of politicians to maximize their own benefits till the end of electoral term as the main reason for contracting <b>public</b> <b>procurements.</b> The hypotheses are proved separately for constructions and for supplies and services by the number of <b>public</b> <b>procurements,</b> the total amount of money spent on <b>public</b> <b>procurements</b> in a particular term, by average amount of bids and by the relate of the end and assumed price.

40|$|Environmental {{awareness}} among {{public authorities}} and governmental institutions {{has been a}} priority initiative for countries in the EU over the last years. The public sector is a major consumer of products and services, while their environmental policies are also at a top. Many EU Member Countries have already implemented EU legislation for greener purchasing in the public sector, while others are now preparing their National Action Plan. However, conscious acceptance of National Policy objectives and adoption of green environmental behavior in all scales {{of the public sector}} is a challenge. Researchers are concerned that public authorities and especially those of a small size are still focused on the lowest price as a leading factor in public tenders. Many studies have shown that lack of knowledge is a key determinant for the scarce environmental requirements in <b>public</b> <b>procurements.</b> Under this framework, this thesis explores the determinants that affect the implementation of environmental requirements in <b>public</b> <b>procurements</b> and consequently the environmental awareness of small sized public organizations.
