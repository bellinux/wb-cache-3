50|$|Hazards can be {{classified}} as different types in several ways. One of these ways is by specifying {{the origin of the}} hazard. One key concept in identifying a hazard is the presence of stored energy that, when released, can cause damage. Stored energy can occur in many forms: chemical, mechanical, thermal, radioactive, electrical, etc. Another class of hazard does not involve release of stored energy, rather it involves the presence of hazardous situations. Examples include confined or limited egress spaces, oxygen-depleted atmospheres, awkward positions, repetitive motions, low-hanging or <b>protruding</b> <b>objects,</b> etc.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigation {{examines the}} thermal behaviour of single and arrays of fluid jets impinging at heated surfaces, and formulates enhancement schemes for the jet impingement heat transfer processes for high-intensity cooling applications. The proposed techniques are numerically modelled and analysed {{over a wide}} parametric range to identify flow characteristics leading to thermal enhancement and optimum performance. The first scheme applies to a single fluid jet and incorporates a <b>protruding</b> <b>object</b> at the impingement surface to improve heat transfer. In this, a conical protrusion of high thermal conductivity {{is attached to the}} heated surface directly beneath the jet. Three different aspect ratios of 0. 5, 1 and 2 are investigated for the protrusion while the inclusion of a fillet {{at the base of the}} cone is also studied. Jet Reynolds numbers between 100 and 30, 000 are modelled. The observed thermal performance is compared with a reference case having no surface attachment. With this arrangement, the heat transfer rate typically varies between 10 and 40 percent above the reference case although depending on certain parametric combinations, the heat transfer may increase above or decrease below the reference performance. The highest indicated increase in heat transfer is about 90 percent while 15 percent below is the lowest. Careful selection of cone surface profile creates potential for further thermal enhancement. The second scheme applies to a single fluid jet and incorporates a recess in the impingement surface to improve heat transfer. In this, a cylindrical cavity is introduced to the surface beneath the jet into which the fluid jet impinges. The effects of the cavity on heat transfer are examined for a number of different cavity diameters, cavity depths and jet discharge heights wherein a surface without a cavity is taken as the reference surface. Cavity diameters of 2, 3 and 4 times the jet diameter are investigated at cavity depths between zero and 4 times the jet diameter. Jet discharge heights range between 2 jet diameters above the reference surface to 2 jet diameters below the reference surface. The jet Reynolds number is varied between 100 and 30, 000. With this enhancement technique, increases in heat transfer rates of up to 45 percent are observed when compared to the reference performance. The thermal performance of fluid jet arrays is examined by altering square or hexagonal array configurations to identify flow characteristics leading to optimal heat transfer rates. For this, the jet to jet spacing is varied between 1. 5 and 7 times the jet diameter while the jet to surface height is varied between 2 and 6 times the jet diameter. Jet Reynolds numbers between 100 and 30, 000 are investigated. For each configuration, a critical jet-to-jet spacing is identified below which the heat transfer is observed to reduce significantly. Correlations for the expected heat transfer for a square or hexagonal array are presented in terms of the jet to jet spacing, jet height and jet Reynolds number...|$|E

50|$|In aviation, {{induced drag}} {{tends to be}} greater at lower speeds because a high angle of attack is {{required}} to maintain lift, creating more drag. However, as speed increases the angle of attack can be reduced and the induced drag decreases. Parasitic drag, however, increases because the fluid is flowing more quickly around <b>protruding</b> <b>objects</b> increasing friction or drag. At even higher speeds (transonic), wave drag enters the picture. Each of these forms of drag changes {{in proportion to the}} others based on speed. The combined overall drag curve therefore shows a minimum at some airspeed - an aircraft flying at this speed will be at or close to its optimal efficiency. Pilots will use this speed to maximize endurance (minimum fuel consumption), or maximize gliding range {{in the event of an}} engine failure.|$|R

40|$|Clean {{and tidy}} sites {{have often been}} {{associated}} with positive safety cultures in construction. Poor housekeeping can result {{in the creation of}} additional hazards and dangers in the form of <b>protruding</b> <b>objects</b> which may also be sharp, and increase in situations that can lead to slips, trips and falls on sites. They also create uneven ground levels, debris, and muddy conditions, which can all lead to an increase in accidents. Housekeeping also contributes to projects being finished in a timely manner due to the fewer distractions created by the chaos. However, maintaining good housekeeping practices on site have been known to be challenging due to the rapid and complex nature of construction projects. In a research that was initiated to explore the question of ‘why is housekeeping a continuing challenge in Lesotho construction?’, the final outcome of site visits and observations revealed the classic phenomenon of the Hawthorne effect. Without deliberate or intentional 'interventionary' measures or demand for regulatory adherence, subsequent visits revealed a transformation in site practices specifically on housekeeping. The Hawthorne effect refers to the alteration of behaviour by the subjects of a study due to their awareness of being observed. This effect does not necessarily refer to positive or negative outcome. In this paper, the transformation that occurred with regard to the workers’ practices is discussed critically {{in the context of this}} phenomenon. A key outcome of this discussion is whether housekeeping can be encouraged or improved using the notion of being observed. Finally, the ethical stance of carrying out overt or covert observations is deliberated...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} {{polarization}} reversal in backscatter over flooded land regions, and demonstrate {{for the first}} time the utility of spaceborne Ku-band scatterometer for large-scale flood mapping. Scatterometer data were collected over the globe by the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) operated at 14 GHz on the Japanese ADEOS spacecraft from September 1996 to June 1997. During this time span, several severe floods occurred. Over most land surface, vertical polarization backscatter (Sigma(sub upsilon(upsilon)) is larger than horizontal polarization backscatter (sigma(sub hh)). Such polarization characteristics is reversed and sigma(sub upsilon(upsilon)) is smaller than sigma(sub hh) over flooded regions, except under a dense forest canopy. The total backscatter from the flooded landscape consists of direct backscatter and boundary-interaction backscatter. The direct term is contributed by direct backscattering from <b>objects</b> <b>protruding</b> above the water surface, and by backscattering from waves on the water surface. The boundary-interaction term is contributed by the forward scattering from the <b>protruding</b> <b>objects</b> and then reflected from the water surface, and also by the forward scattering from these objects after the water-surface reflection. Over flooded regions, the boundary-interaction term is dominant at large incidence angles and the strong water-surface reflection is much larger for horizontal polarization than the vertical one due to the Brewster effect in transverse-magnetic waves. These scattering mechanisms cause the polarization reversal over flooded regions. An example obtained with the Analytic Wave Theory is used to illustrate the scattering mechanisms leading to the polarization reversal. We then demonstrate the utility of spaceborne Ku-band scatterometer for large-scale flood mapping. We process NSCAT data to obtain the polarization ratio sigma(sub hh) /sigma(sub upsilon(upsilon)) with colocated data at incidence angles larger than 40 deg. The results over Asian summer monsoon regions in September-October 1996 indicate flooded areas in many countries such as Bangladesh, India, Lao, Vietnam, Cambodia, and China. Reports documented by the United Nation Department of Humanitarian Affairs (now called UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) show loss of many lives and severe flood related damages which affected many million people in the corresponding flooded areas. We also map the NSCAT polarization ratio over the same regions in the "dry season" in January 1997 as a reference to confirm our results. Furthermore, we obtain concurrent ocean wind fields also derived from NSCAT data, and Asia topographic data (USGS GTOPO 30) to investigate the flooded area. The results show that winds during summer monsoon season blowing inland, which perplex flood problems. Overlaying the topographic map over NSCAT results reveals an excellent correspondence between the confinement of flooded area within the relevant topographic features, which very well illustrates the value of topographic wetness index. Finally, we discuss the applications of future spaceborne scatterometers, including QuikSCAT and Seawinds, for flood mapping over the globe...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedAristotle famously {{said that}} vision is “to {{know what is}} where, by looking”—but {{that is not the}} whole story. Vision is also to know what is where {{relative}} to everything else. We constantly make use of relative position information, when we draw, build, or read a map or diagram. How does our visual system divide up space, to let us know that one object is above another, or that one part of an <b>object</b> <b>protrudes</b> from the end of another part? Structural description theories of shape recognition hold that our visual system represents objects as collections of parts in particular relations.; The principal focus of this dissertation is to investigate one plausible scheme for the encoding of within-object (between-part) spatial relations: the encoding of medial-axis-relative relations. Medial axes are imaginary lines that pass through the central part of a volume, as a spit through a hot dog. Medial axes within each part of an object can define an invariant, stick-figure like structure of an object, {{in the sense that the}} points of attachment and relative angles between the axes (in rigid objects) will not change with the perspective from which the object is seen. A behavioral similarity rating experiment showed that naïve subjects spontaneously judge novel objects to be more similar if the objects share the same medial axis structure, in many cases even if the objects are composed of different-shaped parts and shown from different perspectives. When subjects were asked to distinguish (in a same/different task) categorically-different medial axis structures seen from different perspectives, they showed slower recognition times with greater differences in perspective (though the estimated rates of mental rotation were very fast).; Finally, evidence from a multi-voxel pattern classification fMRI study showed that medial axis structure—as distinct from simple retinotopic orientation—is encoded starting at a very early stage (V 3) in the visual cortex. Patterns of activity in V 3 were more similar in response to novel objects that shared the same medial axis structure than in response to novel objects that shared the same overall orientation...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This thesis {{deals with}} a system that reduces the {{oncoming}} boundary layer displacement thickness in a wind tunnel. The device is then {{used to examine the}} effect that this boundary layer has on the aerodynamic drag of a standard truck, which is classified as a bluff body with a high ground clearance and the same truck fitted with skirts all round, which is then classified as a bluff body with a low ground clearance. To gain insight into this field of industrial aerodynamics, an extensive literature survey was done in which all the relevant SAE papers onwards from the late sixties were studied and summarised in the first section of this report. The second section {{deals with a}} system that can limit the boundary layer displacement thickness in the test section of the 3 / 4 open jet wind tunnel. Through investigations and an extensive literature research a suction device was designed and built. This boundary layer removal system was then tested to ensure that the main flow indicators are not influenced by the suction and thus lie within internationally accepted limits. Included in this section are a description of the truck model and the other instruments or devices used to complete the testing. The third section deals with the aerodynamic drag experienced by the bluff body with a high ground clearance. Included in the third section is an investigation that deals with the aerodynamic drag of the same truck model, when skirting has been added which considerably lowers the ground clearance. The results obtained from the above investigations indicate that the drag of the Ground Simulation model without skirts is increased by about 3. 8 % with the removal of the boundary layer and up to 10 % for the model with the skirts. It is thus shown that the farther the <b>object</b> <b>protrudes</b> into the boundary layer, the larger the increase in drag will be once this boundary layer has been removed.
