40|$|In {{the paper}} {{differentiation}} of gas pipeline infrastructure {{development in the}} Polish voivodships was presented. To illustrate this diversity the method of cluster analysis is used, obtained {{on the basis of}} statistical data collected by the Central Statistical Office (CSO). In order to conduct a <b>preliminary</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedure</b> for classification of individual provinces in relation to the assessment of the development of gas pipeline infrastructure linear classification was used, involved determining synthetic measure, which is the average of the variable components, through which voivodships were ordered. In order to estimate the distance between the clusters the variance analysis was used with the implementation of the Ward method. The analysis was performed {{on the basis of the}} following indicators: average increase in length of the gas network (an average for the total voivodoship 164. 2 km), growth of the gas network in comparison to the first year of observation (123 %), number of gas connections per 1 km of gas pipe (18. 87 no∙km- 1), the length of the network per unit area (5. 37 m∙ha- 1), intensity of network loading (84. 15 m 3 ∙d- 1 ∙km- 1), inhabitants having access to the gas system in % of total population (51. 33 %). In the analysis five clusters were grouped. Critical value was determined and segregation of individual clusters was made, taking into account the dominant parameters...|$|E
40|$|The auditors' <b>preliminary</b> {{analytical}} <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> (PARPs) {{have recently}} received increased {{attention in the}} accounting literature, because of the growing realization that PARPs may significantly enhance audit effectiveness and efficiency. Although both judgmental and statistical PARPs (JARPs and SARPs respectively) are recognized in the professional literature, earlier research has concentrated exclusively on statistical ARPs (SARPs). This research bias is inappropriate, given that SARPs merely supplement, but do not replace, auditor-judgments in PARPs. Enhancement of audit effectiveness and efficiency requires, therefore, evidence bearing on several aspects of auditors' PARPs judgments. This dissertation uses a model based on Signal Detection Theory to provide evidence relating to the following aspects of auditors' PARPs judgments: (a) judgmental accuracy, (b) decision errors, (c) implicit loss functions, and (d) information required to facilitate PARPs judgments. The major findings of the study were: (1) auditors can make reasonably accurate AR judgments {{on the basis of}} limited information available at the onset of an audit; (2) their responses were affected by judgmental biases, with a propensity to flag for intensive audit account book values which are fairly presented; (3) the auditors' judgments were miscalibrated, being mostly overconfident; and (4) simple ARPs such as ratio analysis, scanning, and comparisons amongst data, are those preferred by auditors for their PARPs judgments. This study's findings suggest the need to identify the causes, and subsequently mitigate the effects, of judgment biases before the potential of auditors' AR judgments at enhancing audit effectiveness and efficiency can be fully realized...|$|R
