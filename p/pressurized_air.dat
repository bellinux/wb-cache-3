5|$|A {{pipe organ}} {{contains}} {{one or more}} sets of pipes, a wind system, and one or more keyboards. The pipes produce sound when <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> produced by the wind system passes through them. An action connects the keyboards to the pipes. Stops allow the organist to control which ranks of pipes sound at a given time. The organist operates the stops and the keyboards from the console.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipe organ}} is a musical {{instrument}} that produces sound by driving <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> (called wind) through organ pipes selected via a keyboard. Because each pipe produces a single pitch, the pipes are provided in sets called ranks, {{each of which has}} a common timbre and volume throughout the keyboard compass. Most organs have multiple ranks of pipes of differing timbre, pitch, and volume that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use of controls called stops.|$|E
5|$|Increasingly, {{ski resorts}} are relying on snowmaking, the {{production}} of snow by forcing water and <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> through a snow gun on ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at ski resorts. This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases. Wet bulb temperature {{is used as a}} metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account. Snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption, thereby limiting its use.|$|E
5000|$|Pneumatic air guns use {{internally}} stored {{compressed air}} {{as the source}} of energy to propel the projectile. Single-stroke and multi-stroke guns utilize an on-board pump to <b>pressurize</b> <b>air</b> in an internal reservoir, while pre-charged pneumatic guns' reservoirs are filled using either a high-pressure hand pump or by decanting air from a diving cylinder.|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} supercharger is {{a specific}} type of supercharger that uses an electrically powered forced-air system that contains an electric motor to <b>pressurize</b> the intake <b>air.</b> By <b>pressurizing</b> the <b>air</b> available to the engine intake system, the air becomes more dense, and is matched with more fuel, producing the increased horsepower to the wheels.|$|R
50|$|Airsoft {{guns are}} replica weapons used in airsoft sports. They are {{essentially}} a special type of low-power smoothbore air guns designed to <b>pressurize</b> <b>air</b> within an internal chamber to shoot non-metallic spherical projectiles (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} BBs) typically made of (but not limited to) plastic or biodegradable resin materials. Airsoft guns and pellets have significantly less penetrative and stopping powers than conventional air guns, and are generally safe for competitive sporting and recreational purposes if proper protective gear is worn.|$|R
5|$|On August 12, 1985, Japan Airlines Flight 123, a Boeing 747-146SR, {{suffered}} a rupture {{of the pressure}} bulkhead in its tail section, caused by undetected damage during a faulty repair to the rear bulkhead after a tailstrike seven years earlier. <b>Pressurized</b> <b>air</b> subsequently rushed out of the bulkhead and blew off the plane's vertical stabilizer, also severing all four of its hydraulic control systems. The pilots were {{able to keep the}} plane airborne for 32 minutes using differential engine power, but without any hydraulics or the stabilizing force of the vertical stabilizer, the plane eventually crashed in mountainous terrain. There were only 4 survivors among the 524 on board. This accident is the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history.|$|E

50|$|Pressurized {{kerosene}} lamps have a {{gas generator}} and gas mantle; these {{are known as}} Petromax, Tilley lamps, or Coleman lamps, among other manufacturers. They produce more light per unit of fuel than wick-type lamps, but are more complex and expensive in construction, and more complex to operate. A hand-pump <b>pressurizes</b> <b>air,</b> which forces liquid fuel from a reservoir into a gas generator. Vapor from the gas generator burns, heating a mantle to incandescence and also providing heat to the gas generator.|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} sliding-ring and pressure-balancing seal {{capable of}} transferring <b>pressurize</b> <b>air</b> from stationary to rotating parts {{was developed and}} experimentally investigated at sliding velocities and cooling-air pressures up to 10, 000 feet per minute and 38. 3 {{pounds per square inch}} absolute, respectively. Leakage of cooling air was completely eliminated with an expenditure of balance air less than one-fourth the leakage loss of air from labyrinth seals under the same conditions. Additional cooling of the carbon-base seal rings was required, and the maximum wear rate on the rings was about 0. 0005 inch per hour...|$|R

25|$|The Glock 17T {{training}} pistol fires {{paint or}} rubber bullets. The two versions are easily recognizable from their bright blue frames: the Glock 17T 9mm FX, which fires Simunition FX cartridges and the Glock 17T 7.8×21 AC, which fires cartridges with paint and rubber bullets powered by replaceable <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> cartridges.|$|E
25|$|As in a {{traditional}} pipe organ, a theatre organ uses <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> to produce musical tones. Unification and extension give the theatre organ its unique flexibility. A rank is extended by adding pipes {{above and below the}} original pitch, allowing the organist to play that rank at various pitches by selecting separate stop tabs.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol fuel: Some alcohols, mainly ethanol and methanol, {{can be used}} as fuel. Fuel {{performance}} can be increased in forced induction internal combustion engines by injecting alcohol into the air intake after the turbocharger or supercharger has pressurized the air. This cools the <b>pressurized</b> <b>air,</b> providing a denser air charge, which allows for more fuel, and therefore more power.|$|E

40|$|The {{interest}} in biomass technology {{has got a}} lot of attention due to the increase in fuel prices and issues like global warming. Producer gas as a alternative fuel, produced from biomass gasification process can be used to generate power and electricity. However, in air blown gasification, the producer gas produced has Low Calorific Value (LCV) about 4 - 6 MJ Nm - 3 with CO 2 content around 10 - 20 % by volume. To increase the LCV, the used of calcium oxide, CaO as sorbent to absorb CO 2 in the producer gas can make biomass technology more viable. In the present study, the aim is to study the fluidization of the bed in terms of the bed expansion and the pressure drop of the 1000 μm CaO-sand mixtures at different percentages, the air volume flow rate and <b>pressurize</b> <b>air</b> intake in the cold model experiment. The behaviors of 1000 μm CaO-sand mixtures have been conducted in a Small Bubbling Fluidized Bed (SBFB). The results show that the decrease of the CaO percentages from 70, 60, 50 to 40, will increase the pressure drop (ΔP) in the SBFB under constant pressure of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 bars. The bed expansion height also increased under all air pressures except at the low superficial flow velocity less than 0. 06 m sec - 1 at 2, 3, 4, 5 bars (70, 60 % CaO mixture), when the air volume flow rate increased (in term of superficial flow velocities 0. 020 to 0. 215 m sec - 1). The conclusion has been determined where the CaO percentages of 50 and 40 were found to have a good fluidization in the range of 15 - 55 L min - 1 for all <b>pressurize</b> <b>air</b> compressors supply (2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 bars) when tested in a SBFB...|$|R
25|$|Because of heat {{generated}} at Mach 2 cruise, {{not only the}} crew compartment, but the wheel wells and electronics bay were <b>pressurized</b> and <b>air</b> conditioned. The B-58 utilized {{one of the first}} extensive applications of aluminum honeycomb panels, which bonded outer and inner aluminum skins to a honeycomb of aluminum or fiberglass.|$|R
25|$|ESCs {{provide all}} of the {{features}} and functions expected of a typical splice closure in an enclosure that prevents the intrusion of liquid and vapor into the closure interior. This is accomplished {{through the use of}} an environmental sealing system such as rubber gaskets or hot-melt adhesives. Some ESCs use <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> to help keep moisture out of the closure.|$|E
25|$|In this situation, {{the surge}} {{can raise the}} {{pressure}} of the air to a level that can cause damage. This is because if the pressure rises high enough, a compressor stall occurs—stored <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> decompresses backward across the impeller and out the inlet. The reverse flow back across the turbocharger makes the turbine shaft reduce in speed more quickly than it would naturally, possibly damaging the turbocharger.|$|E
25|$|Instead of bow {{thrusters}} {{the ships}} {{are equipped with}} Wärtsilä Air Bubbling System (WABS). <b>Pressurized</b> <b>air</b> released from nozzles located below the waterline lubricates the hull and, by reducing friction between steel and ice, improves the ship's ability to operate in difficult ice conditions such as pressure ridges and {{reduces the risk of}} becoming stuck in ice. The system {{can also be used to}} steer the ship at low speeds.|$|E

These turbines are easy to bring up to the surface for maintenance because they are <b>pressurized</b> with <b>air.</b> They are also equipped with sensors to detect any water trying to make its way into the pressurized generator.|$|R
40|$|The {{on-going}} {{development of}} a compact centrifugal compressor as a first stage or pre-compressor for cold climate operation of heat pumps is described. Positioned in the low pressure vapor portion of the refrigerant loop, this compressor will, on cold days, operate automatically to boost refrigerant pressure, {{in a manner similar}} to the way an automotive supercharger <b>pressurizes</b> <b>air.</b> The single stage motor driven centrifugal compressor runs on oil-free bearings. It is being configured to work in concert with a traditional heat pump compressor. The goal of this work is to enable air source heat pumps to efficiently extract heat from even the coldest ambient air without backup heat and without changing refrigerant type or the basic design of the positive displacement style compressors widely used in today’s heat pumps. Doing so will allow air source heat pumps to operate effectively in virtually all major population centers. To date, a first article supercharger has been designed and built, and its performance mapped. Work to integrate it with a commercially available positive displacement (PD) heat pump compressor is underway...|$|R
25|$|The gas used {{should have}} a low heat capacity, so that a given amount of {{transferred}} heat leads to a large increase in pressure. Considering this issue, helium {{would be the best}} gas because of its very low heat capacity. Air is a viable working fluid, but the oxygen in a highly <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> engine can cause fatal accidents caused by lubricating oil explosions. Following one such accident Philips pioneered the use of other gases to avoid such risk of explosions.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> {{comes from}} an air {{compressor}} in the locomotive and is sent from car to car by a train line made up of pipes beneath each car and hoses between cars. The principal problem with the straight air braking system is that any separation between hoses and pipes causes loss of air pressure and hence {{the loss of the}} force applying the brakes. This could easily cause a runaway train. Straight air brakes are still used on locomotives, although as a dual circuit system, usually with each bogie (truck) having its own circuit.|$|E
25|$|Interconnection of {{multiple}} generator sources into an electrical grid required development of circuit breakers with increasing voltage ratings and increased ability to safely interrupt the increasing short-circuit currents produced by networks. Simple air-break manual switches produced hazardous arcs when interrupting high voltages; these {{gave way to}} oil-enclosed contacts, and various forms using directed flow of <b>pressurized</b> <b>air,</b> or of pressurized oil, to cool and interrupt the arc. By 1935, the specially constructed circuit breakers used at the Boulder Dam project use eight series breaks and pressurized oil flow to interrupt faults of up to 2,500 MVA, in three cycles of the AC power frequency.|$|E
50|$|Originally made popular by the Super Soaker 50, {{pressurized}} reservoir {{systems are}} still common for small water guns. A water gun using {{this system is}} <b>pressurized</b> by <b>air</b> being pumped and compressed into its reservoir. When the trigger is pulled, a valve is opened and the compressed air pushes {{the water out of}} the nozzle. Super Soaker started with two pressurized reservoir water guns, and has continued to produce them in various shapes and sizes.|$|R

The interior cavity of the asteroid / habitat / station consists of a human-constructed, self-contained ecosystem, complete with <b>pressurized,</b> breathable <b>air,</b> land and soil, bodies of water, and clouds rotating around a periodic source of artificial sunlight.|$|R
25|$|The first Chicken, no. 33, was {{met with}} dissatisfaction by the employees. They were built without air brakes, which meant that the {{conductor}} would have to traverse a full tram to reach the emergency brake should the motorman fall unconscious. The railway authorities sided with the employees, requiring the company to rebuild the unit. A similar concern was raised concerning the trailers. As air brakes are fail safe, the trailers would automatically brake should the trailer become disconnected. With the need for <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> system in place, the advantages of pneumatic door were reaped. However, the pneumatics systems largely ate up the costs savings of rebuilding material. Most of the work was carried out at Sagene Depot, and was carried out between mid-1954 to 1958.|$|E
25|$|The M-34 {{was used}} in an unusual system, first tried by Imperial Germany in 1918 with a Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI, that used an {{external}} supercharger to supply <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> to the aircraft's M-34FRN engines. The first installation, designated ATsN-1 (Agregat tsentral'novo nadduva – central boosting unit), used an auxiliary M-34 fitted inside the fuselage to drive a central supercharger with ducts leading to the engines in the wings. This was flight-tested in a Tupolev TB-3 in 1935. It was adapted {{for use in a}} Petlyakov Pe-8 bomber prototype with a smaller Klimov M-100 engine substituted for the M-34 as the ATsN-2. It was flight-tested during 1938–39, but was not approved for production. The same idea was revived in 1943 by Nazi Germany with the Henschel Hs 130E bomber prototype series, with the Höhen-Zentrale Anlage unit.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{providing}} {{pressure from the}} center out like with a bladder press, the membrane of a membrane press is mounted {{on one side of}} the press horizontally between the two ends. On the opposite ends are drain screens that allow the release juice to drain through into the waiting press pan. Like a bladder press external pressure is applied by <b>pressurized</b> <b>air</b> (rarely water) that gradually inflates the membrane that gently presses the grapes against the drain screen. The advantage of this style of press is the gentle pressure and minimal movement of the grapes, which minimizes the amount of tearing and scouring of the skins and seeds. This limits the amount of suspended solids and extracted phenolics in the pressed wine. Also, many membrane presses are fully enclosed, allowing for anaerobic winemaking without any exposure to oxygen. In addition to the same labor and time disadvantages (some presses can take 2 to 4 hours a batch) of the other batch presses is that these computerized and enclosed membrane press are often some of the more expensive pieces of equipment a winery can buy.|$|E
5000|$|Air piston was a {{short-lived}} variation of air pressure {{that was made}} in 2005 under the Aqua Master Pre-Charger lineup. [...] A tube with a piston in it was <b>pressurized</b> with <b>air</b> in the back, pushing the piston to the front. Then the gun was switched to water mode, and water would be pumped in the front, pushing the piston to the back again. This system gave the guns extra pressure, and allowed them to shoot any direction.|$|R
50|$|An {{inflatable}} {{building is}} a structure constructed using two layers of membrane connected together, typically using spars made from the same material. The cavity formed between the layers is <b>pressurized</b> with <b>air</b> producing a rigid structural element which allows large span structures to be achieved. The key difference between air-supported buildings and inflatable buildings is that air-supported buildings require airlocks at all the access points to prevent air being lost when doors are opened since the entire occupied space of the building is pressurized.|$|R
