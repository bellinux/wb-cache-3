5|$|In the 8th century AD {{the city}} had {{important}} relationships with Maya cities to the southwest, especially in the Petexbatún region, and on the Pasión and Usumacinta rivers, including Seibal (on the Pasión), Altar de Sacrificios (near where the Pasión becomes the Usumacinta), and Dos Pilas, Aguateca, Tamarindito, Arroyo de Piedra and Cueva de Sangre (all five in the Petexbatún region). It {{is possible that the}} widespread distribution of Ik-style ceramics in elite tombs at sites in the Petexbatún region may be linked to the military defeat of Motul de San José by Dos Pilas, with these high quality ceramics forming a part of the tribute <b>payment</b> <b>made</b> to the Petexbatún kingdom. After its defeat {{at the hands of the}} Petexbatún kingdom, Motul de San José no longer erected sculpted stelae but the history of the site continued to be recorded to a certain extent in texts on Ik-style ceramics.|$|E
5|$|Although they {{recorded}} {{all income}} {{that came through}} the Exchequer, not all sources of income went through that office, so the Pipe rolls are not a complete record of royal income. They did include both regular income from the royal lands and judicial profits, {{as well as more}} occasional income derived from feudal levies, wardships, and ecclesiastical vacancies. Another source of income recorded in the rolls was from feudal reliefs, the <b>payment</b> <b>made</b> by an heir when inheriting an estate. A major source of income in the roll of 1130 is from the forests, under the Forest Law, which was the royal law covering the restrictions imposed on non-royals hunting in areas of the country declared royal forest. However, royal income from taxation that was not annually assessed was not usually recorded in the Pipe rolls, nor were his receipts from lands outside England. Some payments went directly to the king's household, and because they did not pass through the Exchequer, they were not recorded in the Pipe rolls.|$|E
5|$|Yakut Khan {{landed at}} Sewri on 14 February 1689, and razed the Mazagon Fort in June 1690. After a <b>payment</b> <b>made</b> by the British to Aurangzeb, {{the ruler of}} the Mughal Empire, Yakut {{evacuated}} Bombay on 8 June 1690. The arrival of many Indian and British merchants {{led to the development}} of Bombay's trade by the end of the seventeenth century. Soon it was trading in salt, rice, ivory, cloth, lead and sword blades with many Indian ports as well as with the Arabian cities of Mecca and Basra. By 1710, the construction of Bombay Castle was finished, which fortified the islands from sea attacks by European pirates and the Marathas. By 26 December 1715, Charles Boone assumed the Governorship of Bombay. He implemented Aungier's plans for the fortification of the island, and had walls built from Dongri in the north to Mendham's point in the south. He established the Marine force, and constructed the St. Thomas Cathedral in 1718, which was the first Anglican Church in Bombay. In 1728, a Mayor's court was established in Bombay and the first reclamation was started which was a temporary work in Mahalaxmi, on the creek separating Bombay from Worli. The shipbuilding industry started in Bombay in 1735 and soon the Naval Dockyard was established in the same year.|$|E

The relevant legal provisions of the European Union are analysed as well. The thesis is divided into three chapters. The first chapter deals with consumer protection {{in the area of}} online <b>payments</b> <b>made</b> by debit cards. This chapter focuses on the liability for any unauthorized <b>payment</b> transactions <b>made</b> by debit cards and the cases of no consumer's liability, limited consumer's liability and unlimited consumer's liability are discussed there. It is also concerned with the issues of authorization of <b>payment</b> transactions <b>made</b> by debit cards, the limitations on the use of debit cards, specific obligations of both the consumer and the payment provider concerning the use of debit cards, the burden of proof and notification of unauthorized <b>payment</b> transactions <b>made</b> by debit cards. Finally, the legal frameworks of countries mentioned above dealing with consumer protection in the area of online <b>payments</b> <b>made</b> by debit cards are compared. The second chapter deals with the same topics as the first chapter, however, it is from the perspective of consumer protection in the area of online <b>payments</b> <b>made</b> by credit cards [...] . ...|$|R

25|$|Some economists such as Scott Sumner and Edmund Phelps {{advocate}} a wage subsidy program. A wage subsidy is a <b>payment</b> <b>made</b> {{by a government}} for work people do.

On April 2, 1754, the court increased the payment to 20 pounds. This, too, was delayed, and Edwards wrote to expedite the payment, and it was finally made, which mostly quelled the potential uprising, but left some harsh feelings.|$|E

25|$|A {{dividend}} is a <b>payment</b> <b>made</b> by {{a corporation}} to its shareholders, usually as a distribution of profits. When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, the corporation {{is able to}} re-invest the profit in the business (called retained earnings) and pay a proportion of the profit as a dividend to shareholders. Distribution to shareholders may be in cash (usually a deposit into a bank account) or, if the corporation has a dividend reinvestment plan, the amount can be paid by the issue of further shares or share repurchase.|$|E
25|$|Macri {{wanted to}} {{negotiate}} with the holdouts and end the default to return to the international capital markets and strengthen the national economy. Argentina offered to pay $6.5billion to settle lawsuits on 5 February 2016, requesting that the prior ruling on its payments be lifted. The deal would still need to be ratified by the Argentine Congress. Although Cambiemos did not have a majority in either house of Congress, the bill was approved in March and Argentina faced a court hearing in New York on 13 April. The court upheld judge Thomas P. Griesa's ruling, allowing Argentina to pay the 2005 and 2010 bondholders to whom it was still in default. The <b>payment</b> (<b>made</b> with a bond sale) was reportedly the end of the Argentine default, which began in 2001.|$|E
25|$|In April 1874, Robert E. and Mary Lee's eldest son, George Washington Custis Lee, petitioned Congress {{for payment}} for the Arlington estate. Lee argued that tax sale of the entire {{property}} (rather than just that portion needed to pay the tax debt) amounted to confiscation and was unconstitutional. He also argued that the tax collectors' refusal to accept <b>payment</b> <b>made</b> the proceedings null and void. Finally, he asserted {{that the federal government}} should only be able to secure a life interest in the property (in other words, seize it only as long as Mary Lee lived) and could not assert title to the estate without the consent of the state of Virginia. He offered not to litigate the seizure of Arlington if paid. Lee's petition was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary on April 6, but it was not acted on.|$|E

25|$|In Australia the {{employment}} relationship involves {{a degree of}} trust and confidence, particularly for a corporate employer that can only act through its employees. An employer may summarily dismiss an employee who destroys that trust and confidence. An employer may seek to entice or motivate its employees in the expectation of receiving a bonus payment or promises of fair treatment. Statute, regulation and industrial awards may provide the “means by which employees may be protected from abuses of power by the employer, and provides means of redress to employees who are aggrieved by some conduct of the employer” In some instances however the availability of redress may be less certain, for example a bonus <b>payment</b> <b>made</b> {{be left to the}} discretion of the employer, or the promises of fair treatment may be contained solely in policies of the employer. The employee trusts that the employer will deliver on that expectation or promise. The question arising in Mr Barker's case was whether the expectation or promise in the Bank's policies were legally enforceable.|$|E

500|$|The {{curriculum}} {{during the}} 17th and 18th centuries {{is not known}} for certain. In 1714 the trustees agreed that the pupils should attend church services at St Denys' Church six days a week; whether this was adhered to is not clear. Religious practice was a stipulation in the 1835 decree, which required pupils to pray at the start and end of each day and engage in daily readings of holy scriptures. However, the emphasis was always on classical education, which likely required instruction in Latin from the earliest times; in 1835, learning the classics was enshrined as the school's primary purpose. In the mid-19th century, Carre's offered this classical education for free, but arithmetic, geometry and algebra were taught as extras {{at a rate of}} two guineas per term. Students were enrolled from the age of eight, and were expected to be able to read, write, recite the Lord's Prayer, the Apostles' Creed and the Ten Commandments, and [...] "be qualified to begin Latin grammar". Students had to supply their own equipment, except pens and ink, which were covered by a 10 shilling <b>payment</b> <b>made</b> each term to the school. The school's inspection in 1865 mentions geography and history teaching, although the general standard of attainment was low.|$|E

500|$|When the Milken {{study was}} published, HUD had already {{commissioned}} its own study of seller-funded down-payment assistance programs. [...] It {{was performed by}} the Concentrance Consulting Group and published in March 2005 (herein, the [...] "Concentrance study"). [...] Unlike the earlier OIG reports, the Concentrance study was based largely on a cross-sectional analysis of data collected in interviews with individual homebuyers, sellers and various types of real-estate professionals in ten metropolitan areas. [...] Their findings corroborated some of the claims made by the nonprofit organizations, particularly that the typical recipient {{was a person who}} would not otherwise have been able to become a home owner. [...] But the interviewees also generally corroborated some of the claims made by detractors of the programs—that sellers were routinely raising their sales prices to recoup the <b>payment</b> <b>made</b> to the nonprofit organization, and that the price increases led to higher loan costs for the buyers along with a higher risk of default on their loans. [...] The study was not restricted to the Nehemiah Program; no particular program was singled out {{in the body of the}} report.

[...] These results indicated that the Nehemiah Program was the most active program in the ten metropolitan areas covered by the study.|$|E
