5000|$|Secretin was {{the first}} hormone to be identified. In 1902, William Bayliss and Ernest Starling were {{studying}} how the nervous system controls the process of digestion. It was known that the <b>pancreas</b> <b>secreted</b> digestive juices {{in response to the}} passage of food (chyme) through the pyloric sphincter into the duodenum. They discovered (by cutting all the nerves to the pancreas in their experimental animals) that this process was not, in fact, governed by the nervous system. They determined that a substance secreted by the intestinal lining stimulates the pancreas after being transported via the bloodstream. They named this intestinal secretion secretin. Secretin {{was the first}} such [...] "chemical messenger" [...] identified. This type of substance is now called a hormone, a term coined by Bayliss in 1905.|$|R
50|$|A working <b>pancreas</b> {{continually}} <b>secretes</b> {{small amounts}} of insulin into the blood to maintain normal glucose levels, which would otherwise rise from glucose release by the liver, especially during the early morning dawn phenomenon. This insulin {{is referred to as}} basal insulin secretion, and constitutes almost half the insulin produced by the normal pancreas.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> zymogens {{partly to}} prevent the enzymes from digesting {{proteins}} in the cells {{in which they are}} synthesised. Enzymes like pepsin are created in the form of pepsinogen, an inactive zymogen. Pepsinogen is activated when chief cells release it into the gastric acid, whose hydrochloric acid partially activates it. Another partially activated pepsinogen completes the activation by removing the peptide, turning the pepsinogen into pepsin. Accidental activation of zymogens can happen when the secretion duct in the pancreas is blocked by a gallstone resulting in acute pancreatitis.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} prevent {{inappropriate}} or premature activation of the digestive enzymes (they may, for example, trigger pancreatic self-digestion causing pancreatitis), these enzymes are secreted as inactive zymogen. The precursor of pepsin, pepsinogen, is secreted by the stomach, and is activated only in the acidic environment found in stomach. The <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> the precursors {{of a number of}} proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. The zymogen of trypsin is trypsinogen, which is activated by a very specific protease, enterokinase, secreted by the mucosa of the duodenum. The trypsin, once activated, can also cleave other trypsinogens as well as the precursors of other proteases such as chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase to activate them.|$|E
5000|$|While insulin is {{secreted}} by {{the pancreas}} to lower blood glucose levels, glucagon is secreted to raise blood glucose levels. This is why glucagon {{has been known}} for decades as a counter-regulatory hormone. [...] When blood glucose levels are low, the <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> glucagon, which in turn causes the liver to convert stored glycogen polymers into glucose monomers, which is then released into the blood. This process is called glycogenolysis. Liver cells, or hepatocytes, have glucagon receptors which allow for glucagon to attach to them and thus stimulate glycogenolysis. [...] Contrary to insulin, which is produced by pancreatic β-cells, glucagon is produced by pancreatic α-cells. It is also known that an increase in insulin suppresses glucagon secretion, and a decrease in insulin, along with low glucose levels, stimulates the secretion of glucagon.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{has several}} isoforms, {{including}} C16:0, which is found {{primarily in the}} secretory granules and toward {{the surface of the}} membrane of β cells. Secretory granules and β cells are found in the islet of Langerhans and in rat β TC3 cells. Research has shown that in the pancreases of type II diabetic mouse models, there is a deficiency of C16:0. Additional research has shown that C16:0 {{plays an important role in}} assisting to improve insulin crystal preservation, and as the β cells in the <b>pancreas</b> <b>secrete</b> insulin, sulfatide aids in the monomerization of insulin, which is the breakdown of insulin into its basics components or monomers. Consequently, sulfatide is needed in order to maintain normal insulin secretion, which sulfatide is capable of mediating through stimulation of calcium dependent exocytosis and Adenosine triphosphate(ATP) sensitive potassium ion channels. Sulfatide can also stimulate proinsulin folding as well, as it can serve as a molecular chaperone for insulin.|$|R
50|$|Pulsatile {{intravenous}} insulin therapy, {{sometimes called}} metabolic activation therapy, or cellular activation therapy describes in a literal sense the intravenous injection of insulin in pulses versus continuous infusions. Injection of insulin in pulses mimics the physiological secretions of insulin by the pancreas into the portal vein which then drains into the liver. In healthy, non-diabetic individuals, pancreatic secretions of insulin {{correspond to the}} intake of food. The <b>pancreas</b> will <b>secrete</b> variable amounts of insulin based upon {{the amount of food}} consumed (basically speaking, the more food that is consumed, the more insulin the <b>pancreas</b> will <b>secrete)</b> among other factors. Continuous exposure to insulin and glucagon is known to decrease the hormones’ metabolic effectiveness on glucose production in humans due to the body developing an increased tolerance to the hormones. Down-regulation at the cellular level may partially explain the decreased action of steady-state levels of insulin, while pulsatile hormone secretion may allow recovery of receptor affinity and numbers for insulin. Intermittent intravenous insulin administration with peaks of insulin concentrations may enhance suppression of gluconeogenesis and reduce hepatic glucose production.|$|R
50|$|Trypsin {{protease}} (enzyme that digests protein) {{and functions}} as a steapsin inhibitor. Trypsin is produced in the <b>pancreas</b> and <b>secreted</b> as trypsinogen, an inactive precursor of trypsin. The {{reason for this is}} to prevent trypsin from acting upon the pancreas. Upon entering the duodenum, enteropeptidase is secreted which activates trypsin. Since trypsin is classified as a protease, its function in the gastric tract is to act as a steapsin suppressor by digesting steapsin.|$|R
50|$|The Hay System {{promoted}} eating {{three meals}} per day with meal one being what the diet {{considers to be}} alkaline foods only, meal two composed of what the diet considers to be protein foods with salads, vegetables and fruit, and meal three composed of what the diet considers to be starchy foods with salads, vegetables and sweet fruit; with an interval of 4.0 to 4.5 hours between each meal. The Hay diet was popular in the 1930s and many restaurants offered 'Hay-friendly' menus; followers of his dietary advice, included Henry Ford and Man Ray. In this period Hay was criticized in the Journal of the American Medical Society (JAMA) as a food-faddist and separately for advocating that a patient with type 1 diabetes on the Hay diet should stop taking insulin. In 1935, Stewart Baxter showed that the <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> digestion enzymes simultaneously {{regardless of whether the}} food eaten is carbohydrates or protein, contrary to one of the central propositions of the diet.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> fluid rich in {{digestive}} enzymes and bicarbonate. The alkaline secretion {{is important in}} buffering of acid chyme entering duodenum and for activation of enzymes. This secretion is formed in pancreatic ducts, and studies to date show that plasma membranes of duct epithelium express H+/HCO 3 − transporters, which depend on gradients created by the Na+/K+-ATPase. However, the model cannot fully account for high-bicarbonate concentrations, and other active transporters, i. e. pumps, have not been explored. Here we show that pancreatic ducts express functional gastric and non-gastric H+-K+-ATPases. We measured intracellular pH and secretion in small ducts isolated from rat pancreas and showed their sensitivity to H+-K+ pump inhibitors and ion substitutions. Gastric and non-gastric H+-K+ pumps were demonstrated on RNA and protein levels, and pumps were localized to the plasma membranes of pancreatic ducts. Quantitative analysis of H+/HCO 3 − and fluid transport shows that the H+-K+ pumps can contribute to pancreatic secretion in several species. Our results call for revision of the bicarbonate transport physiology in pancreas, and most likely other epithelia. Furthermore, because pancreatic ducts {{play a central role}} in several pancreatic diseases, it is of high relevance to understand the role of H+-K+ pumps in pathophysiology...|$|E
50|$|Bayliss and Starling {{investigated}} pancreatic secretion, {{which at}} that time was believed to be entirely under nervous control.

40|$|Exogenous {{androgenic}} steroids {{applied to}} pregnant sheep programmes a PCOS-like phenotype in female offspring. Via ultrasound guidance we applied steroids directly to ovine fetuses at d 62 and d 82 of gestation, and examined fetal (day 90 gestation) and postnatal (11 months old) pancreatic structure and function. Of three classes of steroid agonists applied (androgen - Testosterone propionate (TP), estrogen - Diethystilbesterol (DES) and glucocorticoid - Dexamethasone (DEX)), only androgens (TP) caused altered pancreatic development. Beta cell numbers were significantly elevated in prenatally androgenised female fetuses (P= 0. 03) (to approximately the higher numbers found in male fetuses), whereas alpha cell counts were unaffected, precipitating decreased alpha:beta cell ratios {{in the developing}} fetal pancreas (P= 0. 001), sustained into adolescence (P= 0. 0004). In adolescence basal insulin secretion was significantly higher in female offspring from androgen-excess pregnancies (P= 0. 045), and an exaggerated, hyperinsulinaemic response to glucose challenge (P= 0. 0007) observed, whereas prenatal DES or DEX treatment had no effects upon insulin secretion. Postnatal insulin secretion correlated with beta cell numbers (P= 0. 03). We conclude that the pancreas is a primary locus of androgenic stimulation during development, giving rise to postnatal offspring whose <b>pancreas</b> <b>secreted</b> excess insulin due to excess beta cells {{in the presence of}} a normal number of alpha cells...|$|R
40|$|Pancreatic tumours are scirrhous, {{avascular}} tumours, {{suggesting that}} they may produce angiogenesis inhibitors that suppress {{the growth of the}} vasculature to the tumour and metastases. We have sought evidence for the angiogenesis inhibitor, endostatin, in normal and cancerous pancreatic tissue. Using Western blotting, we found mature 20 [*]kDa endostatin in cancer tissue but not in normal tissue. Several endostatin-related peptides of higher mol wt were present in both tissues. Extracts from normal tissue were able to degrade exogenous endostatin, whereas extracts from cancer were without effect. Although the exocrine <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> inactive proenzymes of trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase, their possible role in this degradation was examined. The trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor, Glycine max, did not prevent the degradation of endostatin by normal pancreatic extracts but elastatinal, a specific inhibitor of elastase, reduced the rate of degradation. Extracts of pancreatic tumours did not express any detectable elastase activity, but an elastase (Km 1. 1 [*]mM) was expressed by extracts of normal pancreas. We conclude that endostatin is present and stable in pancreatic cancer tissues, which may explain their avascular nature, but that normal pancreatic tissue expresses enzymes, including elastase, which rapidly degrade endostatin. The stability of endostatin may have implications for its therapeutic use...|$|E
40|$|On a {{clinical}} basis, severe insulin re-sistance {{is defined as}} a situation inwhich a patient requires 200 units of insulin daily for 2 days (1). This definitionwas determined 50 years ago, when it was erroneously believed that the human pancreas secreted 200 units of insulin a day. Although it is now known that the normal <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> only 20 – 40 units of insulin a day, this clinical definition is helpful because it delin-eates a very small group of patients, many with a number of unusual under-lying problems. In adults, the conditions associated with clinical insulin resistance are gross obesity, severe infection, Cushing’s syn-drome, acromegaly, hemochromatosis, li-podystrophic diabetes, genetic insulin receptor abnormalities, insulin receptor antibodies, Werner’s syndrome (adult form of progeria), insulin degradation at the injection site, and high titers of IgG insulin binding antibodies (immune me-diated). Gross obesity {{is by far the most}} common condition. Although a recent re-view (2) discussed the use of U- 500 reg-ular insulin in states of severe insulin resistance, no detailed description of how to start and adjust doses of this concen-trated form of insulin was given.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> high HCO 3 - has not been fully resolved. This alkaline secretion, formed in pancreatic ducts, {{can be achieved by}} transporting HCO 3 - from serosa to mucosa or by moving H+ in the opposite direction. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether H+/K+-ATPases are expressed and functional in human pancreatic ducts and whether proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have effect on those. Here we show that the gastric HKα 1 and HKβ subunits (ATP 4 A; ATP 4 B) and non-gastric HKα 2 subunits (ATP 12 A) of H+/K+-ATPases are expressed in human pancreatic cells. Pumps have similar localizations in duct cell monolayers (Capan- 1) and human pancreas, and notably the gastric pumps are localized on the luminal membranes. In Capan- 1 cells, PPIs inhibited recovery of intracellular pH from acidosis. Furthermore, in rats treated with PPIs, pancreatic secretion was inhibited but concentrations of major ions in secretion follow similar excretory curves in control and PPI treated animals. In addition to HCO 3 -, pancreas also secretes K+. In conclusion, this study calls for a revision of the basic model for HCO 3 - secretion. We propose that proton transport is driving secretion, and that in addition it may provide a protective pH buffer zone and K+ recirculation. Furthermore, it seems relevant to re-evaluate whether PPIs should be used in treatment therapies where pancreatic functions are already compromised...|$|E

Similar studies were made when ethanol was administered as an intravenous priming dose followed by a maintenance infusion.

40|$|ABSTRACT Micropuncture {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to examine electrolyte secretion by the in vitro rabbit pancreas. The concentration profiles of the major secreted ions and digestive protein and the electrical potential profile within the pancreatic ductal system have been determined during spontaneous and secretin-stimulated secretion. The active transport of both Na and HCO 3 are the rate-controlling steps in primary secretion. Spontaneous secretion is produced primarily within the intralobular ducts. The anion composition of this primary secretion depends on the secretion rate with HCO 3 ranging from about 70 meq/liter at low rates to about 110 meq/liter at high rates. With secretin stimulation the smaller extralobular ducts also secrete and this extralobular secretion has a higher HCO? content than that of the intralobular secretion. In the main collecting duct the anion composition of the juice is modified further by Cl-HC 03 exchange which appears to be a passive process depending on the average residence time of the juice in the main duct. Little is known definitively about the mechanisms responsible for pancreatic electrolyte secretion either at the whole tissue or the cellular level. The <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> a fluid rich in HCO 3 into a highly branched ductal system through which it is transported to the duodenum to aid in the neutralization of gastric secretion. Due to the complex geometry of the ductal system, electrolyte secretion has been studied primarily by collecting and analyzing the juice leaving the gland. The characteristic feature of the externally collected juice is a hyperbolic dependence of the juice HCO 3 concentration on the secretion rate (1). Over the years three major whole tissue mechanisms, admixture (2, 3), Cl-HCO 3 exchange (4), and unicellular (5 - 7) have been proposed to explain this dependency. These mechanisms differ only i...|$|E
40|$|Human {{pancreas}} is {{the largest}} digestive gland in the body. It has both endocrine and exocrine functions. <b>Pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> the hormones insulin and glucagon. Insulin keeps the body in euglycaemic state as the main function of insulin is metabolism of carbohydrate. Diabetes is a disease of altered carbohydrate metabolism. At present, pancreatic transplantation is the only definitive therapy that can establish a euglycaemic state. AIM AND OBJECTIVE Keeping the importance of pancreatic hormones in human, {{the present study was}} carried out where we compared the pancreatic morphology of human with that of pig and goat in terms of length, breadth and weight. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was conducted in the Department of Anatomy, Assam Medical College, Dibrugarh. A total of 90 specimens were included in the study and these were obtained from human, pig and goat. The human specimen (30 in number) were collected from the Forensic Medicine Department of AMCH after fulfilling the official requirements. The specimen of pig and goat (30 each in number) were collected from the local slaughter house after obtaining ethical clearance from the concerned authority. In all specimens, the length, breadth and weight was recorded with the help of measuring tape, vernier callipers and electronic weighing machine. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA Specimen showing signs of putrefaction, any cut or crush injury and congenital anomalies were excluded from the study. RESULT AND OBSERVATIONS In human, the length of the pancreas ranged from 12. 11 to 15. 09 cm. Maximum breadth of the human pancreas ranged from 4. 03 to 5. 12 cm and the weight ranged from 79. 13 to 102. 22 gram. In goat, the length of the pancreas ranged from 12. 43 to 13. 79 cm, the breadth ranged from 3. 03 to 4. 93 cm and the weight ranged from 48. 43 to 70. 03 gram. In pig, the length of the pancreas ranged from 12. 46 to 15. 87 cm. Maximum breadth of pig pancreas ranged from 3. 76 to 4. 78 cm and the weight ranged from 110. 01 to 150. 07 gram...|$|E
40|$|Diagnosis {{of acute}} {{pancreatitis}} (AP) is erroneous {{in up to}} one third of patients when based on clinical criteria and elevated serum amylase values. Furthermore, according to autopsy reports fatal pancreatitis remains clinically undiagnosed in 22 to 86 % of hospitalised patients. Consequently, search for better methods for the diagnosis of AP seems not only justified but urgent. The <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> an nonspecific lipase, the carboxylic ester hydrolase (CEH) with molecular properties different from other pancreatic secretory enzymes. These differences may imply that sites and rates of clearances from blood of pancreatic enzymes differ. Except for the pancreas this enzyme is secreted from the lactating mammary gland with milk. A sensitive and reproducible sandwich-ELISA for quantitative determination of CEH was developed. When establishing referent values {{it was noted that}} in individuals aged 20 to 65 years serum concentrations of CEH did not depend on age, gender, the time of the day or duration from food intake to blood sampling, or use of nicotine. The mammary gland did not contribute significantly to basal serum levels of CEH; enzyme levels in lactating women or women with mammary tumours were identical to those of the reference population. Seventy percent of patients with the diagnosis AP, based on elevated serum amylase levels and abdominal pain, had elevated CEH values. Among the patients with elevated amylase alone a probable cause of pancreatitis was lacking in the majority of patients. Contrastingly, a likely cause of AP could be identified in all patients presenting with abdominal pain and elevated CEH levels alone. These findings suggested that an elevated CEH level indicated AP more reliably than an elevated amylase level. In patients with AP diagnosed by contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) alone, or combined with histopathological diagnosis, serum CEH levels were elevated on admission in all but one patient, and in all within the next 24 h. Furthermore, in patients with severe pancreatitis CEH levels remained at a raised level from the second to at least the 10 :th day following admission, whereas a significant decrease was noted in patients with mild pancreatitis. In contrast, serum amylase values were higher in patients with mild pancreatitis during the observation period than in those with severe pancreatitis. CEH levels were higher in patients with three or more Ranson signs than in those with less than three signs from the first day after admission. CEH levels were within referent range in 164 patients without known pancreatic disease admitted due to abdominal emergency conditions, or due to planned surgery for chronic extrapancreatic gastrointestinal diseases, and 16 patients having CECT without pathological findings in the pancreas. This suggests that AP can be excluded with very high degree of probability in presence of non-elevated CEH levels. A sandwich ELISA for determination of Guinea pig CEH and a model for graded pancreatitis in the same species were developed. CEH levels showed proportional to severity of inflammation, thus confirming previous clinical observations. CEH levels in bile were proportional to inflammation, while it was absent in urine. Amylase levels in urine were identical regardless of severity of inflammation, but low in bile. These results suggested differences in sites and rates of clearance between the two enzymes. Seemingly elevated CEH levels allowed identification of clinically significant pancreatitis following ERCP, which amylase levels did not. The presented studies have shown that quantitative determination in serum of CEH by the described method is a more reliable test for the diagnosis of AP than determination of amylase activity. The differences between CEH and amylase are, at least partly, due to differences in molecular properties determining rates and routes of clearances of the two enzymes from serum. Diss.

40|$|Isolated interlobular ducts {{from the}} {{guinea-pig}} <b>pancreas</b> <b>secrete</b> a HCO 3 −-rich fluid {{in response to}} secretin. To determine the role of Cl− transporters in this process, intracellular Cl− concentration ([Cl−]i) was measured in ducts loaded with the Cl−-sensitive fluoroprobe, 6 -methoxy-N-ethylquinolinium chloride (MEQ). [Cl−]i decreased when the luminal Cl− concentration was reduced. This effect was stimulated by forskolin, was not dependent on HCO 3 − and was not inhibited by application of the anion channel/transporter inhibitor H 2 DIDS to the luminal membrane. It is therefore attributed to a cAMP-stimulated Cl− conductance, probably the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channel. [Cl−]i also decreased when the basolateral Cl− concentration was reduced. This effect was not stimulated by forskolin, was largely dependent on HCO 3 − and was inhibited by basolateral H 2 DIDS. It is therefore mediated mainly by Cl−/HCO 3 − exchange. With high Cl− and low HCO 3 − concentrations in the lumen, steady-state [Cl−]i was 25 - 35 mm in unstimulated cells. Stimulation with forskolin caused [Cl−]i to increase by approximately 4 mm due to activation of the luminal anion exchanger. With low Cl− and high HCO 3 − concentrations in the lumen to simulate physiological conditions, steady-state [Cl−]i was 10 – 15 mm in unstimulated cells. Upon stimulation with forskolin, [Cl−]i fell to approximately 7 mm due to increased Cl− efflux via the luminal conductance. We conclude that, during stimulation under physiological conditions, [Cl−]i decreases to very low levels in guinea-pig pancreatic duct cells, {{largely as a result}} of the limited capacity of the basolateral transporters for Cl− uptake. The resulting lack of competition from intracellular Cl− may therefore favour HCO 3 − secretion via anion conductances in the luminal membrane, possibly CFTR...|$|R

To determine whether the electrochemical potential gradient across the luminal membrane would favor HCO 3 − efflux, we have measured the intracellular potential (Vm) in microperfused, interlobular duct segments under various physiological conditions. When the lumen was perfused with a 124 mM Cl−- 25 mM HCO 3 − solution, a condition similar to the basal state, the resting potential was approximately − 60 mV. Stimulation with dbcAMP or secretin caused a transient hyperpolarization (∼ 5 mV) due to activation of electrogenic Na+-HCO 3 − cotransport at the basolateral membrane. This was followed by depolarization to a steady-state value of approximately − 50 mV as a result of anion efflux across the luminal membrane. Raising the luminal HCO 3 − concentration to 125 mM caused a hyperpolarization (∼ 10 mV) in both stimulated and unstimulated ducts. These results can be explained by a model in which the depolarizing effect of Cl− efflux across the luminal membrane is minimized by the depletion of intracellular Cl− and offset by the hyperpolarizing effects of Na+-HCO 3 − cotransport at the basolateral membrane. The net effect is a luminally directed electrochemical potential gradient for HCO 3 − that is sustained during maximal stimulation. Our calculations indicate that the electrodiffusive efflux of HCO 3 − to the lumen via CFTR, driven by this gradient, would be sufficient to fully account for the observed secretory flux of HCO 3 −...|$|R
