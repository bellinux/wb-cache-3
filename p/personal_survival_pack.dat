40|$|The dissertation, “Architectures of Freedom: Literary Collaboration in Contemporary American Poetry” {{uses the}} praxis of the U. S. third world feminists to analyze {{literary}} collaborations from a contemporary cohort of writers. As developed by Chela Sandoval, the defining {{aspect of the}} praxis of the U. S. third world feminists is differential consciousness. Differential consciousness {{is the ability to}} form coalitions within and beyond different communities not just for <b>personal</b> <b>survival,</b> but through <b>personal</b> <b>survival</b> to transform social oppressions. This dissertation animates Sandoval’s apparatus, which she calls a methodology of the oppressed, to analyze how a current cohort of writers are using literary collaboration to decolonize globalization. The three collaborations the dissertation analyzes are the artblog Pënz (It’s Pronounced Pants), conceptual artists Mendi+Keith Obadike, and Encyclopedia Project, an editorial collaboration. Taken together these three collaborations offer a powerful blueprint for decolonizing globalization for Pënz decolonizes time, M+K decolonizes space (geographic and digital), and Encyclopedia decolonizes knowledge. ...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{aircraft}} evacuation slides: slides and slide/rafts. A slide is for use only on land as a means of escape, although it has sufficient buoyancy to allow passengers to hold on to a lanyard running the length of it {{and use it as a}} buoyancy aid. A slide/raft is an evacuation slide that can be used both as a means of escape in a land evacuation and as a life raft in a landing on water. Slide/rafts usually feature an erectable canopy, outer compartments to hold passengers and <b>survival</b> <b>packs</b> containing items such as leak stoppers, paddles and flares.|$|R

5000|$|Tappan {{published}} what {{is perhaps}} the most important newsletter on survivalism and survivalist retreats in the 1970s, the <b>Personal</b> <b>Survival</b> ("P.S.") Letter. It was published from 1977-1982. The newsletter included columns from Tappan himself as well from Jeff Cooper, Al J. Venter, Bill Pier, Bruce D. Clayton, Rick L. Fines (aka [...] "Ross Lee"), Nancy Mack Tappan, J.B. Wood, Dr. Carl Kirsch, Charles Avery, Karl Hess, Eugene A.

Krupp, and several other writers, some under pen names (such as [...] "Dr. J.M. Browning"). The majority of this newsletter revolved around selecting, constructing and logistically equipping survival retreats. Following Tappan's death in 1980, Nancy Tappan took over the newsletter, renaming it Survival Tomorrow in 1983. In 1987 Carl E. Krupp became the new editor and publisher. The more recent survivalist author James Wesley Rawles credits <b>Personal</b> <b>Survival</b> Letter and Tappan's books as the primary influences in the development of his survivalist philosophy as well as the impetus for launching SurvivalBlog.com.|$|R
