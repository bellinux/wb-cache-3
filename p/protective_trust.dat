2500|$|In the USA, a <b>protective</b> <b>trust</b> {{is a type}} {{of trust}} that was devised for use in estate planning. (In another {{jurisdiction}} this might be thought of as one type of asset protection trust.) Often a person, A, wishes to leave property to another person B. A, however, [...] fears that the property might be claimed by creditors before A dies, and that therefore B would receive none of it. A could establish a trust with B as the beneficiary, but then A would not be entitled to use of the property before they died. Protective trusts were developed as a solution to this situation. A would establish a trust with both A and B as beneficiaries, with the trustee instructed to allow A use of the property until they died, and thereafter to allow its use to B. The property is then safe from being claimed by As creditors, at least so long as the debt was entered into after the trust's establishment. This use of trusts is similar to life estates and remainders, and is frequently used as an alternative to them.|$|E

However many jurisdictions do not permit a trust to be broken where a debtor who remains a discretionary beneficiary only under a trust and cannot access the fund without the exercise of the trustees' discretion in his favour.|$|R
50|$|To give {{protection}} to beneficiaries, a <b>protective</b> <b>trust</b> automatically converts into a discretionary trust, {{under which the}} beneficiary {{has no right to}} the income, if he or she does anything which breaches a condition specified in the document creating the trust.|$|E

5000|$|Such {{protective}} trusts have {{a longstanding}} history. To reduce the verbose definitions {{that had previously}} to be recited in the establishing documents of a <b>protective</b> <b>trust,</b> in England and Wales s33 of the Trustee Act 1925 (and equivalent legislation in other jurisdictions) provides that this protection will arise in any trust described as a [...] "protective trust" [...] in its trust deed.|$|E
500|$|The Act {{gives the}} courts almost {{unlimited}} power {{to exercise their}} jurisdiction to form [...] "compromise" [...] agreements, with Section 1(1) allowing them to approve [...] "any arrangement...varying or revoking all {{or any of the}} trusts or enlarging the powers of the trustees of managing or administering any of the property subject to the trusts". [...] This power can be exercised for people in one of four categories: beneficiaries who are incapable of assenting to the change (infants or those who are otherwise incapable); individuals who may [...] "be entitled" [...] to be beneficiaries in the future, but who are not at present; unborn beneficiaries; or people who may be beneficiaries under <b>protective</b> <b>trusts.</b> The first three classes may only have a [...] "compromise" [...] agreement if the alterations are for their benefit, while potential beneficiaries under <b>protective</b> <b>trusts</b> have no such limit. The courts have chosen to interpret [...] "benefit" [...] widely, increasing their powers to alter trusts; in Re Holt's Settlement [...] 1 All ER 470, Megarry J said that [...] "the word benefit is... plainly not confined to financial benefit, but may extend to social or moral benefit". Under Section 1(3), the Act does not apply to trusts created by an Act of Parliament. The wide scope of the act was quantified in Re Steed's Will Trusts, where the Court of Appeal ruled that the word [...] "arrangement" [...] was [...] "deliberately used in the widest possible senses so as to cover any proposal which any person may put forward for varying or revoking the trusts", essentially allowing the courts the right to make any alteration whatsoever. Despite this, the Court of Appeal noted in Re T's Settlement Trusts [...] Ch 158 that the court would not permit a compromise agreement where it not only varied the terms of the trust but constituted the creation of an entirely new one.|$|R
500|$|The Act {{gave the}} courts near-unlimited {{discretion}} to approve [...] "compromise" [...] agreements, {{for the benefit}} of infants or other incapable individuals, for individuals who may become beneficiaries, or for unborn beneficiaries. The courts are also able to approve agreements for individuals who may be beneficiaries under <b>protective</b> <b>trusts,</b> with no requirement that the alterations be for their benefit. The courts have interpreted the Act's scope fairly widely, stating that almost any [...] "variation" [...] is acceptable, and that [...] "benefit" [...] may mean not just a financial benefit, but also a social or moral one. Despite initial fears that it would allow tax planners another way to hide funds and create a back-and-forth fight between the Chancery Division and Parliament, the Act was met with general approval. The ability of the courts to alter trustees' investment powers under the Act was criticised as slow and expensive, and as a result this is now covered by the Trustee Investments Act 1961.|$|R

40|$|Trusts {{were first}} created in England many centuries ago by {{settling}} property upon <b>protective</b> <b>Trusts</b> whereby the income {{was paid to}} successive generations whilst the corpus was maintained intact thereby avoiding death duty. To prevent this, rules were formulated some 250 years ago to prevent the indefinite "tying-up" of property and these still apply today and are generally {{referred to as the}} Rules Against Perpetuity. In New Zealand these Rules have recently been amended but briefly they are to the effect that property may be placed in Trust for the period of a life in being plus 21 years thereafter or for 80 years. Similarly until the Perpetuities Act, 1964, it was permissible to accumulate income only for a very restricted period and as a result the compilers of Trust Deeds had to be wary that they did not infringe this law which became known as the rule against accumulations. This, however, was abolished with the Perpetuities Act, 1964, and it is now permissible to accumulate income for the full period of the Trust. Many notable authorities have upheld the right of the individual to order his affairs {{in such a way as}} to preserve as much as possible of his funds intact for transmission to his beneficiaries. The classical dictum which has been quoted in many subsequent cases was that of Lord Tomlin in the Duke of Westminister v Inland Revenue Commissioners # 1936 # when he said, "every man is entitled if he can to order his affairs so that the Tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be". Planning an Estate and the introduction of a Trust into that plan requires a careful consideration of many varied, and often conflicting objectives. It also involves assessing existing problems and visualising those that may develop in future...|$|R

The general objective is to strengthen national skills for the assessment and management of risks of biotechnology food products, and to build up public awareness about their benefits and risks in the participant countries, with the ultimate goal to promote their safe and sustainable use within a <b>protective</b> and <b>trusting</b> environment for the public. The first phase has been focused on the evaluation of the political and regulatory systems in Chile, Peru and Colombia, identification of needs, and development of a series of biosafety seminar-workshops in the three countries, with the participation of distinguished foreign experts. The second phase, which started in March 2003, has been extended to six countries of Central America and The Caribbean. The project is helping to identify the weaknesses and needs for the establishment of the biosafety protocol in each participating country. It has also establish the specific training needs and is given the bases for the design of general outlines of biosafety training plans, which will contribute to an efficient implementation of the International Biosafety Protocol. The project it is also allowing to coordinate actions between the countries for a better implementation of the protocol at a regional level. On the other hand, the project has allowed to assemble, around discussion tables, international experts with the main representatives of regulatory and academic institutions, business enterprises and NGOs, as well as with congressmen in scientific and technological matters and the protection of biodiversity. Thus, the project has permitted the establishment of cooperation linkages and has contributed to reinforce the notion of the importance of biosafety for national development and the preservation of local biodiversity...|$|R
5000|$|Bob Griffin was the station's {{long-term}} sportscaster and {{hosted a}} number of local programs, Bob and His Buddies and What's News?, and remains a media personality in Shreveport as he reaches the age of eighty. In a 1964 interview with the since defunct Shreveport Journal, which under the president and publisher Douglas F. Attaway, once owned KSLA, Owen explained that because {{he had always been}} interested in the news, he committed at an early age to become a broadcaster. At first he announced eleven half-hour programs per week, including the commercial minutes, and there were no retakes available if the broadcast was inferior. [...] As KSLA's only news director for three decades, he set the standard in Shreveport television news, recalls Semmie Buffin, the chief KSLA photographer of long standing and an African American. In October 1967, Owen hired Nita Fran Hutcheson, later a chamber of commerce official in her native Texarkana, Texas, as the first female reporter in Shreveport television. Hutcheson recalls that Owen was highly <b>protective</b> of the <b>trust</b> that he had developed from his long-term viewers. A local columnist once called him [...] "the Walter Cronkite of the Shreveport media market," [...] a reference to the CBS anchorman from 1962 until 1981. Owen also hired Margaret Pelley of NBC's Dateline, Roseanne Colletti, who went on to report for WNBC-TV, as well as local figures Wray Post, Tom and Barry Irwin, Carl Pendley, and Tony Taglavore. [...] Owen was {{a past president of the}} Louisiana and Mississippi AP Broadcasters and the Louisiana/Mississippi United Press International. In 1963, 1964, and 1965, the Associated Press named him [...] "Broadcaster of the Year". Some of his articles on a variety of topics were published in Shreveport Magazine.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background During {{the course}} of an {{influenza}} pandemic, governments know relatively little about the possibly changing influence of government trust, risk perception, and receipt of information on the public's intention to adopt protective measures or on the acceptance of vaccination. This study aims to identify and describe possible changes in and factors associated with public's intentions during the 2009 influenza A (H 1 N 1) pandemic in the Netherlands. Methods Sixteen cross-sectional telephone surveys were conducted (N = 8060) between April - November 2009. From these repeated measurements three consecutive periods were categorized based on crucial events during the influenza A (H 1 N 1) pandemic. Time trends in government trust, risk perception, intention to adopt protective measures, and the acceptance of vaccination were analysed. Factors associated with an intention to adopt protective measures or vaccination were identified. Results Trust in the government was high, but decreased over time. During {{the course of}} the pandemic, perceived vulnerability and an intention to adopt <b>protective</b> measures increased. <b>Trust</b> and vulnerability were associated with an intention to adopt protective measures in general only during period one. Higher levels of intention to receive vaccination were associated with increased government trust, fear/worry, and perceived vulnerability. In periods two and three receipt of information was positively associated with an intention to adopt protective measures. Most respondents wanted to receive information about infection prevention from municipal health services, health care providers, and the media. Conclusions The Dutch response to the H 1 N 1 virus was relatively muted. Higher levels of trust in the government, fear/worry, and perceived vulnerability were all positively related to an intention to accept vaccination. Only fear/worry was positively linked to an intention to adopt protective measures during the entire pandemic.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{practice}} of making datasets publicly {{available for use}} by the wider scientific community has become firmly integrated in genomic science. One significant gap in literature around data sharing concerns how it impacts on scientists' ability to preserve values and ethical standards that form an essential component of scientific collaborations. We conducted a qualitative sociological study examining the potential for harm to ethnic groups, and implications of such ethical concerns for data sharing. We focused our empirical work on the MalariaGEN Consortium, one of the first international collaborative genomics research projects in Africa. METHODS: We conducted a study in three MalariaGEN project sites in Kenya, the Gambia, and the United Kingdom. The study entailed analysis of project documents and 49 semi-structured interviews with fieldworkers, researchers and ethics committee members. RESULTS: Concerns about how best to address the potential for harm to ethnic groups in MalariaGEN crystallised in discussions about the development of a data sharing policy. Particularly concerning for researchers was how best to manage the sharing of genomic data outside of the original collaboration. Within MalariaGEN, genomic data is accompanied by information about the locations of sample collection, the limitations of consent and ethics approval, and the values and relations that accompanied sample collection. For interviewees, this information and context were of important ethical value in safeguarding against harmful uses of data, but is not customarily shared with secondary data users. This challenged the ability of primary researchers to protect against harmful uses of 'their' data. CONCLUSION: We identified three <b>protective</b> mechanisms [...] <b>trust,</b> the existence of a shared morality, and detailed contextual understanding [...] which together might {{play an important role in}} preventing the use of genomic data in ways that could harm the ethnic groups included in the study. We suggest that the current {{practice of}} sharing of datasets as isolated objects rather than as embedded within a particular scientific culture, without regard for the normative context within which samples were collected, may cause ethical tensions to emerge that could have been prevented or addressed had the 'ethical metadata' that accompanies genomic data also been shared...|$|R
