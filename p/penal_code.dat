5|$|In Singapore, {{attempted}} suicide, abetment of suicide, and abetment {{of attempted}} suicide are criminal acts. This applies to physicians who aid patients in ending their lives.

Three states have abolished the defense altogether.|$|E

A comparison is given between different reactions of the incumbents to entry in terms of sustainability of collusion, incumbents’ profits, entrant’s profits, consumer surplus and social welfare.
