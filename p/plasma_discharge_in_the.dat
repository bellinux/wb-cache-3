Such a thruster would be employed in space for applications such as orbit raining, orbit maneuvering, station change, and possibly trans-lunar or trans-planetary propulsion of spacecraft. The MET concept employs low frequency continuous wave (CW) microwave power to create and continuously pump energy into a flowing propellant gas at relative high pressure via a plasma discharge. The propellant is heated to very high bulk temperatures while passing through the plasma discharge region and then is expanded through a throat-nozzle assembly to produce thrust, as in a conventional rocket engine. Apparatus, which is described, is being assembled at NASA Lewis to test the MET concept to CW power levels of 30 kW at a frequency of 915 MHz. The microwave energy is applied in a resonant cavity applicator and is absorbed by a <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flowing propellant.

40|$|There {{is a great}} {{interest}} in evaporative deposition systems with simultaneous self-ion bombardment for manufacturing high quality thin films for electronics, optics and mechanics. In these systems, ions are generated in different kinds of low pressure plasma discharges (e. g. RF inductive discharge) that are excited in the flow of deposited material vapor. Continuous discharges are often used but the pulsed mode of ones is attractive too [1, 2].

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of a direct-current, nonequilibrium glow <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of a Mach 2. 85 supersonic flow is presented. The discharge is generated with pinlike electrodes flush-mounted on a plane surface with sustaining currents between 25 to 300 mA. In {{the presence of a}} supersonic flow, two distinct discharge modes (diffuse and constricted) are observed depending on the flow and discharge operating conditions. The effect of the discharge on the flow (“plasma actuation”) is characterized by the appearance of aweak shockwave {{in the vicinity of the}} discharge. The shock is observed at low powers (10 W) for the diffuse discharge mode but is absent for the higher power (100 W) constricted mode. High-speed laser schlieren imaging suggests that plasma actuation is rapid as it occurs on a time scale that is less than 220 s. Rotational (gas) and vibrational temperature within the discharge are estimated by emission spectral linefits ofN 2 andN 2 rovibronic bands near 365 – 395 nm. The electronic temperatures are estimated by using the Boltzmann plot method for Fe(I) atomic lines. Rotational temperatures are found to be high (1500 K) in the absence of a flow but drop sharply (500 K) in the presence of a supersonic flow for both the diffuse and constricted discharge modes. The vibrational and electronic temperatures are measured to be about 3000 K and 1. 25 eV, respectively, and these temperatures are the same with and without flow. The gas temperature spatial profiles above the cathode surface are similar for the diffuse and constricted modes indicating that dilatational effects due to gas heating are similar. However, complete absence of flow actuation as indicated visually by the shock indicates that electrostatic forces may also play an important role in high-speed plasma-flow actuation phenomena. Analytical estimates using cathode sheath theory indicate that ion pressure within sheath can be significant, resulting in gas compression within sheath and a corresponding expansion above it. The expansion, in turn, may fully negate the dilatational effect in the constricted case resulting in an apparent absence of forcing in the constricted case...|$|E
40|$|Hall 2 De is a first-principles, 2 -D {{axisymmetric}} {{code that}} solves the {{equations of motion}} for ions, electrons, and neutrals on a magnetic-field-aligned grid. The computational domain downstream of the acceleration channel exit plane {{is large enough to}} include self-consistently the cathode boundary. In this paper, we present results from numerical simulations of the H 6 laboratory thruster with an internally mounted cathode, with the aim of highlighting the importance of properly accounting for the interactions between the ion beam and cathode plume. The anomalous transport of electrons across magnetic field lines in Hall 2 De is modelled using an anomalous collision frequency, anom, yielding anom approximately equal to omega ce (i. e., the electron cyclotron frequency) in the plume. We first show that restricting the anomalous collision frequency to only regions where the current density of ions is large does not alter the <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hall thruster as long as the interaction between the ion beam and the cathode plume is captured properly in the computational domain. This implies that the boundary conditions must be placed sufficiently far as to not interfere with the electron transport in this region. These simulation results suggest that electron transport across magnetic field lines occurs largely inside the beam and may be driven by the interactions between beam ions and electrons. A second finding that puts in relevance the importance of including the cathode plume in numerical simulations is on the significance of accounting for the ion acoustic turbulence (IAT), now known to occur {{in the vicinity of the}} cathode exit. We have included in the Hall 2 De simulations a model of the IAT-driven anomalous collision frequency based on Sagdeev's model for saturation of the ion-acoustic instability. This implementation has allowed us to achieve excellent agreement with experimental measurements in the near plume obtained during the operation of the H 6 thruster at nominal conditions (300 V, 20 A) and chamber background pressure of approximately 1. 5 x 10 (exp - 5) Torr. In addition, the numerical results obtained with the latter approach exhibit less sensitivity to background pressure than previous attempts at explaining the features of the plasma properties in the near plume...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the general {{features of a}} new heating process developed by <b>the</b> authors <b>in</b> order to conduct steel annealing in a potentially more economical and more efficient fashion than conventional technologies. This process consists of generating a cold <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>in</b> argon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of the steel surface. The discharge is generated between the steel surface, cathode of the system, and the anode facing it. The steel heating results from the bombardment of its surface by energetic neutrals and ions. Conventional low carbon steel annealing cycles have been reproduced at laboratory scale with this new annealing technology and led to equivalent metallurgical properties. Moreover this new plasma annealing technology allowed the opportunity for new annealing cycles with higher heating rate (up to several hundreds of K/s), shorter soaking time and controlled cooling rate, so that well recrystallized samples were achieved {{in a few seconds}} total process time. Experimental evidence shows that process parameters such as the heating and cooling rates, the maximum annealing temperature and the soaking time strongly influence the recrystallization process and the metallurgical texture development, hence the steel mechanical properties. In conclusion, this paper indicates clearly that, at least for low carbon steel annealing, thanks to this new plasma annealing technology, the total annealing time can be significantly reduced compared to the time required by the industrial continuous annealing process used today to obtain equivalent metallurgical properties.

An improved Sobel edge detection algorithm using iterative threshold was proposed to detect <b>plasma</b> boundary. EAST <b>discharge</b> results show that the proposed method acquired plasma position and boundary with high accuracy, which is of great significance for better plasma control.|$|R
40|$|Gaseous plasma antennas {{constitute}} a promising alternative to conventional metallic antennas for applications in which reconfigurability is desired. By tuning the <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> parameters, e. g., plasma density, antenna properties {{can be changed}} dynamically. In this work we report on recent numerical investigations into {{the characteristics of a}} plasma antenna {{as a function of the}} <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> parameters, viz., <b>plasma</b> density, and magnetostatic field. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> effect of different gasses has been examined. We have used ADAMANT (Advanced coDe for Anisotropic Media and ANTennas) - a full-wave numerical tool based on integral equations - to assess the role played by <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> parameters <b>in</b> shaping <b>the</b> radiation pattern, which is mainly determined by the plasma current distribution. The experimental characterization of the <b>plasma</b> <b>discharge</b> to be used as plasma antenna is briefly presente...|$|R
