These neighborhoods, such as Helderberg, New Scotland/Woodlawn, and Pine Hills, tend to have larger lots and more suburban surroundings than the neighborhoods nearer to the Hudson River. Further west, the neighborhoods become more affluent and are dominated almost exclusively by single-family dwellings. The western portion of the City includes the W.

50|$|St James House is {{considered}} to be a good representation of the burgage tenements that were common during Medieval times (link to glossary below). Its origins as a burgage are most evident at the rear of the property. The current, 18th-century facade was a later addition. Burgage tenements were rental properties that were often long and narrow plots of land, particularly in towns where <b>frontage</b> <b>property</b> along a street was at a premium. The gable (narrow) end of a house on a burgage plot usually faced the street. The classical style was in vogue during the 18th century, the consequence of which was that many burgage houses received new brick facades. Such was the case with St James House.|$|R

50|$|The canal {{opened to}} {{transport}} in 1831 {{and became an}} important partner in the economy of south Georgia.

Cotton, rice, bricks, guano, naval stores, peaches, and other goods also traversed the canal. Later in the century, the canal suffered a gradual decline. Heavy June rains seriously damaged the canal embankments in 1876 coupled with a yellow fever epidemic which fatally inflicted over 1,000 individuals.

The frontage on the latter is nearly 59 feet and on Wall Street 39.5 feet. Taken in connection with the southeast corner of Wall Street and Broadway, it makes a compact spot. The corner is owned by the Benjamin D. Silliman (lawyer) estate, and there is supposed to be an understanding between the owners of the two parcels that both will act in unison. It was reported months ago that a large office building would be constructed on the combined plots. The property was reported owned by Smith in 1901 when the Hanover National Bank occupied its basement as its own Hanover National Bank Building headquarters were under construction on Nassau and Pine Streets. The lease negotiated by George R. Read, agent for the property. He held the building until his death and bequeathed it with the Eagle Building on Pearl Street to Columbia University but Columbia's trustees declined the gift and his estate executor's held on to it until 1916 when it went into foreclosure. The property was L-shaped and hugged what became the most expensive per square foot real estate plot in the world, sold in 1905 for $4 a square inch.|$|R
