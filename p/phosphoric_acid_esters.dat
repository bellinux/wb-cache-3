40|$|A {{flow-sheet}} for {{the recovery}} of actinides from TBP-Na 2 CO 3 scrub-waste solutions has been developed, based on batch extraction data, and tested, using laboratory-scale countercurrent extraction techniques. The process, called the ARALEX process, uses 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol (2 -EHOH) to extract the TBP degradation products (HDBP and H/sub 2 /MBP) from acidified Na 2 CO 3 scrub waste leaving the actinides in the aqueous phase. Dibutyl and monobutyl phosphoric acids {{are attached to the}} 2 -EHOH molecules through hydrogen bonds, which also diminish the ability of the HDBP and H 2 /MBP to complex actinides. Thus all actinides remain in the aqueous raffinate. Dilute sodium hydroxide solutions can be used to back-extract the dibutyl and monobutyl <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> as their sodium salts. The 2 -EHOH can then be recycled. After extraction of the acidified carbonate waste with 2 -EHOH, the actinides may be readily extracted from the raffinate with DHDECMP or, in the case of tetra- and hexavalent actinides, with TBP. The ARALEX process can also be applied to other actinide waste streams which contain appreciable concentrations of polar organic compounds (e. g., detergents) that interfere with conventional actinide ion exchange and liquid-liquid extraction procedures...|$|E

This pest is of particular economic importance in Essex County, Ontario, where cucumber culture under glass is a major commercial practice. Each year mite infestations result in a ten to fifteen per cent loss of a $ 3, 000, 000 crop. The recently developed aerosols of parathion and related <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> have been highly effective against active forms but have had little or no ovicidal effect. Such controls are costly as they must be repeated at intervals of time to prevent further mite population build-up from the unaffected eggs.

Many workers have, therefore, turned their attention to the investigation of non-chemical methods of controlling these mites on greenhouse plants. One suggestion has been that controls might be effected by the manipulation of plant nutrients in the soil (Page, 1946; Rodriguez and Neiswander, 1949).

This enzyme displays maximum catalytic efficiency (k(cat) /K-m) at pH 4. 5, whereas its catalytic rate constant (k(cat)) is maximal at near-neutral pH, and, in contrast to other PAPs, its catalytic parameters are not dependent on the pK(a) of the leaving group.

Structural comparisons of the active site of sweet potato, red kidney bean, and mammalian PAPs show several amino acid substitutions in the sweet potato enzyme that can account for its increased catalytic efficiency. The phosphate molecule binds in an unusual tripodal mode to the two metal ions, with two of the phosphate oxygen atoms binding to Fe(III) and Mn(II), a third oxygen atom bridging the two metal ions, and the fourth oxygen pointing toward the substrate binding pocket.

We review {{the spectrum of}} symptoms and signs in OP poisoning {{as well as the}} different approaches to clinical features in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles were obtained by electronic search of PubMed(®) between 1966 and April 2014 using the search terms organophosphorus compounds or <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> AND poison or poisoning AND manifestations. RESULTS: Of the 5026 articles on OP poisoning, 2584 articles pertained to human poisoning; 452 articles focusing on clinical manifestations in human OP poisoning were retrieved for detailed evaluation. In addition to the traditional approach of symptoms and signs of OP poisoning as peripheral (muscarinic, nicotinic) and central nervous system receptor stimulation, symptoms were alternatively approached using a time-based classification. In this, symptom onset was categorized as acute (within 24 -h), delayed (24 -h to 2 -week) or late (beyond 2 -week). Although most symptoms occur with minutes or hours following acute exposure, delayed onset symptoms occurring after a period of minimal or mild symptoms, may impact treatment and timing of the discharge following acute exposure. Symptoms and signs were also viewed as an organ specific as cardiovascular, respiratory or neurological manifestations. An organ specific approach enables focused management of individual organ dysfunction that may vary with different OP compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Different approaches to the symptoms and signs in OP poisoning may better our understanding of the underlying mechanism that in turn may assist with the management of acutely poisoned patients.

It has been proposed that char produced from biomass may be crushed and then suspended in water to produce a char-water fuel suitable as a heavy oil replacement. Experiments were conducted by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transfer infrared spectrometry (FTIR) to measure the effect of the chemical additives diammonium phosphate (DAP) or monoammonium phosphate (MAP) on the mass-loss processes of SCB when heated between 100 °C and 700 °C under nitrogen. The additives were impregnated on the SCB as aqueous solutions at concentrations of between 0. 01 M and 1. 0 M. For untreated bagasse, char yield was 18 wt % at 400 °C and 16. 5 wt % at 700 °C. For treated SCB, it was observed that the additives initiated mass loss at lower temperatures and produced significantly larger yields of char than untreated bagasse. When heated to 450 °C, the char yield increased with additive concentration. If heated above 450 °C, another mass loss occurred between 450 °C and 600 °C, but only for those SCB samples treated with additives at concentrations greater than 0. 1 M. Thus, when heated to 700 °C the maximum yield of char occurred for SCB sample treated with 0. 1 M additives. Analyses of the evolved pyrolysis gases using FTIR showed that treated SCB, at concentrations greater than 0. 1 M DAP or MAP, contained less hydrocarbon species and were enriched in water consistent with the catalytic degradation of the SCB.

To probe the role of the Fe-O(phenolate) bond, the phenolate moiety was modified to contain electron-donating or -withdrawing groups (-CH(3), -H, -Br, -NO(2)) in the 5 -position. Tie effects of the substituents on the electronic properties of the biomimetic complexes were studied with a range of experimental and computational techniques. This study establishes benchmarks against accurate crystallographic struck ral information using spectroscopic techniques that are not restricted to single crystals. Kinetic studies on the hydrolysis reaction revealed that the phosphodiesterase activity increases in the order -NO(2) <- Br <- H <- CH(3) when 2, 4 -bis(dinitrophenyl) phosphate (2, 4 -bdnpp) was used as substrate, and a linear free energy relationship is found when log(k(cat) /k(0)) is plotted against the Hammett parameter a. However, nuclease activity measurements in the cleavage of double stranded DNA showed that the complexes containing the electron-withdrawing -NO(2) and electron-donating CH 3 groups are the most active while the cytotoxic activity of the biomimetics on leukemia and lung tumoral cells is highest for complexes with electron-donating groups.

40|$|Bioisosteric {{replacements}} {{are used}} in drug design during lead generation and optimization processes with the aim to replace one functional group of a known molecule by another while retaining biological activity. The reason to use bioisosteric replacements are typically to optimize bioavailability or reducing toxicity. Phosphate groups represent a paradigm to study bioisosteric replacements. Protein-phosphate interaction plays a critical role during molecular recognition processes, and for example kinases represent {{one of the largest}} families of drug targets. However, some challenges exclude phosphate as a promising lead-like building block: i) charged phosphates do not cross molecular membranes; ii) some widely expressed proteins such as phosphatases easily hydrolyze <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>esters,</b> which lead phosphate-containing ligands to lose their binding affinities before reaching their biological targets; iii) introduction of phosphate groups to parent scaffold is not easy. In {{the first part of the}} thesis work, I designed and implemented a computational protocol to mine information about phosphate structural replacements deposited in the Protein Data Bank. I constructed 116, 314, 271, and 42 sets of superimposed proteins where each set contains a reference protein to either POP, AMP, ADP, or ATP as well as a certain number of non-nucleotide ligands. 929 of such ligands are under study. The chemotypes that came out as structural replacements are diverse, ranging from common phosphate isosteres such as carboxyl, amide and squaramide to more surprising moieties such as benzoxaborole and aromatic ring systems. I exemplified some novel examples and interpreted the mechanism behind them. Local structural replacements are circumstance dependent: one chemical group valid in certain set-up cannot necessarily guarantee the success of another. The data from the study is available at [URL] In the second part, I synthesized fifteen compounds retaining the adenosine moieties and bearing bioisosteric replacements of the phosphate at the ribose 5 '-oxygen to test their stability toward human macro domain protein 1. These compounds are composed of either a squaryldiamide or an amide group as the bioisosteric replacement and/or as a linker. To these groups a variety of substituents were attached: phenyl, benzyl, pyridyl, carboxyl, hydroxy and tetrazolyl. Biological evaluation using differential scanning fluorimetry showed that four compounds stabilized human MDO 1 at levels comparable to ADP and one at level comparable to AMP. Virtual screening was also run to identify MDO 1 binding ligands. Among 20, 000 FIMM database lead-like molecules, 39 compounds were selected for testing and eleven compounds found active based on ADPr and Poly-ADPr competition binding assay. The assay is however not well validated and a second confirmatory assay was conducted using calorimetry. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first report of non-endogenous ligands of the human MDO 1. Altogether, this thesis highlights the versatility of molecular recognition processes that accompanies chemical replacements in compounds; this in turns shows the limits of the concepts of molecular similarity and classical bioisosterism that are based on the conservation of molecular interactions. Bioisosteeristä korvausta käytetään lääkeainekehityksessä johtolankamolekyylien tuottamisessa ja optimoinnissa. Tarkoitus on vaihtaa molekyylin funktionaalinen ryhmä toiseksi biologisen aktiivisuuden muuttumatta. Yleensä tavoitteena on parantaa biologista hyötyosuutta tai vähentää toksisuutta. Fosfaattiryhmää on tässä työssä käytetty esimerkkiryhmänä bioisosteerisiä korvauksia tutkittaessa. Väitöskirjatyön ensimmäisessä osassa suunnittelin ja toteutin tiedonlouhintaprotokollan etsiäkseni Protein Data Bank -tietokannasta korvaavia rakenteita fosfaattiryhmälle. Kokosin 116, 314, 271 ja 42 proteiiniryhmää, joissa kussakin on vertailumolekyylinä fosfaattiryhmän sisältävä POP, AMP, ADP tai ATP, ja lisäksi ei-nukleotidisiä ligandeja. Yhteensä 929 ei-nukleotidistä ligandia tutkittiin. Niistä löydettiin monipuolisesti fosfaattiryhmän korvaavia rakenteita, muun muassa yleisesti tunnettuja fosfaatin bioisosteerejä kuten karboksyyli, amidi ja squaramidi, mutta myös erikoisempia ryhmiä kuten bentsoksaboroli ja aromaattisia rengasrakenteita. Työssäni esittelen muutamia uusia rakenteita ja tulkitsen niiden vaikutusmekanismeja. Rakenteiden korvaaminen riippuu tilanteesta; yhteen tapaukseen sopiva korvaava ryhmä ei välttämättä toimi toisessa. Työn toisessa osassa syntetisoin 15 adenosiiniyhdistettä, joiden riboosiosan 5 '-hapessa oleva fosfaattiryhmä on korvattu vaihtelevalla bioisosteerisellä ryhmällä. Bioisosteerisenä ryhmänä tai linkkerinä oli joko squaramidi- tai amidiryhmä. Yhdisteiden vakaus testattiin ihmisen MDO 1 -makrodomeeniproteiinin kanssa...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{emerging}} {{potential of}} α-tocopheryl phosphate, a <b>phosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>ester</b> of α-tocopherol, in health benefits was tested gavaging this compound (5  mg/kg body wt) {{to a group}} of rats for a period of thirty days while the control rats were given water only. After thirty days, the rats were sacrificed, the hearts excised, and the isolated hearts were perfused by working mode. Both control and experimental hearts were subjected to 30 -min global ischemia followed by 2  h of reperfusion. The tocopheryl phosphate fed rats exhibited significant cardioprotection as evidenced by improved ventricular performance and reduced myocardial infarct size and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Supplementation with α-tocopheryl phosphate converted MAP kinase-induced death signal into a survival signal by enhancing anti-apoptotic p 42 / 44 ERK kinase and p 38 MAPKβ and reducing pro-apoptotic proteins p 38 MAPKα and JNK. In concert, the phosphorylation of pro-apoptotic c-Src was also reduced. Tocopheryl phosphate increased the DNA binding of the redox-sensitive transcription factor NFκB and potentiated the activation of anti-death protein Bcl- 2 and survival signaling protein Akt. The results of this study demonstrated {{for the first time that}} tocopheryl phosphate could ameliorate myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury by converting ischemia/reperfusion-mediated death signal into a survival signal by modulating MAP kinase signaling...|$|R
