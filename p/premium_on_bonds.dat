Our analysis reveals that {{the reduction in the}} interest rate <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> <b>bonds</b> over the deposit rate is an important pre-requisite for the DFI to raise its market share in both investment finance and working capital lending.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop and test a model of the {{probability}} of default on corporate bonds that is based upon the tenets of the contingent claims literature. Equity is considered a call option on the firm’s assets, with the exercise price being the face value of the firm’s debt. Using this framework, a model is developed with the probability of default as a function of five variables-firm value, face value of the debt, time to maturity of the debt, instantaneous return and standard deviation of firm value. The model is found to be statistically signifi-cant, explains approximately 54 percent of the variation in the bond ratings, and correctly classifies, 68 percent and 66 percent of the bonds in an initial and holdout sample, respectively, according to their agency ratings. The model is also found to provide a reasonable estimate of the probability of default. Merton (1974) developed a contingent claims model for pricing corporate debt that is based on the Black and Scholes (1973) option pricing model. Using this option pricing framework, corporate liabilities are viewed as combinations of option contracts defined by their cash flows and boundary conditions. Under Mer-ton’s model, the theoretical measure of the default risk <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> <b>bonds</b> vali-dates the conventional measure-the difference between the yield on a risky bond and a riskless bond with the same maturity. Jones, Mason and Rosenfeld (1984, 1985) extend Merton’s (1974) model to include the sinking fund provision and generalize the model to allow for multiple issues of a given firm’s debt. Ogden (1987) empirically tests this modified version of the contingent claims model. His study compares the modified contingent claims model of the default risk premium with market yield premiums. The model yield premiums explain nearly 60 % of the variation in market yield premiums...|$|E

The results generally support an optimistic view of the market discipline hypothesis, with credit markets providing incentives for sovereign borrowers to restrain borrowing.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to examine how investors {{acknowledge}} the four variables; earnings variability, period of solvency, equity/debt ratio and bonds outstanding to determine the risk <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> corporate <b>bonds</b> <b>on</b> the Swedish market.

Unfortunately, the limited supply and the illiquidity of the Swedish corporate bond market affected the validity of our research. The results of the study were inconclusive. According to our results, the investors on the Swedish market do acknowledge the length of time a company has been solvent and the amount of bonds outstanding of a firm when determining the risk premium of corporate bonds.

40|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Greek crisis has revived {{the literature on the}} sovereign debt spreads. Recent evidence has shed new lights on the main determinants of interest rates spreads. The sharp increase of government bond yields cannot be entirely attributed to changes in macroeconomic fundamentals. Contagion effects can occur and self-fulfilling speculation may arise. Yet, this literature has been mainly empirical and needs sound theoretical foundations. The aim {{of this paper is to}} fill in this gap. We develop a simple model in the spirit of second generation currency crises models developed by (Obstfled, 1996). The model describes a strategic game between governments and financial markets. Eurozone countries face a trade-off as governments may either commit and implement restrictive fiscal policies or default on debt. The cost of the commitment strategy increases when interest rates increase or when the fiscal multipliers are high. This leaves the opportunity for speculators to drive the economy towards a bad equilibrium, forcing the government to renege its commitment. We introduce a source of uncertainty about the cost of default in the model. By this way, we may introduce the possibility that governments do not default although risk <b>premiums</b> <b>on</b> <b>bond</b> yield is high...|$|R

40|$|This paper shows that, {{contrary}} to the suggestion of some investment advisors, for an individual Canadian investor subject to personal income taxation, the after-tax return <b>on</b> a discount <b>bond</b> is always higher (or, at worse, equal) to the return on an otherwise identical premium bond. This follows because the tax rate on capital gains {{is lower than the}} tax rate on coupon income in Canada. It is also shown that a decline in the capital gains tax rate raises the after-tax yield <b>on</b> discount <b>bonds,</b> but reduces the after-tax yield <b>on</b> <b>premium</b> <b>bonds,</b> and may even cause the yield <b>on</b> <b>premium</b> <b>bonds</b> to become negative. Further, a cut in the tax rate on interest income raises the after-tax yield <b>on</b> all <b>bonds,</b> but raises the yield <b>on</b> <b>premium</b> <b>bonds</b> relative to discount bonds. While the lower after-tax returns <b>on</b> higher coupon <b>bonds</b> might be expected to cause the pre-tax yields <b>on</b> these <b>bonds</b> to rise, no evidence of such tax capitalization is found using a large dataset of matched pairs of Government of Canada bonds for the period 1986 - 2006. The observed near equality of pre-tax yields since 1995 for otherwise equivalent bonds with different coupons implies that individuals in Canada earn a significantly smaller after-tax return from holding premium bonds than discount bonds. The empirical analysis suggests that the marginal investor in the bond market is an investor who pays the same rate of tax on capital gains and interest income, such as professional investors, financial institutions or pension funds, rather than an individual taxpayer...|$|R
40|$|How can {{the euro}} area's return to fiscal {{sustainability}} be organised {{in view of}} soaring debt levels and the sovereign debt crisis? How can we finance our debts efficiently, not least to prevent debt crises in weaker countries where high debt levels compounded by a hike in risk <b>premiums</b> <b>on</b> government <b>bonds</b> can create a debt trap?
