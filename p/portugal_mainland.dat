40|$|The August 2003 heat-wave {{accounted}} for {{an excess of}} more than 1900 deaths in Portugal. At the European level it is acknowledged that this heat-wave was responsible for an excess of about 70000 deaths. In both situations {{a considerable number of}} deaths seem to have occurred in hospitals. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the association between hospital existence of AC and the in hospital mortality rate during the 2003 heat-wave in <b>Portugal</b> <b>mainland.</b> A historic cohort design was used, including all patients with aged 45 or more, hospitalized during the last 7 days before the beginning of 2003 ’s heat-wave, and, therefore exposed to excess heat only in hospital. The study endpoint was the survival of patients in the 18 days of the heat-wave plus two days. This endpoint was compared between patients in services with air-conditioning (AC+) against patients in services without air-conditioning (AC-). Data was obtained from the National Hospital Discharge Database. Information on the air-conditioning existence was obtained by a survey of hospital administrations during 2007. The association between the survival of patients and being hospitalized in AC+ services was assessed with a Cox regression model that has included the covariates sex, age, hospital region, type of service, and main diagnosis at discharge as potential confounders. From all the hospitals of <b>Portugal</b> <b>mainland</b> 41 (54 %) participated in the study (2093 patients). Statistical significant differences were found between patients hospitalized in AC+ versus AC- services. The hazard ratio of death for patients in AC+ services versus patients in AC- services was 0. 60 (95 % CI= 0. 37 - 0. 97).

40|$|Gas {{hydrates}} in sub-seabed sediments is an unexploited {{source of}} energy with estimated reserves larger than those of conventional oil. One of the methods for recovering methane from gas hydrates involves injection of Carbon Dioxide (CO 2), causing the dissociation of methane and storing CO 2. The occurrence of gas hydrates offshore Portugal is well known associated to mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz. This article presents a determination of the areas with conditions {{for the formation of}} biogenic gas hydrates in <b>Portugal’s</b> <b>mainland</b> geological continental margin and assesses their overlap with CO 2 hydrates stability zones defined in previous studies. The gas hydrates stability areas are defined using a transfer function recently published by other authors and takes into account the sedimentation rate, the particulate organic carbon content and the thickness of the gas hydrate stability zone. An equilibrium equation for gas hydrates, function of temperature and pressure, was adjusted using non-linear regression and the maximum stability zone thickness was found to be 798 m. The gas hydrates inventory was conducted in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment and a full compaction scenario was adopted, with localized vertical flow assumed in the accrecionary wedge where mud volcanoes occur. Four areas where temperature and pressure conditions may exist for formation of gas hydrates were defined at an average of 60 km from <b>Portugal’s</b> <b>mainland</b> coastline. Two of those areas coincide with CO 2 hydrates stability areas previously defined and should be the subject of further research to evaluate the occurrence of gas hydrate and the possibility of its recovery coupled with CO 2 storage in sub-seabed sediments...|$|R

40|$|Introduction and objectives: Pulmonary {{tuberculosis}} (PTB) is {{the most}} common form of Tuberculosis and highly associated with airborne transmission. Time series analysis is a methodology highly valuable in the assessment of health trends and control program performance. The present study applies Dynamic Regression models in order to potentially contribute to a better characterization of the PTB monthly incidence rates in <b>Portugal</b> <b>mainland</b> and the impact of lagged predictor variables. Materials and Methods: Monthly PTB incidence rates (per 100, 000 population) for <b>Portugal</b> <b>mainland</b> were analyzed, from 2000 to 2009. Dynamic regression models were employed to study PTB time series behavior and its association with up to six months lagged predictor variables. The predictor variables in the dynamic model were calculated as monthly proportions of TB cases that were alcohol consumers, smokers, drug users, inmates, homeless, HIV positive, community home, a new PTB case, immigrants from a high risk country and belonging to a certain age group. Results: A dynamic regression model with SARIMA(2, 1, 0) (1, 0, 0) 12 structure for the errors revealed to be the best-fit model to monthly PTB incidence rates. Forecasts were performed for the year 2010. The predicted values were very close to the observed PTB monthly incidence rates for the year 2010. Overall, estimated future projections indicate a persistence of the decreasing trend in year 2010, with a peak in April and trough in December. We have seen that the model with predictor variables is better (in terms of fitting and forecasting) than the SARIMA model without predictors. Discussion and Conclusion: Understanding what characterizes patients who suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis is of great importance when establishing screening strategies to better control tuberculosis disease. Dynamic regression models with ARIMA errors prove to be useful in identifying high-risk groups associated with PTB incidence rates that should be targeted by control programs and in performing accurate predictions. Forecast analysis shown that the past pattern modeled herein will continue into the future. However, such assumption may not be valid in the near future, given that Portugal entered an economic crisis in 2008 which can affect the PTB incidence rates...|$|E
