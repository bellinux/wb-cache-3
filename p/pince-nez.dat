5|$|The Earl {{can be a}} {{grotesque}} caricature of a Victorian gentleman: a rotund figure in cape and top hat (hiding his horns), with a perpetual enormous grin and <b>pince-nez</b> spectacles. Although his attitude is often cheerful, he is quick to reveal his more intimidating, malicious side. The Earl has a golem named , a pink umbrella with a small, talking jack-o-lantern at its tip. It usually talks excitedly or screams, adding {{its name to the}} end of almost every sentence. Lero, used by the Earl as a Mary Poppins-type flying umbrella, is very loyal to him and guards his sword. Road often takes Lero against its will, using it as a witch's broom or an ordinary umbrella. It {{has been used as a}} beacon to summon Akuma, to transport several exorcists to the Ark and to guard the Noah. Lero has a sword similar to Allen Walker's sword of exorcism, which surprises him when they clash on Noah's Ark. Despite his antipathy to the Noah Nea, the Earl grows depressed when he talks about him.|$|E

25|$|The {{inspiration}} for the recurring motif of screaming mouths in many Bacons of the late 1940s and early 1950s was drawn {{from a number of}} sources, including medical text books, the works of Matthias Grünewald and photographic stills of the nurse in the Odessa Steps scene in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent The Battleship Potemkin. Bacon saw the film in 1935, and viewed it frequently thereafter. He kept in his studio a photographic still of the scene, showing a close-up of the nurse's head screaming in panic and terror and with broken <b>pince-nez</b> spectacles hanging from her blood-stained face. He referred to the image throughout his career, using it as a source of inspiration.|$|E

500|$|George Boldt (1851–1916), the {{founding}} proprietor, was a Prussian-born American hotelier and self-made millionaire who influenced {{the development of}} the urban hotel as a civic social center and luxury destination. His motto was [...] "the guest is always right", and he became a wealthy and prominent figure internationally. The hotel was built to his specifications. He served as president and director of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel Company, as well as the Waldorf–Astoria Segar Company and the Waldorf Importation Company. He also owned and operated the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, an elite boutique hotel on Broad Street in Philadelphia, with his wife, Louise. Boldt was described as [...] "Mild mannered, undignified, unassuming", resembling [...] "a typical German professor with his close-cropped beard which he kept fastidiously trimmed... and his <b>pince-nez</b> glasses on a black silk cord". Boldt retained his contacts with the European elite and he and his wife made frequent trips to Europe, bringing back with them many antiques, a characteristic of the Waldorf Astoria. Boldt continued to own the Bellevue even after his relationship with the Astors blossomed.|$|E
500|$|Head VI {{was first}} {{exhibited}} in November 1949 at the Hanover Gallery in London, in a showing organised {{by one of}} the artist's early champions, Erica Brausen. At the time, Bacon was a highly controversial but respected artist, best known for his 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, which made him the enfant terrible of British art. Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics; John Russell, later Bacon's biographer, at the time dismissed it as a cross between [...] "an alligator shorn of its jaws and an accountant in <b>pince-nez</b> who has come to a bad end". In 1989 Lawrence Gowing wrote that the [...] "shock of the picture, when it was seen with a whole series of heads... was indescribable. It was everything unpardonable. The paradoxical appearance at once of pastiche and iconoclasm was indeed one of Bacon's most original strokes." [...] Art critic and curator David Sylvester described it as a seminal piece from Bacon's unusually productive 1949–50 period, and one of Bacon's finest popes.|$|E
500|$|Pedro II {{was also}} {{undergoing}} physical decline, which {{only served to}} exacerbate his mental state. In younger days, he was admired {{for his ability to}} work long hours and rapidly bounce back from setbacks. But [...] "lack of exercise and very poor eating habits also took their toll." [...] By the 1880s he had to rely on <b>pince-nez</b> spectacles for reading due to deterioration of his eyesight, and on dentures for eating, as sugar had caused his teeth to decay. A tendency to doze off unexpectedly began to be exhibited, including falling asleep [...] "in the middle of important meetings and during public engagements." [...] The cause was what is known today as type 2 diabetes (non-insulin-dependent), with which the Emperor was diagnosed sometime around 1882. Throughout the following years, the monarch was afflicted with several sudden illnesses, ranging from stomach pains to fevers. In 1884 he received a laceration on his left leg which became infected and, complicated by his diabetes, took longer than expected to completely heal. He also began suffering from [...] "urinary problems due to the damage done by diabetes to his kidneys." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} hotel {{started as}} two hotels on Fifth Avenue built by feuding relatives. The first hotel, the 13-story, 450-room Waldorf Hotel, designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh in the German Renaissance style, was opened on March 13, 1893 {{at the corner}} of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street, on the site where millionaire developer William Waldorf Astor had his mansion. The original hotel stood [...] high, with a frontage of about [...] on Fifth Avenue, with an area of [...] The original hotel was described as having a [...] "lofty stone and brick exterior", which was [...] "animated by an effusion of balconies, alcoves, arcades, and loggias beneath a tile roof bedecked with gables and turrets". William Astor, motivated in part by a dispute with his aunt Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, had built the Waldorf Hotel next door to her house, on the site of his father's mansion. The hotel was built to the specifications of founding proprietor George Boldt, who owned and operated the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, a fashionable hotel on Broad Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with his wife Louise. Boldt was described as [...] "Mild mannered, undignified, unassuming", resembling [...] "a typical German professor with his close-cropped beard which he kept fastidiously trimmed... and his <b>pince-nez</b> glasses on a black silk cord". Boldt continued to own the Bellevue even after his relationship with the Astors blossomed.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, Vera Constantinova {{appeared}} small and dumpy with a fat, round face. She wore her hair very short, which gave her a masculine look. [...] Extremely nearsighted, she wore a <b>pince-nez.</b> She was considered rather eccentric, but she had {{a good sense of humor}} and her funny remarks were remembered by her nephews and nieces. She was well liked by her family.|$|E
2500|$|Quevedo's father, Francisco Gómez de Quevedo, was {{secretary}} to Maria of Spain, daughter of emperor Charles V and wife of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, and his mother, Madrid-born María de Santibáñez, was lady-in-waiting to the queen. Quevedo matured surrounded by dignitaries and nobility {{at the royal}} court. Intellectually gifted, Quevedo was physically handicapped with a club foot, and myopia. Since he always wore <b>pince-nez,</b> {{his name in the}} plural, quevedos, came to mean [...] "pince-nez" [...] in the Spanish language.|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, Boulanger {{returned}} to the US for a longer tour. She had arranged to give a series of lectures at Radcliffe, Harvard, Wellesley and the Longy School of Music, and to broadcast for NBC. During this tour, {{she became the first}} woman to conduct the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In her three months there, she gave over a hundred lecture-recitals, recitals and concerts These included the world premiere of Stravinsky's Dumbarton Oaks Concerto. [...] At that time she was seen by American sculptor Katharine Lane Weems who recorded in her diary, “Her voice is surprisingly deep. She is quite slim with an excellent figure and fine features, Her skin is delicate, her hair graying slightly, she wears <b>pince-nez</b> and gesticulates as she becomes excited talking about music.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Over time, the {{construction}} of frames for glasses also evolved. Early eyepieces were designed to be either {{held in place by}} hand or by exerting pressure on the nose (<b>pince-nez).</b> Girolamo Savonarola suggested that eyepieces could be held in place by a ribbon passed over the wearer's head, this in turn secured by the weight of a hat. The modern style of glasses, held by temples passing over the ears, was developed some time before 1727, possibly by the British optician Edward Scarlett. These designs were not immediately successful, however, and various styles with attached handles such as [...] "scissors-glasses" [...] and lorgnettes were also fashionable from {{the second half of the}} 18th century and into the early 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Bear is an {{accomplished}} writer, notably {{as the author}} of several children's books, including So Many Whales, The Mayor of Banana Town, the [...] "Oscar" [...] series (including Oscar, Whose Pants Grew Too Small), and — during a somewhat later and darker period — Janet, The Girlfriend Who Could Only Ever Complain and Chug-A-Lug, The Train Who Drank. [...] He wears <b>pince-nez</b> and is most often attired in an elegant dressing gown. Mr. Bear originally lived on Roxx Street in Cambridge. As his parents were English, Cornelius absorbed British mannerisms as he grew up in the United States. Mr. Bear now lives at 62 Achewood Ct. In 2004, Pat shot Mr. Bear, who survived. Cornelius has been seen driving an Austin Mini with a Laphroaig tap on the dashboard. The driver's seat is on the right-hand side, indicating it was originally sold in Britain. He also owned (and presumably played) a French horn, though Ray wound up stepping on it by mistake.|$|E
