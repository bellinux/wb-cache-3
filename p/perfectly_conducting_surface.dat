40|$|The {{original}} {{intent of the}} reported investigation {{was to find a}} solution to the composite surface scattering problem which provided for a continuous transition between the near-specular physical optics and wide-angle tilted plane Bragg solutions. The employed approach is based on analytical techniques rather than physical considerations. The analysis employs a perturbation technique developed by Burrows (1967, 1968, 1973), which because of its simplicity, {{is the key to the}} entire solution. The analysis is restricted to the case of backscattering from a <b>perfectly</b> <b>conducting</b> <b>surface.</b> General expressions are presented for the scattering from a Gaussian <b>perfectly</b> <b>conducting</b> <b>surface</b> characterized by an anisotropic spectrum and possessing many scales of roughness.

40|$|The {{polarization}} {{of the electromagnetic}} vacuum is examined {{in the neighborhood of}} dielectric and <b>conducting</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the energy associated with this polarization is shown to depend on a cutoff related to the microstructure of the boundary. The appearance of the cutoff permits the vacuum energy to be expressed in terms of a surface tension and certain higher shape tensions. For the case of a dielectric boundary the surface tension reproduces the Schmitt-Lucas formula which accounts reasonably for the observed surface tensions of many materials. The curvature tension is also calculated and it seems the effect of this energy may well be accessible to experimental verification. For the case of <b>perfectly</b> <b>conducting</b> <b>surfaces</b> the first four shape tensions are calculated. It is shown that previous calculations of the vacuum energy due to <b>perfectly</b> <b>conducting</b> <b>surfaces</b> are in error and these errors are corrected. © 1982...|$|R

40|$|A planar <b>perfectly</b> <b>conducting</b> <b>surface</b> {{does not}} support a surface {{electromagnetic}} wave. However, a structured <b>perfectly</b> <b>conducting</b> <b>surface</b> can support such a wave. By means of a Rayleigh equation for the electric field in the vacuum above the two-dimensional rough surface of a semi-infinite perfect conductor we calculate the dispersion relation for surface electromagnetic waves on both a doubly periodic and a randomly rough surface. In the former case, if the periodic surface modulation is weak, the dispersion relation possesses a single branch within the non-radiative region of frequency and wave vector values. In {{the case of a}} randomly rough surface, in the small roughness approximation, the binding of the surface wave to the surface is weak, but nonzero. Thus, periodically or randomly structured perfectly conducting surfaces constitute a new type of optical metamaterial. The implications of these results for the analysis of experimental results for the propagation of surface plasmon polaritons on metal surfaces in the far infrared frequency range are discussed...|$|E

40|$|A large {{variety of}} {{simulation}} tools for calculating scattered fields {{have been published}} in literature. Basically, there are two main approaches, the so-called numerically exact or fullwave solutions, e. g. using Method of Moments (MoM), and the high-frequency or asymptotic solutions, e. g. using rays for modeling propagation paths. However, most of these simulation tools are limited to <b>perfectly</b> <b>conducting</b> <b>surfaces</b> or homogeneous dielectric bodies.

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that there is}} no unique {{definition}} of magnetic field line motion with or without <b>perfectly</b> <b>conducting</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Rather, an infinite set of velocity fields exists, each of which can properly be said to describe the motion of magnetic field lines. This set includes, but is not limited to, all possible bounce-averaged motions of charged particles. The supposed discrepancy between the observations of Lezniak and Winckler (1970) and those of Vasyliunas (1968) on plasma sheet motion during substorms is only apparent and illustrates the use of different definitions of field line motion in the same physical situation...|$|R
