40|$|Echinacea is {{a native}} of North America and {{traditionally}} used to combat cold, flu, cough, sore throats and many other ailments. Today, echinacea is among the most frequently utilized medicinal herbs around the world included in supplements and personal care formulations. The consumption of echinacea has signifi-cantly increased in Europe and North America, with a market share of about 10 % of the herbal industry in the United States (Rawls 1996). In Russia, E. purpurea tops are mixed with animal feeds to improve the natural resistance of cattle to diseases, and improve milk production its quality. Numerous attempts have been under-way in some non-traditional Echinacea growing countries, in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East to introduce cultivation, processing, and marketing. Today, E. purpurea in the markets originates solely from cultivation, while E. angustifolia, E. pallida, E. paradoxa, E. tenneseensis, and E. sanguinea raw materi-als are sourced either from <b>partial</b> <b>cultivation</b> or totally collected from the wild. Investigations of the pharmacological and biological activities of purported echinacea extracts have fre-quently shown them to be of widely differing character, with products obtained from either adulterated or misidentified species. With the evolution of botanical products, there has been an increasing demand for correctly identified herbal products that originate from cultivation. However, there has been little information on the influence of selected cultivars, various agronomic practices, and the geographical origin of the ra...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: European {{blueberry}} (E. blueberry; Vaccinium myrtillus L.) is {{a natural}} resource demanded by the processing industry with potential of domestication. Therefore {{an investigation of the}} possibilities of <b>partial</b> <b>cultivation</b> of native stands was started. OBJECTIVE: To increase knowledge of how E. blueberry react to soil types, climate, mineral nutrition, organic amendments and cutting of tillers. METHODE: Five forest fields with E. blueberry stands in Norway were examined. Besides natural development influenced by soil parameters and climate, effect of fertilization and plant pruning were examined in the municipalities of Bardu in Troms county (68 ◦N) and of Sn°asa and Lierne in Nord-Trøndelag county (64 ◦N). Experiments were executed in randomized block designs in forest fields of native E. blueberry stands. RESULTS: The fields that performed best had O-layers close to 7 cm or thicker. The C/N ratios indicate that N was not easily available in any field, and addition of mineral fertilizer containing nitrogen and phosphor show that especially N increased elongation of long shoots and more nodes were developed. However, the effect on number of short shoots per long shoot initiated a growth gain only the last of two years. The positive growth effect of fertilizer was not followed by higher yields throughout the years, and strongest fertilization level (N 60 P 40) reduced yield in average of four years. Adding composted wood chips or wood chips alone increased tiller growth in the birch-field in Bardu both years, but only the first year in the pine-field; this was not reflected in higher yield. Cutting of shoots to the ground reduced yield and full yield potential was not recovered before the third year after cutting. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that by improving growth conditions, especially by securing a thick natural O-layer and adjusting soil macro nutrient composition, growth conditions could be improved; and that fruit yield were down the two first years after pruning...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{droughts}} {{in southern}} Africa have noticed some {{appreciation of the}} role that <b>partial</b> wetland <b>cultivation</b> can play to address household food security. This has also witnessed some indication of possible relaxation of wetland cultivation restrictive policies in Zimbabwe. However, the general perceptions of society towards wetland cultivation remain unclear and critically important for policy crafting before blanket recommendations are made. Using a Binary Logistic Regression Model seven predictor independent variables were regressed against a binary dependent variable of wetland cultivation status of households with the implicit goal of estimating socio-economic factors capable of influencing households` participation in wetland cultivation. Results revealed that from the seven predictor variables, six variables had a significant influence, while one variable was not significant. The implied message centres on careful articulation of such a policy given the fact that, the dominant age group (young and educated household heads) had a negative attitude towards wetland cultivation, a crucial factor that may risk its rejection if put under a referendum. Intuitively results conjecture a bleak future for <b>partial</b> wetland <b>cultivation</b> as a possible land use because the expected future generation (current young and educated household heads) currently shares a negative attitude towards <b>partial</b> wetland <b>cultivation.</b> Wetland Cultivation, Environmental Policy, Logistic Regression, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|Wetlands are {{stocks of}} natural {{resources}} limited in supply, {{in the middle of}} unlimited human wants with multiple uses to society, presenting an economic problem in as far as their rational and sustainable use is concerned. To that end, conflicting recommendations have been forwarded regarding wetland cultivation as a possible land use across the globe and from within the same regions. On one extreme, wetland cultivation has been linked to degradation of wetlands with pure wetland conservation as the prescribed viable and sustainable land use option to society. Closer to reality, partial wetland conversion to crop land has been found compatible with wetland bio-diversity; implying that <b>partial</b> wetland <b>cultivation</b> is the prescribed wetland use option viable and sustainable to societies, a dictum mainly claimed by rural communities. With that conflicting background and based on the “Safe Minimum Standard” approach, a ban on wetland cultivation was maintained in several early environmental policies in Zimbabwe as a basis for legislative protection of wetlands, a position that is still legally binding in current statutes. Contrary to that, rural communities have responded by invading wetlands as a coping strategy in pursuit of the claimed values of wetland cultivation, further conflicting with standing policies. This scenario has managed to “lock” and is currently locking the claimed 1, 28 million hectares of wetlands in Zimbabwe in a “legal-operational impasse”, at a cost to the entire nation since no meaningful investment is possible in wetlands when there is a legal conflict...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{paper is}} {{composed}} of two parts; The first surveys the changes in Nigerian national food production with relation to the governmental policy. The second analyses the findings from a field study about local food production in relation with that of the national level. Nigerian food production began to increase in the mid- 1980 s, however there is no substan-tial data to convince it. To what extent this was due to the Structural Adjustment Program (S. A. P.) is assessed using the methodology of political ecology. This paper is an attempt to show how and to what extent the change in agricultural production in national level has con-nected with that of local level. It’s highly probable that introduction of S. A. P. has effect to increase food production, through extensive changes in cultivation, such as diminution of mixed cropping, shortened fallow periods, and <b>partial</b> desolation of <b>cultivation</b> fallow systems. These all lead to the increase in cassava production, which may have been attained at the ultimate sacrifice of land degradation...|$|R
60|$|My {{room was}} clean--oppressively clean. I quite longed {{to see a}} little dust somewhere. My library was limited to the Bible and the Prayer-Book. My view from the window showed me a dead flat in a <b>partial</b> state of <b>cultivation,</b> fading sadly from view in the waning light. Above the head of my spruce white bed hung a scroll, bearing a damnatory {{quotation}} from Scripture in emblazoned letters of red and black. The dismal presence of Miss Meadowcroft had passed over my bedroom, and had blighted it. My spirits sank as I looked round me. Supper-time was still an event in the future. I lighted the candles and took from my portmanteau what I firmly believe to have been the first French novel ever produced at Morwick Farm. It was one of the masterly and charming stories of Dumas the elder. In five minutes I was in a new world, and my melancholy room was full of the liveliest French company. The sound of an imperative and uncompromising bell recalled me in due time to the regions of reality. I looked at my watch. Nine o'clock.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 188 {{carbohydrate}} polymer-producing bacterial strains were isolated from recycled sludge of five seafood processing plants. Among three selected isolates, identified as Enterobacter cloacae WD 7, Enterobacter agglomerans WD 50 and Pseudomonas alcaligenes WD 22. E. cloacae WD 7 generated a viscous culture broth exhibiting the highest flocculating activity and a crude polymer yield of 2. 27 g/L after 3 days <b>cultivation.</b> <b>Partial</b> purification of this polymer {{was performed by}} precipitation with 95 % ethanol, dialysis and freeze-drying. It was characterized as an acidic heteropolysaccharide, composed of neutral sugars (29. 4 %), uronic acids (14. 2 %) and amino sugars (0. 93 %). The functional group analysis by FT-IR spectroscopy showed the presence of hydroxyl, carboxyl, carbonyl and methoxyl groups. Thermal analysis by DSC showed the crystalline transition and the crystalline melting point (T-m) at 300 degrees C. This polysaccharide was soluble in water and insoluble in any organic solvents tested; gelation occurred under alkaline conditions {{in the presence of}} divalent cations in which copper as CuSO 4 gave the best result. Studies on the flocculation property revealed that this polysaccharide was stable at 4 - 60 degrees C and pH 5 - 7. The optimal concentrations for the flocculating activity were 2 mg/L polysaccharide and 40 mM CaCl 2 which played the synergistic effect on kaolin flocculation. Moreover, this polysaccharide could flocculate the kaolin suspension over a wide range of pH (pH 2 - 8) and temperature (4 - 50 degrees C) tested in the presence of CaCl 2. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
