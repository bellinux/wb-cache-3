5|$|The {{number of}} {{orphaned}} children in Malawi {{has increased dramatically}} since the HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1985, with certain surveys indicating that more than 35% of schoolchildren have experienced the death {{of at least one}} parent due to HIV/AIDS.

Older children who have lost both <b>parents</b> <b>to</b> HIV/AIDS often become responsible for the care of their younger siblings, and many double orphans drop out of school or migrate to urban areas to try to support themselves and their siblings.

5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster <b>parents</b> <b>to</b> adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E
