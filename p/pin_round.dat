6000|$|... 'But nothing did the Mother {{forward with}} more eagerness, by every opportunity, than the {{kindling}} inclination of her Son {{to become a}} Preacher; which even showed itself in his sports. Mother or Sister had {{to put a little}} cowl on his head, and <b>pin</b> <b>round</b> him by way of surplice a bit of black apron; then would he mount a chair and begin earnestly to preach; ranging together in his own way, not without some traces of coherency, all that he had retained from teaching and church-visiting in this kind, and interweaving it with verses of songs. The Mother, who listened attentively and with silent joy, put a higher meaning into this childish play; and, in thought, saw her Son already stand in the Pulpit, and work, rich in blessings, in a spiritual office. The spiritual profession was at that time greatly esteemed, and gave promise of an honourable existence. Add to this, that the course of studies settled for young Würtemberg Theologians not only offered important pecuniary furtherances and advantages, but also morally the fewest dangers. And thus the prudent and withal pious Father, too, saw no reason to object to this inclination of the Son and wish of the Mother.|$|E
60|$|As she spoke, Miss Ellen set the two pins in {{the middle}} of the red satin cushion, stuck the smaller <b>pins</b> <b>round</b> them, and hastened to put on her shawl lest {{something}} should prevent her from going.|$|R
60|$|They had {{all turned}} {{mechanically}} {{into the room}} where the Leightons were sitting when the Woodburns rang: Mr. Woodburn consented to sit down, and he remained listening to Mrs. Leighton while his daughter bustled up to the sketches <b>pinned</b> <b>round</b> the room and questioned Alma about them.|$|R
60|$|Giving {{her message}} in those terms, the woman {{produced}} {{from the pocket}} of her apron Lady Janet's second letter to Mercy, with a strip of paper oddly <b>pinned</b> <b>round</b> the envelope. Mercy detached the paper, and found on the inner side some lines in pencil, hurriedly written in Lady Janet's hand. They ran thus.|$|R
50|$|This problem (of {{the lace}} {{needing to be}} longer than the pillow) is solved in a {{different}} way by the roller pillow, which has a small roller, for working the lace, set into a larger area, where the bobbins are laid. This means that the pattern can be <b>pinned</b> <b>round</b> the roller, but the pillow has a flat bottom.|$|R
50|$|The matron's badge or brèid is a gentlewoman's headdress worn in the Scottish Highlands {{in former}} times. It {{consists}} of a square of fine linen, <b>pinned</b> <b>round</b> the head, fastened with cords of silk or gold. The matron's badge was donned by a woman the morning after her marriage, and was regarded as the badge of wifehood.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is she indeed?" [...] asked Marian, solemnly, {{thinking}} {{probably that}} her new friend's experience in ghosts must be extensive. However that might be, {{he thought that}} as far as his experience in women went, he had never seen anything more lovely than Madeline Staveley dressed in a long white sheet, with a long bit of white cambric <b>pinned</b> <b>round</b> her face.|$|R
60|$|I {{turned my}} head, {{and saw the}} profile {{of a man who was}} leaning over the parapet beside me. It was a refined face, not unhandsome, though pinched and pale enough, and the coat collar turned up and <b>pinned</b> <b>round</b> the throat marked his status in life as sharply as a uniform. I felt I was {{committed}} to the price of a bed and breakfast if I answered him.|$|R
6000|$|Cousin Stephen, {{you will}} never be a saint. Isle of saints. You were awfully holy, weren't you? You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have a red nose. You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet street. O si, certo! Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags <b>pinned</b> <b>round</b> a squaw. More tell me, more still!! On the top of the Howth tram alone crying to the rain: Naked women! naked women! What about that, eh? ...|$|R
60|$|He sat by {{the fire}} in the kitchen, not daring to speak for happiness. Till that moment he had not known how {{beautiful}} and peaceful life could be. The green square of paper <b>pinned</b> <b>round</b> the lamp cast down a tender shade. On the dresser was a plate of sausages and white pudding and on the shelf there were eggs. They would be for the breakfast in the morning after the communion in the college chapel. White pudding and eggs and sausages and cups of tea. How simple and beautiful was life after all! And life lay all before him.|$|R

50|$|An early type of pillow {{can be seen}} in The Lace-Maker by Caspar Netscher. The pillow has {{a wooden}} frame, and is {{slightly}} sloping. The lace-maker rests it on her lap. The bolster or cylindrical pillow was much cheaper to make as it is just a fabric bag stuffed with straw. It was used in Bedfordshire lace. It needs a stand as it does not have a flat bottom. Usually the bolster had the pattern <b>pinned</b> <b>round</b> the cylinder, so by turning the pillow, the lace could be as long as was needed. However, Maltese lacemakers used the pillow the other way. They had a long thin pillow, which they rested against something. Then they worked the lace {{down the length of the}} pillow.|$|R

50|$|In Tenerife lace, the wheel-like motifs {{are made}} separately. The thread is first taken to-and-fro across the fabric-covered {{circular}} cards or blocks around <b>pins</b> stuck <b>round</b> the edge. Once these radial threads {{are in place}} the pattern is woven in with a needle. The finished motif is released by removing the pins and the motifs are later sewn together.|$|R

25|$|The plug {{defined in}} SI 32 (IS16A-R) is used only in Israel {{and in the}} territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. There are two versions: an older one with flat pins, and a newer one with <b>round</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{belaying}} pin {{is composed of}} a round handle and cylindrical shaft. The shaft is inserted into a hole in various strategically located wooden pinrails (lining {{the inside of the}} bulwarks, surrounding the base of masts, or free-standing, called fife rails) up {{to the base of the}} handle. A line is then led under and behind the base of the <b>pin</b> then <b>round</b> the top in a Figure-8 pattern till at least four turns are complete.|$|R
5000|$|By {{virtue of}} the SCARA's parallel-axis joint layout, the arm is {{slightly}} compliant in the X-Y direction but rigid in the 'Z' direction, hence the term: Selective Compliant. This is advantageous for many types of assembly operations, i.e., inserting a <b>round</b> <b>pin</b> in a <b>round</b> hole without binding. The second attribute of the SCARA is the jointed two-link arm layout similar to our human arms, hence the often-used term, Articulated. This feature allows the arm to extend into confined areas and then retract or [...] "fold up" [...] out of the way. This is advantageous for transferring parts from one cell to another or for loading/ unloading process stations that are enclosed.|$|R

6000|$|He {{sank back}} a huddled heap upon the chair. There was foam about his mouth, great {{beads of sweat}} upon his forehead. Mary wiped them away with a corner of her apron, and felt again his {{trembling}} hands. [...] "Oh, please don't talk to him any more," [...] she pleaded, [...] "not till he's had his supper." [...] She fetched her fine shawl, and <b>pinned</b> it <b>round</b> him. His eyes followed her as she hovered about him. For the first time, since he had entered the room, they looked human.|$|R
