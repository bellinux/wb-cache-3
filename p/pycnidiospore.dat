40|$|International audienceThe fungus Leptosphaeria maculans causes {{blackleg}} (phoma stem canker), one of {{the most}} serious diseases of oilseed rape. The role of <b>pycnidiospores</b> produced during asexual reproduction is poorly documented and limits the understanding of the pathogen's population dynamics. The objectives of this study were to assess rain-splash dispersal of <b>pycnidiospores</b> of L. maculans from phoma leaf spots, and transmission of the disease from oilseed rape stubble carrying pycnidia. The work was conducted in still air with either a drop generator or a rain simulator. The impact of simulated incident drops on phoma leaf spots resulted in the dispersal of L. maculans <b>pycnidiospores</b> within splash droplets. Ninety per cent of the spores were collected within 14 cm of the source and a few were regularly observed up to 40 cm. <b>Pycnidiospores</b> produced on oilseed rape stubble and dispersed by simulated rain infected oilseed rape trap plants in a spatial pattern that matched the spatial dispersal of the <b>pycnidiospores.</b> In the field, rain-splash dispersal of <b>pycnidiospores</b> could increase the pathogen population and may enhance sexual reproduction by facilitating the mating of initially spatially separated isolates of opposite mating type...|$|R

40|$|The {{abundance}} of Zymoseptoria tritici ascospores and conidia {{in a field}} was examined throughout two one-year periods (1998 - 1999 and 1999 - 2000) establishing the relationship between spore release and weather variables. Radiation, temperature, intensity of rainfall, and relative humidity significantly affected the dispersal of ascospores and <b>pycnidiospores</b> of this pathogen. Spore traps collected both types of spores, at weekly intervals, at two different stages of the wheat crop (vegetative and wheat stubble stages) and different distances from the sources. Ascospores were the predominant sources of inoculum in the field. The numbers of ascospores and <b>pycnidiospores</b> declined {{with the increase of}} distance from the sources. The release of <b>pycnidiospores</b> was associated with the increase in rainfall intensity 7 days before the released event and the increase in radiation 60 days before the same event.

The fungus produced pycnidia containing α-conidia on active cankers from fall to mid spring. No β-conidia were found under natural conditions, but many isolates produced β-conidia intermixed with α-conidia in culture. Only α-conidia germinated on agar medium.

Gene expression and transcriptional enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion analyses of Sch 1 indicates strong expression during asexual development. Mutant strains of Stagonospora nodorum lacking Sch 1 demonstrated poor growth on minimal media and exhibited a significant reduction in asexual sporulation on all growth media examined.

40|$|Zymoseptoria tritici ascospores and pycnidiospores are {{considered}} the main forms of primary and secondary inoculum, respectively, in septoria tritici blotch epidemics. The pathogenicity of {{the two types of}} spores of the same genotypic origin were compared through a two-stage inoculation procedure in controlled conditions. Adult wheat leaves were inoculated with ascospores collected from field sources, yielding 119 lesions; pycnidiospores collected from 12 lesions resulting from these ascospore infections were then used for inoculation. Lesion development was assessed for 5 weeks; latent period, lesion size, and pycnidium density were estimated for different isolates. The latent period was calculated as the maximum likely time elapsed between inoculation and either the appearance {{of the majority of the}} sporulating lesions (leaf scale) or the appearance of the first pycnidia (lesion scale). The latent period was significantly longer (c. 60 degree-days, i. e. 3 - 4 days) after infection with ascospores than with pycnidiospores. No difference was established for lesion size and density of pycnidia. A comparison with other ascomycete fungi suggested that the difference in latent period might be related to the volume of spores and their ability to cause infection. Fungal growth before the appearance of lesions may be slower after inoculation with an ascospore than with a <b>pycnidiospore.</b> The mean latent period during the very beginning of epidemics, when first lesions are mainly caused by ascospores, may be longer than during spring, when secondary infections are caused by pycnidiospores.

40|$|Management {{strategies}} of Septoria leaf blotch {{could be improved}} by a better characterization of the onset and early stages of epidemics. The inoculum build-up and overseasoning potentially involve various fungal structures (ascospores, <b>pycnidiospores,</b> mycelium) and plant material (wheat seeds, stubble and debris; wheat volunteers; other grasses). Among the mechanisms reportedly involved in disease establishment and year-to-year disease transmission, infection by ascospores, wind-dispersed from either distant or local infected wheat debris, is considered as the most significant. Nevertheless, infection by <b>pycnidiospores,</b> splash-dispersed either from neighbouring wheat debris or from senescent basal leaves, has also been inferred from indirect evidence. The contribution of wheat debris to {{the early stages of}} Septoria leaf blotch epidemics and the relative importance of different types of inoculum to the establishment of Mycosphaerella graminicola were assessed in a three-year, field experiment conducted in the Paris Basin, a main wheat producing area in France. Three options of debris management (chopped debris, removed debris followed by tillage, tillage in absence of debris) were tested, which had a strong effect, although transient, on the early epidemic dynamic: the more debris present on the soil surface, the more severe initial disease was. The relative production of <b>pycnidiospores</b> and ascospores was measured on the chopped debris. Autumn conditions, characterized by moderate temperature with alternating wet and dry periods, were favorable for the production of ascospores and <b>pycnidiospores,</b> which concomitantly peaked in October-November; thus both types of spores can be involved as primary inoculum in North-West European conditions. During the winter period, the decrease in primary inoculum delayed disease progress; later on, disease progress resumed because of the input of inoculum from remote origin (ascospores). Management of wheat debris at the plot scale cannot be expected to decrease final disease severity and yield loss, although it can reduce the local amount of primary inoculum. Such a decrease, however, is likely to be obtained by limiting inoculum on a larger scale, considering that local inoculum sources in a given plot will also act as inoculum sources for distant plots...|$|R

The tested debris management options (chopped debris, removal of debris followed by tillage, or tillage in absence of debris) had a strong effect, although transient, on the epidemic dynamic: the more debris present on the soil surface, the more severe initial disease was. The magnitude of differences between treatments differed substantially between years. The relative production of pycnidiospores and ascospores was measured on the chopped debris. Peaks in <b>pycnidiospore</b> and ascospore production coincided in October-November. Both types of spores can be involved as primary inoculum in north-west European conditions. The local amount of pycnidiospores available on debris in the field, estimated per square metre, was 1000 -fold the local ascospore production. Moreover, inoculum production was quantified on debris exposed to different environmental conditions. Autumnal conditions, characterized by moderate temperature with alternating wet and dry periods, were favourable for the production of both pycnidiospores and ascospores, as shown by the high inoculum production on debris exposed to field or outdoor conditions. By late autumn, the canopy became the most important source of pycnidiospores, and this period, characterized by the decreasing role of debris as a local source of inoculum compared to distant potential sources, can be considered as the end of the early epidemic stages...|$|E

Variability of 20 Algerian isolates of M. pinodes representative of four agro climatic regions were investigated {{on the basis of}} cultural, morphological and pathogenicity. Culture and morphology showed variations in colony color, radial growth pattern and production of pycnidia and pycnidiospores. Significant differences (P < 0. 05) in both pycnidia and pycnidiospores size among isolates were observed. Hence, the size of pycnidia and pycnidiospores of M. pinodes varied from 145 x 143 mu m to 280 x 265 mu m and from 11. 5 x 2. 3 mu m to 22. 5 x 6. 3 mu m respectively.

Phoma koolunga {{is a relatively new}} pathogen of this complex disease in Australian field pea crops. This thesis reports information about aspects of the epidemiology of this fungus in Australian conditions. The survival of P. koolunga on field pea stubble and as pseudosclerotia buried in field soil was examined. The frequency of recovery of this fungus declined over time and it was not recovered from stubble buried in soil or placed on the soil surface in pots outdoors at months 11 and 15, respectively, and later. Pseudosclerotia were produced in Petri dishes containing potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with fluorocytocin or with sand. The maximum longevity of pseudosclerotia buried in soil in pots outdoors was less than 18 months. Infectivity of inoculum of the fungus decreased over time, as the mean number of lesions on plants inoculated with stubble buried or left on the soil surface for up to 6 and 5 months, respectively, and pseudosclerotia retrieved at 14 months and later from field soil did not differ from the water control in a pot bioassay. P. koolunga was isolated from field pea seed samples harvested from South Australia and Victoria. Disease was transmitted to 98 % of seedlings that emerged from artificially inoculated seeds (AIS) in growth room conditions. Seedling emergence rate from AIS at 8 ° C soil temperature was lower than at 12, 16 and 20 ° C and also disease severity on seedlings was greater at the lower temperature. Efficacy of fungicides as seed dressings was examined on AIS. P-Pickel T® and Jockey Stayer® were the most effective fungicides among six tested for reducing disease incidence and severity due to P. koolunga on seedlings that emerged from AIS sown in soil and on germination paper, respectively. The reaction of 12 field pea genotypes to one moderately virulent isolate of P. koolunga was evaluated by spraying a <b>pycnidiospore</b> suspension on plants in controlled conditions and assessing disease severity at 2 - 5 day intervals for 21 days. Sturt, Morgan and Parafield showed more severe disease on leaves than the other genotypes at 21 days post-inoculation (dpi), and Kaspa, PBA Twilight, PBA Oura, PBA Wharton and WAPEA 2211 were less susceptible. When three isolates of P. koolunga which varied in virulence were sprayed on four genotypes of short, semi-leafless type peas, Morgan and WAPEA 2211 showed more disease than Kaspa at 21 dpi. Aggressiveness of isolates of P. koolunga on these four genotypes differed based on % leaf area diseased up to 14 dpi, but this difference had disappeared by 21 dpi. Some isolates of P. koolunga from seeds showed atypical morphology and reproductive behaviour. These cultures had rhizoid form mycelia on growth media such as PDA. Also, some atypical cultures of P. koolunga sectored from typical colonies on PDA. These sectors and cultures were confirmed as P. koolunga by DNA test using P. koolunga-specific primers. Mycelium from these sectors produced small lesions on leaves and stems of field pea seedling resembling ascochyta blight symptoms in controlled conditions. Pycnidium-like structures of these atypical cultures did not contain pycnidiospores, but had many round and hyaline fatty guttulae of different sizes, usually smaller than normal spores of P. koolunga which never germinated. Crossing 19 isolates of P. koolunga in vitro failed to initiate formation of pseudothecia of P. koolunga on pea stem pieces or on several growth media. This fungus might need specific environmental conditions for production of pseudothecia which still are unknown. The results of this study provide information about survival of P. koolunga, transmission to seedlings via infected seed, control of the fungus in seed and also reaction of field pea genotypes to this pathogen in South Australian conditions. These findings improve the understanding of epidemiology of this disease and consequently can help to improve management of this pathogen in the field. Thesis (Ph. D.)

50|$|Ascochyta blight of pea {{is caused}} by Ascomycete fugi. This fungus has an {{anamorphic}} (asexual) stage and a telemorphic (sexual) stage. Ascochyta fungal pathogens are heterothallic, meaning they require two compatible hyphae strains to form their sexual stage. Pycnidia of Ascochyta spp. can overwinter in soil, seeds, or infected plant debris. They release <b>pycnidiospores</b> that {{come into contact with}} host tissue and germinate- as the primary inoculum- penetrating through stomatal openings in the Spring. Lesions soon become visible on the leaves. Next, the fungal hyphae grows and produces pear-shaped pycnidia, eventually releasing <b>pycnidiospores</b> that can reinfect plants or seeds via rain splashes- these are considered the secondary inoculum. Compatible hyphae may also fuse to form dikaryotic mycelium, that produce asci-bearing pseudothecia. These can also overwinter in infected plant debris and release their ascospores in the spring to infect new hosts as primary inoculum via wind. The presence of two mating types contributes to genetic variation via recombination. This has helped the pathogen to create outbreaks in previously resistant varieties of plants. Usually, Ascochyta species are host specific: A. fabae, A. lentis, A. pisi, and A. viciae-villosae infect the faba bean, lentil, pea, and hairy vetch respectively. That is, each species only causes symptoms on their respective hosts and not on another. The pea died.|$|R

40|$|Stagonospora nodorum is a necrotrophic fungal {{pathogen}} that is {{the causal}} agent of leaf and glume blotch on wheat. S. nodorum is a polycyclic pathogen, whereby rain-splashed <b>pycnidiospores</b> attach to and colonise wheat tissue and subsequently sporulate again within 2 - 3 weeks. As several cycles of infection are needed for a damaging infection, asexual sporulation is a critical phase of its infection cycle. A non-targeted metabolomics screen for sporulation-associated metabolites identified that trehalose accumulated significantly in concert with asexual sporulation both in vitro and in planta. A reverse-genetics approach was used to investigate the role of trehalose in asexual sporulation. Trehalose biosynthesis was disrupted by deletion of the gene Tps 1, encoding a trehalose 6 -phosphate synthase, resulting in almost total loss of trehalose during in vitro growth and in planta. In addition, lesion development and pycnidia formation were also significantly reduced in tps 1 mutants. Reintroduction of the Tps 1 gene restored trehalose biosynthesis, pathogenicity and sporulation to wild-type levels. Microscopic examination of tps 1 infected wheat leaves showed that pycnidial formation often halted {{at an early stage}} of development. Further examination of the tps 1 phenotype revealed that tps 1 <b>pycnidiospores</b> exhibited a reduced germination rate while under heat stress, and tps 1 mutants had a reduced growth rate while under oxidative stress. This study confirms a link between trehalose biosynthesis and pathogen fitness in S. nodorum...|$|R
