Focusing attention on university education in prison {{takes the form of}} a particularly useful analytical and critical exercise because it <b>permits</b> <b>questioning</b> <b>the</b> distance between prison and society, stereotypes of the prisoner and stereotypes of prison, for example. Furthermore, it allows capturing the transformative effects of “knowledge practices” on the individual and on the system, beyond any rhetoric of treatment...|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} entrenchment {{would be the}} entrenching of {{portions}} of the Malaysian Constitution related to the Malaysian social contract, which specifies that citizenship be granted to the substantial Chinese and Indian immigrant populations {{in return for the}} recognition of a special position for the indigenous Malay majority. The Constitution did not initially contain an entrenched clause; indeed, one of the articles later entrenched, Article 153, was initially intended to be subject to a sunset clause. However, after the May 13 incident of racial rioting in 1969, Parliament passed the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1971. <b>The</b> Act <b>permitted</b> criminalisation of <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> of Articles 152, 153, 181, and Part III of the Constitution.|$|R
50|$|Article 10 (4) of <b>the</b> Constitution <b>permits</b> <b>the</b> {{government}} to ban <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> of Article 153, {{and thus the}} social contract; indeed, the Sedition Act does illegalise such <b>questioning.</b> <b>The</b> Internal Security Act (ISA) also <b>permits</b> <b>the</b> {{government to}} detain anybody it desires for practically an indefinite period of time, and many, including politicians from the DAP such as Lim Kit Siang and Karpal Singh have been held under the ISA; {{it is widely believed}} this was because of their vehement criticism of Malay privileges.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study male <b>questioning</b> of masculinity. <b>The</b> study of <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> will be {{conducted}} through a literature study, that will be done using an anthology that holds a critical perspective towards masculinity. The study of <b>the</b> <b>questioning,</b> will be done through mapping the most common patterns within <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> together with patterns in the form used for presenting <b>the</b> <b>questioning.</b> Apart from <b>the</b> focus on <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> and its form, which norms that are being questioned will also be studied. Apart from the focuses mentioned above, the last focus is directed towards finding patterns within the chosen themes vulnerability and homosociality. Since the focuses of the thesis will be studied through finding patterns within the material, thematic analysis {{will be used as}} a method. The method queer reading will also be used for studying norms. What has been found is that the form of <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> mainly contains alternative thinking and reflections about ideals, as well as frustration related to trying to live up to these ideals. Overall few innovatory perspectives were brought up in <b>the</b> <b>questioning,</b> but <b>the</b> own father was rather commonly brought up in relation to reflection of the own masculinity. Regarding the chosen themes, avoiding to express emotions of vulnerability openly was found to be most common regarding vulnerability. Within the theme of homosociality, the most common pattern was that the men maintained a distance to each other. The most interesting discovery was found within the reflective form, which became interesting, since the stories contained an understanding that reflection should be avoided in order to uphold a masculine identity. Paradoxically then, the overall form of the material was reflective stories, making the form of the stories a break against a central norm found within their content...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Questioning {{is one of}} the {{essential}} techniques used by lecturers to make lectures more interactive and effective. This study surveyed <b>the</b> perception of <b>questioning</b> techniques by medical school faculty members and analyzed how <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> technique is used in actual classes. Methods Data on the perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> skills used during lectures was collected using a self‒questionnaire for faculty members (N[*]=[*] 33) during the second semester of 2008. The questionnaire consisted of 18 items covering the awareness and characteristics of questioning skills. Recorded video tapes were used to observe <b>the</b> faculty members’ <b>questioning</b> skills. Results Most faculty members regarded <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> technique during classes as being important and expected positive outcomes in terms of the students’ participation in class, concentration in class and understanding of the class contents. In the 99 classes analyzed, the median number of questions per class was 1 (0 – 29). Among them, 40 classes (40. 4 [*]%) did not use <b>questioning</b> techniques. <b>The</b> frequency of <b>questioning</b> per lecture was similar regardless of the faculty members’ perception. On the other hand, the faculty members perceived that their usual wait time after question was approximately 10 seconds compared to only 2. 5 seconds measured from video analysis. More lecture‒experienced faculty members tended to ask more questions in class. Conclusions There were some discrepancies regarding <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> technique between <b>the</b> faculty members’ perceptions and reality, even though they had positive opinions of <b>the</b> technique. <b>The</b> <b>questioning</b> skills during a lecture need to be emphasized to faculty members. </p...|$|R
