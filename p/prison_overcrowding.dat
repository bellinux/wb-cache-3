5|$|In 1931, {{an attempt}} to force Stroud to {{discontinue}} his business {{and get rid of}} his birds failed after Stroud and one of his mail correspondents, a bird researcher from Indiana named Della Mae Jones, made his story known to newspapers and magazines. A massive letter campaign and a 50,000-signature petition sent to President Herbert Hoover resulted in Stroud being permitted to keep his birds, and despite <b>prison</b> <b>overcrowding,</b> he was even given a second cell to house them. However, his letter-writing privileges were greatly curtailed. Jones and Stroud grew so close that she moved to Kansas in 1931, and started a business with him, selling his avian medicines.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{current study}} aims to {{identify}} legal and extralegal factors that might influence judges’ penal decision in criminal cases. It the same time, {{it intends to}} determine how the imposed penalties effect on <b>prisons</b> <b>overcrowding,</b> on ensuring public safety protection, as well as on solving related problems faced by offenders. Our study showed that judges perceive the decision process as being mainly based on a rational approach, minimizing or even denying an external influence from extralegal factors, while being interested in accessing personal data like offender's personality, psychosocial identity, education or economic status. Hence, our study may represents a starting point for exploring the mechanism underlying judicial decision, as a prerequisite for improving sentence's predictability...|$|R

25|$|Many {{prisons in}} the United States are overcrowded. For example, California's 33 prisons {{have a total}} {{capacity}} of 100,000, but they hold 170,000 inmates. Many prisons in California {{and around the country}} are forced to turn old gymnasiums and classrooms into huge bunkhouses for inmates. They do this by placing hundreds of bunk beds next to one another, in these gyms, without any type of barriers to keep inmates separated. In California, the inadequate security engendered by this situation, coupled with insufficient staffing levels, have led to increased violence and a prison health system that causes one death a week. This situation has led the courts to order California to release 27% of the current prison population, citing the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The three-judge court considering requests by the Plata v. Schwarzenegger and Coleman v. Schwarzenegger courts found California's prisons have become criminogenic as a result of <b>prison</b> <b>overcrowding.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2014, archaeological work in {{the former}} prison grounds led to the {{discovery}} of three rare panopticons (named after Jeremy Bentham’s prison design of 1791) located near the A and B Divisions that were built of bluestone in the 1850s. The first uncovered and excavated was to the north of A division and was built of bluestone in the 1850s. The circular design, with walls coming out from the centre, created wedge shaped 'airing yards' where prisoners would be permitted access for one hour per day without coming into contact with each other. The panopticons fell out of use, due to <b>prison</b> <b>overcrowding,</b> and were largely demolished in the early 1900s. The panopticons were based on the design concepts of British philosopher and social reformer Jeremy Bentham. The footings of the first panopticon that was excavated and uncovered is located to the north of A Division and remains relatively intact. The excavation and uncovering of the other two panopticons next to B Division only revealed the remains of its rubble footings.|$|E
