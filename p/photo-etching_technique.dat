40|$|The LaFeO 3 nano-crystalline {{thin-film}} of perovskite-type composite-oxides {{is obtained}} {{by using a}} sol-gel coating technique, and the <b>photo-etching</b> <b>technique</b> is employed to etch and pattern the film. Combining this thin-film technology with the NMOS integrated circuit technology, we have developed an ethanol-sensitive field-effect transistor by using a LaFeO 3 nano-crystalline thin-film as a gate electrode of an ordinary n-channel MOSFET. The sensor has excellent selectivity, good sensitivity to ethanol, and a good stability. In order to improve the recovery transient of the sensor, the LaFeO 3 doped with strontium ions has been investigated. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Adaptive phased arrays are {{versatile}} sensors which adjust themselves automatically and electronically to meet particular constraints. Such a constraint {{might be}} to minimise the level of interference or to enhance the desired signals or both simultaneously. This enhanced system performance. These arrays have received considerable attention and development in many applications such as broadcasting, radar and communications. The core of this adaptive phased array system is the phased array. In this thesis, a digitally controlled microstrip phased array is discussed and built. This phased array consists of three parts: firstly, eight stripline 3 -bit-PIN diodes-controlled hybrid ring coupled phase shifters, secondly, an equi-spaced half-wavelenth linear array of 8 square microstrip patch antennas and lastly, a stripline 8 -way hybrid ring reactive corporate feed. A simple <b>photo-etching</b> <b>technique</b> was used to fabricate the phase shifters, the array and the feed on teflon fibreglass substrate. The individual parts of the phased array was tested and found to perform well. Finally, the antenna main lobe of the phased array was successfully steered by manual control of the phase shifters and thus proved its capability for a fully adaptive phased array system...|$|E
40|$|Microbjects with {{dimensions}} from 1 μm to 1 mm {{have been}} developed recently for different aspects and purposes. Consequently, the development of handling and manipulation tools to fulfil this need is urgently required. Micromanipulation techniques could be generally categorized according to their actuation method such as electrostatic, thermal, shape memory alloy, piezoelectric, magnetic, and fluidic actuation. Each of which has its advantage and disadvantage. The fluidic actuation has been overlooked in MEMS despite its satisfactory output in the micro-scale. This thesis presents different families of pneumatically driven, low cost, compatible with biological environment, scalable, and controllable microgrippers. The first family demonstrated a polymeric microgripper that was laser cut and actuated pneumatically. It was tested to manipulate microparticles down to 200 microns. To overcome the assembly challenges that arise in this family, the second family was proposed. The second family was a micro-cantilever based microgripper, where the device was assembled layer by layer to form a 3 D structure. The microcantilevers were fabricated using <b>photo-etching</b> <b>technique,</b> and demonstrated the applicability to manipulate micro-particles down to 200 microns using automated pick-and-place procedure. In addition, this family {{was used as a}} tactile-detector as well. Due to the angular gripping scheme followed by the above mentioned families, gripping smaller objects becomes a challenging task. A third family following a parallel gripping scheme was proposed allowing the gripping of smaller objects to be visible. It comprises a compliant structure microgripper actuated pneumatically and fabricated using picosecond laser technology, and demonstrated the capability of gripping microobject as small as 100 μm microbeads. An FEA modelling was employed to validate the experimental and analytical results, and excellent matching was achieved...|$|E
40|$|Some novel quasi-planar chiral inclusions, {{feasible}} {{from standard}} <b>photo-etching</b> <b>techniques,</b> are proposed. It is shown that such inclusions {{can be designed}} in order to present balanced electric, magnetic and magneto-electric polarizabilities. Using these inclusions, random and periodic bi-isotropic artificial metamaterials exhibiting a balanced positive/negative refractive index can be build up. These metamaterials would exhibit reasonable bandwidths and excellent matching to free space. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures, Metamaterials 2007, Rome 22 - 24 October 200...|$|R
40|$|This letter {{proposes a}} quasi-planar chiral {{resonator}} {{suitable for the}} design of negative refractive index matamaterial. It is presented an analytical model for the determination of its polarizabilities, and the viability of negative refraction in chiral and racemic arrangements with the proposed inclusions is analyzed. The present analysis is expected to pave the way to the design of negative refractive index matamaterials made of a single kind of inclusions feasible from standard <b>photo-etching</b> <b>techniques.</b> Comment: Submitted to Applied Physics Letter...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{method for}} the fast {{creation}} of antenna and Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) prototypes is discussed. The method is suited for printed structures on planar and singly curved surfaces and avoids {{the use of}} <b>photo-etching</b> <b>techniques.</b> Furthermore, it allows for creating printed metallic structures on non-microwave-specific substrates. The method uses adhesive copper tape, common adhesive tape, a paper stencil, a ruler and a knife. The construction technique is first applied for creating a test structure, {{to be used with}} Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) measurements to determine the substrate's relative permittivity and loss tangent. The substrate characterization technique is discussed in detail and an example of the use is demonstrated. The prototyping technique is discussed in detail and practical hints are provided. Finally the construction of a micro strip array antenna and a RF energy harvesting FSS are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Walker began {{teaching}} at the Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles in 1966. His interest in creative photographic processes {{brought him to the}} attention of Robert Heinecken and Robert W. Fichter at UCLA, and the three co-taught classes for a brief time. In 1970 Walker accepted a one-year teaching position at the University of Florida. There he worked with photographers Jerry Uelsmann and Douglas Prince as well as printmaker Ken Kerslake, who was at that time using <b>photo-etching</b> <b>techniques</b> in intaglio printmaking. Walker taught a photo-printmaking class and a silkscreen class. In an interview in the late 1970s Walker said, [...] "The contact with the ideas of the printmaker have greatly altered my attitudes toward photography, and how each discipline deals with an image." [...] Seven years later he moved to Tucson and taught at the University of Arizona before retiring in 1985.|$|R
40|$|These {{etchings}} are {{the result}} of research of many aesthetic possibilities that are available to the contemporary printmaker. After working in the traditional printmaking methods for many years, this effort was a challenge and a search for a new imagery. Each new experiment seemed to lead to different methods of resolving the content and in several of the prints, a new form evolved, - an inter-media print with a three dimensional quality. The scrolls and pattern cut-outs added this new dimension to my prints. This series of etchings involve multiple plates and photo-etching. Some prints include collographs with the zinc and <b>photo-etched</b> plates. The <b>techniques</b> and imagery are the culmination of five semesters of work. The <b>technique</b> of <b>photo-etching</b> and learning by hours of research, took one semester. The final prints were selected after many months of printing the plates, using different colored inkings and sequences of printing, i. e., printing wet on wet ink, or drying the print before super-imposing the next plate. Some of these colored multiple plate etchings involve as many as six printings. The "Reflections" are of Hawaii and my impressions of how I feel and remember the beauty and tranquility of the islands. I remember the gentle trade winds that created enchanting patterns with the tropical growth. The interplay of light and shadow, the glistening rain drops after a sudden shower. The fusion of color and form of the flowers of every description. The dazzling tropical fish and sea urchins reflected in the lava-rock tide pools. These are some of the impressions that influenced this series of prints. (See more in text. ...|$|R
