25|$|Even before 1 January 2000 arrived, {{there were}} also some worries about 9 September 1999 (albeit less than those {{generated}} by Y2K). Because this date could also be written in the numeric format 9/9/99, it could have conflicted with the date value 9999, frequently used to specify an unknown date. It was thus possible that database programs might act on the records containing unknown dates on that day. Data entry operators commonly entered 9999 into required fields for an unknown future date, (e.g., a termination date for cable television or telephone service), in order to <b>process</b> <b>computer</b> forms using CICS software. Somewhat similar to this is the end-of-file code 9999, used in older programming languages. While fears arose that some programs might unexpectedly terminate on that date, the bug {{was more likely to}} confuse computer operators than machines.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a versatile test facility developed by AECL for validation and reliability (V&R) testing of safety-critical software {{used in the}} <b>process</b> trip <b>computers</b> for CANDU 1 reactors. It describes the hardware and software aspects of the test facility. The test hardware consists of a test rig with a test computer used for executing the test software and a <b>process</b> trip <b>computer</b> emulator. The test software is comprised of an operating system, a test interpreter, a test oracle, and a man-machine interface. This paper also discusses {{the application of the}} test facility in V&R testing of the <b>process</b> trip <b>computer,</b> how test scripts are prepared and automatically run on the test computer, and how test results are automatically generated by the test computer, thus eliminating potential human errors. The test scripts, which contain specific instructions for testing, are text files written in a special AECL test language. An AECL Test Language Interpreter (ATLIN) program interprets the test scripts and translates structured English statements in the test scripts into test actions. The intuitive nature of the special AECL test language, the version controlled test scripts in text format and automatic test logging feature facilitate the preparation of test cases, which are easy to repeat, review and readily modifiable, and production of consistent results. This paper presents the concept of adding a <b>process</b> trip <b>computer</b> emulator for use in preparation of V&R testing. The <b>process</b> trip <b>computer</b> emulator is designed independently from the actual <b>process</b> trip <b>computer</b> but based on the same functional specification as for the <b>process</b> trip <b>computer.</b> The use of the <b>process</b> trip <b>computer</b> emulator allows the test scripts to be exercised before the actual <b>process</b> trip <b>computers</b> are 1 CANDU is a registered trade-mark of Atomic Energy of Canada Limite...|$|R
