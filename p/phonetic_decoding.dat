50|$|In {{the past}} two decades, the phonological deficit {{hypothesis}} has been the dominant explanation favored by researchers as to the probable cause of dyslexia, {{but it is only}} one of several competing theories. Critics of the phonological hypothesis point out that it fails to account for symptoms of dyslexia unrelated to <b>phonetic</b> <b>decoding</b> difficulties, such as problems with short-term memory, visual processing issues, or difficulties with balance and small motor coordination that are common to many dyslexic children and adults. They also argue that much of the evidence for the theory is based on circular reasoning, in that phonological weakness is seen as both a defining symptom of dyslexia and as its underlying cause.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{teaching}} is geared to remediating {{specific areas of}} weakness, such as addressing difficulties with <b>phonetic</b> <b>decoding</b> by providing phonics-based tutoring. Some {{teaching is}} geared to specific reading skill areas, such as phonetic decoding; whereas other approaches are more comprehensive in scope, combining techniques to address basic skills along with strategies to improve comprehension and literary appreciation. Many programs are multisensory in design, meaning that instruction includes visual, auditory, and kinesthetic or tactile elements; as it is generally believed that such forms of instruction are more effective for dyslexic learners. [...] Despite claims of some programs to be [...] "research based", {{there is very little}} empirical or quantitative research supporting the use of any particular approach to reading instruction as compared to another when used with dyslexic children.|$|E

40|$|A {{major problem}} in connectionist <b>phonetic</b> {{acoustic}} <b>decoding</b> {{is the way to}} present acoustic signal to the network. Neurobiological data about the inner ear and the primary auditory cortex can be very helpful but are rare. On the other hand, other biological works have shown that structure and functioning of the visual cortex, which have been extensively studied, are very close to the structure and functioning of the auditory cortex. It has been shown that a simple two-layered network of linear neurons can organize itself to extract the complete information contained in a set of presented patterns. This model has been applied to visual information and has revealed orientation and spatial frequency selective cells. Such principles have been applied to speech recognition. So we have designed two kinds of maps. The first kind is able to represent frequency characteristics of the signal (e. g. : formantic structure).

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} recent {{developments}} on the HMMbased acoustic-to-articulatory inversion approach that we develop for a "visual articulatory feedback" system. In this approach, multi-stream phoneme HMMs are trained jointly on synchronous streams of acoustic and articulatory data, acquired by electromagnetic articulography (EMA). Acousticto- articulatory inversion is achieved in two steps. <b>Phonetic</b> and state <b>decoding</b> is first performed. Then articulatory trajectories are inferred from the decoded phone and state sequence using the maximum-likelihood parameter generation algorithm (MLPG). We introduce here a new procedure for the reestimation of the HMM parameters, {{based on the}} Minimum Generation Error criterion (MGE).

40|$|This {{chapter is}} devoted to memory {{as one of the}} most {{important}} assets of a consecutive interpreter. First, it presents the most influencial models of memory, which divide memory generally into sensory, working and long-term memory. Then, applications of various memory types in consecutive interpreting are described: short-term auditory memory in <b>decoding</b> <b>phonetic</b> stimuli, phonological loop in processing complex sentences and long words, visuo-spatial sketchpad in visualisations, semantic long-term memory in tapping into background knowledge and episodic memory when working with previously interpreted speakers. Studies of memory involving interpreters and trainees are briefly reviewed to show that memory training is useful as part of interpreter training. This is followed by a range of exercises involving visualisations to show students if and to what extent imagery can be helpful to them in processing and remembering information when interpreting consecutively.

40|$|As {{a result}} of migratory {{movements}} in recent decades, {{an increasing number of}} children are educated in a language which is not their mother tongue. For these children, learning to read takes place in their second language. This learning context is made unique by two challenges. First, the learning of the written code occurs simultaneously with the learning of the oral language. Second, no reference to the written code of the maternal language is made available to these children. This particular learning context can lead to inequity between the second language learner and his or her unilingual peers in terms of <b>phonetic</b> encoding and <b>decoding.</b> Furthermore, the limited vocabulary of a beginning language learner can impede the direct lexical access used when learning to read. Fourteen students were evaluated for their metalinguistical abilities, lexical and phonic knowledge. Following these tests, an analysis was conducted of student reading errors made in a real reading context. This descriptive study explores the interaction between reading strategies used by second language learners: bottom-up (word comprehension derived from the context of the text) and top-down (text comprehension derived from word recognition).

40|$|Fluent {{reading is}} {{characterized}} by speed and accuracy in the decoding and comprehension of connected text. Although a variety of measures are available {{for the assessment of}} reading skills most tests do not evaluate rate of text recognition as reflected in fluent reading. Here we evaluate FastaReada, a customized computer generated task that was developed to address some of the limitations of currently available measures of reading skills. FastaReada provides a rapid assessment of reading fluency quantified as words read per minute for connected, meaningful text. To test the criterion validity of FastaReada, 124 mainstream school children with typical sensory, mental and motor development were assessed. Performance on FastaReada was correlated with the established Neale Analysis of Reading Ability (NARA) measures of text reading accuracy, rate and comprehension, and common single word measures of pseudoword (non-word) reading, <b>phonetic</b> <b>decoding,</b> phonological awareness (PA) and mode of word decoding (i. e., visual or eidetic versus auditory or phonetic). The results demonstrated strong positive correlations between FastaReada performance and NARA reading rate (r = 0. 75), accuracy (r = 0. 83) and comprehension (r = 0. 63) scores providing evidence for criterion-related validity. Additional evidence for criterion validity was demonstrated through strong positive correlations between FastaReada and both single word eidetic (r = 0. 81) and <b>phonetic</b> <b>decoding</b> skills (r = 0. 68). The results also demonstrated FastaReada to be a stronger predictor of eidetic decoding than the NARA rate measure, with FastaReada predicting 14. 4 % of the variance compared to 2. 6 % predicted by NARA rate. FastaReada was therefore deemed to be a valid tool for educators, clinicians, and research related assessment of reading accuracy and rate. As expected, analysis with hierarchical regressions also highlighted the closer relationship of fluent reading to rapid visual word recognition than to phonological-based skills. Eidetic decoding was the strongest predictor of FastaReada performance (16. 8 %) followed by <b>phonetic</b> <b>decoding</b> skill (1. 7 %).

While all good decoders had good phonological awareness, not all those with good phonological awareness were good decoders.

This expert system transforms a vocal signal into a phonetic lattice. The higher level of the system takes care of the recognition of the lattice thus obtained by deferring it in the form of written sentences (orthographical Form).

Results: A path analysis indicated that kindergarten measures of phonological awareness and letter identification provided information to the prediction of 2 nd-grade reading. In 2 nd grade, measures of reading offered information to the prediction of 4 th-grade reading. Additionally, a reciprocal relationship was found between phonological awareness and word reading, with kindergarten phonological awareness predicting 2 nd-grade word reading and, conversely, 2 nd-grade word reading predicting 4 th-grade phonological awareness. Clinical Implications: Phonological awareness assessment provides information about reading in kindergarten but loses its predictive power at 2 nd grade.
