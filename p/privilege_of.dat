5|$|The <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> {{access is}} no longer exercised, but it is {{possibly}} still retained by peers whether members of the House of Lords or not.

5|$|The <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> peerage {{extends to}} all {{temporal}} peers and peeresses {{regardless of their}} position {{in relation to the}} House of Lords. The right to sit in the House is separate from the privilege, and is held by only some peers (see History of reform of the House of Lords). Scottish peers from the Acts of Union 1707 and Irish peers from the Act of Union 1800, therefore, have the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> peerage. From 1800, Irish peers have had the right to stand for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons but they lose the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> peerage for the duration of their service in the lower House. Since 1999, hereditary peers of England, Scotland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom who are not members of the House of Lords may stand for election to the House of Commons. Their <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> peerage is not explicitly lost by service in the lower House. Any peer issuing a disclaimer under the provisions of the Peerage Act 1963 loses all privileges of peerage. The <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> peerage also extends to wives and widows of peers. A peeress by marriage loses the privilege upon marrying a commoner, but a peeress suo jure does not. Individuals who hold courtesy titles, however, do not have such privileges by virtue of those titles. Lords Spiritual (the 26 Archbishops and Bishops who sit in the House of Lords) do not have the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> peerage as, at least since 1621, they have been Lords of Parliament, and not peers.|$|E

5|$|The <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> peerage is {{the body}} of special {{privileges}} belonging {{to members of the}} British peerage.

5|$|The <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> {{trial by}} peers was still ill-defined, and the statute did not cover peeresses.

He succeeded in getting the consent and necessary financial contributions of the estates in a landtag decree of 26 July 1653. In turn, he confirmed several privileges of the knights, including tax exemption, assertion of jurisdiction and police powers on their estates (Patrimonialgerichtsbarkeit) and the upholding of serfdom (Leibeigenschaft, Bauernlegen).|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Louis I, Poland formed a Polish-Hungarian union. In the pact of 1374 (the <b>Privilege</b> <b>of</b> Koszyce), the Polish nobility was granted {{extensive}} concessions and agreed to extend the Anjou succession to Louis's daughters, as Louis had no sons. Louis's neglect of Polish affairs resulted {{in the loss of}} Casimir's territorial gains, including Halych Rus', which was recovered by Queen Jadwiga in 1387. In 1396, Jadwiga and her husband Jagiełło (Jogaila) forcefully annexed the central Polish lands separating Lesser Poland from Greater Poland, previously granted by King Louis to his Silesian Piast ally Duke Władysław of Opole.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh was {{formally}} {{established as a}} royal burgh by King David I of Scotland around 1125. This gave the town the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> holding a market, {{and the ability to}} raise money by taxing goods coming into the burgh for sale. It is probable, therefore, that some form of boundary was constructed around this time, although {{it may have been a}} timber palisade or ditch, rather than a stone wall.|$|E

Among other officials, present were the NSDAP-Kreisleiter (county leader) Helmut Böhme and the mayor of Meissen, Walter Kaule. Philipp was granted the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> signing the Meissen Golden Book (Goldenes Buch)—a book signed in German communities and cities by special guests of honor.|$|E

5|$|Louis and {{the representatives}} of the Polish nobility started {{negotiations}} of Louis's succession in Poland in the autumn of 1373. After a year of negotiations, he issued the so-called <b>Privilege</b> <b>of</b> Koszyce on 17 September 1374, reducing the tax that Polish noblemen paid to the king by about 84% and promising a remuneration to noblemen who participated in foreign military campaigns. In exchange, the Polish lords confirmed the right of Louis's daughters to inherit Poland.|$|E
