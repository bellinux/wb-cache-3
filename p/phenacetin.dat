5|$|Salicylate medicines—including salicin, {{salicylic}} acid, {{and sodium}} salicylate— were difficult and wasteful to extract from plants, and in 1860 Hermann Kolbe {{worked out a}} way to synthesize salicylic acid. Throughout the late 1800s use of salicylates grew considerably, and physicians increasingly knew what to expect from these medicines: reduction of pain, fever, and inflammation. However, the unpleasant side effects, particularly gastric irritation, limited their usefulness, as did their intense bitterness. By the 1880s, the German chemical industry, jump-started by the lucrative development of dyes from coal tar, was branching out to investigate the potential of new tar-derived medicines. The turning point was the advent of Kalle & Company's Antifebrine, the branded version of the well-known dye derivative acetanilide—the fever-reducing properties of which were discovered by accident in 1886. Antifebrine's success inspired Carl Duisberg, the head of research at the small dye firm Friedrich Bayer & Company, to start a systematic search for other chemical fever-reducers. Bayer chemists soon developed <b>Phenacetin,</b> followed by the sedatives Sulfonal and Trional.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, Spühler and Zollinger {{reported}} {{an association between}} kidney injury and the chronic use of <b>phenacetin.</b> They noted that chronic users of <b>phenacetin</b> had {{an increased risk of}} developing specific kidney injuries, namely renal papillary necrosis and chronic interstitial nephritis. This condition was dubbed analgesic nephropathy and was attributed to <b>phenacetin,</b> although no absolute causative role was demonstrated. With further reports of the increased risk of kidney injury with prolonged and excessive <b>phenacetin</b> use, however, <b>phenacetin</b> was banned in several countries between the 1960s and 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Analgesics are a {{class of}} {{medications}} widely used {{in the treatment of}} pain. They include aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as well as the antipyretics paracetamol (known as acetaminophen in the United States) and <b>phenacetin.</b> Introduced in the late 19th century, <b>phenacetin</b> was once a common component of mixed analgesics in parts of Europe, Australia, and the United States. These combined analgesics contained aspirin or other NSAID with <b>phenacetin,</b> paracetamol, or salicylamide, and caffeine or codeine.|$|E
25|$|Analgesic {{nephropathy}} is {{injury to}} the kidneys caused by analgesic medications such as aspirin, <b>phenacetin,</b> and paracetamol. The term usually refers to damage induced by excessive use of combinations of these medications, especially combinations that include <b>phenacetin.</b> It may {{also be used to}} describe kidney injury from any single analgesic medication.|$|E
25|$|How <b>phenacetin</b> {{and other}} analgesics lead to this damage is incompletely understood. It is {{currently}} {{thought that the}} kidney toxicities of NSAIDs and the antipyretics <b>phenacetin</b> and paracetamol may combine to give rise to analgesic nephropathy. A committee of investigators reported in 2000 that there was insufficient {{evidence to suggest that}} non-phenacetin analgesics by themselves are associated with analgesic nephropathy.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} how <b>phenacetin</b> induces injury to the kidney. Bach and Hardy have {{proposed}} that phenacetin's metabolites lead to lipid peroxidation that damages cells of the kidney.|$|E
25|$|Most healthy kidneys contain enough {{physiologic}} {{reserve to}} compensate for this NSAID-induced decrease in blood flow. However, those subjected to additional injury from <b>phenacetin</b> or paracetamol may progress to analgesic nephropathy.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{traditionally}} {{based on the}} clinical findings above in combination with excessive analgesic use. It is estimated that between 2 and 3kg each of <b>phenacetin</b> or aspirin must be consumed before evidence of analgesic nephropathy becomes clinically apparent.|$|E
25|$|Analgesic {{nephropathy}} {{was once}} a common cause of kidney injury and end-stage kidney disease in parts of Europe, Australia, and the United States. In most areas, its incidence has declined sharply since the use of <b>phenacetin</b> fell in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The term {{analgesic}} nephropathy usually refers to damage induced by {{excessive use of}} combinations of these medications, specifically combinations that include <b>phenacetin.</b> For this reason, it is also called analgesic abuse nephropathy. Murray prefers the less judgmental analgesic-associated nephropathy. Both terms are abbreviated to the acronym AAN, by which the condition is also commonly known.|$|E
25|$|Paracetamol is {{the major}} {{metabolite}} of <b>phenacetin</b> and may contribute to kidney injury through a specific mechanism. In cells of the kidney, cyclooxygenases catalyse the conversion of paracetamol into N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI). NAPQI depletes glutathione via non-enzymatic conjugation with glutathione, a naturally occurring antioxidant. With depletion of glutathione, cells of the kidney become particularly sensitive to oxidative damage.|$|E
25|$|Codeine is also {{commonly}} marketed {{in products}} containing codeine with other pain killers or muscle relaxers, {{as well as}} codeine mixed with <b>phenacetin</b> (Emprazil with codeine No. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), naproxen, indomethacin, diclofenac, and others, {{as well as more}} complex mixtures, including such mixtures as aspirin + paracetamol + codeine ± caffeine ± antihistamines and other agents, such as those mentioned above.|$|E
25|$|As {{the use of}} <b>phenacetin</b> declined, so too did the {{prevalence}} of analgesic nephropathy {{as a cause of}} end-stage kidney disease. Data from Switzerland, for example, demonstrated a decline in {{the prevalence}} of analgesic nephropathy among people with end-stage kidney disease, from 28% in 1981 to 12% in 1990. An autopsy study performed in Switzerland suggested that the prevalence of analgesic nephropathy in the general population has likewise decreased; the prevalence was 3% in 1980 and 0.2% in 2000.|$|E
25|$|The {{occasional}} {{reports of}} acetanilide-induced cyanosis prompted {{the search for}} supposedly less toxic aniline derivatives, such as <b>phenacetin.</b> After several conflicting results over the ensuing fifty years, it was ultimately established in 1948 that acetanilide was mostly metabolized to paracetamol (known in the United States as USAN: acetaminophen) in the human body, {{and that it was}} this metabolite that was responsible for its analgesic and antipyretic properties. Acetanilide is no longer used as a drug in its own right, although the success of its metabolite – paracetamol (acetaminophen) – is well known.|$|E
25|$|While {{these data}} {{demonstrate}} that analgesic nephropathy {{has been all}} but eliminated in some regions, in other regions the condition persists. Notably, in Belgium, the prevalence of analgesic nephropathy among people having dialysis was 17.9% in 1984 and 15.6% in 1990. Michielsen and de Schepper suggest that analgesic nephropathy persists among people in Belgium having dialysis not due to non-phenacetin analgesics, but because Belgium accepts {{a higher proportion of}} elderly people for dialysis. According to these authors, a greater proportion have analgesic nephropathy because a greater percentage of people in Belgium having dialysis have been exposed to long-term use of <b>phenacetin.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} portion of Toole's {{military}} career {{one of his}} primary motivations for advancement was to acquire a private office. Privacy was a significant luxury on the island {{with some of the}} men renting rooms in nearby hotels so they could have some solitude. Toole's army buddy David Kubach, also an aspiring writer, lent him a green Swedish-made Halda typewriter for use in his office. The barracks consisted solely of college educated English professors, which gave it a different makeup from usual army companies. In contrast to almost all other army barracks where gays kept their sexual orientation a secret, there was an openly gay contingent which flaunted their homosexuality. The gay men reserved a portion of the barracks for themselves and as they did not proposition any of the straight instructors, they were left alone. However, this particular group of gay men drank significantly more {{than the rest of the}} group and eventually began to exhibit a loud, rowdy, and vulgar brand of behavior that made the straight men uncomfortable. Toole's response was to ignore their behavior and it lost him the respect of some of the men in the barracks. The problem came to a head when a gay instructor attempted suicide by overdosing on APC (aspirin, <b>phenacetin,</b> and caffeine) tablets after being spurned by another soldier. When Toole found the man he waited a half-hour to call for help, hoping he would awaken on his own. His friend Kubach stated that this was because it would look bad for the soldier and that he would most likely get himself court martialed for a suicide attempt. Some of his fellow soldiers were livid and held a meeting deciding whether to report Toole's negligence. Ultimately, they did not report his behavior and the army never filed any charges but his relationships with many of the men were irrevocably changed.|$|E

50|$|Saridon {{was first}} {{launched}} by Roche in 1933, initially containing pyrithyldione and <b>phenacetin,</b> widely used remedies for fever and pain. It often contained aspirin, <b>phenacetin</b> and caffeine, but was reformulated in 1981, replacing the original ingredient <b>phenacetin</b> with paracetamol, before <b>phenacetin</b> was {{banned by the}} US FDA in 1983. It was available in more than 80 countries across Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, but has been discontinued in many of them.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phenacetin</b> {{was widely}} used until {{the third quarter}} of the twentieth century, often {{in the form of an}} [...] "A.P.C." [...] or aspirin-phenacetin-caffeine {{compound}} analgesic, as a remedy for fever and pain. An early formulation (1919) was Vincent's APC in Australia. However the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered the withdrawal of drugs containing <b>phenacetin</b> in November 1983, owing to its carcinogenic and kidney-damaging properties (Federal Register of October 5, 1983 (48 FR 45466)). It was also banned in India. As a result, some branded, previously phenacetin-based preparations continued to be sold, but with the <b>phenacetin</b> replaced by safer alternatives. A popular brand of <b>phenacetin</b> was Roche's Saridon, which was reformulated in 1983 to contain propyphenazone, paracetamol and caffeine. Coricidin was also reformulated without <b>phenacetin.</b> Paracetamol is a metabolite of <b>phenacetin</b> with similar analgesic and antipyretic effects, but the new formulation has not been found to have phenacetin's carcinogenicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenacetin,</b> and {{products}} containing <b>phenacetin,</b> {{have been shown}} in an animal model to have the side effect and after-effect of carcinogenesis. In humans, many case reports have implicated products containing <b>phenacetin</b> in urothelial neoplasms, especially urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis. In one prospective series, <b>phenacetin</b> was {{associated with an increased}} risk of death due to urologic or renal diseases, death due to cancers, and death due to cardiovascular diseases.In addition, people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may experience acute hemolysis, or dissolution of blood cells, while taking this drug. Acute hemolysis is possible in the case of patients who develop an IgM response to <b>phenacetin</b> leading to immune complexes that bind to erythrocytes in blood. The erythrocytes are then lysed when the complexes activate the complement system.|$|E

5000|$|Acetanilide was {{the first}} aniline {{derivative}} serendipitously found to possess analgesic as well as antipyretic properties, and was quickly introduced into medical practice {{under the name of}} Antifebrin by A. Cahn and P. Hepp in 1886. But its unacceptable toxic effects, the most alarming being cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia, prompted the search for less toxic aniline derivatives. Harmon Northrop Morse had already synthesised paracetamol at Johns Hopkins University via the reduction of p-nitrophenol with tin in glacial acetic acid in 1877, {{but it was not until}} 1887 that clinical pharmacologist Joseph von Mering tried paracetamol on humans. In 1893, von Mering published a paper reporting on the clinical results of paracetamol with <b>phenacetin,</b> another aniline derivative. Von Mering claimed that, unlike <b>phenacetin,</b> paracetamol had a slight tendency to produce methemoglobinemia. Paracetamol was then quickly discarded in favor of <b>phenacetin.</b> The sales of <b>phenacetin</b> established Bayer as a leading pharmaceutical company. Overshadowed in part by aspirin, introduced into medicine by Heinrich Dreser in 1899, <b>phenacetin</b> was popular for many decades, particularly in widely advertised over-the-counter [...] "headache mixtures", usually containing <b>phenacetin,</b> an aminopyrine derivative of aspirin, caffeine, and sometimes a barbiturate.|$|E
