40|$|According to the International Plant Protection Convention and theWorld Trade Organization Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures, {{any measure}} against the {{introduction}} and spread of new pests must be justified by a science-based <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis.</b> Economic impact <b>assessments</b> are usually carried out {{using a qualitative}} approach, based on classifying the size of impact into five categories, from “minimal” to “massive”. Whilst the qualitative approach may be adequate in many instances, it lacks transparency and demonstrable objectivity. A quantitative approach for economic impact assessment may improve transparency and strengthen the justification for measures, if taken, but requires additional work, and it requires specific data and models. This paper, first, compares {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Second, it clarifies the data and models needed to conduct a quantitative economic impact assessment to support a decision on the pest quarantine status or justify management measures. Third, it identifies the criteria for choosing the appropriate level of complexity, regarding the resolution, economic technique and time frame of the quantitative approach. The greater transparency and objectivity of the quantitative vis-a-vis qualitative economic impact assessment may enhance plant health policy and decision making at national and international regulatory bodies. However, uncertainties that are inherent to this approach may weaken this position. Hence, PRAs require a mixture of quantitative and qualitative approaches for assessing impacts and the exact balance of the two has to be case-specific...|$|R
40|$|International {{treaties}} {{require that}} phytosanitary measures against introduction and spread of invasive plant pests are justified by a science-based <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis,</b> including an <b>assessment</b> of potential economic consequences. This study evaluates the economic justification of the currently applied phytosanitary measures against {{potato spindle tuber viroid}} (PSTVd). It assesses {{the impact of}} an unregulated EU infestation, while accounting for uncertainty due to scarcity of data. Expert opinions were elicited to describe the possible range of PSTVd spread. Stochastic simulations, based on the assessments of separate experts, indicated that the direct impacts exceed the costs of current phytosanitary measures (€ 5. 6 M/year) with a probability of 44 %, but with large differences between experts making it hard to justify the measures solely by the expected savings in direct impacts. The direct impact on potato producers was estimated with partial budgeting. This impact is 2. 1 M€, based on an assumed prevalence of PSTVd of 0. 73 %, while the direct impact on tomato producers was estimated at 3. 5 M€. The total economic impact, considering price changes and higher costs for consumers, was estimated at 4. 4 M€ for potatoes and 5. 7 M€ for tomatoes. Consumers bore 92 % of the total costs of invasion in the case of potato and 77 % in the case of tomato. If the presence of PSTVd would imply export restrictions, resulting in an annual loss of more than 1 % of the total EU export value of potatoes and tomatoes, the cost of current phytosanitary measures would also be justified. The potential economic impacts of PSTVd into the European Union are therefore demonstrably of importance when considering market effects or export losses but questionable if only accounting for the direct losses. The large degree of uncertainty in the prevalence of disease contributes to the justifiability of measures based on the precautionary principle. The assessment approach can be useful for assessing the economic justification of phytosanitary measures...|$|R
50|$|IPPC standards, {{referred}} to as International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM), {{have been developed to}} assist NPPOs. The primary ISPMs relevant to <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> are ISPM 2, Framework for <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis,</b> ISPM 11, Pest <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> for quarantine <b>pests</b> and ISPM 21, Pest <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> for regulated non-quarantine pests. Although ISPMs relating to <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> provide guidance regarding the factors to consider when conducting analyses, they do not provide instructions as to how to actually perform a <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis.</b> However, many countries including Australia, New Zealand and the USA, have developed procedures to assess the <b>pest</b> <b>risks</b> associated with the import of plant commodities. Devorshak (2012) describes the principles of <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis,</b> how analyses can be performed and the use of <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> in regulatory plant protection. A general guide to the principles of <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> for plant <b>pests</b> and a description of some of the problems and difficulties that may be encountered when undertaking such analyses are included in text by Ebbels (2003) which also covers wider plant health issues.|$|R
50|$|The {{level of}} detail in a <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> will be limited by the amount and quality of {{information}} available, the tools, and time available before a decision is required. Quantitative and qualitative techniques are used in <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> but <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> need only be as complex as is required by the circumstances to support a phytosanitary decision and provide the necessary technical justification to defend decisions regarding phytosanitary measures. Nevertheless, a <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> {{should be based on}} sound science, be transparent and consistent with other <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> analyses conducted by the NPPO.|$|R
50|$|Within the {{initiation}} {{stage of a}} <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> the reason for conducting the analysis, {{the identity of the}} pest and or pathways being analysed and the area in relation to which the analysis is conducted (the <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> area) is provided.|$|R
50|$|Assessing the {{likelihood}} of pest entry requires assessment {{of each of the}} pathways with which a pest may be associated, from its origin to its establishment in the <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> area. In a <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> initiated by a specific pathway, often an imported commodity or goods associated with an imported commodity, e.g. packing materials, the probability of pest entry is evaluated for that specific pathway. For a <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> initiated for a specific pest, all probable pathways are evaluated for that individual pest.|$|R
50|$|Estimating the {{likelihood}} of pest introduction and of the consequences that could result involves many uncertainties. Uncertainty is always part of <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> analysis; very often {{there is a lack}} of data necessary to reach secure conclusions. The subjective nature of <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> is also a source of uncertainty. ISPM 11 recognises that <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> involves many uncertainties, largely since estimates and extrapolations are made from real situations where the pest occurs to a hypothetical situation in the <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> area. In most cases analyses performed during <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> use historical data to forecast potential future events. It is important to document the areas of uncertainty and the degree of uncertainty in the assessment, and to indicate where expert judgement has been used. This is necessary for transparency and may also be useful for identifying and prioritizing research needs.|$|R

50|$|Pest <b>risk</b> <b>analysis,</b> as {{conducted}} {{under the}} IPPC and SPS Agreement, has been criticised for being reactive, only {{coming into effect}} after a pest problem has been identified. For example, many pests now subject to phytosanitary measures, supported by <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis,</b> only became recognised as potential risks once they had already escaped from their geographical centres of origin and caused impacts {{in other parts of}} the world. Some ‘newly escaped’ organisms were previously unknown to science before they escaped and current international standards for <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> cannot assess <b>risks</b> from unknown organisms. In addition, a <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> will focus on a pest at the species level assuming the pest to be genetically stable but this can be a great oversimplification if the pest has a short generation time with capacity for rapid genetic change. During the assessment of impact, assessors focus on impacts on known hosts or habitats. However, if a pest adapts to a new host plant or habitat once established in the <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> area, impacts will be underestimated. Risk analyses for invasive species have also been criticised for being narrowly focused, subjective, often arbitrary and unquantified, and subject to political interference.|$|R

50|$|In {{accordance}} with the WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement the IPPC aims to protect plants while limiting interference with international trade. A key principle of the IPPC is that contracting parties (signatories) provide ‘technical justification’ to support phytosanitary decision making affecting trade. The IPPC recognises <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> as the appropriate format for such technical justification. The responsibility for conducting <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> sits within government, specifically within a country’s National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO) and comes as an obligation when countries become contracting parties to the IPPC (IPPC Article IV, 2a).|$|R
5000|$|In {{this step}} the {{potential}} impacts {{that could be}} expected to result from a pest’s introduction and spread is identified, described and, as much as possible, quantified. Pest impacts can take many forms; they may be economic [...] environmental or social impacts. Information on the species impacts in areas where it is already present, and particularly in areas where it has already spread to, together with information influencing the elements of <b>risk</b> in the <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> area, inform the assessment of potential consequences. Impacts reported from invaded areas are recognized as the best indicator of potential impacts in the <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> area [...] However, regarding environmental impacts, if the pest has not previously spread then the absence of any environmental impact in the area of pest origin should not be interpreted to mean that no environmental impact should be expected in the <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> area. This is because environmental impacts are difficult to predict and a lack of impact in the origin is not a good predictor {{that there will be no}} impacts in regions where a pest is introduced.|$|R
50|$|To {{estimate}} {{the likelihood of}} establishment of a pest, biological information about the pest including its life cycle, its hosts or habitat needs, or a diseases epidemiology, together with characteristics of the abiotic environment affecting pest survival such as temperature, precipitation and perhaps soil type affecting its geographic range limit need to be considered. The environmental conditions under which the pest does not survive are also important to understand. Conditions in the <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> area can then be compared with conditions {{in areas where the}} pest survives, and in areas where the pest is known {{not to be able to}} survive, so as to assess the likelihood that the pest will establish in the <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> area.

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Scientific Panel on Plant Heath was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on two <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> analyses made by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) on invasive alien plants (American skunk cabbage and floating pennywort). The Panel was in particular asked a) whether these organisms {{can be considered as}} harmful for the endangered area of the European Community and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in the plant health Directive 2000 / 29 /EC, and b) whether the identified management options are appropriate through an evaluation of their efficacy, feasibility and impact. This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> made by EPPO on Lysichiton americanus Hultén and St. John. L. americanus is a yellow-flowered herbaceous perennial plant known as American skunk cabbage or yellow skunk cabbage. It can be terrestrial, semi-aquatic and even aquatic. It has been introduced into Europe intentionally as an ornamental garden plant. It is naturalised in several European countries including Ireland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and UK. However, invasive behaviour has been reported in parts of Europe, with local species extinction reported in Germany. L. americanus is considered an invasive alien plant by EPPO and is included on the EPPO Action List (pests which EPPO recommend member countries to consider for inclusion in their phytosanitary regulations), with the entire EPPO region considered an endangered area. In delivering this opinion the Panel conducted a detailed review of the EPPO <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> provided, using the internationally accepted standard for <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> for quarantine <b>pests</b> ISPM No 11. The available information shows that Lysichiton americanus can be considered an invasive species with potential to cause environmental damage to ecologically vulnerable wetland habitats. However, the factors contributing to invasive behaviour are not well characterised and thus the endangered area cannot be clearly defined. Despite the presence of L. americanus in at least nine European countries, clear evidence of environmental damage has been found only in restricted areas of Germany. A more detailed analysis is required to identify the key factors contributing to invasive behaviour. Although the Panel recognises that invasiveness of a plant in one area can be a signal for its invasiveness elsewhere, it concludes that the information provided in the EPPO document is insufficient to confirm that L. americanus qualifies as a quarantine pest for the EC. The Panel considers that the significant knowledge gaps identified in the <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> assessment stage of the <b>pest</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> preclude a detailed evaluation of management options at this stage. The Panel suggests that further work, including monitoring and surveillance, is needed to address the areas of uncertainty identified in the EPPO document, in order to identify the areas of the European Community at risk and enable management options to be considered. These include:a) the effect of abiotic factors on the establishment, development, reproduction, survival and dispersal of the plant in both the native and introduced range;b) the population dynamics of the plant in areas where it is present but not invasive;c) the volume of trade in L. americanus as an ornamental plant entering and moving within the EC, including further analysis of the pathways through which it can reach natural water bodies;d) the nature and occurrence of areas within the EC where conditions result in invasiveness of the plant, supported by the use of modelling and geographic information system (GIS) tools. the environmental damage caused by the plant in areas where it is invasive...|$|R

The Panel concludes on the risk to plant health posed by Pomacea species in the „canaliculata complex‟, that out of the around 50 species in the genus of Pomacea, four species P. canaliculata, P. insularum, P. lineata and P. maculata belong to the „canaliculata complex‟, where P. insularum and P. maculata are recently considered to be synonyms.
