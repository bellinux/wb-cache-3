Bergland and col (Bergland et al. 1968) described three positions to the optic chiasm: prefixed, normal-fixed and <b>postfixed.</b> Renn & Rhoton (Renn & Rhoton 1975) found the chiasm normal-fixed in 70 % of cases, prefixed at 15 % and <b>postfixed</b> in the remain.|$|R

2500|$|Mathematicians who use <b>postfix</b> {{notation}} may write [...] "", meaning first apply [...] {{and then}} apply , {{in keeping with}} the order the symbols occur in <b>postfix</b> notation, thus making the notation [...] "" [...] ambiguous. [...] Computer scientists may write [...] "" [...] for this, thereby disambiguating the order of composition. To distinguish the left composition operator from a text semicolon, in the Z notation the ⨾ [...] character is used for left relation composition.

2500|$|As an example, the {{factorial}} function is defined on the nonnegative integers and produces a nonnegative integer. [...] It {{is defined by}} the following inductive algorithm: 0! is defined to be 1, and n! is defined to be n(n−1)! for all positive integers n. The {{factorial function}} is denoted with the exclamation mark (serving as the symbol of the function) after the variable (<b>postfix</b> notation).|$|E

2500|$|Standard Gerber was a {{numerical}} control (NC) format designed by Gerber Systems Corp to drive their vector photo plotters for the PCB {{industry in the}} 1960s and 1970s. It was {{a subset of the}} Electronic Industries Association RS-274-D specification, a format to drive mechanical NC machines {{in a wide range of}} industries. The term RS-274-D, without the qualifying [...] "Gerber" [...] <b>postfix,</b> is sometimes used informally for standard Gerber. Standard Gerber became the de facto standard format for PCB images.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packard (HP) {{had been}} {{developing}} a pocket calculator. Launched in early 1972, it was {{unlike the other}} basic four-function pocket calculators then available {{in that it was}} the first pocket calculator with scientific functions that could replace a slide rule. The $395 HP-35, along with nearly all later HP engineering calculators, used reverse Polish notation (RPN), also called <b>postfix</b> notation. A calculation like [...] "8 plus 5" [...] is, using RPN, performed by pressing [...] "8", [...] "Enter↑", [...] "5", and [...] "+"; instead of the algebraic infix notation: [...] "8", [...] "+", [...] "5", [...] "=". It had 35 buttons and was based on Mostek Mk6020 chip.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-20th century, some mathematicians {{decided that}} writing [...] "" [...] to mean [...] "first apply , then apply [...] " [...] was too {{confusing}} {{and decided to}} change notations. They write [...] "" [...] for [...] "" [...] and [...] "" [...] for [...] "". This can be more natural and seem simpler than writing functions on the left in some areas – in linear algebra, for instance, when [...] is a row vector and [...] and [...] denote matrices and the composition is by matrix multiplication. This alternative notation is called <b>postfix</b> notation. The order is important because matrix multiplication is non-commutative. Successive transformations applying and composing to the right agrees with the left-to-right reading sequence.|$|E
