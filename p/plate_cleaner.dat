40|$|During {{the dirt}} {{accumulation}} the operating {{efficiency of the}} cleaners is decreasing and can be restored by cleaning the surface of sedimental <b>plates</b> <b>cleaner.</b> The condition of washing cleaner from pollution is excess of stokes forces on sliding friction force and size that characterizes the roll friction. Inequalities for all computed values of stoke strength were arranged and solved relative to waste of certain cleaning fluids. Thus: the flushing gravity cleaner with considered detergents is possible, more efficient process is to wash with detergent that has higher kinematic viscosity coefficient. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cleaner fish, Labroides dimidiatus, {{prefer the}} mucus of the parrotfish, Chlorurus sordidus, to {{parasitic}} gnathiid isopods, {{the main items}} in their diet, indicating a major conflict between clients and cleaners over what the latter should eat during interactions. We tested whether the conflict varied with client species (and {{the quality of its}} mucus) and with the presence of blood in the gnathfids. First, we offered cleaners the choice between mucus of the parrotfish and that of the snapper, Lutjanus fulviflamma. When offered equal amounts of mucus on Plexiglas <b>plates,</b> <b>cleaners</b> readily developed a significant preference for the parrotfish mucus. Reducing the amount of parrotfish mucus by 75...|$|R

40|$|These authors suggest {{simplification}} of the technic {{by reducing}} the lactose content by addition of gentian violet, also Pasteurization in place of autoclaving. The announced value of gentian violet for preliminary enrichment of colon cultures is sustained, with <b>cleaner</b> <b>plates</b> and readier identification of colonies. Gentian violet has also advantages in ensuring keeping qualities in the broth...|$|R
50|$|Corrosion from rainwater, ice and {{lightning}} strikes has completely ravaged {{the upper half}} of the Eiffel Tower, and the iron is rusted through and teetering. A strong wind collapses it, and falls into the new marsh on the River Seine that has flooded the remnants of Paris. Thousands of wild boar (descendants of both the domestic pig and wild boar) live under the Tower's legs. The right arm of the Statue of Liberty falls to the ground. The head cracks off and follows the arm some time later. The iron that makes up its skeleton has rusted through, and both parts were too weak to stay up, but its skin of copper <b>plates</b> is <b>cleaner</b> now than before due to cleaner skies and less tarnishing.|$|R
