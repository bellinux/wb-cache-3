50|$|On {{subsequent}} occasions, the White Martians {{succeeded in}} breaking free of their <b>psychological</b> <b>imprisonment.</b> The first time, a single White Martian briefly believed {{itself to be}} Bruce Wayne due to the trauma of being caught in a flaming plane crash which erased the memory of its original human identity of a Wayne Enterprises employee; having been assigned a role as Wayne's secretary to {{keep a close eye}} on him, the Martian studied Wayne's schedule and assumed that he was Wayne. While the rest of the League kept an eye on the other Martians in case the renegade tried to 'wake them up', the Wayne Martian was defeated by a team consisting of Green Lantern, Steel, Big Barda, Orion, and Plastic Man (selected because they didn't know Batman's identity and thus wouldn't 'tip' the telepathic Martian off to the fact that he was a fake), Orion deliberately setting himself on fire to attack the Martian until Green Lantern threw a car onto the Martian to knock it out. The Martian programming was subsequently restored and the heroes made certain that the other Martians remained brainwashed, although Batman expressed some concern about their current strategy with the Martians.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{problems}} around the imprisonment of the female protagonist in Chalotte Perkins Gilman 2 ̆ 7 s short story entiled The Yellow Wallpaper. The focus of the analysis is on the actors and factors causing imprisonment, types dan impacts of imprisonment, efforts to overcome the imprisonment, and the end of the imprisonment experienced by the female protagonist. To analyse this problems, feminist literary criticism is used supported by the stereotypes of the nineteenth century women, the medical opinion at that time and the feminist perspective concerning the mental disorder experienced by women, and the concept of oppression in the imprisonment as well. The result shows that a woman who experiences the physical and <b>psychological</b> <b>imprisonment</b> in the patriarchal household area tends to have mental disorder as an alternative to gain freedom. The conclusion that can be drawn is that in the patriarchal environment women 2 ̆ 7 s movement area and psychological, emotional, intellectual actualization tend to be limited in which the women who fight against those linitations will get the stigma of suffering from mental illness...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{examines}} {{the backdrop for}} the Supreme Court’s expansive reading of the Fourth Amendment in Katz v. United States, namely, “The {{right of the people}} to be secure in their persons [...] . against unreasonable searches... shall not be violated. ” Katz, and perhaps more significantly its precursor, Olmstead v. United States, reflected not only a doctrinal move toward restricting government surveillance, but also a confluence of two approaches to judicial writing on the subject. The first was the traditional conceptual approach that law schools have long promoted; it consists of textual analysis that enables judges to designate the bright lines for shaping citizens’ and public officials’ conduct. The second was a narrative approach buried beneath the surface of the opinions; it consists of stories, some real, others projected, that enable judges to introduce long-standing social norms into their decision-making process. The narratives that Justices Holmes and Brandeis introduced in their respective dissenting opinions in Olmstead were reconfigurations of the “surveillance tragedy,” a narrative that antedated the framing of the Bill of Rights. In its most refined form, namely William Shakespeare’s Hamlet, the surveillance tragedy encompassed a range of themes, such as government excess, intrusions into citizens’ privacy with resulting paranoia, paralysis or <b>psychological</b> <b>imprisonment,</b> loss of citizen autonomy sufficient for a robust democracy, and ultimately the full-blown corruption and destruction of the state. This essay elaborates the surveillance tragedy more systematically, in part by giving critical attention to Hamlet itself, but also by showing how this narrative fleshes out much of what the conceptual dialogue of the Fourth Amendment omits...|$|E

40|$|After {{the return}} to China, the Hong Kong Government finally decided in January 2008 to reduce the Frontier Closed Area (FCA) {{coverage}} from about 2, 800 hectares to about 400 hectares and {{over half of the}} people residing inside the current FCA are no longer required to have a closed area permit to enter or leave the excised area. For over a century, Lin Ma Hang villagers, especially some Hakka women, can be considered as ambassadors promoting communication between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. They not only witnessed the changing relations between China and Britain, but they also moved between different identities as Chinese, Hakka and Hong Kong people. The history of Lin Ma Hang records the experience of a group of Chinese refugees with Hakka consciousness, mostly with the surname Yip, who lived under British and subsequently Japanese rule and became Hong Kong people after the Second World War. It also highlights the complex and multi-layered nature of Hakka identity. Emphasis has been placed on the manifestations and material culture of Hakka people, studies into their internal consciousness has not attracted much attention. Lin Ma Hang is a specific case to look into the Hakim psychology {{in the context of a}} closed area. Adjacent to the boundary between Hong Kong and the Mainland China, this is an indigenous Hakka-speaking village. For many years during the Qing Dynasty, its villagers had to walk on a bridge that enabled them to reach their farmland located on the other side of the Shenzhen River. However, after the Qing Government's signed unequal treaty, Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory in 1898 which allowed Britain to lease the New Territories, the original village area of Lin Ma Hang was divided into two parts - the Chinese side and the British side, with the Shenzhen River serving as the boundary. Indigenous villagers from Lin Ma Hang, which came under the jurisdiction of Britain, continued to cross this bridge to the Chinese side, just like their forefathers. Such border-crossing practice was maintained even during the 1960 s when the Mainland China suffered a famine which led to mass exoduses of people and political and social turmoil such as the Cultural Revolution. Since the 1980 s, the entire village has been enclosed by iron fences by the British for security reasons, which posed a formidable obstacle to the villagers' daily lives and travelling to nearby markets, and a <b>psychological</b> <b>imprisonment</b> in the minds of villagers, and their gradual loss of control of their farmland. However, it appears that the spirit of endurance embedded in Hakka culture had enabled them to overcome all types of obstacles and reestablish their confidence to communicate with the outside world, continuing their fight for the opening up of the closed area. Using Lin Ma Hang Village in Sha Tau Kok, Hong Kong's New Territories as a case study, this thesis gives an historical account of how indigenous villagers living in the border area adjusted to political and social changes following the lease of the New Territories by Britain until Hong Kong's return to China, and how they inherited the Hakka culture through different ways. With the case study of the Lin Ma Hang Hakka village, this thesis attempts to explore the Hakka culture that has been ignored by Hong Kong people. It signifies how an indigenous village, which was divided up due to political reasons, survives through its unique ways. 阮志偉. Adviser: Hok Ming Frederick Cheung; Pui Yin Ho.

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} some of {{the negative}} psychological effects of impris-onment. It examines the psychological stressors—dehumanization, depri-vation, and danger—to which prisoners are exposed, {{and the process of}} prisonization by which they attempt to accommodate to their conditions of confinement. It also discusses the effects of two opposite prison extremes, overcrowding and solitary confinement, as well as the kind of vulnerabilities that many prisoners bring to prison that make the experience a form of re-traumatization for them. The article ends with a set of brief, programmatic but psychologically informed proposals for change.

40|$|In {{light of}} the {{dramatic}} increase {{over the past decade}} in the number of women incarcerated in the Netherlands, we examined 251 female inmates' <b>psychological</b> reactions to <b>imprisonment</b> with a survey that taps importation and deprivation factors and related life experiences. While depressive complaints, irritability and risk of self-harm were all predicted by both sets of factors, the evidence suggests that deprivation factors have a greater impact on these measures of well-being than importation factors. Previous treatment for psychological problems was the most important covariate for psychological complaints and post-traumatic stress. The most important deprivation factors were treatment by staff and other inmates, and environmental stress. Accordingly, we suggest that in order to further our understanding of women prisoners' adaptations to incarceration greater attention should be directed to women's conditions of confinement and less to their histories of victimization and drug abuse. © The Author(s) 2011...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} the long-term mental sequelae of prolonged stress due to political persecution and imprisonment in the German Democratic Republic. Fifty-five former political prisoners with enduring psychiatric disorders were examined retrospectively in an exploratory study. The patients' experiences before, during, and after imprisonment were investigated using a semistructured interview. Psychopathological symptoms were assessed on clinical and self-rating scales; diagnostic classification was conducted according to DSM-III-R. The patients had experienced serious trauma, including <b>psychological</b> torture, long-term <b>imprisonment,</b> and solitary confinement. We diagnosed a characteristic syndrome involving symptoms of depression and anxiety with vegetative complaints and increased arousal. In 35 (64 %) patients, the symptoms persisted over an extended period without improvement. This syndrome resembles psychiatric disorders found after other forms of political persecution. It may be concluded that prolonged individually experienced political stress situations, even if they are not life-threatening, may have long-term mental sequelae...|$|R
40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the <b>psychological</b> effects of <b>imprisonment</b> in general, and {{long-term}} imprisonment in particular. Most of our knowledge about imprisonment and its effects is derived from American sociological research, such as the classic study by Clemmer (1940), Psychologists seem to have avoided the problem and what data exists bears on the topic only tangentially. This study is an attempt to begin the process of bringing a particularly psychological point of view to bear on the issue. The study is essentially a two-fold psychometric examination of the question of the effects of long-term imprisonment on personality (as measured by the Sysenck Personality Inventory, the Gough Femininity Scale, the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire) and attitudes (as measured by the Semantic Differential). First, a cross-sectional analysis is outlined which yields data on the differences between groups of men in prison who have served differing mean lengths of total imprisonment during their careers. Second, a longitudinal analysis is presented which illustrates the changes which took place over the relatively short test-retest interval of 19 months, A factor- analytical study of the cross-sectional data and more detailed longitudinal analyoes of identifiable psychometric groups are also presented. Finally, an attempt is made to integrate the results into a coherent picture and suggestions are proffered which, it is hoped, may be of use both to future researchers and to the custodians of long-term prisoners...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} {{experiences}} of South African women prior to, during and after incarceration. The theoretical bases for this study include the general strain theory (GST), feminist pathways approach and Goffman’s “total institutions”. The study made use of a qualitative research design. In-depth interviews were conducted with a total of twenty female ex-prisoners, who were selected using snowball sampling, to obtain information about their experiences during the periods indicated. The findings of the study indicated that, in respect of the three periods mentioned, the participants cited their experiences during incarceration as the most prominent as they tended to dwell more on this phase of their lives than any other phase. This is, in fact, not surprising as their narratives portrayed their lives behind bars as having been traumatic with far-reaching consequences for their lives after their incarceration. The study found that some of the participants had histories of emotional and physical abuse before their offending behaviours. It emerged that consensual same-sex sexual relationships between females in South African prisons exist and that these relationships are, sometimes, accepted by the family members of the female inmates. The participants reported that coercive sexual relationships also take place in female prisons in South Africa. It was also reported that the conditions under which females are incarcerated are, for the most part, deplorable. It emerged that the female prisoners use a unique monetary system which is based mainly on the trade by barter system. In addition, the findings revealed that female inmates often experience daunting challenges upon their release from prison, including high rates of unemployment, stigma and discrimination, family breakdown and the <b>psychological</b> effects of <b>imprisonment,</b> all of which often compound the resolve of some of the participants to live crime-free lives.
