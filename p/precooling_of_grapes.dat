40|$|Abstract A {{comprehensive}} {{investigation was}} conducted {{to determine the effects}} of exogenous melatonin treatment <b>of</b> pre-veraison <b>grapes</b> on phenolic components and antioxidants <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> berries and wine. The results showed an increase in the concentration of cyanin- 3 -O-glucoside, peonidin derivatives, and two flavanols [namely (+) -catechins and (−) -epicatechins] <b>of</b> <b>grapes,</b> as well as flavonols in both grapes and wine due to the application of melatonin. These compounds are derivatives of the catalysate of flavonoid 3 ’-hydroxylase (F 3 ’H) in the flavonoid synthesis pathway of plants. It can be inferred that melatonin increased the activity of F 3 ’H or expression of VvF 3 ’H during grape berry maturation. In addition, two melatonin treatments <b>of</b> pre-veraison <b>grape</b> berries reduced the DPPH radical-scavenging ability and copper ion-reducing power <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> and wine, whereas one melatonin treatment just reduced those in wine.
