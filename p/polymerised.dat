25|$|The {{group of}} algae {{known as the}} diatoms {{synthesize}} their cell walls (also known as frustules or valves) from silicic acid (specifically orthosilicic acid, H4SiO4). The acid is <b>polymerised</b> intra-cellularly, then the wall is extruded to protect the cell. Significantly, relative to the organic cell walls produced by other groups, silica frustules require less energy to synthesize (approximately 8%), potentially a major saving on the overall cell energy budget and possibly an explanation for higher growth rates in diatoms.|$|E

500|$|Ferrocene is a redox-active {{organometallic}} compound {{which can be}} incorporated into various monomers and used to make polymers which can be tethered onto a surface. [...] Vinylferrocene (ferroceneylethene) can be prepared by a Wittig reaction and then <b>polymerised</b> to form polyvinylferrocene (PVFc), an analogue of polystyrene. [...] Another polymer which can be formed is poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl ferrocenecarboxylate), PFcMA. [...] Both PVFc and PFcMA have been tethered onto silica wafers and the wettability measured when the polymer chains are uncharged and when the ferrocene moieties are oxidised to produce positively charged groups, as illustrated at right. [...] The contact angle with water on the PFcMA-coated wafers was 70 smaller following oxidation, while in the case of PVFc the decrease was 30, and the switching of wettability {{has been shown to be}} reversible. [...] In the PFcMA case, the effect of longer chains with more ferrocene groups (and also greater molar mass) has been investigated, and it was found that longer chains produce significantly larger contact angle reductions.|$|E
2500|$|PMMA {{has a good}} {{degree of}} {{compatibility}} with human tissue, and it {{is used in the}} manufacture of rigid intraocular lenses which are implanted in the eye when the original lens has been removed in the treatment of cataracts. This compatibility was discovered by the English ophthalmologist Sir Harold Ridley in WWII RAF pilots, whose eyes had been riddled with PMMA splinters coming from the side windows of their Supermarine Spitfire fighters – the plastic scarcely caused any rejection, compared to glass splinters coming from aircraft such as the Hawker Hurricane. Ridley had a lens manufactured by the Rayner company (Brighton & Hove, East Sussex) made from Perspex <b>polymerised</b> by ICI. On 29 November 1949 at St Thomas' Hospital, London, Ridley implanted the first intraocular lens at St Thomas's Hospital in London.|$|E
