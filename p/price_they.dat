5|$|During the Great Depression, Arrington {{was curious}} {{about the price of}} {{potatoes}} and set about his first economic experiment. He put slips of paper in some of the sacks of potatoes his family harvested, with the information that the potatoes were sold for five cents per hundred pound sack, and requested that the recipient tell him the <b>price</b> <b>they</b> paid via his address. Several people responded, and one person had paid two dollars for the same sack of potatoes.|$|E
5|$|The {{group were}} {{surprised}} to see how small and technically basic the studio was, with only one microphone in {{the centre of the}} room. Phillips demanded that they pay for the recording before they set up the equipment, so each member paid 3 shillings and 6 pence, but he then asked for an extra surcharge (£1) {{to cover the cost of}} transferring the tape recording to acetate disc. As this was too expensive, Phillips said that for a cut-rate <b>price</b> <b>they</b> would not be taped first, but record directly to vinyl.|$|E
5|$|Three {{individual}} models, or grades, {{were available}} on the car's release in 2006; S, M, and G, in ascending order of <b>price.</b> <b>They</b> all shared the same five-door hatchback body style and turbocharged engine, but offered differing levels of options and standard equipment. In 2007 the base S model was given the new naturally aspirated powerplant, and was positioned below the two new grades, L and LX, whose engine it shared.|$|E

5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the <b>price</b> <b>they</b> were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E
5|$|People were {{purchasing}} bulbs {{at higher}} and higher prices, intending to re-sell them for a profit. However, such a scheme could not last unless someone was ultimately willing to pay such high prices and take possession of the bulbs. In February 1637, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers willing to pay increasingly inflated prices for their bulbs. As this realization set in, the demand for tulips collapsed, and prices plummeted—the speculative bubble burst. Some were left holding contracts to purchase tulips at prices now ten times greater than those on the open market, while others found themselves in possession of bulbs now worth {{a fraction of the}} <b>price</b> <b>they</b> had paid. Mackay claims the Dutch devolved into distressed accusations and recriminations against others in the trade.|$|E
5|$|Starting in April 2006, Bethesda {{released}} small {{packages of}} additional downloadable content (DLC) {{for the game}} from their website and over the Xbox Live Marketplace. The first update came {{as a set of}} specialized armor for Oblivions ridable horses; released on April 3, 2006. Although gamers generally displayed enthusiasm for the concept of micropayments for downloadable in-game content, many expressed their dissatisfaction at the <b>price</b> <b>they</b> had to pay for the relatively minor horse-armor package on the Internet and elsewhere. Hines assured the press that Bethesda was not going to respond rashly to customer criticism. New releases continued into late 2006, at lower prices with more substantial content, leading to a better reception in the gaming press. Other small DLC packs include a set of houses themed after the game's factions, a new dungeon, and new spells that were absent in the initial release. Oblivions final content pack was released October 15, 2007.|$|E

25|$|In {{a similar}} manner Friends avoid haggling over <b>prices.</b> <b>They</b> simply set a fixed <b>price</b> that <b>they</b> {{considered}} fair, which went against the custom of earlier times, but was felt by them to be simpler and more honest (this practice is generally considered more {{a part of the}} Testimony of Integrity than a part of the Testimony of Simplicity).|$|R

5|$|With {{the success}} of his chain of bookstores, Wilkinson pursued other {{business}} ventures in the fields of real estate development, farming, transportation, banking, coal interests, and construction. He purchased several private aircraft to help him tend to his diverse interests throughout the state, and in 1973, created Wilkinson Flying Service to keep the planes busy when he wasn't using them. After investing in the unfinished Bluegrass Commerce Center in Lexington in early 1977, he purchased one-third interest in the Purcell building on Lexington's Vine Street later that year. The building was only partially occupied, but had become more valuable because of the opening of nearby Rupp Arena in October 1976 and a new Hyatt hotel in May 1977. Developers Donald and Dudley Webb developed plans to construct the Vine Center on the block; by May 1979, they had options to buy every property on the block except Wilkinson's interest in the Purcell building. Unwilling to meet Wilkinson's asking <b>price,</b> <b>they</b> instead formed a partnership with him to co-develop the Vine Center. When Wilkinson eventually sold his interest in the venture at the end of 1981, he turned a profit of at least $1.3 million on his investment. Next, he formed a public-private partnership with the city of Lexington to construct the Capital Plaza Hotel in 1983. The city provided $3 million in capital and another $8.5 million in guaranteed loans to supplement Wilkinson's $1.15 million investment. Wallace's Book Stores was given 95% ownership in the hotel, allowing the company to shield $2 million in assets from federal income taxes and claim over $400,000 in tax credits.|$|E

25|$|The {{different}} valuation modes co-exist in {{the real}} world and are not mutually exclusive.

25|$|A supply {{schedule}} is a table {{that shows the}} relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied. Under the assumption of perfect competition, supply is determined by marginal cost. That is, firms will produce additional output while the cost of producing an extra unit of output is less than the <b>price</b> <b>they</b> would receive.|$|E

25|$|Mineral {{industry}} corporations use territory {{occupied by}} indigenous populations {{to carry out}} their operations. In the process, they compromise land and water resources, taking away the community's livelihood assets and sources of cultural identity. Corporations attempt to compensate for these changes through the <b>price</b> <b>they</b> pay for using the land, offering employment to the local population, and implementing community development programs.|$|E
25|$|A forward {{contract}} is {{an agreement between}} two parties to exchange at some fixed future date a given quantity of a commodity for a price defined when the contract is finalized. The fixed price {{is known as the}} forward price. Such {{forward contract}}s began as a way of reducing pricing risk in food and agricultural product markets, because farmers knew what <b>price</b> <b>they</b> would receive for their output.|$|E

25|$|Also that month, AOL {{informed}} its American customers {{it would}} be increasing the price of its dial-up access to US$25.90. The increase {{was part of an}} effort to migrate the service's remaining dial-up users to broadband, as the increased price was the same <b>price</b> <b>they</b> had been charging for monthly DSL access. However, AOL has since started offering their services for $9.95 a month for unlimited dial-up access.|$|E

Fincham commented that it was 'a big loss', but that BBC One would not pay 'the best part of £300million'. Neighbours left the channel in spring 2008 to move to Channel 5. The Weakest Link was moved from BBC Two to fill the gap, with the afternoon CBBC slot moving 20minutes earlier.|$|E
