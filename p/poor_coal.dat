5|$|In 1966, Stella North was at {{the centre}} of a legal case in which three men were found guilty of {{conspiracy}} to defraud after {{trying to sell the}} CEGB poor quality coal when contracted to deliver high quality coal. The three men involved were D.C.P. Brooksbank, a salesman for a coal firm; J.W. Patterson, a sampler at the power station, and M. Ridley, a contractor. Their scheme was for Patterson to substitute samples of reasonably good coal for the samples of <b>poor</b> <b>coal</b> taken from the lorries. However they were found out only two days after starting the scheme, when a foreman at the station saw Patterson dropping a bag of cement into the sampling bin, and reported the incident. Ridley was found to have planned the fraud, and was jailed for a year, while Brooksbank was fined £150 and Patterson £75.|$|E

2500|$|Although it {{had been}} built to work the Western line to Ararat, a number of bridges along the route {{required}} strengthening before the H class locomotive with its 23¼ ton axle load could enter regular service on that line. The necessary work was deferred due to wartime restrictions on available resources. Therefore, H220 was put {{to work on the}} only line able to accommodate its loading gauge and high axle load, the North-Eastern line to Albury, where it hauled express passenger services, fast goods services, troop trains, and on the odd occasion when the regular S class Pacific was not available, the Spirit of Progress, particularly in the postwar period when S class locomotives were affected by <b>poor</b> <b>coal</b> and reduced availability. H220 gave an indication of its capabilities on one such run of the Spirit in the late 1940s by reportedly topping the [...] long 1 in 50 Glenroy Bank at [...] (three times the typical S class-hauled speed at this point,) going on to pass Seymour 13 minutes ahead of schedule and arriving at Albury at 20 minutes ahead of the 10:40 pm scheduled arrival time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some {{families}} will employ the cheapest physician, {{without regard to}} his ability to kill or cure; some will treat diseases in their incipiency with quack medicines, bought cheap, hoping thereby {{to fend off the}} doctor's bill. Some women seem to be pursued by an evil demon of economy, which, like an ignis fatuus in a bog, delights constantly to tumble them over into the mire of expense. They are dismayed at the quantity of sugar in the recipe for preserves, leave out a quarter, and the whole ferments and is spoiled. They cannot by any means be induced at any one time to buy enough silk to make a dress, and the dress finally, after many convulsions and alterations, must be thrown by altogether as too scanty. They get poor needles, poor thread, poor sugar, poor raisins, poor tea, <b>poor</b> <b>coal.</b> One wonders, in looking at their blackened, smouldering grates in a freezing day, what the fire is there at all for,--it certainly warms nobody. The only thing they seem likely to be lavish in is funeral expenses, which come in the wake of leaky shoes and imperfect clothing. These funeral expenses at last swallow all, since nobody can dispute an undertaker's bill. One pities these joyless beings. Economy, instead of a rational act of the judgment, is a morbid monomania, eating the pleasure out of life, and haunting them to the grave.|$|E
50|$|Around 1700 <b>poor</b> quality <b>coal</b> was found, {{close by}} the surface, just over the River Don from Mexborough and this, in time, led to the sinking of two shafts, in 1863, for Denaby Main Colliery Company, owned by Messrs Pope and Pearson.

50|$|Mostly these colonies (particularly {{the textile}} related ones) were {{constructed}} {{close to a}} river. This was because they used hydraulic power (waterwheels) to run the factory.

In addition, the Catalan rivers (with little volume but a very steep sloping run) provided free and almost inexhaustible energy, that was lacking only in times of drought.|$|R

50|$|They were {{of typical}} American design at the time, with bar frames, spacious cabs and high running boards.

These qualities, with their roomy cabs and general handiness, made them popular with the enginemen, who nicknamed them Hatracks.|$|R
50|$|The {{quality of}} the coal {{supplied}} has degraded considerably. At worst times, there were many unit tripping owing to poor quality. The <b>poor</b> <b>coal</b> quality also put burdens on equipment, like mills and their performance also goes down.The coal for the plant is fetched from far away, that makes the total fuel cost double of coal cost at coalmine. This factor, coupled with low efficiency due to aging and old design makes electricity of the plant costlier.|$|E

50|$|There {{are thin}} seams of <b>poor</b> quality <b>coal</b> {{to the north}} of the island which have been used over the years. Attempts were made to mine this on a {{significant}} scale in the early 19th century. Costs, quality and quantity meant this ultimately came to nothing as cheap, accessible coal became readily available elsewhere. Some coal used in the nineteenth century was brought in by ship from Scotland, but the majority was shipped in from further south in Northumberland.|$|R
50|$|While the <b>poor</b> quality <b>coal</b> from Indwe and Molteno, {{with a high}} {{ash content}} and a {{tendency}} to clinker, had an equally {{negative effect on the}} performance of both types, the Fairlie proved to be more economical on coal and water. Only two men were allowed to be working each type during the trials, but on the back-to-back engines this was found to be insufficient since both men were exhausted after the short 32 mi run.|$|R
50|$|At the Saltcoats coal yards {{the coal}} was shovelled into carts and then taken the half {{mile to the}} waiting ships where it was simply tumbled into hold causing more {{breakage}} and reduction in the coal size which was however said to suit {{the needs of the}} Irish market. The boats using the harbour could carry around 300 cart loads of coal at a time. 'Panwood' was a <b>poorer</b> quality <b>coal</b> not usually exported that was suitable for the saltpans.|$|R
50|$|Although {{initially}} <b>poor,</b> <b>coal</b> fields {{found in}} the 1880s proved prosperous. The branch provided revenue even through World War II. However, around this time the coal supply declined and highway access increased. This led to {{the closing of the}} B&M branch in 1942. Passenger service to Washington halted on July 20, 1952. The double track changed to a single and stations decreased. The Westland and Palanka branches was abandoned in 1955. On August 4, 1959, the connection with the main line at Carnegie was abandoned for a short run over the Pittsburgh, Chartiers & Youghiogheny Railway trackage rights. Signals were also abandoned and removed at this time.|$|E
50|$|Olszak {{was born}} in Šenov as a tenth child of a peasant. After {{elementary}} school he attended the German gymnasium (high school) in Cieszyn, from which he graduated in 1889. He went to Vienna to study medicine at the University of Vienna. He graduated in 1895. After returning to his region, Olszak started {{to work as a}} doctor in Karviná, becoming the first Polish doctor for coal miners in that town. He also worked as a doctor at the château in Fryštát for count Larisch-Mönnich, and as a family doctor for many local German engineers and administration workers. Olszak however, working mostly with <b>poor</b> <b>coal</b> miners and their families, helped to organize a social help for them.|$|E
50|$|The {{club was}} founded on 8 September 1922 as SK Slezská Ostrava, when 20 activists signed the {{establishment}} treaty in the U Dubu restaurant. The signatories were mostly <b>poor</b> <b>coal</b> miners from the Kamenec coal mining settlement in Ostrava. The organizers of the founding were Karel Aniol, Arnošt Haberkiewicz, Petr Křižák, František Mruzek and Jaroslav Horák. The club was officially registered on 14 October 1922. Karel Aniol became the club's first president. First jerseys of SK Slezská Ostrava were red-white striped. Since April 1923, however the club played with white jerseys and blue shorts. These colours were used since then. The first match ever occurred on 4 March 1923, when SK Slezská Ostrava faced reserve team of famous local side Slovan Ostrava.|$|E
50|$|The city of Chicago {{and some}} of its older suburbs are heavily Democratic. While this {{tendency}} has historically been balanced by Republican voters in the suburbs, Democrats have significantly increased their suburban support in the past decade. Central Illinois's largely rural character helps to sustain a largely Republican voting pattern and widespread antipathy toward Chicago. The combination of <b>poorer</b> soil, <b>coal</b> mining and industrialization has caused the southern region to lean Democratic politically, especially in the urbanized region around Saint Louis, Missouri.|$|R
50|$|Both types {{performed}} well on curves and while climbing inclines, but the Double Fairlie was the superior engine when descending down inclines, where it gave a smoother ride. The Double Fairlie also {{proved to be}} more economical on coal and water, but it had an inadequate coal and water carrying capacity. The <b>poor</b> quality <b>coal</b> from Indwe and Molteno, with a high ash content and a tendency to clinker, had an equally negative effect on the performance of both types.|$|R

In 1965, #60 was purchased by the newly formed short line Black River & Western for tourist excursions. Although she was used on off line excursions previously, the locomotive hauled its first train (on BR&W trackage) on May 17, 1965.|$|R

50|$|The most {{historically}} important {{buildings in}} the district are the St. Martin Church (inaugurated 1791), the Schönau Castle (Schloss Schönau), and the water fortress Heyden House (Haus Heyden), in Horbach. St. Martin Church contains the Maaß Organ, which was built in 1836 and is the oldest organ in Aachen. Schönau Castle is today home to a restaurant and is available to residents as a cultural center and host to various events. Heyden House is now used for residential purposes. Besides a few houses from the 18th Century in the old village, there are several well-preserved old estates, such as the Gut Bau (built in 1750) and the Zehnthof, which is where farmers tithed what they owed during the Middle Ages. From 1911 until 1927 the Carl Friedrich mine was the most southerly mine of Aachen’s Wurmrevier coal region. The workforce consisted of about 500 people, but the mine was shut down after only 16 years, due to unfavorable tectonic conditions and <b>poor</b> <b>coal</b> quality.|$|E
5000|$|Bosley Crowther of the New York Times said: [...] "Sons and Lovers is sensitively {{felt and}} photographed in Jerry Wald's British-made {{film version of}} (Lawrence's novel). ... Jack Cardiff, {{cameraman}} turned director, has filled it with picture poetry. ... The drabness of a north-of-England coal town, the warmth of a <b>poor</b> <b>coal</b> miner's home, the bleakness of the wintry English country near Eastwood, where Lawrence was born — all are caught and concentrated in this film, appropriately black-and-white, which puts forth the generalized Lawrence story in a stunning pictorial style. ... (T)he most dynamic and emotional character in the film is the discarded miner-father, played brilliantly by Trevor Howard. His frequent violent flare-ups of rebellion, his pitiful complaints of chagrin and his always underflowing indications {{of a sense of}} being not wanted and alone are perhaps the most clear articulations of the theme of frustration in the tale. Through him is expressed most intensely the realization of the mortality of young love." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1993, the smokebox {{extension}} {{added in}} the 1940s by the Great Western to allow the locomotive to burn <b>poorer</b> grades of <b>coal</b> was removed {{in order to improve}} drafting.

50|$|Belpaire {{was then}} {{employed}} at the Belgian State Railways , {{where he worked}} as a mechanical engineer for more than 50 years. He was first director of the railway workshops at Mechelen and then from 1850 put in charge of all materials and based in Brussels. He first developed a firebox to burn <b>poor</b> quality <b>coals</b> and then around 1860 generalised his invention into a robust thermally efficient design which bears his name. His firebox was used in locomotives in his native Belgium and also then extensively in Britain, North America and around the world.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were, at the time, {{modern and}} up to date with latest practices and were possibly the most efficient engines in the country. As was usual practice with passenger locomotives on the CGR, they were painted green and had polished brass domes. They were placed in service on the easier sections of the Western System and were used on all types of traffic. On the section between Beaufort West and Kimberley, they worked passenger trains successfully {{in spite of the}} <b>poor</b> quality <b>coal</b> from the colliery at Viljoensdrif, thanks to their more liberally-proportioned boilers.|$|R
