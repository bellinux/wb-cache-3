The legal battle had been lost, the {{railroad}} had won, {{and there was not}} enough public support for changing the policy of granting public lands to railroads. The only concession SP made was to reduce the land price slightly. In the end, most <b>people</b> <b>simply</b> stayed where they were and purchased the land.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of TB uses {{antibiotics}} to {{kill the}} bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective. The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin, and treatments can be prolonged, taking several months. Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics {{to reduce the risk}} of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life. Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics. The evidence to support this practice over <b>people</b> <b>simply</b> taking their medications independently is of poor quality. There is no strong evidence indicating that directly observed therapy improves the number of people who were cured or the number of people who complete their medicine. Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is also no difference if people are observed at home versus at a clinic, or by a family member versus a health care worker. Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment and appointments may result in a small but important improvement.|$|E
25|$|Nudity was {{a factor}} at all Nambassa festivals.

Thousands of <b>people</b> <b>simply</b> got naked and wandered the festivals with little or no clothing.|$|E

Many <b>people</b> <b>simply</b> conformed outwardly and pretended to become Christian while secretly continuing to practice their beliefs.

Six months later, Zamora was informed that he had been chosen to be a castmate on the show, beating out 25,000 applicants.|$|E
25|$|Though {{only some}} Nations' sun dances include the body piercings, the Canadian Government outlawed that {{feature of the}} sun dance in 1895. It is unclear how often this law was {{actually}} enforced; {{in at least one}} instance, police are known to have given their permission for the ceremony to be conducted. The First Nations <b>people</b> <b>simply</b> conducted many ceremonies quietly and in secret. After gaining better understanding of and respect for Indigenous traditions, the government ended its prohibitions. Since 1951 Canada lifted its ban on the ceremony. The sun dance is practiced annually on many reserves and reservations in Canada.|$|E

25|$|Estimates of the Somali-born {{population}} are {{complicated by the}} exchange of Somalis both arriving in the UK and those deciding to return to Somalia or elsewhere. According to academic Laura Hammond, this mobility is common within the Somali diaspora, with many having residences in both Somalia and the UK. Somali immigrants from the more stable regions of Somalia often vacation in those areas for extended periods during the summer. The United Nations Development Programme estimated in 2009 that 10,000 Somalis were visiting the northwestern Somaliland region from the UK annually, though Hammond argues that this total may also include <b>people</b> <b>simply</b> transferring through the UK.|$|E
25|$|In the United States {{there are}} many laws that allow the {{confiscation}} of cash and other assets from the bearer if there is suspicion that the money came from an illegal activity. Because {{a significant amount of}} U.S. currency contains traces of cocaine and other illegal drugs, {{it is not uncommon for}} innocent people searched at airports or stopped for traffic violations to have cash in their possession sniffed by dogs for drugs and then have the cash seized because the dog smelled drugs on the money. It is then up to the owner of the money to prove where the cash came from at his own expense. Many <b>people</b> <b>simply</b> forfeit the money. In 1994, the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, held in the case of UNITED STATES of America v. U.S. CURRENCY, $30,060.00 (39 F.3d 1039 63 USLW 2351, No. 92-55919) that the widespread presence of illegal substances on paper currency in the Los Angeles area created a situation where the reaction of a drug-sniffing dog would not create probable cause for civil forfeiture.|$|E

50|$|The {{authorities}} {{believed that}} the two <b>peoples</b> <b>simply</b> could not co-exist. Therefore, Governor Haldimand (at the suggestion of Carleton) drew Loyalists away from Quebec City and Montreal by offering free land on the northern shore of Lake Ontario to anyone willing to swear allegiance to George III. The Loyalists were thus given land grants of 200 acre per person. Basically, this approach was designed {{with the intent of}} keeping French and English as far apart as possible. Therefore, after the separation of the Province of Quebec, Lower Canada and Upper Canada were formed, each with its own government.|$|R
500|$|Historian Erich Haberer {{notes that}} many survived and made {{sense of the}} [...] "totalitarian atomization" [...] of society by seeking {{conformity}} with communism. As a result, {{by the time of}} the German invasion in 1941, many had come to see conformity with a totalitarian regime as socially acceptable behaviour; thus, <b>people</b> <b>simply</b> transferred their allegiance to the German regime when it arrived. Some who had collaborated with the Soviet regime sought to divert attention from themselves by naming Jews as collaborators and killing them.|$|E
500|$|The {{years after}} the Dartmouth conference were an era of discovery, of sprinting across new ground.

Few at the time would have believed that such [...] "intelligent" [...] behavior by machines was possible at all. Researchers expressed an intense optimism in private and in print, predicting that a fully intelligent machine would be built in less than 20 years. Government agencies like DARPA poured money into the new field.|$|E

Working together, we have soundly refuted those suspicions through our actions {{over the past two}} months. ... The story unfairly maligned UVA and many members of our community." ...|$|E

500|$|Simon Leng, Harrison's musical biographer, {{describes}} the period {{immediately following the}} tour as [...] "open season on Harrison". Whereas Rolling Stone had declared in 1973 that Harrison had [...] "inherited the most precious Beatle legacy – the spiritual aura that the group accumulated", now the magazine's album reviewer attacked him for his [...] "insufferable" [...] spiritual preoccupations. Writing in the NME, Woffinden similarly dismissed Dark Horse as [...] "the product of a complete egotist ... someone whose universe is confined to himself. And his guru." [...] Privately, Harrison descended into a [...] "spiritual funk", Tillery writes. Another biographer, Joshua Greene, concludes of Harrison's post-tour mindset: [...] "He grappled with the depressing realization that most <b>people</b> <b>simply</b> didn't care to hear about Krishna or maya or getting liberated from birth and death ... A man whose natural instinct was to share his life-transforming discoveries with others had been rejected ..." ...|$|E
500|$|The comrades {{eventually}} {{decide to}} act on their own, calling themselves [...] "Freeborn British Communists". They start experimenting with explosives and build a car bomb. Alice does not fully support this action, but accepts the majority decision. They target an upmarket hotel in Knightsbridge, but their inexperience results in the premature detonation of the bomb, which kills Faye and several passers-by. The remaining comrades, shaken by what they have done, decide to leave the squat and split up. Alice, disillusioned by Jasper, chooses not to follow him and remains behind because she cannot bear to abandon the house into which she has poured so much effort. Despite her initial reservations about the bombing, Alice feels a need to justify their actions to others, but realises it would be fruitless because [...] "rdinary <b>people</b> <b>simply</b> didn't understand". She acknowledges {{that she is a}} terrorist now, though she cannot remember when the change happened.|$|E
