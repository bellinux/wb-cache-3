5|$|In 356 BC, Philip then besieged and {{captured}} Potidea, thus marking {{the beginning of}} true hostilities with Athens. As <b>promised,</b> <b>he</b> handed Potidea over to the Olynthians, and let the Athenian garrison depart freely back to Athens, since {{he did not want}} to cause undue offence to the Athenians ("he was particularly solicitous toward the people of Athens on account of the importance and repute of their city"). The Athenians were by this time fully engaged in fighting the Social War, and were unable to respond effectively to Philip's moves against Potidea and Pydna.|$|E
5|$|John Hunyadi died on 11 August 1456, {{less than}} three weeks after his {{greatest}} victory over the Ottomans in Belgrade. John's elder sonMatthias's brotherLadislaus became the head of the family. Ladislaus's conflict with Ulrich of Celje ended with Ulrich's capture and assassination on 9 November. Under duress, the King <b>promised</b> <b>he</b> would never take his revenge against the Hunyadis for Ulrich's killing. However, the murder turned most baronsincluding Palatine Ladislaus Garai, Judge royal Ladislaus Pálóci, and Nicholas Újlaki, Voivode of Transylvaniaagainst Ladislaus Hunyadi. Taking advantage of their resentment, the King had the Hunyadi brothers imprisoned in Buda on 14 March 1457. The royal council condemned them to death for high treason and Ladislaus Hunyadi was beheaded on 16 March.|$|E

5|$|Anne {{became a}} general {{favourite}} {{with the people}} she met either at The Hague or at the Princess of Orange's country house at Teylingen. She was very attractive and stylish, and attracted many men. One of the first men {{to fall in love}} with Anne was Spencer Compton, a son of the Earl of Northampton. However, Anne quickly fell in love with Henry Jermyn, who returned her feelings. Anne dismissed Jermyn just as quickly when she met James, Duke of York, the son of the deposed king. On 24 November 1659, two or three years after she first met him, James <b>promised</b> <b>he</b> would marry Anne. Charles, James' brother, forced him reluctantly into this, saying that her strong character would be a positive influence on his weak-willed brother.|$|E
5|$|In late 1960 {{or early}} 1961, Thorpe visited Vater at the Kingham Stables, and briefly met Josiffe. He was {{sufficiently}} {{taken with the}} young man to suggest that, should Josiffe ever need help, he should call on him at the House of Commons. Soon after this, Josiffe left the stables after a serious disagreement with Vater. He then suffered a mental breakdown, and for much of 1961 was under psychiatric care. On 8 November 1961, a week after discharging himself from the Ashurst clinic, Josiffe went to the House of Commons to see Thorpe. He was penniless, homeless and, worse, had left Vater's employment without the National Insurance card which, at that time, was essential for obtaining regular work and access to social and unemployment benefits. Thorpe <b>promised</b> <b>he</b> would help.|$|E

Lauren starts to suspect Max as he has become violent towards other people, but he tells her he promised {{to look after the}} real killer, who is no longer a danger. When Lauren sees Stacey dancing with Max, she accuses her of trying flirting with Max, but Stacey says they are just friends and he <b>promised</b> <b>he</b> would always look out for her. Lauren realises that Stacey is the killer and tells Max she knows this. She confronts Stacey, who confesses, and Lauren records it on her mobile phone. Lauren later hands the recording to Janine as Stacey and Ryan have begun having an affair. Max wipes the recording so on Christmas Eve, Janine publicly announces in the pub after trying to play the recording that Stacey killed Archie.

5|$|Meanwhile, Malcolm Wynn-Jones (Hugh Simon) discovers a {{communication}} burst {{coming from the}} North Sea, believing a Russian submarine is entering British waters unannounced {{to carry out a}} mission. After learning that Alexander Beletsky (Georg Nikoloff), a man with connections to Kachimov, is going to shut down his company's servers, Malcolm confirms his suspicions; the Russians are planning a cyber attack against Britain by breaking into a submarine communications cable and shutting down every computer system in the country. Harry urges Dolby to temporarily shut down the Internet, but is once again denied. Later, Ros breaks into Lucas' flat while he is away, and discovers Lucas is a double agent, feeding the Russians news that MI5 know about their planned attack. Ros tasers Lucas and brings him back to Thames House. Lucas admits he is spying for the Russians because Kachimov <b>promised</b> <b>he</b> would be released from prison sooner if he would, but also reveals he intends to bring Kachimov down by making him trust Lucas.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} first {{presented}} to the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milošević. Milošević found the plan wholly acceptable and <b>promised</b> <b>he</b> would ensure {{the leadership of the}} RSK eventually supported it. He endorsed the plan because it ensured the preservation of Serbian territorial gains of 1991, retained Croatian Serb administration of the areas where the peacekeepers would be deployed and allowed the JNA to shift its focus to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Vance then met Yugoslav defence minister JNA General Veljko Kadijević, who also endorsed the plan and was apparently urged by Milošević to do so. After the plan was accepted by Croatian President Franjo Tuđman, the Geneva Accord was signed by Tuđman, Milošević and Kadijević in Geneva, Switzerland, on 23 November 1991. The Accord was a precondition for the deployment of the UN peacekeeping force. It comprised four provisions; the end of the Croatian blockade of JNA barracks, the withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the implementation of a ceasefire and the facilitation of the delivery of humanitarian aid.|$|E
5|$|Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland, also {{supported}} Richard's seizure of {{the throne of}} England. The Percys were loyal Lancastrians, but Edward IV eventually won the earl's allegiance. Northumberland had been captured and imprisoned by the Yorkists in 1461, losing his titles and estates; however, Edward released him eight years later and restored his earldom. From that time Northumberland served the Yorkist crown, helping to defend northern England and maintain its peace. Initially the earl had issues with Richard III as Edward groomed his brother to be the leading power of the north. Northumberland was mollified when he was <b>promised</b> <b>he</b> would be the Warden of the East March, a position that was formerly hereditary for the Percys. He served under Richard during the 1482 invasion of Scotland, and the allure {{of being in a}} position to dominate the north of England if Richard went south to assume the crown was his likely motivation for supporting Richard's bid for kingship. However, after becoming king, Richard began moulding his nephew, John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln, to manage the north, passing over Northumberland for the position. According to Carpenter, although the earl was amply compensated, he despaired of any possibility of advancement under Richard.|$|E
