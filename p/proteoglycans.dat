5|$|The {{triggers}} for precipitation of {{uric acid}} {{are not well}} understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, {{it is more likely}} to do so as levels increase. Other triggers believed to be important in acute episodes of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, articular hydration and extracellular matrix proteins, such as <b>proteoglycans,</b> collagens and chondroitin sulfate. The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to factors including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics and stopping or starting allopurinol. Calcium channel blockers and losartan are associated with a lower risk of gout compared to other medications for hypertension.|$|E

The RhoA pathway is involved. Chondroitin sulfate <b>proteoglycans</b> (CSPGs) {{have been shown to be}} up regulated in the central nervous system (CNS) following injury. Repeating disaccharides of glucuronic acid and galactosamine, glycosaminoglycans (CS-GAGs), are covalently coupled to the protein core CSPGs.

25|$|However, during {{onset of}} osteoarthritis, the {{collagen}} matrix becomes more disorganized {{and there is}} a decrease in proteoglycan content within cartilage. The breakdown of collagen fibers results in a net increase in water content. This increase occurs because whilst there is an overall loss of <b>proteoglycans</b> (and thus a decreased osmotic pull), it is outweighed by a loss of collagen. Without the protective effects of the <b>proteoglycans,</b> the collagen fibers of the cartilage can become susceptible to degradation and thus exacerbate the degeneration. Inflammation of the synovium (joint cavity lining) and the surrounding joint capsule can also occur, though often mild (compared to the synovial inflammation that occurs in rheumatoid arthritis). This can happen as breakdown products from the cartilage are released into the synovial space, and the cells lining the joint attempt to remove them.|$|E

40|$|The {{rates of}} 35 S-sulfate {{incorporation}} into <b>proteoglycan</b> were compared in multi-scratch wounded and confluent cultures of bovine aortic endothelial cells {{to determine whether}} <b>proteoglycan</b> synthesis is altered as cells are stimulated to migrate and proliferate.

Quantitative autoradiography of 35 S- sulfate-labeled single-scratch wounded cultures demonstrated a 2 - 4 -fold {{increase in the number of}} silver grains over migrating cells near the wound edge when compared to cells remote from the wound edge. Furthermore, when cell proliferation was blocked by inhibition of DNA synthesis, the increase in 35 S-sulfate incorporation into <b>proteoglycan</b> after wounding was unaffected. These data indicate that cell division is not required for the modulation of <b>proteoglycan</b> synthesis to occur after wounding. Characterization of the newly synthesized <b>proteoglycan</b> by ion-exchange and molecular sieve chromatography demonstrated that heparan sulfate <b>proteoglycan</b> constitutes approximately 80 % of the labeled <b>proteoglycan</b> in postconfluent cultures, while after wounding, chondroitin sulfate <b>proteoglycan</b> and/or dermatan sulfate <b>proteoglycan</b> (CS/DSPG) increases to as much as 60 % of the total labeled <b>proteoglycan.</b> These results suggest that CS/DSPG synthesis is stimulated concomitant with the stimulation of endothelial cell migration after wounding...|$|R

25|$|While {{osteoarthritis}} is a degenerative {{joint disease}} that may cause gross cartilage loss and morphological damage to other joint tissues, more subtle biochemical changes {{occur in the}} earliest stages of osteoarthritis progression. The water content of healthy cartilage is finely balanced by compressive force driving water out and hydrostatic and osmotic pressure drawing water in. Collagen fibres exert the compressive force, whereas the Gibbs–Donnan effect and cartilage <b>proteoglycans</b> create osmotic pressure which tends to draw water in.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} and function of the Golgi apparatus are intimately linked. Individual stacks have different assortments of enzymes, allowing for progressive processing of cargo proteins as they travel from the cisternae to the trans Golgi face. Enzymatic reactions within the Golgi stacks occur exclusively near its membrane surfaces, where enzymes are anchored. This feature {{is in contrast to}} the ER, which has soluble proteins and enzymes in its lumen. Much of the enzymatic processing is post-translational modification of proteins. For example, phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on lysosomal proteins occurs in the early CGN. Cis cisterna are associated with the removal of mannose residues. Removal of mannose residues and addition of N-acetylglucosamine occur in medial cisternae. Addition of galactose and sialic acid occurs in the trans cisternae. Sulfation of tyrosines and carbohydrates occurs within the TGN. Other general post-translational modifications of proteins include the addition of carbohydrates (glycosylation) and phosphates (phosphorylation). Protein modifications may form a signal sequence that determines the final destination of the protein. For example, the Golgi apparatus adds a mannose-6-phosphate label to proteins destined for lysosomes. Another important function of the Golgi apparatus is in the formation of <b>proteoglycans.</b> Enzymes in the Golgi append proteins to glycosaminoglycans, thus creating <b>proteoglycans.</b> Glycosaminoglycans are long unbranched polysaccharide molecules present in the extracellular matrix of animals.|$|E

In addition, age-related changes, with respect to the occurrence of keratan sulphate and the sulphation of chondroitin sulphate chains, were common to both tissues. The presence of aggregated <b>proteoglycan</b> was demonstrated, although specific interaction with hyaluronic acid was not conclusively shown biochemically. Differences were, however, noted {{in the structure of the}} <b>proteoglycan</b> between the two tissues: dermatan sulphate was found in the meniscus <b>proteoglycan</b> preparation and the core proteins exhibited some dissimilarities.

40|$|Epithelial {{cells are}} {{organized}} into either {{a single layer}} (simple epithelia) or multiple layers (stratified epithelia). Maintenance of these cellular organizations requires distinct adhesive mechanisms involving many cell surface molecules. One such molecule is a cell surface <b>proteoglycan,</b> named syndecan, that contains both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains. This <b>proteoglycan</b> binds cells to fibrillar collagens and fibronectin and thus acts as a receptor for interstitial matrix. The <b>proteoglycan</b> is restricted to the basolateral surface of simple epithelial cells, but is located over the entire surface of stratified epithelial cells, even those surfaces not contacting matrix. We now show that the distinct localization in simple and stratified epithelia correlates with a distinct <b>proteoglycan</b> structure. The <b>proteoglycan</b> from simple epithelia (modal molecular size, 160 kDa) is larger than that from stratified epithelia (modal molecular size, 92 kDa), but their core proteins are identical in size and immunoreactivity. The <b>proteoglycan</b> from simple epithelia has more and larger heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains than the <b>proteoglycan</b> from stratified epithelia. Thus, the cell surface <b>proteoglycan</b> shows a tissue-specific structural polymorphism due to distinct posttranslational modifications. This polymorphism likely reflects distinct <b>proteoglycan</b> functions in simple and stratified epithelia, potentially meeting the different adhesive requirements of the cells in these different organizations...|$|R
25|$|As {{noted in}} the above section, {{transforming}} growth factor-β2 (TGFβ2) is an important glial scar stimulant that directly affects astrocyte proliferation. Logan et al. developed monoclonal antibodies to TGFβ2, cerebral wounds were generated in rat brains, and the antibodies were administered via the ventricles, daily for 10 days. Subsequent analysis showed a marked reduction in glial scarring. Particularly, extracellular matrix protein deposition (laminin, fibronectin, and chondroitin sulfate <b>proteoglycans)</b> was closer to baseline (levels of protein expression in an uninjured animal). Further, a reduction in astrocytes and microglia, {{as well as a}} reduction in inflammation and angiogenesis, were observed.|$|E
25|$|The chondroitin sulfate <b>proteoglycans</b> phosphacan and neurocan {{have also}} been shown {{to play a role in}} glial scar. Phosphacan has been shown to have {{decreased}} levels in glial scar when compared to uninjured cortex. This decrease is beneficial to nerve generation because phosphacan has been shown to inhibit neurite extension similarly to the other CSPGs discussed already. Alternatively, neurocan production is up regulated in astrocytes in glial scar when compared to uninjured cortex and astrocytes in primary cell culture conditions. These elevated neurocan levels have been shown to remain elevated 30 days after the initial injury. This implicates neurocan as having a prolonged role in chronic scar.|$|E

Further, olomoucine has been shown to reduce neuronal cell death, reduce astroglial proliferation (and therefore reduce astrogliosis), and increase GAP-43 expression, a useful protein marker for neurite growth. Moreover, reduced astrocyte proliferation decreases expression of chondroitin sulfate <b>proteoglycans</b> (CSPGs), major extracellular matrix molecules associated with inhibition of neuroregneration after trauma to the CNS.|$|E

Where examined, syndecan-4 {{has been identified as}} the HSPG critical for CCN1 functions. The CYR61 binding sites for some of these integrins have been mapped (Figure 1). Due to the cell type specificity of integrin expression, CYR61 acts through distinct integrins to mediate specific functions in different types of cells. For example, CYR61 induces angiogenic functions in endothelial cells through αvβ3, and in fibroblasts promotes cellular senescence and enables TNFα to induce apoptosis through binding to α6β1-HSPGs. However, CYR61 supports cell adhesion through all of the integrins identified above.|$|E
25|$|The {{fibroblast}} {{growth factor}} (FGF) family with its prototype members FGF-1 (acidic FGF) and FGF-2 (basic FGF) consists to date {{of at least}} 22 known members.

In general, FGFs stimulate a variety of cellular functions by binding to cell surface FGF-receptors {{in the presence of}} heparin <b>proteoglycans.</b> The FGF-receptor family is composed of seven members, and all the receptor proteins are single-chain receptor tyrosine kinases that become activated through autophosphorylation induced by a mechanism of FGF-mediated receptor dimerization. Receptor activation gives rise to a signal transduction cascade that leads to gene activation and diverse biological responses, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and matrix dissolution, thus initiating a process of mitogenic activity critical for the growth of endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells.|$|E
25|$|Like the chondroitin sulfate <b>{{proteoglycan}}s,</b> keratan sulfate proteoglycan (KSPG) {{production is}} up regulated in reactive astrocytes {{as part of}} glial scar formation.

Keratan sulfate, also called keratosulfate, is formed from repeating disaccharide galactose units and N-acetylglucosamines. It is also 6-sulfated. This sulfation is crucial to the elongation of the keratan sulfate chain. A study was done using N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice. The wild type mouse showed a significant up regulation of mRNA expressing N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 at the site of cortical injury. However, in the N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice, the expression of keratan sulfate was significantly decreased when compared to the wild type mice. Similarly, glial scar formation was significantly reduced in the N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 mice, and as a result, nerve regeneration was less inhibited.|$|E

Collagen-associated and unbound <b>proteoglycan</b> {{was determined by}} enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after aggregation was complete. (1) The binding of <b>proteoglycan</b> to collagen {{could be explained by}} the presence of two mutually non-interacting binding sites, with Ka 1 = 1. 3 x 10 (8) M- 1 and Ka 2 = 1. 3 x 10 (6) M- 1. The number of binding sites per tropocollagen molecule was n 1 = 0. 11 and n 2 = 1. 1. The 0. 1 high-affinity binding site per tropocollagen molecule indicates that the strong {{interaction between}} <b>proteoglycan</b> and collagen results from a concerted action of tropocollagen molecules in fibrils. Digestion of the <b>proteoglycan</b> with chondroitinase ABC did not affect these binding characteristics. (2) <b>Proteoglycan</b> did not affect the rate of fibrillogenesis, but increased the steady-state A 400 by up to 90 %.

Unmodified HA has been used in clinical applications such as ocular surgery, wound healing, and plastic surgery. HA can be crosslinked to form hydrogels. HA hydrogels that were either unmodified or modified with laminin were implanted into an adult central nervous system lesion and tested for their ability to induce neural tissue formation in a study by Hou et al..
