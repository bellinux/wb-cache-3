5|$|A {{quarter of}} all people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} develop weakness of the breathing muscles leading to respiratory failure, the inability to breathe adequately to maintain healthy levels of oxygen and/or {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This life-threatening scenario is complicated by other medical <b>problems</b> <b>such</b> as pneumonia, severe infections, blood clots in the lungs and bleeding in the digestive tract in 60% of those who require artificial ventilation.|$|E
5|$|Behavioural {{interventions}} {{attempt to}} identify and reduce the antecedents and consequences of problem behaviours. This approach has not shown success in improving overall functioning, but can help to reduce some specific problem behaviours, such as incontinence.

However, these conventional methods cannot guarantee to find the global optimum because of the non-convex, non-differential and non-linear nature of the ORPD problem [6]. In the last decades, many evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been used for the ORPD <b>problem,</b> <b>such</b> as genetic algorithm (GA) [6], evolutionary programming (EP) [1].|$|R
5|$|Graham was at {{the centre}} of {{development}} across platforms, and {{had no problem with}} the Game Gear version having vehicle behaviour similar to the NES version. Routledge and Saunders came up with the method of multiplayer on the same device. Multiplayer via link-up was difficult to implement, with <b>problems</b> <b>such</b> as the game losing sync.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, oxygen {{has become}} {{available}} for recreational use in oxygen bars. The US Food and Drug Administration has warned those suffering from <b>problems</b> <b>such</b> as heart or lung disease {{not to use}} oxygen bars. Scuba divers use breathing gases containing up to 100% oxygen, and should have specific training in using such gases.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{new engine}} was plagued with <b>problems,</b> <b>such</b> as {{failure of the}} {{accessory}} gear trains and coolant jackets, and several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set. Early production Merlins were also unreliable: Common problems were cylinder head cracking, coolant leaks, and excessive wear to the camshafts and crankshaft main bearings.|$|E

The mortality rate for people who develop cerebral involvement is about 25%, and of those who survive who had lead encephalopathy symptoms by the time chelation therapy was begun, about 40% have permanent neurological <b>problems</b> <b>such</b> as cerebral palsy.|$|E
5|$|Plaque is a biofilm {{consisting}} of {{large quantities of}} various bacteria that form on teeth. If not removed regularly, plaque buildup can lead to periodontal <b>problems</b> <b>such</b> as gingivitis. Given time, plaque can mineralize along the gingiva, forming tartar. The microorganisms that form the biofilm are almost entirely bacteria (mainly streptococcus and anaerobes), with the composition varying by location in the mouth. Streptococcus mutans {{is the most important}} bacterium associated with dental caries.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia is {{a mental}} {{disorder}} characterized by abnormal social behavior {{and failure to}} understand what is real. Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not hear, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation. People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health <b>problems</b> <b>such</b> as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time.|$|E

A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive <b>problems,</b> <b>such</b> as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.|$|E
