30|$|The {{present study}} {{has sought to}} {{evaluate}} whether the information available in patent databases is harnessed by universities {{as a source of}} scientific and technological information, which, in consequence, could be useful in the preparation of doctoral research projects. We thus assessed whether students and their supervisors actually carried out the filing of patents for doctoral theses defended at the University. The research object were theses defended during 2010 to 2012 at the Post Graduate and Immunology Program - FMRP/USP. This program presents a significant number of scientific articles with a relevant impact value and as fulfilling the Capes 7 requirements. It was observed that only two of the theses used part or its whole knowledge protected by the <b>patent</b> <b>deposit.</b> In addition, excluding these cases, no other student who completed his doctorate during the analyzed period, had ownership of patent applications. The case scenario, therefore, is that few students develop projects with a view to introducing a new product, process or new technological application. This is {{due to a lack of}} interest in researchers to patent a discovery, and ended up failing to disseminate the findings only in scientific journals.|$|E
40|$|The {{empirical}} {{and theoretical}} justification of Gartner hype curves {{is a very}} relevant open question {{in the field of}} Technological Life Cycle analysis. The scope of the present paper is to introduce a simple model describing the growth of scientific/technological research impact, in the specific case where science is the main source of a new idea driving a technological development, leading to hype-type evolution curves. The main idea of the model is that, in a first stage, the growth of the scientific interest of a new specific field (as can be measured by publication numbers) basically follows the classical logistic growth curve. At a second stage, starting at a later trigger time, the technological development based on that scientific idea (as can be measured by patent deposits) can be described as the integral (in a mathematical sense) of the first curve, since technology is based on the overall accumulated scientific knowledge. The model is tested through a bibliometric analysis of the publication and <b>patent</b> <b>deposit</b> rate for Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLED) scientific research and technology, as well as for other emerging technologies.

This strain was {{deposited}} in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) since October 8, 1999, under the <b>patent</b> <b>deposit</b> designation number 55922. The bacterium was grown in T 3 broth at 30  °C to sporulation stage. The harvested cellular pellet of the culture containing mixture of spores and crystal toxin were used throughout the study. Crude Bt-C 18 spore-crystal complex was mixed with equal concentration of the black yeast melanin; these concentrations were 5, 10, and 15  ppm. Each of the mixtures was spread, as a thin film, on a glass plate (20 [*]×[*] 20  cm) and left exposed to the direct sun (in a mid-August day, 2017) from 9  am to 3  pm, to get maximum exposure to UV. A non-melanin crude Bt-C 18 spore-crystal complex (control) was exposed to the direct sun in the same manner. Second instar larvae of S. littoralis were fed on an artificial diet supplied with either 5, 10, or 15  ppm of the sun-exposed Bt spore-crystal complexes with or without melanin (Osman et al. 2014).

40|$|Calorimetry {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{solutions}} to estimate the overall quantity of nuclear material on a wide range of masses, from a few milligrams up to kilograms of radionuclides, by measuring the overall thermal power due to the radioactive decay coming from the waste contained in a metallic drum or a different type of container. It has many advantages as it features a non-destructive method which remains independent of matrix effect or the chemical composition. Until now, calorimetry allows to measure at the lowest 0. 5 to 1 mW for samples up to 385 liters. But nowadays, thanks to new technological breakthroughs, KEP-Technologies calorimeters are able to measure as low as 50 μW for 40 liters samples. The μLVC is based on a new design with twin cells, a new temperature regulation loop and a heat-flow measurement system inside a vacuum chamber (<b>Patent</b> <b>deposit</b> P 005299 LA/VL). The μLVC is a differential heat-flow calorimeter for precise measurement independent of the residual fluctuations caused by environmental changes. The new calorimeter is an industrial product able to work in environmental conditions with wide temperature variations. The first results have shown a great improvement in the detection of very low thermal effect thanks to the thermal noise reduction.

30|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the importance of protecting the knowledge generated by the university through patents, and assess the use of information available in patent database {{as a source of}} scientific and technological information. To this end, the doctoral theses defended in 2010 to 2012  year at the Basic and Applied Immunology FMRP/USP Post Graduation Program, were evaluated considering patent applications by the authors involved, as well as by other national/international unrelated research groups. The data showed that only 8 % of the thesis (two) had its results added to a patent filing. Moreover, no other student was found to held a patent resulting in other researches, and also, a few supervisors are researchers who held authored/co-authored of patent filling. When we assessed if theses’ results and applications had been patented by other groups not related to the thesis group, it was noted that there was no record of patent filling in 46 % of theses, and in this group, it was included researches with strong potential for patentability, but the authors didn’t applied for a <b>patent</b> <b>deposit.</b> The remaining 54 %, representing 14 theses, had part or the whole knowledge disclosed in patents documents, five of these were specific about the topic and the results of the thesis, presuming that there was a likely duplicity {{in the development of the}} research. We can conclude that the study was once repeated since no searching for information in patents databases were properly performed as reference source in the development phase of their research projects. The results of this research indicates that the use of patents database, as a source of technological information by the universities is an urgent requirement, since represent a rich scientific information bank that should be aggregated with the information available in papers to conduct innovative research.|$|E

Cost of production of 1 kg of earthworm biomass through bed culture is about 3. 6 Euro, much lower than the cost of hand collection of worms from pastures/grasslands where these species are abundant (6 - 125 Euro depending on the cost of labour and earthworm density). The theorical value of an active earthworm community with an average biomass of 400 kg live wt has been estimated at 1400 Euro, the price that it would cost to reintroduce an equivalent biomass produced in our culture units, indicating the cost of land restoration. Direct inoculation of earthworms in the field to improve production may only affect plant growth positively if a large biomass (greater than 30 g live wt/m 2) is inoculated from the beginning.

40|$|Abstract Culture {{collections}} {{have the}} crucial role of providing the authenticated biological material upon which high quality research is based. Importantly, they serve as repositories for strains as part of <b>patent</b> <b>deposits,</b> providers of safe and confidential services to store key organisms for research and industry, and sources of organisms cited in scientific papers {{that can be used}} in the confirmation of results and for further study. The demands upon culture collections change as new technologies and uses of organisms are discovered. Many are becoming Biological Resource Centres, as defined by the OECD Biological Resource Centre (BRC) Initiative, in that they operate according to international quality criteria, carry out essential research, enhance the value and applications of strains and provide a vital information resource. In a changing international sci-entific environment, many collections are under threat of extinction because of inadequate funding, changing government support strategies and the cost of new technologies. We are also suffering a decline in the number of biosystematists, who are needed to form a sound base for molecular technologies and to aid in identifying, and characterizing microbial diversity. In this environment, collections must work together to make the best use of new technologies and to contribute to the description of the 1. 4 million fungi yet to be dis-covered. At the current rate, this will take 700 years. New technologies and novel ways of funding this task must be engaged and, above all, scientists must collab-orate.

The paper looks at the available options for the connection of power plants to the existing extra high voltage transmission grid taking into account investment, operation and maintenance and environmental costs, identifying the best solution {{as a function of}} the land value. Three different technical solutions are compared: •	overhead lines, •	cable lines; •	gas insulated lines. Overhead lines are the traditional technology with few innovative solutions. High voltage cables made a breakthrough with the {{introduction of}} XLPE insulation reducing dramatically the losses and improving the life duration of dielectric. Gas Insulated Lines (GIL), even if rely on a technology that dates back in the seventies and eighties when most of the related <b>patents</b> were <b>deposited</b> in Europe and the USA, show brilliant performances when the reduction of electromagnetic field has to be achieved. While overhead lines have a low investment cost, cables and GIL can eliminate the visual impact.

Today, virtually all digital electronics use CMOS circuitry. Bernard worked at Fairchild Semiconductor in Silicon Valley from 1958 ( [...] he was employee number 158 [...] ), through the buyouts of the company by Schlumberger and National Semiconductor, and finally retiring in 1990. In the 1960s Fairchild Semiconductor, a division of Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp., and Texas Instruments, revolutionized electronics by employing the first integrated circuit technology. Fairchild's Robert Noyce [...] filed for this <b>patent</b> using <b>deposited</b> (printed) metal lines and Jean Hoerni's Planar Process ( [...] patent also filed by Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments but with using bonding wires [...] ). At the time virtually all the devices were of the bipolar type which were used to construct RTL and DTL type circuits ( [...] Resistor-Transistor-Logic, Diode-Transistor-Logic), which unfortunately drew more power than was desired, and eventually lost ground to Texas Instruments' TTL (Transistor-Transistor-logic). The next great technological leap in computer chips would be CMOS transistors, which promised significantly lower power and greater circuit density than the Bipolar circuitry. Although Frank Wanlass first filed for the CMOS patent in 1963, Fairchild could not produce the devices for commercial output for many years because of the mystery of the mobile ions degrading their performance. Much research time and money was expended in 1967 and 1968 at Fairchild on trying to manufacture the highly promising technology, the MOS SGT ( [...] Metal Oxide Semiconductor Silicon Gate Technology [...] ) circuits utilizing the field effect from the [...] "gate" [...] on the conducting [...] "channel" [...] from source to drain.|$|R

In particular, coatings constituted by different amounts of SiC and MoSi 2 particles dispersed in a ZrB 2 matrix were produced and tested. Oxidation resistance and mechanical tests were carried out. Results showed that MoSi 2 addition improves oxidation resistance with respect to ZrB 2 - SiC samples, without affecting mechanical properties. Demonstrative components were manufactured and tested {{by means of a}} plasma wind tunnel in simulated operative conditions. Preliminary results showed that thermal sprayed ceramics are well suited to be used as thermal protection systems in space re-entry vehicles.

40|$|Blood is {{a common}} type of medium with which <b>patent</b> {{fingerprints}} are <b>deposited</b> at crime scenes. Chemical enhancements are generally used on bloody fingerprints when some type of pattern is visible but ridge characteristics are not sufficiently defined to make the print suitable for comparison. Motor vehicles, which {{may be associated with}} crimes scenes or forensic investigations, can be exposed to a variety of contaminants from the environment, including mud, salt, pollen, dust and motor oil, {{as well as from the}} application of chemicals to protect the paint such as car wax and car polish. It is unknown if these contaminants in combination with the chemicals used to enhance bloody impressions or in combination with the blood itself, could impact the enhancement of bloody impressions found on vehicles. This study seeks to assess the effectiveness of a selection of blood enhancement methods in the presence of such contaminants. Three of the four enhancement chemicals that were tested, Amido Black, Hungarian Red, and Leucocrystal Violet, were determined to be similarly effective for the enhancement of bloody friction ridge patterns applied to the surfaces of contaminated glass and metal substrates...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, the design and {{manufacture}} of nanostructured materials has been of tremendous interest to the scientific community for their application in the biomedical field. Among the available techniques, layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly has attracted considerable attention as a convenient method to fabricate functional coatings. Nowadays, more than 1000 scientific papers are published every year, tens of <b>patents</b> have been <b>deposited</b> and some commercial products based on LBL technology have become commercially available. LBL presents several advantages, such as (1) : a precise control of the coating properties; (2) environmentally friendly, mild conditions and low-cost manufacturing; (3) versatility for coating all available surfaces; (4) obtainment of homogeneous film with controlled thickness; and (5) incorporation and controlled release of biomolecules/drugs. This paper critically reviews the scientific challenge of the last 10 years—functionalizing biomaterials by LBL to obtain appropriate properties for biomedical applications, in particular in tissue engineering (TE). The analysis of the state-of-the-art highlights the current techniques and the innovative materials for scaffold and medical device preparation that are opening {{the way for the}} preparation of LBLfunctionalized substrates capable of modifying their surface properties for modulating cell interaction to improve substitution, repair or enhancement of tissue functio...|$|R
