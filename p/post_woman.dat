Joshua is {{a son of a}} famous photographer Peter George (Mohanlal) and Saira was his adopted child. Unexpected death of the photographer made Saira a mother to his Son. The duo share a mother-son unique bond. Joshua gets scapegoated in a case where there are chances he might face life imprisonment and Saira tries to help him.

Essa no????o se refere a uma transforma????o {{cultural}} que est?? ocorrendo no mundo das mulheres (TOURAINE, 2007) devido a um processo de satura????o de outro aspecto cultural, a hegemonia masculina. ?? medida que a noite foi vista como um laborat??rio sociocultural dessa outra mulher, percebemos que na sociedade contempor??nea, com o decl??nio da "mulher para o outro" e a entrada da "mulher para si" (TOURAINE, 2007), estamos assistindo a emerg??ncia da p??s-mulher que, ao usar da produ????o corporal como instrumento de sedu????o (BAUDRILLARD, 1991) e coquetismo (SIMMEL, 2008 c), tamb??m exerce rela????es de domina????o feminina (BAUDRILLARD, 1991).

This notion refers to a cultural transformation that is happening in the ???woman world??? (TOURAINE, 2007) due to a saturation process of another cultural aspect, the male hegemony. As the night was seen as a sociocultural laboratory of this another woman, we notice that in contemporary society, with the decline of ???the woman for the another??? and the entry of ???the woman for herself??? (TOURAINE, 2007), we are witnessing the emergence of the pos woman that, by using the body production as instrument of seduction (BAUDRILLARD, 1991) and coquetry (SIMMEL, 2008 c), also exerts relations of ???female domination??? (BAUDRILLARD, 1991). After going to field and conducting some semi-structured interviews, we noted that it is not possible for us to analyze the female body construction phenomenon only from the idea that the women produce themselves by and for the way other look at them (BOURDIEU, 1999).

How pre- and postmenopausal age (PRE, POST), estradiol (E 2) availability, and abdominal visceral fat (AVF) jointly affect peptidyl-secretagogue drive of GH secretion is not known. To this end, healthy PRE (n = 20) and POST (n = 22) women underwent a low- vs. high-E 2 clamp before receiving a continuous intravenous infusion of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) or GH-releasing peptide (GHRP- 2). According to analysis of covariance, PRE and <b>POST</b> <b>women</b> achieved age-independent hypo- and euestrogenemia under respective low- and high-E 2 clamps. All four of age (P < 0. 001), E 2 status (P = 0. 006), secretagogue type (P < 0. 001), and an age × peptide interaction (P = 0. 014) controlled pulsatile GH secretion. Independently of E 2 status, <b>POST</b> <b>women</b> had lower GH responses to both GHRH (P = 0. 028) and GHRP- 2 (P < 0. 001) than PRE women. Independently of age, GHRP- 2 was more stimulatory than GHRH during low E 2 (P = 0. 011) and high E 2 (P < 0. 001). Stepwise forward-selection multivariate analysis revealed that computerized tomographic estimates of AVF explained 22 % of the variability in GHRH action (P = 0. 002), whereas age and E 2 together explained 60 % of the variability in GHRP- 2 drive (P < 0. 001). These data establish that age, estrogen status, and AVF are triple covariates of continuous peptide-secretagogue drive of pulsatile GH secretion in women.

40|$|Biochemical {{markers of}} bone {{resorption}} {{can be used}} clinically to predict the risk of osteoporosis-related fractures (prognostic tool) and to assess the response of an osteoporotic patient to an antiresorptive therapy (monitoring tool). Our aim {{was to assess the}} ability of four currently marketed biochemical markers of bone resorption, based on the measurement of degradation products from collage type I telopeptides to monitor the elevated resorption associated with menopause. Women (846) were stratified for menopause, age, and bone mineral density and the following markers were measured: urinary cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTx), the levels of breakdown products of type I collagen C-telopeptides in serum (S-CTx), and in urine, by ELISA (U-CTx-E), and RIA (U-CTx-R). Furthermore, the ratio (a/b) between the aL form of CTx measured in the CTx RIA and the bL form measured in the ELISA was calculated. The mean difference was calculated for each marker in women with osteopenia (Op) or osteoporosis (PMO) (WHO definition) compared with healthy premenopausal (Pre) women and postmenopausal (N <b>Post)</b> <b>women</b> with normal bone mass. Serum CTx showed the highest elevation in post- compared with premenopausal women. All marker values were significantly higher in Op and PMO subjects compared with both Pre and to N <b>Post</b> <b>women.</b> Compared with premenopausal values, the largest elevation in both Op and PMO women was observed for serum CTx. Compared with N Post, urine NTx showed the highest increase in OP subjects.

In conclusion, postmenopausal women showed elevated turnover with all bone resorption markers, but with substantial individual variation in resorption levels. Furthermore, the turnover process in postmenopausal women appears to be quantitatively different from the premenopausal stage, apparent as altered a/b CTx ratios. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} a leading cancer among women today. Mastectomy {{is one of the}} most common paths for breast cancer {{prevention}} and treatment. However, this treatment path can cause noticeable body changes around the woman’s bust area. Recently more and more <b>post</b> mastectomy <b>women</b> are deciding to live without breast reconstruction surgery. This decision referred to as “going flat” or “living flat. ” Due to the changed bodies and a lack of information on functional and aesthetic concerns related to clothing, clothing selection becomes difficult for <b>post</b> mastectomy <b>women</b> who choose to “live flat. ” The purpose of this study was to create two new fitting (no dart and one waist dart) blocks for <b>post</b> mastectomy <b>women</b> after exploring the clothing preferences, demands, and clothing expenses of post double mastectomy female participants in a Social media organization. An online survey was created and applied to collect information such as their geographic location, post-surgery clothing and body sizes, clothing and fabric preferences, and clothing expenses statistics. A total of 95 <b>post</b> double mastectomy <b>women</b> who choose to “live flat” participated in the survey. There were 89 participants who had double mastectomy surgery, and six participants who had single mastectomy. Based on the findings, most mastectomy survivors changed their clothing style after mastectomy surgery. There are many types of clothing they could not wear any more since their body shape changed. In order to meet their clothing fitting and aesthetic demands, two new blocks have been made. The researcher also provides the steps of making the no dart and one waist dart blocks. Although there are different types of breast cancer survivors, the new blocks were only focused on <b>post</b> double mastectomy <b>women</b> in this study.
