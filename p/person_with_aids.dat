500|$|In 1983, two {{separate}} research groups led by Robert Gallo and Luc Montagnier independently declared that a novel retrovirus {{may have been}} infecting AIDS patients, and published their findings {{in the same issue}} of the journal Science.

Gallo's group called their newly isolated virus HTLV-III. [...] At the same time, Montagnier's group isolated a virus from a patient presenting with swelling of the lymph nodes of the neck and physical weakness, two classic symptoms of AIDS. Contradicting the report from Gallo's group, Montagnier and his colleagues showed that core proteins of this virus were immunologically different from those of HTLV-I. [...] Montagnier's group named their isolated virus lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV). As these two viruses {{turned out to be the}} same, in 1986 LAV and HTLV-III were renamed HIV.|$|E

40|$|As was {{explained}} {{earlier in this}} memorandum, bearing aids for the eligible classes are available only to a limited extent at present and are only given to certain priority groups. This {{is because of the}} need to deploy the limited resources and facilities to the ·best advantage. The aids are costly and it is important to ensure that <b>persons</b> supplied <b>with</b> <b>aids</b> are properly fitted and instructed in their use. The establishment of the hearing aid service by the National Organisation for Rehabilitation should permit of a considerable expansion, at reasonable cost, in the supply of aids to eligible persons. The assessment of deafness, particularly in school children and children of pre-school age attending child welfare clinics, will be greatly improved by examination by the public health nurses who have attended the courses in audiometry.

Environmental {{perception}} is a functional {{area that is}} severely limited in <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> deafblindness (DB) who belong a category of people with severe disabilities. Monitor is a vibratory <b>aid</b> developed <b>with</b> the aim to improve environmental perception of <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> DB. The <b>aid</b> consists of a mobile phone with an application connected to a microphone and vibrator. Monitor picks up the sounds produced by events by microphone, processes the sound using an algorithm programmed as an application in the mobile phone and then presents the signal via the vibrator to the <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> DB to be sensed and interpreted. In previous laboratory studies, four algorithms (AM, AMMC, TR, and TRHA) were developed based on modulating, and transposing principles. The algorithms were tested by <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> normal hearing/hearing impairment and selected as good candidates to improve vibratory identification of environmental sounds. In this on-going the algorithms are tested by 13 <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> congenital D and five <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> DB using Monitor in a realistic environment, living room, kitchen or office.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a system for}} accommodating active listening for <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> hearing <b>aids</b> or cochlear implants, with a special focus on children with complex needs, for instance {{at an early stage}} of cognitive development and with additional physical disabilities.

The Soundscraper has been tested with 25 children with good results. An increased attention span was reported, as well as surprising and positive reactions from children where the caregivers were unsure whether they could hear at all. The sound generating models, the sensors and the parameter mapping were simple, but provided a controllable and complex enough sound environment even with limited interaction. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{essay is}} {{about the history of}} the hearing aid in Sweden, from 1930 s until today. The hearing aid as an {{apparatus}} is described, and views by the users are presented. Articles and interviews have been used as source material to answer the main questions. In the essay, people who have written the articles, and the ten users being interviewed, describe how hearing aids are used in everyday life, and how users interact with people in general and how the hearing care system treats users. Another question regards how users perceive their own hearing aids from an aesthetic perspective. The articles are collected from a member-paper for people who have a hearing-loss. The articles were published between 1943 and 1960. The result is that these users are quite comfortable <b>with</b> their hearing <b>aids.</b> This result is also contradictory to the general view of a person who has a hearing loss.

40|$|Introduction: My name is Jordan Poortenga and I am {{applying}} to present my {{research in the}} Butler Undergraduate Research Conference for April 2014. I worked as a research analyst with Advancement Associates, Inc to evaluate open ended questions. The research objective is to highlight the importance of utilizing quantitative and qualitative data to better support a research conclusion. The research topic was to evaluate the charitable disposition of persons under the age forty. Data was taken from an international survey conducted by Advancement Associates, Inc. to evaluate constituency members of the Mennonite Central Committee USA and Canada {{in the last five}} years. The three research questions for this project are: 1) What are the charitable interests of people under forty? 2) What are the preferred communication mediums of persons under the age of forty? 3) Is there market potential for people under the age of forty to support the Mennonite Central Committee and how best to build relationships with younger constituency members to gain their support Process: Research was collected via Survey Monkey survey and traditional mail. Objective question structures utilized a variety of scaling approaches. Data was analyzed in SPSS using t-tests, Anova and Tukey tests, as well as any other sample testing that was required for data evaluation. Open ended questions were summarized in Excel, coded, and evaluated based on frequency of drivers to derive trends in responses. The two types of data findings were then compared to help create a stronger research conclusion.
