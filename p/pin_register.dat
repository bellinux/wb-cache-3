The Alex Jovy film was produced at Wave Pictures' digital intermediate film facility in London, England. It was scanned at 2K resolution with 8 bits color depth per color / per pixel using a <b>pin</b> <b>registered,</b> liquid gate Oxberry 6400 Motion Picture Film Scanner and recorded onto Kodak 5242 color intermediate stock using MGI Celco Cine V Film Recorders. Digital visual effects and color correction were done using a Discreet Logic Inferno. Sorted premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2000.|$|R
25|$|For {{the thermal}} vision, {{infrared}} film {{could not be}} used because it did not register in the range of body temperature wavelengths. The filmmakers used an inframetrics thermal video scanner as it gave good heat images of objects and people. The glowing blood was achieved by green liquid from glow sticks used by campers and mixed with personal lubricant for texture. The electrical sparks were rotoscoped animation using white paper <b>pin</b> <b>registered</b> on portable light tables to black-and-white prints of the film frames. The drawings were composited by the optical crew for the finished effects. Additional visual effects, mainly for the opening title sequence of the Predator arriving on Earth, were supplied by Dream Quest Images (later Oscar-winners for their work on The Abyss and Total Recall). The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Visual Effects.|$|R
30|$|As {{long as the}} {{connections}} between elements (I/O <b>pin</b> to <b>register)</b> remain short enough and with small length dispersion {{to stay within the}} clock sampling time window, it is possible to implement a standard synchronous pipeline architecture. The pins transmission directly to an input register helps to maximize the timing performance and allows faster setup times.|$|R

50|$|R/Greenberg Associates {{created the}} film's optical effects, {{including}} the creature's ability to become invisible, its thermal vision point-of-view, its glowing blood, and the electric spark effects. The invisibility effect {{was achieved by}} having someone in a bright red suit (because it was the farthest opposite of the green of the jungle and {{the blue of the}} sky) the size of the creature. The take was then repeated without the actors using a 30% wider lens on the camera. When the two takes were combined optically, a vague outline of the alien could be seen with the background scenery bending around its shape. For the thermal vision, infrared film could not be used because it did not register in the range of body temperature wavelengths. The glowing blood was achieved by green liquid from chem-lite sticks used by campers. The electrical sparks were rotoscoped animation using white paper <b>pin</b> <b>registered</b> on portable light tables to black-and-white prints of the film frames.

40|$|Fast and {{powerful}} networks {{are becoming more}} popular on clusters to support applications including message passing, file systems, and databases. These networks require special treatment by the operating system to obtain high throughput and low latency. In particular, application memory must be <b>pinned</b> and <b>registered</b> in advance of use. However, popular communication libraries such as MPI have interfaces {{that do not require}} explicit registration calls from the user, thus the libraries must manage this aspect themselves...|$|R
40|$|The CAT 3211 is an H−Bridge {{motor driver}} IC that {{includes}} an I 2 C programmable haptic generator state machine, internal oscillator and adjustable LDO voltage regulator, {{all in one}} compact solution. Two operating modes are supported: haptic mode (triggered via H_TRIG <b>pin</b> or <b>register)</b> and vibrator mode (VIB_EN <b>pin</b> or <b>register).</b> H−TRIG triggers a haptic sequence where Forward, Coast, Reverse and Recovery time durations are controlled. All four timer durations are configured via I 2 C interface registers. The LDO output voltage supplying the H−Bridge can be programmed from 2. 0 V to 5. 0 V or shorted to VIN (using LDOH register). This allows the motor to be safely overdriven for short durations, greatly increasing the user experience. Driving VIB_EN high sets the H−Bridge to forward direction and LDO voltage to a predefined vibrator setting (using LDOV register). The motor can be continuously and safely driven at low voltages in vibrator mode. The device is fully protected against POS, NEG and REG short and over current conditions. Thermal shutdown protection prevents damage to the device and system during over temperature junction conditions. UQFN 12 1. 7 x 2 mm package is ideal for space constrained applications...|$|R

50|$|Just {{as with a}} {{standard}} motion picture camera, the intermittent <b>register</b> <b>pin</b> camera actually stops the film in the film gate while the photograph is being taken. In high-speed photography, this requires some modifications to the mechanism for achieving this intermittent motion at such high speeds. In all cases, a loop is formed {{before and after the}} gate to create and then take up the slack. Pulldown claws, which enter the film through perforations, pulling it into place and then retracting out of the perforations and out of the film gate, are multiplied to grab the film through multiple perforations in the film, thereby reducing the stress that any individual perforation is subjected to. <b>Register</b> <b>pins,</b> which secure the film through perforations in final position while it is being exposed, after the pulldown claws are retracted are also multiplied, and often made from exotic materials. In some cases, vacuum suction is used to keep the film, especially 35 mm and 70 mm film, flat so that the images are in focus across the entire frame.|$|R

5000|$|Konvas {{cameras are}} reflex, using a {{spinning}} mirrored shutter, allowing the operator {{to view the}} scene through the main lens during filming. Because of the camera's movement mechanism, the shutter opening is 155° {{as opposed to the}} 180° which is standard on many other cameras. Consequently, the shutter speed is slightly higher, for which the exposure must be compensated from the usual 24fps frames per second light meter setting by 1/3 of an f/stop. It has an extended dwell time for film transport like in ARRI 35 series, thus provides more steadiness despite it has no <b>register</b> <b>pin.</b> Some models including -2M and 8M accept a single OCT-19 mount lens, others have a three lens turret including -1M and 7M.|$|R
40|$|In the unlubricated sliding wear of steels the mild-severe and severe-mild wear {{transitions}} {{have long}} been investigated. The effect of system inputs such as normal load, sliding speed, environment humidity and temperature, material properties, among others, on those transitions have also been studied. Although transitions seem {{to be caused by}} microstructural changes, surfaces oxidation and work-hardening, some questions remain regarding the way each aspect is involved. Since the early studies in sliding wear, it has usually been assumed that only the material properties of the softer body influence the wear behavior of contacting surfaces. For example, the Archard equation involves only the hardness of the softer body, without considering the hardness of the harder body. This work aims to discuss the importance of the harder body hardness in determining the wear regime operation. For this, pin-on-disk wear tests were carried out, in which the disk material was always harder than the pin material. Variations of the friction force and vertical displacement of the <b>pin</b> were <b>registered</b> during the tests. A material characterization before and after tests was conducted using stereoscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methods, in addition to mass loss, surface roughness and microhardness measurements. The wear results confirmed the occurrence of a mild-severe wear transition when the disk hardness was decreased. The disk hardness to pin hardness ratio (H(d) /H(p)) was used as a criterion to establish the nature of surface contact deformation and to determine the wear regime transition. A predominantly elastic or plastic contact, characterized by H(d) /H(p) values higher or lower than one, results in a mild or severe wear regime operation, respectively. (c) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The NCT 72 is a dual−channel digital {{thermometer}} and undertemperature/overtemperature alarm, {{intended for use}} in PCs and thermal management systems. It is <b>pin</b> and <b>register</b> compatible with the NCT 1008 but the NCT 72 allows the user to pull the ALERT pin to 1. 8 V without increasing the device Idd. A feature of the NCT 72 is series resistance cancellation, where up to 1. 5 k � (typical) of resistance in series with the temperature monitoring diode can be automatically cancelled from the temperature result, allowing noise filtering. The NCT 72 has a configurable ALERT output and an extended, switchable temperature measurement range. The NCT 72 can measure the temperature of a remote thermal diode accurate to ± 1 °C and the ambient temperature accurate to ± 3 °C. The temperature measurement range defaults to 0 °C to + 127 °C, compatible with the NCT 1008, {{but it can be}} switched to a wider measurement range of − 64 °C to + 191 °C. The NCT 72 communicates over a 2 −wire serial interface, compatible with system management bus (SMBus/I 2 C) standards. The default SMBus/I 2 C address of the NCT 72 is 0 x 4 C. An NCT 72 D is available with an SMBus/I 2 C address of 0 x 4 D. This is useful if more than one NCT 72 is used on the same SMBus/I 2 C. An ALERT output signals when the on−chip or remote temperature is out of range. The THERM output is a comparator output that allows on/off control of a cooling fan. The ALERT output can be reconfigured as a second THERM output, if required...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{details the}} motivation, design and {{implementation}} of a new back-end for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler which uses the Low Level Virtual Machine compiler infrastructure for code generation. Haskell as implemented by GHC was found to map remarkably well onto the LLVM Assembly language, although some new approaches were required. The most notable of these being {{the use of a}} custom calling convention in order to implement GHC’s optimisation feature of <b>pinning</b> STG virtual <b>registers</b> to hardware registers. In the evaluation of the LLVM back-end in regards to GHC’s C and native code generator back-end, the LLVM back-end was found to offer comparable results in regards to performance in most situations with the surprising finding that LLVM’s optimisations didn’t offer any improvement to the run-time of the generated code. The complexity of the LLVM back-end proved to be far simpler though then either the native code generator or C back-ends and as such it offers a compelling primary back-end target for GHC.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} ongoing work on {{an advanced}} flexible circuit interconnect substrate featuring a 24 x 24 (576 element) pad grid array pattern at 300 micron pitch. This eight metal layer circuit is being developed as a highdensity, pixel-level interconnection substrate for a two-dimensional (2 D) ultrasound imaging transducer MEMS device. The flexible circuit substrate is constructed using laminate fabrication methods, whereby multiple sets of two-sided metallized and patterned 1 mil polyimide circuit pairs are laminated together using dielectric adhesive sheets to form a multilayer structure. UV laser-drilled via-in-pad blind vias are used to connect buried trace elements in the circuit stack to the array pattern on the top surface. The flex circuit has feature patterns as small as 35 µm traces and spaces. The UV laser (Electro Scientific Industries, Portland, OR) is used in several other process steps to fabricate the multilayer device including patterning precisely <b>registered</b> <b>pin</b> alignment features in the circuit pairs. Construction of the multilayer device is also possible using advanced substrate materials with improved electrical performance characteristics, including laminate materials such as liquid crystal polymers (LCPs). LCP substrates have a significantly lower dielectric constant, improved dimensional stability and lower TCE compared to polyimide. Although being developed {{as part of an}} ultrasound transducer imaging array project, the advanced substrate has wide applicability to new chip-scale packaging and MEMS electronic integration efforts...|$|R
