New planting of Robusta coffee BP 42 x BP 358 was used with Randomized Complete Block Design and 3 replications.

40|$|Objective: This study aims to {{investigate}} the effects of CDKN 2 <b>A</b> (<b>p</b> 16 INK 4 A/p 14 ARF) over-expression on the proliferation and migration of human melanoma A 375 cells. Methods: Melanoma tissues and pigmented nevi tissues were collected. Human melanoma A 375 cells were transfected by CDKN 2 <b>A</b> (<b>p</b> 16 INK 4 A) and CDKN 2 <b>A</b> (<b>p</b> 14 ARF) over-expressing vectors and then assigned into blank, negative control (NC), p 16 INK 4 <b>A</b> and <b>p</b> 14 ARF groups. The expression of CDKN 2 <b>A</b> (<b>p</b> 16 INK 4 A) and CDKN 2 <b>A</b> (<b>p</b> 14 ARF) mRNA and protein was detected by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. CCK- 8, flow cytometry and Transwell assays were applied to observe cell proliferation, the cell cycle and apoptosis, and migration and invasion, respectively. The model of subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice was established to measure cell growth in vivo. Results: Compared with pigmented nevi tissues, CDKN 2 <b>A</b> (<b>p</b> 16 INK 4 A) and CDKN 2 <b>A</b> (<b>p</b> 14 ARF) mRNA and protein expression were significantly decreased in melanoma tissues. CDKN 2 <b>A</b> (<b>p</b> 16 INK 4 A) and CDKN 2 <b>A</b> (<b>p</b> 14 ARF) over-expression inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and progression from G 0 /G 1 to S phase of A 375 cells and xenograft tumor growth, but promoted apoptosis.

40|$|International audienceSolvent {{effects have}} been {{investigated}} {{for the last four}} decades. As far as we know, only 3 articles have reported on the solvent effect with beta-phosphorylated nitroxides. In 1976, Il'Yasov and coll. (Theor Exp Chem 12 : 656, 1976) showed in 16 solvents that the phosphorus hyperfine coupling constant <b>a</b> (<b>P)</b> linearly decreased with the polarity of the solvent given by the normalized Reichardt-Dimroth polarity constant E (N) (T) for in situ generated nitroxides, e. g., from <b>a</b> (<b>P)</b> = 40. 80 G in n-hexane (E (T) (N) = 0. 09) to <b>a</b> (<b>P)</b> = 22. 80 G in water (E (T) (N) = 1). A few years later, Janzen and coll. (Magn Reson Chem 37 : 251 - 258, 1999) reported a weak (around 4 G) decrease in <b>a</b> (<b>P)</b> for <b>a</b> few beta-phosphorylated nitroxides in n-hexane and methanol.

In this article, we report the solvent effect in 40 solvents on two new nitroxides and discuss at the light of the results reported in the literature. It turns out that <b>a</b> (<b>P)</b> changes obey no trends, i. e., strong or weak decrease, no change or even a weak increase in <b>a</b> (<b>P)</b> was observed depending on the structure of each nitroxide...|$|R
