40|$|Abstract Pugionium (Brassicaceae) {{is a small}} Central-Asian endemic genus {{with four}} {{tentative}} species described before. All of them grow in the desert habitat and have been considered as important <b>psammophytes</b> for evolu-tionary studies and ecological restorations. However, the wild resources of these species have been declined because of overexploitation. In this study, 12 polymorphic micro-satellite loci {{have been developed for}} P. dolabratum Maxim, and the performance of primer pairs amplifying these loci in related three species has also been tested. The number of alleles in 18 individuals from 13 geographically distant populations ranged from three to seven per locus. The observed and expected heterozygosities varied from 0. 17 to 0. 30 and from 0. 32 to 0. 48, respectively. We further performed cross-priming tests in the remaining three spe-cies of this genus, P. cornutum, P. calcaratum and P. cristatum.

40|$|Plant {{communities}} of coastal dunes are distributed along a characteristic sea-inland gradient. Generally, {{there is a}} shift from annual and short height species with small leaves in initial successional stages to perennial tall shrubs with tough leaves in later phases. Assessing the community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values is used in plant ecology to describe ecosystem properties especially during succession. In particular, CSR (Competitive, Stress-tolerant, and Ruderal strategy) classification allows us to explore community functional shifts in terms of disturbance, stress and competition selective forces. To explore the functional basis of the psammophilous succession, we asked the following questions: (1) Can we circumscribe different functional types among plant species of Mediterranean coastal dunes? (2) How do CWM trait values vary along the environmental sea-inland gradient? (3) What is {{the relative importance of}} competition, stress and disturbance in the processes of plant community assembling? (4) Can we postulate that along primary successions there is generally a shift from ruderality to stress-tolerance? An explorative analysis of functional groups was performed by Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) analysing nine morpho-functional traits measured for 45 taxa from 880 dune plots localised in Tuscany (central Italy, Europe). NMDS ordination showed a scattered distribution of <b>psammophytes</b> that could not be delimited in sharp plant functional types. The first NMDS axis has been interpreted as a leaf economics axis because it was correlated to leaf area (LA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC), while the second one was a plant size axis because of its correlation with canopy height. Along the sea-inland gradient, pioneer plant {{communities of}} upper beach were dominated by ruderals (with the lowest values of LDMC and specific leaf area - SLA), well-adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of coastal dunes. More distantly from the sea, where ecological conditions were less extreme, late-successional communities of backdunes were characterised by the prevalence of stress-tolerants. This study suggested that <b>psammophytes</b> have evolved not a single but multiple adaptive strategies showing a high degree of functional diversity and complexity. Moreover, CSR classification supported the hypothesis of a functional shift from R-strategists in early successional stages to S-strategists in late-successional communities along a primary succession...|$|R

40|$|Sandy coasts are {{distributed}} worldwide {{and they are}} all heterogeneous ecosystems in terms of morphology, vegetation, and dynamics. <b>Psammophytes</b> are common in these environments. Besides these widespread attributes, sandy beaches and coastal dunes also share the intense impact of humans. Because of their privileged location at the coast, they are preferred sites for urban and maritime development, destinations for tourists, and locations for many other human activities. Thus, over the years (but especially during the last few decades) many of the previously natural dunescapes have been lost to urban, tourist, and industrial developments. Furthermore, a recurring problem of many coastal dune systems is over-stabilization, which is mostly the result of human actions. The urgent need to preserve the natural and valuable coastal dune remnants and, as much as possible, restore those that have been degraded, is evident. There are many different and contrasting actions that have been followed during restoration activities. Restoration actions have involved “soft” methods, such as sand fences, and “hard” methods, such as geotubes and herbicides. Also, restoration may lead not only to the stabilization of dunes, but also to the re-mobilization of sand. On n overcrowded planet where the coasts are ecosystems to which humans gravitate, conservation and restoration actions become exponentially important...|$|R

Experiments were conducted {{to determine the effects}} of light intensity, constant temperature, alternating temperatures, and water potential on germination to determine why air-dispersed achenes fail to germinate well in the field. Achenes germinated within a wide alternating temperature window, except under the 5 : 15 °C (night:day) temperature regime in darkness. Final percent germination (FPG) was higher in darkness than in light at alternating temperature regimes, except under the 20 : 30 °C (night:day) temperature regime. Achenes subjected to a range of constant temperatures in the dark had high FPG over 76. 8 % except at 30 °C (8 %). Photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD) of 100 and 400 µmol·m 2 ·s 1 significantly lowered FPG under a 10 : 20 °C (night:day) regime, while at 0 25 µmol·m 2 ·s 1 PPFD, the FPG was over 92 %. Few achenes germinated at 1. 4 MPa. The most suitable temperature for germination of achenes placed under water stress was 20 °C.

However, {{few studies have}} investigated seed bank and above-ground species composition in degraded semi-arid dune systems, particularly {{in relation to their}} potential to contribute to stabilisation and revegetation. We determined whether soil seed bank and above-ground species composition differed along a chronosequence in the inter-dune lowlands of an active dune field in Inner Mongolia, China. Soil cores were collected in early April 2011 and soil seed bank composition determined using a combination of the seedling emergence and seed extraction methods. Established vegetation, including species composition and abundance, was also surveyed. Relative importance values for all above-ground species and similarities in species composition of vegetation and soil seed bank along the chronosequence were analysed. A clear successional trend was shown for established vegetation along the first three stages identified, followed by a final stage reverting to more mobile substrate due to disturbance by dune movement. This trend was not reflected in the seed bank. Plant and seed bank density increased over time, however, species composition of the seed bank reflected earlier stages rather than the corresponding established vegetation. There was a relationship between established vegetation and the soil seed bank at the earliest stage, driven mainly by the persistence of seeds of the pioneer species Agriophyllum squarrosum and Corispermum candelabrum. A relatively close relationship was also found at the final stage, where frequent disturbance occurred as a result of increasing sand burial, caused by constant directional sand dune movement. While a clear relationship between the seed bank and associated vegetation was not found along the whole chronosequence, the seed bank displayed potential for restoration of pioneer <b>psammophytes</b> and annual herb species, suggesting that it would contribute to regeneration, as well as support latter-stage annuals and several rare and endemic species...|$|R

Our objectives were to determine how spatial scales are related to population patterns and how species spatially adapt tosemi-arid conditions in the riparian ecotone, {{as well as to}} provide theoretical foundation for vegetation restoration on sand dunes in the study area. Methods We selected four representative plant communities under different habitat conditions in the riparian ecotone, measured the position, height and crown diameter of each individual in a 20 m × 30 m plot and studied the population structure, spatial distribution and association of these <b>psammophyte</b> populations using point patternanalysis. Important findings The population structure of A. wellbyi on semi-exposed sandy gravel land and semi-fixed sandy land is that of a growing population, while A. younghusbandii and S. moorcroftiana on fixed sandy land both have the structure of a declining population. Artemisia wellbyi and A. younghusbandii both have a clumped distribution at different scales, while the distribution pattern of S. moorcroftiana changed from clumped to random to clumped to random as the scale increased. Spatial distribution is mainly determined by the smaller size classes, while fluctuations or changes of population distribution are mainly determined by the larger size classes. There is a scale effect among the studied populations, and positive spatial association occurs mainly at certain scales. Spatialassociation is often affected by plant size and environmental heterogeneity. The spatial association of A. wellbyi and S. moorcroftiana on semi-exposed sandy gravel land or semi-fixed sandy land changes from independent to positive to independent to positive. The spatial association of A. wellbyi and Oxytropis sericopetala on semi-exposed sandy gravel land changes from positive to independent to positive to independent to negative, and that of A. younghusbandii and S. moorcroftiana changes from positive to independent. The degree of aggregation weakens with increasing plant size. The smaller size class has a clumped distribution, and the larger has a random distribution or random and clumped. The positive spatial association between different size classes of the same species appears to weaken when the difference of plant size becomes greater and even changes into negative spatial association, while the spatial association of various size classes at a smaller scale often is positive or independent...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This MSc. thesis {{deals with}} karyological, genetic and {{phenotypic}} variation of selected taxa from the genus Dianthus L. in the Czech Republic and adjacent countries. The evolutionary {{history of the}} genus has been shaped by several microevolutionary processes, including interspecific hybridization, genome duplication, and edaphic speciation. These processes led to the origin {{of a number of}} phenotypically similar taxa, which are often restricted to a narrow geographic area. One subendemic and three endemic taxa occur in the Czech Republic. These (sub) species were used as model groups to gain insight into microevolutionary processes in small populations and the postglacial development of the genus in Central Europe. The thesis consists of three parts, each addressing different evolutionary phenomenon: Dianthus arenarius subsp. bohemicus is a critically endangered endemic <b>psammophyte</b> currently known from a single population in Central Bohemia. The site is also inhabited by widespread D. carthusianorum.

The hypothesis that such positioning is related to salinity {{and fertility}} was tested by applying a salt gradient (increasing solutions of NaCl) and a nutritional gradient (different proportions of Hoagland solution). Neither species survived in solutions over 200 mM of NaCl. The shoots of P. mucronata showed negative growth (lower dry mass) {{in the first week}} of exposure to saline solutions. The roots of C. rosea showed great sensitivity to salinity, which resulted in greater growth reduction, with increasing plant age, in comparison with P. mucronata. C. rosea grew best in the nutrient-deficient solution, whereas P. mucronata responded best to the nutrient-rich solution, suggesting that C. rosea is better able to populate less fertile sites, such as the CPF, whereas P. mucronata is more suited to sites that are more fertile, such as the PF.

The crude protein (CP) concentrations of the five shrubs had the tendency to decrease with growing stage, the peak values of C. intermedia, C. korshinskii and S. psammophylla appeared at blooming period and those of H. scoparium and H. laeve appeared at vegetative period. The neutral-detergent fiber (NDF), acid-detergent fiber (ADF) and lignin concentrations of C. intermedia, C. korshinskii and S. psammophylla were all decreased before post-fruiting period and then increased significantly; while the variation tendency of those of H. scoparium and H. leave were alike, and the lowest NDF, ADF and lignin concentrations were at vegetative period or post-fruiting period.

However, no studies have addressed how sexual and asexual reproduction modes of A. wudanica perform at the transitional zones between active dune inter-dune lowlands and active dunes. In early spring, quadrats were randomly {{set up in the}} study area to monitor surviving seedling and/or ramet density and frequency coming from sexual/asexual reproduction of A. wudanica. Iron sticks were inserted near each quadrat to determine wind erosion intensity (WE). Additionally, soil samples were collected nearby each quadrat to test for soil moisture (SM), organic matter (OM) and pH. Surviving seedlings of A. wudanica showed an inverse response in comparison with ramets to SM, OM and WE. Soil moisture showed the most positive effect, and WE the negative effect, on surviving, sexual reproduction seedlings. Contrarily, WE had the most positive effect, and SM the negative effect, on asexual reproduction ramets. This suggests that increases in SM and decreases in WE should benefit recruitment of A. wudanica seedlings. On the contrary, ramets coming from asexual reproduction showed a different response to environmental factors in transition zone habitats. While SM was not a key constraint for the survival of seedlings, they showed a better, positive response to wind erosion environments. Overall, various study environmental parameters could be improved to foster A. wudanica invasion and settlement in the plant community through different reproductive modes, thereby promoting vegetation restoration and rehabilitation...|$|E

We collected soil samples from the rhizosphere of A. ordosica and divided them into five depth intervals, each 10 cm, to 50 cm depth. A total of 28 AM fungal species from four genera were isolated. Of these, 16 species belonged to Glomus, 7 to Acaulospora, 4 to Scutellospora and 1 to Diversispora. Glomus mosseae was the dominant species. Acaulospora bireticulata and G. reticulatum were common species (> 25 % frequency of occurence) and G. constrictum was rare species (≤ 25 % frequency of occurence) at the four sampling sites.

The mainland Chilean species of Sophora appear to have been derived from' ancestors phylogenetically near the extant Argentinean species S. linearifolia and S. rhynchocarpa and the <b>psammophyte</b> S. tomentosa, growing at tropical coastal sites around the world. The Boreotropic hypothesis of Lavin and Luckow is incorporated in our model as the most parsimonious explanation of the evolution of the species of Edwardsia. Sophora is a taxonomic group that meets the following criteria: a center of diversity in North America, an early Tertiary record in North America, and a pantropical distribution. Styphnolobium and Sophora (including Calia) are representatives of Sophora s. l. in the United States, suggesting a migration of the latter from the Northern Hemisphere to South America. Consistent with the Boreotropic hypothesis, a primary diversification center in South America and subsequent migration to the Indian Ocean and New Zealand, the Juan Fernandez Archipelago, Easter Island, and possibly the Hawaiian Islands is the simplest explanation for the evolution of the Edwardsia species.

40|$|THE DYNAMICS OF THE SOUTHERN MOZAMBIQUE COASTAL SYSTEMS OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS. Erosion is the {{dominant}} process of Mozambique’s coastal dynamics. In more than 90 % of the coastline, it is a natural process that occurs {{as a consequence of}} tropical cyclones and of the recent relative sea level rise. The consequences of these processes are the retreat of the coastline and the occurrence of transgressive phenomena in all the sandy systems (beach-dune-lagoon). These are due to the erosion of the upper- and meso-tidal forms, such as beaches, dunes, spits, barrier islands and cliff fronts. At the same time, an infilling of the low coastal forms occurs that is due to the submergence of the sub- and meso-tidal forms, such as beachrock platforms (bio-erosion pools and solution benches filled with sand), estuarine bars and mudflats. Wherever the beachrock platforms are wide enough, despite being partially submerged, they preserve the erosion of the connected beachdune system. The salinization of the freshwater coastal aquifers, both in islands and in the mainland, and the growth of the coral reefs are two other consequences of this gradual submergence. The retreat values recorded in the beaches that experienced these natural dynamics in the southern coast of Mozambique range from 0. 11 to 1. 10 m/year over the last 31 years (1973 - 2004). However, the maximum erosion values of 0. 95 and 1. 75 m/y took place in the southern border beach-dune system (Ponta do Ouro), and were due to disorderly exploitation by the tourist industry. The inland migration of the spit-dune system over the mangrove platforms has changed the sedimentation pattern, and the sand now overlaps the silt mudflats. For this reason, the mangrove flora has undergone ecological changes, such as the substitution of helophyte (Rhyzophora and Ceriops ssp.) by <b>psammophyte</b> species (Aviccenia marina) ...|$|E

40|$|In fragile-ecosystem arid and {{semi-arid}} land, climatic variations, {{water scarcity}} and human pressure accelerate ongoing degradation of natural resources. In order to implement sustainable management, the ecological {{state of the}} land must be known and diachronic studies to monitor and assess desertification processes are indispensable in this respect. The present study is developed {{in the frame of}} WADIS-MAR (www. wadismar. eu). This is one of the five Demonstration Projects implemented within the Regional Programme “Sustainable Water Integrated Management (SWIM) ” (www. swim-sm. eu), funded by the European Commission and which aims to contribute to the effective implementation and extensive dissemination of sustainable water management policies and practices in the Southern Mediterranean Region. The WADIS-MAR Project concerns the realization of an integrated water harvesting and artificial aquifer recharge techniques in two watersheds in Maghreb Region: Oued Biskra in Algeria and wadi Oum Zessar in Tunisia. The WADIS MAR Project is coordinated by the Desertification Research Center of the University of Sassari in partnership with the University of Barcelona (Spain), Institut des Régions Arides (Tunisia) and Agence Nationale des Ressources Hydrauliques (Algeria) and the international organization Observatorie du Sahara et du Sahel. The project is coordinated by Prof. Giorgio Ghiglieri. The project aims at the promotion of an integrated, sustainable water harvesting and agriculture management in two watersheds in Tunisia and Algeria. As agriculture and animal husbandry are the two main economic activities in these areas, demand and pressure on natural resources increase in order to cope with increasing population’s needs. In arid and semiarid study areas of Algeria and Tunisia, sustainable development of agriculture and resources management require the understanding of these dynamics as it withstands monitoring of desertification processes. Vegetation is the first indicator of decay in the ecosystem functions as it is sensitive to any disturbance, as well as soil characteristics and dynamics as it is edaphically related to the former. Satellite remote sensing of land affected by sand encroachment and salinity is a useful tool for decision support through detection and evaluation of desertification indicating features. Land cover, land use, soil salinization and sand encroachment are examples of such indicators that if integrated in a diachronic assessment, can provide quantitative and qualitative information on the ecological state of the land, particularly degradation tendencies. In recent literature, detecting and mapping features in saline and sandy environments with remotely sensed imagery has been reported successful through the use of both multispectral and hyperspectral imagery, yet the limitations to both image types maintain “no agreed-on best approach to this technology for monitoring and mapping soil salinity and sand encroachment”. Problems regarding the image classification of features in these particular areas have been reported by several researchers, either with statistical or neural/connectionist algorithms for both fuzzy and hard classifications methods. In this research, salt and sand features were assessed through both visual interpretation and automated classification approaches, employing historical and present Landsat imagery (from 1984 to 2015). The decision tree analysis was chosen because of its high flexibility of input data range and type, the easiness of class extraction through non-parametric, multi-stage classification. It makes no a priori assumption on class distribution, unlike traditional statistical classifiers. The visual interpretation mapping of land cover and land use was undergone according to acknowledged standard nomenclature and methodology, such as CORINE land cover or AFRICOVER 2000, Global Land Cove 2000 etc. The automated one implies a decision tree (DT) classifier and an unsupervised classification applied to the principal components (PC) extracted from Knepper ratios composite in order to assess their validity for the change detection analysis. In the Tunisian study area, it was possible to conduct a thorough ground truth survey resulting in a record of 400 ground truth points containing several information layers (ground survey sheet information on various land components, photographs, reports in various file formats) stored within the a shareable standalone geodatabase. Spectral data were also acquired in situ using the handheld ASD FieldSpec 3 Jr. Full Range (350 – 2500 nm) spectroradiometer and samples were taken for X-ray diffraction analysis. The sampling sites were chosen {{on the basis of a}} geomorphological analysis, ancillary data and the previously interpreted land cover/land use map, specifically generated for this study employing Landsat 7 and 8 imagery. The spectral campaign has enabled the acquisition of spectral reflectance measurements of 34 points, of which 14 points for saline surfaces (9 samples); 10 points for sand encroachment areas (10 samples); 3 points for typical vegetation (halophyte and <b>psammophyte)</b> and 7 points for mixed surfaces. Five of the eleven indices employed in the Decision Tree construction were constructed throughout the current study, among which we propose also a salinity index (SMI) for the extraction of highly saline areas. Their application have resulted in an accuracy of more than 80...|$|E
