2500|$|Many <b>people</b> <b>wonder</b> {{where the}} Xs came from, and {{how were they}} ever used on beer. [...] In truth, the three Xs are {{actually}} a quality rating system. [...] The system was initially used in Europe during the 16th Century.

2500|$|Nina {{was very}} much {{involved}} in {{the whole process of}} producing the album that she had to give up several television appearances, which included dropping out of her ASAP group and segment entitled the Sessionistas. She explained [...] "Umalis po ako sa ASAP dahil nagprepare po talaga ako sa album. At nasasabay sa mga out of town and out of the country na shows. [...] " [...] She kept a close watch from the album's conceptualization to its songs and arrangement, and even the paper dolls inside the album was her own idea. To be able to do all these things, she had to temporarily disappear in the scene for a while. Production for the album took nearly two years to finish, making <b>people</b> <b>wonder</b> if she had gone out of the music industry for good. In choosing a title for the album, Nina personally decided to call it Stay Alivecoming from the album's second track, [...] "Staying Alive"to remind the people that she is still very much around, in spite of the hiatus on TV, and the long break from the recording scene. She further explained the origin of the title: ...|$|E

6000|$|There are, I say, {{some people}} who are allowed to claim to have no politics,--the office holders, and the clergy and the school {{teachers}} and the hotel keepers.

6000|$|... "But {{everybody}} knows they don't believe in {{getting up and}} testifying, so nobody wonders when they don't.

6000|$|<b>People</b> <b>wonder</b> why I go so much. Well, I go {{partly for}} my health, partly to {{familiarize}} {{myself with the}} road.

60|$|Now {{and then}} the <b>people</b> <b>wondered</b> why nothing was heard of the raider, or of the stolen knife or the other plunder, but nobody was able to throw any light on that matter. Nearly a week had drifted by, and still the thing {{remained}} a vexed mystery.|$|R
50|$|The AAA-0 slogan {{also showed}} up in a strange stamp {{cancellation}} that had some <b>people</b> <b>wondering</b> what on earth it meant. Apparently, Paddy's 39th Infantry had so impressed the German Army that they used the unit's slogan/logo on a pseudo-cancellation on a propaganda postage stamp. An article by Jerry Jensen, , explains the story.|$|R

Then they argue like this: since the Indian [...] believes easily, place Christianity before them and they must [...] believe; confirm its truths by the biblical miracles, and they will [...] no longer doubt. The natural deduction is, that as Christianity [...] makes but indifferent progress in India, the fault is with us: we [...] are not fortunate in presenting the doctrines and the miracles.|$|E

Simplicity is all very well for schoolgirls and women who can't afford {{anything}} better, but you can, and you really ought. Your things are pretty enough in their way, and I rather like {{you to have a}} style of your own, but it looks odd and people will think you are mean if you don't make more show. Besides, you don't do justice to your beauty, which would be both peculiar and striking if you'd devote your mind to getting up ravishing costumes." ...|$|E

He was rather short, rather stout, rather red-haired, but, in fine, for a Prince, not so bad.|$|R
25|$|Firstly, {{steel making}} was a defense industry, so {{they wanted to}} be sure {{national}} security was not endangered.

When she finally got permission, technical problems began.|$|R
6000|$|There {{are many}} Christies, willing to work, yet unable {{to bear the}} contact with coarser natures which makes labor seem degrading, or to endure the hard {{struggle}} for the bare necessities of life when life has lost all that makes it beautiful. <b>People</b> <b>wonder</b> when such as she say they can find little to do; but to those who know nothing of the pangs of pride, the sacrifices of feeling, the martyrdoms of youth, love, hope, and ambition that go on under the faded cloaks of these poor gentle-women, who tell them to go into factories, or scrub in kitchens, for there is work enough for all, the most convincing answer would be, [...] "Try it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{accidents}} that befell that fatal watch {{would fill}} a chapter, and the narrow escapes it had {{would make a}} thrilling tale.

[...] It was always falling off, catching in buttons, or bobbing wildly about when I danced, and more than once I was cut to the soul by hearing benighted <b>people</b> <b>wonder</b> at Miss Pen's bad taste in wearing Salom jewelry. Salom, be it known to the ignorant, is an excellent man who deals in mock ornaments of great brilliancy and cheapness.|$|E

5000|$|Donald C. Bacon {{described}} Longworth as [...] "Debonair and aristocratic, {{given to}} wearing spats {{and carrying a}} gold-headed cane.
