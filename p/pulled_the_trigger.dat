5|$|On August 31, 2003, Sami Atias, an Israeli {{drug dealer}} who {{had belonged to}} an ecstasy ring headed by Abergil and Moshe Malul, was shot at close range and killed {{in the parking lot}} of an Encino café as he was getting into his car. Allegedly he had tried to steal 76 {{kilograms}} of Ecstasy in 2002. According to the indictment, Moshe Malul and fugitive Vineland Boyz′ member Luis Sandoval, were at the scene when Atias was shot, but another man had <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> Itzhak Abergil had offered to help with the slaying during a meeting in Spain, but he did not play a direct role in the killing.|$|E
5|$|Sivanandam interrogates Usha, {{who tells}} him {{how she and}} Rajan fell in love. Sivanandam tricks Usha into using a leaky {{fountain}} pen in order to collect her fingerprints. That evening, he and Naidu meet all of the suspects at Rajan's house. Sivanandam carries out an exercise in which the suspectsincluding Ushamust pretend he is Rajan and shoot him using revolvers loaded with fake bullets. All the suspects shoot him except Usha, who bursts into tears. Sivanandam then demands to have Pattabi and Hema arrested, until Usha reveals the truth: Rajan was a radio engineer who wanted to sell radios to the poor at an affordable price. Unable to get any support from the government, he went to Japan where his work was appreciated. He became a spy selling India's military secrets to Japan. Usha learnt about this and tried unsuccessfully to reform him. She could not stop him and attempted to shoot him. She changed her mind but <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> accidentally, killing him. After revealing the truth, Usha commits suicide.|$|E
25|$|When {{faced with}} his contradictions, Vlad also {{confessed to the}} murder.

25|$|Seconds {{after the}} initial {{exchange}} of gunfire, Smith’s men began running toward their wounded leader, weapons drawn. Murphy rushed over to Smith and wrestled the Winchester from his hands and turned the rifle towards Smith. This is another moment {{believed to have been}} the time that Smith hollered out, “My God, don’t shoot,” but Murphy <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> killing him instantly with a bullet to the heart.|$|E

25|$|According to hitman-turned-informant Charles Crimaldi, {{one time}} DeStefano made his wife Anita take {{his gun and}} put {{the end of the}} barrel in her mouth, then demanded that she pull the trigger. When she <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> and the gun didn't go off, DeStefano began to laugh and told her that he had removed the bullets. He would tell this story over and over again to his mob {{associates}} for amusement.|$|E
25|$|Reid {{grabbed the}} rifle barrel {{with his left}} hand and pressed it down, and with his right he drew his {{revolver}} (if not already drawn) and pointed it at Smith. At that moment, Smith is said to have shouted, “My God, don’t shoot!” Reid <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> but the hammer fell on a faulty cartridge. Reid tried to shoot again as Smith jerked his rifle from Reid’s desperate grasp and quickly moved it in the direction of Reid.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, {{deprived}} of morphine for some days, he borrowed a shotgun on {{the pretext of}} killing a snake and {{shot himself in the}} chest. The wound was not fatal, and Marais therefore put the gun barrel in his mouth and <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> He did so on the farm Pelindaba, belonging to his friend Gustav Preller. For those who are familiar with the dark moods of certain of Marais' poems, there is a black irony here; in Zulu, Pelindaba means 'the end of the business' – although the more common interpretation is 'Place of great gatherings'.|$|E

25|$|Just {{before the}} {{training}} camp commenced, the Drillers <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> on another deal that {{came as a}} shock to many. The deal saw Domenic Mobilio shipped to Philadelphia for Rick Titus, a player that only months earlier had walked out on the Drillers, and whom management had stated would never again be welcomed back. While on the surface, dealing a fan favourite and leading scorer for a guy that was considered persona non grata doesn't quite add up, the underlying issue was that Mobilio had a falling out with management which led to the deal being brokered. This would also mark the third time Titus had been acquired by Edmonton.|$|E
25|$|Footage of Atkins and Jones in {{the vehicle}} with Nesbitt were {{captured}} on the ATM's CCTV camera, which was {{of the two men}} with Nesbitt in the middle and leaning across Jones to withdraw money, and further forensic evidence implicating the two were found in Nesbitt's abandoned vehicle. The two suspects were quickly tracked down and arrested. In custody, each man claimed that the other had <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> Atkins's version of the events, however, was found to contain a number of inconsistencies. Doubts concerning Atkins's testimony were strengthened when a cell-mate claimed that Atkins had confessed to him that he had shot Nesbitt. A deal of life imprisonment was negotiated with Jones in return for his full testimony against Atkins. The jury decided that Jones's version of events was the more coherent and credible, and convicted Atkins of capital murder.|$|E
25|$|By all accounts, Smith was a well-respected and even-tempered man. However Bogan's taunts {{began to}} wear on Smith, who {{eventually}} climbed down from his wagon and headed toward Bogan. As Smith walked toward Bogan, the latter stuck his hand into his coat. Smith told {{him that if he}} pulled his gun, he'd knock him to the ground. Bogan did pull his pistol, at which point Smith did knock him down with one punch. The two then wrestled briefly before Smith was able to take the young man's gun from him. As he did this, Kemp ran over producing his own handgun, and hit Smith {{in the back of the}} head. Smith then turned and pointed his pistol at Kemp, and <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> However, the pistol misfired, according to witnesses, and Kemp fled at top speed. Smith turned Bogan's pistol over to the town marshal.|$|E

25|$|A tragedy {{occurred}} {{early in}} Carlos Salinas's life. On 18 December 1951, {{when he was}} three years old, he, his older brother Raúl, then five, and an eight-year-old friend were playing and the Salinas family's twelve-year-old maid, Manuela, was shot. It was never determined which of the three boys <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> and the incident was declared an accident; it was given newspaper coverage in Excélsior at the time. A judge blamed the Salinas parents for leaving a loaded weapon accessible to their small children. The Salinas family {{did not know the}} last name of their 12-year-old maid Manuela—only that she came from San Pedro Atzcapotzaltongo—and it is unknown whether her family ever claimed her body. They were also exonerated with the assistance of Gilberto Bolaños Cacho, maternal uncle of legendary Mexican comedian Chespirito. He has not commented publicly on this tragic early childhood incident.|$|E
25|$|As senior executioner, Blokhin had the {{official}} title of commandant {{of the internal}} prison at the Lubyanka, which allowed him {{to carry out his}} duties with a minimum of scrutiny and no official paperwork. Although most of the estimated 828,000 NKVD executions conducted in Stalin's lifetime were performed by local Chekists in concert with NKVD troikas, mass executions were overseen by specialist executioners from the Kommandantura. In addition to overseeing the mass executions, Blokhin personally <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> in all of the individual high-profile executions conducted in the Soviet Union during his tenure, including those of the Old Bolsheviks convicted at the Moscow Show Trials; Marshal of the Soviet Union Mikhail Tukhachevsky (convicted at a secret trial); and two of the three fallen NKVD Chiefs (Genrikh Yagoda in 1938 and Nikolai Yezhov in 1940) he had once served under. He was awarded the Badge of Honor for his service in 1937.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} led by Emmanuel Bodjolle and Étienne Eyadéma met {{and agreed}} to remove Olympio from office. The coup {{began in the early}} morning hours of 13 January 1963 with shooting heard throughout the capital city of Lomé as the military attempted to arrest Olympio and his cabinet. Just before dawn, shots were heard outside of the United States Embassy which was close to the residence of Olympio. With the light of dawn, the dead body of Olympio was found three feet from the gate at the front of the embassy by the U.S. Ambassador Leon B. Poullada. It was claimed that when the soldiers attempted to arrest him in the streets of Lomé, he resisted and was shot in the process. Eyadéma claimed later that he was the one who <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> killing Olympio, but this is not clearly established. His body was taken inside the embassy and later picked up by his family.|$|E

25|$|On {{the weekend}} of March 1–2, 1992, Mayor Daley and wife Maggie {{attended}} a family party in New York, and 16-year-old Patrick was to stay with relatives. Patrick told the relatives he was staying with friends and drove his father's new sports utility vehicle to the Daley second home in Grand Beach, Michigan and threw a party Saturday night. Patrick fetched former Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley's 20-gauge double-barrel shotgun from the Daley home {{and handed it to}} his cousin, R. J. Vanecko, 17. Vanecko aimed the shotgun at teenagers, <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> twice and yelled that he was not afraid to use the weapon. A youth threw a concrete goose lawn ornament through the windshield of Mayor Daley's truck, and Patrick punched him. A youth was seriously injured when struck {{in the head with a}} baseball bat wielded by a juvenile, was hospitalized in critical condition, underwent surgery to remove a blood clot on his brain and spent three days in intensive care.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the assassination of its Secretary General Abu Ali Mustafa, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), led by Ahmed Saadat, assassinated the Israeli Tourism Minister, Rehavam Ze'evi in 2001. Fuad Shubaki was suspected by Israel as being the mastermind behind the Karine A affair of 2002. Saadat, Shubaki, and four other Palestinians, including the man who shot Ze'evi, were held at the Jericho jail {{under the supervision of}} British and American wardens in accordance with a deal worked out between US President, George W. Bush and Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, in April 2002. The agreement allowed the prisoners to be transferred from Yasser Arafat's Mukataa in Ramallah, where they were hiding during Operation Defensive Shield of April 2002. The four cell members who actively participated in Ze'evi's assassination were Hamdi Quran, who <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> Basel al-Amar, Majdi Rimawi and Ahed Gholami. In a quick military trial in Ramallah, headed by Brigadier-General Ribhi Arafat, they were sentenced to hard labor. Quran was sentenced to 18 years, Asmar to 12, Rimawi to eight and Gholami to one year. Saadat was never placed on trial. The prison was situated next to the Palestinian Authority (PA) government building. Israeli rightists opposed the deal, saying it allowed the assassin to escape justice, while Palestinians opposed the jailing of one of a senior militant leader under Israeli pressure.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 2006, Airman 1st Class Carl Jerome Ware Jr. of the 886th Expeditionary Security Force Squadron {{assigned}} to Camp Bucca died of non-combat related injuries. Initial reports {{stated that the}} airmen was killed by an accidental discharge of a gun being cleaned by another airman; however in February 2007, {{it was reported that}} Airman 1st Class Kyle J. Dalton, of the 15th Security Forces Squadron, Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, had been charged on 30 November 2007 with one count of murder and failure to obey a lawful order in relation to the shooting. Dalton also faced a charge of assault for a separate incident that occurred on 30 June 2006 involving Ware and another airman. Dalton, who was deployed in the Middle East at the time the charges were brought, had an Article 32 hearing and was Court-martialed on 23 April 2007 at Langley Air Force Base. As part of a plea bargain deal, Dalton pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and violating a lawful general regulation by drawing or aiming a firearm when deadly force was unnecessary. Dalton was sentenced to 10 years in prison, given a dishonorable discharge, reduced in rank from Senior Airman to Airman Basic and ordered to forfeit all pay and allowances. Dalton admitted to the court that he tracked Ware with his pistol in the barracks and <b>pulled</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> thinking the weapon was unloaded. He also admitted that he had previously aimed a loaded M-4 carbine at another airman.|$|E

5000|$|The HK 4 is a straight-blowback, {{double-action}} to single-action pistol. With a {{round in}} the chamber, a bullet may be fired by either <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> or by cocking the hammer and then <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b> <b>The</b> pistol automatically cocks the hammer after a round is fired. The safety incorporates a decocking mechanism that can safely decock the pistol with a {{round in the}} chamber. The hammer is decocked by putting the safety in the [...] "safe" [...] position and <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> which allows <b>the</b> hammer to fall without striking the firing pin. When using center fire cartridges, there is a red marking {{on the top of}} the extractor that serves as a [...] "chamber loaded" [...] indicator. This feature has continued in current H&K pistols. The pistol incorporates a plastic buffer in the frame. The buffer, which is loosely installed in the frame, can be lost during cleaning or can wear out and needs to be replaced periodically.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Ultra Light <b>Trigger</b> was {{designed}} by Tom Kaye in order to evolve the Automag. It reduced <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> <b>pull</b> from nearly 6 lbf (27 N) to a mere 16 ozf (4.4 N) trigger pull. This allowed mechanical markers to have the light feel of an electronic marker giving players an alternative. This innovation of the ULT also allowed players to <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> {{at a higher rate}} than what they could before. Realistically players can reach speeds of 1-14 balls per second depending on how fast they can <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b>|$|R
