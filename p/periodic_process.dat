50|$|Time {{dilation}} {{of moving}} particles as predicted by special relativity {{can be measured}} in particle lifetime experiments. According to special relativity, the rate of clock C traveling between two synchronized laboratory clocks A and B is slowed with respect to the laboratory clock rates. This effect is called time dilation. Since any <b>periodic</b> <b>process</b> can be considered a clock, also the lifetimes of unstable particles such as muons must be affected, so that moving muons should have a longer lifetime than resting ones. Variations of experiments that actually confirmed this effect took place in the atmosphere or in particle accelerators. Other time dilation experiments belong to the group of Ives-Stilwell experiments measuring the relativistic Doppler effect. See also Tests of special relativity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The paper {{considers}} a network with many apparently-independent <b>periodic</b> <b>processes</b> and discusses one {{method by which}} these processes can inadvertent Iy become synchronized. In particular, we study the synchronization of periodic routing messages, and offer guidelines on how to avoid inadvertent synchronization. Using simulations and analysis, we study the process of synchronization and show that the transition from unsynchronized to synchronized traffic {{is not one of}} gradual degradation but is instead a very abrupt ‘phase transition’: in general, the addition of a single router will convert a completely unsynchronized traffic stream into a completely synchronized one. We show that synchronization can be avoided by the addition of randomization to the tra~c sources and quantify how much randomization is necessary. In addition, we argue that the inadvertent synchronization of <b>periodic</b> <b>processes</b> is likely to become an increasing problem in computer networks...|$|R
40|$|The many rhythms {{observed}} {{at all levels}} of biological organization for the most part rely on a molecular or cellular mechanism. In this article I examine the mechanism of <b>periodic</b> <b>processes</b> that possess a psychological component. Three examples are considered in turn. The first pertains to bipolar disorders characterized by an oscillation between a manic state and a depressive state. The second is that of weight cycling, in which dieting is accompanied by periodic bouts of weight loss and regain. The third example relates to the oscillatory dynamics resulting from the interactions between members of a family system. A modeling approach suggests that beyond the differences in mechanism, all these <b>periodic</b> <b>processes,</b> which contain a psychological component, share common properties with biological rhythms: they all represent a mode of temporal self-organization that occurs beyond a point of instability resulting from regulations within the system considered.

40|$|Abstract Most {{industrial}} robots perform a periodically re-peating choreography. Our {{aim is to}} detect disturbances of such a <b>periodic</b> <b>process</b> by a visual inspection system that can be trained {{with a minimum of}} human effort and interaction. We present a solution that monitors the robot with a time-of-flight 3 D camera. Our system can be trained using a few unperturbed cycles of the <b>periodic</b> <b>process.</b> More specifically, principal components are used to find a low-dimensional ap-proximation of each frame, and a One-Class Support Vector Machine is used for one-class learning. We propose a novel scheme for automatic parameter tuning, which exploits the fact that successive images of the training class should be close in feature space. We present exemplary results for a miniature robot setup. The proposed strategy does not require prior information on the dimensions of the machine or its ma-neuvering range. The entire system is appearance-based and hence does not need access to the robot’s internal coordinates. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} model for the {{analysis}} of non-stationary point processes with almost periodic rate of occurrence. The model deals with the arrivals of events which are unequally spaced and show a pattern of periodicity or almost periodicity, such as the rate of financial transactions or customer/phone calls arrivals. The concept of almost periodicity is described and the purely <b>periodic</b> <b>process</b> is just a special case of the almost <b>periodic</b> <b>process.</b> We consider a non-homogeneous Poisson process and model its rate of occurrence as the sum of sinusoidal functions plus a base line. Given the number of sinusoidal functions which is denoted as K, a set of simple and consistent estimates of frequencies, phases and amplitudes which form the sinusoidal functions are constructed mainly by the Bartlett periodogram. The estimates are shown to be asymptotically normally distributed. Computational issues are discussed and it is shown that the frequency estimates have to be resolved with order o(T - 1) to guarantee the asymptotic unbiasedness and consistency of the estimates of phases and amplitudes, where T is the length of the observation period. The prediction of the next occurrence is also discussed. The proposed model is a finite approximation of the almost <b>periodic</b> <b>process</b> in terms of a finite value of K. In practice, the value of K is usually unknown, and we suggest to use the model selection criteria to determine K. Two criteria AIC and BIC are reviewed and discussed in the frame work of our model. Simulation and real data examples are used to illustrate the theoretical results and the utility of the model...|$|E

40|$|Motivation: <b>Periodic</b> <b>processes</b> play {{fundamental}} {{roles in}} organisms. Prominent examples are the cell cycle and the circadian clock. Microarray array technology has enabled us to screen complete sets of transcripts for possible association with such fundamental <b>periodic</b> <b>processes</b> on a system-wide level. Frequently, quite large numbers of genes have been detected as periodically expressed. However, the small overlap between genes identified in different studies has cast some doubts on {{the reliability of the}} periodic expression detected. Results: In this study, comparative analysis suggests that the lacking agreement between different cell-cycle studies might be due to inadequate background models for the determination of significance. We demonstrate that the choice of background model has considerable impact on the statistical significance of periodic expression. For illustration, we reanalyzed two microarray studies of the yeast cell cycle. Our evaluation strongly indicates that the results of previous analyses might have been overoptimistic and that the use of more suitable background model promises to give more realistic results.
