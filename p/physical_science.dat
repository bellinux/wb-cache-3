5|$|Bell {{was the son}} of Thomas Bell, one of {{the founders}} of the iron and alkali company Losh, Wilson and Bell, and his wife Katherine Lowthian. He was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and educated at Dr Bruce's academy in Percy Street, Newcastle, {{followed}} by studying <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> at Edinburgh University and the Sorbonne University, Paris. He gained experience in manufacturing alkalis at Marseilles before returning to Newcastle in 1836 to work in his father's Walker iron and chemical works.|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{chemistry}} positions {{require a}} bachelor's degree or similar {{in a natural}} or <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> as well as laboratory experience in general, organic, and analytical chemistry.

40|$|Learners {{who take}} <b>Physical</b> <b>Sciences</b> in the Further Education and Training Phase in Eastern Cape {{schools have been}} {{performing}} poorly in the subject in the final examinations in Grade 12. This raised the concern of the researcher to determine issues that underlie this. In attempting to {{determine the cause of}} the poor results, a <b>Physical</b> <b>Sciences</b> subject advisor and six <b>Physical</b> <b>Sciences</b> teachers were interviewed to gather information on this problem. The following issues were considered: the <b>Physical</b> <b>Sciences</b> curriculum, the nature and structure of the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (<b>Physical</b> <b>Sciences),</b> learner performance in <b>Physical</b> <b>Sciences,</b> a review of literature on science teaching, strategies of teaching and learning, the role of science teachers, classroom interaction between teachers and learners and the challenges experienced with science teaching.

5|$|Academic Decathlon was {{originally}} organized {{differently than the}} current competition. The original ten events were aesthetics (music and visual arts), conversation, essay writing, mathematics, practical arts, formal speech, <b>physical</b> <b>science,</b> social science, current events, extracurricular activities, and English literature, grammar, and reading. Over time, those events evolved into: economics, essay, fine arts, interview, language and literature, math, science, social sciences, speech and Super Quiz. It was not until 1998 that fine arts was split into its two constituent tests: art and music. Due to this division, the Super Quiz took the place {{of one of the}} other subjects each year. In 1998, Super Quiz replaced economics; from 1999 until 2012, it replaced either science or social science and alternated replacing the two from 2003 to 2012. Beginning with the 2013 season, the Super Quiz consisted of a relay portion only, encompassing questions from the respective year's Science, Language and Literature, Music, Social Science, Art, and Economics curriculum.|$|E
5|$|Galileo made {{original}} {{contributions to}} the science of motion through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics. More typical of science {{at the time were}} the qualitative studies of William Gilbert, on magnetism and electricity. Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, a lutenist and music theorist, had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear relation in physics: for a stretched string, the pitch varies as the square root of the tension. These observations lay {{within the framework of the}} Pythagorean tradition of music, well-known to instrument makers, which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale. Thus, a limited amount of mathematics had long related music and <b>physical</b> <b>science,</b> and young Galileo could see his own father's observations expand on that tradition.|$|E
