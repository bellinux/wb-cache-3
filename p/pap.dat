5|$|On 16 September 1963, Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo and Sarawak were merged and Malaysia was formed. The {{union was}} rocky from the start. During the 1963 Singapore state {{election}}s, a local branch of United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) {{took part in}} the election despite an earlier UMNO's agreement with the <b>PAP</b> not to participate in the state's politics during Malaysia's formative years. Although UMNO lost all its bids, relations between <b>PAP</b> and UMNO worsened. The <b>PAP,</b> in a tit-for-tat, challenged UMNO candidates in the 1964 federal election as part of the Malaysian Solidarity Convention, winning one seat in Malaysian Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Potentially precancerous {{changes in}} the cervix can be {{detected}} by cervical screening, using methods including a <b>Pap</b> smear (also called a cervical smear), in which epithelial cells are scraped {{from the surface of}} the cervix and examined under a microscope. The colposcope, an instrument used to see a magnified view of the cervix, was invented in 1925. The <b>Pap</b> smear was developed by Georgios Papanikolaou in 1928. A LEEP procedure using a heated loop of platinum to excise a patch of cervical tissue was developed by Aurel Babes in 1927. In some parts of the developed world including the UK, the <b>Pap</b> test has been superseded with liquid-based cytology.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, the <b>PAP</b> {{formed a}} workgroup, headed by Phua, to explore {{initiatives}} {{to improve the}} financial security of disabled and special needs children. Phua also led a committee that drew up a five-year plan to improve services for special needs children. The <b>PAP</b> studied their proposals and later implemented some, such as a National non-profit Special Needs Trust Fund. Laws were also drafted to prohibit abuse of the mentally disabled and to allow parents to appoint someone to look after their special needs children after they die.|$|E
50|$|<b>PAPs</b> {{are highly}} conserved within {{eukaryotic}} species, with >80% amino acid homology in mammalian <b>PAPs,</b> and >70% sequence homology in <b>PAPs</b> of plant origin. However sequence analysis reveals {{that there is}} minimal homology between plant and mammal <b>PAPs</b> (<20%), except for the metal-ligating amino acid residues which are identical. The metallic nucleus of <b>PAPs</b> also varies between plants and mammals. Mammalian <b>PAPs</b> which have been isolated and purified have, to this point, been composed exclusively of iron ions, whereas in plants the metallic nucleus is composed of Fe3+ and either Zn2+ or Mn2+. <b>PAPs</b> have also been isolated in fungi, and DNA sequences encoding for possible <b>PAPs</b> {{have been identified in}} prokaryotic organisms, such as in Cyanobacteria spp. and Mycobacteria spp.|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of plant purple acid phosphatases (<b>PAPs),</b> metallophosphoesterases present in some bacteria, {{plants and animals}} are reviewed. All {{members of this group}} contain a characteristic set of seven amino-acid residues involved in metal ligation. Animal <b>PAPs</b> contain a binuclear metallic center composed of two irons, whereas in plant <b>PAPs</b> one iron ion is joined by zinc or manganese ion. Among plant <b>PAPs</b> two groups can be distinguished: small <b>PAPs,</b> monomeric proteins with molecular mass around 35 kDa, structurally close to mammalian <b>PAPs,</b> and large <b>PAPs,</b> homodimeric proteins with a single polypeptide of about 55 kDa. Large plant <b>PAPs</b> exhibit two types of structural organization. One type comprises enzymes with subunits bound by a disulfide bridge formed by cysteines located in the C-terminal region around position 350. In the second type no cysteines are located in this position and no disulfide bridges are formed between subunits. Differences in structural organisation are reflected in substrate preferences. Recent data reveal in plants the occurrence of metallophosphoesterases structurally different from small or large <b>PAPs</b> but with metal-ligating sequences characteristic for <b>PAPs</b> and expressing pronounced specificity towards phytate or diphosphate nucleosides and inorganic pyrophosphate...|$|R

In the 2006 general election, she was fielded as a <b>PAP</b> candidate in Jalan Besar GRC, which was contested by the Singapore Democratic Alliance. During the election campaign, she promised to make Singapore a more inclusive society by representing the disabled and special needs communities. The <b>PAP</b> team won Jalan Besar GRC with 69.26% of the vote.|$|E

Depending {{on the cell}} type, the polymerase can be {{the same type of}} polyadenylate polymerase (<b>PAP)</b> that is used in the nuclear process, or the cytoplasmic polymerase GLD-2.|$|E
5|$|Derek da Cunha has {{proposed}} that the law of large numbers favours the GRC system. According to the theory, {{the large number of}} voters from GRC wards generally, though not necessarily always, reflects the popular vote. This was evident at the 2006 elections, at which the <b>PAP</b> garnered an average of 67.04% of the votes in a contested GRC, while the average was 61.67% for a SMC ward. The national average for the 2006 elections was 66.6%. Similar trends can be seen from previous elections. In fact, the percentage difference in the <b>PAP</b> votes between SMCs and GRCs grew from 3% in 1991, and remained stable at around 5% in the 1997, 2001 and 2006 elections. This may be attributable to the enlargement of the size of GRCs in 1997 which gave greater effect to the law of large numbers.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{a growing}} {{aquaculture}} industry, demand for high-quality proteins for aquatic feeds is increasing. Non-ruminant processed animal proteins (<b>PAPs)</b> have shown great potential for this purpose. Safe reintroduction of non-ruminant <b>PAPs</b> in aqua feed requires methods that can discriminate ruminant and non-ruminant <b>PAPs</b> at contamination levels at or below 2 %. Because the official European Union method lacks species specificity, the performance of MELISA-TEK™ Ruminant, a commercial immunoassay, combined with the MELISA-TEK High Sensitivity Sample Extraction kit was evaluated. Various non-ruminant <b>PAPs</b> spiked with ruminant <b>PAPs</b> (processed at 133, 137, 141, and 145 °C) were analyzed. Results showed an overall specificity of 99 %, indicating no cross-reaction with non-ruminant <b>PAPs.</b> The sensitivity of the assay strongly depended on both processing temperature and proportion of muscle fibers of the ruminant <b>PAPs.</b> Overall sensitivity of samples with 1 and 2 % ruminant <b>PAPs</b> was 92 and 100 %, respectively. For ruminant <b>PAPs</b> processed at 133 and 137 °C, the sensitivity was 100 % for both 1 and 2 % ruminant spikes. Overall accuracies were 96 and 99 % for 1 and 2 % ruminant spikes, respectively. In conclusion, the MELISA-TEK Ruminant assay showed satisfactory results, {{which makes it a}} suitable candidate method to enable safe reintroduction of non-ruminant <b>PAPs</b> in aqua feed...|$|R
40|$|There exists {{two groups}} of purple acid phosphatases(PAPs). Mammalian <b>PAPs,</b> which are {{monomers}} with molecular weight {{in the range of}} 33 000 - 40 000. Plant <b>PAPs,</b> which are dimers or tetramers containing identical subunits of about 55 000. Recently the gene of low molecular weight <b>PAPs</b> (smPAPs) was found in plant. They are significantly similar to mammalian <b>PAPs</b> 2 ̆ 7 but quite different from plant <b>PAPs</b> 2 ̆ 7. In order to understand the exact function of the protein and its distribution in plant, we cloned the sweet potato smPAP gene in pGEX- 2 T vector and expressed the fusion protein in E. coli. The expressed fusion protein was used to generate polyclonal antibodies. The antibodies demonstrated a good reactivity towards the smPAP expressed in baculovirus and <b>PAPs</b> partially purified from sweet potato juice. Therefore, the antibodies make it possible to purify and characterize the smPAP...|$|R

5|$|In {{people with}} stable OHS, the most {{important}} treatment is weight loss—by diet, through exercise, with medication, or sometimes weight loss surgery (bariatric surgery). This {{has been shown to}} improve the symptoms of OHS and resolution of the high carbon dioxide levels. Weight loss may take a long time and is not always successful. Bariatric surgery is avoided if possible, given the high rate of complications, but may be considered if other treatment modalities are ineffective in improving oxygen levels and symptoms. If the symptoms are significant, nighttime positive airway pressure (<b>PAP)</b> treatment is tried; this involves the use of a machine to assist with breathing. <b>PAP</b> exists in various forms, and the ideal strategy is uncertain. Some medications have been tried to stimulate breathing or correct underlying abnormalities; their benefit is again uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, {{should be aware of}} the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A cervical screening test, such as a <b>Pap</b> smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A <b>Pap</b> smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E
5|$|The NMP {{scheme was}} not {{introduced}} without controversy, which may {{lead one to}} question {{the effectiveness of the}} scheme in strengthening representative democracy. Despite the protests of many <b>PAP</b> MPs, the party whip was enforced to effect the passing of this scheme. Criticism of the scheme mainly revolved around the dilution of the democratic legitimacy of the Parliament since the electorate has no say in choosing the NMP based on his or her merits. Further, there may be doubts as to the NMP's commitment and willingness to serve as an MP, since the NMP bypasses the electoral process. The scheme has also given rise to allegations that it serves as another platform for the <b>PAP</b> to undercut support for the opposition.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} safe re-introduction of non-ruminant processed animal proteins (<b>PAPs)</b> in aqua feed, two immunoassays have been tested in an interlaboratory study for their capability to detect ruminant <b>PAPs</b> processed under European conditions. The sensitivity of the MELISA-TEK assay was improved by applying a specific extraction kit. Six approved blank pork and poultry samples were adulterated to produce 15 samples spiked at 0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 2. 0 % with ruminant material, sterilised at either 133 °C or 137 °C. Fourteen participants investigated the 6 blanks and 15 spiked samples, making 21 samples for the final test. For both assays specificity and sensitivity were at 97 % or higher. Concordance and accordance were higher than 95 % with one exception. The results indicate that both assays provided correct results at 0. 5 % and higher for the detecting ruminant <b>PAPs</b> (sterilised at 133 °C) in non-ruminant <b>PAPs.</b> Given the 2 % upper limit of ruminant <b>PAPs</b> in non-ruminant <b>PAPs</b> for avoiding an increase in BSE incidents, these methods are fit for monitoring non-ruminant <b>PAPs</b> intended for aqua feed. </p...|$|R

5|$|In the 2006 general election, despite only {{achieving}} 66.6% of {{the total}} votes cast, the ruling People's Action Party ("PAP") was returned to power with 82 out of the 84 seats.

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, NMP Paulin Tay Straughan {{has argued that}} NMPs, being non-partisan, do not replace either <b>PAP</b> or {{opposition}} MPs.

In other words, the NMP scheme has never compromised the democratic process of free elections.|$|E
40|$|Dissatisfaction of Project Affected People <b>PAPs</b> {{has been}} a common {{phenomenon}} worldwide and {{in most of the}} land acquisition programs carried out in Tanzania. The implementation of such programs has sometimes been delayed due to <b>PAPs</b> negative attitudes as a result of dissatisfactions. This has negative consequences for communities acquiring authorities as well as program financers themselves. This study was aimed at finding out the causes nature and levels of <b>PAPs</b> dissatisfaction in land acquisition programs executed at Kurasini area in Dar es Salaam Tanzania. The study explored methods used to deal with compensation complaints and evaluated the reactions of <b>PAPs</b> towards the said programs. Through interviews and a review of documents submitted to the ministry responsible for land acquisition regarding their dissatisfactions it was possible to undertake the analyses. It was evident from the study that inadequate compensations non-adherence to the laws unfavorable resettlement practices use of force by governments and acquiring authorities in making <b>PAPs</b> accept compensation and lack of <b>PAPs</b> involvement in the acquisition processes were identified as the most critical sources of discontent. Interviews also revealed that there were some dissatisfied <b>PAPs</b> who did not lodge complaints {{for a number of reasons}} but were equally dissatisfied for the same reasons. The study concludes up by recommending among others that the government and the acquiring authorities should adhere to legal procedures governing compulsory purchase and compensation ensure that negotiations are done with all parties involved in the acquisition programs provide alternative plots besides monetary compensation but after all recommendations a plan for peaceful and agreeable resettlement of the <b>PAPs</b> is an initiative which would reduce or eliminate their resentments...|$|R

5|$|From the {{founding}} of modern Singapore in 1819 until 1826, Singapore was headed by two Residents in succession. Following Singapore's amalgamation into the Straits Settlements in 1826, it was governed by a Governor together with a Legislative Council. An Executive Council of the Straits Settlements was introduced in 1877 to advise the Governor but wielded no executive power. In 1955, a Council of Ministers was created, appointed by the Governor {{on the recommendation of}} the Leader of the House. Constitutional talks between Legislative Assembly representatives and the Colonial Office were held from 1956 to 1958, and Singapore gained full internal self-government in 1959. The Governor was replaced by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, who had power to appoint to the post of Prime Minister the person most likely to command the authority of the Assembly, and other Ministers of the Cabinet on the Prime Minister's advice. In the 1959 general elections, the People's Action Party (<b>PAP)</b> swept to power with 43 out of the 51 seats in the Assembly, and Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of Singapore. The executive branch of the Singapore Government remained unchanged following Singapore's merger with Malaysia in 1963, and subsequent independence in 1965. The <b>PAP</b> has been returned to power in every general election and has thus formed the Cabinet since 1959. The Government is generally perceived to be competent in managing the country's economy and largely free from political corruption. On the other hand, it has been criticized for using unfair election tactics, violating freedom of speech and its excessive use of the death penalty (by hanging) for non-violent crimes.|$|E
