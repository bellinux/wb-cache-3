500|$|On Tuesday, 24 July 1705, The <b>Post</b> <b>Man</b> {{announced}} West of Kent v Chatham, an 11-a-side game to {{be played}} in Kent on Tuesday, 7 August. The primary source gives the venue as [...] "Maulden" [...] which {{must have been a}} typeset error as there is no such place. It was possibly Maidstone or Malling. The title [...] "West of Kent" [...] suggests a team representative of several parishes, so this is arguably the earliest known important match in Kent. There were several matches throughout the 18th century involving teams called [...] "West Kent" [...] and [...] "East Kent". Chatham was a prominent centre of cricket in the 18th century.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{match that}} definitely involved county teams, or teams using {{the names of}} counties, was Kent v Surrey at Dartford Brent on Wednesday, 29 June 1709. This was advertised in the <b>Post</b> <b>Man</b> the previous Saturday and played for a stake of £50. From this time, in the 112th season since the sport's earliest definite reference in 1597, there are references to counties in use as team names although it is generally believed that the earliest [...] "inter-county matches" [...] were really inter-parish matches involving two villages {{on either side of}} a county boundary. Dartford was an important club {{in the first half of}} the 18th century and its team at this time featured William Bedle. The match is the earliest known mention of Dartford Brent as a venue.|$|E

500|$|Periodicals called The Post Boy and The <b>Post</b> <b>Man</b> were in {{circulation}} {{during the early}} 18th century. In 1700, a series of ten-a-side matches to be held on Clapham Common, near Vauxhall, was pre-announced on Saturday, 30 March, by The Post Boy. The first was to take place on Easter Monday, 1 April, and prizes of £10 and £20 were at stake. No match reports could be found so the results and scores remain unknown. The advert says the teams would consist of ten [...] "Gentlemen" [...] per side but the invitation to attend was to [...] "Gentlemen and others". This clearly implies that cricket had achieved both the patronage that underwrote it through the 18th century and the spectators who demonstrated its lasting popular appeal. As the event involved [...] "gentlemen only", it was probably minor in quality but is nevertheless the earliest known organised match in the county of Surrey.|$|E
500|$|On Tuesday, 1 and Tuesday, 8 July 1707, Croydon played London twice, {{the first}} game played in Croydon, {{probably}} at Duppas Hill, and the second at Lamb's Conduit Field in Holborn. Both matches were advertised by The <b>Post</b> <b>Man</b> as [...] "two great matches at cricket (to be) plaid, between London and Croydon; the first at Croydon on Tuesday, 1 July, {{and the other to}} be plaid in Lamb's-Conduit-Fields, near Holborn, on the Tuesday following, being the 3rd (sic) of July". No post-match reports could be found so the results and scores are unknown. The match in Croydon is the earliest known important match in Surrey. As with the previous match, it is not known if the teams at this time represented formally constituted clubs and it is possible that both were ad hoc teams drawn from local residents. Croydon and London both had important teams {{in the first half of}} the 18th century. The match in Holborn was a return to the one on 1 July. There has been some confusion about the date of the second match following a misreading of the original source by H. T. Waghorn, who was the first modern researcher, but Tuesday, 8 July is believed to be correct.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of Inside No. 9 production, the {{anthology}} series was a rare genre for British television programmes. Previous horror anthologies include Tales of the Unexpected, The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents; while these would sometimes use comedic elements, they are more prominent in Inside No. 9. Murder Most Horrid followed a similar format, but was far more comedic than horrific. Other anthology-like series on British television include Seven of One and Comedy Playhouse, though these programmes lacked horror elements, and, unlike Inside No. 9, served as pilots for potential series. However, the British anthology show Black Mirror, which also features elements of comedy and horror, was very popular around {{the time of}} Inside No. 9. For Pemberton, the 1970s and 1980s were [...] "full of" [...] anthology shows; other examples included Play for Today, Beasts and Armchair Thriller. More recently, anthologies have become less popular with television executives, but the writers hope that {{they may be able to}} contribute to a [...] "renaissance" [...] for the genre. According to journalist and broadcaster Mark Lawson, this is because anthologies can fail to motivate viewers to stay with a series, and, further, new sets and casts must be paid for each episode, meaning that a six-part anthology series will generally be more expensive than a six-part series in a more standard format. For Lawson, Inside No. 9 was able to overcome these problems through the [...] "pleasing coherence" [...] offered by the fact each episode was set in a number 9, and [...] "the wit and inventiveness" [...] of the opening episodes, which could sufficiently engage viewers. Pemberton and Shearsmith had originally considered alternative ways to link the stories, such as all the settings having a shared <b>post</b> <b>man,</b> but then decided that such a strong relationship between stories was not needed.|$|E

When the rumours reached the Wei imperial capital Luoyang, an official Guo Mou (郭謀) suggested to the emperor to summon Man Chong to Luoyang {{and see if the}} rumours were true, as opposed to immediately removing Man Chong from office. Cao Rui heeded the suggestion. When Man Chong met the emperor, he appeared to be in good health and remained sober after consuming one dan of alcohol. Cao Rui thus concluded that the rumours were untrue and ordered Man Chong to return to his <b>post.</b> <b>Man</b> Chong, however, wanted to remain in Luoyang so he repeatedly sought permission from Cao Rui but was denied. Cao Rui told him, [...] "In the past, Lian Po ate and drank heavily to show that he was in good health, while Ma Yuan turned his body to look backward while he was on horseback to show that he was still fit for battle.

5000|$|Zone {{blocking}} originates with {{blocking the}} first level (defensive line). There are usually two double teams on every zone blocking play (playside and weakside). From each double team, one of the lineman from each will work onto the next level (linebackers). Depending on {{the flow of the}} linebackers, either the drive man (inside blocker of double team) or the <b>post</b> <b>man</b> (outside man of the double team) will leave the double team in order to reach the linebacker. If the linebacker reads {{over the top of the}} double team (outside) then the <b>post</b> <b>man</b> leaves the double team in order to block the flowing linebacker. If the linebacker comes inside the double team (underneath), the drive/inside double teamer will pick up the backer. This blocking scheme creates cut-back lanes, open pockets of space through which the running back can run. Cut-back lanes are created due to an overcommitment (flow) by the defense and a seal block on the backside by linemen.|$|E
