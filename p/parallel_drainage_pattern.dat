40|$|The {{extraction}} of drainage networks and catchment boundaries from digital elevation models (DEMs) has received considerable attention {{in recent years}} and is recognized as a viable alternative to traditional surveys and the manual evaluation of topographic maps. Digital data on the position and characteristics of river networks and catchments are important for the analysis of water resources. GIS tools allow for the combined analysis of digital elevation data and environmental parameters in order to derive this kind of information. In this paper we present an application that selecting river network deriving digital elevation data. In this application, we use catchments as the unit of river abstraction. Many researchers took catchments as the base of hydrographic model because the catchments deriving from digital elevation data can reflect the characteristics of terrain which is the foundation of the river network. In the abstraction of river network, how to keep the structure of the river network after abstraction is the very important issue. This is why we choose the catchments deriving from digital elevation models as the unit of our generalization research. Considering the complication of the structure of river network, in this paper, we only choose three <b>drainage</b> <b>patterns</b> which are dendritic <b>drainage</b> <b>patterns,</b> featherlike <b>drainage</b> <b>patterns,</b> and <b>parallel</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>patterns</b> as the examples of the research.

5000|$|The {{origin of}} today's {{mountain}} topography is debated by geologists. Geologically, the Scandinavian Mountains are an elevated, passive continental margin {{similar to the}} mountains and plateaux found {{on the opposite side}} of the North Atlantic in Eastern Greenland or in Australia's Great Dividing Range. The Scandinavian Mountains attained its height by tectonic processes different from orogeny, chiefly in the Cenozoic. A two-stage model of uplift has been proposed for the Scandinavian Mountains in southern Norway. A first stage in the Mesozoic and a second stage starting from the Oligocene. The uplift of southern Norway has elevated the westernmost extension of the sub-Cambrian peneplain which forms part of what is known as the Paleic surface in Norway. In southern Norway the Scandinavian Mountains had their main uplift phase later (Neogene) than in northern Scandinavia which had its main phase of uplift in the Paleogene. The various episodes of uplift of the Scandinavian Mountains were similar in orientation and tilted landsurfaces to the east while allowing rivers to incise the landscape. Some of the tilted surfaces constitute the Muddus plains landscape of northern Sweden. The progressive tilt contributed also to create the <b>parallel</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>pattern</b> of northern Sweden. Uplift is thought to have been accommodated by coast-parallel normal faults and not by fault-less doming. [...] Therefore the common labelling of the southern Scandivavian Mountains and the northern Scandinavian Mountains as two domes is misleading.|$|E

Geological structure in the form of shear, Pacul normal faults, Grojogan normal faults, and trust fault Kedung winong as well. Mapping regional geologic history begins with precipitated of carbonaceous sandstone unit in transition area to inner shelf and the age is in N 10 -N 12. Then there was a transgression wich limestone units deposited in the age of N 13 -N 16 and sediment deposition in the environment of transition until the middle shelf. Tectonic style of working in this area led to the formation and Fault of Kedungwinong and fault of Pacul as well. On top of limestone units deposited the coral limestone in N 17 -N 18 of sediment deposition in inner shelf environments. After the deposition of these rock units occur again tectonic activity due to Grojogan Fault. Then proceed with the events that led to the appointment of the exposed rock units. Afterward, in this region did not experience rock deposition but exogenic proccesses deposited alluvium unit above the coral in unconformities ways. Exogenic activity continue occurs until present days. Georesources of this area are limestone, springs and clay material for bricks. Geological disasters is ground movement.

30|$|Calculation of {{bifurcation}} {{ratio is}} one of the fundamental methods to understand the structural control over a drainage basin. Results from previous researches carried out in different locations indicate that the mean bifurcation ratio without geological control varies between 3 and 5 (Vittala et al. 2004; Chopra et al. 2005; Kant et al. 2015; Radwan et al. 2017). Vaitarna basin (Rbm- 4.79) shows higher bifurcation ratio as compared to the Ulhas basin (Rbm- 3.94). Hence, Vaitarna river basin is characterised by higher structural control. Observation on the drainage network shows that dendritic <b>drainage</b> <b>pattern</b> is more common in case of lower bifurcation ratio. As the bifurcation ratio increases, the control of structure become higher and river network shows <b>parallel</b> or rectangular <b>drainage</b> <b>pattern.</b> Streams in Vaitarna upstream appears as distinctive <b>parallel</b> <b>drainage</b> network which indicates structural control over the source region but dendritic <b>drainage</b> <b>pattern</b> characterises the Ulhas basin, from source to mouth reflects relatively less control of structure on drainage network.|$|R

30|$|The morphometric {{analysis}} {{coupled with}} remote sensing and {{geographical information system}} techniques evaluates various valuable parameters for the watershed development plan of drought-prone Andhale watershed of Pune district, Maharashtra. The {{upper part of the}} watershed shows parallel–sub <b>parallel</b> and rectilinear <b>drainage</b> <b>patterns</b> indicative of structural control, whereas the lower part shows dendritic <b>drainage</b> <b>pattern</b> revealing the homogeneity in texture and lack of structural control. The elongated shape of this basin is indicated by values of form factor, circulatory ratio and elongation ratio. The mean bifurcation ratio is observed to be 4.65 indicating the watershed is less affected by structural disturbances, and <b>drainage</b> <b>pattern</b> is not much influenced by geological structures. The hypsometric integral obtained for Andhale watershed is 0.316 indicating maturity stage of the basin. The longitudinal profile depicts steep gradient at the origin but it gradually flattens out as the river erodes its base level. The high values of drainage density, stream frequency, infiltration number and drainage texture indicate that the study area is underlain by impermeable rocks responsible for high runoff. Thus, the results of this analysis would be useful in determining the effect of catchment characteristics such as size, shape, slope of the catchment on runoff vis-a-vis the scope for water harvesting.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the geomorphological and seismic features of this plain and its immediate vicinity. To that end, geologic and topographic maps of the area were examined, and information on the processes of geomorphological configuration was obtained. In the meantime, an outline geomorphological map was generated. In addition, earthquakes and their effects on the area were gathered. Field studies were conducted in different time periods; information collected in the field. Data obtained from different sources were integrated, and the results were found. Miocene and Pliocene era volcanic formations have an important effect in the formation of Bigadiç basin. Alluvium belonging to the Quaternary era is the youngest geologic formation in the area. Rivers with parallel and sub <b>parallel</b> dendritic <b>drainage</b> <b>patterns</b> take their sources from high areas in the west and the east of Bigadiç plain, and flow towards Simav stream. These rivers lie along the east-west direction. Faultlines are located along the SE-NW direction, and the study area is seismotectonically situated between the North Anatolian Fault Zone and the Aegean Graben System. Some faults in the area intersect the Pliocene formations. The presence of epigenetic gorges and terraces at different elevations indicates that the area is topographically young and has a polycyclic structure. Bigadiç plain and its immediate vicinity have the characteristics of a tectonic basin and have substantially undergone faulting. This is an outgrowth of the fact that these areas are under the threat of devastating earthquakes. Bigadiç plain and its vicinity have suffered 27 large scale earthquakes in last two millenniums...|$|R

30|$|The {{quantitative}} {{analysis of the}} watershed {{is important for the}} quantification of the channel network and to understand its geo-hydrological behaviour. Assessment of drainage network and their relative parameters have been quantitatively carried out for the Chakrar watershed of Madhya Pradesh, India, to understand the prevailing geological variation, topographic information and structural setup of the watershed and their interrelationship. Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) has been used for the delineation and calculation of the morphometric parameters of the watershed. The Chakrar watershed is sprawled over an area of 415  km 2 with dendritic, <b>parallel</b> and trellis <b>drainage</b> <b>pattern.</b> It is sub-divided into nine sub-watersheds. The study area is designated as sixth-order basin and lower and middle order streams mostly dominate the basin with the drainage density value of 2.46  km/km 2 which exhibits gentle to steep slope terrain, medium dense vegetation, and less permeable with medium precipitation. The mean bifurcation value of the basin is 4.16 and value of nine sub-watersheds varies from 2.83 to 4.44 which reveals drainage networks formed on homogeneous rocks when the influences of geologic structures on the stream network is negligible. Form factor, circularity ratio and elongation ratio indicate an elongated basin shape having less prone to flood, lower erosion and sediment transport capacities. The results from the morphometric assessment of the watershed are important in water resources evaluation and its management and for the selection of recharge structure in the area for future water management.|$|R
