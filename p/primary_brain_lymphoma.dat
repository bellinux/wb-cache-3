5000|$|A primary {{central nervous}} system {{lymphoma}} (PCNSL), also known as microglioma and <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> is a primary intracranial tumor appearing mostly in patients with severe immunodeficiency (typically patients with AIDS). PCNSLs represent around 20% of all cases of lymphomas in HIV infections (other types are Burkitt's lymphomas and immunoblastic lymphomas). Primary CNS lymphoma is highly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (> 90%) in immunodeficient patients (such as those with AIDS and those immunosuppressed), and {{does not have a}} predilection for any particular age group. Mean CD4+ count at time of diagnosis is ~50/uL. In immunocompromised patients, prognosis is usually poor. In immunocompetent patients (that is, patients who do not have AIDS or some other immunodeficiency), there is rarely an association with EBV infection or other DNA viruses. In the immunocompetent population, PCNSLs typically appear in older patients in their 50's and 60's. Importantly, the incidence of PCNSL in the immunocompetent population has been reported to have increased more than 10-fold from 2.5 cases to 30 cases per 10 million population. [...] The cause for the increase in incidence of this disease in the immunocompetent population is unknown.|$|E

40|$|A {{panel of}} seven {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{has been used}} to characterise 164 cerebral and spinal tumours. These reagents have enabled rapid and accurate diagnosis of tumours to be made, particularly in cases where standard techniques have proved equivocal. On the basis of characteristic antigenic profiles of tumours, it has been possible to distinguish between gliomas, meningiomas, schwannomas, medulloblastomas, neuroblastomas, choroid plexus tumours, various metastatic deposits, and <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> The reagents used in the study comprise antibodies binding to (a) most neuroectodermally derived tissues and tumours (UJ 13 A), (b) fetal brain and tumours of neuroblastic origin (UJ 181. 4), (c) schwannomas, normal and neoplastic neurones (UJ 127. 11), (d) glial cells (FD 19), (e) epithelial cells (LE 61), and (f) leucocytes (2 D 1). Some reagents, such as antibody A 2 B 5, were less effective as diagnostic markers than originally suggested by previously described specificity. This monoclonal antibody reacted with both neuroectodermal and epithelial derived tumours. The panel of monoclonal antibodies was most useful in the diagnosis of tumours composed of small round cells, particularly lymphoma and neuroblastoma, but the pattern of reactivities allowed most of the central nervous system tumours to be accurately classified.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{long-term}} effect of HAART on non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) incidence {{in people with}} HIV (PHIV). DESIGN: Follow-up of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). METHODS: Between 1984 and 2006, 12 959 PHIV contributed a total of 75 222 person-years (py), of which 36 787 were spent under HAART. Among these PHIV, 429 NHL cases were identified from the SHCS dataset and/or by record linkage with Swiss Cantonal Cancer Registries. Age- and gender-standardized incidence was calculated and Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR). RESULTS: NHL incidence reached 13. 6 per 1000 py in 1993 - 1995 and declined to 1. 8 in 2002 - 2006. HAART use {{was associated with a}} decline in NHL incidence [HR = 0. 26; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 20 - 0. 33], and this decline was greater for <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lymphomas</b> than other NHL. Among non-HAART users, being a man having sex with men, being 35 years of age or older, or, most notably, having low CD 4 cell counts at study enrollment (HR = 12. 26 for or= 350 cells/microl; 95 % CI, 8. 31 - 18. 07) were significant predictors of NHL onset. Among HAART users, only age was significantly associated with NHL risk. The HR for NHL declined steeply in the first months after HAART initiation (HR = 0. 46; 95 % CI, 0. 27 - 0. 77) and was 0. 12 (95 % CI, 0. 05 - 0. 25) 7 to 10 years afterwards.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{examined}} {{survival and}} prognostic factors {{of patients who}} developed HIV-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) {{in the era of}} combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). DESIGN AND SETTING: Multicohort collaboration of 33 European cohorts. METHODS: We included all cART-naive patients enrolled in cohorts participating in the Collaboration of Observational HIV Epidemiological Research Europe (COHERE) who were aged 16 years or older, started cART at some point after 1 January 1998 and developed NHL after 1 January 1998. Patients had to have a CD 4 cell count after 1 January 1998 and one at diagnosis of the NHL. Survival and prognostic factors were estimated using Weibull models, with random effects accounting for heterogeneity between cohorts. RESULTS: Of 67 659 patients who were followed up during 304 940 person-years, 1176 patients were diagnosed with NHL. Eight hundred and forty-seven patients (72 %) from 22 cohorts met inclusion criteria. Survival at 1 year was 66 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 63 - 70 %] for systemic NHL (n = 763) and 54 % (95 % CI: 43 - 65 %) for <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (n = 84). Risk factors for death included low nadir CD 4 cell counts and a history of injection drug use. Patients developing NHL on cART had an increased risk of death compared with patients who were cART naive at diagnosis.

EBV load was measured in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) and plasma samples using a semi-quantitative PCR method. ResultsPBMC-EBV levels in HIV-infected patients were higher than in the blood donors (p 0. 05), while the C-BL group had significantly lower levels (p 0. 05), while significantly lower levels were found in cases with less than 50 cells/mm 3 (p< 0. 05). In all HIV-infected patients, plasma-EBV load was lower than, or similar to, PBMC-EBV load, unlike 2 / 7 HIV-positive <b>brain</b> <b>lymphoma</b> patients. ConclusionsDuring HIV infection PBMC-EBV load rises in comparison to healthy carriers, but decreases when immunosuppression progresses and CD 4 + T cell count becomes < 50 /mm 3.

Multiplicative Poisson regression was used to express trends as average annual percent change (AAPC). Joinpoint regression was used to identify sharp changes in incidence occurring over this period. Overall, incidence increased modestly (AAPC, 1. 1; 95 % CI, 0. 8 â€“ 1. 4). When <b>brain</b> <b>lymphomas</b> were excluded, this increase remained statistically significant.

30|$|Primary {{central nervous}} system lymphomas (PCNSLs) are rare {{diseases}} which account 1 â€“ 2 Â % of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and 3 â€“ 5 Â % of primary brain tumor lesions (GhesquiÃ¨res et al. 2009; Sierra Del Rio et al. 2009). Their diagnosis requires that any other location of systemic NHL is excluded (Oâ€™Neil et al. 1995). PCNSL is usually classified as a diffuse large B cell lymphoma. It occurs frequently as congenitally acquired or in immunocompromised patients. It commonly involves frontal lobes, corpus callum, or deep periventricular structures; may involve eyes, meninges or spinal cord. The treatment remains poorly codified and involves drugs crossing the bloodâ€“brain barrier which can be administered intrathecally or intravenously, associated or not with radiotherapy. Surgery with the increased risks of complications in deep locations is not needed outside of stereotactic biopsy for diagnostic purposes (Abrey et al. 2005).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review {{is to provide a}} {{sufficiently}} detailed perspective on epidemiologic studies of <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> tumors to encourage multidisciplinary etiologic and prognostic studies among surgeons, neuro-oncologists, epidemiologists, and molecular scientists. Molecular tumor markers that predict survival and treatment response are being identified with hope of even greater gains in this area from emerging array technologies. Regarding risk factors, studies of inherited susceptibility and constitutive polymorphisms in genes pertinent to carcinogenesis (for example, DNA repair and detoxification genes and mutagen sensitivity) have revealed provocative findings. Inverse associations of the history of allergies with glioma risk observed in 3 large studies and reports of inverse associations of glioma with common infections suggest a possible role of immune factors in glioma genesis or progression. Studies continue to suggest that brain tumors might result from workplace, dietary, and other personal and residential exposures, but studies of cell phone use and power frequency electromagnetic fields have found little to support a causal connection with brain tumors; caveats remain.

He had first been admitted 2 months previously {{for treatment of}} Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. A magnetic resonance imaging scan on admission showed multiple white matter lesions involving both subcortical cerebral hemispheres and cerebellar regions, with no mass effect or surrounding edema. JC virus was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction in the cerebrospinal fluid. These findings were diagnostic of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). His CD 4 count was 34 cells/mL, and his HIV ribonucleic acid level was 800, 789 copies/mL. He was treated with a combination antiretroviral therapy. He was last reviewed in October 2011. He was fully independent socially and mentally, but he still had some residual neurologic signs with right-sided homonymous hemianopia and visual agnosia. His HIV ribonucleic acid level was undetectable, and his CD 4 count was 574 cells/mm 3. Although the median survival of patients with PML was poor before the antiretroviral therapy era, our patient, who is now aged 55 years, is still alive 12 years after the diagnosis. The diagnosis of PML and differential diagnosis of focal neurologic signs in HIV-positive patients are discussed in this case report.

40|$|The actual role of 18 F-FDG PET/CT in {{evaluating}} <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lymphoma</b> {{is still an}} open issue. Brain lymphoma usually show elevated 18 F-FDG uptake, often higher than other brain tumors or inflammatory processes, but the metabolic behavior of this lymphoma is not still understood. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} particular metabolic behavior of this lymphoma. Forty six patients (21 female, 25 male) with histologically-confirmed brain lymphoma who underwent 18 F-FDG PET/CT from vertex to the mid-thigh for initial staging were retrospectively evaluated. The PET images were analyzed visually and semi-quantitatively by measuring the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), lesion-to-liver SUVmax ratio, lesion-to-blood pool SUVmax ratio and the tumor to normal brain uptake ratio (T/N ratio) and compared with epidemiological (age, sex, HIV infection) and morphological (tumor size, MRI appearance) characteristics. Thirty-eight patients (83 %) had positive 18 F-FDG PET/CT (average SUVmax was 15. 6 [*]Â±[*] 9. 2; lesion-to-liver SUVmax ratio 5. 8 [*]Â±[*] 2. 8; lesion-to-blood pool SUVmax ratio 7. 1 [*]Â±[*] 3. 8, T/N ratio 3. 1 [*]Â±[*] 1. 7) at the corresponding brain lesion; the remaining 8 (17 %) were not 18 F-FDG avid. 18 F-FDG avidity was significantly associated with morphological appearance and tumor size and not correlated with other features. 18 F-FDG PET/CT detected extracranial disease in two cases (4 %) with negative bone marrow biopsies and CT. In conclusion, brain lymphomas are 18 F-FDG avid in 83 % of cases showing high 18 F-FDG uptake and 18 F-FDG avidity is correlated with tumor size and morphological appearance of the lesion. PET/CT helped to recognize extracranial disease in two patients...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} the reasons for ICU admission and to evaluate the outcome and prognostic factors of patients with primary malignant brain tumors (PMBT) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). This is a retrospective observational cohort study of 196 PMBT patients admitted to two ICUs over a 19 -year period. Acute respiratory failure was the main reason for ICU admission (45 %) followed by seizures (25 %) and non-epileptic coma (14 %). Seizures were more common in patients with glial lesions (84 vs. 67 %), whereas patients with <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>lymphoma</b> were more frequently admitted for shock (42 vs. 18 %). Overall ICU and 90 -day mortality rates were 23 and 50 %, respectively. Admission for seizures was independently associated with lower ICU mortality [odds ratio (OR) 0. 06], whereas the need for mechanical ventilation (OR 6. 85), cancer progression (OR 7. 84), respiratory rate (OR 1. 11) and Glasgow coma scale (OR 0. 85) were associated with higher ICU mortality. Among the 95 patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU mortality was 37 % (n = 35). For these patients, admission for seizures was associated with lower ICU mortality (OR 0. 050) whereas cancer progression (OR 7. 49) and respiratory rate (OR 1. 08) were associated with higher ICU mortality. The prognosis of PMBT patients admitted to the ICU appears relatively favorable compared to that of hematologic malignancies or solid tumors, especially when the patient is admitted for seizures. The presence of a PMBT, therefore, does not appear to be sufficient for refusal of ICU admission. Predictive factors of mortality may help clinicians make optimal triage decisions...|$|E

40|$|There are {{conflicting}} reports from Europe and North America regarding {{trends in the}} incidence of <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> tumor, whereas the incidence of <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> tumors in Australia is currently unknown. We aimed to determine the incidence in Australia with age-, sex-, and benign-versus-malignant histology-specific analyses. A multicenter study was performed in the state of New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), which has a combined population of > 7 million with > 97 % rate of population retention for medical care. We retrospectively mined pathology databases servicing neurosurgical centers in NSW and ACT for histologically confirmed <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> tumors diagnosed from January 2000 through December 2008. Data were weighted for patient outflow and data completeness. Incidence rates were age standardized and trends analyzed using joinpoint analysis. A weighted total of 7651 <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> tumors were analyzed. The overall US-standardized incidence of <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> tumors was 11. 3 cases 100 000 person-years (Â± 0. 13; 95 % confidence interval, 9. 8 â€“ 12. 3) during the study period with no significant linear increase. A significant increase in <b>primary</b> malignant <b>brain</b> tumors from 2000 to 2008 was observed; this appears to be largely due to an increase in malignant tumor incidence in the â‰¥ 65 -year age group. This collection represents the most contemporary data on <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> tumor incidence in Australia. Whether the observed increase in malignant <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> tumors, particularly in persons aged â‰¥ 65 years, is due to improved detection, diagnosis, and care delivery or a true change in incidence remains undetermined. We recommend a direct, uniform, and centralized approach to monitoring <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> tumor incidence that can be independent of multiple interstate cancer registries...|$|R
