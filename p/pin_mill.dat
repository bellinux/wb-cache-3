5000|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> {{has often}} {{been the subject of}} {{painting}} and photography, and is a popular yacht and dinghy sailing destination. During WWII many yachts were placed for storage west of the hamlet in what were then called 'the saltings,' awaiting the cessation of hostilities. The moorings in the river were home to the Royal Harwich One Design Class boats for many years in the 1940s. A feature film about sailing, [...] "Ha'penny Breeze," [...] was filmed here in 1950, featuring the Welsh actress Gwyneth Vaughan. There is a boatyard, and the <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> Sailing Club has hosted an annual Barge Match since 1962. The Grindle is a small stream that flows alongside <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> Common down to the <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> Hard on the foreshore. It is used by dinghies to ferry sailors ashore.Sadly due to the influx of houseboats and Dutch barges let out to holiday makers and week enders there is a serious risk health risk to all those using the waters of <b>pin</b> <b>Mill</b> for leisure activities especially to the many children who in hot weather play , paddle and swim in the water which is fouled daily by over 40 vessels (houseboats and holiday lets)all dumping raw sewage and foul water onto the <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> foreshore.

40|$|Stirred Mills are {{becoming}} increasingly used for fine and ultra-fine grinding. This technology is still poorly understood when used in the mineral processing context. This makes process optimisation of such devices problematic. 3 D DEM simulations {{of the flow of}} grinding media in pilot scale tower <b>mills</b> and <b>pin</b> <b>mills</b> are carried out in order to investigate the relative performance of these stirred mills. In {{the first part of this}} paper, media flow patterns and energy absorption rates and distributions were analysed to provide a good understanding of the media flow and the collisional environment in these mills. In this second part we analyse steady state coherent flow structures, liner stress and wear by impact and abrasion. We also examine mixing and transport efficiency. Together these provide a comprehensive understanding of all the key processes operating in these mills and a clear understanding of the relative performance issues. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The pin-flange adapter {{is used to}} avoid leakage at the interface of two waveguides even when a gap between them is present and can be fitted onto any standard WR 03 waveguide flange. Tolerance measurements were performed with gaps ranging from 30 - 100 mu m.

The micromachined pin flange is shown to have better performance than the standard connection and similar performance to the <b>milled</b> <b>pin</b> flange and choke flange. The benefits of micromachining over milling are the possibility to mass produce pin flanges and the better accuracy in the 2 D design. Measurements were performed with and without screws fixing the flanges.

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteFadi M. AramouniJeffrey A. GwirtzIn {{order to}} improve the quality of {{products}} available for consumers who require a gluten-free diet, this study examined the effects of sorghum flour composition and particle size on functionality in gluten-free batter bread. White, food-grade sorghum was milled to flour of varying extraction rates (60 %, 80 %, 100 %), and was subsequently pin-milled at different speeds (no pin-milling, low- speed, and high-speed) to create flours of both variable composition and particle size. Two commercially-milled sorghum flour samples (AF and TV) were included in the study and subjected to the same pin-milling treatments. Characterization of each flour included measurements of flour composition, total starch content, particle size distribution, damaged starch, and water absorption. Bread characterization included measurement of specific volume, crumb properties, and crumb firmness through the use of digital imaging and texture profile analysis. 	Significant differences were found (p< 0. 05) in the composition of sorghum flours of varying extraction rate, most notably for fiber and total starch contents. Flour particle size and starch damage were significantly impacted by extraction rate and speed of <b>pin</b> <b>milling</b> (p< 0. 05). With the exception of the commercial flour samples, water absorption increased significantly with increasing extraction rate and speed of pin-milling speed (p< 0. 05). 	Within all treatments, breads produced from 60 % extraction flour had significantly higher specific volumes, better crumb properties, and lower crumb firmness when compared to all other extractions and flour types. These measured bread characteristics were significantly impacted by flour properties, specifically particle size, starch damage, and fiber content (p< 0. 0001). The commercial flours studied produced breads of low specific volume, poor crumb properties, and dense textures. These results can assist millers and product developers in advancing the quality of sorghum-based gluten-free foods for the consumers that require them. Further research is necessary to better understand the extent to which particle size, and therefore starch damage, can improve sorghum-based gluten-free breads...|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the war the only grenade in service with the army was the No 1 Grenade. Because of the {{problems}} associated with it, the Jam Tin Grenade was designed. It contained an inner can of explosive with an outer can of metal fragments or ball bearings. The fuses that were developed for the Jam Tin Grenade were activated by friction or a by lighted taper which was often replaced by a lighted cigarette. This was followed by the highly successful Mills bomb in 1915. It was oval in shape to fit into a clenched fist and time fused. The detonator was activated by a spring driven firing pin which was restrained by a lever that in turn was locked by a safety <b>pin.</b> The <b>Mills</b> bomb was a defensive grenade. After throwing the user had to take cover immediately and a competent thrower could manage 20 yd with reasonable accuracy. Adopted as the standard grenade, over 33 million Mills bombs were produced in the final three years of the war.|$|R
40|$|MgB 2 superconductors {{have the}} {{outstanding}} {{potential to be}} integrated into diverse commercial applications. However, the critical current density Jcin MgB 2 is still smaller compared with expectations for an optimised material in these applications. Various flux pinning mechanisms are introduced into MgB 2 superconductors to improve Jcby different methods, including irradiation, chemical doping and ball milling. On the other hand, these methods mainly focused on the enhancement of pinning, but always neglect or even worsen the grain connectivity, which limits the further improvement in Jc. Recently, the low-temperature synthesised MgB 2 exhibits improved Jcdue to the increases in both the grain connectivity and flux <b>pinning.</b> Ball <b>milling</b> pre-treatment of original powders, usage of different Mg-based precursors and the additions of different metal or alloys are employed to enhance the sintering efficiency of MgB 2 at low temperature. Among them, the minor metal or alloy additions are {{proved to be the}} most convenient, effective and inexpensive way in accelerating the fabrication of MgB 2 superconductors at low temperature. Combining the advantages of metal-activated sintering and carbon doping, it is also proposed that the low-cost MgB 2 superconductors with further improved Jcwill be rapidly synthesised at low temperature with metal and carbon-based chemical co-doping. 2011 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining and ASM International...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to establish the effects of different milling techniques on the solvent-free electrostatic separation process for navy bean flour as well as to develop a model based on near infrared and fluorescence data to determine protein and starch content of the protein- and starch-enriched fractions using multivariate methods (i. e. partial least squares regression). Data fusion was used to combine the NIR and fluorescence spectra to try to achieve a model that had better predictability for protein and starch content. Protein content was measured using Kjeldahl digestion and starch content was measured using a dinitrosalicylic (DNS) acid array. The samples used in the NIR model are navy bean flour fractions from the electrostatic separation and the raw navy bean flour. There are 102 samples that are split in calibration (82 samples) and validation (20 samples) sets. The protein-enriched samples are collected from the electrostatic plate while the starch-enriched fractions are collected {{from the bottom of the}} electrostatic separator. The acquisition of reproducible infrared and fluorescence data from powder samples was successfully achieved. The <b>pin</b> <b>milled</b> navy bean flour had an average particle size almost three times smaller than the regular milled navy bean flour which could have contributed to the a high protein content (40. 7 %) of the protein-enriched fraction. The regular milled flour had a much higher protein extraction under optimum conditions but could only achieved a lesser protein content (32. 5 %) for the protein-enriched fraction. The regular milled navy bean flour also seemed to have particles disaggregate in the triboelectric charging process. Multivariate methods and pre-treatment techniques were compared for the NIR spectra of the navy bean flour fractions from electrostatic separation to measure the protein and starch content. The best method used Multiplicative Scatter Correction (MSC) pre-treatment with PLS regressions and had R 2 values of prediction of 0. 965 and 0. 912 for protein and starch content, respectively. The N-way partial least squares (NPLS) regression was still a good model seeing as the R 2 values of prediction for starch and protein content were 0. 946 and 0. 885, respectively. Two fluorophores were observed in navy bean flour: tryptophan and an unknown peak. It was observed that the starch model using the fluorescence dataset was highly correlated to the model’s predicted protein content (R 2 of 0. 978). The protein content model was better calibrated using the training set as well as providing a better prediction using the validation set for both NIR and fluorescence spectra. Data fusion was achieved by combining the NIR and unfolded fluorescence spectra of the navy bean flour fractions. The individual techniques had undergone pre-treatment separately and yielded the best model for determining protein content. Starch content was best determined using only the NIR spectra...|$|R
40|$|Homogeneous dispersions of fissile and fertile {{material}} in graphite are being currently considered as fuel for high-temperature, gas-cooled nuclear reactors. A possible method of fuel preparation involves compaction of finely ground artificial graphite with U and Th metal powders. Size reduction of artificial graphite is therefore {{of interest in}} the preparation of graphite-fuel compacts. Reactor graphite has been successively size reduced in a jaw crusher, <b>pin</b> disc <b>mill</b> and ball mill to give material 50 % finer than 9 microns, and with a B. E. T. nitrogen adsorption surface area ranging up to 18. 4 m 2 /g. This variables in ball milling have been studied, and in particular it was found that Ni-hard balls gave a faster grinding rate, but a higher contamination than was obtained with steel balls. Leaching with boiling HCI was effective in removing contamination introduced by these grinding media. The Rosin-Rammler function, R = 100 e - (x/x) n applied to the size distributions of the ground graphite. In the size range 70 - 1000 microns the distribution constant "n" equaled 1, which is consistent with publishing data for other materials. However, above and below this size range, the distribution constant approximated 2. This high value of n for the sub-sieve range has not been previously reported, but is not peculiar to artificial graphite as other materials were found to have a similar value of n...|$|R
40|$|Chickpea grain {{contains}} a high amount of starch and valuable protein. Many grain legumes (pulses) can be processed by <b>pin</b> <b>milling</b> and air classification with high separation efficiency. However, chickpea exhibits low separation efficiency {{because it has}} a relatively high fat content compared to other pulses. Therefore, the main goal of this research was to improve the starch-protein separation from chickpea flour in order to increase the economic value of chickpea grain. The chemical composition of pin-milled chickpea flour was determined. The functional and physical properties of chickpea flour affecting starch-protein separation were determined. No chemical interactive force was detected between starch granules and protein particles. Therefore, a physical separation technique, i. e. applying centrifugal force in a hydrocyclone, was employed to separate starch granules from protein particles. Using a hydrocyclone, centrifugal force was applied to chickpea flour particles. Chickpea flour was suspended in two different media, isopropyl alcohol or deionized water. In both media, high inlet pressure resulted in smaller geometric mean diameter of particles collected in the overflow and underflow. Isopropyl alcohol as a medium resulted in particles with smaller geometric mean diameter than did deionized water. Starch and protein separation efficiencies were higher at greater inlet pressures. The application of a double-pass hydrocyclone process increased the purity of starch in the underflow and of protein in the overflow, although this process reduced separation efficiencies. Starch granules and protein particles were separated at higher purities in deionized water than in isopropyl alcohol. Separation in deionized water resulted in higher starch separation efficiency and lower protein separation efficiency than did separation in isopropyl alcohol. This difference was due to the difference in density and viscosity of the two media. The higher viscosity of isopropyl alcohol reduced the likelihood of starch granules reaching the inner hydrocyclone wall. Thus, some starch granules were retained in the overflow instead of in the underflow. Additionally, the centrifugal force and drag force applied to the chickpea flour particles differed between the two different media. Hydrocyclone operation resulted in higher centrifugal force and lower drag force in deionized water than in isopropyl alcohol. Since the drag force in isopropyl alcohol was higher than that in deionized water, some small starch granules were diverted to the overflow which caused reduction of protein purity. The use of pH 9. 0 and defatting of chickpea flour improved both starch and protein separation efficiencies. Chickpea flour in deionized water at a feed concentration of 5 % yielded a pumpable slurry which was delivered efficiently to the hydrocyclone at an inlet pressure of 827 kPa Fractionation of starch and protein from chickpea flour in deionized water using an integrated separation process resulted in starch and protein fractions containing 75. 0 and 81. 9 % (d. b.) starch and protein, respectively. This process resulted in starch and protein separation efficiencies of 99. 7 and 89. 3 %, respectively. Experiments were also conducted to determine the physical and functional properties of chickpea flour and starch and protein fractions. Thermal conductivity, specific heat, and thermal diffusivity were determined and the polynomial linear models were fitted very well to experimental data. Internal and external friction properties of chickpea flour and starch and protein fractions were determined. Samples were subjected to uniaxial compression testing to determine force-time relationships. The samples’ particles underwent rearrangement rather than deformation during compression. The asymptotic modulus of samples was also computed, and it was linearly related to maximum compressive pressure. The functional properties of fractionated products were highly affected by the separation process. The water hydration capacity of starch fraction increased, whereas the emulsion capacity and foaming capacity of starch and protein fractions were reduced, compared to that of chickpea flour...|$|R

50|$|Peat was {{traditionally}} manually harvested {{by operating}} cutaway bogs. This method (still privately used today) consists of sods being vertically {{cut from the}} side face of a peat deposit. Technology was derived to mechanically cut and remove layers of peat from blanket bogs. Today, equipment is used to remove tonnes of peat each day at suitable times of year (rainfall is a significant variable in peat harvesting). Almost all the peat now harvested is milled peat, scraped {{from the surface of}} the bog by tractor-towed <b>pin</b> millers. The <b>milled</b> peat is ridged into small piles which are then transferred by harvesters into large piles running parallel along the bog. Railways are laid alongside each pile, the pile loaded into trains and the railway lifted and moved to the next pile. This is the 'Peco' method of working. A few bogs use the 'Haku' method whereby the milled peat is loaded into tractor-towed caterpillar-tracked trailers and deposited in a single heap at the edge of the bog adjacent to a railway line. Each year, the network of drainage ditches is deepened by a few inches before the next harvest.|$|R

40|$|Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) seed, {{flour and}} a protein-rich product (AP) were {{prepared}} by a dry process involving <b>pin</b> <b>milling</b> and air classification. A protein-rich product (DP) was also produced by slurry centrifugation and drum drying (wet process). The four products {{were used in}} storage studies at 64 or 79 % equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) and 37 Â°C for 6 months. Scanning electron and light microscopy showed protein particles and starch granules in the dry process products. Drum-dried DP appeared as structureless flakes. Dry processing concentrated the lipid and ash with the protein-rich fraction. The wet method reduced the quantity of free lipid in DP, (extractable with nonpolar diethyl ether). A polar solvent (chloroform/methanol, 2 : 1) removed substantial bound lipids from OP, the flour and AP. Linolenic and linoleic acids, determined by gas liquid chromatography (GLC), represented over 60 % of the total fatty acids (FA) of cowpea lipids. Before storage, the amino acid composition of the cowpea products exhibited a deficiency in methionine plus cystine and high lysine, compared to the FAO/WHO (1973) reference protein. The available lysine determined by the fluorodinitrobenzene method ranged from 94. 4 % to 98. 5 % in the cowpea products. The functional properties evaluated in the cowpea products were nitrogen solubility, water hydration capacity (WHC), oil absorption, oil emulsification and foaming. Before storage the functional properties of the flour and AP compared favorably with those of soy products. The OP had the lowest nitrogen solubility, oil emulsification and foaming properties but was highest in WHC and oil absorption among the cowpea products. During the storage trials, the moisture content of the cowpea products and the ERH remained relatively stable at 64 % ERH, both increased at 79 % ERH. Storage at 64 % ERH significantly decreased (P< 0. 05) the aerobic plate counts (APC), yeast and mold counts and bacterial spore counts of the cowpea products. At 79 % ERH the APC and yeast and mold counts of the seed significantly increased. Bacterial spores decreased. All microbial populations of the flour and AP initially decreased at 79 % ERH, then increased beyond 2 to 4 months in storage. Microbial numbers decreased in DP throughout storage at 79 % ERH but mold growth must have occurred since mycelium was present in the sample after 6 months of storage. The bacteria isolated from the stored products belonged to the genus Bacillus. Aspergillus ruber, A. amstelodami and A. chevalieri were the molds isolated from the products. All the stored products contained no aflatoxin. Lipid hydrolysis occurred in the seed, flour and AP stored at 64 % and 79 % ERH, {{as indicated by the}} increase in free fatty acids (FFA) and fat acidity. Losses later occurred in the polyunsaturated and saturated FFA of the flour and AP stored at 79 % ERH. The decline in FFA corresponded with a decrease in fat acidity and an increase in the pH. The DP was remarkably stable to lipid hydrolysis at both storage conditions, as supported by the low levels of FFA and fat acidity. Losses in the polyenoic acids of the seed, flour and AP at the two storage conditions were attributed to oxidation. Decreases in the saturated FA of the products at the high ERH were partly attributed to mold metabolism. The high lipoxygenase activities in the dry process products supported the hypothesis of lipid oxidation. Increases in the total carbonyls determined by the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assay was additional evidence of lipid oxidation of the seed, flour and AP during storage. Total carbonyls decreased during later stages of storage. The total FA of DP were stable to lipid oxidation. These results were consistent with the low TBA values and the lack of lipoxygenase in this product. Total lysine decreased in the cowpea products stored at 79 % ERH for 6 months, particularly in DP. Available lysine was also lower in the stored products especially in DP. Methionine, cystine, arginine and glutamic acid decreased in some of the stored samples. The functional properties of the flour and AP either remained unchanged or were improved after 6 months of storage at 64 % ERH. Storage at 79 % ERH reduced functionality of the products. Both conditions of storage were detrimental to the functional properties of DP. The color of the dry process products remained relatively unaltered under storage at 64 % ERH, but darkened at 79 % ERH. Darkening was pronounced in DP at both conditions of storage. A taste panel detected significant differences (P< 0. 05) between the flavor of the products stored at 64 % ERH for 6 months and their control samples. Legume and bitter were the dominant flavors of the dry process products while toasted and nutty predominated in DP...|$|R
