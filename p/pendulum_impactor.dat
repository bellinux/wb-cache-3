The {{focus of this}} research is {{the development of a new}} state of the art test and certification standard for protective headgear. Baseball helmets and soccer soft headgear were used in these tests, but the ultimate goal is to create a universal set of test guidelines for all types of protective headgear. Modifications to current test standards outlined by the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) employed the use of a <b>pendulum</b> <b>impactor,</b> which facilitated additional measurements during head impact tests using a NOCSAE headform. This additional data will allow researchers to more accurately characterize the effects of head impacts from sports related objects. This will not only serve to better characterize the effectiveness of currently available protective headgear but will also serve as a means to justify and standardize test protocols for evaluating the effectiveness of protective headgear used in sports where none is currently mandated...|$|E
40|$|Nylon {{is one of}} {{synthetic}} polymers known as polyamides. Although nylon has many advantages in terms of physical properties and mechanical properties. However the advantages of plastic nylon improvements {{need to be made}} to obtain better physical properties and mechanical properties. The combination of the two types of glass-reinforced nylon 6 and nylon fibers, generate of plastic composite materials. This study aims to analyze model and the properties of glass fiber reinforced nylon. This study used CATIA V 5 software for producing modeling of dog bone shaped specimens according to ASTM D 638 standard size. Modeling specimen are complete with feed system. Modeling the three different locations for injection of entrance door pin, the central door, and the door edge. Autodesk Moldflow Insight software is used to identify the appropriate process flow between the three different doors for the injection molding process. Then, the injection molding machine is used to produce specimens of glass fiber reinforced nylon in shaped of dog bone with different percentages of glass fiber. The percentage of glass fiber used is 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %. The temperature used to mix two materials (nylon and fiberglass) is between 230 ° C to 258 ° C. Lastly the process of studying physical properties and mechanical by using universal tensile machine and <b>pendulum</b> <b>impactor</b> machine. Universal tensile machine is used to generate the tensile stress-strain graphs for each specimen and the tensile strength for each of the tests were analyzed by using three different rates of 3 mm / min, 5 mm / min and 10 mm / min. <b>Pendulum</b> <b>impactor</b> is used to perform impact tests. Specimens according to ASTM D 4812 and the hammer 50 J used during the impact test. In conclusion, the percentage of glass fiber mixture higher achieve higher tensile stress at maximum temperature. This is because the total weight of glass fiber nylon reinforced increased as a percentage of glass fibers increases. The difference between the tensile strength of pure nylon and glass fiber reinforced scheduled and in plot in the graph...|$|E
40|$|Harvest {{operations}} are currently {{the main source}} of mechanical injury of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.). Experiments were designed to simulate conditions encountered during commercial handling. Individual fruits were subjected to impact or compression forces with similar energy to determine the sensitivity to mechanical injury. Bruise volume was used as the measurement of injury. Bruise severity increased as a function of impact energy for both impact types. However, dropped fruits had larger bruise volume than fruits submitted to <b>pendulum</b> <b>impactor</b> at the same energy level. Doubling the impact energy (0. 040 to 0. 083 J) increased bruise volume by 7 times (13 to 91 mm³). Fruits dropped from 380 mm (0. 075 J) showed 71 % greater bruise volume than those dropped from either 130 mm (0. 025 J) or 200 mm (0. 040 J). Compressed fruits showed higher bruise volume than other tests. Some cultivars are more susceptible to compression forces than others. 'Sweet Charlie' berries showed bruise volume 40 % higher than the others cultivars when subjected to compression. Fruits subjected to impact showed bruise volume lower than the compressed fruits, indicating the possibility to be handled and graded in a packing line...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with low-velocity impact of composite materials which are mainly used for aerospace applications. Infrared thermography is used with a twofold function of surface temperature mapping when the specimen is being impacted and of non destructive evaluation (NDE) technique. Several specimens were fabricated involving a polymeric matrix reinforced with carbon, or glass fibres and a fibre metal laminate (hybrid composite such as Glare®). Specimens were first non-destructively inspected with lock-in thermography to search for manufacturing defects, then impacted each at a different energy and again inspected with lock-in thermography. Impact tests were carried out with a modified Charpy <b>pendulum</b> including an <b>impactor</b> of hemispherical nose 24 mm in diameter. The impact energy was varied in the range 2 - 19 Joule by varying {{the height of the}} Charpy arm. The SC 6000 infrared camera was used to view the specimen surface opposite to impact; thermal images were acquired at 96 Hz. The obtained results show that the impact on-line monitoring supplies useful information for the material characterization. In particular, the analysis of the hot zones provides understanding of the damage origin and propagation...|$|R
40|$|Ice hockey {{has been}} {{identified}} as having one of the highest concussion rates. The three most likely causes of concussive injury are; falls to the ice, shoulder to head impacts and punches to the head. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine how these three mechanisms of injury in the sport of ice hockey influence the dynamic response of the head form and the magnitude and distribution of maximum principal strain in the cerebrum. The three impact mechanisms were simulated using a Hybrid III head and neck form attached to a linear <b>impactor,</b> <b>pendulum</b> or monorail system. Three dimensional linear and rotational acceleration data from each impact condition were used to undertake finite element modeling to calculate maximum principal strain in regions of brain tissue. The results indicated that each mechanism incurred a unique peak resultant linear and rotational acceleration response. The maximum principal strain magnitudes were found to be largest in the fall to the ice. The regions of the brain incurring the largest deformation varied per mechanism of injury. This variation of peak magnitude per brain region might explain the differences in symptomology for concussion. Furthering the understanding of these mechanisms would aid in improving the safety of the game...|$|R
40|$|Skull {{fracture}} is a frequently observed type {{of severe}} head injury. Historically, {{a variety of}} impact test set-ups and techniques {{have been used for}} investigating skull fracture. The most frequently used are the free-fall technique, the guided fall or drop tower set-up and the piston-driven impactor set-up. This document proposes a new type of set-up for cadaver head impact testing which combines the strengths of the most frequently used techniques and devices. The set-up consists of two pendulums, which allow for a 1 degree of freedom rotational motion. The first <b>pendulum</b> is the <b>impactor</b> and is used to strike the blow. The head is attached to the second pendulum using a polyester resin. Local skull deformation and impact force are measured with a sample frequency of 65 kHz. From these data, absorbed energy until skull fracture is calculated. A set-up evaluation consisting of 14 frontal skull and head impact tests shows an accurate measurement of both force and local skull deformation until fracture of the skull. Simplified mechanical models are used to analyse the different impacting techniques from literature as well as the new proposed set-up. It is concluded that the proposed test set-up is able to accurately calculate the energy absorbed by the skull until fracture with an uncertainty interval of 10 %. Second, it is concluded that skull fracture caused by blunt impact occurs before any significant motion of the head. The two-pendulum set-up is the first head impact device to allow a well-controlled measurement environment without altering the skull stress distribution. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The WorldSID {{program was}} set up to develop a new, {{worldwide}} acceptable, advanced technology, side impact crash test dummy for improved assessment of injury risk to car occupants in lateral collisions. Following the release of the mid-sized male WorldSID, the development of the small female WorldSID dummy was initiated by the EC 6 th Framework collaborative research project ‘APROSYS’ in 2004. The main specifications and requirements of the new dummy have been defined in terms of anthropometry, biomechanical response and instrumentation capabilities in general and per body segment. An overview of the specification is given in this paper. Two prototype dummies have been evaluated against a first set of test conditions. Test results are presented here, including <b>pendulum</b> <b>impactor,</b> linearly guided impactor, drop and sled tests. For a prioritised matrix of biomechanical test conditions, the dummy responses were compared against the biomechanical human response requirements. Furthermore, the dummy’s repeatability in well-controlled test conditions and its sensitivity to temperature were studied and its compliance to anthropometric requirements is reported. Following the assessment of the dummy’s current biofidelity and maturity, recommendations for further dummy improvements are given in the conclusions...|$|E
40|$|In modern-day architecture, {{transparent}} glass units are omnipresent as large façades, windows, floors and balustrades. To ensure safety in an accident, glass panels must successfully pass the 'human impact' test, {{described by the}} international standard EN 12600. This test setup consists of a steel frame in which the test plate is clamped with prescribed force; and the <b>pendulum</b> <b>impactor,</b> hanging from a steel cable. The impactor weighs a total 50 kg and is built up from a rigid steel core to which two small tyres are mounted. The window panels are assigned a qualification number as they remain intact, fracture without losing integrity or fragment completely in impacts from different drop heights. As experimental testing is expensive and time-consuming, there is an interest in numerical modelling to predict a qualifying glass panel, which is already allowed by the German standard DIN 18008 - 4. Several modelling approaches allow the impact simulation for intact glass panels. This paper presents a detailed numerical model for the pendulum impact which enables realistic simulation of impactor, frame and test plate, to be valid also for the post-breakage safety assessment of laminated glass. The model shows good correspondence for static compression of the tyres and for impact against a pressure plate. Further comparison is made for the impact on a laminated glass panel that remains intact. Although less suited for structural design qualification, the detailed model {{can be used for}} future simulation of the post-breakage response of laminated glass panels...|$|E
40|$|With {{a growing}} use of {{composite}} materials in aircraft structures, {{there is a}} greater need to understand the response of these materials to low velocity impacts. Low velocity impacts from tool drops or ground equipment collisions can be of varying bluntness and can leave little or no visible evidence of damage. Therefore, a need exists to investigate the initiation of internal damage and the relationship between this internal damage and the external visible damage with respect to the bluntness of the impactor. A <b>pendulum</b> <b>impactor</b> was used to impact 76. 2 x 127 mm carbon/epoxy panels that were 8, 16, and 24 plies thick. The panels were impacted by hardened steel tips with radii of 12. 7 to 76. 2 mm. The experimental results show that the failure threshold energies for each panel thickness and tip radius combination occur at a distinct and consistent energy. This threshold increases with impactor bluntness, and this effect is greater for the 8 ply panel than it is for the 16 or 24 ply panels. To describe the visibility of impact damage, the area of delamination was compared to the depth of the dents resulting from the impacts. For the sharper impact tips, there is a clear relationship between the delamination area and the depth of the dents. However, these relationships are dependent on the radius of the impact tip, and for the blunter impact tips no strong correlation could be determined between the delamination area and the depth of the dent...|$|E
40|$|As {{composites}} {{are increasingly}} used for primary structures in commercial aircrafts, {{it is necessary}} to understand damage initiation for composites subject to low velocity impacts from service conditions, maintenance, and other ground equipment mishaps. In particular, collisions with ground vehicles can present a wide area, blunt impact. Therefore, the effects of bluntness of an impactor are of interest as this is related to both the external visual detectability of an impact event, as well as the development of internal damage in the laminate. The objective of this investigation is to determine the effect of impactor radius on the initiation of damage to composite panels. A <b>pendulum</b> <b>impactor</b> was used to strike 200 mm square woven glass/epoxy composite plates of 3. 18 mm and 6. 35 mm thicknesses. Hemispherical steel tips with radius 12. 7 mm to 152. 4 mm were mounted to a piezoelectric force sensor which measures the contact force history. Impacts were conducted with and without rubber bumpers to mimic the bumpers used on ground vehicles. Strain gauges were mounted to select panels. Experimental data show distinct threshold energy for the onset of delamination and fiber breakage. These energy levels increase with increasing tip radius. Strain increases with decreasing tip radius. Strains at the panel center are less affected by the presence of rubber bumpers with increasing tip radius. Finite element simulations match the experimentally measured contact force and strain data. Curved FE panels show peak contact forces independent of impactor radius and incident angle. In-plane compressive stresses decrease with increasing radius tips and incident angl...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increased}} desire to incorporate more composite sandwich structures into modern aircrafts. Because in- service aircrafts routinely experience impact damage during maintenance due to ground vehicle collision, dropped equipment, or {{foreign object damage}} (FOD) impact, {{it is necessary to}} understand their impact characteristics, particularly when blunt impact sources create internal damage with little or no external visibility. The objective of this investigation is to explore damage formation in lightweight composite sandwich panels due to low-velocity impacts of variable tip radius and energy level. The correlation between barely visible external dent formation and internal core damage was explored as a function of impact tip radius. A <b>pendulum</b> <b>impactor</b> was used to impact composite sandwich panels having honeycomb core while held in a 165 mm square window fixture. The panels were impacted by hardened steel tips with radii of 12. 7, 25. 4, 50. 8, and 76. 2 mm at energy levels ranging from 2 to 14 J. Experimental data showed little dependence of external dent depth on tip radius at very low energies of 2 to 6 J, and thus, there was also little variation in visibility due to tip radius. Four modes of internal core damage were identified. Internal damage span and depth were dependent on impact tip radius. Damage depth was also radius-dependent, but stabilized at constant depth independent of kinetic energy. Internal damage sp{{an increased}} with increasing impact energy, but not with increasing tip radius, suggesting a relationship between maximum damage tip radius with core density/siz...|$|E
