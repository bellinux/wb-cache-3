500|$|Coulton Waugh {{attempted}} {{the first}} comprehensive history of American comics with The Comics (1947). [...] Will Eisner's Comics and Sequential Art (1985) and Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics (1993) were early attempts in English to formalize the study of comics. [...] David Carrier's The Aesthetics of Comics (2000) was the first full-length treatment of comics from a philosophical perspective. [...] Prominent American attempts at definitions of comics include Eisner's, McCloud's, and Harvey's. [...] Eisner described what he called [...] "sequential art" [...] as [...] "the arrangement of pictures or images and words to narrate a story or dramatize an idea"; [...] Scott McCloud defined comics as [...] "juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer", a strictly formal definition which detached comics from its historical and cultural trappings. [...] R.C. Harvey defined comics as [...] "pictorial narratives or expositions in which words (often lettered into the <b>picture</b> <b>area</b> within speech balloons) usually contribute {{to the meaning of}} the pictures and vice versa". [...] Each definition has had its detractors. [...] Harvey saw McCloud's definition as excluding single-panel cartoons, [...] and objected to McCloud's de-emphasizing verbal elements, insisting [...] "the essential characteristic of comics is the incorporation of verbal content". [...] Aaron Meskin saw McCloud's theories as an artificial attempt to legitimize the place of comics in art history.|$|E
2500|$|The miniatures {{normally}} {{occupy a}} full page, later sometimes spreading across two pages to regain a square or horizontal [...] "landscape" [...] format. There are often panels of text or captions inside the <b>picture</b> <b>area,</b> which is enclosed in a frame, eventually [...] of several ruled lines with a broader band of gold or colour. [...] The {{rest of the}} page is often decorated with dense designs {{of plants and animals}} in a muted grisaille, often gold and brown; text pages without miniatures often also have such borders. [...] In later manuscripts, elements of the miniature begin to expand beyond the frame, which may disappear {{on one side of the}} image, or be omitted completely.|$|E

40|$|A novel, {{automatic}} restoration {{framework of}} large <b>picture</b> <b>areas</b> is proposed in this paper. While the damaged <b>picture</b> <b>areas</b> {{may have been}} caused by accident or transmission loss, the challenge consists in repairing the occluded or missing image regions in an undetectable way. In this work, the new inpainting method is used as framework for systematic evaluation of relevant structure extrapolation strategies. The important issue of quality-complexity optimization is thoroughly discussed and efficient inpainting tools are established. Recovery of missing dominant structures is done via tensor voting, regression analysis or a combination of both. Combined structure extrapolation considerably reduces the complexity of structure restoration, compared to genuine tensor voting, with overall graceful to imperceptible degradation of the inpainting result. Furthermore, limitations of the tensor voting approach can be avoided by means of polynomial interpolation with additional sav ings in terms of complexity...|$|R

Double-perf 16 mm film, the original format, has a perforation at {{both sides of}} every frame line. Single-perf is perforated at one side only, making room for an optical or magnetic soundtrack along the other side.|$|R

The interior decorations of the theater are everything that has been claimed for them... the lighting system is unique for a playhouse in this city, the screen is exceptionally large and the <b>picture</b> <b>areas</b> as clear as life." [...] To accompany the silent films, the theater had a large organ with a full-time organist.|$|R
5000|$|Note on the {{progressive}} recording modeIn a normal TV broadcast, {{the screen is}} divided into 2 finer fields and these are displayed in turn, every 1/60 of a second.

50|$|The film is {{currently}} in need of restoration, including framing and color correction. Video prints are notoriously bright, particularly for Mombi's decapitation sequence. The framing {{may no longer be}} correctable, because the area used for the soundtrack in contemporary films was part of the <b>picture</b> <b>area</b> at the time, though it is a noticeable defect in contemporary presentations of the film. Prints that have not been re-struck in this cropping manner may no longer exist.|$|E
50|$|It {{was then}} {{forbidden}} for broadcasters to transmit the chroma burst signal, until the designated day, 1 March 1975. The broadcasters {{were allowed to}} experiment with transmitting colour signals in the <b>picture</b> <b>area,</b> and get their transmission up and running while people who had already bought colour TV sets could only watch the shows {{in black and white}} monochrome. There were some people who built a circuit to circumvent this, where they would synchronise the chrominance decoding oscillator manually.|$|E
50|$|Siddell's realist {{paintings}} are identified mainly with {{depictions of the}} environs of Auckland.

5000|$|In 1953, the {{introduction}} of CinemaScope—with its wider <b>picture</b> <b>area</b> and its use of four-track magnetic sound (four strips of magnetic tape coated on the film)—required another type of perforation.

These perfs are {{commonly referred to as}} CinemaScope (CS) or [...] "Fox hole" [...] perforations, or simply [...] "Foxholes" [...] (because, initially, all CinemaScope films were made by 20th Century Fox).

50|$|For the T90, Canon {{developed}} their most sophisticated light-metering system yet. Although it introduced no novel metering techniques, it assembled {{the majority of}} the metering techniques then developed into one easy-to-use system. First, it took the metering options from the New F-1—center-weighted average metering, partial area metering, and spot metering—and makes them available with a press of a button and a turn of the command dial. The New F-1 requires a focusing screen change to switch metering patterns. On the T90, partial area metering uses the center 13% of the <b>picture</b> <b>area,</b> while spot metering uses the center 2.7%.|$|E
50|$|Geer {{continued}} {{to work on his}} basic concept for some time, as well as other television related concepts. In 1955 he filed a patent on a flat TV tube that used a gun arranged to lie beside the image area that fired upward towards the top. The beam was deflected through 90 degrees by a series of charged wires so the beam was now traveling horizontally across the back of the <b>picture</b> <b>area.</b> A second grid, located beside the first, then bent the beams through a small angle so they hit the back of the screen.|$|E
