This fact remains one of the biggest {{stumbling}} blocks when analysing evidence for court presentation. It has been demonstrated that the reliability of <b>pattern</b> <b>association</b> analysis will not be affected by minimal degrees of warping, shrinkage and distortion. In this study affine transformations were applied to bite marks to establish if minimal distortions would affect the mathematically determined relationships of the defined features. In a real case study, it was then tested whether the distorted bite marks match the dentition of the perpetrator by applying an affine transformation. This was confirmed to be the case. Affine transformations will thus not affect the relationships of the individual features found in bite marks. The numerical calculations validate the reliability of <b>pattern</b> <b>association</b> analysis in the presence of minimal amounts of warping, shrinkage and distortion...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of forensic odontology regularly requires the forensic dental expert {{to establish a}} degree of concordance between two objects, {{one or both of}} which have undergone minimal degrees of warping, shrinkage and distortion collectively described as deformations. These comparisons can be between the suspect’s or victim’s dentition and bite marks on inanimate objects/skin, two radiological images, palatal rugae patterns, dental arches, lip prints and other unique scenarios which are presented in forensic odontological cases. This paper will define the mathematical concept of affine transformation as it pertains to forensic matters and explains how it can be applied to a case study involving pattern deformations. Although the deformation of the evidence may be minimal in extent, it creates a measure of uncertainty when expert evidence is given in court cases. Any metric discrepancy caused by deformation of the evidence will necessitate the application of <b>pattern</b> <b>association</b> and negate the use of metric analysis. It has been shown that a <b>pattern</b> <b>association</b> analysis of evidence will not be affected by minimal amounts of deformation. The mathematical limits of these deformations which will significantly affect the comparisons have not yet been determined. In the case study presented the deformations were considered minimal and thus explainable by a <b>pattern</b> <b>association</b> analysis. The mathematical concepts will empower the expert to explain to a court of law how two samples which were not a perfect match, could in fact be deformed equivalents of common origin...|$|E

Besides traditional attributes association with point, line and plane, the model also can fully and flexibly express temporal association, orientation association, and topology association, namely, it can quickly and simply form multi-dimensional spatiotemporal <b>association</b> <b>patterns.</b> And then for the star association model based on event, an algorithm of discovering frequent spatiotemporal <b>association</b> <b>patterns</b> based on granular computing is proposed, which is different from traditional <b>association</b> <b>patterns</b> mining algorithms.

40|$|The {{recall of}} {{information}} {{stored in the}} hippocampus involves a series of corticocortical backprojections via the entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and one or more neocortical stages. Each stage {{is considered to be}} a <b>pattern</b> <b>association</b> network, with the retrieval cue at each stage the firing of neurons in the previous stage. The leading factor that determines the capacity of this multistage <b>pattern</b> <b>association</b> backprojection pathway is the number of connections onto any one neuron, which provides a quantitative basis for why there are as many backprojections between adjacent stages in the hierarchy as forward projections. The issue arises of why this multistage backprojection system uses diluted connectivity. One reason is that a multistage backprojection system with expansion of neuron numbers at each stage enables the hippocampus to address during recall the very large numbers of neocortical neurons, which would otherwise require hippocampal neurons to make very large numbers of synapses if they were directly onto neocortical neurons. The second reason is that as shown here, diluted connectivity in the backprojection pathways reduces the probability of more than one connection onto a receiving neuron in the backprojecting pathways, which otherwise reduces the capacity of the system, that is the number of memories that can be recalled from the hippocampus to the neocortex. For similar reasons, diluted connectivity is advantageous in <b>pattern</b> <b>association</b> networks in other brain systems such as the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala; for related reasons, in autoassociation networks in, for example, the hippocampal CA 3 and the neocortex; and for the different reason that diluted connectivity facilitates the operation of competitive networks in forward-connected cortical systems...|$|E
