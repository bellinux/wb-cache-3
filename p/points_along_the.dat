The standard deviation of the Gaussian should be chosen to be small enough that, after this step, the sample points still have nearly-uniform spacing.|$|E

5|$|For {{some species}} of waders, {{migration}} success {{depends on the}} availability of certain key food resources at stopover <b>points</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> migration route. This gives the migrants an opportunity to refuel for the next leg of the voyage. Some examples of important stopover locations are the Bay of Fundy and Delaware Bay.|$|E
5|$|In the 1780s the Royal Humane Society {{installed}} resuscitation kits, including smoke enemas, {{at various}} <b>points</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> River Thames, {{and by the}} turn of the 19th century, tobacco smoke enemas had become an established practice in Western medicine, considered by Humane Societies to be as important as artificial respiration.|$|E
5|$|Shorter and quicker {{routes to}} the top of Helvellyn, though with less {{attractive}} scenery, begin from several <b>points</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> A591 road along {{the west side of the}} mountain. Two of these may be combined to create a circular walk. Incorporating the south ridge in the route can restore much of the scenic interest.|$|E

5|$|Substantial {{sections}} of the Kolonnenweg remain in place to serve as farm and forestry access roads, though the accompanying anti-vehicle ditches, fences and other obstacles have been almost entirely removed. Artworks, commemorative stones, memorials and signs have been erected at many <b>points</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> former border to mark its opening, to remember its victims and to record the division and reunification of Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Defense Communications Planning Group's {{research}} and development program created an advanced technological system. Muscle Shoals would consist of three interdependent parts. First, there were air-dropped, battery-powered acoustic and seismic sensors. The camouflaged sensors were to be dropped in strings at predetermined geographical <b>points</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> PAVN logistical network. Once emplaced, they would serve as tripwires to any movement or activity along the system.|$|E
5|$|They based its grid-like street plan on Philadelphia's, with {{numbered}} north-south streets running inland {{from the}} river after River Street, the city's first commercial center. Lots there, at the time, ran {{all the way to}} the river's waterline, giving their owners the unusual advantage of river and street frontage. The sloping bluff also allowed them to build multi-story warehouses and granaries closer to the unloading <b>points</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> river.|$|E

5|$|Anglers {{will find}} pike {{in excess of}} , with good stocks of chub, dace, roach, bream, tench, perch, rudd, and gudgeon. There are trout in the upper reaches. There are several access <b>points</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> river {{suitable}} for canoeing, and the river has been paddled as far up as Bruton, but above West Lydford only after recent rain. There are public footpaths alongside many stretches of the river. There are also areas of the river that serve as desirable spots for wild swimming.|$|E
5|$|From a {{starting}} point on the frontier, {{if there is no}} increase in productive resources, increasing production of a first good entails decreasing production of a second, because resources must be transferred to the first and away from the second. <b>Points</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> curve describe the tradeoff between the goods. The sacrifice in the production of the second good is called the opportunity cost (because increasing production of the first good entails losing the opportunity to produce some amount of the second). Opportunity cost is measured in the number of units of the second good forgone for one or more units of the first good.|$|E
5|$|Most non-Republican Guard armored units had older tank designs, {{mainly the}} T-55 or its Chinese equivalents, the Type 59 and Type 69. The {{remaining}} 34 divisions were composed of poorly trained conscripts. These divisions were deployed to channel the Coalition's forces {{through a number}} of break <b>points</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> front, allowing the Iraqi Army's heavy divisions and the Republican Guard units to isolate them and counterattack. However, the Iraqis left their western flank open, failing to account for tactics made possible by the Global Positioning System and other new technologies.|$|E

5|$|OTA {{announced}} plans to include sound barriers at three <b>points</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> turnpike in April 1990. The locations were recommended by a report commissioned by OTA, using guidelines published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). While another thirteen locations were likely to have similar noise levels as the three sites selected to receive barriers, abatement was not considered at those locations {{because they did not}} meet other criteria, including minimum population density. Although OTA was not required to follow FHWA guidelines on the Creek Turnpike because it was not a federally funded project, it opted to do so anyway.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{contract}} was awarded, {{the start of the}} American Civil War caused the stage line to cease operation. From March 1861, the Pony Express ran mail only between Salt Lake City and Sacramento. The Pony Express announced its closure on October 26, 1861, two days after the transcontinental telegraph reached Salt Lake City and connected Omaha, Nebraska, and Sacramento, California. Other telegraph lines connected <b>points</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> line and other cities on the east and west coasts.|$|E
5|$|The Trans-Canada Highway, {{passing through}} Banff, has been problematic, posing hazards for {{wildlife}} due to vehicle traffic {{and as an}} impediment to wildlife migration. Grizzly bears are among the species impacted by the highway, which together with other developments in Banff, has caused fragmentation of the landscape. Grizzly bears prefer the montane habitat, which has been most impacted by development. Wildlife crossings, including a series of underpasses, and six wildlife overpasses, have been constructed {{at a number of}} <b>points</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Trans-Canada Highway to help alleviate this problem.|$|E

5|$|The defences at Sedan also lacked any mines. The French Second Army was {{guarding}} a {{front of}} , {{and was given}} only 16,000 mines. Of that number, 7,000 {{were given to the}} cavalry divisions that were intended to delay a German advance through southern Belgium as well as to blockhouse <b>points</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Franco–Belgian border. That left 2,000 for the defence of the river Meuse. Of those, the 55th Infantry Division got 422. Not all of these were laid, and some barriers were moved during the bunker construction in the Sedan sector.|$|E
5|$|This {{training}} was {{in preparation for}} the 2nd New Zealand Division's role in the upcoming Operation Crusader, which was planned to lift the siege of Tobruk. The New Zealanders were {{to be one of the}} 8th Army's infantry divisions that were to surround and capture the main strong <b>points</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> front while the armoured divisions were to seek out and engage Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps. At the same time, the Tobruk garrison was to attempt a breakout.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the extreme}} {{difficulty}} of the competition, several stages of preparation are needed. The first is the food drop, when mushers and race officials position caches of food and supplies at race checkpoints. This is necessary because mushers may only use their supplies along the route, reflecting the Gold Rush era, when dog trains would resupply at <b>points</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> trail. One week after the food drop, all dogs participating in the race undergo a preliminary veterinarian inspection to ensure they are healthy enough to race 1,000miles in subarctic conditions. The final stage of formal preparation is {{two days before the}} race, when mushers pick their starting order from a hat.|$|E
