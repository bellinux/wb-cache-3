40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore {{the time course of}} a lane change in terms of the driver's control and eye-movement behavior. We {{conducted}} an experiment in which drivers navigated a simulated multi-lane highway environment in a fixed-base, medium-fidelity driving simulator. We then segmented the driver data into standardized units of time to facilitate an analysis of behavior before, during, and after a lane change. Results of this analysis showed that (1) drivers produced the expected sine-wave steering pattern except for a longer and flatter second peak as they straightened the vehicle; (2) drivers decelerated slightly before a <b>pass</b> <b>lane</b> change, accelerated soon after the lane change, and maintained the higher speed up until the onset of the return lane change; (3) drivers had their turn signals on only 50 % of the time at lane-change onset, reaching a 90 % rate only 1. 5 - 2 seconds after onset; (4) drivers shifted their eye movements from the start lane to the destination lane immediately after the onset of the lane change. These results will {{serve as the basis for}} future development of a new integrated model of driver behavior...|$|E

40|$|The use of periodic, {{short-term}} <b>passing</b> <b>lanes</b> {{is known}} in Texas as a “Super 2 ” design. The <b>passing</b> <b>lanes</b> may be alternating or side-by-side, but they are placed at regular intervals. <b>Passing</b> <b>lanes</b> are often constructed on two-lane roadways to improve overall traffic operations by breaking up traffic platoons and by reducing delays caused by inadequate passing opportunities over substantial lengths of roadway. During the recent design of several “Super 2 ” projects, questions arose in three areas: 1) optimum <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> length and spacing, 2) shoulder width requirements, and 3) optimum signing and driver information (pavement marking, etc.) strategies. The objective of this project was to develop Super 2 design criteria in a format suitable {{for inclusion in the}} TxDOT Roadway Design Manual.

40|$|An {{investigation}} into platooning and passing maneuvers within a <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> section on a rural two-lane, two-way highway was considered in this study. The study site was located on US Highway 287 between {{the town of}} Townsend and the City of Helena {{in the state of}} Montana. Traffic volumes at study site, while considered relatively low, were typical on two-lane highways in many rural states. Per-lane analysis of performance measures and lane utilization (volume split) were used to indirectly examine <b>passing</b> maneuvers and <b>lane</b> changing at successive locations within the <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> section. For the case study site, it was evident that traffic performance became relatively stable beyond half a mile into the <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> for the traffic volumes investigated. Therefore, results strongly suggested that most passing maneuvers already took place before the 0. 5 -mile station and that the actual <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> length was well beyond the optimal length required for breaking up platoons and improving performance...|$|R

The operational performance of a two-lane, two-way rural highway is often measured with percent time delay. At moderate to high Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) values, two-lane, two-way rural highways with no <b>passing</b> <b>lanes</b> often tend to experience operational difficulties due to inadequate passing opportunities leading to an increase in the percent time delay and also increasing the risk of crashes due to potential dangerous overtaking maneuvers attempted by some motorists. This research focused on obtaining the optimal design length and spacing of <b>passing</b> <b>lanes</b> on two-lane, two-way rural highways, for various two-way volumes. Research was conducted using the microscopic computer simulation package TWOPAS, an FHWA software that simulates two-lane, two-way highways under a wide variety of conditions. The measure of effectiveness (MOE) used for this research was percent time delay. The simulation results indicated that percent time delay increased with increasing two-way volume and spacing between <b>passing</b> <b>lanes,</b> and the percent time delay decreased with increasing <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> length and percentage of roadway four-laned. However, there seemed to be no specific relationship between percent time delay and truck percentage in the traffic stream. During the research it was also discovered that TWOPAS did not perform as expected with regards to increasing truck percentage in the traffic stream. It was observed that at high volume conditions and certain road configurations the percent time delay value actually decreased with increasing truck percentage. A discussion of this finding is also included in the thesis. Having established the relationship between percent time delay and two-way volume, percent trucks in the traffic stream, length of <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> section, spacing of <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> section and percentage of roadway four-laned, two models were developed which were then used to arrive at the optimal length and spacing of <b>passing</b> <b>lanes</b> for given two-way volumes. This research dealt with <b>passing</b> <b>lanes</b> on two-lane roads in flat terrain and did not consider the effects of grades, both horizontal and vertical, and as such the percent time delay values were found to be lower than might be expected in field. This thesis also includes recommendations for issues to be addressed in future research...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For an {{efficient}} seaport terminal, we propose a novel operational model, namely, a double container-handling operation among operating machines, such as automated guided vehicles (AGVs), automated transfer cranes (ATCs), and quay container cranes (QCCs), in a seaport terminal system. In addition, a <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> {{is provided in}} a container storage yard in order to activate the container-handling operation by the AGVs and ATCs. In this paper, {{the effect of the}} double container-handling operation and <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> on the system utilization is examined.

40|$|AbstractThere {{are three}} {{sections}} in two-lane roads: no-passing section in which passing is prohibited in both directions; passing section allowing partial passing; added lane (either {{left or right}} of driving <b>lane,</b> defined as <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> section in this study) designed for partial passing. Relative congestion in <b>passing</b> <b>lanes</b> or sections allowing passing can be calculated by quantifying delay in no-passing section in two-lane roads and this {{could serve as a}} valuable reference material if it contributes to better traffic conditions. This study established congestion model in no-passing section by performing regression analysis with field survey data retrieved from 88 Olympic Expressway, ran TWOPAS, which is traffic flow analysis program in two-lane roads, developed congestion estimation model in passing sections by simulating many <b>passing</b> <b>lanes</b> with different length, and finally analysed congestion reduction in <b>passing</b> <b>lanes</b> compared to no-passing lanes by different length. The analysis found USHCM 2000 's linear model to be a more reliable estimation model for PTSF, which indicates congestion in two-lane roads than non-linear model. The appropriate length of <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> should be more than 2. 0 km when there is heavy traffic (1, 000 vph) as indicated by applying model formula derived in this study to TWOPAS model. In this case, congestion reduced by an average of 23 % compared to no-passing section. Furthermore, 1. 5 km in length of passing section can also turn out to be effective for softening congestion...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of <b>passing</b> <b>lanes</b> on traffic flow on a single-lane highway are {{investigated}} based on a cellular-automaton (CA) model proposed by Lee et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 238702 (2004)) with periodic boundary conditions. A new driving strategy for the diverging and interacting processes are proposed by considering dual-time-headways (an interaction headway and a safe headway) as the criteria for a vehicle to select a lane or change lane. The proposed dual-headway rule has a clear physical sense and can be calibrated in the real world. We can see that (i) At low- (or high-) density, there are no obvious increases of flux due to very weak (or very strong) interactions between vehicles. However, flux has an obvious increase at intermediate-density regions {{with the increase of}} the length of a passing lane; (ii) The space-time patterns before a <b>passing</b> <b>lane</b> are different from that after a <b>passing</b> <b>lane,</b> which is caused from vehicular reconfigurations on a passing zone; (iii) <b>Passing</b> <b>lanes</b> can merge several narrow jams into one or few wide jams when increasing the length of passing lanes; (iv) If vehicles are allowed to travel with even higher speed, traffic can be further improved...|$|R
