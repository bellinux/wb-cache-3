40|$|Osmotic <b>pressure</b> <b>maintained</b> by liver or kidney tissue {{measured}} by its water equilibrium with solutions of sodium chloride remains unchanged from 5 minutes up to 1 ½ hours following {{removal of the}} tissue from the body. Then with autolytic increase of molecular concentration within the cytoplasm of cells it reaches a higher level. Osmotic <b>pressure</b> <b>maintained</b> by pancreas or submaxillary gland, as ascertained in the same way, remains unchanged during ½ hour and later increases. Liver tissue of rat, mouse, guinea pig, rabbit, and cat <b>maintains</b> an osmotic <b>pressure</b> greater than twice that of the blood, and kidney tissue <b>maintains</b> an osmotic <b>pressure</b> somewhat less than twice that of blood. Fasting throughout a period of 7 days has little influence upon osmotic <b>pressure</b> <b>maintained</b> by cells of liver or kidney. Low protein diet {{has been found to}} depress osmotic pressure of liver cells after about 4 weeks, and with degenerative changes in the parenchyma, notably fatty infiltration, this pressure has remained at a diminished level during approximately 90 days. Increase of pressure within the common bile duct and the changes following biliary obstruction are accompanied by depression of the osmotic <b>pressure</b> <b>maintained</b> by liver tissue and ligation of the ureter diminishes the osmotic <b>pressure</b> <b>maintained</b> by kidney tissue. In both instances osmotic pressure tends later to rise to its former level.

50|$|To reach higher altitudes, a {{pressurized}} cockpit {{was added}} to the H models. The canopy was sealed via a circular tube filled with rubber foam which was inflated by a compressed air bottle, while the engine compartment was also sealed from the cockpit with a rubber foam ring.

To prevent fogging, the windscreen was of a double-glazed style with a 6 mm (.236 in) thick outer pane and a 3 mm (.118 in) inner pane with a 6 mm (.24 in) gap. The gap was fitted with several silica gel capsules to absorb any moisture forming between the panes. The cockpit was not pressurized in the C models.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, {{scientists}} sampled DNA {{from both}} light- and dark-coloured rock pocket mice from areas in Pinacate Peaks, Mexico and New Mexico, USA. In the Pinacate mice, they discovered a perfect association between {{different versions of}} the Melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc41r6) gene and coat colour [...] Subsequent studies demonstrated that there is strong selective <b>pressure</b> <b>maintaining</b> Mc1r allele and coat colour frequencies across the short geographic distances between the light- and dark-coloured rock islands. Thus melanism in rock pocket mice is considered a fabulous example of adaptation by natural selection. Changes in the Mc1r gene sequence are not responsible for the colour difference in the mice sampled from New Mexico, however, leading the researchers to conclude that the almost identical dark coat colours developed multiple times in rock pocket mice, an example of convergent evolution.|$|E
50|$|The ICU {{recovery}} involves several challenges. Some patients get significant reperfusion pulmonary edema, {{at places}} where thrombi were removed, et al., 1986 {{and thus have}} less than ideal oxygen saturation values. This results because with the thrombus removal the surgeon strips out the pulmonary endothelium. The challenge for the ICU physician thus is getting the extra {{water out of the}} lungs, (for which they make use of the strong diuretic furosemide) to get decent oxygen saturation values, yet maintain the blood <b>pressure.</b> <b>Maintaining</b> these two parameters can be a challenge. Maintaining a good oxygen saturation can be accomplished by running the patient dry (with a diuretic) and setting a high BiPAP (bidirectional positive airway pressure). However, a high BiPAP tends to leads to poor venous return, which causes a decrease in blood pressure. Adding volume would increase blood pressure, but would this worsens the edema so it is generally avoided. Adding albumin does not help; the pulmonary arteries are too porous post-operation. With these described limitations of the available interventions, a delicate balance is required between the BiPAP setting and diuretic dosing to maintain proper blood pressure and oxygen saturation.|$|E

40|$|Today’s {{high lift}} systems of civil {{transport}} aircraft {{are driven by}} Power Control Units using valve controlled constant displacement hydraulic motors. This concept leads to com-plex valve blocks, attended by high power losses to realise discrete speed control, positioning and <b>pressure</b> <b>maintaining</b> functionality. The concept of secondary controlled hydraulic motors with variable displacement offers reduction in flow consumption without pressure losses and decreases {{the complexity of the}} valve block design. Instead of controlling flow of the hydraulic motor with valves, torque is adjusted to the load by varying displacement. An electronic control circuit allows flexible digital control concepts e. g. load independent speed control, <b>pressure</b> <b>maintaining</b> function-ality, smooth start-up sequences and continuous positioning of the mechanical transmission system. This paper introduces the concept of today’s Power Control Units, the principle and mathematical model of secondary controlled hydraulic motors and the cascade control loop structure. A new hydraulic concept for Power Control Units using secondary controlled hydraulic motors is presented. Theoretical, simulated and experimental results show typical operation sequences under load and a comparison of power requirement to conventional systems.

30|$|Anthocyanins are {{the largest}} group of {{water-soluble}} pigments in the plant kingdom and are abundant in fruits, vegetables, beans, and red wine. Dietary anthocyanins have been shown {{to play an important role}} in the prevention of life-related common diseases, mainly as a result of their strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (Desjardins et al. 2012;Cuevas-Rodríguez et al. 2010). Anthocyanins improve the peripheral circulatory system by lowering blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>maintaining</b> the proper permeability and elasticity of arterial vessels, and activate nitric oxide (NO) to promote endothelial vasodilation (Jennings et al. 2012;Ojeda et al. 2010;Côrtes et al. 2002). In addition, several animal studies have shown that specific anthocyanins improve metabolism-associated thermogenesis in peripheral organs (DeFuria et al. 2009;Takikawa et al. 2010). Therefore, such dietary factors may be effective in improving cold constitution in humans.|$|E

5000|$|Prokaryotic sex {{also appears}} to be an {{adaptation}} to stress. For instance, transformation occurs near the end of logarithmic growth, when amino acids become limiting in Bacillus subtilis, or in Haemophilus influenzae when cells are grown to the end of logarithmic phase. [...] In Streptococcus mutans and other streptococci, transformation is associated with high cell density and biofilm formation. [...] In Streptococcus pneumoniae, transformation is induced by the DNA damaging agent mitomycin C. These, and other, examples indicate that prokaryotic sex, like meiosis in simple eukaryotes, is an adaptation to stressful conditions. This observation suggests that the natural selection <b>pressures</b> <b>maintaining</b> meiosis in eukaryotes are similar to the selective <b>pressures</b> <b>maintaining</b> prokaryotic sex.

40|$|Several {{families}} of homeobox genes {{are arranged in}} genomic clusters in metazoan genomes, including the Hox, ParaHox, NK, Rhox, and Iroquois gene clusters. The selective pressures responsible for maintenance of these gene clusters are poorly understood. The ParaHox gene cluster is evolutionarily conserved between amphioxus and human but is fragmented in teleost fishes. We show that two basal ray-finned fish, Polypterus and Amia, each possess an intact ParaHox cluster; this implies that the selective <b>pressure</b> <b>maintaining</b> clustering was lost after whole-genome duplication in teleosts. Cluster breakup is because of gene loss, not transposition or inversion, and {{the total number of}} ParaHox genes is the same in teleosts, human, mouse, and frog.

40|$|Fuzzy control; Process control Abstract. Pressurization controlsystemplays an {{important}} role in the process control at the stages of riser-tube filling, mold-filling, pressure-increasing and <b>pressure</b> <b>maintaining</b> in counter-gravity casting. Casting quality is affected by theprecision of pressurization control systemto a great extent. Input and output scaling factors of conventional fuzzy controller are static, which is hard to ensure a suitable state for variouscounter-gravity casting equipments. A new fuzzy controller with self-tuning scaling factors has been developedin our laboratory, which will be described in this paper. Input and output scaling factors of fuzzy controller are tuned by different error ranges. When the differential pressure error is large, output scaling factor is increased to speed up dynamic response. At the same time, input scaling factors are also increased in order to reduce steady state error. Compared to fuzzy controller and conventional PID controller, fuzzy-PID controller with self-tuning scaling factors has more steady-state precision and excellent robustness. Experimental results show that at riser-tube filling stage and mold-filling stage the gas flow is stable, and the tracking property of pressurization control systemis very satisfactory...|$|E

40|$|Retroposition is a {{widespread}} phenomenon resulting in the generation of new genes that are initially related to a parent gene via very high coding sequence similarity. We examine the evolutionary fate of four retrogenes generated by such an event; mouse Inpp 5 f_v 2, Mcts 2, Nap 1 l 5, and U 2 af 1 -rs 1. These genes are all subject to the epigenetic phenomenon of parental imprinting. We first provide new data on the age of these retrogene insertions. Using codon-based models of sequence evolution, we show these retrogenes have diverse evolutionary trajectories, including divergence from the parent coding sequence under positive selection pressure, purifying selection <b>pressure</b> <b>maintaining</b> parent-retrogene similarity, and neutral evolution. Examination of the expression pattern of retrogenes shows an atypical, broad pattern across multiple tissues.

The results demonstrated that steam explosion could effectively decrease the carbohydrate content of lignin liquor and the operational parameters of steam pressure 1. 8 MPa and <b>pressure</b> <b>maintaining</b> time 5 min were obtained as preferable conditions for less carbohydrate content and higher lignin yield. The lignin methylolated under optimized conditions was found to successfully substitute 50 % of phenolic resin as wood adhesive with approved bonding strength and lower free formaldehyde and phenol contents. The FOR and GPC analysis suggested that lignin showed higher content of carbonyl group and narrower molecular weight distribution due to depolymerization effect during steam explosion and formaldehyde was mainly incorporated into the aromatic C- 5 position of G unit in the methylolation process. Overall, the study indicates that steam explosion is an effective treatment to improve the purity of lignin liquor and the direct substitution of phenolic adhesive by methylolated lignin liquor significantly reduces the costs for lignin recovery, which offers a promising approach for enhancing the commercial operation of a steam-explosion-derived biorefinery.

40|$|Costs of {{parasitism}} {{are commonly}} measured {{by comparing the}} performance of infected groups of individuals to that of uninfected control groups. This measure potentially underestimates the cost of parasitism because it ignores indirect costs, which may result from the modification of the competitiveness of the hosts by the parasite. In this context, we used the host-parasite system consisting of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti and the microsporidian parasite Vavraia culicis to address this question: Do infected individuals exert {{a more or less}} intense intraspecific competition than uninfected individuals? Our experimental results show that, indeed, infected hosts incur a direct cost of parasitism: It takes them longer to become adults than uninfected individuals. They also incur an indirect cost, however, which is actually larger than the direct cost: When grown in competition with uninfected individuals they develop even slower. The consequence of this modification of competitiveness is that, in our system, the cost of parasitism is underestimated by the traditional measure. Moreover, because the indirect cost depends on the frequency of interactions between infected and uninfected individuals, our results suggest that the real cost of parasitism, i. e., virulence, is negatively correlated with the prevalence of the parasite. This link between prevalence and virulence may have dynamical consequences, such as reducing the invasion threshold of the parasite, and evolutionary consequences, such as creating a selection <b>pressure</b> <b>maintaining</b> the host’s constitutive resistance to the parasite...|$|E

Biofuel production in thermophilic conditions is also considered more sustainable and the extreme condition provides high selection <b>pressure</b> <b>maintaining</b> the process continuity in an essentially non-aseptic environment saving cost of sterilization. This review highlights the potential of LCB in terms of its constituents which can be mobilized for ethanol and hydrogen fermentations with special note on the development of non-aseptic processes. These processes have been introduced in scenario of saving of energy inputs incurred on sterilization. While elevated fermentation temperature has an advantage of ethanol recovery simultaneously solving the problem of ethanol tolerance of microbes involved. Likewise at thermophilic condition higher H 2 yield has been documented due to limited growth of hydrogen consuming contaminants and faster metabolic activities of the producers. Pakistan has prolonged warm summer season and thus microbes thriving in extreme conditions of temperature are available naturally. The exploitation of locally available high temperature and solar energy for lignocellulosic biofuel production should be the focus of our future research work for development of cost-competitive and ecofriendly biofuels’ generation processes. These renewable bioenergy fuels would not only be a constant sustainable resource but will also pose less environmental risks compared to the conventional non-renewable fossil fuels’ usage.|$|E
