25|$|Docetaxel is a {{white powder}} and is the active {{ingredient}} available in 20mg and 80mg Taxotere single-dose vials of concentrated anhydrous docetaxel in <b>polysorbate</b> 80. The solution is a clear brown-yellow containing 40mg docetaxel and 1040mg <b>polysorbate</b> 80 per mL. 20mg Taxotere is distributed in a blister carton containing one single-dose vial of Taxotere (docetaxel) preparation in 0.5 mL sterile pyrogen-free anhydrous <b>polysorbate</b> 80, and a single dose Taxotere solvent vial containing 1.5 mL 13% ethanol in saline to be combined and diluted in a 250 mL infusion bag containing 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% glucose for administration. 80mg Taxotere is supplied identically but with 2.0 mL <b>polysorbate</b> 80 and 6.0 mL 13% ethanol in saline. The docetaxel and solvent vials are combined to give a solution of 10mg/mL and the required dose is drawn from this solution. Vials have an overfill to compensate for liquid loss during preparation, foaming, adhesion to vial walls and the dead volume. 20mg vials may be stored for 24 months below 25°C away from light and 80mg vials for 26 months in the same conditions.|$|E

25|$|Docetaxel {{was shown}} to be greater than 98% plasma protein bound {{independent}} of concentration at 37°C and pH 7.4 Docetaxel's plasma protein binding includes lipoproteins, alpha1 acid glycoprotein and albumin. Alpha1 acid glycoprotein is the most variable of these proteins inter-individually, especially in cancer patients and is therefore the main determinant of docetaxel's plasma binding variability. Docetaxel interacted little with erythrocytes and was unaffected by the <b>polysorbate</b> 80 in its storage medium. <b>Polysorbate</b> 80 may {{be the cause of}} hypersensitivity reasons in taxanes as recent studies indicated.|$|E

40|$|Size-exclusion {{chromatography}} (SEC) is {{a useful}} method for quantification of protein aggregates because of its high throughput capacity and highly quantitative performance. One {{of the problems in}} this method concerns <b>polysorbates,</b> which are well-known additives for protein-containing products to prevent protein aggregation, but frequently interfere with the photometric detection of protein aggregates. We developed a new SEC method that can separate <b>polysorbates</b> from protein sample solutions in an on-line mode with a precolumn with size exclusion and reversed-phase mixed modes. The precolumn can effectively trap <b>polysorbates</b> in aqueous mobile phase, and the trapped <b>polysorbates</b> are easily eluted with acetonitrile-containing aqueous mobile phase to clean the precolumn. Small parts of protein aggregates may be also trapped on the precolumn depending on temperature and proteins. Setting appropriate column temperature can minimize such inconvenient trapping of aggregates...|$|R
40|$|Não informadoThe acute edemagenic {{effect of}} four <b>polysorbates</b> (20, 40, 60, and 80) was studied in Wistar rats, after {{subcutaneous}} injections in {{the sole of}} the hindlimbs. These substances induced a similar pattern of paw edema, that was throughly followed by pletismographic measurements during 7 hours, and eventually 48 hours. At the standardized experimental conditions, the highest used concentrations of the <b>polysorbates</b> induce about 600 to 900 microlitres of increased paw volume, the maximum being collected after approximately 90 minutes, although about 70 % of this could be already recorded 30 minutes from the injections. The edemas are strongly inhibited by dexametasone and by the ?H IND. 1 ?-histamine receptor antagonist terfenadine, but are little or not sensitive to inhibition by the nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agents indomethacin or aspirin. The <b>polysorbates</b> exhibit the phenomenon of counter irritation, that is; {{a high degree of}} inhibition of the edema volume can be observed when one of these substances is simultaneously injected in both hindpaws of the same animal. No quantitative correlation could be found out between the edemagenic responses to the <b>polysorbates</b> and the viscosity or the tensoactivity of the injected solution...|$|R

25|$|The {{reactivity}} that {{is responsible}} for many of ethylene oxide's hazards also make it useful. Although too dangerous for direct household use and generally unfamiliar to consumers, ethylene oxide is used for making many consumer products as well as non-consumer chemicals and intermediates. These products include detergents, thickeners, solvents, plastics, and various organic chemicals such as ethylene glycol, ethanolamines, simple and complex glycols, polyglycol ethers, and other compounds. Although it is a vital raw material with diverse applications, including the manufacture of products like <b>polysorbate</b> 20 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) that are often more effective and less toxic than alternative materials, ethylene oxide itself is a very hazardous substance. At room temperature it is a flammable, carcinogenic, mutagenic, irritating, and anaesthetic gas.|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} amount of {{research in this area}} has been spent exploring methods of nanoparticle-mediated delivery of antineoplastic drugs to tumors in the central nervous system. For example, radiolabeled polyethylene glycol coated hexadecylcyanoacrylate nanospheres targeted and accumulated in a rat gliosarcoma. However, this method is not yet ready for clinical trials, due to the accumulation of the nanospheres in surrounding healthy tissue. Another, more promising approach, is the coating of polyalkylcyanoacrylate or poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles with <b>polysorbate</b> 80 or poloxamer 188. [...] Due to this coating the particles [...] adsorb apolipoproteins E or A-1 from the blood and [...] thus interact with the LRP1 or with the scavenger receptor followed by transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier into the brain. These particles loaded with doxorubicin for the treatment of glioblastomas are presently in Clinical Phase I. Recently, a novel class of multifunctional nanoparticles known as magneto-electric nanoparticles (MENs) has been discovered for externally controlled targeted delivery and release of drug(s) across BBB as well as wireless stimulation of cells deep in the brain. This approach depends more on the field control and less on the cellular microenvironment. In vitro and in vivo (on mice) experiments to prove the feasibility of using MENs to release a drug across BBB on demand and wirelessly stimulate the brain have been conducted by the research group of Prof. Sakhrat Khizroev at Florida International University (FIU).|$|E

40|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} are major vehicles for transmission of food-borne enteric viruses since they are easily contaminated at pre- and postharvest stages and they undergo little or no processing. However, commonly used sanitizers are relatively ineffective for removing human norovirus surrogates from fresh produce. In this study, we systematically evaluated the effectiveness of surfactants on removal of a human norovirus surrogate, murine norovirus 1 (MNV- 1), from fresh produce. We showed that a panel of surfactants, including sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Nonidet P- 40 (NP- 40), Triton X- 100, and <b>polysorbates,</b> significantly enhanced the removal of viruses from fresh fruits {{and vegetables}}. While tap water alone and chlorine solution (200 ppm) gave only < 1. 2 -log reductions in virus titer in all fresh produce, a solution containing 50 ppm of surfactant was able to achieve a 3 -log reduction in virus titer in strawberries and an approximately 2 -log reduction in virus titer in lettuce, cabbage, and raspberries. Moreover, a reduction of approximately 3 logs was observed in all the tested fresh produce after sanitization with a solution containing a combination of 50 ppm of each surfactant and 200 ppm of chlorine. Taken together, our results demonstrate {{that the combination of}} a surfactant with a commonly used sanitizer enhanced the efficiency in removing viruses from fresh produce by approximately 100 times. Since SDS is an FDA-approved food additive and <b>polysorbates</b> are recognized by the FDA as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) products, implementation of this novel sanitization strategy would be a feasible approach for efficient reduction of the virus load in fresh produce...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{surfactants}} are capable of interacting with phospholipid vesicles leading to different aggregated structures and finally to mixed micellar systems. By means of diffusion experiments with Valia-Chien cells the effect of different vesicular structures (MLV and SUV) and that of three <b>polysorbates</b> on the release of a model drug (caffeine) from various vesicle formulations was studied. Obtained results indicate that a remarkable delayed/sustained caffeine release is obtained only with the MLV preparations and that the presence of increasing surfactant concentrations initially leads to a further decrease of drug delivery rate and then to a faster release that reaches a maximum when only mixed micelles are present. The variation of the observed effects with the different tested surfactants, in relation to their lipophilicity (HLB values), is also discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S. A.

This study provides an initial assessment of the in vitro oesophageal retention characteristics of several widely utilised pharmaceutical coating materials. To this end, a previously described apparatus has been used to measure the force required to pull a coated disc-shaped model tablet across a section of excised oesophageal tissue. Of the materials tested, the well-studied mucoadhesive polymer sodium alginate was found to be associated with significant oesophageal adhesion properties that was capable of &# 039;self-repairing&# 039;.

40|$|Purpose. This study {{examines}} the microstructure, gelation tempera-tures, and flow properties of novel amphiphilogels consisting solely of non-ionic surfactants. Methods. Gels were prepared by mixing the solid gelator (sorbitan monostearate or sorbitan monopalmitate) and the liquid phase (liq-uid sorbitan esters or <b>polysorbates)</b> and heating them at 60 °C {{to form a}} clear isotropic sol phase, and cooling the sol phase to form an opaque semisolid at room temperature. Gel microstructure was ex-amined by light and electron microscopy and by small angle neutron scattering (SANS); gelation temperatures were measured by hot-stage microscopy, a melting point apparatus, and high sensitivity dif-ferential scanning calorimetry (HSDSC). Flow rheograms were per-formed to establish the zero-rate viscosity of the gels and their per-formance under shear. Results. Gel microstructures consisted mainly of clusters of tubules of gelator molecules that had aggregated upon cooling of the sol phase, forming a 3 D network throughout the continuous phase. The gels demonstrated thermoreversibility. Gelation temperature and viscos-ity increased with increasing gelator concentration, indicating a more robust gel network. At temperatures near the skin surface tempera-ture, the gels softened considerably; this would allow topical appli-cation. Conclusions. This study has demonstrated the formation/preparation of stable, thermoreversible, thixtropic surfactant gels (amphiphilo-gels) with suitable physical properties for topical use.
