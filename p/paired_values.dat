40|$|Abstract. Bilinear pairings {{derived from}} supersingular {{elliptic}} curves of embedding degrees 4 and 6 over finite fields F 2 m and F 3 m, respectively, {{have been used}} to implement pairing-based cryptographic protocols. The <b>pairing</b> <b>values</b> lie in certain prime-order subgroups of the cyclotomic subgroups of orders 22 m + 1 and 32 m − 3 m + 1, respectively, of the multiplicative groups F ∗ 24 m and F ∗ 36 m. It was previously known how to compress the <b>pairing</b> <b>values</b> over characteristic two fields by a factor of 2, and the <b>pairing</b> <b>values</b> over characteristic three fields by a factor of 6. In this paper, we show how the <b>pairing</b> <b>values</b> over characteristic two fields can be compressed by a factor of 4. Moreover, we present and compare several algorithms for performing exponentiation in the prime-order subgroups using the compressed representations. In particular, in the case where the base is fixed, we expect to gain at least a 54 % speed up over the fastest previously known exponentiation algorithm that uses factor- 6 compressed representations. 1...|$|R

The present study, however, was conducted in patients that were more severely ill than cardiac surgery patients, reflected by a longer length of stay in the ICU stay (15 vs. 3  days) and hospital (20 vs. 8  days). Thus, these two studies included completely different patients, which could at least in part explain the differences.

We determined point and trend accuracy, and reliability of a microdialysis-based continuous blood glucose-monitoring device (EIRUS(®)) in critically ill patients. Prospective study involving patients with an expected intensive care unit stay of ≥ 48 h. Every 15 min, device readings were compared with blood glucose values measured in arterial blood during blocks of 8 h per day for a maximum of 3 days. The Clarke error grid, Bland-Altman plot, mean absolute relative difference and glucose prediction error analysis were used to express point accuracy and the rate error grid to express trend accuracy. Reliability testing included aspects of the device and the external sensor, and the special central venous catheter (CVC) with a semipermeable membrane for use with this device.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to develop prediction equations for fat-mass percentage in infants in India based on skinfold thickness, mid-arm circumference, and age. Skinfold thicknesses and mid-arm circumference of 46 apparently-healthy infants (27 girls and 19 boys), aged 6 – 24 months, from among the urban poor attending a well baby clinic of a hospital in Kolkata were measured. Their body-fat percentage was measured using the D 2 O dilution technique as the reference method. Equations for body-fat percentage were developed using a stepwise forward regression model using skinfold thicknesses, mid-arm circumference, and age as independent variables, and the body-fat percentage was derived by D 2 O dilution as the dependent variable. The new prediction equations are: body-fat percentage=- 69. 26 + 5. 76 ×B- 0. 33 ×T 2 + 5. 40 ×M+ 0. 01 ×A 2 for girls and body-fat percentage=- 8. 75 + 3. 73 ×B+ 2. 57 ×S for boys, where B=biceps skinfold thickness, T=triceps skinfold thickness, and S=suprailiac skinfold thickness all in mm, M=mid-arm circumference in cm, and A=age in month. Using the D 2 O dilution technique, the means (SD) of the calculated body-fat percentage were 17. 11 (7. 25) for girls and 16. 93 (6. 62) for boys and, using the new prediction equations, these were 17. 11 (6. 25) for girls and 16. 93 (6. 02) for boys. The mean of the differences of <b>paired</b> <b>values</b> in body-fat percentage was zero.
