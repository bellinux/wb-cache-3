Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 45). This report “Customer Satisfaction on Retail Banking of the Trust Bank Limited” is {{the picture of a}} very well reputed commercial Private Bank doing banking business in Bangladesh science 1999 and it is sponsored by the Army Welfare Trust (AWT), is first {{of its kind in the}} country. Retail banking which is something known as personal financing services is what most people think of as high street naming it concerns providing financial products and services, such as bank and saving accounts insurance and mortgages to individuals. Some banks also include their business banking wing in their retail banking division. The key objective behind completing this report was to analyze and measure the customer satisfaction level of the customer of the bank. Retail banking sector of TBL is divided into 3 parts deposit products, loan products and cards. Firstly retail banking of trust bank consists of their wide range of deposit products such as current savings account, fixed deposit account, trust money double scheme, smart saver scheme, Lakhopoti scheme and so on. Secondly retail loan which can be secured (home loan, car loan) or unsecured loan (personal loan, education loan). Thirdly, card division which offers 4 types of TBL cards such as debit card, credit card, prepaid card and <b>Proprietary</b> <b>Card.</b> However, the main focus behind working on the topic was also to find out whether the customers are getting what they actually want from the retail banking facilities provided by TBL or not. The Questionnaire method was used to analyze the collected and available data in this report. Thus the data used in this report were very important in regard to finding out the key facts in fulfilling the research objectives. The key findings from this report were the reasons behind willingness to continue with TBL, dissatisfaction regarding regular customer service and poor usage authorization regarding regular transactions. Some suggestive remarks were also provided keeping in mind the trends and operations process of TBL retail banking business along with its weak points and limitations. Every research has got some limitations regarding the scope of its study. This report was based on a specific division of the banking business of TBL. So the biggest limitation of this study was it could not provide the full scenario of the TBL banking trends and business and its customer satisfaction level as a whole. Zubayda NazneenB.

50|$|An ATM card is any payment card {{issued by}} a {{financial}} institution that enables a customer to access an automated teller machine (ATM) in order to perform transactions such as deposits, cash withdrawals, obtaining account information, etc. ATM cards are known {{by a variety of}} names such as bank card, MAC (money access card), client card, key card or cash card, among others. Most payment cards, such as debit and credit cards can also function as ATM cards, although ATM-only cards are also available. Charge and <b>proprietary</b> <b>cards</b> cannot be used as ATM cards. The use of a credit card to withdraw cash at an ATM is treated differently to a POS transaction, usually attracting interest charges from the date of the cash withdrawal. Interbank networks allow the use of ATM cards at ATMs of private operators and financial institutions other than those of the institution that issued the cards.|$|R

50|$|In a short time, other {{countries}} adopted the EFTPOS technology, but these systems too {{were limited to}} the national borders. Each country adopted various interbank co-operative models. In New Zealand, Bank of New Zealand started issuing EFTPOS debit cards in 1985 with the first merchant terminals being installed in petrol stations. In Australia, in 1984 Westpac {{was the first major}} Australian bank to implement an EFTPOS system, at BP petrol stations. The other major banks implemented EFTPOS systems during 1984, initially with petrol stations. The banks' existing debit and credit cards (but only allowed to access debit accounts) were used in the EFTPOS systems. In 1985, the banks started to link their EFTPOS systems to provide access for all customers across all EFTPOS devices. Cards issued by all banks could then be used at all EFTPOS terminals nationally, but debit cards issued in {{other countries}} could not. Prior to 1986, the Australian banks organized a widespread uniform credit card, called Bankcard, which had been in existence since 1974. There was a dispute between the banks whether Bankcard (or credit cards in general) should be permitted into the proposed EFTPOS system. At that time several banks were actively promoting MasterCard and Visa credit cards. Store <b>cards</b> and <b>proprietary</b> <b>cards</b> were shut out of the new system.|$|R
