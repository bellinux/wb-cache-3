5|$|Despite Reich's {{precarious}} mental health, {{his work}} on character {{and the idea of}} muscular armouring contributed to the development of what is now known as ego psychology, gave rise to body <b>psychotherapy,</b> and helped shape the Gestalt therapy of Fritz Perls, the bioenergetic analysis of Reich's student Alexander Lowen, and the primal therapy of Arthur Janov.|$|E
5|$|Emotion-oriented {{interventions}} include reminiscence therapy, validation therapy, supportive <b>psychotherapy,</b> sensory integration, {{also called}} snoezelen, and simulated presence therapy. A Cochrane review has {{found no evidence}} that this is effective. Supportive <b>psychotherapy</b> has received little or no formal scientific study, but some clinicians find it useful in helping mildly impaired people adjust to their illness. Reminiscence therapy (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times with the aid of photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past. Although there are few quality studies on the effectiveness of RT, it may be beneficial for cognition and mood. Simulated presence therapy (SPT) is based on attachment theories and involves playing a recording with voices of the closest relatives of the person with Alzheimer's disease. There is partial evidence indicating that SPT may reduce challenging behaviours.|$|E

5|$|To {{recover from}} her {{experience}} at Studley, Fortune began studying <b>psychotherapy.</b> Her initial interest {{was in the}} work of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, though she later moved on to that of Carl Jung. She studied psychology and psychoanalysis under John Flügel at the University of London, before gaining employment at a psychological clinic in London's Brunswick Square, which was likely run {{under the jurisdiction of the}} London School of Medicine for Women. Working as a counsellor from 1914 until 1916, most of those she dealt with were coming to terms with sexual urges that were considered taboo in British society. Through her affiliation with the Society for the Study of Orthopsychics, she gave a series of lectures that were later published in 1922 as The Machinery of the Mind. While working at the clinic, she developed her interest in esotericism by attending lunchtime lectures organised by the Theosophical Society and reading some of the organisation's literature. With her interest in occultism increasing, Fortune became increasingly dissatisfied with the effectiveness of <b>psychotherapy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Among whites, gender nonconformity {{appeared}} {{to be important in}} the development of homosexuality among masculine homosexual women, but not among homosexual women who were not masculine, while adolescent homosexual involvement was important for non-masculine homosexual women but not masculine homosexual women. Bisexual women {{appeared to}} be more influenced by involvement in homosexual genital activities in childhood than exclusively homosexual women, but unlike exclusively homosexual women, their homosexual preference did not appear related to inability to experience heterosexual arousal in childhood. Childhood gender nonconformity appeared more significant for exclusively homosexual women than for bisexual women, and more significant for women who had been in <b>psychotherapy</b> than for women who had not.|$|E

Using CCTV, Chari secretly records the interrogation and uses it {{as evidence of}} Ambi's condition during his trial. Ambi is sentenced to <b>psychotherapy</b> in a mental hospital and {{will be eligible for}} release when cured.|$|E

25|$|For over a millennium, {{throughout}} the world, Buddhist practices {{have been used}} for non-Buddhist ends. More recently, clinical psychologists, theorists and researchers have incorporated Buddhist practices in widespread formalized <b>psychotherapies.</b> Buddhist mindfulness practices have been explicitly incorporated into a variety of psychological treatments.

5|$|Richard Nixon: The Shaping of His Character was {{published}} in late 1981 and received reviews less enthusiastic than any of her earlier books. Writing in The New Republic, Godfrey Hodgson questioned both her psychoanalytic approach and her motives: “e {{are in danger of}} having the insights of <b>psychotherapy</b> used as a tool for character destruction, certainly for libel, potentially for revenge.” Sales of the book were disappointing, {{in part because of the}} reviews, in part because memoirs by Nixon associates such as Henry Kissinger, John Ehrlichman, and John Dean had recently flooded the market. Perhaps Brodie’s book was most influential in stimulating Oliver Stone to create his controversial 1995 movie Nixon.|$|E
5|$|Shattered Memories {{retains the}} premise of the {{original}} game—Harry Mason's quest to find his missing daughter in the fictitious American town of Silent Hill—but is set in a different fictional universe, has a different plot, and altered characters, alongside new ones. Five endings are available. Gameplay takes place in two parts: a framing, first-person <b>psychotherapy</b> session, and an over-the-shoulder perspective of Harry's journey through Silent Hill, which is periodically interrupted by the occurrence of a shift to an alternate dimension. Answers given to the psychological tests in the therapy session affect various gameplay elements in Harry's journey.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Tourette's and no {{medication}} that works universally for all individuals without significant adverse effects. Knowledge, education and understanding are uppermost in management plans for tic disorders. The management of the symptoms of Tourette's may include pharmacological, behavioral and psychological therapies. While pharmacological intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms, other treatments (such as supportive <b>psychotherapy</b> or cognitive behavioral therapy) may help to avoid or ameliorate depression and social isolation, and to improve family support. Educating a patient, family, and surrounding community (such as friends, school, and church) is a key treatment strategy, and may be all that is required in mild cases.|$|E

5|$|Counseling {{about sex}} and {{sexuality}} by medical professionals, psychologists, social workers, and nurses {{is a part of}} most SCI rehabilitation programs. Education is part of the follow-up treatment for people with SCI, as are <b>psychotherapy,</b> peer mentorship, and social activities; these are helpful for improving skills needed for socializing and relationships. Rather than addressing sexual dysfunction strictly as a physical problem, appropriate sexual rehabilitation care takes into account the individual as a whole, for example addressing issues with relationships and self-esteem. Sexual counseling includes teaching techniques to manage depression and stress, and to increase attention to preserved sensations during sexual activity. Education includes information about birth control or assistive devices such as those for positioning in sex, or advice and ideas for addressing problems such as incontinence and autonomic dysreflexia.|$|E
5|$|Fortune {{was born}} in Llandudno, North Wales, to a wealthy upper middle-class English family, {{although}} little is known of her early life. By her teenage years {{she was living in}} England's West Country, where she wrote two books of poetry. After time spent at a horticultural college she began studying psychology and psychoanalysis at the University of London before working as a counsellor in a <b>psychotherapy</b> clinic. During the First World War she joined the Women's Land Army and established a company selling soy milk products. She became interested in esotericism through the teachings of the Theosophical Society, before joining an occult lodge led by Theodore Moriarty and then the Alpha et Omega occult organisation.|$|E
5|$|While benzodiazepines {{may have}} {{short-term}} benefits for anxiety, sleep and agitation in some patients, long-term (i.e., greater than 2–4 weeks) use {{can result in}} a worsening of the very symptoms the medications are meant to treat. Potential explanations include exacerbating cognitive problems that are already common in anxiety disorders, causing or worsening depression and suicidality, disrupting sleep architecture by inhibiting deep stage sleep, withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms in between doses mimicking or exacerbating underlying anxiety or sleep disorders, inhibiting the benefits of <b>psychotherapy</b> by inhibiting memory consolidation and reducing fear extinction, and reducing coping with trauma/stress and increasing vulnerability to future stress. Anxiety, insomnia and irritability may be temporarily exacerbated during withdrawal, but psychiatric symptoms after discontinuation are usually less than even while taking benzodiazepines. Fortunately, for those with benzodiazepine-induced problems, functioning significantly improves within 1 year of discontinuation.|$|E
