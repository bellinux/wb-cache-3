This myth was propaganda used by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War to explain why their pilots had improved success during night air battles, but was actually used to disguise advances in radar technology and the use of red lights on instrument panels. Nevertheless, the consumption of carrots was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a Dig for Victory campaign. A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use carrots in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food. The British public during WWII generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000 ton surplus of carrots from the extra production.|$|E

Fresh fruits were harvested from the plantain orchard of the Crops Research Institute in Kumasi, Ghana. The standard Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) methods were used to determine the moisture, crude protein, ash, crude fibre, potassium, iron, calcium, carbohydrate, sodium and crude fat. Pulp colour was measured with a Chromatometer (Minolta). The data was subjected to student t-test analysis. The results showed that the nutritional composition of the hybrids were similar to the local landrace. The hybrids however had higher fat content (1. 94 %) for FHIA- 21 and (1. 66 %) for FHIA- 03 compared to triploid plantains. The hybrids were slightly soft due to the high moisture content. There was a significant difference (p> 0. 05) in the potassium content between FHIA- 03 and FHIA- 21 (1060 mg/ 100 g dry weight for FHIA- 21 and 1725 mg/ 100 g dry weight for FHIA- 03) compared to reported values. This could be due to the soil and agronomic practices. The pulp colours of the hybrids were orange for FHIA- 21 and white to creamy for FHIA- 03 showing the physiological maturity of the fruits.

The yield values have been stable over the three-year study period. In addition, the FHIA hybrid plants were relatively short.

40|$|The {{pigments}} {{profile of}} {{virgin olive oil}} {{is determined by the}} pigments initially present in the fruits and their derivatives formed during the extraction process. The presence of other carotenoids or chlorophyll pigments at levels other than that associated with the extraction process indicate that oil has been adulterated or the extraction process was incorrect. The yellow pigments in olive oil are carotenoids and the green pigments are chlorophyll pigments. The amount of carotenoids in oil depends on variety, maturation index, treating of olive fruits before extraction, extraction process, and oil treating. Carotenes as well as xantophylls were identified in virgin olive oils. Lutein is usually the predominating compound in the carotenoid fraction of pigments, followed by B-carotene. The rest of carotenoid fraction are minor xantophylls, such as 5, 6 -epoxides, 5, 8 -epoxides or furanoids, and xantophyll esters. Cis-isomeres are also formed during the extraction process. The vitamin activity of cis-isomeres is lower as the activity of trans-isomeres. Pigment profile of olive oil is a useful tool for variety classification and authenticity determination. Carotenoids can act as antioxidants or prooxidants. Their antioxidant/prooxidant activity depend on concentration, solvent, and free radicals structure, presence of other antioxidants, metals and oxygen. The antioxidant activity of carotenoids has not been satisfactory explained as yet. There are three possible mechanisms of carotenoids antioxidant activity.

Very little is known about the quali-quantitative profile of retinoids in bovine milk as well as in that of other ruminant species. Only one study, describes the HPLC-UV analysis of retinyl esters in cow, goat and human milk. The main analytical difficulties are related to the unavailability of standards, their cost and the complexity in development chromatographic separation; in fact, vitamin A vitamers are characterized by subtle differences in chemical structures so a highly efficient and selective chromatographic system is needed for achieving their resolution. A reliable analytical approach, based on high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), allowed us to establish the real occurrence and distribution of several retinoids in raw cow, sheep, goat and water buffalo milk samples. Direct liquid extraction with solvents was performed for isolating retinoids while alkaline hydrolysis enabled the total retinol determination; yields exceeding 68 % were obtained for all analytes. Chromatographic separation was carried out using two tandem systems of reversed-phase columns (C 18 /C 18 and C 18 /C 30) in order to achieve total separation of the vitamin A vitamers. The chromatograph was coupled on-line with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, and the MS detection was accomplished by means of positive atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), operating in the Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) mode. According to our results, and in the light of the FAO/WHO recommendations, the consumption of milk may supply a significant portion of the daily intake of vitamin A, proving to be an important food, especially for infants and children.

40|$|The sterol {{fraction}} of milk is of nutritional interest because {{high levels of}} cholesterol in plasma (modulated by the cholesterol ingested) are associated with an increasing risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition, some sterols (ergosterol and 7 -dehydrocholesterol) are <b>provitamins</b> (D 2 and D 3 respectively). At the same time, through {{the study of the}} {{sterol fraction}}, vegetable fats can be detected in milk and dairy products. Sterols are a minor fraction of total milk fat, the main sterol being cholesterol (3 mg/g fat, equivalent to 100 mg/l cows' milk). Small quantities of other sterols (7 -dehydrocholesterol, 22 -dehydrocholesterol, ergosterol, fucosterol, lanosterol, lathosterol, 24 -methylenecholesterol) and several phytosterols have been reported in cows' milk (Walstra & Jennes, 1984). International Dairy Federation (1992) states that in the sterol profile of genuine milk fat there may appear, in addition to the peak of 7 -dehydrocholesterol which ranges from 0 · 7 to 4 % of total sterols, < 1 % of minor sterols with retention times corresponding to phytosterols. Values for the cholesterol content of goats' milk vary considerably, from 211 mg/l (Pantulu et al. 1975) to 125 mg/l (Lu, 1993), partly owing to the use of different analysis techniques. Some of these values were obtained using non-specific colorimetric methods, which are inaccurate in the presence of cholesterol precursors or phytosterols (Clark et al. 1983; Haugh & Harzer, 1984). Some minor peaks have been assumed to be sterols but have not been identified (García-Olmedo & Barrera, 1985). Conventional methods of sample preparation for sterol analysis prior to gas chromatography (GC), which involve saponification of fat with or without isolation of the sterol fraction by thin layer chromatography, are tedious and time-consuming.
