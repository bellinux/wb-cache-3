50|$|Patents issued at {{the turn}} of the 20th century show that early {{researchers}} were envisioning ways of making flat conductors sandwiched between layers of insulating material to layout electrical circuits to serve in early telephony switching applications. One of the earliest descriptions of what could be called a flex circuit was unearthed by Dr Ken Gilleo and disclosed in an English patent by Albert Hansen in 1903 where Hansen described a construction consisting of flat metal conductors on <b>paraffin</b> coated <b>paper.</b> Thomas Edison’s lab books from the same period also indicate that he was thinking to coat patterns cellulose gum applied to linen paper with graphite powder to create what would have clearly been flexible circuits, though there is no evidence that it was reduced to practice.|$|R
40|$|A {{paraffin}} {{phase change}} emulsion is a multifunctional fluid consisting of water as the continuous phase and a paraffin as the dispersed phase. It can store or transfer {{large amounts of}} thermal energy by using the latent heat capacity of the paraffin during the solide-liquid transition {{as well as the}} sensible heat capacity of water and that of the <b>paraffin.</b> This <b>paper</b> presents three <b>paraffin</b> emulsions with different phase transition temperatures: CryoSol plus 6, CryoSol plus 10 and CryoSol plus 20. CryoSol plus 6 is foreseen for airconditioning applications with a freezing peak point of 6 °C, CryoSol plus 10 for cooling of buildings with a freezing peak point of 10 °C and CryoSol plus 20 for increasing the thermal storage mass of building components with a freezing peak point of 20 °C...|$|R
50|$|In 1906, trouble had {{constantly}} arisen {{due to the}} gum on {{the under}} face of the stamps.

50|$|In 1874 he {{established}} his own laboratory. He received his first patent, covering {{a process for}} utilizing tin scrap, in 1874. His second patent was on a process for purifying paraffin wax in 1876. Both of these became important to industry. Paraffin wax was formerly a waste by-product in oil refining, but with his invention, it became capable of utilization {{in the manufacture of}} candles and for other industrial purposes. He also developed <b>paraffin</b> <b>paper,</b> which had great and varied uses as a waterproof packing material for foodstuffs, confectionery, etc., and made possible the safe transportation and preservation of many substances, otherwise perishable. Other earlier inventions were connected with the production of oil, salt, and white lead.|$|E

Alternative materials which have been reported to have beneficial effect on seed production, include terylene (Foster, 1968) and Kraft paper bags (Wells, 1962; Smith and Mehlenbacher, 1994)). Others (Smith and Mehlenbacher, 1994;) have used paper bags and variation of spun polyethylene bags which are made from spun-bond polyethylene fibre sheet designed and marketed as a vapour barrier for residential building construction (Tyvek Home- wrap, DuPont Corp., Wilmington DE); fabric bags of polyester, cotton muslin and nylon fabrics (Neal and Anderson, 2004); and polyester micromesh fabric (Nel and J van Staden, 2013; Vogel et al., 2014).|$|E
40|$|Phase Change Slurry (PCS) is a {{multifunctional}} fluid {{consisting of}} a Phase Change Material (PCM) as dispersed phase and a carried fluid as continuous phase.

40|$|Results of {{computer}} simulations and measurements of frequency-dependent dielectric properties of a binary composite material are presented. The studied composite had well-defined 3 D periodic structure and {{was made of}} <b>paraffin</b> and <b>paper</b> laminate. In the considered frequency range (10 (- 3) 10 (3) Hz), both the constituents were characterized by significantly different dispersive properties of complex dielectric permittivities. These frequency-dependent parameters were measured and were used for 3 D numerical simulations of the effective dielectric properties of the mixture. The simulations were performed using two methods, the finite-volume method and the finite-element method. Frequency variations of the computed effective complex permittivity of the composite are discussed and are compared with the experimental data. The results of the simulations show that the distributions of the micro-scale electric field and dielectric losses in {{the volume of the}} composite material are strongly frequency dependent. This effect is also analyzed using classical models for composite dielectric structures...|$|R
5000|$|The {{practice}} of oiling parchment or paper {{in order to}} make it semi-translucent or moisture-proof goes back at least to the middle ages. Paper impregnated or coated with purified beeswax was widely used throughout the 19th century to retain or exclude moisture, or to wrap odorous products. Gustave Le Gray introduced the use of waxed paper for photographic negatives in 1851. [...] Natural wax was largely replaced for the making of wax paper (or paraffine paper) after Herman Frasch developed ways of purifying <b>paraffin</b> and coating <b>paper</b> with it in 1876. Wax paper is commonly used in cooking for its non-stick properties, and wrapping food for storage, such as cookies, as it keeps water out or in. It is also used in arts and crafts.|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} for {{the determination of}} n -alkanes migration from <b>paraffin</b> <b>paper</b> packaging into fatty foods has been fully developed. First, the lipid fraction of the cheddar cheese is extracted {{with a mixture of}} diethyl ether/ n -hexane (1 : 1). Then, a sulphuric acid-impregnated silica gel (SAISG) clean-up procedure is performed and the final extract is analysed by gas-chromatography (GC) with flame ionisation detector (FID). The procedure has been validated in terms of limits of detection and quantification, linear range, recovery, precision and robustness. The method has been used in the evaluation of the n -alkane migra- tion from paraffin coated paper into cheddar cheese. Results after 10 days of migration test showed the typical n -alkanes (C 19 –C 37) profile of migration with a maximum (21. 1 ± 10. 8 l gg 1) in n -pentacosane (C 25) ...|$|E
40|$|Paired cuts of beef, {{pork and}} lamb {{in the form}} of steaks or chops, ground meat and roasts, and {{corresponding}} portions of ham, bacon, sausage, dried beef and representative ready-to-serve meats (chicken loaf, boiled tongue, etc.) were stored for varying lengths of time, under a selected number of different storage conditions, in ice and mechanical refrigerators of the size commonly used in the home. Greatest loss in weight occurred when the meat was stored uncovered; least loss, when wrapped in <b>paraffin</b> <b>paper</b> or stored in a covered container. Fresh meat stored in a covered container showed signs of deterioration after 72 hours. Adding salt during the storage period gave fresh meat a moist consistency and prevented the formation of a surface crust but increased the tendency to become slimy. A moist atmosphere caused mold to form on cured meat; a dry atmosphere caused a deposit of the curing salts on the surface...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} was {{started at the}} same time of the experiment 3 with the same purpose and continued to fifth generations. In 1939, 34 samples of 7 rape varieties were recollected from the central and five local rape breeding centers where they settled during the past 10 years propagated by self pollinated seeds under <b>paraffin</b> <b>paper</b> bag or victoria lawn cage. Two to six individuals of each local strain representing earliest or latest flowering time were treated year after year. Throughout the progeny test such agronomic characteristics as date of flowering, plant height, number of first order branches, length of ear, size of seedling before transplanting, seed yield per plant, leaf color, waxiness and degree of anthocyan pigmentation were compared among local strains or intra-local lines. The same variation as found in wheat {{experiment was}} recognized in this case, that is, some varieties showed small variation among local strains or intra-local lines, however, others deviated greatly. Usually, early flowering type developed in the materials collected from southern regions, and late flowering line separated in the northern stations. From this experiment the author concluded that delivered rape varieties have been continuing to differentiate to new ecotypes reconstructing their genetic composition to adapt their new habitats. In conclusion, the author discussed the development of genecological studies in Japan and abroad or studies of varietal differentiation of main crop plant. Finally, he emphasized that in case of seed raising and propagation of crop plant variety, special attention should be given {{to the fact that the}} variety was not static but dynamic, usually has been reconstructing its genetic constitution and differentiating into new ecotype adapting to its new habitats. この実験は小麦に関する実験とほぼ同様な意図と企画のもとに,菜種の 7 品種を用いて 1937 年秋着手され, 5 ヵ年間にわたつて遂行されたものである...|$|E
5000|$|Prior to this, {{people used}} natural rye grass straws, which were {{undesirable}} because they imparted a grassy flavor in beverages. In response to this, Marvin C. Stone {{made the first}} drinking straw prototypes by spiraling a strip of paper around a pencil and gluing it at the ends. Next he experimented with <b>paraffin</b> wax-coated manila <b>paper,</b> {{so that it would}} not get soggy when used. This first model was 8 1/2 inches long and had a diameter just wide enough to prevent things like lemon seeds from getting lodged in the tube. Marvin Stone patented his invention on January 3, 1888.

40|$|The {{pictures}} of the serum protein extended by electropaperchromatography show varieties being greatly influenced by the distance of start line from the pole and the space surrounding the paper, even if other conditions, the electric strength, the time for extension, the pH of the buffer and others are kept in constant. The reason is the added effect of the liquid stream occurring on the paper to {{the movement of the}} charged protein molecules for the opposite pole. The liquid stream on the paper stretched horizontally is caused by the evaporation of water from the paper warmed by electric streaming. This can be diminished by filling the space with liquid paraffin. The {{pictures of}} the extended protein on the several papers arranged parallel between to poles show the different patterns from each others. This is caused by differences of the water content in each paper by which electric streaming varies. Serial arrangement of the papers between two poles gives always good results, yielding almost the same picture in each paper. From those observations the author designed and constructed a new apparatus for electropaperchromatography for serum protein. Using this apparatus (Fig. 3) filling the whole space with liquid <b>paraffin,</b> 4 <b>papers</b> gave always constant results which enabled the comparison of the components of serum and the other paraffin insoluble fractions...|$|R
40|$|XI Congreso de Ingeniería del Transporte (CIT 2014) This study {{presents}} the results of different laboratory tests related to the density, adhesion (sensitivity to water test) and rigidity (resilient module) of bituminous mixtures, manufactured at three different temperatures (160 °C, 140 °C and 120 °C), with three additives: a surfactant made up of different amino substances, a paraffin obtained by the Fisher-Tropsch synthesis process which is totally soluble in bitumen, and a synthetic zeolite in powder form which causes the bitumen to micro-foam,. Test samples have been compacted by impact, according to the Marshall method, and kneading, according to gyratory machine. To evaluate these properties an asphalt concrete mixture has been chosen, with a binder, B- 50 / 70, and a maximum size of aggregates of 16 mm, which is usually placed in the surface layer of the pavement. The densities obtained by the two compaction methods are easy to reach. Densities will decrease if the temperature of manufacturing is lower. All mixtures compacted by gyratory machine at different temperatures displayed very good behavior of water sensitivity; but not all mixtures compacted by impact achieved this. The additives improve the adhesion between aggregate and binder. The stiffness moduli decreased in all mixtures for both types of compaction when the temperature was higher, and this reduction is less pronounced in the mixes manufactured with the gyratory compactor. Mixtures with additives tend to reduce the module, except <b>paraffin.</b> This <b>paper</b> is based on the results for the Fenix Project.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the direct {{transfer}} via lamination of chemical vapor deposition graphene onto different flexible substrates. The transfer method investigated here is fast, simple, and does not require an intermediate transfer membrane, such as polymethylmethacrylate, which needs to be removed afterward. Various substrates of general interest in research and industry were studied in this work, including polytetrafluoroethylene filter membranes, PVC, cellulose nitrate/cellulose acetate filter membranes, polycarbonate, <b>paraffin,</b> polyethylene terephthalate, <b>paper,</b> and cloth. By comparing the properties of these substrates, two critical factors {{to ensure a successful}} transfer on bare substrates were identified: the substrate’s hydrophobicity and good contact between the substrate and graphene. For substrates that do not satisfy those requirements, polymethylmethacrylate {{can be used as a}} surface modifier or glue to ensure successful transfer. Our results can be applied to facilitate current processes and open up directions for applications of chemical vapor deposition graphene on flexible substrates. A broad range of applications can be envisioned, including fabrication of graphene devices for opto/organic electronics, graphene membranes for gas/liquid separation, and ubiquitous electronics with graphene.

5000|$|Walker’s early {{installations}} combined botanical illustrations with industrial machinery. Utilizing diverse materials (such as: steel, copper, <b>paraffin,</b> watercolour on <b>paper,</b> book, pressed plant, glass, oak, Carrara marble, Belgian black marble, oak, beeswax and more...) Walker analyzed sculptural ciphers across knowledge domains. The theorist Daina Augaitis wrote (in an 1991 essay {{published by}} the Banff Centre for the Arts entitled ‘Seeing nature: and the works of Bill Viola and Laurie Walker’): “Each of these works draws on layers of reference which entwine historically constructed notions of knowledge, authority and beauty with contemporary understandings of natural environments.”In the first decade after her graduation from university (1987-), Walker's signature style paid rigorous attention to materials. She explored personal identity transformed through a synthesis of ancient mythological references, industrial tools, taxidermy, botanical illustrations and biological organisms (bioluminescent bacteria, pigs bladders, etc...). In 1994, this culminated in a solo show: “Laurie Walker - Seeing Blue” at the Musee d’art contemporain de Montreal, Montreal, QC. The curator of ‘Seeing Blue’, Pierre Landry described how: “The strange seductive power of these works stems as much from the mastery they show {{in their use of}} techniques and material, both varied (wood, copper, marble, watercolor) and sometimes, uncommon (peat moss, bioluminescent bacteria…) as from the symbolic information…” In 1994, the critic John Armstrong reiterated these assessments in a review of Walker’s work: “The natural, here as in her other works, is committed to representation's own symbiotic narratives.” ...|$|R
40|$|The layer-by-layer (LbL) {{technique}} {{was used to}} modify the surface of cellulose fibers by consecutive adsorption of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) followed by a final adsorbed layer of anionic <b>paraffin</b> wax colloids. <b>Paper</b> hand sheets made from the modified fibers {{were found to be}} highly hydrophobic with a contact angle of 150 °. In addition to the significantly increased hydrophobicity, the sheets showed improved mechanical properties, such as a higher tensile strength. Heat treatment of the prepared sheets further enhanced both the mechanical properties and the hydrophobicity. These results demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the LbL technique, which allows us to combine the known adhesive effect of PAH/PAA LbL films with the functionality of wax nanoparticles, creating a stronger and highly hydrophobic paper. It was further observed that LbL modified sheets without wax also displayed increased hydrophobicity when heat treated. The mechanism was studied through model experiments where LbL films of PAH/PAA were assembled on flat non-porous model cellulose surfaces. Contact angle measurements showed the same trend due to heat treatment of the model films, although, the absolute value of the contact angles were smaller. Analysis using the highly interfacial sensitive vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy technique showed an enrichment of CH 3 groups (from the polymer chain ends) at the solid/air interface. These results indicate that during the heat treatment, a reorientation of polymer chains occurs to minimize the surface energy of the LbL film. In the second part of this work, the adhesive interactions between the main constituents of wood fibers were studied using high-resolution measuring techniques and well-defined model films of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Successful surface modification of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) caps, needed in the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) measuring methodology, by LbL deposition of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) and poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) allowed for the first known all-wood biopolymer JKR measurements of the adhesion between cellulose/cellulose, cellulose/lignin and the cellulose/glucomannan surfaces. The work of adhesion on loading and the adhesion hysteresis were similar for all three systems, suggesting that adhesion between the different wood biopolymers does not differ greatly.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two separate parts. The first part {{consists of}} one paper and considers problems concerning spatial point processes {{and the second part}} includes three papers in the field of bioinformatics. The first part of the thesis is based on a forestry problem of estimating the number of trees in a region by using the information in an aerial photo, showing the area covered by the trees. The positions of the trees are assumed to follow either a binomial point process or a hard-core Strauss process. Furthermore, discs of equal size are used to represent the tree-crowns. We provide formulas for the expectation and the variance of the relative vacancy for both processes. The formulas are approximate for the hard-core Strauss process. Simulations indicate that the approximations are accurate.   The second part of this thesis focuses on pre-processing of microarray data. The microarray technology can be used to measure the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously in a single experiment. The technique is used to identify genes that are differentially expressed between two populations, e. g. diseased versus healthy individuals. This information can be used in several different ways, for example as diagnostic tools and in drug discovery. The microarray technique involves a number of complex experimental steps, where each step introduces variability in the data. Pre-processing aims to reduce this variation and is a crucial part of the data analysis. Paper II gives a review over several pre-processing methods. Spike-in data are used to describe how the different methods affect the sensitivity and bias of the experi­ment. An important step in pre-processing is dye-normalization. This normalization aims to re­move the systematic differences due to the use of different dyes for coloring the samples. In Paper III a novel dye-normalization, the MC-normalization, is proposed. The idea behind this normaliza­tion is to let the channels’ individual intensities determine the cor­rection, rather than the aver­age intensity which is the case for the commonly used MA-normali­zation. Spike-in data showed that  the MC-normalization reduced the bias for the differentially expressed genes compared to the MA-normalization. The standard method for preserving patient samples for diagnostic purposes is fixation in formalin followed by embedding in <b>paraffin</b> (FFPE). In <b>Paper</b> IV we used tongue-cancer micro­RNA-microarray data to study the effect of FFPE-storage. We suggest that the microRNAs are not equally affected by the storage time and propose a novel procedure to remove this bias. The procedure improves the ability of the analysis to detect differentially expressed microRNAs...|$|R
