40|$|In {{order to}} address the lack of {{reliable}} indicators of corruption, this article develops a composite indicator of high-level institutionalised corruption through a novel ‘Big Data’ approach. Using publicly available electronic public <b>procurement</b> <b>records</b> in Hungary, we identify “red flags” in the public procurement process and link them to restricted competition and recurrent contract award to the same company. We use this method to create a corruption indicator at contract level that can be aggregated {{to the level of}} individual organizations, sectors, regions and countries. Because electronic public procurement data is available in virtually all developed countries from about the mid- 2000 s, this method can generate a corruption index based on objective data that is consistent over time and across countries. We demonstrate the validity of the corruption risk index by showing that firms with higher corruption risk score had relatively higher profitability, higher ratio of contract value to initial estimated price, greater likelihood of politicians managing or owning them, and greater likelihood of registration in tax havens, than firms with lower scores on the index. In the conclusion we discuss the uses of this data for academic research, investigative journalists, civil society groups, and small and medium business. This is the author accepted manuscript.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate plasma lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity in multiple organ donors as a predictor of liver allograft viability prior to OLTx. Thirty-nine donors were studied during a 5 -month period between April and August 1988. Allograft hepatectomy was performed using a rapid technique or its minor modification with hilar dissections, and the allografts were stored cold (4 degrees C) in University of Wisconsin (UW) solution. Early post-transplant allograft function was classified as good, fair, or poor, according to the highest SGOT, SGPT, and prothrombin time within 5 days following OLTx. <b>Procurement</b> <b>records</b> were reviewed to identify donor data, which included conventional liver function tests, duration of hospital stay, history of cardiac arrest, and graft ischemic time. Blood samples from the donors were drawn immediately prior to aortic crossclamp, and from these plasma LCAT activity was determined. Plasma LCAT activity of all donors was significantly lower than that of healthy controls (12. 4 +/- 8. 0 vs 39. 2 +/- 13. 3 micrograms/ml per hour, P less than 0. 01). LCAT activity (16. 4 +/- 8. 3 micrograms/ml per hour) in donors of grafts with good function was significantly higher than that in those with fair (8. 6 +/- 4. 5 micrograms/ml per hour, P less than 0. 01) or poor (7. 3 +/- 2. 4 micrograms/ml per hour, P less than 0. 01) function.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. The {{business}} environment of today {{has become more}} dynamic and unpredictable, where managers {{are being asked to}} cut costs while maintaining or even increasing the service quality in a very short period. If management wants accurate costs of services, a more sophisticated understanding of activities and their cost drivers is required due to the high proportion of overhead costs. Overhead costs are inevitable especially in a predominantly service–oriented organisation. In this modern age, ABC appears to be the contemporary costing system that could provide possible solutions in dealing with these escalating overhead costs. The primary objective of this analysis was to develop and implement an activity–based costing model for the South African Pharmacy Council. The secondary objectives of this analysis were to investigate the optimal costing and pricing of the services produced; provide a service–costing framework through an ABC system; analyse the service and customer profitability; and to make recommendations about potential overhead costs reduction points within the department {{based on the results of}} the ABC analysis. Data required to conduct the analysis was obtained from the organisation’s Quality Management System, dashboard processes document, financial records and the <b>procurement</b> <b>records.</b> The minimum amount of times required to complete activities were estimated based on the experience, direct observation, and informal interviewing of the personnel involved with the activity. The internship programme consumed the most financial resources (70. 6 %) allocated to the department. Negative contribution margins were experienced with respect to the provision of the internship programme. The activities associated with portfolio assessment and the conducting of internship workshops are consuming a considerable amount of resources allocated to the provision of the internship. These activities are the major cost drivers in the provision of the internship programme. Master...|$|E

Logistics is one essential administration {{that should be}} made by an organization. The logistic procedures consist of <b>procurement,</b> <b>recording,</b> storage, distribution, maintenance, and elimination. At present, the logistic activities at economics faculty are running quite well. However, based on the studies conducted by many researchers, the logistic impacts require further examination and analysis. The pre-research study based on interviews shows that no logistic staff handles the logistic management. For the time being, the logistic activities are handled by the public utility staffs. Besides, the Standardized Operational Procedures on logistic management are still unclear. This research uses a descriptive-qualitative approach. Data are obtained from informants in the forms of words, measures, and writings. Interview, observation, and documental analysis are techniques used to collect the data. Samples are taken with a purposive sampling technique and then data are analyzed using an interactive technique. Data validation is conducted using triangulation techniques and methodologies. The research {{results show that the}} logistic activities are not yet ideally running, such as poor conditioned inventory management of goods, uncontrolled stock opname; not maximally utilized forms as the controlling devices; limited warehouses for supply storage; unavailable warehouses for storage of the upcoming goods to eliminate, unscheduled goods inventory maintenance, and too long waiting period of elimination activities...|$|R
