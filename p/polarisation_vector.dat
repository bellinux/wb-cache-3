40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{multiscale}} method {{to calculate the}} amplitude of the gradient of the linear <b>polarisation</b> <b>vector</b> using a wavelet-based formalism. We demonstrate this method using a field of the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS) and show that the filamentary structure typically seen in gradients of linear polarisation maps depends strongly on the instrumental resolution. Our analysis reveals that different networks of filaments are present on different angular scales. The wavelet formalism allows us to calculate the power spectrum of the fluctuations seen in gradients of linear polarisation maps and to determine the scaling behaviour of this quantity. The power spectrum is found to follow a power law with gamma ~ 2. 1. We identify a small drop in power between scales of 80 < l < 300 arcmin, which corresponds well to the overlap in the u-v plane between the Effelsberg 100 -m telescope and the DRAO 26 -m telescope data. We suggest that this drop is due to undersampling present in the 26 -m telescope data. In addition, the wavelet coefficient distributions show higher skewness on smaller scales than at larger scales. The spatial distribution of the outliers in the tails of these distributions creates a coherent subset of filaments correlated across multiple scales, which trace the sharpest changes in the <b>polarisation</b> <b>vector</b> P within the field.

Therefore, they provide observa-tional constraints on the different models proposed for the pulsar emission mechanisms. Optical polarisation data of the Vela pulsar {{was obtained from the}} Hubble Space Tele-scope (HST) archive. The data, obtained in two filters (F 606 W; central wavelength = 590. 70 nm, and F 550 M; central wavelength = 558. 15 nm), consists of a series of observations of the pulsar taken with the HST/Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and covers a time span of 5 days. This data have been used to carry out the first high-spatial resolution and multi-epoch study of the polarisation of the pulsar. We produced <b>polarisation</b> <b>vector</b> maps of the region surrounding the pulsar and measured the degree of linear polarisation (P. D.) and the position angle (P.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyThe thesis systematically investigates the laser interference nanomanufacturing technology taking into account its advantages and abilities to realise various potential applications. The latest progresses have addressed the major issues hampering the cross-scale developments of structural applications, such as cost-ineffective fabrication, limited area, low efficiency and challenging integration. The studies carried out on high-resolution and large-area laser interference nanomanufacturing technology will complement the exploration of modern optical devices and extraordinary functional applications. With respect to classical interference theory and relevant references, {{there is still a}} lack of studies providing insight into the effects of polarisation on the multi-beam interference while it is found that the <b>polarisation</b> <b>vector</b> {{plays a key role in}} the formation, period and contrast of interfering patterns. Herein, the theory of multi-beam interference is developed through the integration of the <b>polarisation</b> <b>vector</b> and electric field vector. It is worth pointing out that based on the detailed analysis of the four-beam interference with the special polarisation modes, it is demonstrated that the modulation phenomenon in four-beam laser interference is the result of the misalignment of incident angles or unequal incident angles only in the case of the TE-TE-TM-TM mode. In the experiments, a straightforward method of generating various well-defined structures on material surfaces is proposed using the nanosecond laser interference system. The experimental results of two-, three- and four-beam interference show a good correspondence to the theoretical analyses and simulations. Artificial bio-structures are fabricated using the four-beam interference method with the TE-TE-TE-TE polarisation mode and the fabricated microcone structures exhibit excellent properties with both a high contact angle (CA= 156. 3 °) and low omnidirectional reflectance (5. 9 - 15. 4...|$|E
40|$|Fermi Transport {{is useful}} for {{describing}} the behaviour of spins or gyroscopes following nongeodesic, timelike world lines. However, Fermi Transport breaks down for null world lines.
