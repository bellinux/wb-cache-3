5|$|W3 {{is found}} in Arabian horses descended from R Khasper, a near-white {{stallion}} born in 1996. Neither of his parents were white, and the causative mutation (c.706A>T) {{is thought to have}} originated with this horse. It is a nonsense mutation on Exon4. Horses with the W3 allele often retain interspersed flecks or regions of <b>pigmented</b> <b>skin</b> and hair, which may fade with time. Some members of this family possess blue eyes, but these are thought to be inherited separately from the white coat. Based on similar studies in mice, researchers have named W3 as potentially homozygous nonviable.|$|E
25|$|Although darkly <b>pigmented</b> <b>skin</b> absorbs about 30 to 40% more {{sunlight}} than lightly <b>pigmented</b> <b>skin,</b> {{dark skin}} does not increase the body's internal heat intake in conditions of intense solar radiation. Solar radiation heats up rather the body's surface {{and not the}} interior. Furthermore, this amount of heat is negligible compared the heat produced when muscles are actively used during exercise. Regardless of skin colour, humans have excellent capabilities to dissipate heat through sweating. Half of the solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface {{is in the form}} of infrared light and is absorbed similarly regardless of skin coloration.|$|E
25|$|Dark skin offers great {{protection}} against UVR {{because of its}} eumelanin content, the UVR-absorbing capabilities of large melanosomes, and because eumelanin can be mobilized faster and brought {{to the surface of}} the skin from the depths of the epidermis. For the same body region, light- and dark-skinned individuals have similar numbers of melanocytes (there is considerable variation between different body regions), but pigment-containing organelles, called melanosomes, are larger and more numerous in dark-skinned individuals. Keratocytes from dark skin cocultured with melanocytes give rise to a melanosome distribution pattern characteristic of dark skin. Melanosomes are not in aggregated state in darkly <b>pigmented</b> <b>skin</b> compared to lightly <b>pigmented</b> <b>skin.</b> Due to the heavily melanised melanosomes in darkly <b>pigmented</b> <b>skin,</b> it can absorb more energy from UVR and thus offers better {{protection against}} sunburns and by absorption and dispersion UV rays. Darkly <b>pigmented</b> <b>skin</b> protects against direct and indirect DNA damage. Photodegration occurs when melanin absorbs photons. Recent research suggest that the photoprotective effect of dark skin is increased by the fact that melanin can capture free radicals, such as hydrogen peroxide, which are created by the interaction of UVR and layers of the skin. Heavily pigmented melanocytes have greater capacity to divide after UVR irradiation, which suggests that they receive less damage to their DNA. Despite this, UVB damages the immune system even in darker skinned individuals due to its effect on Langerhans cells. The stratum corneum of people with dark or heavily tanned skin is more condensed and contains more cornified cell layers than in lightly pigmented humans. These qualities of dark skin enhance the barrier protection function of the skin.|$|E
5000|$|The rosé {{style of}} Montepulciano d'Abruzzo is labeled as Cerasuolo which means [...] "cherry-red" [...] and {{relates to the}} deep color the wine gets even with very brief skin-contact with the highly <b>pigmented</b> <b>skins</b> of the Montepulciano grape. According to Bastianich, Cerasuolo's tend to be medium-body and rather hearty for an Italian rosé with aromas of orange peel, cinnamon, {{strawberry}} and dried cherries.|$|R
25|$|In the Valle d'Aosta DOC, locals {{refer to}} the {{indigenous}} grape Premetta as a rosato naturale due to the extremely thin and lightly <b>pigmented</b> <b>skins</b> of the variety that even with extended maceration can only produce a very pale rosé wine. According to wine experts Joe Bastianich and David Lynch, Valle d'Aosta Premetta rosés are very fruity with strawberry aromas and spicy cinnamon notes.|$|R

25|$|Freckles {{usually only}} occur {{in people with}} very lightly <b>pigmented</b> <b>skin.</b> They vary from very dark to brown in colour and develop a random pattern on {{the skin of the}} individual. Solar lentigines, the other types of freckles, occur among old people {{regardless}} of skin colour. People with very light skin (types I and II) make very little melanin in their melanocytes, and have very little or no ability to produce melanin in the stimulus of UV radiation. This can result in frequent sunburns and a more dangerous, but invisible, damage done to connective tissue and DNA underlying the skin. This can contribute to premature aging and skin cancer. The strongly red appearance of lightly <b>pigmented</b> <b>skin</b> as a response to high UV radiation levels is caused by the increased diameter, number, and blood flow of the capillaries.|$|E
25|$|Pearl-Cream pseudo-double dilute {{occurs when}} a horse has one cream gene and one pearl gene. These two {{distinct}} dilution factors interact to produce a cremello-like coat. Pearl-creams have pale but <b>pigmented</b> <b>skin</b> and blue-green eyes, and are distinctly pale cream-colored. To date, the Pearl gene {{has been found in}} Quarter Horses, Paint horses, and some Iberian horses. Pearl is not known to be associated with any health problems.|$|E
25|$|People with {{moderately}} <b>pigmented</b> <b>skin</b> (Types III-IV) {{are able}} to produce melanin in their skin in response to UVR. Normal tanning is usually delayed as it takes time for the melanins to move up in the epidermis. Heavy tanning does not approach the photoprotective effect against UVR-induced DNA damage compared to naturally occurring dark skin, however it offers great protection against seasonal variations in UVR. Gradually developed tan in the spring prevents sunburns in the summer. This mechanism is almost certainly the evolutionary reason behind the development of tanning behaviour.|$|E

First, the in vitro system was reconstructed with or without fibroblasts {{in order to test}} the global influence of the presence of this cell type.

25|$|Some {{types of}} {{albinism}} affect only {{the skin and}} hair, while other types affect the skin, hair and eyes, and in rare cases only the eyes. All of them are caused by different genetic mutations. Albinism is a recessively inherited trait in humans where both pigmented parents may be carriers of the gene and pass it down to their children. Each child has a 25% chance of being albino and a 75% chance of having normally <b>pigmented</b> <b>skin.</b> One common type of albinism is oculocutaneous albinism or OCA, which has many subtypes caused by different genetic mutations.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with lightly <b>pigmented</b> <b>skin</b> who are {{repeatedly}} {{exposed to}} strong UV radiation, experience faster {{aging of the}} skin, which shows in increased wrinkling and anomalies of pigmentation. Oxidative damage causes the degradation of protective tissue in the dermis, which confers {{the strength of the}} skin. It has been postulated that white women may develop wrinkles faster after menopause than black women because they are more susceptible to the lifetime damage of the sun through life. Dr. Taylor, of Yale University School of Medicine, concluded that the study could not prove the findings but they suspect the underlying cause. Light-coloured skin has been suspected {{to be one of the}} contributing factors that promote wrinkling.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to natural}} selection, {{people who lived}} in areas of intense {{sunlight}} developed dark skin colouration to protect against ultraviolet light and to protect their body mainly from folate depletion. Evolutionary pigmentation of the skin was caused by Ultraviolet Radiation (UV) of the sun. As hominids gradually lost their fur between 4.5 and 2 million years ago, to allow for better cooling through sweating, their naked and lightly <b>pigmented</b> <b>skin</b> was exposed to sunlight. In the tropics, natural selection favoured dark-skinned human populations as high levels of skin pigmentation protected against the harmful effects of sunlight. Indigenous populations’ skin reflectance (the amount of sunlight the skin reflects) and the actual UV radiation in a particular geographic area is highly correlated, which supports this idea. Genetic evidence also supports this notion, demonstrating that around 1.2 million years ago there was a strong evolutionary pressure which acted on the development of dark skin pigmentation in early members of the genus Homo. The effect of sunlight on folic acid levels has been crucial in the development of dark skin.|$|E

500|$|Dominant white {{horses are}} born with pink skin and a white coat, which they retain {{throughout}} their lives. Although the term [...] "dominant white" [...] is typically associated with a pure white coat, such horses may be all-white, near-white, partially white, or exhibit an irregular spotting pattern {{similar to that of}} sabino horses. The amount of white hair depends on which mutation of W is involved. Non-white areas of skin and hair are most commonly seen along the dorsal midline of the horse, known as the topline, and are especially common in the mane and on the ears. They may also have interspersed specks or spots of non-white skin and hair. In addition, the hooves are most often white, but may have striping if there is <b>pigmented</b> <b>skin</b> on the coronary band just above the hoof. In some cases, foals born with residual non-white hair may lose some or all of this pigment with age, without the help of the gray factor. Dominant white spotting does not affect eye color, and most dominant white horses have brown eyes. The pink skin is devoid of pigment cells (melanocytes), and appears pink from the underlying network of capillaries. White hair is rooted in unpigmented pink skin. There are many other genetic factors that produce white, near-white, and off-white coat colors in horses, some of which are visually very similar to dominant white.|$|E

2500|$|Research by Nina Jablonski {{suggests}} that an estimated time of about 10,000 to 20,000 years {{is enough for}} human populations to achieve optimal skin pigmentation in a particular geographic area but that development of ideal skin coloration may happen faster if the evolutionary pressure is stronger, even {{in as little as}} 100 generations. The length of time is also affected by cultural practices such as food intake, clothing, body coverings, and shelter usage which can alter {{the ways in which the}} environment affects populations. [...] One of the most recently proposed drivers of the evolution of skin pigmentation in humans is based on research that shows a superior barrier function in darkly <b>pigmented</b> <b>skin.</b> Most protective functions of the skin, including the permeability barrier and the antimicrobial barrier, reside in the stratum corneum (SC) and the researchers surmise that the SC has undergone the most genetic change since the loss of human body hair. Natural selection would have favored mutations that protect this essential barrier; one such protective adaptation is the pigmentation of interfollicular epidermis, because it improves barrier function as compared to non-pigmented skin. In lush rainforests, however, where UV-B radiation and xeric stress were not in excess, light pigmentation would not have been nearly as detrimental. This explains the side-by-side residence of lightly pigmented and darkly pigmented peoples.|$|E
