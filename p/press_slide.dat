40|$|Abstract—The {{application}} of gesture changed the mobile interactive process greatly, {{as well as}} User Experience (UE). For better UE, it requires information feedback triggered by gesture to accord with users ’ cognition, which {{is closely related to}} their culture and values. Many previous studies have described the differences of interaction under diverse cultural atmospheres, which confirms that cultural factors do affect the interaction process, but does this also hold for mobiles? Whether the UE is good? This study carries out a series of empirical research towards this end. The task flow of 20 apps based on Android was analyzed for extraction of gestures used with higher frequency. The ink-rhyme effect of Chinese calligraphy culture was integrated into interactive feedback to form gradient mode, which is applied to the three most familiar gestures to users — tap, <b>press,</b> <b>slide.</b> The participants judged the mode based on Hassenzahl’s surface usability questionnaire to assess UE.

Twenty trained male adults (age: 24. 5 ± 1. 7 years; weight: 77. 5 ± 7. 1 kg; height: 1. 81 ± 0. 05 m) were examined on three days within a week. Isometric leg press was performed on a negatively inclined leg <b>press</b> <b>slide.</b> Each participant completed three maximal isometric strength test sessions with different pre-information conditions given in a graphical chart: no pre-information (NPI; first day), false pre-information (FPI; bilateral force > sum of unilateral forces; second or third day) and correct pre-information (CPI; bilateral force < sum of unilateral forces; second or third day) during bilateral, unilateral-left and unilateral-right leg-press. The sum of left- and right-sided force values were calculated for bilateral (FBL = FBL_left + FBL_right) and unilateral (FUL = FUL_left + FUL_right) analyses. Force data for NPI revealed: Mean (SD) : FUL_NPI = 3023 N (435) vs. FBL_NPI = 2812 (453); FPI showed FUL_FPI = 3013 N (459) vs. FBL_FPI = 2843 (446) and the CPI revealed FUL_CPI = 3035 (425) vs. FBL_CPI = 2844 (385). The three (no, false, correct) x 2 (FUL, FBL) rANOVA revealed a high significant main effect of Force (F = 61. 82, p < 0. 001). No significant main effect of the factor Condition and no significant interaction between Force x Condition was observed. The BFD does not rely on the trueness of the given pre-information (no, false, correct). Cognition-based volitional influences on the BFD on supra-spinal level seem negligible...|$|E

30|$|Although monocrystalline silicon reveals strong {{anisotropic}} properties {{on various}} crystal planes, the friction-induced nanofabrication can be successfully realized on Si(100), Si(110), and Si(111) surfaces.

The formation mechanism of hillocks on various silicon crystal planes can be {{ascribed to the}} structural deformation of crystal matrix during nanoscratching. The silicon crystal plane with lower elastic modulus can lead to larger <b>pressed</b> volume during <b>sliding,</b> facilitating more deformation in silicon matrix and higher hillock.

40|$|Abstract. Servo press {{facilities}} {{are becoming increasingly}} used in industry and many attempts are being made to bring out their characteristic features for enhancing the formability of high-strength steel sheets. One {{of the most remarkable}} features of the servo press lies in its flexibility in slide motion control. It is thus effective to investigate the relevance of the strain rate sensitivity of a material to the mechanism of improvement in formability enabled by the flexible slide motion of the servo press. In this study, the Norton creep law was introduced in the FEM solver to take into account visco-elasto-plastic deformation including stress relaxation behavior. Parameters for the visco-elasto-plastic material model were identified through physical measurements and FEM simulations of uniaxial tension and crosshead displacement dwell tests. The identified material model was applied to sheet forming simulations of an automotive body part, and the validity of the model was examined by comparison with stamping experiments using a servo <b>press</b> with different <b>slide</b> motions. The numerical results obtained using the identified material model showed the same tendency with respect to the slide motions as the experimental results. Stress relaxation behavior was found to be an important factor for investigating formability affected by modifying the slide motion...|$|R
40|$|During forming, {{the deep}} drawing press and tools undergo large loads, {{and even though they}} are {{extremely}} sturdy structures, deformations occur. This causes changes in the geometry of the tool surface and the gap width between the tools. The deep drawing process can be very sensitive to these deformations. Tool and press deformations can be split into two categories. The deflection of the <b>press</b> bed-plate or <b>slide</b> and global deformation in the deep drawing tools are referred to as macro press deformation. Micro-deformation occurs directly at the surfaces of the forming tools and is one or two orders lower in magnitude. The goal is to include tool deformation in a FE forming simulation. This is not principally problematic, however, the FE meshes become very large, causing an extremely large increase in numerical effort. In this paper, various methods are discussed to include tool elasticity phenomena with acceptable cost. For macro deformation, modal methods or ’deformable rigid bodies’ provide interesting possibilities. Static condensation is also a well known method {{to reduce the number of}} DOFs, however the increasing bandwidth of the stiffness matrix limits this method severely, and decreased calculation times are not expected. At the moment, modeling Micro-deformation remains unfeasible. Theoretically, it can be taken into account, but the results may not be reliable due to the limited size of the tool meshes and due to approximations in the contact algorithms...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{solution}} for euphonium or tuba {{is called a}} compensating system, and these {{have been made in}} both three- and four-valve versions. In a compensating system, the tubing from the final valve is routed back to the first valve, and each of the valves before the final one is fitted with a short valve slide in addition to the normal ones. When the third or fourth valve, as applicable, is depressed in combination with any of the other valves, the additional tubing brings the pitch into tune. This has the primary effect of making the lowest octave playable including B natural (unplayable on non-compensating horns), and a secondary effect of putting low B natural and C natural into tune. Compensating systems add weight and [...] "stuffiness" [...] to a horn, so they are not commonly fitted to tubas. They find principal use in euphoniums, in which virtually all professional models are compensating. Some French horns have an altogether different system: they have a complete set of slides on each valve in B, parallel to the F <b>slides.</b> <b>Pressing</b> a separate trigger routes the air through the B slides vice the F slides, and via shorter tubing to the bell.

We asked whether the X chromosomes of the germ cells never undergo inactivation in their ontogeny or whether inactivation of an X chromosome does occur but {{is followed by a}} subsequent reactivation event. Our approach has used an electrophoretic polymorphism for the X-linked enzyme glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) in the mouse species Mus caroli. G 6 PD is dimeric, and a heterodimer is produced in cells from heterozygous females if and only if both X chromosomes are active. Ovaries from heterozygous fetuses at different gestational ages were dissected and either studied cytologically or <b>pressed</b> between microscopy <b>slides</b> to obtain germ cell-rich and germ cell-poor preparations.

Consideration of (i) the G 6 PD activity per germ cell and per somatic cell and (ii) the percentage of germ cells in the germ cell-rich preparations indicated that a heterodimer band should have been visible on the 10 th day had both X chromosomes been active.

Materials and Methods: A tissue conditioner (Visco-gel) used as a functional impression material was disinfected by immersion in 5. 25 % sodium hypochlorite or 2 % glutaraldehyde solutions for 10 or 20 minutes, respectively. The control group consisted of specimens (n= 10) that were not treated by disinfectants. For testing the dimensional stability, impressions of an aluminum edentulous arch with three reference points were made. After 24 hours of storage in distilled water, the specimens were treated by one of the disinfection procedures. Impressions were poured and, subsequently, 50 stone casts were measured with a Nikon profile projector. For surface roughness evaluation, disks that contained Visco-gel were <b>pressed</b> against glass <b>slides.</b> The disks were then stored in distilled water for 24 hours. After disinfection, 50 disk-shaped dental stone casts were prepared. Surface roughness values were determined using a profilometer.
