5|$|Large single {{crystals}} (many cubic centimeters) can {{be grown}} by the gas transport (vapor-phase deposition), hydrothermal synthesis, or melt growth. However, because of high vapor pressure of ZnO, growth from the melt is problematic. Growth by gas transport is difficult to control, leaving the hydrothermal method as a preference. Thin films can be produced by chemical vapor deposition, metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy, electrodeposition, <b>pulsed</b> <b>laser</b> deposition, sputtering, sol-gel synthesis, atomic layer deposition, spray pyrolysis, etc.|$|E
5|$|Low-pressure {{deposition}} of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in diamond growth, {{the major problem}} is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas, boron trifluoride is used for c-BN. Ion beam deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, <b>pulsed</b> <b>laser</b> deposition, reactive sputtering, and other physical vapor deposition methods are used as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pulsed</b> <b>laser</b> {{deposition}} (PLD) is {{a physical}} vapor deposition (PVD) technique where a high-power <b>pulsed</b> <b>laser</b> beam is focused inside a vacuum chamber to strike a target of the material {{that is to be}} deposited. This material is vaporized from the target (in a plasma plume) which deposits it as a thin film on a substrate (such as a silicon wafer facing the target). This process can occur in ultra high vacuum or {{in the presence of a}} background gas, such as oxygen which is commonly used when depositing oxides to fully oxygenate the deposited films.|$|E

25|$|MALDI {{methodology}} is a three-step process. First, {{the sample}} is mixed with a suitable matrix material and applied to a metal plate. Second, a <b>pulsed</b> <b>laser</b> irradiates the sample, triggering ablation and desorption of the sample and matrix material. Finally, the analyte molecules are ionized by being protonated or deprotonated in the hot plume of ablated gases, and can then be accelerated into whichever mass spectrometer is used to analyse them.|$|E

25|$|Photoinhibition {{can also}} be induced with short flashes of light using either a <b>pulsed</b> <b>laser</b> or a xenon flash lamp. When very short flashes are used, the photoinhibitory {{efficiency}} of the flashes depends on the time difference between the flashes. This dependence has been interpreted {{to indicate that the}} flashes cause photoinhibition by inducing recombination reactions in PSII, with subsequent production of singlet oxygen. The interpretation has been criticized by noting that the photoinhibitory efficiency of xenon flashes depends on the energy of the flashes even if such strong flashes are used that they would saturate the formation of the substrate of the recombination reactions.|$|E
25|$|Laser {{desorption}} electrospray ionization (LDESI) {{mass spectrometry}} is an ambient ionization technique applicable to {{plant and animal}} tissue imaging, live-cell imaging, and most recently to cell-by-cell imaging. This technique uses a mid-IR laser to ablate the sample which creates a cloud of neutral molecules. This cloud is then hit with the electrospray from above to cause ionization. The desorbed ions are then able to pass into the mass spectrometer for analysis. This method is also good for imaging in applications. The analyses can be desorbed through a <b>pulsed</b> <b>laser</b> irradiation without the need of a matrix. This method is best used with small organic molecules up to larger biomolecules as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pulsed</b> <b>laser</b> {{deposition}} is {{only one}} of many thin film deposition techniques. Other methods include molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), sputter deposition (RF, magnetron, and ion beam). The history of laser-assisted film growth started soon after the technical realization of the first laser in 1960 by Maiman. Smith and Turner utilized a ruby laser to deposit the first thin films in 1965, three years after Breech and Cross studied the laser-vaporization and excitation of atoms from solid surfaces. However, the deposited films were still inferior to those obtained by other techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy. In the early 1980s, a few research groups (mainly in the former USSR) achieved remarkable results on manufacturing of thin film structures utilizing laser technology. The breakthrough came in 1987 when Dijkkamp, Xindi Wu and Venkatesan were able to laser deposit a thin film of YBa2Cu3O7, a high temperature superconductive material, which was of superior quality to that of films deposited with alternative techniques. Since then, the technique of <b>pulsed</b> <b>laser</b> deposition has been utilized to fabricate high quality crystalline films, such as doped garnet thin films for use as planar waveguide lasers. The deposition of ceramic oxides, nitride films, metallic multilayers and various superlattices has been demonstrated. In the 1990s the development of new laser technology, such as lasers with high repetition rate and short pulse durations, made PLD a very competitive tool for the growth of thin, well defined films with complex stoichiometry.|$|E

25|$|For matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass {{spectrometry}} a solid or liquid sample {{is mixed with}} a matrix solution, to help the sample avoid processes such as aggregation or precipitation, while helping the sample remain stable during the ionization process. The matrix crystallizes with the sample and is then deposited on a sample plate, which can be made {{of a range of}} materials, from inert metals to inert polymers. The matrix containing the sample molecules is then transferred to the gas phase by <b>pulsed</b> <b>laser</b> irradiation. The makeup of the matrix, interactions between the sample and the matrix, and how the sample is deposited are all extremely important during sample preparation to ensure the best possible results.|$|E
25|$|Wide-field multiphoton {{microscopy}} {{refers to}} an optical non-linear imaging technique tailored for ultrafast imaging in which a large area of the object is illuminated and imaged {{without the need for}} scanning. High intensities are required to induce non-linear optical processes such as two-photon fluorescence or second harmonic generation. In scanning multiphoton microscopes the high intensities are achieved by tightly focusing the light, and the image is obtained by stage- or beam-scanning the sample. In wide-field multiphoton microscopy the high intensities are best achieved using an optically amplified <b>pulsed</b> <b>laser</b> source to attain a large field of view (~100Âµm). The image in this case is obtained as a single frame with a CCD without the need of scanning, making the technique particularly useful to visualize dynamic processes simultaneously across the object of interest. With wide-field multiphoton microscopy the frame rate can be increased up to a 1000-fold compared to multiphoton scanning microscopy.|$|E
