5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of around five months. Within {{a few days}} of the impending birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may lie down and stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act out of sync with normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or anal <b>prolapse</b> may also occur, in which case either stitching or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E
5|$|Drug {{collectors}} {{have certain}} traditions {{which may be}} accurate or may be exaggerated. Precautions are rightly taken when gathering hellebore, and men cannot dig it up for long; whereas the story that the peony must be dug up at night for fear that a woodpecker will watch and cause the man a rectal <b>prolapse</b> is a mere superstition. Similarly {{the idea that you}} must mark three circles around a mandrake plant with a sword, and speak of the mysteries of love while cutting it, is just far-fetched.|$|E

The best hemlock comes from Susa, while dittany, useful in childbirth, comes only from Crete. Wolfsbane comes from Crete and Zakynthos; it can be made into a poison that causes death a year or more after taking it, and there is no antidote. Hemlock is a poison which brings a painless death; pepper and frankincense are antidotes for it. Strykhnos causes madness, but oleander root in wine makes people gentle and cheerful.

25|$|Mucosal <b>prolapse</b> (partial rectal mucosal <b>prolapse)</b> {{refers to}} <b>prolapse</b> of the {{loosening}} of the submucosal attachments to the muscularis propria of the distal rectummucosal {{layer of the}} rectal wall. Most sources define mucosal <b>prolapse</b> as an external, segmental <b>prolapse</b> which is easily confused with prolapsed (3rd or 4th degree) hemorrhoids (piles). However, both internal mucosal <b>prolapse</b> (see below) and circumferential mucosal <b>prolapse</b> are described by some. Others do not consider mucosal <b>prolapse</b> a true form of rectal <b>prolapse.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rectal mucosal <b>prolapse</b> (mucosal <b>prolapse,</b> anal mucosal <b>prolapse)</b> is a {{sub-type of}} rectal <b>prolapse,</b> and refers to {{abnormal}} descent of the rectal mucosa through the anus. It is different {{to an internal}} intussusception (occult <b>prolapse)</b> or a complete rectal <b>prolapse</b> (external <b>prolapse,</b> procidentia) because these conditions involve the full thickness of the rectal wall, rather than only the mucosa (lining).|$|E
40|$|Background : Urinary {{incontinence}} {{is extremely}} common complaint {{in every part}} of the world. It causes a great deal of distress and embarrassment, as well as significant cost, to both individual and societies. Urinary incontinence and pelvic organ <b>prolapsed</b> commonly coexist. The prevalence of women presenting with pelvic organ <b>prolapsed</b> are also diagnosed with urinary incontinence was 25 - 35 % and some studies shows higher prevalence Urinary incontinence gives significant impact on social and productivity of the women. Objective: To determine the prevalence of urinary incontinence in women with pelvic organ <b>prolapsed.</b> Methods: This study is a descriptive study in 67 samples in women with pelvic organ <b>prolapsed.</b> Samples were obtained non-randomly by using consecutive sampling. All samples were examined using Pelvic Organ Prolepses Quantification (POPQ) procedure to measure degrees of <b>prolapsed.</b> An interview, measurement of residual urine, stress test, bladder diary recording, and urinalysis were performed to investigate presence of urinary incontinence and its type.   The data obtained analyzed descriptively for baseline characteristic and to determine its prevalence of urinary incontinence. Results: Prevalence of urinary incontinence in women with pelvic organ <b>prolapsed</b> was 37, 32 %, consist of 31, 32 % stress type, 1. 49 % overactive bladder, and 4. 47 % overflow incontinence. There was no mixed urinary incontinence found in this study. Prevalence of urinary incontinence was 16. 42 % and 20. 90 % on those with I-II degrees and III- IV degrees of pelvic organ <b>prolapsed</b> respectively. Conclusion: Prevalence of urinary incontinence in women with pelvic organ <b>prolapsed</b> was 37, 32 %. </p...|$|R

25|$|Mucosal <b>prolapse</b> can be {{differentiated}} from a full thickness external rectal <b>prolapse</b> (a complete rectal <b>prolapse)</b> by {{the orientation}} of the folds (furrows) in the prolapsed section. In full thickness rectal <b>prolapse,</b> these folds run circumferential. In mucosal <b>prolapse,</b> these folds are radially. The folds in mucosal <b>prolapse</b> are usually associated with internal hemorrhoids.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} {{conditions}} known as Mucosal <b>prolapse</b> syndrome (MPS) {{has now been}} recognized. It includes SRUS, rectal <b>prolapse,</b> proctitis cystica profunda, and inflammatory polyps. It is classified as a chronic benign inflammatory disorder.

40|$|The commonest {{pathologic}} {{diagnosis of}} large <b>prolapsed</b> polyps is leiomyoma. Benign or malignant adenomyomatous polyps follow. Adenomyotic cyst {{is a rare}} form of adenomyosis. To our knowledge, a recurrent <b>prolapsed</b> giant uterine polyp comprised of adenomyotic cysts and with different pathogenesis from the original polyp has not {{been reported in the}} literature. This case report describes a 29 year old woman with meno/metrrorrhagia, who was found to have a large recurrent uterine polyp <b>prolapsed</b> into the vagina at {{two and a half years}} after removal of an initial large uterine polyp. The initial polyp was a large uterine leiomyoma protruding through cervix. The recurrent giant polyp was comprised of adenomyotic cysts.

40|$|Abstract. To {{assess the}} {{incidence}} of risk factors, management and outcome of umbilical cord <b>prolapsed</b> in a university hospital setting. A retrospective chart review of women who had cord <b>prolapsed</b> at King Abdulaziz University Hospital {{over a period of}} eight years. During the study period there were 49 cases of cord <b>prolapsed</b> (0. 15 % incidence), which includes seven cases of cord presentation. The mean maternal age was 30. 31 years. The majority was booked cases (71. 4 %) and 5 were less than gravida (73. 5 %). In 10. 2 % labor was induced. The incidence of abnormal fetal presentation was 16 %, and in six patients the onset of labor was before 31 weeks. The mean diagnosis to delivery interval was approximately 23 minutes; with the exception of two vaginal deliveries and one ventouse delivery, all women underwent crash cesarean delivery. There were 11 admissions to the NICU/SCBU and four mortalities, giving an overall perinatal mortality of 8. 15 %. In two of the mortality cases there were potentially avoidable factors; the remaining ones were extremely premature babies. Cord <b>prolapsed</b> is still a serious obstetric emergency. The diagnosis to delivery interval is a crucial factor in the management of cord <b>prolapsed.</b> All obstetric units should maintain continuous drills on crash cesarean deliveries...|$|R

25|$|Vaginal <b>prolapse</b> is {{characterized}} by a portion of the vaginal canal protruding (prolapsing) from the opening of the vagina. It may result in the case of weakened pelvic muscles, which is a common result of childbirth; in the case of this <b>prolapse,</b> the rectum, uterus, or bladder pushes on the vagina, and severe cases result in the vagina protruding out of the body. Kegel exercises have been used to strengthen the pelvic floor, and may help prevent or remedy vaginal <b>prolapse.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{investigation}} objectively {{documents the}} functional {{status of the}} sphincters. However, the clinical significance of the findings are disputed by some. It {{may be used to}} assess for pelvic floor dyssenergia, (anismus is a contraindication for certain surgeries, e.g. STARR), and these patients may benefit from post-operative biofeedback therapy. Decreased squeeze and resting pressures are usually the findings, and this may predate the development of the <b>prolapse.</b> Resting tone is usually preserved in patients with mucosal <b>prolapse.</b> In patients with reduced resting pressure, levatorplasty may be combined with <b>prolapse</b> repair to further improve continence.|$|E
25|$|Some {{believe that}} {{internal}} rectal intussusception represents the initial {{form of a}} progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external rectal <b>prolapse.</b> The intermediary stages would be gradually increasing sizes of intussusception. However, internal intussusception rarely progresses to external rectal <b>prolapse.</b> The factors that result in a patient progressing from internal intussusception to a full thickness rectal <b>prolapse</b> remain unknown. Defecography studies demonstrated that degrees of internal intussusception are present in 40% of asymptomatic subjects, raising {{the possibility that it}} represents a normal variant in some, and may predispose patients to develop symptoms, or exacerbate other problems.|$|E
30|$|The repair {{approach}} used (abdominal, vaginal, or a combined approach) depends on several factors [1]: (1) {{the viability of}} the <b>prolapsed</b> bowel and its mesentery, (2) the surgeon’s ability to reduce the <b>prolapsed</b> intestine, and (3) the exposure to the operative field; poor exposure may exist secondary to morbid obesity or inability to flex the lower extremities enough to place them in the lithotomy position.|$|R
