It is found that CAO in the early period were both more persistent and severe than those in the modern control period.

40|$|The {{climate in}} Pakistan is {{characterized}} by distinct summer and winter south Asian monsoon systems. As Pakistan locates at the transit zone from central to southern Asia, its climate variability is subject to <b>planetary</b> <b>circulation</b> forcings and regional interactions with complex surface characteristics.

5|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{relation}} {{does not explain}} why the winds are organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor {{that contributes to the}} creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front. This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of <b>planetary</b> wind <b>circulations</b> that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.|$|R
40|$|Hot Jupiter atmospheres exhibit fast, weakly-ionized winds. The {{interaction}} of these winds with the planetary magnetic field generates {{drag on the}} winds and leads to ohmic dissipation of the induced electric currents. We study the magnitude of ohmic dissipation in representative, three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models of the hot Jupiter HD 209458 b. We find that ohmic dissipation can reach or exceed 1 % of the stellar insolation power in the deepest atmospheric layers, in models with and without dragged winds. Such power, dissipated in the deep atmosphere, appears sufficient to slow down planetary contraction and explain the typically inflated radii of hot Jupiters.

This model involves idealized thermally driven congestus synoptic-scale fluctuations {{in the eastern part}} of the moving wave envelope and convective superclusters in the western part of the envelope. The model self-consistently reproduces qualitatively many of the detailed structural features of the <b>planetary</b> <b>circulation</b> in the observations of the MJO, including the vertical structure in both the westerly onset region and the strong westerly wind burst region, as well as the horizontal quadrupole planetary vortex structure. The westerly midlevel inflow in the strong westerly region and the quadrupole vortex are largely produced in the model by the upscale transport of momentum to the planetary scales, while the midlevel easterly jet in the westerly onset region is substantially strengthened by this process. The role of wave trains of tilted organized synoptic-scale circulations is crucial for this fidelity with observations. The appeal of the multiscale models developed below is their firm mathematical underpinnings, simplicity, and analytic tractability while remaining self-consistent with many of the features of the observational record. 1...|$|E
40|$|Amidst stormy {{atmospheric}} circulation, {{there are}} prominent recurrent patterns of {{variability in the}} <b>planetary</b> <b>circulation,</b> such as the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO), Arctic Oscillation (AO) or North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Pacific–North America (PNA) pattern. The role of the synoptic eddy and low-frequency flow (SELF) feedback {{in the formation of}} these dominant low-frequency modes is investigated in this paper using the linear barotropic model with the SELF feedback proposed in Part I. It is found that the AO-like and AAO-like leading singular modes of the linear dynamical system emerge from the stormy background flow {{as the result of a}} positive SELF feedback. This SELF feedback also prefers a PNA-like singular vector as well among other modes under the climatological conditions of northern winters. A model with idealized conditions of basic mean flow and activity of synoptic eddy flow and a prototype model are also used to illustrate that there is a natural scale selection for the AAO- and AO-like modes through the positive SELF feedback. The zonal scale of the localized features in the Atlantic (southern Indian Ocean) for AO (AAO) is largely related to the zonal extent of the enhanced storm track activity in the region. The meridional dipole structures of AO- and AAO-like low-frequency modes are favored because of the scale-selective positive SELF feedback, which can be heuristically understood by the tiltedtrough mechanism. 1...|$|E

The new modelling schemes were substituted far the control model's parameterizations of moist convection, planetary boundary layer, ground hydrology, and cloud optical thickness {{in a series of}} sensitivity experiments. In addition, linear and quadratic upstream schemes for advecting tracers were tried in place of second-order differencing. Elimination of the vertical mixing of horizontal momentum by moist convection was also tested. Impacts of the new modelling schemes on simulated circulation, temperature, and precipitation rates were inferred from pairs of simulations made by model versions that differed with respect to a single change. No discernible positive impacts were found for the new ground hydrology scheme or for changes in the determination of cloud optical thickness. Profiles of zonal wind speeds and lower tropospheric circulation patterns, both in the tropics, were more realistic when the vertical mixing of horizontal momentum was included.

40|$|A <b>planetary</b> global <b>circulation</b> model {{developed}} by the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique (LMD) was used to simulate explosive eruptions of ancient martian volcanoes into paleo-atmospheres with higher atmospheric pressures than that of present-day Mars. Atmospheric pressures in the model were varied between 50 mbar and 2 bars. In this way {{it was possible to}} investigate the sensitivity of the volcanic plume dispersal model to atmospheric pressure. It was determined that the model has a sensitivity to pressure that is similar to its sensitivity to other atmospheric parameters such as planetary obliquity and season of eruption. Higher pressure atmospheres allow volcanic plumes to convect to higher levels, meaning that volcanic pyroclasts have further to fall through the atmosphere. Changes in atmospheric circulation due to pressure cause pyroclasts to be dispersed in narrower latitudinal bands compared with pyroclasts in a modern atmosphere. Atmospheric winds are generally slower under higher pressure regimes; however, the final distance traveled by the pyroclasts depends greatly on the location of the volcano and can either increase or decrease with pressure. The directionality of the pyroclast transport, however, remains dominantly east or west along lines of latitude.
