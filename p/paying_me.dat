500|$|Lester {{was offered}} {{producing}} credit but refused, going uncredited for his work. Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant {{there would be}} someone ready {{in the event that}} Donner could not fulfill his directing duties. [...] "Being there all the time meant he [...] could take over," [...] Salkind admitted. [...] " [...] couldn't make up his mind on stuff." [...] On Lester, Donner reflected, [...] "He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on Three and Four Musketeers, which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and I told him. He said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're <b>paying</b> <b>me</b> the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I'll never go to your dailies. If I can help you in any way, call me." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 21 October 2012, Van Damme {{was honored}} with a life-size statue {{of himself in}} his {{hometown}} of Brussels. He told reporters during the unveiling, [...] "Belgium is <b>paying</b> <b>me</b> back something, but really it's to pay back to the dream. So when people come by here, it is not Jean-Claude Van Damme but it's a guy from the street who believed in something. I want the statue to represent that".|$|E

2500|$|White {{is known}} for {{drinking}} Scotch {{as part of his}} act, as well as smoking cigars or cigarettes. He stated during his You Can't Fix Stupid show, [...] "Somebody asked what I was drinking. If the company that made the stuff I was drinking was <b>paying</b> <b>me,</b> I'd have it in their bottle and not mine. But it's the kind of scotch that people drink that are going to die penniless. It's good though!" [...] In 2009 Comedy Central released Ron's stand up DVD Behavioral Problems.|$|E
2500|$|Malone {{would often}} rebound his own misses. He would rush shots {{close to the}} basket knowing {{that he had the}} {{strength}} and quickness to recover the ball before his opponents. Some of his peers contended that he intentionally missed shots to pad his rebounding statistics. Malone wore down his opponents with his relentless effort and physical play. He was not a very good passer. When Carroll Dawson, an assistant coach with the Rockets, suggested that Malone needed to improve his passing, he replied that [...] "they ain't <b>paying</b> <b>me</b> to pass." ...|$|E

In the weeks before her death in 1923, she was preparing to make another motion picture from her own home, La Voyante, directed by Sacha Guitry. She told journalists, [...] "They're <b>paying</b> <b>me</b> ten thousand francs a day, and plan to film for seven days. Make the calculation. These are American rates, and I don't have to cross the Atlantic! At those rates, I'm ready to appear in any films they make." [...] However, she died just before the filming began.|$|E

2500|$|A {{year after}} his dismissal, in July 1991, Adler {{filed a lawsuit against}} his former Guns N' Roses band mates, contending that he was fired because the opiate-blocking drug he had been taking to aid his detox {{interfered}} with his concentration. He also alleged that the contract he had been made to sign took away his financial interest in the band, stating, [...] "I was told that every time I did heroin, the band would fine me $2,000. ... What these contracts actually said was that the band were <b>paying</b> <b>me</b> $2,000 to leave. They were taking my royalties, all my writing credits. They didn't like me any more and just wanted me gone." [...] The case was settled out of court in 1993; Adler received a back-payment check of $2,250,000 and was granted 15% of the royalties for everything he recorded prior to his departure.|$|E

[...] Pat blamed it on Eamon Dunphy. [...] "Are you bored with the wood puns?" [...] they asked to which Pat jibed: [...] "In fairness lads I'm not the puppet round here." [...] Then {{it was time for a}} quick game of [...] "Plankety Plank" [...] which featured author Patricia Cornwell - he'd forgotten her name; Dawn French - he'd told her he'd give her €10 not to get out of bed; Brigitte Nielsen - she'd forced him to dance live on TV.

5000|$|From the investor's {{point of}} view, a {{structured}} note {{might look like}} this: I agree to a three-year contract with a bank. I give the bank $100. The money will be indexed to the S&P 500. In three years, if the S&P has gone up, the bank will <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> $100 plus the gain in the S&P. However, if the S&P has gone down, the bank will <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> back the entire $100 - an advantage known as downside protection. (In reality the downside protection is usually [...] "contingent", i.e. it only applies {{up to a certain}} threshold amount. For example, with a threshold of 40%, if the S&P has gone down by more than 40%, the bank will no longer <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> back $100, but instead it will <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> the proportional value indexed to the S&P - e.g. $55 if the S&P has gone down by 45%. Because no such actual security exists outside of the sponsor creating such hybrid, the creditworthiness of this structured note depends on the strength of the sponsor.|$|R
