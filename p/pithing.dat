5|$|Methods of euthanizing {{laboratory}} {{animals are}} chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal {{can be made}} to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. <b>Pithing</b> (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.|$|E
25|$|Historically, some {{doubted that}} fish could {{experience}} pain. Laboratory experiments {{have shown that}} fish do react to painful stimuli (e.g., injections of bee venom) {{in a similar way}} to mammals. This is controversial and has been disputed. The expansion of fish farming as well as animal welfare concerns in society has led to research into more humane and faster ways of killing fish. In large-scale operations like fish farms, stunning fish with electricity or putting them into water saturated with nitrogen so that they cannot breathe, results in death more rapidly than just taking them out of the water. For sport fishing, it is recommended that fish be killed soon after catching them by hitting them on the head followed by bleeding out or by stabbing the brain with a sharp object (called <b>pithing</b> or ike jime in Japanese).|$|E

2500|$|Several {{methods are}} used for killing {{lobsters}}. [...] The most common way of killing lobsters is by placing them live in boiling water, sometimes after having been placed in a freezer {{for a period of}} time. [...] Another method is to split the lobster or sever the body in half lengthwise. Lobsters may also be killed or rendered insensate immediately before boiling by a stab into the brain (<b>pithing),</b> in the belief that this will stop suffering. However, a lobster's brain operates from not one but several ganglia and disabling only the frontal ganglion does not usually result in death. The boiling method is illegal in some places, such as in Reggio Emilia, Italy, where offenders face fines up to €495. Lobsters can be killed by electrocution prior to cooking, with one device, the CrustaStun, applying a 110-volt, 2 to 5 amp electrical charge to the animal.|$|E

50|$|Captive bolt : Commonly {{used for}} cattle and other livestock. The bolt is fired through the {{forehead}} causing massive {{disruption of the}} cerebral cortex. In cattle, this stuns the animal, though if left for a prolonged period it will die from cerebral oedema. Death should therefore be rapidly brought about by <b>pithing</b> or exsanguination. Horses are killed outright by the captive bolt, making <b>pithing</b> and exsanguination unnecessary.|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} the pre- and post-junctional effects {{of a series of}} alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists at alpha 2 -adrenoceptors in the <b>pithed</b> rat preparation and the human isolated saphenous vein. In the <b>pithed</b> rat, {{there was no difference in}} relative agonist and antagonist potencies between pre- and post-junctional alpha 2 -adrenoceptors but the absolute potencies of antagonists differed: antagonists were more potent prejunctionally. In the human saphenous vein, the alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine had pre- and post-junctional actions over the same concentration range. We have no evidence to suggest differences between pre- and post-junctional alpha 2 -adrenoceptors: differences in absolute antagonist potencies in the <b>pithed</b> rat may be due to non-equilibrium conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} calmodulin antagonists was studied on the alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated {{increase}} in {{diastolic blood pressure}} in <b>pithed</b> rats and on the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor-mediated reduction of flow in the perfused hindquarters of the rat. B-HT 920 {{was used as a}} selective alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist in the <b>pithed</b> rat experiments, whereas cirazoline was used as a selective agonist for alpha 1 -adrenoceptors. The latter was used after pretreatment with nifedipine (1 mg/kg) or phenoxybenzamine (30 micrograms/kg), revealing calcium influx-insensitive and -sensitive mechanisms of vasoconstriction, respectively. Papaverine, calmidazolium and W- 7 did not influence the dose-response curves for the agonists in the <b>pithed</b> rat experiments. The modest effects of high doses of flunarizine and bepridil on the dose-response curve for B-HT 920 and of trifluoperazine on the dose-response curve for cirazoline {{can be explained by the}} well-known calcium entry (flunarizine) and alpha 1 -adrenoceptor-blocking (bepridil) effects of these drugs. Bepridil and calmidazolium caused an elevation of the cirazoline dose-response curves in the perfused rat hindquarters; flunarizine and trifluoperazine showed a parallel and dose-dependent displacement of the cirazoline dose-response curve to the right, whereas W- 7 was inactive.

5000|$|<b>Pithing</b> {{is viewed}} as a humane way of killing an animal {{that is going to be}} {{slaughtered}} or destroyed for disease control or humane reasons, for example an animal which is severely injured in an accident. When animals must be killed humanely on farm for disease control purposes or in an emergency situation, disposable <b>pithing</b> rods allow the slaughterman to adopt best practice. They ensure humane slaughter, seal the stunning hole reducing bleeding and so provide good biosecurity protection and eliminate the need to bleed out the animal. Disposable devices will help to ensure that the rods do not represent a risk of disease spread, and that they remain with the animal when it is disposed. In the case of outbreak of notifiable or epidemic disease, government agencies and welfare organisations may develop contingency plans. [...] "Planned stocking" [...] may be necessary to ensure that rods are available at short notice in the event of a disease outbreak.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pithing,</b> {{also known}} as ikejime (or ikijime), {{involves}} sticking a sharp spike through the brain of the fish. If done properly, it can kill quickly, however, if the operator misses the brain, the results may be stressful for the fish. As with percussive stunning, spiking is used to kill one fish {{at a time and}} so is mainly used for large species such as tuna and salmon.|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} with alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, and the antihypertensive and hypotensive effects of urapidil were studied in various animal models. Urapidil reduced the {{mean arterial pressure}} (MAP) of conscious normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rates after oral administration. Urapidil antagonized alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction in <b>pithed</b> rats, elicited by cirazoline and B-HT 920, respectively. Urapidil itself caused pressor responses of limited magnitude at high doses in <b>pithed</b> rats, which were not blocked by yohimbine, prazosin or ketanserin. Urapidil displayed partial beta 1 -adrenoceptor intrinsic activity in <b>pithed</b> rats. Urapidil was more potent in reducing MAP after infusion via the vertebral artery as compared to infusion via the femoral artery of chloralose-anaesthetized cats. The results suggest that urapidil reduces blood pressure via blockade of peripheral vascular alpha-adrenoceptors, and beta-receptor blockade.

The maximal responses for these parameters {{were similar to those}} to noradrenaline, except for the rise in diastolic blood pressure, where noradrenaline caused a greater increase than angiotensin II. After treatment with propranolol, the positive chronotropic effect of angiotensin II was abolished. Angiotensin II produced a dose-dependent increase in diastolic blood pressure, which was similar to that of vasopressin, and an increase in dP/dtmax, which proved much greater than that of vasopressin. When aortic blood pressure was controlled and the beta-receptors were blocked by propranolol, angiotensin II caused a dose-dependent increase in dP/dtmax without affecting the left ventricular enddiastolic pressure.
