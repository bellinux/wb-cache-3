Both are legal operations that lead to the termination of legal effects of <b>administrative</b> <b>acts.</b> A controversial issue is the one regarding the authorities that may exercise the right of revocation and annulment of an <b>administrative</b> <b>act.</b> As concerns normative <b>administrative</b> <b>acts,</b> the specific manner of termination of enforcement of such acts is to repeal them. On the relationship between repeal {{on the one hand and}} cancellation and revocation on the other hand, various contradictory opinions were voiced in the legal doctrine. An aspect with important implications in the administrative practice is the one concerning the possibility of invalidating a normative <b>administrative</b> <b>act</b> before its entering into force. Finally, the article deals with the notion of non-existent <b>administrative</b> <b>acts,</b> which has become a constitutional institution as concerns <b>administrative</b> normative <b>acts...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{activity}} of administrative bodies includes big numbers of various acts and actions, {{through which the}} will of public administration is formed. The will of public administration bodies, expressed in administrative individual and normative <b>acts,</b> in <b>administrative</b> contracts and real acts, finds its reflection in the Constitution, laws and other provisions of legal character. All this activity is not inerrant and therefore, it is not uncontrollable. The supervision of executive activity is subject to political control of <b>administrative</b> <b>acts</b> through authorities designated for this purpose, as well as internal control and the judicial control. The institution of judicial control of <b>administrative</b> <b>acts</b> and actions appears as very important and widely treated in the legal doctrine. The protection of constitutional and legal rights of private persons is accomplished by subjecting administrative activity both to internal administrative control, {{as well as to}} the judicial control in accordance with legal provisions. The judicial control of <b>administrative</b> <b>acts</b> represents a constitutional guarantee for citizens to protect their rights through public and fair trial by an independent and impartial court. In this way, the Constitution empowers the common administrative court that invalidates an action or <b>administrative</b> <b>act,</b> but not all <b>administrative</b> <b>acts</b> may be subject to administrative dispute, with the exception of cases against which the administrative conflict cannot be carried out (negative enumeration) ...|$|R

The purpose of this paper is to determine what kinds of textual strategies and devices (including text types) are employed in orders, decisions, and directives for the purpose of achieving a genre-specific goal. Since the law specifies the issuer of the act, their sphere of competence, and the conditions for the issuance of the act, it can be presumed that some of the genre-specific characteristics are related to extra-linguistic factors. This paper focuses on the general and sentence structure of <b>administrative</b> <b>acts,</b> in order to determine whether such acts can be regarded as a distinct genre based on linguistic properties as well.
