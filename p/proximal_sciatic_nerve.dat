5000|$|Use of {{magnetic}} resonance neurography is increasing in neurology and neurosurgery as {{the implications of}} its value in diagnosing various causes of sciatica becomes more widespread. There are 1.5 million lumbar MRI scans performed in the US each year for sciatica, leading to surgery for a herniated disk in about 300,000 patients per year. Of these, about 100,000 surgeries fail. Therefore, there is successful treatment for sciatica in just 200,000 and failure of diagnosis or treatment in up to 1.3 million annually in the US alone. The success rate of the paradigm of lumbar MRI and disk resection for treatment of sciatica is therefore about 15%(Filler 2005). Neurography has been applied increasingly to evaluate the distal nerve roots, lumbo-sacral plexus and <b>proximal</b> <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> in the pelvis and thigh to find other causes of sciatica. It is increasingly important for brachial plexus imaging and for the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome. [...] Research and development in the clinical use of diagnostic neurography has taken place at Johns Hopkins, the Mayo Clinic, UCLA, UCSF, Harvard, the University of Washington in Seattle, University of London, and Oxford University (see references below) {{as well as through}} the Neurography Institute. Recent patent litigation concerning MR Neurography has led some unlicensed centers to discontinue offering the technique. Courses have been offered for radiologists at the annual meetings of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), and at the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and for surgeons at the annual meetings of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons. The use of imaging for diagnosis of nerve disorders represents a change from the way most physicians were trained to practice over the past several decades, as older routine tests fail to identify the diagnosis for nerve related disorders. The New England Journal of Medicine in July 2009 published a report on whole body neurography using a diffusion based neurography technique. In 2010, RadioGraphics - a publication of the Radiological Society of North America that serves to provide continuing medical education to radiologists - published an article series taking the position that Neurography has {{an important role in the}} evaluation of entrapment neuropathies.|$|E

Each will be discussed in turn. Damage to the <b>Proximal</b> <b>Sciatic</b> <b>Nerve</b> by Lesions in the Vicinity of the Piriformis Muscle. Lesions of the prox-imal sciatic nerve {{in the area of the}} sciatic notch may occur from endometriosis, tumors, hematomas, fi-brosis, aneurysms, false aneurysms, or arteriovenous malformations. Some authors have diagnosed such patients as having PS.

40|$|Electrophysiological and {{histological}} {{studies of}} peripheral nerve were performed in 24 Lewis rats with experimental allergic neuritis (EAN) in which disease had been induced {{by a single}} myelin and adjuvant inoculation in one footpad. Demyelination was demonstrated in transverse nerve sections from ventral roots, <b>proximal</b> <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves</b> and also in distal plantar nerves. Histological and electrophysiological assessments showed that injected limbs were more affected than uninjected limbs. Neurophysiological studies demonstrated two distinct patterns of conduction failure based upon proximal/distal compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude ratios in both uninjected and injected limbs. Slightly {{more than half of}} all nerve trunks showed a mildly reduced distal CMAP amplitude irrespective of stimulus origin. The rest displayed a more severe reduction of distal amplitude that was length-dependent, becoming smaller with proximal stimulation. Histological lesions in plantar nerves were often more severe than those in <b>proximal</b> <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves</b> or ventral roots. Axonal degeneration was an uncommon finding. This study has demonstrated patterns of peripheral nerve conduction impairment similar to those reported in patients with inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy. Moreover, it has shown that a low distal CMAP amplitude may result from demyelination of distal motor nerve segments and not necessarily from axonal degeneration...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{negatively}} {{regulate the}} expression of target genes at the post-transcriptional level in diverse biological processes. We have previously identified a group of novel miRNAs in <b>proximal</b> <b>nerve</b> following rat <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> transection by Solexa sequencing. In this study, the biological function and action mode of miR-sc 8, one of the above identified miRNAs, were investigated. An increased expression of miR-sc 8 inhibited cell proliferation and migration of Schwann cells (SCs), and inversely, silencing of the miR-sc 8 expression promoted cell proliferation and migration of SCs. The epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) was identified as the target gene of miR-sc 8, which exerted negative regulation of Egfr by translational suppression. The temporal change profile of the miR-sc 8 expression was negatively correlated {{with that of the}} Egfr expression in <b>proximal</b> <b>nerve</b> following <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> transection. Moreover, Knockdown of Egfr attenuated the promoting effects of miR-sc 8 inhibitor on SC proliferation and migration. Overall, our data indicate that miR-sc 8 affects phenotype modulation of SCs by targeting Egfr, providing further insights into the regulatory role of miRNAs in peripheral nerve regeneration...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral {{nervous system}} owns {{the ability of}} self-regeneration, mainly in its {{regenerative}} microenvironment including vascular network reconstruction. More recently, more attentions {{have been given to}} the close relationship between tissue regeneration and angiogenesis. To explore the overlap of molecular mechanisms and key regulation molecules between peripheral nerve regeneration and angiogenesis post peripheral nerve injury, integrative and bioinformatic analysis was carried out for microarray data of <b>proximal</b> stumps after <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> transection in SD rats. Nerve regeneration and angiogenesis were activated at 1 day immediately after <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> transection simultaneously. The more obvious changes of transcription regulators and canonical pathways suggested a phase transition between 1 and 4 days of both nerve regeneration and angiogenesis after <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> transection. Furthermore, 16 differentially expressed genes participated in significant biological processes of both nerve regeneration and angiogenesis, a few of which were validated by qPCR and immunofluorescent staining. It was demonstrated that STAT 3, EPHB 3, and Cdc 42 co-expressed in Schwann cells and vascular endothelial cells to {{play a key role in}} regulation of nerve regeneration and angiogenesis simultaneously response to <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> transection. We provide a framework for understanding biological processes and precise molecular correlations between peripheral nerve regeneration and angiogenesis after peripheral nerve transection.

40|$|Metabotropic {{glutamate}} receptor 5 (mGluR 5) protein increased after {{sciatic nerve}} section in ipsilateral L 4 and L 5 DRG neuronal profiles, {{with most of}} the increase occurring in myelinated A-fiber somata. mGluR 5 also increased in lamina II of the ipsilateral spinal cord and the <b>proximal</b> <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> stump in this model. After L 5 spinal nerve ligation, mGluR 5 immunoreactivity increased dramatically not only in damaged L 5 but also in the neighboring undamaged L 4. Interestingly, after partial sciatic nerve section, mGluR 5 expression did not change in either L 4 or L 5 DRG neuronal profiles. Both spinal nerve ligation and sciatic nerve partial section produced significant mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. After partial sciatic nerve section, the mGluR 5 specific antagonist 2 -methyl- 6 -(phenylethynyl) -pyridine (MPEP) had no effect on any of these behaviors. However, after L...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—This study {{investigated}} high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in distal symmetric diabetic polyneuropathy (dPNP). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—MRN comprised high-resolution transaxial imaging of peripheral nerves {{of the lower}} limbs in 20 patients with type 2 diabetes (10 with dPNP, type 2 /dPNP[+], and 10 without dPNP, type 2 /dPNP[2]), seven patients with type 1 diabetes (two with dPNP, type 1 /dPNP[+], five without dPNP, type 1 /dPNP[2]), and 10 nondiabetic control subjects. Intraneural T 2 lesions, as the main diagnostic criterion of MRN, were detected visually by two independent observers and quantitatively by analysis of T 2 contrast ratios. RESULTS—Multifocal fascicular, symmetric intraneural T 2 lesions occurred in the <b>proximal</b> trunks of <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerves</b> in four patients (three with type 2 /dPNP[+] and one with type 1 /dPNP[+]) but not in control subjects (type 2 /dPNP[2], type 1 /dPNP[2], nondiabetic control subjects), which was confirmed by quantitative analysis.

40|$|Radiculopathy, {{a painful}} neuroinflammation that can {{accompany}} intervertebral disc herniation, {{is associated with}} locally increased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Systemic administration of TNF antagonists for radiculopathy in the clinic has shown mixed results, and there is growing interest in the local delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs to treat this pathology as well as similar inflammatory events of peripheral nerve injury. Curcumin, a known antagonist of TNFα in multiple cell types and tissues, was chemically modified and conjugated to a thermally responsive elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) to create an injectable depot for sustained, local delivery of curcumin to treat neuroinflammation. ELPs are biopolymers capable of thermally-triggered in situ depot formation that have been successfully employed as drug carriers and biomaterials in several applications. ELP-curcumin conjugates were shown to display high drug loading, rapidly release curcumin in vitro via degradable carbamate bonds, and retain in vitro bioactivity against TNFα-induced cytotoxicity and monocyte activation with IC 50 only two-fold higher than curcumin. When injected <b>proximal</b> to the <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> in mice via intramuscular (i. m.) injection, ELP-curcumin conjugates underwent a thermally triggered soluble-insoluble phase transition, leading to in situ formation of a depot that released curcumin over 4 days post-injection and decreased plasma AUC 7 -fold...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} treadmill training (10 weeks) on hindlimb motor function and nerve morphometric parameters in diabetic rats submitted to <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> crush. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Wistar rats (n = 64) were divided into the following groups: non-diabetic; trained nondiabetic; non-diabetic with <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> crush; trained non-diabetic with <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> crush; diabetic; trained diabetic; diabetic with <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> crush or trained diabetic with <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> crush. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin injection (50 mg/kg, iv). Hindlimb motor function was evaluated weekly by assessing sciatic functional indices, and the proximal and distal portions of the <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> were used for morphometric analysis. RESULTS: At 13 weeks post-injury, the distal nerve portion of all injured groups and the proximal nerve portion of the diabetic with <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> crush group presented altered morphometric parameters such as decreased myelinated fiber diameter (, 7. 4 ¡ 0. 3 mm vs, 4. 8 ¡ 0. 2 mm), axonal diameter (, 5 ¡ 0. 2 mm vs, 3. 5 ¡ 0. 1 mm) and myelin sheath thickness (, 1. 2 ¡ 0. 07 mm vs, 0. 65 ¡ 0. 07 mm) {{and an increase in}} the percentage of area occupied by endoneurium (, 28 ¡ 3 % vs, 60 ¡ 3 %). In addition, in the non-diabetic with <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> crush group the proximal nerve portion showed a decreased myelinated fiber diameter (7. 4 ¡ 0. 3 mm vs 5. 8 ¡ 0. 3 mm) and myelin sheath thickness (1. 29 ¡ 0. 08 mm vs 0. 92 ¡ 0. 08 mm). The non-diabetic with <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> crush, trained non-diabetic with <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> crush, diabetic with <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> crush and trained diabetic with <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> crush groups showed normal sciatic functional index from the 4 th, 4 th, 9 th and 7 th week post-injury, respectively. Morphometric alterations in the proximal nerve portion of the diabetic with <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> crush and non-diabetic with <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> crush groups were either prevented or reverted to values similar to the non-diabetic group by treadmill training. CONCLUSION: Diabetic condition promoted delay in <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> regeneration. Treadmill training is able to accelerate hindlimb motor function recovery in diabetic injured rats and prevent or revert morphometric alterations in proximal nerve portions in non-diabetic and diabetic injured rats...|$|R
40|$|Background Sciatica without {{evidence}} of lumbosacral root compression is often attributed to piriformis syndrome. However, specific diagnostic tools {{have not been}} available to demonstrate sciatic nerve entrapment by the piriformis muscle. Objective To evaluate the use of magnetic resonance (MR) neurography in identifying abnormalities of the sciatic nerve in patients with unexplained sciatica. Design Case series from a retrospective medical record review. Patients Fourteen patients with sciatic distribution pain and normal results on MR imaging for lumbosacral radiculopathy were referred for MR neurography of the lumbosacral plexus and sciatic nerves. Results In 12 patients, MR neurography demonstrated increased fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal in the ipsilateral sciatic nerve. In most patients, this abnormal signal was seen at the sciatic notch, at or just inferior {{to the level of}} the piriformis muscle. To date, 4 patients have undergone surgical decompression, with excellent relief of symptoms in 3 of them. Conclusion Magnetic resonance neurography often identifies an abnormal increased signal in the <b>proximal</b> <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> in patients with extraspinal sciatica and allows more accurate diagnosis of sciatic nerve entrapment in suspected cases...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe authors {{report an}} {{isolated}} case of right sacrospinous ligament ossification causing sciatic pain because of compression of the <b>proximal</b> <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve.</b> The initial conservative treatment of injections {{in the conflict}} zone and the intervertebral joints was insufficient. Surgical exploration was undertaken via a posterior approach, demonstrating {{the conflict between the}} nerve and the ossified ligament. Resection of the ossified ligament eliminated the symptoms at the cost of transitory buttock hypesthesia. The anatomic and pathologic exam identified simple osseous metaplasia. Lumbar-pelvic coxometry analysis showed sagittalization of the acetabular roofs, excessive bilateral femoral torsion, and a step-off attenuation at the anterior cervicocephalic junction (low anterior cervico-cephalic femoral offset). In addition, reduced lumbar lordosis and accentuated sacral slope were noted, factors that could be related to modifications in the static balance of the lumbar-pelvic complex. This imbalance could be correlated to an increase in the forces applied to the pelvic ligament layers. The etiological hypothesis retained was that this osseous metaplasia was a reaction to excessive stresses on the sacrospinous ligament...|$|E
40|$|We {{elicited}} H-reflexes by magnetic {{and electrical}} stimulation of several different nerves in 10 healthy subjects and two patients with S- 1 radiculopathy. The posterior tibial nerve at the popliteal fossa and the femoral nerve at the inguinal ligament were tested with both electrical and magnetic stimulation; the <b>proximal</b> <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> was tested only with magnetic stimulation. Muscle activity was recorded from the soleus muscle for posterior tibial and sciatic nerve stimulation {{and from the}} vastus medialis muscle for femoral nerve stimulation. No {{significant difference was found}} between the latency of H-reflexes evoked by magnetic or electrical stimulation. With magnetic stimulation, the mean (± SD) la sensory fiber conduction velocity in the proximal segment of the sciatic nerve was 72. 4 ± 3. 3 m/s, while the motor nerve fiber conduction velocity in the same portion of the nerve was significantly slower, at 60. 6 ± 2. 0 m/s. In two patients with unilateral S- 1 radiculopathy, the latency of the H-reflex from the soleus muscle to both magnetic and electrical stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve was absent or prolonged on the affected side. Magnetic stimulation can be used to study the H-reflex and la fiber conduction velocity and is particularly advantageous when testing deeply located nerve trunks. © 1992, American Medical Association.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{innervation}} to intact peroneal and extensor digitorum longus muscles of normal and experimental young adult mice was studied by light microscopy after staining neuromuscular junctions {{by a combined}} silver-cholinesterase stain. Spontaneous sprouting and synapse formation occur in intact muscles of normal mice. In about 7 % of the junctions, sprouts contribute to the innervation of muscle fibres already innervated by their parent axons. Axotomy of the sciatic nerve in one hind limb is followed by an average 3 -fold increase over normal {{in the incidence of}} sprouting and synapse formation in the intact muscles of the opposite hind limb. The time to onset of sprouting and synapse formation becomes shorter as the site of the contralateral axotomy is placed closer to the spinal cord. A significant increase over normal in the incidence of sprouting is first observed 5 days after a <b>proximal</b> <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> cut and only 12 days after a distal sciatic nerve cut. The timing of sprouting is independent of the difference in the number of axons that are involved in the contralateral axotomies at different sites. These findings suggest that, in the intact muscles of normal mice, sprouting and synapse formation is an ongoing process which can be enhanced by contralateral axotomy. As in frogs (Rotshenker, 1979, 1982) the underlying mechanism may be the transneuronal induction of sprouting and synapse formation...|$|E
40|$|Study Objective: To {{present the}} use of {{ultrasonography}} {{for the performance of}} proximal subgluteal and distal sciatic nerve blocks in children. Design: Prospective descriptive study. Setting: University hospital. Patients: 45 ASA physical status I, II, and III patients, aged between 8 months and 16 years, scheduled for lower limb surgery. Interventions: During general anesthesia, proximal, subgluteal, and distal sciatic nerve blocks using ultrasonography were performed. If severe postoperative pain was expected, a catheter technique was used. Measurements: The injected amount of local anesthetic was noted. Based on the spread of local anesthetic, prediction for successful block was made. Complications, adverse effects, postoperative pain scores, and parent satisfaction scores were noted. Main Results: 21 <b>proximal</b> <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> blocks (12 single-injection and 9 continuous blocks) and 35 distal sciatic nerve blocks (17 single-injection, 6 bilateral single-injection, 4 continuous, and one bilateral continuous block) were performed. A mean initial dose of 0. 25 mL. kg(- 1) of ropivacaine 0. 375 % was injected. A successful block was obtained in all children. Excellent postoperative pain relief was obtained. All parents were satisfied with the postoperative pain relief. No complications occurred. Conclusion: Ultrasonography is useful in the identification of the sciatic nerve and it facilitates needle and catheter placement for proximal and distal nerve blocks in children.

40|$|Introduction: Approaches for <b>proximal</b> <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> {{decompression}} use a transgluteal route, but {{are associated}} with morbidity and complications. An alternative anterior approach to the sciatic nerve was designed. Methods: Five adult human cadavers (10 sides) were used. In the supine position and with lower limbs abducted, an incision was made 3 -cm inferolateral to the pubic tubercle of each specimen. With blunt dissection, a muscle-splitting approach through the obturator foramen was performed through the underlying adductor muscles and deeper obturator muscles that traversed the obturator foramen. Within the pelvis, a laparoscope was inserted in the surgical corridor, which was extraperitoneal. The obturator neurovascular bundle was identified medially and followed posterolaterally toward the greater sciatic foramen. The sciatic nerve was identified. The piriformis muscle was identified as it exited the greater sciatic foramen. Microscissors were inserted and under visualization with the laparoscope, the piriformis muscle was transected near the spine. Results: The piriformis was well visualized and transected. The muscle was best visualized inferolateral to the sciatic nerve. No gross damage to the sciatic nerve or surrounding neurovascular structures occurred. Mean distance from the superomedial edge of the obturator foramen to the ischial spine was 7. 2  cm for left sides and 7. 3  cm for right sides. Conclusions: Use of a laparoscope to approach the piriformis muscle from an anterior intrapelvic, extraperitoneal approach via the obturator foramen is feasible. Clinical use of this method is in order to demonstrate use in patients with suspected compression of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle...|$|E
40|$|Background: The <b>Sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> is {{the widest}} nerve of the body. It {{consists}} of two components, namely: the tibia and the common peroneal components derived from the ventral rami of L 4 to S 3 spinal nerves of the lumbosacral plexus. It exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen below the Piriformis muscle and descends between the greater trochanter of the femur and ischial tuberosity of the pelvis to the knee. The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify the course and variations in branching pattern of the <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> which may lead to various clinical manifestations. Methods: Twenty-eight formalin fixed cadavers comprising of 56 lower limbs are used for this study, of which six specimens were female cadavers. Dissection of gluteal region and posterior compartment of the thigh was done to expose the <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve.</b> Variations in the <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> anatomy; their relationship to Piriformis muscle and a point of bifurcation and trifurcation were noted and recorded. Results: Forty-two lower limbs (75 %) showed normal anatomy of <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve.</b> Fourteen regions (25 %) showed vari-ations in the <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve,</b> of which six regions (11 %) showed a variation of the <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> in relation to Piriformis muscle, three regions (5 %) showed trifurcation of the <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> and five regions (9 %) showed variation in the origin of the sural nerve. Conclusion: The knowledge regarding the level of division and distribution of the <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> and its location is of great importance. The <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> is frequently involved in daily medical practice of neurology, orthopedics, reha-bilitation and anesthesia. Its long course makes it vulnerable to nerve injury.

40|$|High-resolution {{ultrasound}} (US) is {{a helpful}} technique {{for the evaluation}} of peripheral nerves. It is now well accepted that especially in nerve mononeuropaties the combination of morphological data, obtained through US, and functional data, obtained through electrophysiology, is the appropriate way to reach the best diagnosis including information for therapeutical decision. Literature data show that US may crucially influence diagnosis and clinical care in nerve tumors [1, 2]. However, nerve US has some limitations. In particular the visualization of deep nerves is difficult, especially in overweight people. This is the case of <b>proximal</b> part of <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> that is commonly detectable only distal to the gluteal fold. We report on a 48 -year-old woman complaining of pain and electric shocks radiated to sciatic course and trigger point in the right gluteal region. Clinical examination showed only mild right extensor hallucis longus weakness. Needle electromyography of tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, peroneus longus was normal and mild chronic neurogenic recruitment was observed in extensor hallucis longus. It was suspected a right L 5 radiculopathy but magnetic resonance (MR) showed only a mild L 5 –S 1 bulging that was not considered the cause of symptoms. US of <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> was then performed although the trigger point was in a region where usually <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> is not detectable, proximally to the gluteal fold. US was performed using a linear 6 – 10 and 10 – 18 MHz transducer and <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> was bilaterally evaluated in distal–proximal direction starting from the popliteal fossa. Right <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> was detectable along all its course, even proximally to the gluteal fold although with no optimal visualization. At the middle-third of the gluteus a fusiform hypoechoic increase of nerve volume was found. The maximum longitudinal diameter was 2. 5 cm and maximum antero-posterior diameter was 2. 0 cm (max cross-sectional area 4. 5 cm 2). An accurate evaluation of the US video clip suggested that the mass raised from lateral fascicles sparing and dislocating remaining medial fascicles (Fig. 1 a, b). US and clinical data suggested a <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> tumor, likely a schwannoma. MR confirmed the lesion showing a partially preserved fascicular structure, suggesting a schwannoma (Fig. 1 c–f). Surgical excision was refused by the patient and US monitoring planned. Our case report confirms the usefulness of US in the diagnosis of nerve tumors. US is not able to clearly differentiate the type of nerve tumor but can provide useful information to discriminate between the two main types, schwannoma or neurofibroma [3 – 5]. Schwannoma typically displaces the nerve fascicles and generally is positioned eccentrically to the affected nerve segment. Another typical feature especially of large lesions is the presence of hyperechoic calcifications and internal degenerative cystic foci. On the other side neurofibroma presents as a concentric lesion that does not displace the fascicular elements of the nerve but interferes with them (usually fascicles are not detectable). Another typical sonographic feature of this kind of tumor is the so-called ‘‘target sign’’ (layered aspect, with a hyperechoic centre and a peripheral hypoechoic rim, best seen on transverse scans) [6].

40|$|Objective(s) : To {{investigate}} the systemic and local immune status of two surgical rat models of <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> injury, a crushed <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve,</b> and a <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> transection Materials and Methods:Twenty-four adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly {{divided into three}} groups: sham-operation (control group), <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> crush, and <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> transaction. <b>Sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> surgery was performed. The percentage of CD 4 + cells and the CD 4 +/CD 8 +ratio were determined by flow cytometry. Serum IgM and IgG levels were analyzed by ELISA. T-cells (CD 3) and macrophages (CD 68) in <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> tissue sections were identified through immunohistochemistry. Results: Compared to sham-operated controls, in rats that underwent nerve injury, the percentage of CD 4 + cells and the CD 4 +/CD 8 + ratio in the peripheral blood were significantly  decreased 7 days after surgery, serum IgM levels were increased 14 days after surgery, and serum IgG levels were increased 21 days after surgery. There were {{a large number of}} CD 3 + cells and a small number of CD 68 + cells in <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> tissue sections 21 days after surgery, indicating T-cell and macrophage activation and infiltration. Local IgG deposition was also detected at the nerve injury site 21 days after surgery.

40|$|Abstract Background & aim: Peripheral nerve {{injuries}} {{which can}} lead to a physical disability. If the defect is very low, direct suture without tension on both ends of the cut nerve regeneration is considered as a standard procedure. Otherwise, to reconstruct the axons, the gap must be filled by graft material in order to the guidance. Due to the similarity of the matrix tubular skeletal muscle and nerve muscles graft was used to repair in this study. Methods: In the present experimental study, 42 female Wistar rats were divided into three groups and underwent surgery. In the first group a narrow strip of muscle was prepared by freezing – thawing, and later sutured between the distal and <b>proximal</b> <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve.</b> In the second group, the gap caused by muscle graft was regenerated and the nerve growth factor and laminin was injected into the graft. In the control group, the two ends of the cut nerve were hidden beneath the adjacent muscles. Next, a group of rats with sciatic functional index was investigated for the behavioral. On the other group were examined for histological studies after two months. Results: Sciatic functional index and Mean counts of myelinated fibers in two graft groups compared with the control group was significant) p< 0. 05). Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA test. Conclusion: co-axially aligned muscle grafts were an appropriate alternative substitute for repairing. It seems that the nerve growth factor and laminin have a positive role in axonal regeneration and functional recovery acceleration.

40|$|Axons, and {{particularly}} regenerating axons, have high metabolic needs {{in order to}} maintain critical functions such as axon transport and membrane depolarization. Though some of the required energy likely comes form extracellular glucose and ATP generated in the soma, we and others hypothesize that some of the energy may be supplied by lactate. Unlike glucose that requires glycolytic enzymes to produce pyruvate, lactate can be converted directly to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase and transported into mitochondria for oxidative metabolism. In order to be transported into or out of cells, lactate requires specific monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), the most abundant of which is MCT 1. If MCT 1 and lactate are critical for nerve function and regeneration, we hypothesize that MCT 1 heterozygote null mice, which appear phenotypically normal despite having approximately 40 % MCT 1 as compared to wildtype littermate mice, would have reduced capacity for repair following nerve injury. To investigate this, adult MCT 1 heterozygote null mice or wild-type mice underwent unilateral sciatic nerve crush in the proximal thigh. We found that regeneration of the sciatic nerve, as measured by recovery of compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) in the lateral plantar muscles following <b>proximal</b> <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> stimulation, was delayed from a median of 21 days in wildtype mice to 38. 5 days in MCT 1 heterozygote mice. In fact, half of the MCT 1 heterozygote null mice had no recovery of CMAP by the endpoint of the study at 42 days, while all of the wild-type mice had recovered. In addition, the maximal amplitude of CMAP recovery in MCT 1 heterozygote mull mice was reduced from a mean of 3 mV to 0. 5 mV. As would be expected, the denervated gastrocnemius muscle of MCT 1 heterozygote null mice remained atrophic at 42 days compared to wild-type mice. Our experiments show that lactate supplied through MCT 1 is necessary for nerve regeneration. Experiments are underway to determine whether loss of MCT 1 prevents nerve regrowth directly due to reduced energy supply to axons or indirectly by dysfunctional Schwann cells normally dependent on lactate supply through MCT 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} acetyl-L-carnitine on some {{degenerative}} and regenerative phenomena following sciatic nerve transection in rats, were studied. In Experiment 1, acetyl-L-carnitine was administered intraperitoneally at the dose of 50 mg/kg/day for 28 and 56 days following transection and microsurgical repair of the sciatic nerve. On day 56, the acetyl-L-carnitine-treated rats showed a significantly (p less than 0. 05) better motor recovery ("clinical assessment") of the peroneal {{component of the}} sciatic nerve than the control rats. Twenty-eight days after nerve repair, the acetyl-L-carnitine-treated rats showed a significantly higher (p less than 0. 05) number of myelinated axons in the postlesional nerve stump than control rats. Finally, the treated rats had a significantly lower (p less than 0. 05) presence of atrophic fibres in the extensor digitorum longus muscle. In Experiment 2 the sciatic nerve was cut. To prevent spontaneous regeneration, a metallic clip {{was applied to the}} distal nerve stump and then the nerve stumps were positioned in different anatomical compartments. After surgery, a group of rats was treated with acetyl-L-carnitine dissolved in the drinking water (75 mg/kg/day). Another group of rats received normal water and served as the control group. Three, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months postoperatively, in the rats of both groups, the <b>proximal</b> <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> stump was injected with horseradish peroxidase to label the spinal cord neurons of the sciatic nerve nucleus. While in untreated rats the number of horseradish peroxidase-labelled neurons decreased with the increase in denervation time, in acetyl-L-carnitine-treated rats the number of horseradish peroxidase-labelled neurons remained stable for as long as 12 months of denervation and decreased only after 18 months of denervation. Furthermore, acetyl-L-carnitine-treated rats showed a significantly higher (p less than 0. 05) number of horseradish peroxidase-labelled neurons with respect to untreated rats both after 9 and 12 months of denervation. In Experiment 3, the sciatic nerve was cut and then repaired after periods of 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months. Four months after nerve repair, the sciatic nerve was again cut and the proximal nerve stump was injected with horseradish peroxidase to label the spinal cord neurons of the sciatic nerve nucleus. Both acetyl-L-carnitine-treated and untreated rats showed a tendency to have an increased number of horseradish peroxidase-labelled neurons with respect to intact rats of correspondent ages.

ObjectivesTo confirm that the <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> can be identified on ultrasonography in patients with venous disease as well as in normal subjects. MethodThirty unselected patients (60 limbs) attending for outpatient consultations were investigated by duplex ultrasound examination of the popliteal fossa.

40|$|Objectives: Research has {{established}} {{that the amount of}} inherent tension a peripheral nerve tract is exposed to influences nerve excursion and joint range of movement (ROM). The effect that spinal posture has on <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> excursion during neural mobilisation exercises has yet to be determined. The purpose of this research was to examine the influence of different sitting positions (slump-sitting versus upright-sitting) on the amount of longitudinal <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> movement during different neural mobilisation exercises commonly used in clinical practice. Methods: High-resolution ultrasound imaging followed by frame-by-frame cross-correlation analysis was used to assess <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> excursion. Thirty-four healthy participants each performed three different neural mobilisation exercises in slump-sitting and upright-sitting. Means comparisons were used to examine the influence of sitting position on <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> excursion for the three mobilisation exercises. Linear regression analysis was used to determine whether any of the demographic data represented predictive variables for longitudinal <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> excursion. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> excursion (across all neural mobilisation exercises) observed between upright-sitting and slump-sitting positions (P[*]=[*] 0. 26). Although greater body mass index, greater knee ROM and younger age were associated with higher levels of <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> excursion, this model of variables offered weak predictability (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 22). Discussion: Following this study, there is no evidence that, in healthy people, longitudinal <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> excursion differs significantly with regards to the spinal posture (slump-sitting and upright-sitting). Furthermore, although some demographic variables are weak predictors, the high variance suggests that there are other unknown variables that may predict <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> excursion. It can be inferred from this research that clinicians can individualise the design of seated neural mobilisation exercises, using different seated positions, based upon patient comfort and minimisation of neural mechanosensitivity with the knowledge that <b>sciatic</b> <b>nerve</b> excursion will not be significantly influenced...|$|R
