40|$|A hybrid vortex {{filament}} scheme {{with the}} capability of simulating bounded turbulent flows is described. Viscous generation of new vortex elements at solid surfaces is accom-plished through the intermediary of solving the viscous vorticity transport equation on a thin boundary mesh via a finite difference and finite volume method. The transitional and turbulent boundary layer flow past a wide, finite thickness, flat <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> is computed <b>with</b> a view toward validating the methodology and gaining new insight into the structural aspects of transition. The predicted mean velocity and related statistics are well matched to experimental and numerical data. The representation of transitional flow through vortex filaments is shown to suggest a need for reinterpreting the meaning {{of some of its}} basic structural features. In particular, the motions commonly attributed to the presence in the flow of discrete self-contained vortical structures may in some instances be more precisely described as representing differing aspects of the transitional vortex sheet covering the wall region...|$|R

The goal of the present computational study is to validate the MLC design using Monte Carlo (MC) modeling. The study {{was based on the}} Kirloskar-supplied Phoenix model machines that closely match the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) theratron- 80 machine. The MLC is a retrofit attachment to the collimator assembly, with 14 non-divergent leaf pairs of 40 mm thick, 7 mm wide, and 150 mm long tungsten alloy <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> and 20 mm tongue and 2 mm groove in each leaf. In the present work, the source and collimator geometry has been investigated in detail to arrive at a model that best represents the measured dosimetric data. The authors have studied in detail the proto-I MLC built for cobalt- 60. The MLC field sizes were MC simulated for 2 × 2 cm 2 to 14 × 14 cm 2 square fields as well as irregular fields, and the percent depth dose (PDD) and profile data were compared with ROPS† treatment planning system (TPS). In addition, measured profiles using the IMATRIXX system‡ were also compared with the MC simulations. The proto-I MLC can define radiation fields up to 14 × 14 cm΂ within 3 mm accuracy. The maximum measured leakage through the leaf ends in closed condition was 3. 4 % and interleaf leakage observed was 7. 3 %. Good agreement between MC results, ROPS and IMATRIXX results has been observed. The investigation also supports the hypothesis that optical and radiation field coincidence exists for the square fields studied with the MLC. Plots of the percent depth dose (PDD) data and profile data for clinically significant irregular fields have also been presented. The MC model was also investigated to speed up the calculations to allow calculations of clinically relevant conformal beams...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Large {{amplitude}} {{free vibration}} analyses of thin-to-moderately thick angle-ply laminated rectangular <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> <b>edges</b> rotationally restrained against rotation are investigated using the differential quadrature method (DQM). The governing equations {{are based on}} two different theories: thin or classical plate theory and the first order shear deformation plate theory. In both theories, Green’s strain {{in conjunction with the}} von Karman assumption is employed. The boundary conditions are implemented precisely at boundary grid points and are built into the equations of motion without any extra efforts. After transforming the governing equations from temporal to frequency domain, a direct iterative method is used to solve the nonlinear eigenvalue system of equations. The convergence of the method is shown and its accuracy is demonstrated by comparing the results with those for limit cases, i. e., laminated <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> classical boundary conditions and also for linear free vibration analysis of laminated <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> restrained <b>edges.</b> Finally, the effects of different parameters on the ratio of nonlinear to linear natural frequency of plates are studied.

Center deflections, membrane stresses, and extreme-fiber bending stresses are given {{as a function of}} pressure for center deflections up to twice the thickness of the plate. For small deflections the results coincide with those obtained by Hencky from the linear theory. The maximum stresses and center deflection at high pressures differ less than 3 percent from those derived by Bostnov for an infinitely long <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> clamped <b>edges.</b> This agreement suggests that clamped <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> a length-to-width ratio greater than 1. 5 may be reared as infinitely long plates for purposes of design...|$|R

These equations are coded in terms of deflection of the plate and the mentioned functions. By solving these decoupled equations, the analytic solutions of rectangular thick <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> all <b>edges</b> clamped and supported have been derived.
