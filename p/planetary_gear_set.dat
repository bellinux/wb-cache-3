5000|$|A {{variant of}} the THM400 known as a THM375 is a THM400 with a long output shaft that mates to the smaller THM350 drive shaft yoke. It can be {{identified}} by [...] "375-THM" [...] cast into the tailhousing. Internally the clutch packs originally had fewer friction plates. THM375s were found in some 1971-76 Buicks. Some [...] "Heavy Duty" [...] THM350s were also designated THM375-B. Another variant is the 3L80HD, {{often referred to as}} a Turbo 475.

50|$|The Torsen T3 centre {{differential}} {{combines a}} <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>set</b> with a Torsen differential in a compact package developed for centre differential installations. Unlike the T2 Torsen where the torque split is a nominal 50:50, in the T3 Torsen the torque split, {{due to the}} use of the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>set,</b> is an actual asymmetric 40:60 front-rear torque split (i.e., when grip is equal on both front and rear axles, 40% of torque is sent to the front axle, and 60% to the rear). As with the T1 Torsen, torque will be distributed dynamically depending on tractive conditions, but with an actual (rather than nominal) static bias. The T3 allows handling characteristics and vehicle dynamics more akin to rear-wheel drive cars. This asymmetric Torsen was first introduced in the highly acclaimed 2006-model (B7) Audi RS4. The Type 3 torsen was used in the Audi S4 and RS4 B7 manual transmissions from 2006 to 2008, as well as the S6, S8, and Q7 models from 2007.|$|E

For improving load sharing among planet wings, the application of flexible planetary pins or using free central wheel is needed. Presented paper is oriented on mathematical model design. The plane type of gearings with four planetary subsystems and fixed planet carrier has been selected.

5000|$|Ravigneaux-type {{planetary}} gear ({{planetary gear}} with 4 shafts instead of 3) and two clutches {{as used in}} the Lexus GS450h. By switching the clutches, the gear ratio from MG2 (the traction motor) to the wheel shaft is switched, either for higher torque or higher speed (up to 250 km/h / 155 mph) while sustaining better transmission efficiency. This is effectively accomplished in the Generation 3 Prius HSDs (Prius v, Prius Plug-in and Prius c), although the Generation 3 HSD has this second <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>set</b> fixed at 2.5:1, rather than switching between 1:1 and 2.5:1 as the [...] "carrier" [...] is held fixed.|$|E

50|$|In Generation 1 and Generation 2 HSDs, MG2 is {{directly}} connected to the ring gear, that is, a 1:1 ratio, and which offers no torque multiplication, whereas in Generation 3 HSDs, MG2 {{is connected to the}} ring gear through a 2.5:1 <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>set,</b> and which, consequently, offers a 2.5:1 torque multiplication, this being a primary benefit of the Generation 3 HSD as it provides for a smaller, yet more powerful MG2.

The transaxle is bolted to torque transfer unit that spins a center drive shaft that powers the rear differential unit. The rear differential is a T-shaped device.

5000|$|In 1953, Buick {{redesigned}} the Dynaflow, {{calling it}} the [...] "Twin Turbine Dynaflow". The converter now incorporated two turbines and a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>set,</b> with a single stator.

This resulted in better efficiency, especially at highway speeds, and a higher level of performance and no penalty regarding the trademark smoothness. Buick also incorporated a variable-pitch stator in 1955 for greater flexibility. While these changes improved the transmission's overall performance and efficiency, the Dynaflow still was no match for other designs that utilized three element converters with automatic shifting.|$|E

50|$|Selec-Trac II uses a console mounted {{switch to}} control the MP3022 {{transfer}} case. The switch controls the 4WD mode with options of 2WD - 4WD Auto - N - 4WD Low. The MP3022 transfer case uses an electronically controlled clutch pack to bias torque from 100% rear to 50/50% front/rear. The transfer case has no center differential, so power can only be supplied to the front axle when the rear wheels begin to slip. In this way, the transfer case works almost identically to the NV247 transfer case used in the Quadra-Trac II system in 1999 to 2004 WJ Jeep Grand Cherokees. In 4WD Low mode, the clutch pack is locked and power flows through a 2.72:1 <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>set</b> for higher torque at lower speeds.|$|E

The high torque and the low wheel speed typical of such machines result in poor lubrication and promote the onset of contact fatigue failure by pitting, which generally occurs earlier in the sun gear than in both the planets and the ring of wheel hub planetary drives. In fact, sun gears are subjected to the highest contact pressure and, at the same time, unfavourable rolling-sliding working conditions.

The objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate the <b>planetary</b> <b>gears</b> vibration properties in healthy and faulty conditions. To seek this goal a previously proposed lumped parameter model (LPM) of <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> trains is integrated with a more comprehensive bearing model.

The proposed model is completely general and accepts any inner/outer race bearing defect location and profile in addition to its original capacity of modelling cracks and spalls of gears; therefore, various combinations of gears and bearing defects are also applicable. The model is exploited to attain the dynamic response of the system in order to identify and analyze localized faults signatures for inner and outer races as well as rolling elements of planets bearings. Moreover, bearing defect frequen- cies of inner/outer race and ball/roller and also their sidebands are discussed thoroughly.
