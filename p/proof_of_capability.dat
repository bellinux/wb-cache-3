40|$|In {{this thesis}} the Therapeutical Risk Index (TRI) is {{proposed}} as {{an approach to}} the risk assessment of image-guided minimally invasive surgery. The risk {{is defined as the}} probability of damaging sensitive structures. Such an assessment of the patient’s risk is inevitable if minimally invasive surgery is expanded to the medical fields e. g. otolaryngology, in which it causes a need for new highly innovative surgical techniques. These innovative techniques imply that several manipulation canals must be drilled into the otobasis in order to reach structures at the inner ear (Figure 1). One challenge connected with this are closely spaced collision structures (e. g. the facial nerve and carotid artery) in this area. Even small deviations of the manipulation canals from the image-based presurgical planning can damage relevant collision structures. It is only ethically justifiable if this knowledge can be used in the decision making process for or against such a surgical intervention. The proposed approach to risk assessment is based on principles from metrology and production engineering which has several advantages: One aspect {{is that there is a}} common understanding in metrology regarding terms like accuracy, uncertainty and precision as they are defined in the international vocabulary of metrology. Another aspect is the existence of several standardized approaches to the estimation of uncertainty and to the <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>capability</b> in the field of metrology. The approaches to the estimation of uncertainties and process capabilities are transferred to the medical domain and form the basis for the definition of the TRI. First relevant factors that influence the process chain are identified: imaging with image processing and the navigation of the surgical instrument. Both factors are uncertain (uimag and unav) to some degree which can cause the unintentional damage of sensitive structures. These uncertainties are quantified for one example. To estimate the individual patient’s risk and to validate the proposed risk index TRI the CT data from 10 real patients are used and the index TRI is calculated individually for each patient. It is evident that the TRI is a suitable index for the risk assessment of image-guided minimally invasive surgery through the comparison of this index with the calculated risk of damaging sensitive structures with a mathematical model...|$|E

40|$|A new {{numerical}} code PB 3 D (Peeling-Ballooning in 3 -D) is presented. It implements and solves the intermediate-to-high-n ideal linear magnetohydrodynamic stability theory extended to full edge 3 -D magnetic toroidal configurations in previous work [1]. The features that make PB 3 D unique are the assumptions on the perturbation structure through intermediate-to-high mode numbers n in general 3 -D configurations, while allowing for {{displacement of the}} plasma edge. This makes PB 3 D capable of very efficient calculations of the full 3 -D stability for the output of multiple equilibrium codes. As first verification, it is checked that results from the stability code MISHKA [2], which considers axisymmetric equilibrium configurations, are accurately reproduced, and these are then successfully extended to 3 -D configurations, through comparison with COBRA [3], as well as using checks on physical consistency. The non-intuitive 3 -D results presented serve as a tentative first <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>capabilities</b> <b>of</b> the code...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a novel {{approach}} to anatomy knowledge representation is described. The focus of the present research {{has been on the}} development of a representational framework where the conceptual level has been implemented by using hierarchical and nonhierarchical conceptual networks. This has allowed handling the demand for multiple views of anatomy (systemic and topographical views). The terminological level of the knowledge representation has been implemented by using a compositional strategy which has avoided the explicit storage of the terms used to express composite concepts. Hierarchical relations and composite concept representations have required supervision of both the inheritance and concept reconstruction. For this purpose heuristic knowledge has been stored in terms of consistency rules in the knowledge base.

40|$|Advancement in astronomical {{observations}} and technical instrumentation requires coding light propagation at {{high level of}} precision; this could open a new detection window of many subtle relativistic effects suffered by light while it is propagating and entangled in the physical measurements. Light propagation and its subsequent detection should indeed be conceived in a fully relativistic context, in order {{to interpret the results}} of the observations in accordance with the geometrical environment affecting light propagation itself, as an unicum surrounding universe.
