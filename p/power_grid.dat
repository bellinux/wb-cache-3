5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E

30|$|<b>Power</b> <b>grids</b> are {{amongst the}} largest and the most complex {{man-made}} systems and, like many other complex networks, it features a specific topology which characterizes its connectivity and influences the dynamics of processes executed on the network. The complex nature of <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> and its underlying structure {{make it possible to}} analyse <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> relying on network science (Strogatz 2001; Barabási and Albert 1999). The application of network science on <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> has shown the promising potential to capture the interdependencies between components and to understand the collective emergent behaviour of complex <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> (Crucitti et al. 2004; Chassin and Posse 2005).|$|R

5|$|The State Grid Corporation and China Southern <b>Power</b> <b>Grid</b> paid a {{flat rate}} of ¥250per MWh (US$35.7) until July 2, 2008. Since then, the price has varied by province, from ¥228.7–401.8per MWh. Higher-paying {{customers}} receive priority, such as Shanghai. Nine provinces and two cities consume {{power from the}} dam.|$|E
5|$|After {{the power}} outage was over, Hydro-Québec made {{numerous}} upgrades to its system {{in order to}} improve the <b>power</b> <b>grid.</b> Examples include the strengthening of electrical pylons and power poles, and increasing the power supply. This was done to enable the utility to restore power more rapidly {{in the case of a}} massive ice striking Quebec again. Hydro-Québec has stated that it is better-prepared to handle an ice storm with the same magnitude as the one of 1998.|$|E
30|$|In current practice, flow-based {{simulations}} play {{an essential}} role in the security analysis of <b>power</b> <b>grids.</b> Given the generation and demand profiles, the steady-state analyses estimate the operation of <b>power</b> <b>grids.</b> Additionally, many countries require that the <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> should withstand the scheduled and unscheduled outages of its most critical lines or other components. In these contingency analyses, the component outages are also simulated to determine whether the <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> can still function properly under the failure and consequent loss of an element. However, as <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> grow in size and get more complex, the number of contingencies increases significantly, increasing the associated computational time. This motivates research towards alternative techniques (Bompard et al. 2009; Gutierrez et al. 2013; Hines et al. 2010 a).|$|R
40|$|Direct energy {{methods have}} been {{extensively}} developed for the transient stability analysis and contingency screening of <b>power</b> <b>grids.</b> However, there is no analytical energy functions proposed for <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> with losses, which are normal in practice. This paper applies the recently introduced Lyapunov Functions Family approach to the certification of synchronization stability for lossy <b>power</b> <b>grids.</b> This technique does not rely on the global decreasing of the Lyapunov function as in the direct energy methods, and thus is possible {{to deal with the}} lossy <b>power</b> <b>grids.</b> We show that this approach is also applicable to uncertain <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> where the stable equilibrium is unknown due to possible uncertainties in system parameters. We formulate this new control problem and introduce techniques to certify the robust stability of a given initial state with respect to a set of equilibria...|$|R
30|$|Motivated by the {{increasing}} need of alternative studies to the flow-based analyses and {{the merits of}} network science on the investigation of <b>power</b> <b>grids,</b> in this paper, we combine both of the aforementioned approaches: First, we present two different graph representations for a power grid: a simple graph and an extended graph representation that takes the electrical properties of <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> into account. Next, we develop a methodology to identify the critical electrical buses (nodes) in <b>power</b> <b>grids,</b> and compare the impact of targeted node-attacks in detail for European high-voltage transmission networks (Cetinay 2018) and for the publicly available IEEE test <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> (IEEE 2018). Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (i) we consider two different graph models for <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> based on either purely topological information or by including the link weight information and the linearised DC power flow equations; (ii) we employ these two graph models to formulate the standard and the extended centrality metrics of nodes in power grids; (iii) we formulate 8 different attack scenarios according to these centrality metrics and empirically investigate the impact of targeted node-attacks on the structural and operational performance of <b>power</b> <b>grids.</b>|$|R
5|$|Emergency {{management}} {{officials in}} Fredericton {{stated that it}} could be years before the city fully recovered from the storm. Power restoration in the province reached over 99 percent on July16 with only 750customers still out. However, a thunderstorm that evening revealed the weak nature of the <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> as outages jumped back over 4,000. The following week, Energy Minister Craig Leonard rebutted claims that a public review of NB Power was necessary, despite the longevity and severity of the power outages. New Brunswick's Liberal and Green parties both supported an independent review of the company, while Leonard claimed only an internal review was necessary. The total cost to restore and repair damage to the <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> wrought by the storm amounted to C$8.4million (US$7.5million). This ranked it as the second-costliest event for Nova Scotia Power from a tropical cyclone, only behind Hurricane Juan. New Brunswick Power reported even greater losses from Arthur with damage amounting to C$23million (US$20.1million). This marked the costliest disaster in the company's history, surpassing the December 2013 ice storm. In light of the severe damage, NB Power allocated an extra C$5.1million (US$4.5million) for tree trimming during the 2014-2014 fiscal year.|$|E

The ±450kV high-voltage direct current line in Hydro-Québec's <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> uses a T-shaped tower, lattice or pole, to support two bundles of three conductors on each side.

30|$|Transient {{stability}} of the <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> is a keen area of research because of its implications in the power system planning, operation and control. Energy based methods for the transient analysis of <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> were developed originally by Mangnusson [1] and Aylett [2]. The substantial size of <b>power</b> <b>grids</b> makes the transient analysis computationally costly to simulate and therefore a need of model order reduction arises. Reduced order models need to be computationally cost-effective while retaining considerable accuracy of the full model in large network grids simulations.|$|R

5|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles offer users {{the opportunity to}} sell electricity stored in their batteries back to the <b>power</b> <b>grid,</b> thereby helping utilities to operate more efficiently {{in the management of}} their demand peaks. A vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system would take advantage of the fact that most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time. During such idle times the electricity stored in the batteries could be transferred from the PEV to the power lines and back to the grid. In the U.S this transfer back to the grid have an estimated value to the utilities of up to $4,000 per year per car. In a V2G system it would also be expected that battery electric (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would have the capability to communicate automatically with the <b>power</b> <b>grid</b> to sell demand response services by either delivering electricity into the grid or by throttling their charging rate.|$|E
