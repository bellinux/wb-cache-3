25|$|The Canary Islands {{have low}} levels of air {{pollution}} thanks {{to the lack of}} factories and industry and the tradewinds which naturally move away contaminated air from the islands. According to official data offered by the Health and Industry Ministry in Spain, Tenerife is one of the cleanest places in the country with an air <b>pollution</b> <b>index</b> below the national average. Despite this, there are still agents which affect pollution levels in the island, the main polluting agents being the refinery at Santa Cruz, the thermal power plants at Las Caletillas and Granadilla, and road traffic, increased by the high level of tourism in the island. In addition on the island of Tenerife like on La Palma light pollution must be also controlled, to help the astrophysical observatories located in the island's summits.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol {{combustion}} in {{an internal}} combustion engine yields many of the products of incomplete combustion produced by gasoline and significantly larger amounts of formaldehyde and related species such as acetaldehyde. This leads to a significantly larger photochemical reactivity and more ground level ozone. These data have been assembled into The Clean Fuels Report comparison of fuel emissions and show that ethanol exhaust generates 2.14times as much ozone as gasoline exhaust. When this is added into the custom Localised <b>Pollution</b> <b>Index</b> (LPI) of The Clean Fuels Report, the local pollution of ethanol (pollution that contributes to smog) is rated 1.7, where gasoline is 1.0 and higher numbers signify greater pollution. The California Air Resources Board formalized this issue in 2008 by recognizing control standards for formaldehydes as an emissions control group, much like the conventional NOx and Reactive Organic Gases (ROGs).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{ecosystem}} of Fuhe River, {{which is}} the main inflow tributary of Baiyangdian Lake, {{is crucial to the}} ecological health and environmental safety of the lake. Understanding the variation of Fuhe River ecosystem and taking measures to reduce its pollutants can help relieve the eutrophication of Baiyangdian Lake. To investigate this, we monitored water quality and levels of nitrogen removal bacteria along the Fuhe River using comprehensive <b>pollution</b> <b>indices</b> and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Samples were collected in the low-flow, high-flow and mean-water periods of 2009 and 2010. The dissolved oxygen (DO) values were, on an average, lower than 4 mg/L suggesting that the river was in low oxygen conditions, mainly conducting anaerobic reactions. The chemical oxygen demand (CODCr) values decreased gradually along the river, with the highest value of 128. 65 mg/L at the first sampling site. The concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) increased to 56. 21 mg/L and 4. 96 mg/L respectively, with concentrations at the inlet of the wetland significantly higher than those in the lake. The comprehensive <b>pollution</b> <b>indexes</b> reached the highest in the low-flow period in 2009 and in 2010, up to 78. 81 and 77. 10, respectively. Overall, the high comprehensive <b>pollution</b> <b>indices</b> for TN and TP indicated that the Fuhe River was polluted by N and P nutrients. There were abundant denitrifying bacteria and anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria at the terrestrial-aquatic interface of the upstream region of the river according to the Shannon-Weiner index...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEight {{heavy metals}} were {{measured}} seasonally in the sediment of Lake Nasser during 2013. 27 sites were chosen through 9 sectors across the main channel {{of the lake}} from Abu-Simbel to Aswan High Dam to assess the levels of the selected metals. The abundance of these metals was {{in the order of}} Fe>Mn>Zn>Cr>Ni>Cu>Pb>Cd, with mean concentrations of 12. 41 mg/g, 279. 56, 35. 38, 30. 79, 27. 56, 21. 78, 11. 21 and 0. 183 Œºg/g, respectively. Heavy metals are positively correlated with fine particles (mud fractions) and organic matter accumulation. The results showed perspicuous spatial high significant differences (P< 0. 01) for all the measured metals. Fe, Cr, Ni, Pb and Cd exhibited temporally high significant differences (P< 0. 01) before and after the flood period. Four <b>Pollution</b> <b>Indices</b> were used for the environmental assessment of Lake Nasser sediment.

The research results indicated that temperature was an important factor influencing the removal rates of the main <b>pollution</b> <b>indexes.</b> When temperature was {{in the range of}} 5 ¬∞C- 8 ¬∞C, the promotion effects of enzyme on the removals of CODCr and ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N) of sewage by biofilm process were not obvious. However when temperature were in the ranges of 15 ¬∞C- 18 ¬∞C and 22 ¬∞C- 25 ¬∞C, enzyme had the high promotion effects on the removals of the <b>pollution</b> <b>indexes.</b> Furthermore, within the certain temperature (5 ¬∞C- 25 ¬∞C), the removal rates of CODCr and NH 3 -N were on the rise with the increase of temperature. When temperature increased from 5 ¬∞C- 8 ¬∞C to 15 ¬∞C- 18 ¬∞C, the removal rate of CODCr obviously increased, but when temperature continued to increase to 25, the rise trend of the removal rate of CODCr became slow. On the other hand, when temperature increased from 5 ¬∞C- 8 ¬∞C to 22 ¬∞C- 25 ¬∞C, the increase of the removal rate of NH 3 -N was always evident. Therefore, the optimal temperature was in the range of 22 ¬∞C- 25 ¬∞C for the enhanced treatment of sewage from discharging points of rivers by biofilm process dosing with enzyme...|$|R
