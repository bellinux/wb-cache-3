50|$|Once {{the design}} of the product’s {{components}} is complete, the method of manufacturing is defined. This includes CAD tasks such as tool design; including creation of CNC Machining instructions for the product’s parts as well as creation of specific tools to manufacture those parts, using integrated or separate CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) software. This will also involve analysis tools for process simulation of operations such as casting, molding, and die-press forming.Once the manufacturing method has been identified CPM comes into play. This involves CAPE (Computer Aided Production Engineering) or CAP/CAPP (Computer Aided production planning) tools for carrying out factory, plant and facility layout and production simulation e.g. press-line simulation, industrial ergonomics, as well as tool selection management.Once components are manufactured, their geometrical form and size can be checked against the original CAD data with the use of computer-aided inspection equipment and software.Parallel to the engineering tasks, sales product configuration and marketing documentation work take place. This could include transferring engineering data (geometry and <b>part</b> <b>list</b> data) to a web based sales configurator and other desktop publishing systems.|$|E

40|$|Push-based MRP and pull-based Kanban {{systems are}} {{effective}} production control policies {{for a wide}} range of manufacturing environment. Both of them, however, have certain limitations when they are implemented in different production environments. In recent years, CONWIP (CONstant Work-In-process), a hybrid push/pull control policy, was proposed and studied to take advantages of MRP and Kanban systems for optimal work-in-process (WIP) inventory control. CONWIP is a closed production system in which a constant number of containers traverse a closed loop that includes the entire production system. In order to effectively implement CONWIP control in a manufacturing environment, several issues, such as the number of containers, lot sizes and job sequence, need to be addressed. This research aims at the development of mathematical models to address these issues and to help implement CONWIP systems in different manufacturing environments. Two mathematical programming models are developed to address issues on a single serial CONWIP line system. The first model can be used in a make-to-stock environment and the objective function of the model is to minimize the setup costs and the costs associated with an unbalanced workload at the bottleneck machine. The solution of the first model simultaneously determines the optimal job sequence on the <b>part</b> <b>list</b> and the lot size associated with each entry on the <b>part</b> <b>list.</b> The second model can be used in a make-to-order environment or in a make-to-stock environment with a known <b>part</b> <b>list.</b> The objective function of the second model is to minimize the system makespan. Two essential CONWIP system parameters, number of containers and job sequence can be determined by solving the second model. A third model is developed for an assembly-type CONWIP system with multiple fabrication lines feeding an assembly station. The objective of the third model is to synchronize system production by minimizing makespan differences among all the fabrication lines. The solution of the third model determines the number of the containers and job sequence for each of the fabrication lines. The solution of such models is NP-hard. The general branch and bound approach used by most off-the-shelf optimization software cannot be used to solve real sized problems of this nature. In order to solve real sized problems efficiently, we develop a heuristic search method based on simulated annealing. Several example problems are used to test the developed models and algorithms. Computational results validate the modelling and computational efficiency of the solution method...|$|E
