500|$|Core intent {{would be}} where the {{defendant}} acted either to cause at least grievous bodily harm to the victim, or where the defendant acted to achieve some other aim, where the death caused was a necessary means to that other end. In general, the jury is directed that [...] "intent" [...] is to be taken as meaning what it does in ordinary life, and that the judge should not attempt to define it in other terms. However, following R v Woollin, {{it is also possible}} for a jury to convict if they [...] "feel sure that death or serious injury was a virtual certainty (barring some unforeseen intervention) {{as a result of the}} defendant's actions and that the defendant appreciated that such was the case" [...] known as [...] "oblique intent". Despite appearing to present an alternative to the <b>primary,</b> <b>core</b> sense of intent, courts have generally seen Woollin as allowing the jury to infer core intent from the evidence of virtual certainty. The jury are entitled to convict in these circumstances, and they should not be directed that they, finding virtual certainty, must convict. However, if it is difficult to imagine circumstances where a jury would find virtual certainty but not convict, which would support this complicating factor. The exception for medical care is mentioned as a general principle for homicide.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} virtual memory was first {{developed}} by German physicist Fritz-Rudolf Güntsch at the Technische Universität Berlin in 1956 in his doctoral thesis, Logical Design of a Digital Computer with Multiple Asynchronous Rotating Drums and Automatic High Speed Memory Operation; it described a machine with 6 100-word blocks of <b>primary</b> <b>core</b> memory and an address space of 1,000 100-word blocks, with hardware automatically moving blocks between primary memory and secondary drum memory.

40|$|We {{study the}} violent {{phase of the}} merger of massive binary white dwarf systems. Our aim is to {{characterize}} the conditions for explosive burning to occur, and identify a possible explosion mechanism of Type Ia supernovae. The primary components of our model systems are carbon-oxygen (C/O) white dwarfs, while the secondaries are made either of C/O or of pure helium. We account for tidal effects in the initial conditions in a self-consistent way, and consider initially well-separated systems with slow inspiral rates. We study the merger evolution using an adaptive mesh refinement, reactive, Eulerian code in three dimensions, assuming symmetry across the orbital plane. We use a co-rotating reference frame to minimize the effects of numerical diffusion, and solve for self-gravity using a multi-grid approach. We find a novel detonation mechanism in C/O mergers with massive primaries. Here the detonation occurs in the <b>primary's</b> <b>core</b> and relies on the combined action of tidal heating, accretion heating, and self-heating due to nuclear burning. The exploding structure is compositionally stratified, with a reverse shock formed at {{the surface of the}} dense ejecta. The existence of such a shock has not been reported elsewhere. The explosion energy (1. 6 × 10 ^ 51 erg) and ^ 56 Ni mass (0. 86 M_) are consistent with a SN Ia at the bright end of the luminosity distribution, with an approximated decline rate of Δ m_ 15 (B) ≈ 0. 99. Our study does not support double-detonation scenarios {{in the case of a}} system with a 0. 6 M_ helium secondary and a 0. 9 M_ primary.

50|$|Photoemission Electron {{microscopy}} (PEEM, {{also called}} photoelectron microscopy, PEM) {{is a widely}} used type of emission microscopy.

PEEM measures the coefficient indirectly by collecting the emitted secondary electrons generated in the electron cascade that follows {{the creation of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>core</b> hole in the absorption process. PEEM is a surface sensitive technique because the emitted electrons originate from a very shallow layer. In physics, this technique is referred to as PEEM, which goes together naturally with low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM). In biology, it is called photoelectron microscopy (PEM), which fits with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).|$|E
