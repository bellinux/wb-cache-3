5|$|Even where a {{concurrent}} use registration is issued, the parties may eventually {{come to an}} agreement under which one <b>party</b> <b>will</b> surrender its registration. In some instances, a <b>party</b> <b>will</b> simply happen to cease using the mark in favor of a new brand name, and the registration will lapse. In other cases, the larger company will eventually acquire the smaller.|$|E

5000|$|A viable {{political}} party system: Kenya aims at a political <b>party</b> system that <b>will</b> {{be guided by}} policy and ideological differences rather than region of ethnicity. Founding of political parties on religious, linguistic, racial, ethnic, gender, corporate or regional basis will be prohibited. All political <b>parties</b> <b>will</b> be obliged to subscribe to a legally-binding Code of Conduct. There will be a clear definition of circumstances under which a party may be de-registered or reinstated. The delegation of state functions to (or the use of state resources by) political <b>parties</b> <b>will</b> not be permitted. Political <b>parties</b> <b>will</b> be required to publish their manifestos before participating in elections.|$|R

30|$|In the {{proposed}} protocol, {{we use a}} variant of the threshold decryption protocol which is the so-called private threshold decryption [74]. The requirement of this protocol {{is that one of the}} t <b>parties</b> <b>will</b> be the only <b>party</b> who <b>will</b> recover the secret. All t− 1 other parties follow the protocol and broadcast their shares to achieve this requirement. The <b>party</b> who <b>will</b> learn the plaintext proceeds with the decryption process privately, collects all decryption shares from the t− 1 other parties, and privately reconstructs the message. The remaining <b>parties</b> <b>will</b> not get any information about the message.|$|R
5|$|To defeat more {{powerful}} monsters and gain experience points efficiently, players can join a party. A regular party {{has room for}} six members. Like in many other games, a well-balanced <b>party</b> <b>will</b> consist of several archetypes- namely a healer, a tank (the party member with high defense {{that will be the}} main target of the monster), and the damage dealer. The enmity system comes into play heavily in parties, as players try to keep the monsters attention off fragile jobs and on the tanks. A well-balanced team working together {{is the only way to}} defeat many of the game's enemies.|$|E
5|$|Costa, Thomas, and J.B. go to buy {{marijuana}} from drug-dealer T-Rick. While T-Rick {{gets the}} marijuana, Costa steals his lawn gnome {{to use as}} a party mascot. As they leave, T-Rick discovers his gnome stolen and chases after them but they escape in Thomas' mini-van. As night falls, the party's start time passes but no one turns up and Thomas worries that the <b>party</b> <b>will</b> fail. Suddenly, party-goers arrive en-masse. Thomas intends to limit the party to the backyard and poolhouse with the house guarded by two young security guards, Everett and Tyler. However, more and more people begin to arrive and the party moves beyond their control and into the house. Thomas questions Costa on how he advertised the party, forcing him to confess that he put ads on Craigslist and on a local radio station, worried that no one would attend.|$|E
5|$|Most {{concurrent}} use proceedings {{result in a}} legal settlement between the parties. Frequently, one <b>party</b> <b>will</b> surrender its {{concurrent use}} claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each party may agree to geographic limitations on its use of the mark at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no confusion is likely. A benefit of such an agreement is that the parties can agree to terms {{beyond the scope of}} the TTAB's decision, such as specific restrictions on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer confusion is likely to result from the concurrent use registration. Even if both parties assert that no confusion is likely, the TTAB may still make findings of fact which demonstrate that confusion is likely, and deny registration to the junior user of the mark.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{system is}} similar to its predecessor's, with the {{effectiveness}} of an attack dependent on the timing accuracy of separate actions. The battles still consist of turn-based attacks executed by Mario and Luigi, although these are compounded by the babies' actions during an attack. The Bros. movesmoves performed by Mario and Luigi collectivelyhave been replaced by Bros. Items, which are finite attacks that are gained in the overworld. Similar to the Bros. moves, these are more damaging attacks that can be performed by all 4 characters collectively. Only the adults receive damage, even though the babies will become vulnerable once their respective partners have been eliminated from battle. The elimination of babies will also affect battle as some Bros. Items will become disabled, and the <b>party</b> <b>will</b> {{not be able to}} defend itself with hammers, which are wielded exclusively by the babies.|$|E
5|$|Ofuji was {{responsible}} for creating the basic scenario from which Brotherhoods main writers would work: working from the character sheets created by the writers of Final Fantasy XV, he created the entire scenario based on each character's background characteristics, such as Ignis' love of baking and Prompto's childhood obesity. The anime focuses on themes of brotherhood and friendship, and includes interpersonal scenes {{that could not be}} included in the game. Its storyline details the backstory of Noctis from his childhood to the game's opening, along with the backstories of his companions. The first and last episodes tie directly into the events of , a free tech demo showing Noctis' journey through a dreamworld during a near-death experience. The anime also serves as an introduction for potential players to the characters. In previous Final Fantasy games, the player party was built up gradually {{over the course of the}} game. In Final Fantasy XV, the complete <b>party</b> <b>will</b> be available from the start, and since the backstory moments could not be fitted into the game, the anime serves as a similar means of allowing players to sympathize with them. Each episode's event also helped detail some of the characters' different social classes, with the cited example being the contrast between Prompto's small house and hard-working parents when compared to Gladiolus' more luxurious life.|$|E
