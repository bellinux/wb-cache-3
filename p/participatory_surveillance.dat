40|$|Background: Influenza {{outbreaks}} affect {{millions of}} people every year and its surveillance is usually carried out in developed countries through a network of sentinel doctors who report the weekly number of Influenza-like Illness cases observed among the visited patients. Monitoring and forecasting the evolution of these outbreaks supports decision makers in designing effective interventions and allocating resources to mitigate their impact. Objectives: Describe the existing <b>participatory</b> <b>surveillance</b> approaches {{that have been used}} for modeling and forecasting of the seasonal influenza epidemic, and how they can help strengthen real-time epidemic science and provide a more rigorous understanding of epidemic conditions. Methods: We describe three different <b>participatory</b> <b>surveillance</b> systems, WISDM (Widely Internet Sourced Distributed Monitoring), InfluenzaNet and Flu Near You (FNY), and show how modeling and simulation can be or has been combined with participatory disease surveillance to: i) measure the non-response bias in a <b>participatory</b> <b>surveillance</b> sample using WISDM; and ii) nowcast and forecast influenza activity {{in different parts of the}} world (using InfluenzaNet and Flu Near You). Results: WISDM based results measure the participatory and sample bias for three epidemic metrics i. e. attack rate, peak infection rate, and time-to-peak, and find the participatory bias to be the largest component of the total bias. InfluenzaNet platform shows that digital <b>participatory</b> <b>surveillance</b> data combined with a realistic data-driven epidemiological model can provide both short-term and long-term forecasts of epidemic intensities; and the ground truth data lie within the 95 percent confidence intervals for most weeks. The statistical accuracy of the ensemble forecasts increase as the season progresses. The Flu Near You platform shows that <b>participatory</b> <b>surveillance</b> data provide accurate short-term flu activity forecasts and influenza activity predictions. The correlation of the HealthMap Flu Trends estimates with the observed CDC ILI rates is 0. 99 for 2013 - 2015. Additional data sources lead to an error reduction of about 40...|$|E
40|$|A {{case study}} of a World of Warcraft guild explores the {{relationship}} between <b>participatory</b> <b>surveillance,</b> public discipline, empowerment, and fun.

We conducted an evaluation participatory epidemiology (PE) and PDS capacity building outcomes by examining PDS as a surveillance tool for national animal disease surveillance. The evaluation framework pillars (relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and impact) were developed from over 30 indicators adapted from established animal and public health surveillance criteria together with additional measures of sustainability and participation. Data were collected from 120 individuals by workshops, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews in Benin, Nigeria, Pakistan, Tanzania, Togo and Uganda. PDS results were consistent with other data for absence of disease but the absence of detected cases and a dearth of epidemiological and surveillance data prevented quantification of some indicators. In contexts of limited epidemiological capacity, PDS was considered a useful epidemiological tool, most appropriate for small-scale farmers and applied in complement to conventional surveillance. PDS generated large amounts of unanalyzed data which were incompatible with conventional databases. The approach did not alter the one-way information flow characteristic of surveillance systems. PE skills continued {{to be used by}} some individual practitioners but PDS sustainability was compromised by dependence on external funding, the lack of legal frameworks and failure to integrate into national surveillance systems.

40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (HPAI), subtype H 5 N 1, was first officially reported in Indonesia in 2004. Since then {{the disease has}} spread and is now endemic in {{large parts of the}} country. This study investigated the statistical relationship between a set of risk factors and {{the presence or absence of}} HPAI in Indonesia during 2006 and 2007. HPAI was evaluated through <b>participatory</b> disease <b>surveillance</b> (PDS) in backyard village chickens (the study population), and risk factors included descriptors of people and poultry distribution (separating chickens, ducks and production sectors), poultry movement patterns and agro-ecological conditions. The study showed that the risk factors "elevation", "human population density" and "rice cropping" were significant in accounting for the spatial variation of the PDS-defined HPAI cases. These findings were consistent with earlier studies in Thailand and Vietnam. In addition "commercial poultry population", and two indicators of market locations and transport; "human settlements" and "road length", were identified as significant risk factors in the models. In contrast to several previous studies carried out in Southeast Asia, domestic backyard ducks were not found to be a significant risk factor in Indonesia. The study used surrogate estimates of market locations and marketing chains and further work should focus on the actual location of the live bird markets, and on the flow of live poultry and poultry products between them, so that patterns of possible transmission, and regions of particular risk could be better inferred.

Animal health was believed to cause about one-fourth of the yield gaps seen in developing countries, but almost all research centreed on just two diseases thought to have greatest impacts on productivity: trypanosomosis and East Coast fever. Human health impacts were explicitly not a priority. By 2000 ILRI began actively to address zoonoses, but only {{in the context of their}} threat to intensifying smallholder production. By 2004, human health was an objective in its own right and the first research programme dedicated to zoonoses and food safety at ILRI began in 2011.

In the second scenario, results for all poultry species were analyzed. Poultry flocks in 916 households located in 717 villages were inspected by CAHO practitioners, who collected 3458 bird samples. In the first scenario, CAHO practitioners presented sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) estimates of 40 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 21 %– 59 %) and 92 % (95 % CI: 91 %– 94 %), respectively. In the second scenario, diagnostic performance estimates were Se = 47 % (95 % CI: 29 %– 65 %) and Sp = 88 % (95 % CI: 86 %– 90 %). A significant difference was observed only between Sp estimates (P < 0. 01). Practitioners' diagnostics and RRT-PCR results were in very poor agreement with kappa values of 0. 16 and 0. 14 for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. However, the use of a broad case definition, the possible presence of immunity against the virus in replacement birds, and the low prevalence observed during the survey would negatively affect the practitioners' performance.

40|$|Effective {{surveillance}} for {{infectious diseases}} {{is an essential}} and resource-consuming activity for mitigating unwanted consequences for animal and public health. Allocation of scarce resources for surveillance must be considered against alternative prevention and control measures and regularly reviewed. Few studies estimate cost-effectiveness and benefits of different animal disease surveillance approaches and systems. In this study, we considered the benefits and resource costs of participatory epidemiology (PE) surveys and <b>participatory</b> disease <b>surveillance</b> (PDS) compared with routine passive surveillance. Focusing on a 6 -month interval in a primarily pastoralist district in Kenya, basic performance indicators for surveillance measured were (1) number of outbreaks; (2) number of samples generated from suspected outbreaks; (3) number of positive laboratory confirmations. Costs of passive surveillance and interventions mounted were determined for the 6 -month interval. In the same district, PE surveys were conducted in randomly selected communities {{to determine the number}} of outbreaks of notifiable cattle diseases in the same 6 -month interval. Additional information was collected on the scale of morbidity and mortality for historical outbreaks (numbers and duration), the value of individual animals and the number of active outbreaks. Costs associated with mounting PE visits were ascertained and extrapolated to district level. One month after completion of PE visits, district level stakeholders were interviewed to determine the response, if any, to outbreaks detected during the visits. The study provides cost effectiveness estimates at a district level for the 6 -month interval, including losses which occurred from outbreaks missed by passive surveillance and costs if PE were applied at regular intervals. In addition, the findings consider available prevention and control responses and provide decision-makers with evidence to inform future application of participatory approaches in animal disease surveillance...|$|R
40|$|In {{the decades}} since chronic {{illnesses}} replaced infectious diseases {{as the leading}} causes of death, public health researchers, particularly those {{in the field of}} health promotion and chronic disease prevention, have shifted their focus from the individual to the community in recognition that community-level changes will foster and sustain individual behavior change. The former emphasis on individual lifestyle change has been broadened to include social and environmental factors, often without increased resources. To find new ways to support community health promotion at the national level, the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion and the Division of Adult and Community Health invited an external panel of experts to participate in the National Expert Panel on Community Health Promotion. This article highlights the process through which the expert panel developed its eight recommendations. The recommendations include issues related to community-based <b>participatory</b> research and <b>surveillance,</b> training and capacity building, new approaches for health and wellness, and changes in federal investments. They illustrate the steps needed to broaden the traditional scope of public health and to advance a new vision for improving community health and wellness...|$|R
