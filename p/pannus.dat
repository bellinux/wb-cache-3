5|$|Cumulus clouds come in four {{distinct}} species, cumulis humilis, mediocris, congestus, and fractus. These {{species may}} be arranged into the variety, cumulus radiatus; {{and may be}} accompanied by up to seven supplementary features, cumulus pileus, velum, virga, praecipitatio, arcus, <b>pannus,</b> and tuba.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{supplementary}} features are most commonly {{seen with the}} species congestus. Cumulus virga clouds are cumulus clouds producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and cumulus praecipitatio produce precipitation that reaches the Earth's surface. Cumulus <b>pannus</b> comprise shredded clouds that normally appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation. Cumulus arcus clouds have a gust front, and cumulus tuba clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes. Cumulus pileus clouds refer to cumulus clouds that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus {{over the top of}} the cloud. Cumulus velum clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of the cloud.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{superficial}} keratitis (<b>pannus)</b> {{is a form}} of superficial keratitis, or {{inflammation of}} the cornea, found most commonly in German Shepherds, Greyhounds, and Siberian Huskies.|$|E
25|$|The disease {{progresses}} {{by forming}} granulation tissue {{at the edges}} of the synovial lining, <b>pannus</b> with extensive angiogenesis and enzymes causing tissue damage. The synovium thickens, cartilage and underlying bone begin to disintegrate and the joint is getting destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The biggest {{challenge}} {{in this type}} of prostheses is the difficulty in its future removal. This is due to the formation of <b>pannus</b> fibrotic around the valve body and sewing ring. To separate the parts is very laborious, keeping intact the sewing ring, which will be used in the coupling of the new valve.|$|E
25|$|The species fractus shows {{variable}} instability {{because it}} can be a subdivision of genus-types of different physical forms that have different stability characteristics. This subtype can be in the form of ragged but mostly stable stratiform sheets (stratus fractus) or small ragged cumuliform heaps with somewhat greater instability (cumulus fractus). When they form at low altitudes, stratiform and cumuliform genus-types can be torn up into shreds by brisk low level winds that create mechanical turbulence against the ground. Fractus clouds can form in precipitation at low altitudes, with or without brisk or gusty winds. They are closely associated with precipitating cloud systems of considerable vertical and sometimes horizontal extent, so they are also classified as accessory clouds under the name <b>pannus</b> (see section on supplementary features).|$|E
500|$|The species Cumulus fractus is ragged in {{appearance}} and can form in clear air as {{a precursor to}} cumulus humilis and larger cumulus species-types; or it can form in precipitation as the supplementary feature <b>pannus</b> (also called scud) which can also include stratus fractus of bad weather. Cumulus humilis clouds look like puffy, flattened shapes. Cumulus mediocris clouds look similar, except that they have some vertical development. Cumulus congestus clouds have a cauliflower-like structure and tower high into the atmosphere, hence their alternate name [...] "towering cumulus". The variety Cumulus radiatus forms in radial bands called cloud streets and can comprise {{any of the four}} species of cumulus.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the fifth}} (and final) book is a {{discussion}} of paranatellonta via the myth of Andromeda and Perseus. Manilius recalls how Andromeda was chosen to be sacrificed to a sea monster by her parents, Cepheus and Cassiopeia. Andromeda was chained to a cliff, but, before the creature could consume its victim, Perseus (who had just vanquished Medusa) stumbled onto the scene. He instantly {{fell in love with}} Andromeda, killed the sea monster, and saved the young woman's life. According to Green, the digression, which is by far the longest in the poem, [...] "is very well chosen, in as much as no other mythological episode involves so many future constellations interacting at the same time: Andromeda (e.g.5.544), Perseus (e.g.5.67), the Sea Monsterstrictly, Cetus (cf.5.600), but often referred to in more generic terms during this story as belua (5.544, 608) and monstrum (5.581)Medusa's head (e.g.5.567), and Andromeda's parents, Cepheus and Cassiopeia". Green contends that the story is perfect for Manilius (he is able to use it to justify the constellations' proximity to one another and their eternal arrangement, as he had previously argued in 1.354360). Conversely, Housman compared it unfavorably to Ovid's version of the story, and called Manilius's retelling [...] "a sewn-on patch of far from the best purple" [...] (purpurae non sane splendidissimae adsutus <b>pannus).</b> A similar sentiment was expressed by the Cambridge classicist Arthur Woollgar Verrall, who wrote that while the episode {{was meant to be a}} [...] "show piece", it comes across as [...] "a poor mixture of childish rhetoric and utter commonplace". Between lines 5.70910, there is a large lacuna (raising the possibility that the Astronomica is an unfinished work), and then the last few lines of the book [...] concern stars and other stellar phenomena, and the book ends with a simile about the [...] "res publica of stars". This sectionin which Manilius proposes that the stars constitute an elaborate and organized commonwealth, defined by a hierarchy that prevents [...] "cosmic disaster"seems to be a way for Manilius to assert the legitimacy of the Roman state through analogy.|$|E
2500|$|Muslim {{physicians}} described {{such conditions}} as <b>pannus,</b> glaucoma (described as ‘headache of the pupil’), phlyctenulae, and operations on the conjunctiva. [...] They {{were the first}} to use the words 'retina' and 'cataract'.|$|E
2500|$|Supplementary cloud {{formations}} {{detached from}} the main cloud are known as accessory clouds. [...] The heavier precipitating clouds, nimbostratus, towering cumulus (cumulus congestus), and cumulonimbus typically see the formation in precipitation of the <b>pannus</b> feature, low ragged clouds of the genera and species cumulus fractus or stratus fractus.|$|E
2500|$|A {{group of}} {{accessory}} clouds comprise formations {{that are associated}} mainly with upward-growing cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds of free convection. Pileus is a cap cloud that can form over a cumulonimbus or large cumulus cloud, whereas a velum feature is a thin horizontal sheet that sometimes forms like an apron around the middle or {{in front of the}} parent cloud. [...] An accessory cloud recently officially recognized the World meteorological Organization is the flumen, also known more informally as the beaver's tail. It is formed by the warm, humid inflow of a super-cell thunderstorm, and can be mistaken for a tornado. Although the flumen can indicate a tornado risk, it is similar in appearance to <b>pannus</b> or scud clouds and does not rotate.|$|E

6000|$|The {{bibliography}} of the Giaour is beset with difficulties, {{and it is}} doubtful if more than approximate accuracy can be secured. The composition of the entire poem in its present shape was accomplished within six months, May-November, 1813, but during that period it was expanded by successive accretions from a first draft of 407 lines (extant in MS.) to a seventh edition of 1334 lines. A proof is extant of an edition of 28 pages containing 460 lines, itself an enlargement on the MS.; but whether (as a note in the handwriting of the late Mr. Murray affirms) this was or was not published is uncertain. A portion of a second proof of 38 pages has been preserved, but of {{the publication of the}} poem in this state there is no record. On June 5 a first edition of 41 pages, containing 685 lines, was issued, and of this numerous copies are extant. At the end of June, or the beginning of July, 1813, a second edition, entitled, a [...] "New Edition with some Additions," [...] appeared. This consisted of 47 pages, and numbered 816 lines. Among the accretions is to be found the famous passage beginning, [...] "He that hath bent him o'er the dead." [...] Two MS. copies of this <b>pannus</b> vere purpureus are in Mr. Murray's possession. At the end of July, and {{during the first half of}} August, two or more issues of a third edition were set up in type. The first issue amounted to 53 pages, containing 950 lines, was certainly published in this form, and possibly a second issue of 56 pages, containing 1004 lines, may have followed at a brief interval. A revise of this second issue, dated August 13, is extant. In the last fortnight of August a fourth edition of 58 pages, containing 1048 lines, undoubtedly saw the light. Scarcely more than a few days can have elapsed before a fifth edition of 66 pages, containing 1215 lines, was ready to supplant the fourth edition. A sixth edition, a reproduction of the fifth, may have appeared in October. A seventh edition of 75 pages, containing 1334 lines, which presented the poem in its final shape, was issued subsequently to November 27, 1813 (a seventh edition was advertised in the Morning Chronicle, December 22, 1813), the date of the last revise, or of an advance copy of the issue. The ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth editions belong to 1814, while a fourteenth edition is known to have been issued in 1815. In that year and henceforward the Giaour was included in the various collected editions of Byron's works. The subjoined table assigns to their several editions the successive accretions in their order as now published:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Plutarch {{is perhaps}} the most eminent example of how strong a hold simple good humor and good sense lay upon the {{affections}} of mankind. Not a man of genius or heroism himself, his many points of sympathy with both make him an admirable conductor of them in that less condensed form which is more wholesome and acceptable to the average mind. Of no man can it be more truly said that, if not a rose himself, he had lived all his days in the rose's neighborhood. Such is the delightful equableness of his temperament and his singular talent for reminiscence, so far is he always from undue heat while still susceptible of so much enthusiasm as shall not disturb digestion, that he might seem to have been born middle-aged. Few men have so amicably combined the love of a good dinner and of the higher morality. He seems to have comfortably solved the problem of having your cake and eating it, at which the ascetic interpreters of Christianity teach us to despair. He serves us up his worldly wisdom in a sauce of Plato, and gives a kind of sensuous relish to the disembodied satisfactions of immortality. He is a better Christian than many an orthodox divine. If he do not, like Sir Thomas Browne, love to lose himself in an O, altitudo! yet the sky-piercing peaks and snowy solitudes of ethical speculation loom always on the horizon about the sheltered dwelling of his mind, and he continually gets up from his books to rest and refresh his eyes upon them. He seldom invites us to alpine-climbing, and when he does, it is to some warm nook like the Jardin on Mont Blanc, a parenthesis of homely summer nestled amid the sublime nakedness of snow. If he glance upward at becoming intervals to the [...] "primal duties," [...] he turns back with a settled predilection to the [...] "sympathies that are nestled at the feet like flowers." [...] But it is within his villa that we love to be admitted to him and to enjoy that garrulity which we forgive more readily in the mother of the muses than in any of her daughters, unless it be Clio, who is most like her. If we are in the library, he is reminded of this or that passage in a favorite author, and, going to the shelves, takes down the volume to read it aloud with decorous emphasis. If we are in the atrium (where we like him best) he has an anecdote to tell of all the great Greeks and Romans whose busts or statues are ranged about us, and who for the first time soften from their marble alienation and become human. It is this that makes him so amiable a moralist and brings his lessons home to us. He does not preach up any remote and inaccessible virtue, but makes all his lessons of magnanimity, self-devotion, patriotism seem neighborly and practicable to us by an example which associates them with our common humanity. His higher teaching is theosophy with no taint of theology. He is a pagan Tillotson disencumbered of the archiepiscopal robes, a practical Christian unbewildered with doctrinal punctilios. This is evidently what commended him as a philosopher to Montaigne, as may be inferred from some hints which follow immediately upon the comparison between Seneca and Plutarch in the essay on [...] "Physiognomy." [...] After speaking of some [...] "escripts encores plus révérez," [...] he asks, in his idiomatic way, [...] "à, quoy faire nous allons nous gendarmant par ces efforts de la science?" [...] More than this, however, Montaigne liked him because he was good talk, as it is called, a better companion than writer. Yet he is not without passages which are noble in point of mere style. Landor remarks this in the conversation between Johnson and Tooke, where he makes Tooke say: [...] "Although his style is not valued by the critics, I could inform them that there are in Plutarch many passages of exquisite beauty, in regard to style, derived perhaps from authors much more ancient." [...] But if they are borrowed, they have none of the discordant effect of the purpureus <b>pannus,</b> for the warm sympathy of his nature assimilates them thoroughly and makes them his own. Oddly enough, it is through his memory that Plutarch is truly original. Who ever remembered so much and yet so well? It is this selectness (without being overfastidious) that gauges the natural elevation of his mind. He is a gossip, but he has supped with Plato or sat with Alexander in his tent to bring away only memorable things. We are speaking of him, of course, at his best. Many of his essays are trivial, but there is hardly one whose sands do not glitter here and there with the proof that the stream of his thought and experience has flowed down through auriferous soil. [...] "We sail on his memory into the ports of every nation," [...] says Mr. Emerson admirably in his Introduction to Goodwin's Plutarch's [...] "Morals." [...] No doubt we are becalmed pretty often, and yet our old skipper almost reconciles us with our dreary isolation, so well can he beguile the time, when he chooses, with anecdote and quotation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pannus</b> is an {{abnormal}} layer of fibrovascular tissue or granulation tissue. Common sites for <b>pannus</b> formation include over the cornea, over a joint surface (as seen in rheumatoid arthritis), or on a prosthetic heart valve. <b>Pannus</b> may grow in a tumor-like fashion, as in joints {{where it may}} erode articular cartilage and bone.|$|E

These lashes will lead to corneal opacities and scarring and then to blindness. Linear scar present in the Sulcus subtarsalis is called Arlt's line (named after Carl Ferdinand von Arlt).
