5000|$|Upon {{exiting the}} photomask-photoresist interface, the image-forming light {{is subject to}} {{near-field}} diffraction as it propagates through the photoresist. Diffraction causes the image to lose contrast with increasing depth into the photoresist. This {{can be explained by}} the rapid decay of the highest-order evanescent waves with increasing distance from the photomask-photoresist interface. This effect can be partly mitigated by using thinner photoresist. Contrast enhancements based on plasmon resonances and lensing films have recently been disclosed. [...] The chief advantage of contact lithography is the elimination of the need for complex <b>projection</b> <b>optics</b> between object and image. The resolution limit in today's projection optical systems originates from the finite size of the final imaging lens and its distance from the image plane. More specifically, the <b>projection</b> <b>optics</b> can only capture a limited spatial frequency spectrum from the object (photomask). Contact printing has no such resolution limit but is sensitive to the presence of defects on the mask or on the substrate.|$|E

5000|$|Chronochrome's color {{quality was}} impressive, as {{surviving}} specimens attest, {{and because the}} three frames were exposed and projected simultaneously, Kinemacolor's color bombardment and color fringes around moving objects were avoided.

50|$|Although {{successful}} commercially, Process 2 {{was plagued}} with technical problems. Because {{the images on}} {{the two sides of}} the print were not in the same plane, both could not be perfectly in focus at the same time. The significance of this depended on the depth of field of the <b>projection</b> <b>optics.</b> Much more serious was a problem with cupping. Films in general tended to become somewhat cupped after repeated use: every time a film was projected, each frame in turn was heated by the intense light in the projection gate, causing it to bulge slightly; after it had passed through the gate, it cooled and the bulge subsided, but not quite completely. It was found that the cemented prints were not only very prone to cupping, but that the direction of cupping would suddenly and randomly change from back to front or vice versa, so that even the most attentive projectionist could not prevent the image from temporarily popping out of focus whenever the cupping direction changed. Technicolor had to supply new prints so the cupped ones could be shipped to their Boston laboratory for flattening, after which they could be put back into service, at least for a while. The presence of image layers on both surfaces made the prints especially vulnerable to scratching, and because the scratches were vividly colored they were very noticeable. Splicing a Process 2 print without special attention to its unusual laminated construction was apt to result in a weak splice that would fail as it passed through the projector. Even before these problems became apparent, Technicolor regarded this cemented print approach as a stopgap and was already at work developing an improved process.|$|E

The results show that {{there is more than one}} reasoning possibility that is feasible for students to use when dealing with the same problem. The results also illustrate how several different ways of reasoning may be simultaneously needed to solve a refraction problem. The different kinds of reasoning have been referred to as reasoning categories in this study. The analysis illustrates how the categories complement each other, and the use of many reasoning categories is shown to be fruitful. However, the vast majority of the participants made contradicting answer selections when solving similar problems by using contradicting reasoning approaches. This lack of consistency in the participants’ reasoning could indicate that they have a fragmentary understanding of optics in general. Both the capability to link reasoning approaches together, as well as the affordances that different modes of representations offer, are needed for the construction of a better conceptual understanding. Only mastering a few ways of reasoning and a few modes of representation could lead to fragmented knowledge, which, in turn leads to making problem solving really challenging. One purpose of this study was to find out if reasoning categories and modes of representations are essentially linked. If so, then the reasoning categories would be determined by the representation of the problem. The analysis shows that there is a connection, but that there are also other factors at play...|$|R

In the first part we introduce active colloids {{in the context of}} active matter and focus on the particular case of phoretic colloids. The general theory of phoresis is presented along with an expression for the phoretic velocity of a colloid and its rotational diffusion in two and three dimensions. We introduce a model for thermally active colloids that absorb light and emit heat and propel through thermophoresis. Using this model we develop the equations of motion for their collective dynamics and consider excluded volume through a lattice gas formalism. Solutions to the thermoattractive collective dynamics are studied in one dimension analytically and numerically. A few numerical results are presented for the collective dynamics in two dimensions. We simulate an unconfined system of thermally active colloids under directed illumination with simple <b>projection</b> based geometric <b>optics.</b> This system self-organises into a comet-like swarm and exhibits a wide range of non- equilibrium phenomena. In the second part we review the background of polymer translocation, including key experiments, theoretical progress and simulation studies. We present, discuss and use a common model to investigate the potential of patterned nanopores for stochastic sensing and identification of polynucleotides and other heteropolymers. Three pore patterns are characterised in terms of the response of a homopolymer with varying attractive affinity. This is extended to simple periodic block co-polymer heterostructures and a model device is proposed and demonstrated with two stochastic sensing algorithms. We find that mul- tiple sequential measurements of the translocation time is sufficient for identification with high accuracy. Motivated by fluctuating biological channels and the prospect of frequency based selectivity we investigate the response of a homopolymer through a pore that has a time dependent geometry. We show that a time dependent mobility can capture many features of the frequency response. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|Signal is a {{proof of}} concept {{prototype}} for a design that filters and visualises notifications on interior surfaces as projected light signals. It helps avoid distractions caused by traditional mobile notifications interrupting the flow of natural activity by improving the signal-to-noise ratio of a notification stream and making it available in an architectural setting without requiring interaction with a smartphone or other computing device. The shared visibility, privacy and communication aspects of light signal notifications are explored in the research section, and design validation is sought after using software architecture sketches and physical prototyping with real electronic components in the design section. A key concept in the design philosophy of Signal is the invisible user interface, where the device itself is made invisible and accessed indirectly via software and gestures. The use of Signal is intimately tied to a physical location, and accessible by an individual or multiple users in a shared context. Prototyping reveals that silent and smooth Signal motion is possible using smart memory alloy actuators. A minimum beam angle imposes a physical restriction on the <b>projection</b> distance and <b>optics</b> using an LED light source because of overlap between individual signal channels and the design requirement for minimal visual footprint. The fringe effects and diffraction caused by the shifting lens focus creates a flexible and beautiful visual impression adaptable for various interiors. For accurate long distance projection, lasers with diffraction gratings could be used. A Signal device with 3 or more channels would be fairly expensive as a consumer level product because of the SMA components and high-powered LED units, while reliability, total power consumption and operating costs are reasonable.
