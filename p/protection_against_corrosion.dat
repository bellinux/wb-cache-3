2500|$|The modern {{recovery}} boiler is {{of a single}} drum design, with vertical steam generating bank and wide spaced superheaters. This design was first proposed by Colin MacCallum in 1973 in a proposal by Götaverken (now Metso Power inc.) for a large {{recovery boiler}} having a capacity of 4,000,000lb of black liquor solids per day for a boiler in Skutskär, Sweden, but this design was rejected as being too advanced at that time by the prospective owner. [...] MacCallum presented the design at BLRBAC and in a paper [...] "The Radiant Recovery Boiler" [...] printed in Tappi magazine in December 1980. [...] The first boiler of this single-drum design was sold by Götaverken at Leaf River in Mississippi in 1984. [...] The construction of the vertical steam generating bank {{is similar to the}} vertical economizer. Vertical boiler bank is easy to keep clean. The spacing between superheater panels increased and leveled off at over 300 but under 400mm. Wide spacing in superheaters helps to minimize fouling. This arrangement, in combination with sweetwater attemperators, ensures maximum <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>corrosion.</b> There have been numerous improvements in recovery boiler materials to limit corrosion.|$|E

50|$|Plasma {{electrolytic}} oxidation (PEO), {{also known as}} electrolytic plasma oxidation (EPO) or microarc oxidation (MAO), is an electrochemical surface treatment process for generating oxide coatings on metals. It is similar to anodizing, but it employs higher potentials, so that discharges occur and the resulting plasma modifies {{the structure of the}} oxide layer. This process can be used to grow thick (tens or hundreds of micrometers), largely crystalline, oxide coatings on metals such as aluminium, magnesium and titanium. Because they can present high hardness and a continuous barrier, these coatings can offer <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> wear, <b>corrosion</b> or heat as well as electrical insulation.|$|R
