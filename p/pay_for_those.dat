5|$|Stretford {{was part}} of the ancient parish of Manchester, within the {{historic}} county boundaries of Lancashire. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, a national scheme for dealing with the relief of the poor, Stretford joined the Chorlton Poor Law Union in 1837, one of three such unions in Manchester, before transferring to the Barton-upon-Irwell Poor Law Union in 1849. In 1867, Stretford Local Board of Health was established, assuming responsibility for the local government of the area in 1868. The board's responsibilities included sanitation and the maintenance of the highways, and it had the authority to levy rates to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> services. The local board continued in that role until it was superseded by the creation of Stretford Urban District Council in 1894, {{as a result of the}} Local Government Act 1894.|$|E

25|$|Record {{economic}} growth {{starting in the}} mid-1980s mostly erased the problem of finances preventing service. As a secondary measure, starting in 1990, paying for a mission became easier on those called to work in industrialized nations. Missionaries began paying into a church-wide general missionary fund instead of paying on their own. This amount paid (about $425 per month currently) {{is used by the}} church to pay for the costs of all missionaries, wherever they go. This enabled those going to Bolivia, whose average cost of living is about $100 per month, to help <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> going to Japan, whose cost tops out at around $900 per month.|$|E
25|$|At the time, Owen Field did {{not have}} {{permanent}} artificial lighting sufficient for television broadcasts at night. This meant that untelevised home games had to start {{in the morning or}} early afternoon so as to be completed by dark, because the cost of leasing a set of portable lights was too high for a game that would not earn enough revenue to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> lights. For all televised games, portable lights on trucks were rented – but the leasing costs cut into the university's revenue, and often the four or five portable light trucks stayed on campus for weeks in anticipation of the next televised game. True night games were difficult to play in Norman because of the amount of portable lighting needed to illuminate the field adequately for spectators to see the players, much less the light required for television. Prior to 1982, the university knew which games would be televised and could plan months ahead for leasing the necessary lighting.|$|E
500|$|Justice Sonia Sotomayor {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the Court. [...] Sotomayor first noted {{that this was not a}} case of first impression, and that the court had ruled on a similar issue only seven years previously. [...] Sotomayor stated that Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. Leavitt held that when the government makes a contractual promise to pay in return for services, the government is bound to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> services. [...] This was a long-standing principle of contract law, dating back to Ferris, and the [...] "principle safeguards both the expectations of Government contractors and the long-term fiscal interests of the United States." [...] If the appropriation exceeds the amount of the individual contract, then the government is bound to honor the contract. [...] Sotomayor stated that although the situation that Congress placed the BIA in is frustrating, but it is an issue for Congress to resolve. [...] The Court affirmed the decision of the Tenth Circuit Court. [...] Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Elena Kagan joined Justice Sotomayor's opinion.|$|E

2500|$|In London, the Rockingham {{government}} came {{to power}} (July 1765) and Parliament debated whether to repeal the stamp tax or to send an army to enforce it.

Parliament agreed and repealed the tax (February 21, 1766), but insisted in the Declaratory Act of March 1766 that they retained full power to make laws for the colonies [...] "in all cases whatsoever". The repeal nonetheless caused widespread celebrations in the colonies.|$|E
2500|$|Rottmann {{described}} {{medical care}} as [...] “marginal”. A shortage of doctors, medical equipment and drugs meant those wounded often died, usually in immense pain. Morphine was {{unknown in the}} Red Army. Most Red Army soldiers had not received preventive inoculations and diseases were major problems with malaria, pneumonia, diphtheria, tuberculosis, typhus, dysentery, and meningitis in particular regularly sickening Red Army men. In the winter frostbite often sent soldiers to the medical system while {{in the spring and}} fall rains made trench foot a common aliment. The frontovik were paid once every month, but often did not receive their wages. All soldiers were exempt from taxes. In 1943, a private was paid 600 roubles per month, a corporal 1,000 roubles, a junior sergeant 2,000 roubles and a sergeant 3,000 roubles. There was special <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> serving in guards units, paratroopers, tank, anti-tank and those decorated for bravery in combat. Those units that greatly distinguished in combat had the prefix Guards attached to their unit title, a title of great respect and honor that brought better pay and rations. In the Imperial Russian Army, the elite was always the Imperial Guards Regiments, and the title Guards when applied to a military unit in Russia still has elitist connotations.|$|E
2500|$|Regardless {{of these}} {{misleading}} reassurances, Bulgaria defended Jews with Bulgarian citizenship from Nazi deportation orders. Reluctant {{to comply with}} the German requests to deport non-Bulgarian Jews, in late 1942 and early 1943, the Bulgarian government utilized Swiss diplomatic channels to inquire whether {{it would be possible to}} deport these Jews to British-controlled Palestine by ships via the Black Sea rather than taking them to concentration camps by trains. Rumors were widespread about the fate of Jews who were [...] "relocated to the east" [...] (i.e. to their deaths), and Bulgaria balked at having to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> trains. However, this request was denied by the British Foreign Minister, Anthony Eden. After this failure, the Bulgarian government finally succumbed to German demands to transport non-Bulgarian Jews to its border with Romania on the river Danube, surrendering them to the Nazi German authorities and thus sending them to their deaths. As a result, the Jewish communities of Bulgarian-controlled Yugoslavia and Greece were almost completely wiped out. There was much harsh treatment before the Jews were transported in German cattle-cars to Treblinka. A few dozen Bitola Jews managed to avoid deportation, and four escaped from the transit camp. None of the 3,276 Jews of Bitola deported to Treblinka survived. In 2003, one Jew remained in the city that had been home to a Sephardic community for more than 400 years. Štip's ancient Jewish community was also completely destroyed.|$|E
