Vegetation in this area were badly damaged, particularly the African Mahogany trees which were either snapped off or uprooted. Parts of Cable Beach were severely eroded. An area {{which used to be}} covered with sand was completely covered by rocks. The eastern side of Roebuck Bay had evidence of severe erosion of the coastal terrain. At Broome's only banana plantation, almost all crops were completely lost, with 10 out of 18,000 plants left surviving. Fortunately, most buildings in {{the town of}} Broome remained unharmed, although power supplies were cut to many parts of Broome for several days.The Broome power station was initially shut down at approximately midnight on 20 April amid fears of damage to the <b>power</b> <b>reticulation</b> infrastructure.|$|E

Electric power engineering, {{as it applies to}} low-voltage <b>power</b> <b>reticulation</b> in buildings and industrial sites, is ripe for a ‘paradigm shift’ to bring it properly into the Electronic Age. The conventional alternating-current approach, now over a hundred years old, is increasingly unsatisfactory {{from the point of view}} of plant and appliance requirements. Alternative approaches can deliver substantial cost savings, higher efficiencies, power quality improvements, and greater safety. <b>Power</b> <b>reticulation</b> systems in the future can be expected to differ from present systems in two key respects. The first is a greatly increased role for direct current; the second is the augmentation of the power system with a wide range of ‘management’ technologies. Combining these two trends, which can already be observed today, leads to consideration of ‘managed DC’ <b>power</b> <b>reticulation</b> systems, operating from AC bulk supply mains via AC-DC converters.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a power electronic converter solution that {{is capable of}} providing rural electrification {{at a fraction of the}} current electrification cost. This saving could be brought about by implementing a cheaper way of <b>power</b> distribution and <b>reticulation.</b> Cheaper distribution practices imply weaker networks which inevitably leads to poor voltage regulation. Expanding on the concept of Custom Power, using cost-effective power electronics and high speed Digital Signal Processors, algorithms could be implemented to compensate for the poor voltage regulation at the customer end. This implies that current distribution practices can be revised to take advantage of the load-end voltage regulation principle. Conference Pape...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{earthing}} {{in electrical}} <b>power</b> <b>reticulation</b> has an interesting history. Initial power distribution systems did not deliberately reference the phase conductors to earth. Later, {{depending on the}} application, there was a bifurcation of earthing practices, with some systems solidly earthed through low impedance resistors and some loosely earthed through high impedance resistors. The coal mining industry in Australia has converged to high resistance earthing. The supply is removed on the first earth fault {{to ensure that the}} fault is not escalated on the occurrence of a second earth fault. While this has safety benefits, there are challenges for the design of sensitive earth leakage protection. This is further complicated with the introduction of Variable Speed Drives (VSDs). This paper charts the history of earthing and how it has influenced the way that earth fault protection is implemented in coal mines, both in Australia and overseas...|$|E
