5|$|In 597, a Benedictine monk {{had been}} sent by Pope GregoryI to start {{converting}} Pagan England to Christianity. The monk, Augustine, became the first Archbishop of Canterbury. Within two centuries, the ritual of anointing monarchs with holy oil and crowning them (initially with helmets) in a Christian ceremony had been established, and regalia took on a religious identity. There was still no <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> of coronation regalia; each monarch generally had a new set made, with {{which he or she}} was usually buried upon death.|$|E
5|$|Use of regalia by monarchs in England can {{be traced}} back to its early history. A <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> of {{coronation}} regalia, once belonging to Edward the Confessor, was established after he was made a saint in the 12thcentury. By the Tudor period it was usual for monarchs to inherit state regalia from his or her predecessor. Most of the present collection as a whole dates from around 350 years ago when King CharlesII ascended the throne. The medieval and Tudor regalia had been either sold or melted down by Oliver Cromwell, a republican who overthrew the monarchy in 1649, during the English Civil War. Only four original items pre-date the Restoration: a late 12th-century anointing spoon, which is the oldest object in the collection, and three early 17th-century swords.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{usually have}} 26 teeth: the incisors, {{known as the}} tusks, 12 {{deciduous}} premolars, and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> of adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in {{at the back of}} the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out when the elephant is four to six years old. The third set is lost at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth lasts until the elephant is in its early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.|$|E

5|$|In the {{majority}} of species of caecilians, the young are produced by vivipary. Typhlonectes compressicauda, a species from South America, is typical of these. Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time. They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs, but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct. This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths {{as long as their}} mother before being born. By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth. A <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> of teeth grow through soon after birth.|$|E

2500|$|Two full Stargate props were {{originally}} {{built for the}} SG-1 pilot , the second of which was reconstructed from the prop used in the film. [...] They are made of steel and fiberglass, and are [...] in diameter. The second prop is less detailed, and is used for exterior scenes; in the pilot it was used solely on the planet Chulak. The primary one is fully automated and capable of rotating and emitting light. [...] This is achieved {{by the use of}} a specially designed [...] circular gear, which turns the inner ring on a precise pinion drive wheel, using an eight horsepower electric motor. The top seven chevrons emit laser pulses which are read by a sensor fed into a computer responsible for the gate's movement, which is consequently able to start and stop the rotation very quickly. This main prop is kept almost immovably at the <b>permanent</b> <b>set</b> of the SGC, at Bridge Studios, Vancouver.|$|E
2500|$|Its {{inherent}} {{pluralism and}} great importance placed on individual autonomy impede any simplistic definition of Reform Judaism; its various strands regard Judaism throughout the ages as {{derived from a}} process of constant evolution.

A clear description became particularly challenging since the turn toward a policy favouring inclusiveness ("Big Tent" [...] in the United States) over a coherent theology in the 1970s. This largely overlapped with what researchers termed as the transition from [...] "Classical" [...] to [...] "New" [...] Reform in America, paralleled in the other, smaller branches across the world. The movement ceased stressing principles and core beliefs, focusing more on the personal spiritual experience and communal participation. This shift was not accompanied by a distinct new doctrine or by the abandonment of the former, but rather with ambiguity.

In such a genus as 'Cebus', for example (Fig. 17), it will be found that while in some secondary points, such as the projection of the canines and the diastema, the resemblance to the great ape is preserved; in other and most important respects, the dentition is extremely different. Instead of 20 teeth in the milk set, there are 24: instead of 32 teeth in the <b>permanent</b> <b>set,</b> there are 36, the false molars being increased from eight to twelve.

Gwinnett county government functions were first carried out {{in the house and the}} backyard. Early sessions of the Superior Court (1819-1822), serving several other counties including Gwinnett County, were held in Winn's barn on the third floor. The Inferior Court and the first county elections were held in the parlor of the Elisha Winn House. In 1819, Gwinnett County had a full slate of elected county officials. The first Gwinnett County jail was built on the property, the jail was a small barn in the backyard, which was demolished in August 1933. Also, the first five judges of the Inferior Court, including Elisha Winn, were commissioned in February 1819. In 1820, the newly created Lawrenceville, became the <b>permanent</b> <b>setting</b> for the seat of government. A wooded courthouse was erected and the county government moved there.
