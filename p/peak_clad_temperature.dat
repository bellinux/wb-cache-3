40|$|Three heat {{transfer}} mechanisms {{exist in the}} dry spent fuel transportation and storage cask: conduction, radiation, and convection. The methodologies for predicting the first two mechanisms in both the COBRA-SFS/RADGEN codes and the MIT Method are studied and compared. Conduction length factors are determined as those values which result in COBRA-SFS calculations generating the same peak clad temperatures for the same heat conduction problem as the MIT effective conductivity method. The functional dependence of these factors on pitch to diameter and wall to diameter ratios, fill gas and bundle size are derived theoretically.

40|$|The Risk-Informed Safety Margin Characterization (RISMC) pathway of the Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program is {{developing}} simulation-based methods and tools for analyzing safety margin from a modern perspective. [1] There are multiple definitions of 'margin. ' One class of definitions defines margin {{in terms of}} the distance between a point estimate of a given performance parameter (such as <b>peak</b> <b>clad</b> <b>temperature),</b> and a point-value acceptance criterion defined for that parameter (such as 2200 F). The present perspective on margin is that it relates to the probability of failure, and not just the distance between a nominal operating point and a criterion. In this work, margin is characterized through a probabilistic analysis of the 'loads' imposed on systems, structures, and components, and their 'capacity' to resist those loads without failing. Given the probabilistic load and capacity spectra, one can assess the probability that load exceeds capacity, leading to component failure. Within the project, we refer to a plot of these probabilistic spectra as 'the logo. ' Refer to Figure 1 for a notional illustration. The implications of referring to 'the logo' are (1) RISMC is focused on being able to analyze loads and spectra probabilistically, and (2) calling it 'the logo' tacitly acknowledges that it is a highly simplified picture: meaningful analysis of a given component failure mode may require development of probabilistic spectra for multiple physical parameters, and in many practical cases, 'load' and 'capacity' will not vary independently...|$|E

40|$|A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) {{model is}} used in {{conjunction}} with the alternating conditional expectation (ACE) regression method to analyze the risk associated with the loss of feedwater accident coupled with a subsequent initiation of the feed and bleed operation in the Zion- 1 nuclear power plant. The use of the DBN allows the joint probability distribution to be factorized, enabling the analysis to be done on many simpler network structures rather than on one complicated structure. The construction of the DBN model assumes conditional independence relations among certain key reactor parameters. The choice of parameter to model is based on considerations of the macroscopic balance statements governing the behavior of the reactor under a quasi-static assumption. The DBN is used to relate the <b>peak</b> <b>clad</b> <b>temperature</b> to a set of independent variables that are known to be important in determining the success of the feed and bleed operation. A simple linear relationship is then used to relate the clad temperature to the core damage probability. 	To obtain a quantitative relationship among different nodes in the DBN, surrogates of the RELAP 5 reactor transient analysis code are used. These surrogates are generated by applying the ACE algorithm to output data obtained from about 50 RELAP 5 cases covering a wide range of the selected independent variables. These surrogates allow important safety parameters such as the fuel clad temperature to be expressed as a function of key reactor parameters such as the coolant temperature and pressure together with important independent variables such as the scram delay time. The time-dependent core damage probability is calculated by sampling the independent variables from their probability distributions and propagate the information up through the Bayesian network to give the clad temperature. With the knowledge of the clad temperature and the assumption that the core damage probability has a one-to-one relationship to it, we have calculated the core damage probably as a function of transient time. The use of the DBN model in combination with ACE allows risk analysis to be performed with much less effort than if the analysis were done using the standard techniques...|$|E

A RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2 model of a VVER- 1000 /MODEL V 320 nuclear power plant, Balakovo Unit 4, was updated, improved and validated on the basis of an input deck prepared by the Kurchatov Institute of Moscow. The RELAP 5 model includes both the primary and the secondary systems. The Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) is modeled according to the plant configuration. The feedwater system, along with the emergency feedwater system, is included in the model. The point reactor kinetics model, in which the decay heat is calculated with ANS decay heat data, enables the model to be used for analysis of a large spectrum of transients and accidents. The plant model is used for analysis and prediction of a cold leg Large Break Loss-of-Coolant Accident (LBLOCA). The RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2 results showed a good agreement with calculations obtained with TECH-M computer program. The <b>cladding</b> <b>temperatures</b> of the MOX assembly have been compared with that of the hot UO? assembly. The <b>peak</b> <b>cladding</b> <b>temperature</b> of MOX assembly is about 55 K higher than that of UO? assembly. An uncertainty analysis has been performed for the <b>peak</b> <b>cladding</b> <b>temperature,</b> in which Monte Carlo calculations have been performed using the response surface built up from fifteen sets of RELAP 5 calculations. The result shows that the ECCS would be sufficient to keep the <b>cladding</b> <b>temperature</b> during the scenario of a LBLOCA well below the required licensing limit...|$|R

40|$|Nine {{boil-off}} {{experiments were}} conducted in the Swiss NEPTUN Facility primarily to obtain experimental data for assessing the perturbation effects of LOFT thermocouples during simulated small-break core uncovery conditions. The data will also be useful in assessing computer model capability to predict thermal hydraulic response data {{for this type of}} experiment. System parameters that were varied for these experiments included heater rod power, system pressure, and initial coolant subcooling. The experiments showed that the LOFT thermocouples do not cause a significant cooling influence in the rods to which they are attached. Furthermore, the accuracy of the LOFT thermocouples is within 20 K at the <b>peak</b> <b>cladding</b> <b>temperature</b> zone...|$|R

Nevertheless, large efforts are necessary for the qualification and the assessment of such codes. The aim of this work is to study the main phenomena involved in the emergency spray cooling injection in a Swedish-designed BWR. For this purpose, data from the Swedish separate effect test facility GÖTA have been simulated using TRACE version 5. 0 Patch 2. Furthermore, uncertainty calculations have been performed with the propagation of input errors method, and the identification of the input parameters that mostly influence the <b>peak</b> <b>cladding</b> <b>temperature</b> has been performed...|$|R
