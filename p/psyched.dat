40|$|In this paper, I discuss Psychological Verb constructions in American Sign Language (ASL). In particular, I will {{detail the}} ASL constructions {{associated}} with both uncaused psychological (<b>psych)</b> events and caused <b>psych</b> events. Uncaused <b>psych</b> events in ASL are expressed using transitive <b>psych</b> verbs, such as love, enjoy, pity. In these sentences, the grammatical {{subject of the}} sentence is the experiencer (Experiencer Subject- ES) of the emotion, and the grammatical object is the target of that emotion. Importantly, the grammatical object is not assumed to {{have a role in}} causing the <b>psych</b> event. ASL research has widely assumed that ASL does not allow <b>psych</b> verb constructions in which the grammatical object of the sentence is the thematic experiencer (Experiencer Object- EO) of the <b>psych</b> event (Kegl, 1990 2 ̆ 6 Meir et al, 2007). This research supports that conclusion, and develops it further by attempting to discover how ASL does encode for caused <b>psych</b> events. The result is that caused <b>psych</b> events in ASL appear to be expressed using intransitive <b>psych</b> verbs, such as embarrass, surprise, inspire. This analysis suggests that the ASL expression of these caused <b>psych</b> events is biclausal, and that the causer may in fact best be labeled as a causing event. Expanding on Ramchand 2 ̆ 7 s Event Structure Analysis, I introduce a proposed new structure to account for a commonly attested word order in intransitive caused <b>psych</b> events in ASL. Further, in order to fully describe the structure of the intransitive <b>psych</b> verbs, I also suggest the presence of light verbs in ASL. Specific to this paper, I focus on the potential ASL light verb LOOK-AT. This light verb occurs frequently in the unmarked sentence structures expressing caused <b>psych</b> events, and appears to {{play a key role in}} linking of the causing event and the caused <b>psych</b> event. The experimental method I used is an online survey with embedded videos. I also cite examples from a pilot study in which a Deaf informant frequently produced this caused <b>psych</b> event structure when presented with a translation task involving English EO sentences...|$|R

I remember hitting a couple of batters, and the bases were loaded two or three times. The ball was small sometimes, the ball was large sometimes, sometimes I saw the catcher, sometimes I didn't. Sometimes, I tried to stare the hitter down and throw while I was looking at him. I chewed my gum until it turned to powder. I started having a crazy idea in the fourth inning that Richard Nixon was the home plate umpire, and once I thought I was pitching a baseball to Jimi Hendrix, who to me was holding a guitar and swinging it over the plate. They say I had about three to four fielding chances. I remember diving {{out of the way of}} a ball I thought was a line drive. I jumped, but the ball wasn't hit hard and never reached me.|$|E

He stated that the team was [...] "trying to go with the same philosophy" [...] as the company's earlier games, in that they would [...] "develop the systems and the game would come out of it". However, the team's development priorities regularly changed, and the programmer who led the project left several years into production.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the thesis is to provide each student with an {{intensive}} apprenticeship in psychological research. In the process of collaborating with faculty, students are expected to acquire (sharpen) the skills required for conducting and presenting research. These skills include library research, writing, public speaking, designing experiments, as well as collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. These skills are useful tools for life, regardless of the career path each student chooses. Beginning September 2005, the Psychology Department will offer two thesis courses – <b>Psych</b> 4 D 09, Senior Honours Thesis, and <b>Psych</b> 4 D 06, Senior Thesis. The major differences are: (i) <b>Psych</b> 4 D 09 has a pre-requisite of a C. A. of at least 8. 5; (ii) <b>Psych</b> 4 D 09 requires an internal (faculty in the Department of Psychology) supervisor or co-supervisor. For co-supervisor status, you must have made arrangements with both the internal and external supervisors for the collaboration; (iii) <b>Psych</b> 4 D 09 requires participation in the end-of-the-year in-house undergraduate thesis conference; (iv) and <b>Psych</b> 4 D 09 requires 3 units of additional work which can be taken in Term 1 or Term 2. (This will often be determined by the type of research involved). It will be up to the supervisor to determine whether the thesis project involves 9 units (4 D 09) or 6 units (4 D 06) of work.

The supervillains, especially Dr. Impossible, are portrayed as sympathetic characters afflicted with [...] "Malign Hypercognition Disorder", a psychological condition which makes highly intelligent people use their advantages to perform non-virtuous, or evil, actions.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} second {{language}} acquisition of English <b>psych</b> predicates by Chinese-speaking and French-speaking adult learners of English within the Government and Binding Theory. Two major parts comprise the whole work: {{a study of}} <b>psych</b> predicates across Chinese, English and French, including verbs like blame and annoy, adjectives such as annoying and annoyed, and nominals like annoyance; and an experiment on Chinese and French learners' knowledge of English <b>psych</b> predicates. An account of <b>psych</b> predicates is proposed, under which Experiencer Object (EO) verbs are the causatives of Experiencer Subject (ES) verbs, derived by zero affixation. Different D-structures are suggested for the two classes of verbs, solving the linking problem of <b>psych</b> predicates. The binding problem with EO verbs and corresponding -ing adjectives is resolved by the assumption of anaphoric pro, which enables the anaphor to be bound backwards by the antecedent through the extension of chain-binding theory. The Target/Subject Matter (T/SM) restriction is ruled out by a generalization established on {{the interaction of the}} zero CAUS and selectional restrictions. Given the linguistic analysis that EO verbs are made up of a zero CAUS and a root, and the fact that <b>psych</b> adjectives and <b>psych</b> nominals are derived from these verbs, the central hypothesis for the L 2 acquisition of English <b>psych</b> predicates hinges on this zero CAUS. It is predicted that if L 2 learners of English have difficulty figuring out the causative nature of EO verbs and -ing adjectives, they should have difficulty recognizing the correct argument structure, the ungrammaticality of T/SM violations and the grammaticality of backwards binding with these predicates. A picture identification task, a multiple choice task and a grammaticality judgment and correction task are designed to test L 2 learners' knowledge of these properties. The results obtained through the experiment are discussed with respect to the issues in second language acquisition...|$|R
40|$|The special {{properties}} that psych(ological) verbs manifest cross-linguistically have {{given rise to}} on-going debates in syntactic and semantic theorizing. Regarding their lexical aspect classification, while verbal <b>psych</b> predicates with the Experiencer argument mapped onto the subject (SE <b>psych</b> predicates) have generally been analyzed as stative, there is little agreement on what kinds of eventualities object Experiencer (OE) <b>psych</b> predicates describe. On the stative reading, OE <b>psych</b> predicates have been classified as atelic causative states. On the (non-agentive) eventive reading, they have been widely analyzed as telic change of state predicates and classified as achievements or as accomplishments. Based on Polish, Rozwadowska (2003, 2012) argues that nonagentive eventive OE <b>psych</b> predicates in the perfective aspect denote an onset of a state and that they are atelic rather than telic. This paper offers further support for the view that Polish perfective <b>psych</b> verbs do not denote a change of state, i. e., a transition from α to ¬α. The evidence is drawn from verbal comparison and the distribution of the comparative degree quantifier jeszcze bardziej ‘even more’ in perfective <b>psych</b> predicates. It is argued here that in contexts including jeszcze bardziej ‘even more’, the perfective predication denotes an onset of a state whose degree of intensity exceeds the comparative standard. While a degree quantifier attached to the VP in the syntax contributes a differential measure function that returns a (vague) value representing {{the degree to which the}} intensity of the Experiencer’s state exceeds the comparative standard in the event, it does not affect the event structure of the perfective verb and it does not provide the VP denotation it modifies with a final endpoint. As the perfective picks the onset of an upper open state, perfective <b>psych</b> predicates typically give rise to an atelic interpretation...|$|R
