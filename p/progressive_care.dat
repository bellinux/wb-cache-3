40|$|Aim of {{this article}} is to review the {{literature}} about the <b>Progressive</b> Patient <b>Care</b> Model, in particular its conceptual and practical characteristics, its implementation and effects on the current health care organization. Was conducted by an integrative-narrative literature review. The <b>Progressive</b> Patient <b>Care</b> is a model which aims at group patients according to their complexity in order to place patients in the most appropriate care setting. The original model consists on five care levels: intensive care, intermediate care, self-care, long term care, home care. In Italy the above mentioned model can be considered as a contextualization of <b>Progressive</b> Patient <b>Care</b> in the light of similarities both in terms of model purposes and care levels classification. The organization for intensive care levels is an opportunity for Italian healthcare facilities to reach continuity of care. This model emphazises care processes looking to patients' needs rather than a division according to criteria of specialties...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} {{a study of the}} use of {{intermediate}} care beds in the intermediate care facility (ICF) of the Yale Health Plan, a prepaid group practice plan for students and an enrolled non-student population, indicate that the ICF may be a possible model for other health maintenance organizations. The ICF, with 30 beds in active use, is located in the Yale health center. Approximately one-third of the ICF patients would have been admitted to the affiliated short-term general hospital if the ICF did not exist. The plan's medical staff also has the option of transferring patients between the affiliated hospital and the ICF, depending on which institution is most appropriate for the patient's needs. A comparison of the levels of care provided in the ICF with those presented in selected articles from the <b>progressive</b> patient <b>care</b> literature revealed that the ICF is not only providing intermediate care but several other classic elements of <b>progressive</b> patient <b>care</b> -self care, continuing care, minimal care, and partial care...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{functions}} of health care systems is to collect enough revenue to finance health expenditures. This revenue can be obtained through different sources (taxes, social insurance contributions, out-of-pocket payments, donations), {{each of which has}} different implications in terms of equity. The equity implications of the different forms of revenue collection are an important component of health systems performance evaluation. The international evidence suggests that tax funded systems seem to be a more <b>progressive</b> health <b>care</b> financing mechanism than systems based on social insurance in low- and middle-income countries. However, progressivity results are sensitive to the choice of ability to pay measures and, therefore, policy makers must be aware of this fact when interpreting results of studies on health care financing...|$|R
