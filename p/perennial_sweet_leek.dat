40|$|The {{species of}} the genus Orius Wolff are {{well-known}} as generalist predators able to control thrips outbreaks worldwide. In 2005 Orius species were collected on different crops (bean, sweet pepper in greenhouses and in the open field, strawberry, <b>sweet</b> <b>leek),</b> located in typical horticultural areas of Piedmont (NW Italy). During the growing season Orius species were also sampled on the wild flora in the surroundings of pepper greenhouses, to assess the natural host plants alternative to the crop in the investigated area. The adult anthocorids were then identified examining the genital clasper in males and the copulatory tube in females. During field surveys, three Orius species were sampled on crops and wild flora: Orius majusculus (Reuter), Orius minutus (L.), and Orius niger (Wolff). O. niger occurred on almost all the sampled plant species, while O. majusculus prevailed on vegetables {{even if it was}} rarely collected on wild flora. Both of them seem to be good candidates for thrips control in horticultural areas of northwest-ern Italy. On the contrary O. minutus was generally observed in a scarce quantity, except on bean...|$|R

The reliability of the system was also a leverage for small business activities. For example, one of the beneficiaries improved the trade of meat thanks to the better and cheaper means of preservation compared to buying ice every day.|$|R

There is huge pastureland and grassland and there is great potentiality of animal husbandry. Thatch house is famous in olden days and Koide village is well known for good quality of thatch for roofing house. In olden days, some of the neighboring villages like Oinam and Purul used to come and take thatch (Ngaiche) from Koide village for roofing house.|$|R

An exception to this is mint, which should be harvested at full bloom. Harvest the herbs parsley, lovage, winter savory, and salad burnet early while leaves are still tender. Harvest {{early in the morning}} because oils evaporate {{in the heat of the}} day. For annuals, leave some leafy growth so the plant can produce new growth for a later harvest. For tender <b>perennials</b> (rosemary, <b>sweet</b> marjoram) cut a few inches off the tip of the branch to encourage new growth.

The well has a <b>perennial</b> source of <b>sweet</b> water, which is remarkable as most of the water in the area is brackish owing to the proximity to the Arabian Sea.

5000|$|In calorie farming, care {{is given}} to growing enough food energy (and other {{nutrients}}) to live on in a minimal area. Root crops are often used in calorie farming because they allow biointensive farmers and gardeners to grow more nutrients in smaller areas, resulting in less labor per calorie, and more space for wilderness and other people. These crops—which have both a high calorie content per pound, and a high yield per area—include potatoes, <b>sweet</b> potatoes, garlic, <b>leeks,</b> burdock, Jerusalem artichoke and parsnips. These crops can produce as much as 5 to 20 times the calories per unit of area per unit of time. In biointensive farming, 30% of the land cultivated for food is used for root crops.|$|R
40|$|Stevia rebaudiana is a <b>sweet</b> <b>perennial</b> herb {{which has}} been widely {{cultivated}} through {{the world for the}} sweet diterpene glycosides. S. rebaudiana has been applied as substitutes for sucrose, for treatment of diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension and caries prevention. Among the diterpene glycoside, rebaudioside A showed the lowest bitterness and the taste is close to sucrose. In this study two varieties MSR 012 and MSR 007 obtained from MARDI, Bachok, Kelantan were studied to maximize the yield of rebaudioside A from S. rebaudiana grown on BRIS soil. In order to find the best harvesting time of S. rebaudiana, proximate analysis were done on S. rebaudiana leaves from different maturity stage, i. e., before flowering (30 - 35 days), flowering time (50 - 60 days) & over mature (70 - 90 days) of new apical stem grown on 2 year old plant. Separation method by solvent extraction followed by crystallization and re- crystallization of rebaudioside A in amorphous form were done in order to obtain sweetener which consist mainly bioactive compound, rebaudioside A. Moisture, ash, reducing sugar, non-reducing sugar and total carbohydrate were found maximum in variety MSR 007 before flowering stage with 8. 45 %, 7. 17 %, 4. 45 %, 8. 45 %, and 13. 65 % respectively. Percentages of rebaudioside A were found maximum just before flowering stage with 3. 45 % followed by over matured stage with 2. 20 % and during flowering time with 1. 82 %...|$|R
40|$|Landless villagers in North-west Bangladesh {{are using}} {{roadside}} verges and other wasteland areas for agroforestry. One kilometre of roadside plantation is giving villagers a net profit of about $ 200 per year. Proshika Manobik Unnayan Kendra, a Bangladeshi NGO, is helping groups of landless people to invest {{part of their}} savings in agroforestry and has smoothed the way with adjoining landowners and the local administration. Proshika groups have selected three main species of trees for roadside agroforestry: Acacia nilotica, mahogany and mulberry. Six months after planting, mulberry leaves can be harvested for sericulture, while A. nilotica is ready {{in little more than}} a year for timber and thinnings can be harvested for firewood and fodder earlier. The mahogany is a longer-term, high-value timber tree. Under the trees the villagers have planted <b>perennial</b> pigeon pea, <b>sweet</b> pumpkin, turmeric and sungrass for thatching. In one locality, Proshika has obtained five-year leases from the local administration for about 80 km of roadsides. However, it is still not certain whether the local council will agree to trees being cut down in the long term. So, until long-term tenure can be secured, people are reluctant to participate on a larger scale. Despite this agroforestry offers short-term benefits that conventional forestry is unable to do.
