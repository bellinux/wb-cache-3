5|$|In Major League Baseball, the 300win club is {{the group}} of <b>pitchers</b> who have won 300 or more games. Twenty-four <b>pitchers</b> have reached this milestone. The New York Gothams/Giants/San Francisco Giants are the only {{franchise}} to see four players reach the milestone while on their roster: those players are Tim Keefe, Mickey Welch, Christy Mathewson, and Randy Johnson. Early {{in the history of}} professional baseball, many of the rules favored the pitcher over the batter; the distance <b>pitchers</b> threw to home plate was shorter than today, and <b>pitchers</b> were able to use foreign substances to alter the direction of the ball. The first player to win 300games was Pud Galvin in 1888. Seven <b>pitchers</b> recorded all or the majority of their career wins in the 19thcentury: Galvin, Cy Young, Kid Nichols, Tim Keefe, John Clarkson, Charley Radbourn, and Mickey Welch. Four more <b>pitchers</b> joined the club {{in the first quarter of}} the 20thcentury: Christy Mathewson, Walter Johnson, Eddie Plank, and Grover Cleveland Alexander. Young is the all-time leader in wins with 511, a mark that is considered unbreakable. If a modern-day pitcher won 20 games per season for 25 seasons, he would still be 11 games short of Young's mark.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} for a <b>pitcher</b> to record a shutout without starting the game or pitching a complete game, so long as all the outs in the game are recorded under the same <b>pitcher</b> with no opposing runs scored by the other team.

5|$|Among {{the many}} other {{statistics}} that are kept are those collectively known as situational statistics.
