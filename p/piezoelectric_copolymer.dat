40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} (AE) sensors {{have been}} fabricated using polarized polyvinylidene fluoride/trifluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE)) <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>copolymer</b> films. The acoustic and electromechanical {{properties of the}} copolymers have been determined using the ultrasonic immersion technique and the resonance technique, respectively. The P(VDF-TrFE) AE sensors have been calibrated according to the ASTM standard and evaluated for potential application in the detection of AE in glass fiber reinforced polypropylene (GFPP). A ceramic AE sensor also has been fabricated using lead zirconate titanate (PZT) 7 A piezoelectric ceramic and its sensitivity and performance are reported as well. The copolymer sensors do not show resonance peaks of the ceramic sensor and have adequate sensitivity. They can reproduce AE signals accurately without giving artifacts and have potential use in commercial AE systems. Department of Applied Physic...|$|E

ABSTRACT: A comprehensive theory for sensing deflections in helical compression springs and multi-leaf curved bar springs using <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>copolymer</b> film is developed and presented. This sensing capability {{is applied to}} the problem of sensing ground roughness in adaptive damping vehic-ular suspensions. A computer simulation of a vehicle equipped with an adaptive suspension system incorporating spring deflection sensors which is traveling over randomly rough surface is performed using MATLABâ€™s SIMULINK module. A new algorithm for processing the sensor output and adapt-ing the damping force to road conditions is presented and shown to be insensitive to sensor noise. The control algorithm is realized in SIMULINK, and the surface is simulated by a specifically designed random signal. The adaptive damping is shown to dramatically reduce inertial forces act-ing on the vehicle during travel over rough surfaces...|$|E
40|$|In gait analysis, {{there is}} growing {{awareness}} of the need to simultaneously measure shear and vertical forces for the diagnosis and treatment assessment of pathological foot disorders. This is especially the case in the measurement of the forces between the plantar surface of the foot and the shoe. Although clinical {{awareness of the need}} to simultaneously measure shear and vertical forces under the foot has increased little has been done to provide the technology. This is mainly due to the difficulty in constructing devices capable of carrying out this task in the in-shoe environment. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe the development and characteristics of a miniature triaxial transducer measuring 10 10 2. 7 mm and a weight of only 2 g. This transducer is capable of simultaneously measuring three orthogonal forces under any location of the plantar surface of the foot utilizing a single element <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>copolymer</b> P(VDF-TrFE). Transducer sensitivity, linearity, hysteresis, cross-talk and temperature dependence is presented. As well as in-shoe force measurement, this triaxial transducer could have other biomedical and general engineering applications, e. g., prosthetic interface forces, handgrip forces, sport, robotics, etc...|$|E

40|$|In the poling {{studies of}} lead {{zirconate}} titanate/polyvinylidene fluoride /trifluoroethylene (PZT/P(VDF-TrFE)) 0 - 3 composites, the resistivity of the <b>piezoelectric</b> P(VDF-TrFE) <b>copolymer</b> matrix {{plays an important}} role in determining the electric field experienced by each phase of the composites. We have recently reported the existence of thermal hysteresis in the resistivity of the 68 / 32 P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer supplied by North America Atochem. The thermal hysteresis behaviour of the copolymer depends on the composition and the supplier. In the present study, resistivity measurements on copolymers with different compositions from two suppliers are presented and their implications on the poling of 0 - 3 composites are discussed.

40|$|Micro (MEMS) and Nanotechnologies for Defense and Security, Orlando, FL, 10 - 12 April 2007 Piezoelectric micromachined {{ultrasonic}} transducer (pMUT) consisting of a piezoelectric capacitor built on a micromachined silicon membrane {{has been used for}} ultrasound transmitting and sensing. It typically operates at the fundamental flexural vibration frequency, where maximum sensitivity can be achieved, and is insensitive at higher order of resonances because the harmonic signals generated from different parts of the diaphragm tend to cancel with each other. This leads to a very narrow bandwidth. In this paper, rectangular-shaped pMUTs for dual-frequency application are proposed and fabricated using <b>piezoelectric</b> P(VDF-TrFE) <b>copolymer</b> coating and silicon micromachining technologies. The electrode patterns are properly designed to efficiently make use of both (0, 0) and (2, 0) vibration modes of the rectangular membrane. By adjusting the length and width of the diaphragm, the ratio of the two frequencies can be varied on demand within a wide range. The corresponding design principles are also useful for other micromachined devices such as surface acoustic wave devices, delay lines, resonators, etc. Department of Applied PhysicsRefereed conference pape...|$|R
40|$|A polymer-based {{uniaxial}} accelerometer with <b>piezoelectric</b> polyvinylidene fluoride <b>copolymer</b> (P(VDF-TrFE)) transducers and micro injection molded polypropylene (PP) structures has been designed, manufactured and characterized. The mass-loaded cantilever structure shows a quasi-static charge sensitivity of 0. 69 pC/g and a resonance frequency of 735 Hz. Because of its efficient processing and its small dimensions the polymer-based sensor (polySENS) {{can be integrated}} into polymer-based compound structures {{in order to measure}} low-frequency vibrations. The focus of this contribution is on the design, processing {{as well as on the}} characterization of the polySENS accelerometer to determine the sensor properties of the accelerometer due to manufacturing particularities. Additionally, investigations regarding the applied materials and the manufacturing, in particular the mold filling have been done to qualify the novel technological approach...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} carried out {{on the effect of}} {{processing}} conditions including preparation methods, ultrasonication, film thickness, and thermal annealing on the thermal, mechanical, and <b>piezoelectric</b> properties of <b>copolymer</b> of poly(vinylidene difluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)). Free-standing films and films on substrates are prepared by solvent casting and spin-coating, respectively. The results obtained by differential scanning calorimetry show that the Curie transition of the copolymer films was influenced by the preparation methods, with very little difference in the melting transition. The difference was attributed to a less uniform distribution of TrFE comonomer units within the crystalline and amorphous regions of the spin-coating films. However, no effect of the preparation methods on the piezoelectric properties of the films was observed. It is also found that the short ultrasonication, film thickness higher than critical value of crystallization of P(VDF-TrFE) (about 100 nm), and drying before annealing did not {{have a significant effect on}} the properties of the films. Surprisingly, the ultrasonication had a clear impact on the relaxations at high temperature of the polymer chains. In addition, this study indicates that a short annealing by 10 min at 140 degrees C was enough to obtain well-crystallized films, which is interesting from the industrial point of view...|$|R
