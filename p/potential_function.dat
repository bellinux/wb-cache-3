25|$|The <b>potential</b> <b>function</b> is {{a useful}} tool to analyze {{equilibrium}} properties of games, since the incentives of all players are mapped into one function, and the set of pure Nash equilibria can be found by locating the local optima of the <b>potential</b> <b>function.</b> Convergence and finite-time convergence of an iterated game towards a Nash equilibrium can also be understood by studying the <b>potential</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} a scalar valued fitness {{function}} f(s) also corresponds to the {{concept of a}} potential or energy function in physics. The two concepts only differ in that physicists traditionally think in terms of minimizing the <b>potential</b> <b>function,</b> while biologists prefer the notion that fitness is being maximized. Therefore, taking the inverse of a <b>potential</b> <b>function</b> turns it into a fitness function, and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|The {{properties}} of {{several types of}} potential games have since been studied. Games can be either ordinal or cardinal potential games. In cardinal games, the difference in individual payoffs for each player from individually changing one's strategy ceteris paribus has {{to have the same}} value as the difference in values for the <b>potential</b> <b>function.</b> In ordinal games, only the signs of the differences have to be the same.|$|E
25|$|A {{molecular}} dynamics simulation requires {{the definition of a}} <b>potential</b> <b>function,</b> or a description of the terms by which the particles in the simulation will interact. In chemistry and biology this is usually referred to as a force field and in materials physics as an interatomic potential. Potentials may be defined at many levels of physical accuracy; those most commonly used in chemistry are based on molecular mechanics and embody a classical mechanics treatment of particle-particle interactions that can reproduce structural and conformational changes but usually cannot reproduce chemical reactions.|$|E
25|$|A hyperelastic {{material}} {{is a special}} case of a Cauchy elastic material in which the stress at any point is objective and determined only by {{the current state of}} deformation with respect to an arbitrary reference configuration (for more details on deformation see also the pages Deformation (mechanics) and Finite strain). However, the work done by the stresses may depend on the path the deformation takes. Therefore, a Cauchy elastic material has a non-conservative structure, and the stress cannot be derived from a scalar elastic <b>potential</b> <b>function.</b> The special case of Cauchy elastic materials where the work done by the stresses is independent of the path of deformation is referred to as a Green elastic or hyperelastic material. Such materials are conservative and the stresses in the material can be derived by a scalar elastic potential, more commonly known as the Strain energy density function.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Several {{formulations}} {{based on}} Random Fields (RFs) {{have been proposed}} for joint categorization and segmentation (JCaS) of ob-jects in images. The RF’s sites correspond to pixels or superpixels of an image and one defines <b>potential</b> <b>functions</b> (typically over local neighbor-hoods) which define costs for the different possible assignments of labels to several different sites. Since the segmentation is unknown a priori, one cannot define <b>potential</b> <b>functions</b> over arbitrarily large neighborhoods as that may cross object boundaries. Categorization algorithms extract a set of interest points from the entire image and solve the categorization prob-lem by optimizing cost functions that depend on the feature descriptors extracted from these interest points. There is some disconnect between segmentation algorithms which consider local neighborhoods and cate-gorization algorithms which consider non-local neighborhoods. In this work, we propose to {{bridge this gap by}} introducing a novel formulation which uses models of objects with deformable parts, classically used for object categorization, to solve the JCaS problem. We use these models to introduce two new classes of <b>potential</b> <b>functions</b> for JCaS; (a) the first class of <b>potential</b> <b>functions</b> encodes the model score for detecting an object as a function of its visible parts only, and (b) the second class of <b>potential</b> <b>functions</b> encodes shape priors for each visible part and is used to bias the segmentation of the pixels in the support region of the part, towards the foreground object label. We show that most existing deformable parts formulations can be used to define these potential func-tions and that the resulting <b>potential</b> <b>functions</b> can be optimized exactly using min-cut. As a result, these new <b>potential</b> <b>functions</b> can be inte-grated with most existing RF-based formulations for JCaS. ...|$|R
