5|$|Beginning in 1970, {{a series}} of {{expansions}} were added to Ainsworth's original patterns. They include the following: B4 (1970), A/C (1985) D/disorganized (1986), B5 (1988, 1992) A+, C+, & Depressed (1992, 2010). At later ages, additional categories have been described. Each of these patterns reflects {{a different kind of}} attachment relationship of the infant with the mother/caregiver. An infant may have a different pattern of attachment to each parent as well as to alternate caregivers. Pattern of attachment is thus {{not a part of the}} infant, but is characteristic of the protective and comforting quality of a specific relationship. These attachment patterns are associated with behavioral patterns and can help further <b>predict</b> <b>a</b> child's future personality.|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: Presently, {{there is}} much {{interest}} in how students study and what skills best facilitate their academic performance. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine how students’ conceptions of knowledge, approaches to learning, and personality relate to academic success. An online survey was completed by 198 first-year tertiary students, including 116 off-campus psychology students. This paper will report the relationships among the key variables. As expected, Quick Learning and Simple Knowledge variables positively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Surface learning approach. In contrast, Innate Ability, Simple Knowledge, and Certain Knowledge variables negatively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Deep learning approach. Innate Ability negatively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Strategic learning approach. However, students’ conceptions of knowledge did not <b>predict</b> academic success. <b>As</b> expected, students who adopted a Surface learning approach experienced lower academic success. Contrary to expectations, however, Deep and Strategic learning approaches did not positively predict academic success. An interesting finding was that Intellect positively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Deep learning approach. Further, Conscientiousness, Intellect, and Emotional Stability positively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Strategic learning approach and negatively <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> Surface learning approach. Personality also predicted academic success. Neuroticism negatively predicted academic success; Conscientiousness positively predicted academic success. The implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Due to a weak mid-level {{anticyclone}} {{over the}} Gulf of Mexico {{that was not}} observed operationally, Mitch began a slow southerly motion on October27, passing very near Guanaja. The NHC had anticipated the movement {{to be part of}} a small loop in the Gulf of Honduras, although the agency noted continued uncertainty. Steadily deteriorating, Mitch weakened below major hurricane intensity late on October28, due to land interaction, upwelling, and possibly an eyewall replacement cycle. On October29, the hurricane made landfall in Honduras, east of La Ceiba, with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Despite being over land, the NHC continued to <b>predict</b> <b>a</b> turn to the north, which would allow for restrengthening.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Gloucestershire in August 1920.

He spent the winter working on a farm on the Isle of Wight, then moved to Bristol {{for the start of}} the 1921 English cricket season. Playing only two first-class matches in 1921, both against the powerful Australian tourists, Hammond scored two runs in three innings, overwhelmed by fast bowler Jack Gregory. In between these games, Gloucestershire arranged his appointment as assistant coach at Clifton College, Bristol, where he worked on his batting technique with former county cricketers John Tunnicliffe and George Dennett.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Einstein {{applied the}} {{general theory of}} {{relativity}} to the structure of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to <b>predict</b> <b>a</b> static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.|$|E

5|$|Lili posed {{a threat}} to Bermuda, and a {{hurricane}} warning as the storm approached, but only gusty winds and light rainfall was reported. As Lili continued westward, it had also posed a significant threat to the East Coast of the United States, since some of the computer models did not <b>predict</b> <b>a</b> northward curve. As a result, several hurricane watches and warnings were issued from Little River Inlet, South Carolina, to Cape Henlopen, Delaware. However, Lili later curved northward, and only caused minor coastal erosion in North Carolina and rainfall in Pennsylvania. Lili began impacting Atlantic Canada as it was transitioning an extratropical cyclone, and the storm reportedly caused strong winds in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. No damage total or fatalities were reported.|$|E
5|$|Nucleic acid {{design has}} similar goals to protein design. In both, the {{sequence}} of monomers is designed to favor the desired target structure and to disfavor other structures. Nucleic acid design {{has the advantage of}} being much computationally easier than protein design, because the simple base pairing rules are sufficient to <b>predict</b> <b>a</b> structure's energetic favorability, and detailed information about the overall three-dimensional folding of the structure is not required. This allows the use of simple heuristic methods that yield experimentally robust designs. Nucleic acid structures are less versatile than proteins in their function because of proteins' increased ability to fold into complex structures, and the limited chemical diversity of the four nucleotides as compared to the twenty proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is stable once formed and will {{continue}} to cool almost indefinitely, eventually to become a black dwarf. Assuming that the Universe continues to expand, it is thought that in 1019 to 1020 years, the galaxies will evaporate as their stars escape into intergalactic space.,§IIIA. White dwarfs should generally survive galactic dispersion, although an occasional collision between white dwarfs may produce a new fusing star or a super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf which will explode in a Type Ia supernova.,§IIIC,IV. The subsequent lifetime of white dwarfs is thought to be on the order of the lifetime of the proton, known to be at least 1034–1035 years. Some grand unified theories <b>predict</b> <b>a</b> proton lifetime between 1030 and 1036 years. If these theories are not valid, the proton may decay by complicated nuclear reactions or through quantum gravitational processes involving a virtual black hole; in these cases, the lifetime is estimated to be no more than 10200 years. If protons do decay, the mass of a white dwarf will decrease very slowly with time as its nuclei decay, until it loses enough mass to become a nondegenerate lump of matter, and finally disappears completely.,§IV.|$|E

With Jay Cutler still out, Josh McCown continued to play as quarterback for the Bears, who had the eighth-best passing offense in the league with 261.7 yards per game, which competed against the Ravens' 18th-ranked pass defense. On the ground, the Ravens had the tenth-best rushing D with 102.6 rushing yards allowed per game, but offensively, had the 30th-ranked rushing offense, averaging just 73.1 yards per game, going against Chicago's defense which allowed 129.4 rushing yards per game.

5|$|Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a {{distributed}} computing project for disease research that simulates protein folding, computational drug design, {{and other types}} of molecular dynamics. The project uses the idle processing resources of thousands of personal computers owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. Its main purpose is to determine the mechanisms of protein folding, which is the process by which proteins reach their final three-dimensional structure, and to examine the causes of protein misfolding. This is of significant academic interest with major implications for medical research into Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and many forms of cancer, among other diseases. To a lesser extent, Folding@home also tries to <b>predict</b> <b>a</b> protein's final structure and determine how other molecules may interact with it, which has applications in drug design. Folding@home is developed and operated by the Pande Laboratory at Stanford University, under the direction of Prof. Vijay Pande, and is shared by various scientific institutions and research laboratories across the world.|$|E
