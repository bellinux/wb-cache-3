40|$|The {{effects of}} {{alternative}} traffic management possibilities on task performance and <b>pilot</b> <b>controller</b> verbal workloads were studied. Two new rule structures - sequencing and advisory - {{in addition to}} vectoring were studied in conjunction with CRT pilot displays incorporating traffic situation displays with and without aircraft flight path predictors. The sequencing and advisory systems gave increasing control responsibility to the pilots. It was concluded that distributed management systems could in practice significantly reduce controller verbal workload without reducing system performance. Implications of this conclusion suggest that distributed management would allow controllers to handle a larger volume of traffic safely either as a normal operating procedure or as a failure mode alternative in a highly automated ground centered system...|$|E

40|$|Pilot {{workload}} {{was examined}} during simulated flights requiring flight deck-based merging and spacing while avoiding weather. Pilots used flight deck tools to avoid convective weather and space behind a lead aircraft during an arrival into Louisville International airport. Three conflict avoidance management concepts were studied: <b>pilot,</b> <b>controller</b> or automation primarily responsible. A modified Air Traffic Workload Input Technique (ATWIT) metric showed highest workload during the approach phase of flight and lowest during the en-route phase of flight (before deviating for weather). In general, the modified ATWIT {{was shown to}} be a valid and reliable workload measure, providing more detailed information than post-run subjective workload metrics. The trend across multiple workload metrics revealed lowest workload when pilots had both conflict alerting and responsibility of the three concepts, while all objective and subjective measures showed highest workload when pilots had no conflict alerting or responsibility. This suggests that pilot workload was not tied primarily to responsibility for resolving conflicts, but to gaining and/or maintaining situation awareness when conflict alerting is unavailable...|$|E
40|$|A numeric {{simulation}} {{tool for}} simulating the winch launch of gliders has been realized and employed {{for a number}} of analyses. It comprises models of aircraft, pilot, winch, winch operator, cable, atmosphere and terrain. Results are in agreement with pilots' experience. The simulation framework is implemented in Matlab/Simulink. It is based on an existing flight dynamics simulation used e. g. to assess the application of actuators in sailplanes. Configuration has been kept fairly generic to allow modeling of different aircraft, winches, cables and conditions. A GUI allows easy change of parameters. The cable may be modeled either as a simple secant between winch and aircraft, where force variations along the cable are neglected. The alternative is a FEM representation with the cable separated into massless cylinder elements connecting mass points. This allows including aerodynamic forces acting on the cylinders and gravity acting on the mass points. The cylinders may also be assigned spring and damping constants to model elasticity effects. Finally, they also interact with the terrain. For the winch, an automotive drive train model was employed. The rotating parts act as a flywheel whose acceleration is determined by power input from the engine and power drain from the cable. Ground interaction is modeled for a set of discrete contact points including wheels, exposed structure elements like skids or wingtips and the cable elements. Each contact point has spring and damping constants to model the force normal to the terrain. Forces in the contact plane are calculated via friction coefficients. The humans in the loop are approximated by simple control elements, namely PID controllers. The winch operator controls the cable force at the winch using engine throttle. The glider pilot model is divided into three submodels controlling elevator, aileron and rudder. The elevator channel is responsible for airspeed, while bank angle (and thus heading rate) is controlled by aileron deflection. The objective of the rudder channel finally is to minimize the angle of sideslip. All <b>pilot</b> <b>controller</b> gains are scheduled by dynamic pressure. Human factors are included in terms of reaction time and neuromuscular delay. Analyses were carried out varying different simulation parameters like cable type, cable force, hook position, pilot behavior and wind influence. Results will be presented in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Within the DLR project flexiGuide, an {{operational}} concept {{was developed and}} validated for the transition from current operating procedures towards time based operations in the extended terminal manoeuvring area (E-TMA). This transition will be possible {{at some point in}} the future due to the evolution of aircraft equipment. With the help of simulations we show that using this advanced equipage and time based arrival management, an optimized traffic flow even at peak traffic times at larger airports can be implemented which cuts fuel consumption, flight time, and aircraft noise. The concept makes use of a combination of modern 4 D flight management systems, data link connections, optimized approach routes and procedures, and a broad sequence planning and trajectory negotiation support for arrival, departure, and ground controller. The need for transition concepts arises from the heterogeneous avionic capabilities of the global airliner fleet which stem from the gradual evolution of aircraft equipment in the past combined with different operational requirements of the aircraft operators. We think it is likely that the global airliner fleet will retain this heterogeneity for the foreseeable future, even if the equipment requirements set forth by the regulatory bodies would be changed to require advanced avionics capabilities. This makes the concept proposed in this paper even more valuable as a possible mid-term solution for flight guidance. In this paper, we give a broad overview over the flight guidance aspects that we worked on in the flexiGuide project: we present the route structure and the associated operational concept. Then, we discuss the necessary changes to the <b>pilot</b> <b>controller</b> interaction and implications for the controller assistance tools. A number of new concepts for human-machine interfaces are described as well as preliminary results of the validation trials of those concepts. As a conclusion, we present a detailed investigation of the environmental impact of the concept The concept makes use of on-board advanced 4 D navigation capabilities which are available on approximately three quarters of the global airliner fleet [2]. The trajectories and target times are calculated and optimized by a ground based controller support system and negotiated with the flying on-board systems by means of datalink, which is assumed to be available with a sufficient bandwidth. Results of preliminary investigations suggest that a discrete approach route structure with the associated operating concept and advanced support systems offers the possibility to save fuel and time for all aircraft fitted with 4 D-FMS irrespective of the percentage of 4 D aircraft in the overall traffic mix. An average fuel saving depending on aircraft type and traffic scenario between 90 and 900 kg and flight time cut in excess of one minute in average per flight seem possible under the traffic load of a larger hub airport...|$|E

40|$|Background: In 2012 the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare {{produced}} a report titled 'Dementia in Australia. '(2) The report {{noted that the}} number of people with dementia in Australia would reach almost 400, 000 by 2020. Australia is a jurisdiction which does not impose a mandatory retirement age for pilots. With an aging population it was hypothesized that conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD) were likely to be seen more commonly by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). It was decided that this was an appropriate time to retrospectively study the data held by CASA. Methods: An interrogation of CASA databases was undertaken. Data was produced comparing percentage of Class 1 certificate holders over 60 yr of age against time. A cohort of <b>pilots</b> and <b>controllers</b> with PD was identified. The history of the cases was reviewed. Results: The study confirms that the pilot population is aging in line with population trends. Over a period from 1992 to 2012, 22 cases of <b>pilots</b> and <b>controllers</b> with PD were identified. Discussion: The study confirmed that PD will be of increased relevance over the next decade. Gaps between policy and practice managing past cases were identified. Updated guidelines have been published aiming to address the deficiencies identified in the study.

40|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{progress in}} understanding human capabilities and limitations, incorporating human factors into aircraft design, operation, and certification, {{and the emergence}} of new technologies designed to reduce workload and enhance human performance in the system, most aviation accidents still involve human errors. Such errors occur as a direct or indirect result of untimely, inappropriate, or erroneous actions (or inactions) by apparently well-trained and experienced <b>pilots,</b> <b>controllers,</b> and maintainers. The field of human factors has solved many of the more tractable problems related to simple ergonomics, cockpit layout, symbology, and so on. We have learned much about the relationships between people and machines, but know less about how to form successful partnerships between humans and the information technologies that are beginning to {{play a central role in}} aviation. Significant changes envisioned in the structure of the airspace, pilots and controllers' roles and responsibilities, and air/ground technologies will require a similarly significant investment in human factors during the next few decades to ensure the effective integration of <b>pilots,</b> <b>controllers,</b> dispatchers, and maintainers into the new system. Many of the topics that will be addressed are not new because progress in crucial areas, such as eliminating human error, has been slow.

40|$|In {{the current}} air traffic {{management}} (ATM) system, pilots and air traffic controllers have well-established roles and responsibilities: pilots fly aircraft and are concerned with energy management, fuel efficiency, and passenger comfort; controllers separate aircraft and are concerned with safety and management of traffic flows. Despite having different goals and obligations, both groups {{must be able to}} effectively communicate and interact with each other for the ATM system to work. This interaction will become even more challenging as traffic volume increases dramatically in the near future. To accommodate this increase, by 2025 the national air transportation system in the U. S. will go through a transformation that will modernize the ATM system and make it safer, more effective, and more efficient. This new system, NextGen, will change how <b>pilots</b> and <b>controllers</b> perform their tasks by incorporating advanced technologies and employing new procedures.

40|$|In {{order to}} respond to the {{increasing}} demand on limited airspace system resources, a number of applications of information technology have been proposed, or are under investigation, to improve the efficiency, capacity and reliability of ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) operations. Much of the attention in advanced ATM technology has focused on advanced automation systems or decision aiding systems to improve the performance of individual <b>Pilots</b> or <b>Controllers.</b> However, the most significant overall potential for information technology appears to he in increasing the shared information between human agents such as <b>Pilots,</b> <b>Controllers</b> or between interacting Controllers or traffic flow managers. Examples of proposed shared information systems in the US include; <b>Controller</b> <b>Pilot</b> Databank Communication (CPDLC), Traffic Management Advisor (TMA); Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS); Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) and NAS Level Common Information Exchange. Air Traffic Management is fundamentally a human centered process consisting of the negotiation, execution and monitoring of contracts between human agents for the allocation of limited airspace, runway and airport surface resources. The decision processes within ATM tend to be Semistructured. Many of the routine elements in ATM decision making {{on the part of the}} <b>Controllers</b> or <b>Pilots</b> are well Structured and can be represented by well defined rules or procedures. However in disrupted conditions, the ATM decision processes are often Unstructured and cannot be reduced to a set of discrete rules. As a consequence, the ability to automate ATM processes will be limited and ATM will continue to be a human centric process where the responsibility and the authority for the negotiation will continue to rest with human <b>Controllers</b> and <b>Pilots.</b> The use of information technology to support the human decision process will therefore be an important aspect of ATM modernization. The premise of many of the proposed shared information systems is that the performance of ATM operations will improve with an increase in Shared Situation Awareness between agents (<b>Pilots,</b> <b>Controller,</b> Dispatchers). This will allow better informed control decisions and an improved ability to negotiate between agents. A common information basis may reduce communication load and may increase the level of collaboration in the decision process. In general, information sharing is expected to have advantages for all agents within the system. However there are important questions which remain to be,addressed. For example: What shared information is most important for developing effective Shared Situation Awareness? Are there issues of information saturation? Does information parity create ambiguity in control authority? Will information sharing induce undesirable or unstable gaming behavior between agents? This paper will explore the effect of current and proposed information sharing between different ATM agents. The paper will primarily concentrate on bilateral tactical interactions between specific agents (Pilot/Controller; Controller/Controller; Pilot/Dispatcher; Controller/Dispatcher) however it will also briefly discuss multilateral interaction and more strategic interactions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) is used {{to collect}} voluntarily {{submitted}} aviation safety reports from <b>pilots,</b> <b>controllers</b> and others. As such it is particularly useful in researching aviation safety deficiencies. In this paper we address two challenges related {{to the analysis of}} ASRS data: (1) the unsupervised extraction of meaningful and interpretable topics from ASRS reports and (2) multi-label classification of ASRS data based on a set of predefined categories. For topic modeling we investigate the practical usefulness of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) when it comes to modeling ASRS reports in terms of interpretable topics. We also utilize LDA to generate a more compact representation of ASRS reports to be used in multi-label classification. For multi-label classification we propose a novel and highly scalable multi-label classification algorithm based on multi-variate regression. Empirical results indicate that our approach is superior to several baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. 1...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: NextGen {{technologies}} {{promise to}} provide considerable benefits {{in terms of}} enhancing operations and improving safety. However, {{there needs to be}} a thorough human factors evaluation of the way these systems will change the way in which <b>pilot</b> and <b>controllers</b> share information. The likely impact of these new technologies on pilot/controller coordinated decision making is considered in this paper using the "operational, informational and evaluative disconnect" framework. Method: Five participant focus groups were held. Participants were four experts in human factors, between x and x research students and a technical expert. The participant focus group evaluated five key NextGen technologies to identify issues that made different disconnects more or less likely. Results: Issues that were identified were: Decision Making will not necessarily improve because <b>pilots</b> and <b>controllers</b> possess the same information; Having a common information source does not mean <b>pilots</b> and <b>controllers</b> are looking at the same information; High levels of automation may lead to disconnects between the technology and pilots/controllers; Common information sources may become the definitive source for information; Overconfidence in the automation may lead to situations where appropriate breakdowns are not initiated. Discussion: The issues that were identified lead to recommendations that need to be considered in the development of NextGen technologies. The current state of development of these technologies provides a good opportunity to utilize recommendations at an early stage so that NextGen technologies do not lead to difficulties in resolving breakdowns in coordinated decision making...|$|R
