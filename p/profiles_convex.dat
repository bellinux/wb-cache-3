40|$|For {{a certain}} Mach {{number of the}} {{oncoming}} flow, the local velocity first reaches {{the value of the}} local velocity of sound (M = 1) at some point {{on the surface of the}} body located within the flow. This Mach number is designated the critical Mach number M(sub cr). By increasing the flow velocity, a supersonic local region is formed bounded by the body contour and the line of transition from subsonic to supersonic velocity. As is shown by observations with the Toepler apparatus, at a certain flow Mach number M > M(sub cr) a shock wave is formed near the body that closes the local supersonic region from behind. The formation of the shock wave is associated with the appearance of an additional resistance defined as the wave drag. In this paper, certain features are described of the flow in the local supersonic region, which is bounded by the contour of the body and the transition line, and conditions are sought for which the potential flow with the local supersonic region becomes impossible and a shock wave occurs. In the first part of the paper, the general properties of the potential flow in the local supersonic region, bounded by the contour of the profile and the transition line, are established. It is found that at the transition line, if it is not a line of discontinuity, the law of monotonic variation of the angle of inclination of the velocity vector holds (monotonic law). An approximation is given for the change in velocity at the contour of the body. The flow about a contour having a straight part is studied. In the second part of the paper, an approximation is given of the magnitudes of the accelerations at the interior points of the supersonic region. With the aid of these approximations, it is shown that for <b>profiles</b> <b>convex</b> to the flow the breakdown of the potential flow,associated with an increase of the Mach number of the oncoming flow, cannot be due to the formation of an envelope of the characteristics within the supersonic region. On the basis of the monotonic law, the transitional Mach number M is found, beyond which the potential flow with local supersonic region becomes impossible...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} ergodic capacity of fre-quency selective multipath fading channels with path correlations. The exact capacity expression is derived. The main result establishes that, for the uncorrelated case, the ergodic capacity {{does not depend}} on either the number of taps or the power delay profile of the channel. However when tap correlation is taken into account, this statement is no longer valid, and high dependence on the channel profile is observed. Although it is impossible to test the iInpact of different tap correlation rnodels ex-haustively, detailed analytical study is carried out under a particular neighbor tap correlation model, i. e., only two neighbor taps are correlated. The worst case that yields the minimal capacity is identified after the intractable and non-convex problem is translated into a convex op-timization one. An exact analytical power delay profile for arbitrary number of taps is derived in this case.
