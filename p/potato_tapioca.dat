50|$|The {{ancestor}} of Wuvulu made ponds by digging {{the ground and}} pouring in fresh water to plant hula and the great taro around the pond. Wuvulu people also planted sweet <b>potato,</b> <b>tapioca,</b> and cabbage in their gardens. Fishing {{is important to the}} Wuvulu society and they have many different fishing methods. One method is to have a group of women form a big half circle with a fishing net while walking along the reef. The fish hide behind the rocks because the movement of the tide and the women can easily catch them by lifting the stone. They mainly depend on bush when they are building houses or constructing a canoe. During the German colonial period, locals faced difficulties as the trees were cut down by Germans. The people of Wuvulu are nice and always help each other build houses and gardens. On the aspect of food, they often cook with coconut milk. It is taboo for local people to eat coconut crab, shell-fish, and turtles even though some of them cannot refuse the charm of these foods. The population of Wuvulu was dramatically reduced {{at the end of the}} last century because of Malaria and other diseases that were spread by outsiders. At that time, at least 90% of the population died of foreign diseases. Christianity is very popular in this island, every Sabbath day (Saturday), the residents will gather to sing songs written in Hawaiian.|$|E

A testing machine of the texture analyzer applied a specific blade to shear the vegetables and automatically generate data. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the relationship between starchy vegetables hardness and moisture content which influenced the production rate in grating and slicing products. The selected starchy vegetables used for this study were white potato, sweet <b>potato,</b> <b>tapioca</b> and yam. The maximum hardness was computed and analyzed using the texture analyzer. It was found that the maximum hardness of white potato, yam, sweet potato and tapioca were 6. 67, 12. 01, 16. 98 and 20. 08 kg respectively. It was determined that white potato had the highest moisture content among the vegetables, which was 78. 14 %. In conclusion, the lower value of hardness and higher value of moisture content are significantly correlated to higher production rate of grating and slicing products.

40|$|Abstract— The {{effects of}} {{microwave}} heating on properties of starch were studied on <b>potato</b> and <b>tapioca</b> starches in water suspension at different temperature (50 °C and 60 °C). <b>Potato</b> and <b>tapioca</b> starches were adjusted to 30 % (w/v) and heat-moisture {{treated in a}} microwave oven and conventional heating. Conventional heating {{was carried out by}} direct heating the moisture heated sample at 50 ºC and 60 ºC while the microwave heating was carried out by microwave oven and the temperature was controlled approximately to 50 ºC and 60 ºC. The heated starch samples were analyzed for amylose content, pasting properties, swelling and solubility, thermal properties, light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction. There were present several changes on physicochemical and functional properties of heated starch for both heating methods. However, microwave method gave higher affect on heating treatment rather than conventional heating. Microwave heating was evidenced in affecting pasting properties of <b>potato</b> and <b>tapioca</b> starches by increase the pasting temperature and the paste stability. Microwave heating also significantly increased the amylose content and swelling power but reduced the solubility and enthalpy of gelatinization (ΔH) of those starches. There were changes in granule structure of starch observed by loss of birefringence and ruptures granule in SEM micrographs in both heating treatment.

40|$|A {{number of}} in vitro and in vivo {{instrumental}} tests {{have been developed}} to reflect various aspects of the perceived oral texture of starch-based vanilla custard desserts. These tests include measurements of the food's infra-red reflectance (IRR), of the turbidity of spat-out rinse water, and of the friction between the food and the oral tissue. Also, images of spat-out foods have been digitally processed and image-processing parameters extracted. These tests, together with conventional rheological tests, were carried out on a set of vanilla custard desserts that varied systematically with respect to fat content (0 - 15 %), starch content (3. 3 - 5. 1 %), and type of modified starch (<b>potato,</b> <b>tapioca,</b> and waxy maize starch with various degrees of cross-liking) judged by nine highly trained QDA panelists. Three sensory dimensions could be identified from principal component analysis to summarize the sensory texture space of the custards. The results from instrumental measurements, together with the effects of ingredients, indicated that the fist dimension, running from roughness to creaminess, was related to lubrication. The second dimension, running from melting to thickness, was related to stimulus viscosity. Finally, the third dimension, running from airy to heterogeneous, was related to starch type. The results indicate that each sensory dimension has attributes that are either related to surface properties or to bulk properties of the food bolus and that saliva - and starch break-down by salivary amylase - should be incorporated into instrumental measurements. Key sensory attributes from all three dimensions were predicted well from instrumental measurements. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{hydrophilic}} (HLB 15) sucrose ester (SE) emulsifier on native starches from maize, <b>potato,</b> <b>tapioca</b> and wheat (normal starches with approximately 20 - 25 % amylose) and mutant waxy (100 % amylopectin) and Hylon VII (high amylose) maize starches were studied. ^ The SE reduced iodine binding capacity (IBC) and glucoamylase digestibility of native, normal starches and high amylose maize starch, presumably due to starch-SE inclusion complex formation. A weak, limited interaction was observed between waxy maize starch (amylopectin) and the SE. ^ The SE reduced the enthalpy of gelatinization of the normal starches, but not waxy maize starch, as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), indicating that complex formation between the SE and amylose occurred during starch gelatinization. Complex formation was further confirmed {{by the presence of}} a complex melting endotherm during rescanning (reheating) of samples by DSC. ^ Starch fractions solubilized by boiling and sonication of normal, waxy and Hylon VII maize starches were evaluated by high performance size exclusion chromatography. Addition of the SE to presolubilized starch samples preferentially removed amylose from solution, presumably due to precipitation of insoluble starch-SE complex. Weak interactions between SE and amylopectin resulting in formation of soluble aggregates was suggested but not confirmed. ^ Unique cooking properties of each of the starches studied were demonstrated in Rapid Visco-Analyzer viscosity profiles. The SE increased time to peak for the normal starches and waxy maize starch, suggesting interaction between the starch and SE due to complex formation at the granule surface during gelatinization. Hot and cold viscosities of the normal starches were also affected by the SE but the direction and magnitude of the effect varied with starch type. ^ X-ray diffraction confirmed V-hydrate (inclusion) complex formation between the SE and normal maize but not waxy maize starch. Preliminary NMR data indicated some interaction between normal and waxy maize starches and the SE during starch gelatinization although the nature of the interaction could not be determined. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} between starches and the components in spices and herbs have been poorly studied so far. This {{study investigated the}} preliminary effects of thirty-six different spices and herbs on pasting properties of rice starch. It largely concentrated on the characterization of a partially purified carom extract (from the dried fruit of the Trachyspermum ammi plant) and its influence on the structural, thermal, pasting properties and digestibility of native rice starch. Rheology, differential scanning calorimetry, size exclusion chromatography coupled with a multi-angle laser light scattering, zeta potential, hot-stage optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and in-vitro starch digestion analysis were carried out to characterise the carom extract and starch-carom system. The results showed that carom, cumin, fennel, mulberry leaf, perilla leaf, neem and coriander seed extracts showed peak and final viscosity-suppressing effect, while mesona, rosemary, green tea, thyme, and clove extracts showed peak viscosity-enhancing effect on rice starch during starch pasting. The water-soluble fraction of carom had the highest degree of viscosity-suppressing effect as compared to other spices and herbs. With increasing concentration of carom, the peak and final viscosities of rice starch decreased; the onset, peak, and end temperatures of rice starch increased; and granular swelling of potato starch was restricted and delayed. The viscosity-suppressing effect was not caused by pH or small molecular carom compounds such as mineral salts and phytochemicals. A protein polymer in carom extract with an Mw of ~ 2. 08 + 0. 10 x 105 Da and isoelectric point of ~ 3. 5 was found responsible for the suppression effect. The protein fraction completely denatured at ~ 83 oC. Micrographs of SEM showed that carom protein appeared as raisin-like clusters. The ability of carom protein to suppress the peak viscosity of starch was also observed in <b>potato,</b> <b>tapioca,</b> glutinous rice, waxy maize, waxy rice, rice, sweet potato, maize, wheat, and pea starches, suggesting that the effect was independent of the source and ratio of amylose to amylopectin. It was proposed that the protein molecules could be interacting with the starch granular surface and/or starch molecules. In-vitro starch digestion study showed that dialysed carom extract with rice starch caused an unusual increment in glucose release. The lower viscosity of the starch-carom gels and/or a carom enzyme stimulatory effect were proposed {{to be responsible for}} increasing the rapid breakdown of starch...|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteDelores ChambersThe rising {{awareness}} of celiac disease, an intestinal intolerance to gluten, {{has increased the}} demand for gluten-free products. Gluten is a protein that provides structure to breads, cakes, cookies, and other wheat-flour based baked goods. When flour and water are combined and mixed, the proteins glutenin and gliaden present in wheat combine and a network of gluten is formed. In addition to providing structure and elasticity to dough, it also traps air within the matrix and allows baked goods to rise and maintain desirable characteristics such as an open and airy crumb structure and chewiness of bread products. Removing gluten from a baked good formulation affects the finished product in many ways. This review examines research conducted {{on the effects of}} many various ingredients on finished product quality of gluten-free baked goods. Quality parameters that are most greatly affected by the exclusion of gluten in baked goods include specific volume (a measure of the amount of air incorporated into the finished product), height, spread ratio (the ratio of diameter to thickness in cookies and like products), color, and hardness. Gluten-free baked goods are recognized to be denser, shorter in height, have a larger spread, have a different color, and be harder in texture than traditional wheat-based baked goods. Various gluten-free ingredients have been studied for their use in producing a finished product that exhibits quality parameters similar to wheat-based baked goods. These include rice, <b>potato,</b> <b>tapioca,</b> corn, and sorghum; pseudocereals such as buckwheat, amaranth, and quinoa; legumes; nuts; and waste from fruit and vegetable processing. The inclusion of additives such as hydrocolloids, protein concentrates, emulsifiers, and acidic ingredients are extensively utilized and studied in gluten-free baked good applications. Gluten-free baked goods commonly have a reduced shelf life as compared to wheat-based products. The weak association of water with the starches present in gluten-free baked goods allows moisture to migrate to the outside of the product and rapidly escape. Shelf life studies are also included in much of the research and are summarized in this review. Because consumers desire gluten-free products that taste like the gluten-containing products they replace, many studies pertaining to gluten-free ingredient research include sensory analysis. Some studies include a wheat-based product as a control, while others use only gluten-free formulations in the research. Future research using better sensory methods are needed in this product category. Food manufacturers who wish to compete in the still growing gluten-free market have many ingredient resources available to them to produce high quality gluten-free baked goods. Through research conducted on alternative flours, starches, hydrocolloids, emulsifiers, and other ingredients, gluten-free consumers can enjoy baked goods that exhibit the same desirable qualities as traditional wheat-flour based products...|$|E
