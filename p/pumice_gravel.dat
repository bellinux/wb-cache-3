Frozen vells were partially thawed and minced in a Hobart 2 ̆ 2 Wonder worker. 2 ̆ 2 The tissue was treated with 2. 0 per cent potassium alum and allowed to stand for 20 hours before sufficient 0. 45 M disodium phosphate was added to bring the pH of the mixture to 5. 7. Dry sodium chloride was added until the salt concentration in the moisture of the mixture was 10 per cent. The tissue was then mixed with 3 / 4 -inch <b>pumice</b> <b>gravel</b> in a volume ratio of 1 to 2 and packed into extractor columns. The tissue was extracted continuously with a 10 per cent sodium chloride solution. The yield of enzyme and extract viscosity from 60 undried vells was compared with that from 60 dried vells. The undried vells yielded 2. 99 x 106 R. U. in 86 liters of extract and the dried vells yielded 3. 03 x 106 R. U. in 74 liters of extract.

40|$|Presented at The Oregon Water Conference, May 24 - 25, 2011, Corvallis, OR. The {{study area}} lies {{north-northeast}} of Crater Lake National Park and {{is covered by}} 2 to 3 m of pumice deposited during the climactic eruption of Mount Mazama approximately 7700 years before present. The pumice deposit hosts unconfined, seasonally connected, perched aquifers that support groundwater dependent ecosystems at points of discharge in the 80 km 2 study area. Sparse bedrock outcrops are dominated by basalt lava flows, but cores from groundwater monitoring wells at four sites contain abundant moderately to weakly indurated, interlayered basalt hydroclastic- and pyroclastic-flow deposits, and matrix-rich tuff breccia. Although some water may enter the unconfined pumice aquifer from flow paths within bedrock units, the lithologies encountered in wells and little to no water in piezometers screened in bedrock suggest little contribution to the unconfined aquifer from bedrock-hosted flow paths. Pre-Mazama surficial deposits are the local base or may locally augment storage in the unconfined aquifer. The distribution of these deposits is strongly influenced by the pre-eruption topography with poorly to moderately well sorted silt- and clay-rich sedimentary deposits common in pre-eruption valleys and shallow, bed-rock controlled depressions. Post-eruption landscape response included erosion of pumice with valley bottoms cut into pumice, pre-eruption surficial deposits, or bedrock. Where pumice is preserved, the coarser-grained upper pumice unit (moderately to poorly sorted coarse lapilli to blocks) has been removed and the erosion surface is cut into the finer-grained lower pumice unit (well-sorted, fine to coarse lapilli). This early-formed erosion surface is commonly buried by alluvium consisting of crystal-rich sand near the lower contact grading upward to rounded pumice-bearing glassy silt, silty sand, and <b>pumice</b> <b>gravel.</b> The contacts between the alluvium and valley walls cut into pumice deposits are commonly iron stained and locally intensely cemented by iron oxide. In some pre-eruption valley configurations, alluvial fans composed of glassy-silt, crystals, and rounded pumice extend across the valley bottom and overlie the complete pumice section. These deposits are 1. 0 to 1. 5 m thick in some fans. Recharge of the unconfined pumice aquifer occurs during spring snow melt from direct contribution by snow melting on valley floors and upland depressions, runoff from partially frozen ground, and shallow flow paths in the pumice blanket. Once in the unconfined pumice aquifer groundwater may infiltrate to deeper levels, be consumed by evapotranspiration, migrate through the aquifer along seasonally connected flow pathways, or return to the surface at fens and springs. Where the water table within the pumice is within approximately 1 m of the surface during the dry season, grasses and sedges are common in well-vegetated meadows. Where year-round discharge takes place, fens characterized by high biodiversity and peat deposits are present. The location of these discharge sites appears to reflect ongoing response of the landscape to the eruption of Mount Mazama. At the discharge points, water is consumed by evapotranspiration through lush and diverse vegetation communities, evaporates, or infiltrates back into the unconfined aquifer down valley. Groundwater temperature may provide an inexpensive way to define flow pathways in the unconfined pumice aquifer and to detect contribution of ground water contributed from deeper seated flow pathways in bedrock. Two monitoring sites, one at the Wilshire fen and the other at the Johnson Meadow fen, suggest cooler water entering the unconfined pumice aquifer in late summer...|$|E

40|$|To {{successfully}} explore near-Earth Asteroids {{the question}} of mobility emerges as the key issue for any robotic mission. When small bodies have extremely low escape velocities, traditional methods, such as wheels, would send the robot hurtling off of the asteroid's surface. To solve this problem, JPL has developed an omni-directional anchoring mechanism for use in microgravity that utilizes microspine technology. These microspines are placed in circular arrays with 16 independent carriages biasing {{the surface of the}} rock. The asperities in the surface allow the gripper to hold nearly 150 N in all directions. While the gripper has been proven successful on consolidated rocks, it had yet to be tested on a variety of other surfaces that are suspected to separate the large boulders on an asteroid. Since asteroid surfaces vary widely, from friable rocks to lose ponds of regolith, the gripper was tested in a large variety of materials such as, bonded <b>pumice,</b> sand, <b>gravel,</b> and loose rocks. The forces are applied tangent, at 45 degrees, and normal {{to the surface of the}} material.

30|$|Sand is {{the most}} {{abundant}} admixing agent for Fe 0 filters. Fe 0 /sand filters should, therefore, be considered a reference system and other systems tested in comparison (Btatkeu-K et al. 2014, 2016). This approach has not been adopted and various aggregates (Fe 3 O 4, <b>gravel,</b> <b>pumice,</b> zeolite) have been positively tested (Moraci and Calabrò 2010; Huang et al. 2012; Bilardi et al. 2013 a, b; Huang et al. 2013 a, b). In all the cases, it should be considered that the initial system (t 0  =  0) {{is made up of}} Fe 0 and the used aggregate(s). With increasing operational duration (t > t 0), the aggregates are progressively coated with iron oxides (in situ coating). This is particularly valid for inert aggregates like sand or pumice. In other words, in many systems, the whole filter probably becomes an ionic selective system, preferentially adsorbing species with high affinities to iron oxides (Phukan 2015; Phukan et al. 2015, 2016).|$|R
30|$|In true sense, no {{technologies}} independently counter all the problems. The {{development of}} {{technology is a}} dynamic process that moves forward slowly and recommendations are made based on the best science available at that time. However, with new research and new results, the flaws of existing technologies may be removed. That is why {{the concept of the}} combinations of technologies or in other sense hybrid technologies has come. Scientists and technologists have orchestrated according to the requirement. Let us discuss with the synergistic RO technology first. In the RO technology, feed pretreatment is vital for RO to avoid problems, i.e., fouling, damaging the membranes. Conventional pretreatment steps include chemicals addition, i.e., acid, coagulant/flocculant, disinfection. Coagulation and flocculation (coagulants–flocculants) are dealt in water treatment process. Chlorine treatment is treated as disinfection process and commonly employed. But chlorination shortens the stability of the membrane and, thus, dechlorination treatment (viz. sodium bi sulfite) is required. In media filtration, water is treated by passing through granular media like <b>pumice,</b> anthracite, <b>gravels,</b> etc. {{that can be used in}} combination. Cartridge filter (made up of papers, woven wire, cloth) is used as the last pretreatment step to retain particles in the size range 1 – 10 μm. To check the quality, ‘Silt Intensity Index’ or SDI parameter is important. Actually, SDI considers the ratio of two flow measurements, one at the beginning, and the other at the end by passing feed water through a 0.45  μm filter paper in dead end mode at constant pressure (Saha and Bhattacharya 2010).|$|R
30|$|For two {{different}} particle sizes d 1 and d 2, d 2  = n × d 1, SSA 1 /SSA 2  = d 2 /d 1  = n × d 1 /d 1  = n. If d 2  =  2  × d 1, SSA 1 /SSA 2  =  2. This means that halving the particle size doubles the surface area. In other words, using smaller particles increases the area available for contaminant accumulation (adsorption) and subsequent reduction (if applicable). However, decreasing the particle size is coupled with rapid production of corrosion products and, thus, short service {{life for the}} Fe 0 materials (Gillham 2003; Crane and Scott 2012; Noubactep et al. 2012 a). Moreover, because small particles react very rapidly, particle cementation is observed within a relative short time (Crane and Scott 2012; Noubactep et al. 2012 a). Although there are other explanations for particle agglomeration, expansive iron corrosion {{is the first one}} and implies that dispersion of nano Fe 0 is a pre-requisite for its application (Crane and Scott 2012; Noubactep et al. 2012 a). Coming back to μm and mm sized particles, the slowness of involved processes has delayed the universal acceptance of the evidence that admixing Fe 0 and non-expansive aggregate (e.g., <b>gravel,</b> <b>pumice,</b> sand) are equally a pre-requisite for sustainability (Miyajima 2012; Miyajima and Noubactep 2012; Caré et al. 2013; Noubactep 2013 d). It is understood that gelatinous iron hydroxides also cement particles of added aggregates, particularly under oxic conditions. This evidence makes porous materials (composite iron matrix, sponge iron) potential better materials for sustainable Fe 0 filters (Rahman et al. 2013; Li et al. 2011; Neumann et al. 2013; Xu et al. 2013).|$|R
