50|$|The 1970s saw {{the fading}} away of the {{exuberance}} and the radicalism of the 1960s.

50|$|One {{justification}} for privatization {{has been that}} it would accelerate the increase of access to water and sanitation, in particular the poor. However, according to McNallen and Olivier, private cherry picking has had deleterious effects on the cross-subsidization which has made possible even the moderate provision of water and sanitation services to such users. According to the think tank PSIRU - which is financed by Public Services International, a global federation of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>trade</b> unions - in Manaus, Suez-Lyonnaise des Eaux backtracked on promises to expand access to 95% of the population immediately after receiving a 30-year concession in June 2000.|$|R
40|$|Under both Labor and Liberal governments Australia {{has been}} one of the world&# 039;s leading proponents of privatisation.

Within a relatively short period of time there has been a reconsolidation of ownership in the energy and transport sectors which raises new challenges for the trade unions.

40|$|Abstract: Based on a {{questionnaire}} survey {{of members of}} the UK <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>trade</b> union UNISON, this article examines factors that influence the ability and willingness of trade union members to take on unpaid roles {{at the level of the}} branch and region. The article compares the experiences and views of men and women in relation to potential barriers to union participation. Participation at both branch and regional levels is found to be associated with collective orientations and the extent to which members feel encouraged by UNISON to become active within the union. The findings point to the importance of union efforts to encourage members to take on lay representative roles and participate in union governance...|$|R

Within a relatively short period of the privatisation of the energy and transport sectors in Victoria Australia, there was a reconsolidation of ownership which raised new challenges for the trade unions. After this phase, the main trade unions in these two sectors took steps to meet these new circumstances to renew and rebuild their structures and strengthen their capacity to challenge the new private oligopolies. Thus, paradoxically some unions were able to open up space to renew and rebuild in the postprivatisation world...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} the programs delivered by the Canadian Trade Commissioner Service (TCS) on export performance by Canadian firms. We draw on a unique set of microdata created by linking three separate firm-level databases: Statistics Canada’s Exporter Register and its Business Register, which provide information on export activity and firm characteristics, and the TCS client management database maintained by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada, which contains details on trade promotion services provided to Canadian firms. We apply the treatment effects analytical framework to isolate the effects of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>trade</b> promotion. We find that TCS programs have a consistent and positive impact on Canadian exporter performance. Exporters that access TCS services export, on average, 17. 9 percent more than comparable exporters that do not. Furthermore, we also find that TCS assistance benefits exporters in terms of product and market diversification. ...|$|R
40|$|Johar Market {{region is}} one of {{shopping}} facility regions in Semarang. The existence of Johar Market serves <b>public</b> in <b>trade</b> <b>sector</b> and influences Semarang economic activity. However, there are now various problems occurred in this market that will certainly influenc the consumer's perception. The research aims to identify and to analyze the service improvement of market facilities in Johar Market region based on consumer's satisfaction level and to direct the service quality improvement of the market facilities. This research uses qualitative explanatory analysis that is to describe the existing conditions and activities in Johar Market region and qualitative comparative analysis {{that is used to}} analyze the service improvement of the market facilities. The result shows that generally the consumers consider that Johar market facilities have not yet accommodated their needs and interests. The consumers dissatisfy with bad air circulation and illumination, pedestrian's circulation, and supporting infrastructure. Their perceptions are worsen by the street vendors disturbance, tidal flooding problems, traffic jam, in-disciplined public transportation, unavailability of pedestrians, lack of vegetation, and environmental chaos. Thus the consumers demand an improvement to give satisfaction during shopping. Based on some necessities for facility services at Johar Market region, it is recommended to discipline and relocate the street vendors, re-converse the square to be public space, manage Johar Market region without changing its characteristics as historical region, create it to be shopping tourism region, and improve the supporting infrastructure and commodity which will attract community and stakeholder participation in the ethic to develop...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of alliances between mental health workers and psychiatric survivor movements – a focus that has received little scholarly attention to date. Particular {{attention is paid to}} alliances between survivors and <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>trade</b> unions in the UK. These alliances are replete with what, in a more general context, Wendy Brown (2000) has called perils and possibilities. The possibilities of such alliances will be framed in terms of the need to defend, as well as transform, health and welfare institutions from threats presented by neoliberalism and bio-psychiatry, as well as the need for a creative renewal of the activism of both the labour and survivor movements. Models of reciprocal community trade unionism and relational organizing will be presented as a potential way of developing “deeply engaged” and reciprocally beneficial relationships (Tattersall 2006) that, we believe, are necessary for the transformation of the mental health system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{interactions}} between wages in the <b>public</b> <b>sector,</b> the <b>traded</b> private <b>sector</b> and the closed sector in ten EU Transition Countries during the period 2000 - 2010. The theoretical literature on wage spillovers, {{as well as the}} Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis, suggest that the internationally <b>traded</b> <b>sector</b> should be the leader in wage setting, with sheltered and public sector wages adjusting. Using a Cointegrated VAR approach we show that a large heterogeneity across countries is present, and non-traded and public sector wages are often leaders in wage determination or at least affect <b>traded</b> <b>sector</b> wages in the short run. In some countries, public sector wages are weakly exogenous, with the private sectors adjusting. This result is relevant from a policy perspective since wage spillovers, leading to costs growing faster than productivity, may affect the international cost competitiveness of the <b>traded</b> <b>sector</b> and thus the catching-up process may be accompanied by accumulation of large international imbalances. Cointegrated VAR, wage setting, public sector...|$|R
30|$|As a result, the {{development}} {{level of the}} <b>trade</b> <b>sector</b> {{also needs to be}} taken into account. In other words, assuming that Province A has a higher degree of specialization and relatively more developed <b>trade</b> <b>sectors,</b> while Province B has a higher degree of equalization and less developed <b>trade</b> <b>sectors</b> than A, the results show that Province A has a higher level of technological innovation than B. Considering the positive effect that {{the development}} of <b>trade</b> <b>sectors</b> may have on technological innovation, {{it is difficult to determine}} whether this is due to the specialization of the <b>trade</b> <b>sector</b> or the development of the <b>trade</b> <b>sector</b> itself. Therefore, it is only when the development level of trade in specialized-trade areas is equal or inferior to equalized-trade areas that one can conclude that specialization is more conducive to technological innovation than equalization, and vice versa.|$|R
