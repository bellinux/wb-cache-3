50|$|Sample {{preparation}} of the OPV is {{of the utmost importance}} when performing pc-AFM studies. The sampling substrate is recommended to be conductive, as well as transparent, to the light source which is irradiated upon it. Numerous studies have used ITO-coated glass as their conductive substrate. Because of high cost of ITO, however, there have been attempts to utilize other semiconducting layers, such as zinc oxide (ZnO) and carbon nanotubes as an alternative to ITO. Although these semiconductors are relatively inexpensive, high quality ITO layers are still being used extensively for PV applications. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate), more commonly known as PEDOT:PSS, is a transparent, polymeric conductive layer which is usually placed between the ITO and the active OPV layer. The PEDOT:PSS is a conductive polymer is stable over various applied charges. In most studies, PEDOT:PSS is spin-coated onto the ITO-coated glass substrates directly after <b>plasma</b> <b>cleaning</b> of the ITO. <b>Plasma</b> <b>cleaning,</b> as well as halo-acid etching, have been shown to improve the surface uniformity and conductivity of the substrate. This PEDOT:PSS layer is then annealed to the ITO prior to spin-coating the OPV layer onto the substrate. Studies by Pingree et al. have shown the direct correlation between annealing time and both peak and average photocurrent generation. Once this OPV film is spin-coated onto the substrate, it is then annealed at temperatures between 70 and 170 °C, for periods up to an hour depending on the procedure as well as OPV being used.|$|E
50|$|Plasma {{afterglow}} {{has shown}} {{to be an effective}} means of cleaning and sterilizing difficult to take apart machinery and glassware. <b>Plasma</b> <b>cleaning</b> uses remote plasma sources to generate an afterglow that is ventilated into the system to be cleaned and then the afterglow ions react with the contaminants. When oxygen is used as the carrier gas, ionized oxygen species react with heavier organic compounds to form H2O, CO2, and CO. These products are then easily vented from the system effectively removing organic contaminants from the system. This provides the advantage of not having to take systems apart and thus saves time on disassembly and on vacuum systems it saves time changing the pressure of the system.|$|E
