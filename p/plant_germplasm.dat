Phenotypic characters were observed directly in the field, whereas genetic characters were observed with RAPD markers using 10 primers. Phylogenetic analysis was done using NT-SYS software showed that there were three clusters of carambola varieties. Meanwhile, Malaysia and Penang varieties have closed relationships (96 %) compared with the other varieties.

40|$|Cryptic {{endophyte}} consortia {{associated with}} embryonic tissues of fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) {{are believed to}} serve mutualistic functions. However, the complexity of these endophyte communities makes cause-and-effect relationships difficult to establish. In fourwing saltbush, cryptic endophytes are thought to enhance drought and salt tolerance, nutrient acquisition, germination, and establishment. Some of these traits can be conferred to alternate host plants by co-culturing seedlings in vitro with micropropagated fourwing saltbush callus. Here we describe an evolving process for; 1) identifying arrays of cryptic, seed borne endophytes associated with fourwing saltbush; 2) evaluating early vigor of grasses and other plants endowed with fourwing saltbush endophytes; 3) selecting plant-endophyte combinations with increased tolerance to abiotic stressors, and 4) monitoring the persistance of transferred endophytes across plant generations in increasingly complex habitats. This process is designed to evaluate specific plant-fungal interactions that influence host tolerance to salinity, but may be broadly adaptable for selecting endophyte-enhanced <b>plant</b> <b>germplasms</b> {{with a variety of}} desired traits...|$|R

The {{experiment was}} laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications. With the delay in planting time from Oct 30 yield was reduced in later plantings.

High frequency of sprouting and shoot differentiation was observed from cotyledonary node explants compared to shoot tip, on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium fortified with BA, KN, 2 -iP and CM. Of the cytokinins used, BA (3. 0 mgl- 1) supported highest average number and maximum multiple shoot differentiation (16. 6). In vitro proliferated shoots were multiplied rapidly by culturing nodal segments as microcuttings, further subcultured on the same media for elongation. Elongated shoots upon transfer to MS medium fortified with IBA showed rooting within two weeks of culture. Rooted plantlets were successfully hardened and 75 % of rooted shoots successfully survived on establishment to the soil. Plants looked healthy with no visually detectable phenotypic variations.

40|$|Nearly {{a century}} {{has been spent}} {{collecting}} and preserving genetic diversity in <b>plants.</b> <b>Germplasm</b> banks—living seed collections that serve as repositories of genetic varia-tion—have been established {{as a source of}} genes for improving agricultural crops. Genetic linkage maps have made it possible to study the chromosomal locations of genes for improving yield and other complex traits important to agriculture. The tools of genome research may finally unleash the genetic potential of our wild and cultivated germplasm resources for the benefit of society. As we head into the next millennium, the world faces a greater demand on agricultural output {{than at any time in}} history. Despite efforts to curb birthrates, the Earth’s human population is expected to rise to 8. 9 billion by the year 2030, corresponding to more than a 50 % increase from the current population of 5. 7 billion (1). In the past, we have met the demand for increased agricultural productivity by a combination of genetic improvements, greater farming inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, and water), and cultivation of more land. With dwindling freshwater reserves and pe-troleum resources (on which fertilizers and pesticides are based) and increased problems caused by agricultural pollution, we can hard-ly expect to increase or even maintain our current levels of agricultural inputs. Similarly, much existing farmland is falling victim to urban expansion, and it is unlikely that new farmland will become available in the near future. That leaves the genetic improvement of crops as the most viable approach by which food production can attempt to keep pace with the anticipated growth of the human population. For the genetic approach to succeed, we must harness the wealth of genetic variation provided by nature and currently warehoused in our seed reposito-ries. Until now we have been only modestly successful in utilizing these resources for plant improvement. New findings from ge-nome research indicate that there is tre-mendous genetic potential locked up in seed banks that can be released only by shifting the paradigm from searching for phenotypes to searching for superior genes with the aid of molecular linkage maps...|$|R
