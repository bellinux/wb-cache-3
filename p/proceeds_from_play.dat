Titled Avalanche, the play showed daily life in a mountain village in which villagers must obey every order of their elders {{in order to avoid}} actions which might trigger a deadly avalanche.

50|$|In September 10-19 the Outdoor Amphitheater stages Riders of the Flood, {{a popular}} {{historical}} drama {{based on the}} book by Pocahontas County author W. E. Blackhurst for the Riders of the Flood Outdoor Drama. The play's theme is a demonstration of Ronceverte's importance in the turn of the 20th century, when its St. Lawrence Boom and Lumber Company was the largest softwood mill in the country, and traces of its industry have sculpted Ronceverte's portion of the Greenbrier River to the shape it is today. All <b>proceeds</b> <b>from</b> the <b>play</b> are recycled back into the town of Ronceverte with the intention of improving the community, uplifting its economy, and fostering civic pride. Riders of the Flood is a member of West Virginia's Institute for Outdoor Drama. At this point, it is a purely volunteer program, as is its sequel, Big Dreams, Restless Spirit.|$|R
5000|$|In 1998 {{he began}} working on a one-man autobiographical play called Completely With/Out Character, his debut effort. The final version was {{produced}} by The Necessary Stage, written by Haresh Sharma, directed by Alvin Tan and staged at The Drama Centre from 10-17 May 1999. At {{the end of each}} performance, Chew would strip to his shorts and raise his arms to allow the audience to take in his emaciated frame. This was followed by a frank question and answer session. All <b>proceeds</b> <b>from</b> the <b>play</b> were donated to the charity organisation for which he was an outspoken volunteer, Action for AIDS (AfA). Reviewing the play in The Straits Times, poet and playwright Alfian Sa'at called Completely With/Out Character [...] "the most extreme form of docu-theatre", writing, [...] "The audience was given the privilege of witnessing a play, which, like its subject, was too aware of its ephemeral existence".|$|R
25|$|Hecht {{wrote the}} script for the Bergson Group's {{production}} of A Flag is Born, which opened on September 5, 1946 at the Alvin Playhouse in New York City. The play, which compared the Zionist underground's campaign in Palestine to the American Revolution, was intended to increase {{public support for the}} Zionist cause in the United States. The play starred Marlon Brando and Paul Muni during its various productions. The <b>proceeds</b> <b>from</b> the <b>play</b> were used to purchase a ship that was renamed the SS Ben Hecht, which carried 900 Holocaust survivors to Palestine in March 1947. The Royal Navy captured the ship after it docked, and 600 of its passengers were detained as illegal immigrants and sent to the Cyprus internment camps. The SS Ben Hecht later became the flagship of the Israeli Navy. The crew was imprisoned by the British authorities in Acre Prison, and assisted in the preparations for the Acre Prison break.|$|R
50|$|The Wanderers were {{involved}} {{in the formation of the}} NHA. After the 1908 season, the Wanderers had been sold to P. J. Doran, owner of the Jubilee Rink who now made plans to move the club from the Montreal Arena to the smaller Jubilee for the 1910 season. This upset the other members of the ECHA, who would receive a smaller share of the <b>proceeds</b> <b>from</b> games <b>played</b> in the Wanderers rink. The other ECHA members suspended the ECHA and set up the Canadian Hockey Association league and rejected the application of the Wanderers to join. The Wanderers' representative at the meeting, Jimmy Gardner met Ambrose O'Brien in the ground floor of the hotel where the league was meeting. Gardner suggested to O'Brien, who had been rejected in his application for the Renfrew Creamery Kings to join the ECHA, that they form a new league, including the Wanderers, Renfrew and the Cobalt and Haileybury teams that O'Brien owned. O'Brien agreed and on December 4, 1909, the NHA was founded. Later in January 1910, the CHA folded and Ottawa and Montreal Shamrocks joined the NHA.|$|R

However, {{on the morning of}} the historic event, it was announced that the band (who had actually been billed to appear at the event before they had even agreed to do so) had pulled out of the show. They were replaced by blues rock group George Thorogood and the Destroyers, which has a strong Philadelphia-area following. The official reason given for their non-appearance was that two of their backing musicians, guitarist Andrew Saunders and saxophonist Will Gregory, had quit due to the expiration of their contract; they were replaced by Alan Griffiths on guitar and Josephine Wells on saxophone for the remaining bulk of the 1985 world tour. In place of appearing, the band pledged to donate <b>proceeds</b> <b>from</b> their concerts <b>played</b> in Tokyo, Sydney, London and New York.|$|R
