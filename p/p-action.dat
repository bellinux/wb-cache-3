30|$|Figure 6 {{compares the}} fuzzy {{controller}} with the <b>p-action</b> controller. In some area, the fuzzy controller acts {{better than the}} <b>p-action</b> controller, and in some area, it does not. The major feature of fuzzy controllers is their ability in dealing with uncertainty, which is discussed in the subsequent part; nevertheless, in this study, we decrease the number of rules and use only 165 individuals in our simulation. Probably, it could be more optimal if a different setting is used for multi-objective block.|$|E
30|$|In supply chain, control {{parameter}} settings for different policies and different cases are very important. It is more critical when we face uncertainty. In this study, {{based on a}} fuzzy controller, the bi-objective supply chain model has been analyzed. In this manner, a rule base-maker algorithm {{has been used to}} make new fuzzy rule bases to achieve the optimum rule base. Using a multi-objective manner based on NSGA-II, the optimum parameters for rule maker's input and scaling and forecasting gains have been obtained, and then they have been used for an optimum design of fuzzy controller. In case of the presence of uncertainty, both <b>p-action</b> and fuzzy controllers have been compared, and the obtained results indicate excellent robustness in designed fuzzy controller compared to <b>p-action</b> controller. This robustness becomes more important when we face uncertain lead time because it changes system dynamic (the order of the system). This new bi-objective approach for supply chain design has been proposed which, in the case of uncertainty, is more robust than formerly used <b>p-action</b> controllers.|$|E
30|$|Although Ta is an {{important}} parameter in forecasting mechanism, uncertainty in Tp as lead time is more important because it defines {{the order of the}} system. It is clear that fuzzy controller acts much better than <b>p-action</b> controller.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I have {{presented}} {{the issue of}} not exploiting the possibilities different technologies offer us in video games. The research questions were how can input-technologies affect the enjoyment of video games?", do different input-technologies work better for different types of game mechanics?" and how can game developers best utilize input-technologies in video games?" In order to answer this I have conducted two case studies using case study research; a multiple-case study and a single-case study. Using a theoretical framework consisting of theories from HCI and game studies, I analyzed four video games in the multiple-case study and used the findings to propose a conceptual model called TechMech. The model was then used {{in the development of}} a prototype game, where the development process was used in a single-case study. While I have not found any definitive answers as to how developers can best utilize different input-technologies in their games, my findings suggest that games that support a high degree of <b>p-actions,</b> natural mapping and GameFlow elements were more enjoyable, while games that had a lower degree of <b>p-actions</b> and natural mapping, and which did not follow the criteria for GameFlow were less enjoyable. I present a conceptual model and some practices that I believe can be helpful for developers and researchers in the field. However further research is required; both on the topic in general, and in order to validate the TechMech model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Let M be {{a closed}} simply {{connected}} n-manifold of positive sectional curvature. We determine its homeomorphism or homotopic type if M also admits an isometric elementary p-group action of large rank. Our main results are: There exists a constant p(n) > 0 such that (1) If M 2 n admits an effective isometric Zk <b>p-action</b> for a prime p ≥ p(n), then k ≤ n and “= ” implies that M 2 n is homeomorphic to a sphere or a complex projective space. (2) If M 2 n+ 1 admits an isometric S 1 × Zk <b>p-action</b> for a prime p ≥ p(n), then k ≤ n and “= ” implies that M is homeomorphic to a sphere. (3) For M in (1) or (2), if n ≥ 7 and k ≥ [3 n] + 2, then M is homeomorphic to a 4 sphere or homotopic {{to a complex}} projective space. A basic problem in Riemannian geometry is the classification of the positively curved manifolds whose isometry groups are large (cf. [Gro]). The largeness {{is measured by the}} dimension (resp. the rank of a maximal torus) of the isometry group or the dimension of its orbit space. A typical example is the classification o...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this article}} is to {{introduce}} the notion of integral and geodesic flows on P-supermanifolds as certain partial actions of R. First I introduce the concept of parametrization over a `small' super algebra P, which leads to the notion of P-objects and is superized local deformation theory. It is shown how parametrization makes the theory much easier. A version of Palais' theorem for P-supermanifolds is obtained stating that every infinitesimal <b>P-action</b> of a simply connected P-super Lie group G on a P-supermanifold can be integrated to a whole action of G. Furthermore the faithful linearization of affine P-supermorphisms is proven. Finally I show that Newton's, Lagrange's and Hamilton's approach to mechanics can be formulated also for P- Riemannian supermanifolds and are infact equivalent. Comment: 37 pages, no figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} novel control {{framework}} for bilateral teleoperation {{of a pair}} of multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) nonlinear robotic systems under constant communication delays. The proposed framework utilizes the simple proportional-derivative (PD) control, i. e. the master and slave robots are directly connected via spring and damper over the delayed communication channels. Using the controller passivity concept, the Lyapunov-Krasovskii technique, and Parseval’s identity, we can passify the combination of the delayed communication and control blocks altogether robustly, as long as the delays are finite constants and an upper-bound for the round-trip delay is known. Having explicit position feedback through the delayed <b>P-action,</b> the proposed framework enforces master-slave position coordination which is often compromised in the velocity-based schemes (e. g. conventional scattering-based teleoperation). The proposed control framework provides humans with extended physiological proprioception so that s/he can affect and sense the remote slave environments mainly relying on her/his musculoskeletal systems. Experiments are performed to validate the proposed control framework. I...|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} sensorless {{control of}} a piezoelectric tube actuator to avoid the expense and practical limits of displacement sensors in nanopositioning. Three electrical signals {{have been used to}} estimate displacement: the piezoelectric voltage, the induced voltage and the sensing voltage. In this work, the piezoelectric voltage was employed to estimate displacement which does not require drift removal like the sensing voltage and does not suffer from a time lag respect to displacement like the induced voltage. This signal is the actuating signal at the same time, so the sensorless control system is feedforward. It was shown the relationship between the piezoelectric actuator and displacement is nearly linear at the designated operation area: excitation of the tube by triangular voltage functions with the magnitude up to 60 V and the frequency up to 60 Hz. Therefore, Internal Model Control (IMC) was employed to design this feedforward controller based on a second order linear discrete model which maps the piezoelectric voltage into displacement. The performance of the proposed feedforward controller has been compared with a well-tuned feedforward <b>P-action</b> controller and a remarkable improvement has been observed.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the {{analysis}} of human actions by comparing different performances of the same action executed by different actors. Specifically, we present a comparison procedure applied to the walking action, but the scheme {{can be applied to}} other different actions, such as bending, running, etc. To achieve fair comparison results, we define a novel human body model based on joint angles, which maximizes the differences between human postures and, moreover, reflects the anatomical structure of human beings. Subsequently, a human action space, called aSpace, is built in order to represent each performance (i. e., each predefined sequence of postures) as a parametric manifold. The final human action representation is called <b>p–action,</b> which is based on the most characteristic human body postures found during several walking performances. These postures are found automatically by means of a predefined distance function, and they are called key-frames. By using key-frames, we synchronize any performance with respect to the p– action. Furthermore, by considering an arc length parameterization, independence from the speed at which performances are played is attained. As a result, the style of human walking can be successfully analysed by establishing the differences of the joints between a male and a female walkers...|$|E
40|$|We study embeddings of a graph G in {{a surface}} S by {{considering}} representatives of different classes of H_ 1 (S) and their intersections. We construct a matrix invariant {{that can be}} used to detect homological invariance of elements of the cycle space of a cellularly embedded graph. We show that: for each positive integer n, there is a graph embeddable in the torus such that there is a free Z_ 2 <b>p-action</b> on the graph that extends to a cellular automorphism of the torus; for an odd prime p greater than 5 the Generalized Petersen Graphs of the form GP(2 p, 2) do cellularly embed in the torus, but not in such a way that a free-action of a group on GP(2 p, 2) extends to a cellular automorphism of the torus; the Generalized Petersen Graph GP(6, 2) does embed in the the torus such that a free-action of a group on GP(6, 2) extends to a cellular automorphism of the torus; and we show that for any odd q, the Generalized Petersen Graph GP(2 q, 2) does embed in the Klein bottle in such a way that a free-action of a group on the graph extends to a cellular automorphism of the Klein bottle.

40|$|In this work, {{a hybrid}} feedforward-feedback control system is {{proposed}} {{and used to}} control the temperature of an infrared batch dryer. Initially, the concept of control equilibrium point is introduced for control system which is {{the point that the}} control error and all its derivatives equal zero. The control command at this point is called “steady state control command”. Originally, this method requires the mathematical model of the system; however, a static artificial neural network (ANN) was designed and trained {{to play the role of}} feedforward control law. With a simple <b>P-action</b> feedback controller, the stability of the system is proved with no limit on the value of the controller gain. It means that the controller gain can be arbitrarily high without harming the stability and the temperature can converge towards the reference value as quick as possible (considering actuators’ limit). The actuator is a halogen lamp in this research. In practice, there is a dead-time of 1. 3 s in this system which prevents the proposed hybrid control system to work perfectly. A predictive approach is employed to solve this problem. A dynamic neural network is designed to simulate the behaviour of the dryer. The sampling time is 0. 1 s, so 13 consequent ANNs are employed for the purpose of predictive control. This predictive system predicts the temperature of the dryer 1. 3 s in advance, so the dead-time is compensated and the stability proof remains valid. The merit of the proposed hybrid control method is verified experimentally. Morteza Mohammadzaheri, Ali Mirsepahi, Mehdi Ghanbari, Lei Chen[URL]...|$|E
