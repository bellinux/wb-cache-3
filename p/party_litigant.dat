40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} case characteristics {{on the behavior of}} Norwegian Supreme Court justices when the state appears as a party in civil cases. Acting as the highest court of appeal, the Supreme Court has jurisdiction in all areas of law, and hears cases that raise matters of principle beyond the actual case itself, where the law is unclear. Statistically, the Supreme Court decides cases in favor of the state more often than private <b>party</b> <b>litigants.</b> This fact has led to debate within the legal community, over whether or not the court is placing greater emphasis on the state's interests than what follows from the legal doctrine. While research on Norwegian Supreme Court justices has produced important insights about the effects of individual justice characteristics, little is known about how aspects of the actual cases affects judicial behavior. Here, I investigate variables connected to case categories and importance, results from lower courts, the character of the different parties and their legal counsel. Using a multilevel model that control the effects of these case characteristics against panel effects connected to the collegial nature of the court, and also includes the individual characteristics of the justices, all 834 cases with 4170 justice votes between 1963 and 2014 are analyzed. Firstly, the results show that the history of the case matters: In cases where the state party won in both the District Courts and the Courts of Appeal, the justices are more probable to vote in favor of that party. This effect is not evident for private parties with the same case history. Secondly, the Ministry of Finance is identified as a uniquely strong plaintiff. Differently from other actors, an appeal from the Ministry of Finance increases the probability of the justices to vote in favor of the state. Additionally, the analysis confirms the existence of panel effects and individual effects on the Supreme Court: In panels where justices with former employment with the Legislation Department make up the majority, all justices are more likely to vote in favor of the state. Individual justices with former employment with the Legislation Department or the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, interim justices and former lower court justices are more likely to vote for the state party. Former law professors and the chief justices are more likely to vote in favor of the private party.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to test the state {{friendly}} hypothesis by comparing and integrating three different approaches {{to the study of}} judicial behavior in a hierarchical regression analysis. Decisions of the Norwegian Supreme Court in civil cases tend to favor the state over private <b>party</b> <b>litigants.</b> Acting as a court of last resort, only cases where the decision will have an impact beyond the case in question are adjudicated by the Supreme Court. By definition the sources of law do not point to a single indisputable solution in these cases. The question is whether these sources of law can be shaped to conform to a justice's desired outcome through preference initiated behavior. Based on the assumption that law is not the sole determinant of judicial decisions in the Supreme Court the following research question is established: What factors can explain the decisions of Supreme Court justices when the state is a party? Building on theoretical and analytical frameworks from the literature on judicial behavior an integrated hierarchical model based on legal factors, attitudinal factors and strategic factors is developed in the theory-section of the thesis. This is an innovation in the social-science study of judicial decisions on the Norwegian Supreme Court, which thus far has failed to account for the strategic aspects and legal aspects of judicial decision-making. Another development presented in the thesis is the introduction of multilevel analysis as an analytical tool for the study of judicial decisions. The analysis is based on a two-level hierarchical generalized linear model where judges are nested in panels. 2, 217 justice-observations grouped in 445 panels are included in the analysis. Predictors are added both at level-one and level-two based on hypotheses established for each level in the hierarchical framework. The analysis identified seven significant predictors affecting the probability of voting for or against the state. Interestingly, the significant predictors included both individual-level explanatory factors and group-level explanatory factors. However, the expected relationship between a proxy for ideology and the justices' votes was not evident. The evidence supports the application of an integrated hierarchical model of judicial behavior in the analysis of judicial decisions. In unanimous decisions there is variance explained by the grouping structure in the data, which {{it is not possible to}} model in single-level analyses. Thus a hierarchical analytical framework is preferable to single-level analysis in studies including unanimous decisions...|$|R
40|$|The 1928 law of {{criminal}} procedure previously regulating proceedings {{in cases of}} juveniles did not clearly define the judicial status of parents and guardians in that proceedings. The scope of rights of those persons {{was considered to be}} narrow. They were supposed to be summoned before a court, provided that the service of the documents was not creating particular difficulties. Yet, the court was entitled to demand the obligatory appearance at the hearing, in case of evading that obligation coercive measures provided for witnesses were applied. At the trial, those persons wese vested with the right to make statements and motions. The new act of Oct, 26, 1982 bestowed those persons with the status of <b>litigant</b> <b>parties</b> and extended their rights in a considerable way. The rights of parents and guardians as parties in litigation are autonomous, resulting from the fact of a defined consanguinity or from excercising a guardianship upon a juvenile, established judicially or existing factually. They are not resulting from the statutory representation of a juvenile. Parents and guardians as the <b>litigant</b> <b>parties</b> act in their own name and not {{in the name of a}} juvenile, they do not also have to act on his behalf although they usually do so, the results of their acts do not have to concern a juvenile, as parents and guardians can act in the proceedings in their own favor. It is a different question that usually there is a commutation observed m the roles of a <b>litigant</b> <b>party</b> and a statutory representative of a juvenile whose case is under trial. Applying new judicial provisions is not simple though, as the judicial status of parents and guardiand as the <b>litigant</b> <b>parties</b> is presently determined by the three normative acts. Apart of the mentioned act of 1982 on proceedings in cases of juveniles the regulations provided in Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure has also to be applied. Provisions of civil law procedure of nonlitigious mode are employed in case of examination and clarification proceedings, in guardian's and educational proceedings, in cases of applying medical and educational measures and partly in appeal proceedings. But if the evidence taking acts are performed by the Citizens' Militia provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure must be applied then, irrespectively of the stage and mode of the proceedings. Provisions of that Code also apply in reformatory proceedings and partly in appeal proceedings if the decision of reformatory measure is being appealed against or if the appeal demands applying that measure, as well as in criminal proceedings when it is conducted against a juvenile on exceptional bases in cases defined in the act. The detailed discussion of the scope of rights and obligations of parents and guardians in the proceedings in cases of juveniles as well as various complexities observed in the new regulation can be found in the published article. The author discusses, among the other things, the acceptable direction of parents' and guardians' acts in the proceedings in cases of juveniles, concurrence with the status of injured party, measures to be applied directly to the parents as eg. imposition of a duty to redress the damage, caused by a juvenile, burdening with costs of the proceedings, etcDigitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|R

40|$|In {{limiting}} patent litigants’ {{access to}} the declaratory judgment remedy, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has primarily invoked the “actual controversy” requirement imposed by the U. S. Constitution and the federal Declaratory Judgment Act. However, an examination of Federal Circuit decisions {{and those of the}} district courts reveals that the courts have often confused, or blurred the distinction between, constitutional requirements and the discretion the Act affords the federal courts to decline to exercise jurisdiction. Specifically, the courts often attribute constitutional significance to factors that instead bear on policy. It is important to distinguish between jurisdictional limits and policy considerations when deciding justiciability issues in patent cases. Misapplication of the law, or even mere imprecision in the allocation of jurisdictional and prudential considerations, engenders confusion among the affected <b>parties</b> – <b>litigants</b> and potential litigants – who then bear the costs of this confusion in the form of uncertainty, higher litigation expenses, and forgone opportunities.

Nothing, however, stopped jurors from talking informally among {{themselves}} during the voting procedure and juries could be unruly, shouting out their disapproval or disbelief of things said by the litigants.

Another benefit of taking depositions is to preserve a witness's recollection while it is still fresh, since the trial may still be months or years away. When a witness's testimony in open court is inconsistent with that given at deposition, a party can introduce the deposition to impeach (or contradict) the witness. In the event a witness is unavailable for trial (usually because they are deceased, seriously ill, or live hundreds of miles away), their deposition may be read or played before the jury and made part of the record in the case, with the same legal force as live testimony. In some states, stenographic, audio, or video records of depositions can be offered into evidence even if the witness is available. Deposition of the opposite party {{is often used to}} produce self-incriminating statements from the deponent, also document identification questions can make exhibits admissible for hearings and summary judgment motions.|$|R
