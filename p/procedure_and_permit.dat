A smart city paradigm was conceived with the aim to integrate technology development with different functions/component like sustainable mobility, energy management and water quality. In this paper we propose a novel water sanitization method based on the combination of the classical bioremediation approach with the use of electric boat. The proposed boat must be equipped with echo sounding, G. P. S. sensor and suitable injector. Furthermore it is provided of medium size energy storage systems and power generation from renewable source in order to ensure a completely environmentally friendly mode of operation. The use of this vessel allows to reduce the operating cost of sanitization <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> <b>permit</b> to integrate a technique for the improvement {{of the quality of the}} water in the contest of the Smart City.

Suitable microorganisms were distributed on three equally spaced points of the basin by meas of a prototype electric boat. The same points were used to monitor the some parameters used to validate the proposed strategy.

40|$|Purpose: To analyze {{postoperative}} complications after laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC) {{and evaluate}} its risk factors {{in a large}} prospective cohort built by the ESUT across European centers involved in minimally invasive urology in the last decade. Methods: Patients were prospectively enrolled, and data were retrospectively analyzed. Only oncologic cases were included. There were no formal contraindications for LRC: Also patients with locally advanced tumors (pT 4 a), serious comorbidities, and previous major abdominal surgery were enrolled. All procedures were performed via a standard laparoscopic approach, with no robotic assistance. Early and late postoperative complications were graded according to the modified Clavien–Dindo classification. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to explore possible risk factors for developing complications. Results: A total of 548 patients were available for final analysis, of which 258 (47  %) experienced early complications during the first 90  days after LRC. Infectious, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary were, respectively, the most frequent systems involved. Postoperative ileus occurred in 51 / 548 (9. 3  %) patients. A total of 65 / 548 (12  %) patients underwent surgical re-operation, and 10 / 548 (2  %) patients died in the early postoperative period. Increased BMI (p =  0. 024), blood loss (p =  0. 021), and neoadjuvant treatment (p =  0. 016) {{were significantly associated with}} a greater overall risk of experiencing complications on multivariate logistic regression. Long-term complications were documented in 64 / 548 (12  %), and involved mainly stenosis of the uretero-ileal anastomosis or incisional hernias. Conclusions: In this multicenter, prospective, large database, LRC appears to be a safe but morbid procedure. Standardized complication reporting should be encouraged to evaluate objectively a surgical <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> <b>permit</b> comparison across studies.

The internal length scales derived from damping effects, which are typical for the viscoplastic models, and the wave length, obtained from the critical wave number for which the wave speed is not imaginary, are used together to give a prediction of the internal length scale of the combined model.

40|$|Chemical library {{technology}} plays {{a central}} role in research areas such as drug discovery and gene screening. 1 The most powerful combinatorial library synthesis method is the iterative “split and mix” synthesis on insoluble microscopic beads. 2 This technique is an efficient method for accessing all combinations of chosen monomers such as nucleic acids, amino acids, or sugars in a small number of reactions. Compound identification from such large pools of compounds, be it bound to resin (one compound per bead) or in solution, is achieved through covalent attachment of molecular tags to the beads 3 or through iterative deconvolution technologies. 4 Herein we introduce an encoding method that involves physically attaching fluorescent colloidal particles (“reporters”) to the surface of solid support beads during split and mix syntheses, to produce an information-rich, colored barcode that can be easily, rapidly, and inexpensively decoded using fluorescence microscopy.

Thus, correct pain {{management in the}} first days after surgery seems mandatory to avoid these problems. Once the stiffness has been diagnosed, several options are available depending on its severity and cause and on the delay between the surgical <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> the diagnosis. Closed manipulation is indicated in the first 2 – 3  weeks after surgery [27, 28]. It allows the fibrous bands that develop in the joint and suprapatellar pouch to be broken. In the case of correct indications, it guarantees satisfactory results [31 – 33]. Surgical options may be proposed after 6 – 12  weeks of a correct rehabilitation program. Arthroscopic arthrolysis is indicated in the case of stiff and pain-free knees. It is a good option, since it is a minimally invasive <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> <b>permits</b> lysis of fibrous bands, PCL release, and removal of loose bodies. Unfortunately, clinical results are controversial and its indication is limited in severe cases [35 – 38].

In this research the suitability of those characterization experiments for the derivation of precise fabric parameters for virtual computations is studied.

Both methods have been studied, compared and the main fabric {{input parameters}} for virtual simulations derived. Depending on the complexity of the computation system, the mechanical properties, which are mainly responsible for the fabric behaviour, are modelled either linear or non-linear.

The FAST method uses simpler <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>permits</b> only the linear interpretation of the measured data.

40|$|DNA microarrays {{have become}} one of the most {{powerful}} tools in the field of genomics and medical diagnosis. Recently, there has been increased interest in combining microfluidics with microarrays since this approach offers advantages in terms of portability, reduced analysis time, low consumption of reagents, and increased system integration. Polymers are widely used for microfluidic systems, but fabrication of microarrays on such materials often requires complicated chemical surface modifications, which hinders the integration of microarrays into microfluidic systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that simple UV irradiation can be used to directly immobilize poly(T) poly(C) -tagged DNA oligonucleotide probes on many different types of plastics without any surface modification. On average, five- and fourfold improvement in immobilization and hybridization efficiency have been achieved compared to surface-modified slides with aminated DNA probes. Moreover, the TC tag only costs 30 % of the commonly used amino group modifications. Using this microarray fabrication technique, a portable cyclic olefin copolymer biochip containing eight individually addressable microfluidic channels was developed and used for rapid and parallel identification of Avian Influenza Virus by DNA hybridization. The one-step, cost-effective DNA-linking method on non-modified polymers significantly simplifies microarray fabrication <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>permits</b> great flexibility to plastic material selection, thus making it convenient to integrate microarrays into plastic microfluidic systems...|$|R

Using a new mapping {{system that}} allows the {{simultaneous}} acquisition of date from 25 right atrial bipolar electrodes during cardiac catheterization, we mapped normal sinus rhythm and atrial reentrant tachycardia in 24 sheep (20 to 49 kg) and 7 pigs (25 to 35 kg). Background. Rapid, high resolution mapping during cardiac catheterization may shorten ablation <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>permit</b> ablation of otherwise refractory arrhythmias. Methods. A flexible, elliptic, basket-shaped recording catheter has five spokes, each with 10 electrodes arranged as 5 bipolar pairs. Catheter shape, electrode spacing and introduction technique were modified {{in response to the}} results of experiments in the first 23 animals. In the most recent eight animals, retraction of a string attached to the distal tip distended the basket, providing safe tissue contact. Filtered (30 to 250 Hz) bipolar recordings from all 25 electrode pairs, as well as a surface electrocardiogram, were recorded and digitized at 1, 000 Hz using custom software. An activation map was digitally constructed and superimposed on anteroposterior and lateral fluoroscopic catheter images. Bipolar recordings were made in normal sinus rhythm (31 animals), with adequate signals recorded from > 95 % of electrode pairs. Rapid burst pacing and intentional right atrial air embolus (30 to 50 ml) induced sustained atrial reentrant tachycardia in five animais, which was also adequately recorded. Results. Catheter positioning and complete atrial mapping required < 10 min after venous access in the most recent eight experiments. The catheter was left in position for up to 4 h.
