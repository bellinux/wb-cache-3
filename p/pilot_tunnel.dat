25|$|Construction of {{the tunnel}} started at the western end on 15 January 1969 with the {{excavation}} of the approach cutting which reached 25 m deep at the portal. A layer of alluvial material at the tunnel face meant that this section had to be excavated by hand, first as a small <b>pilot</b> <b>tunnel,</b> later being enlarged to the final size.|$|E
25|$|In September 1971, the {{decision}} was made to commence work on the tunnel. A Shinkansen-capable cross section was selected, with plans to extend the Shinkansen network. Arduous construction in difficult geological conditions proceeded. 34 workers were killed during construction. On 27 January 1983, Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone pressed a switch that set off a blast that completed the <b>pilot</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Similarly on 10 March 1985, Minister of Transport Tokuo Yamashita symbolically bored through the main tunnel.|$|E
500|$|The first {{engineering}} work {{to take place}} was a compressed air driven <b>pilot</b> <b>tunnel,</b> which was drilled between 1936 and 1938. Work on the tunnel was delayed due to World War II, and resumed in 1959, using a Greathead Shield, similar to {{the work on the}} Blackwall Tunnel some 60 years earlier. The delay in work due to the war allowed the tunnel's design to be improved, which included a better ventilation system. After negotiations with the Ministry of Transport, Kent and Essex County Councils obtained government approval to charge tolls in 1960, before opening. The two-lane bore tunnel opened to traffic on 18 November 1963; the total project cost was £13 million (£ million as of [...] ) and it initially served approximately 12,000 vehicles per day.|$|E
25|$|The two {{headings}} of {{the tunnel}} workings met on 4 June 1976 when two <b>pilot</b> <b>tunnels</b> were drilled through {{to the other side}} to check the alignment. Though the official hole-through ceremony had been planned for 17 June, the dignitaries had to be content with shovelling some of the rubble as the TBM had again jammed with loose rock. Mr. L. Dillon, a project supervisor, became the first person to walk the tunnel end-to-end on 21 June.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{possibility}} of installing Gas Insulated transmission Lines (with acronym GIL) in dedicated or shared structures. The applications involve railway galleries (both in the proper galleries and in service or <b>pilot</b> <b>tunnels),</b> highway networks, gas lines. The high GIL power capability together with very low power losses configures these applications as high transmission efficiency corridors. Some issues of this application will be shown in this paper (steady-state regime of the line, voltage drops, power losses, voltage unbalance factor, ampacity, electro-magnetic field impact and limit lengths) : moreover, the paper discusses the necessary studies to be carried out and the problems that have to be faced in order to develop this kind of application towards a feasible technical solution...|$|R
50|$|The tunnels {{were also}} used during World War II as an {{operations}} bunker by the No. 1 Fighter Sector RAAF. The bunker was located in what {{was intended to be}} the City Inner Tunnel, access to which was provided by a wooden staircase in a shaft leading upward to Shakespeare Place. Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF) personnel housed in this operations bunker collected information from radar and weather stations, as well as reports on air traffic, ship and troop movements collected from airports, army and Volunteer Air Observer Corps reporting posts. This section of tunnel was constructed using a cut and cover technique outside St James station, and connects to the tunnels in St James through <b>pilot</b> <b>tunnels,</b> accessible via ladder.|$|R
500|$|Station {{reconstruction}} {{to accommodate}} the Victoria line was described as the most time-consuming for the Victoria line project. To handle the additional Victoria line passenger loads, a new ticket hall was constructed directly under the road junction. Separate banks of escalators to each line were to be built, with the existing structure {{to be used as}} exits with The lifts to be removed. A new one-way interchange subways system was to be built between the Bakerloo/Victoria lines and the Central line. To excavate the new ticket hall below the roadway, traffic was diverted for {{five and a half years}} (August 1963 to Easter 1968) onto a temporary bridge-like structure known as the [...] "umbrella" [...] covering the Regent Street/Oxford Street intersection. It consisted of 245 pieces of separate prefabricated steel work. The deck plates were placed on top of a system of steel girders which in turn rested on 25 cylindrical 3ft diameter concrete foundations, sunk from 43 up to 73ft deep at night. The cylindrical piles had to clear the sites of the main and secondary roof beams of the new ticket hall and various low-level obstructions. The piles had to be built with wide footings to avoid them from collapsing. Service tunnels were constructed to carry water mains and telecom cables past the new ticket hall. The umbrella deck was extended eastwards along Oxford Street to facilitate the construction of a connecting passageway between the old and new ticket halls during the weekend of the August Bank Holiday in 1966. Construction of the Victoria line station tunnels with their platforms, the new escalator shafts and the linking passages to the Central line platforms was carried out from access shafts sunk from nearby Cavendish Square, Upper Regent Street and Argyll Street. For the construction of the southbound Victoria line platform tunnel, a special design of tunnel segment, fabricated with mild steel was adopted as there was limited space available for the construction of the platform tunnel. A pre-stressed concrete raft was constructed below the Peter Robinson's third basement level as an extra precaution against settlement before driving the platform tunnel. The interchange passageway between the Central line and the Bakerloo line in the area of the former junction with the Bakerloo line lift landing was replaced by the southbound Victoria line platform tunnel. From there, a <b>pilot</b> <b>tunnel</b> Ventilation systems were rearranged with a new ventilation plant installed in the former Bakerloo line lift shaft. A new substation for the Bakerloo line was built at the bottom of the shaft. With the additional escalators in place, the one-way circulation scheme was introduced and the remaining lifts were removed.|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{geological}} investigation occurred from 1946 to 1963, {{which involved}} drilling the sea-bed, sonic surveys, submarine boring, observations using a mini-submarine, and seismic and magnetic surveys. To establish a greater understanding, a horizontal pilot boring was undertaken {{along the line}} of the service and main tunnels. Tunnelling occurred simultaneously from the northern end and the southern. The dry land portions were tackled with traditional mountain tunnelling techniques, with a single main tunnel. However, for the 23.3-kilometre undersea portion, three bores were excavated with increasing diameters respectively: an initial <b>pilot</b> <b>tunnel,</b> a service tunnel, and finally the main tunnel. The service tunnel was periodically connected to the main tunnel with a series of connecting shafts, at 600- to 1,000-metre intervals. The <b>pilot</b> <b>tunnel</b> serves as the service tunnel for the central five-kilometre portion. Beneath the Tsugaru Strait, the use of a tunnel boring machine (TBM) was abandoned after less than two kilometres (...) owing to the variable nature of the rock and difficulty in accessing the face for advanced grouting. Blasting with dynamite and mechanical picking were then used to excavate.|$|E
2500|$|In 1805–09 a {{group of}} Cornish miners, {{including}} Richard Trevithick, tried to dig a tunnel farther upriver between Rotherhithe and Wapping/Limehouse but failed because of the difficult conditions of the ground. The Cornish miners were used to hard rock and did not modify their methods for soft clay and quicksand. This Thames Archway project was abandoned after the initial <b>pilot</b> <b>tunnel</b> (a 'driftway') flooded twice when 1,000feet (305m) {{of a total of}} 1,200feet (366m) had been dug. It only measured 2–3feet by 5feet (61–91cm by 1.5m), and was intended as the drain for a larger tunnel for passenger use. The failure of the Thames Archway project led engineers to conclude that [...] "an underground tunnel is impracticable".|$|E
5000|$|The first tunnel {{under the}} River Mersey {{was for the}} Mersey Railway in 1886. The first tunnel {{crossing}} was proposed in 1825 and, again in 1827. A report in 1830 rejected the road tunnel due to concerns about building damage. During the 1920s there were concerns about the long queues of cars and lorries at the Mersey Ferry terminal so once Royal Assent to a Parliamentary Bill was received construction of the first Mersey Road Tunnel started in 1925, to a design by consulting engineer Sir Basil Mott. Mott supervised the construction in association with John Brodie, who, as City Engineer of Liverpool, had co-ordinated the feasibility studies made by consultant Engineers Mott, Hay and Anderson. The main contractor was Edmund Nuttall. In 1928 the two <b>pilot</b> <b>tunnels</b> met to within less than 25 mm.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To assess {{distance}} changes {{between the}} femoral and tibial attachment points of 3 different {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) tunnel entry positions throughout the range of knee motion in cadaveric knees. Methods. The ACLs of 11 fresh-frozen cadaveric knees (from 6 men and 5 women) were removed using radiofrequency. Three tibial tunnel placements were made using a cannulated awl, and three 2. 4 -mm <b>pilot</b> <b>tunnels</b> were drilled on the lateral femoral condyle. One end of an inelastic suture was inserted {{from each of the}} 3 femoral holes and fixed on the femoral cortex using a suture button in turn, whereas {{the other end of the}} suture was passed through the cannulated awl and fixed on each of the 3 tibial placements in turn, with constant tension.

2500|$|Around 1866, William Low and Sir John Hawkshaw {{promoted}} ideas, but {{apart from}} preliminary geological studies none were implemented. An official Anglo-French protocol was established in 1876 for a cross-Channel railway tunnel. In 1881, the British railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin and Alexandre Lavalley, a French Suez Canal contractor, were in the Anglo-French Submarine Railway Company that conducted exploratory work {{on both sides of}} the Channel. On the English side a [...] diameter Beaumont-English boring machine dug a [...] <b>pilot</b> <b>tunnel</b> from Shakespeare Cliff. On the French side, a similar machine dug [...] from Sangatte. The project was abandoned in May 1882, owing to British political and press campaigns asserting that a tunnel would compromise Britain's national defences. These early works were encountered more than a century later during the TML project.|$|E
2500|$|Surveying {{undertaken}} in the 20 years before construction confirmed earlier speculations that a tunnel could be bored through a chalk marl stratum. The chalk marl is conducive to tunnelling, with impermeability, ease of excavation and strength. The chalk marl runs along {{the entire length of}} the English side of the tunnel, but on the French side a length of [...] has variable and difficult geology. The tunnel consists of three bores: two [...] diameter rail tunnels, [...] apart, [...] in length with a [...] diameter service tunnel in between. The three bores are connected by cross-passages and piston relief ducts. The service tunnel was used as a <b>pilot</b> <b>tunnel,</b> boring ahead of the main tunnels to determine the conditions. English access was provided at Shakespeare Cliff, French access from a shaft at Sangatte. The French side used five tunnel boring machines (TBMs), the English side six. The service tunnel uses Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) and Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS). Fire safety was a critical design issue.|$|E
