5|$|The {{center field}} fence at Cleveland's Dunn Field was 460 feet from home plate {{until it was}} {{shortened}} to 420 feet in 1920. Even so, Speaker played so shallow in the outfield {{that he was able}} to execute six career unassisted double plays at second base, catching low line drives on the run and then beating baserunners to the bag. At least once he was credited as the <b>pivot</b> <b>man</b> in a routine double play. He was often shallow enough to catch pickoff throws at second base. At one point, Speaker's signature move was to come in behind second base on a bunt and make a tag play on a baserunner who had passed the bag.|$|E

6000|$|Now, {{that is a}} discriminating {{portrait}}--a portrait {{which really}} helps you to see that which the writer sets out to describe. After reading it one can understand why even in reminiscent sporting descriptions of those old days, amid all the Tonis and Bills and Jacks, it is always Mr. John Jackson. He was the friend and instructor of Byron and of half the bloods in town. Jackson it was who, {{in the heat of}} combat, seized the Jew Mendoza by the hair, and so ensured that the pugs for ever afterwards should be a close-cropped race. Inside you see the square face of old Broughton, the supreme fighting man of the eighteenth century, the man whose humble ambition it was to begin with the <b>pivot</b> <b>man</b> of the Prussian Guard, and work his way through the regiment. He had a chronicler, the good Captain Godfrey, who has written some English which would take some beating. How about this passage?-- ...|$|E
5000|$|Auburn's {{yearbook}} The Glomerata {{says this}} of Caton: [...] "a combination of center and tackle {{that is hard}} to beat. He has fought against <b>pivot</b> <b>men</b> of all calibres and none of them have been able to put anything over his sector." ...|$|R
60|$|Even as {{the thought}} flashed through his brain he {{received}} a heavy blow {{on the side of}} his head that nearly knocked him down. It was a man's fist, directed by a man so angry and in such haste that the fist had missed the jaw for which it was aimed. Martin turned as he staggered, and saw the fist coming at him in a wild swing. Quite as a matter of course he ducked, and the fist flew harmlessly past, <b>pivoting</b> the <b>man</b> who had driven it. Martin hooked with his left, landing on the <b>pivoting</b> <b>man</b> with the weight of his body behind the blow. The man went to the ground sidewise, leaped to his feet, and made a mad rush. Martin saw his passion-distorted face and wondered what could be the cause of the fellow's anger. But while he wondered, he shot in a straight left, the weight of his body behind the blow. The man went over backward and fell in a crumpled heap. Jimmy and others of the gang were running toward them.|$|R
2500|$|In the Chicago Daily Tribune, Walter Eckersall picked an All-Western {{team that}} {{included}} four Wolverines as first-team players. [...] The Michigan players receiving first-team honors from Eckersall were Benbrook, Allerdice, Magidsohn (who he called [...] "a demon on the offense"), and center Andrew W. Smith. [...] In announcing his selection of Smith, Eckersall wrote: [...] "Smith {{is by far}} the best center in this section. [...] Yost experimented with this player until the Pennsylvania game ... Finally, as a last resort the coach tried him at center, where he proved {{to be one of the}} finds of the season. [...] He is a hard, aggressive player, who does not know the meaning of the word quit. ... With more experience he should develop into one of the best <b>pivot</b> <b>men</b> the west has ever produced." ...|$|R
6000|$|I had {{expected}} to see half that regiment of horse lying on the ground; but whether it was that their breastplates had shielded them, or whether, being young and a little shaken at their coming, we had fired high, our volley had done no very great harm. About thirty horses lay about, three of them together within ten yards of me, the middle one right on its back with its four legs in the air, {{and it was one}} of these that I had seen flapping through the smoke. Then there were eight or ten dead men and about as many wounded, sitting dazed on the grass for the most part, though one was shouting [...] "Vive l'Empereur!" [...] at the top of his voice. Another fellow who had been shot in the thigh--a great black-moustached chap he was too--leaned his back against his dead horse and, picking up his carbine, fired as coolly as if he had been shooting for a prize, and hit Angus Myres, who was only two from me, right through the forehead. Then he out with his hand to get another carbine that lay near, but before he could reach it big Hodgson, who was the <b>pivot</b> <b>man</b> of the Grenadier company, ran out and passed his bayonet through his throat, which was a pity, for he seemed to be a very fine man.|$|E

5000|$|For the 2007/2008 season Bosna was {{reinforced}} by three new players. Muhamed Mustafić, a right wing, returned to his parent club after playing 3 successful seasons in HC Bosna Sarajevo which competed successfully in the EHF Champions League, and later the EHF Cup Winner's Cup where they played semi-finals. Kenan Ahić, on loan to the Sarajevo side last season returned to Visoko. The third player is Aldin Begagić, a <b>pivot</b> <b>men</b> from Krivaja and later Goražde. [...] In {{the first round of}} EHF Cup Bosna played against handball club Sutjeska from Nikšić, and passed after playing draw match in Nikšić, and scored win in Visoko. Result in Nikšić was 21-21, but in Visoko home team Bosna defeated Montenegrin side by 38-27. In second round Bosna was defeated by Gold Club from Slovenia. The first game in Slovenia was a draw (37-37), but the Slovenians managed to defeat the Bosnian side at home, and went through.|$|R

He was recruited {{out of high}} school in Canada and spent three years of residency before suiting up for the Green Archers in 2011. The next year (his second playing year in UAAP), he was the Archers' starting center, often paired with Fil-German center Arnold Van Opstal. With him and Van Opstal in the <b>pivot</b> spot <b>manning</b> the boards, they clinched the UAAP championship in 2013.|$|R
50|$|XI-inch Dahlgren shell gun: 465 {{were cast}} at Alger; Builders; Fort Pitt; Hinkley, Williams & Co.; Portland Locomotive Works; Seyfert, McManus & Co.; Trenton Iron Works; and West Point {{foundries}} between 1856 and 1864. This {{is the only}} Dahlgren gun to have been designed both with and without a muzzle swell. The gun was typically mounted on a pivot or in a turret on a monitor. When mounted in a turret, the crew for an XI-inch Dahlgren was seven including powdermen. The crew for the gun when mounted on a <b>pivot</b> was 24 <b>men</b> and a powderman. XI-inch Dahlgrens were carried on Neosho, Marietta, Casco, Milwaukee, and (1 XI-inch and 1 XV-inch short) class monitors {{as well as the}} original USS Monitor. The USS Kearsarge, USS Powhatan, and many other conventional ships carried XI-inch Dahlgrens on pivot mounts. A few larger river gunboats, such as USS Tuscumbia and USS Indianola also carried XI-inch Dahlgrens.|$|R
5000|$|This reeve {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "the <b>pivot</b> <b>man</b> of the manorial system". He had to oversee the work which the peasants were bound to perform, as an obligation attached to their holding of land in the Manor, for the lord of the manor on the demesne land; such reeves acted generally as the overseer of the serfs and peasants on the estate. He was also responsible for many aspects of the finances of the manor such as the sale of produce, collection of monies and payment of accounts.|$|E

5000|$|The Prostate Cancer Intervention versus Observation Trial (<b>PIVOT)</b> {{randomized}} 731 <b>men</b> {{diagnosed with}} localized prostate cancer to radical prostatectomy or observation (mean age 67 years; median PSA 7.8 ng/ml). [...] In the observation group, bone metastases and prostate cancer death occurred in 10.6% and 8.4%, respectively through 12 years. Death from prostate cancer occurred in 5.7% and 17.4% of men diagnosed with Gleason score below 7 and 7 and above, respectively; and 6.2% and 12.8% {{of men with}} a PSA of 10 ng/ml or below and above 10 ng/ml, respectively. Stratified by D’Amico risk groups (see Prostate Cancer Risk Stratification Table at right for explanation), death from prostate cancer occurred in 2.7%, 10.8%, and 17.5% of men with low, intermediate, and high risk disease, respectively. Recognizing that <b>men</b> in the <b>PIVOT</b> study {{were more likely to}} have been diagnosed as a result of PSA based testing as compared to men in the SPGS-4 who were not, it is of interest that cumulative deaths from prostate cancer in the SPGS-4 among men with low risk disease (11%) is comparable to that of men with intermediate risk disease (10.8%) in PIVOT. These data suggest that the outcomes for men with low risk disease in the pre PSA era are comparable with those of men today diagnosed with intermediate risk disease.|$|R
5000|$|Born in 1871 James Weldon Johnson made {{observations}} of a cakewalk at {{a ball in}} his novel The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man. However, it was {{at one of these}} balls that I first saw the cake-walk. There was a contest for a gold watch, to be awarded to the hotel head-waiter receiving the greatest number of votes. There was some dancing while the votes were being counted. Then the floor was cleared for the cake-walk. A half-dozen guests from some of the hotels took seats on the stage to act as judges, and twelve or fourteen couples began to walk for a sure enough, highly decorated cake, which was in plain evidence. The spectators crowded about the space reserved for the contestants and watched them with interest and excitement. The couples did not walk round in a circle, but in a square, with the men on the inside. The fine points to be considered were the bearing of the men, the precision with which they turned the corners, the grace of the women, and the ease with which they swung around the <b>pivots.</b> The <b>men</b> walked with stately and soldierly step, and the women with considerable grace. The judges arrived at their decision by a process of elimination. The music and the walk continued for some minutes; then both were stopped while the judges conferred; when the walk began again, several couples were left out. In this way the contest was finally narrowed down to three or four couples. Then the excitement became intense; there was much partisan cheering as one couple or another would execute a turn in extra elegant style. When the cake was finally awarded, the spectators were about evenly divided between those who cheered the winners and those who muttered about the unfairness of the judges. This was the cake-walk in its original form, and it is what the colored performers on the theatrical stage developed into the prancing movements now known all over the world, and which some Parisian critics pronounced the acme of poetic motion.

5000|$|In 2015, {{some of the}} {{erstwhile}} CAG members regrouped as I-PAC (Indian Political Action Committee) under Kishor's mentorship {{and started}} working with Nitish Kumar, the two-time Chief Minister of Bihar who was seeking a third term in Assembly Elections 2015. Prior to a formal announcement or launch of the election campaign, media was buzzing with speculation. Vasudha Gopal in her article for The Economic Times was {{the one of the}} first journalists who broke [...] "Prashant Kishor: <b>Man</b> <b>pivot</b> of PM Narendra Modi campaign in talks to help steer JD(U) in Bihar election". Calling him [...] "a man of technology and strategy", Venugopal wrote, [...] "Kishor, 37, one of the prime movers of Citizens for Accountable Governance, an outfit modelled on the US-style political action committees that act as force multipliers to political campaigns in that country, is all set to project and define Kumar as an antithesis of Modi in the upcoming Bihar elections, possibly using the very tools used to build up the former Gujarat chief minister to try and knock him down. His entry into the Bihar political arena could also herald a new form of campaigning replete with its strong reliance on data analytics, branding and communication strategies hitherto unseen in a state known more for complicated caste arithmetic and use of muscle to win elections". Speaking on the Bihar elections itself, she continues [...] "The upcoming elections in Bihar, political analysts reckon, are crucial and personal for both Kumar and Modi. For Modi, the Bihar elections, coming as they do after BJP's loss in the Delhi assembly poll, will mark a re-test of the 'Modi wave'. For Kumar, who broke off his party's long-term alliance with BJP in 2013 after the saffron party moved to project Modi as its PM candidate, a victory in the Bihar elections is essential for political survival. A victory could catapult Kumar as a possible national figure around whom all non-BJP, non-Congress parties could coalesce." [...] He has been hired by the Indian national Congress to fight the crucial state elections of 2016 and 2017, such as Punjab, Uttar Pradesh etc.|$|R
