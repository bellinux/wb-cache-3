40|$|AbstractObjectives: The interrelationships among {{coronary}} and valvular operations, microemboli, and neurobehavioral outcome are unclear. We {{hypothesized that}} adult patients undergoing cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> {{would have more}} total emboli delivered to the brain than patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and that this would associate with worse neurobehavioral outcomes. Methods: One hundred ninety-three patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and 73 patients undergoing cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> were compared. Patients received neurologic, neuro-ophthalmologic, and 11 standardized neurobehavioral tests preoperatively and 5 to 7 days, 1 month, and 6 months postoperatively. Left common carotid Doppler ultrasonographic embolus detection was performed intraoperatively. Repeated measures and logistic regression analyses of outcome were performed. Results: Patients undergoing either coronary or <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> were well matched by age (61 ± 10 and 59 ± 12 years, respectively), but a significantly greater fraction of patients undergoing <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> were female, diabetic, or had undergone previous cardiac operations. Neurobehavioral scores of patients undergoing either coronary artery bypass grafting or cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> {{did not differ significantly}} at any time. Total embolus counts differed significantly: the median was 105 during coronary artery bypass grafting and 479 during cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> (geometric means of 104 and 412, respectively; P =. 0001). Significantly more emboli were detected in the patients undergoing cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> after removal of the left ventricular vent and after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass, but comparable numbers of emboli were seen in the 2 groups before cardiopulmonary bypass. In both groups decreased neurobehavioral performance was apparent at 5 to 7 days, with improvement at 1 and 6 months. Increasing numbers of carotid emboli significantly associated with worse performance on the letter cancellation test. There {{were no significant differences between}} patients undergoing <b>valve</b> and coronary <b>operations</b> in neurobehavioral outcomes, strokes, transient ischemic attacks, or deaths. Conclusions: The significantly greater number of emboli in the group of patients undergoing cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> is likely the result of the entrainment of intracardiac air. The greater numbers of emboli during cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> do not appear associated with a commensurately greater risk of adverse neurologic or neurobehavioral outcome.

40|$|The water {{distribution}} regulation system of Fukuoka City {{is a system}} in which motor valves are operated by remote control while pressure gauges and flow meters attached to distribution pipes are monitored. One of the main objectives of this system is to regulate pressure in all the network nodes between lower and upper target values. With the ever-increasing complexity of the city-wide distribution pipe network, motor <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> to regulate pressure and flow came to depend more and more on the experience and skills of operators. For this reason, an improvement of <b>valve</b> <b>operations</b> support should be done based on <b>valve</b> <b>operation</b> planning for flow and pressure regulation and the operation knowledge database which is constructed on the basis of past experience in order to prevent the events of pressure regulation falls outside the required target pressure range and also to reduce the effort of operators. Therefore in this study and with the assistance of three years of telemetry data, an analysis of the existing <b>valve</b> <b>operation</b> of a certain block within the city district is performed using both correlation analysis and an unsupervised class of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) named Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). Results show that correlation analysis has successfully classified the operation types of different valves attached to the studied network into three categories while SOM is an efficient tool in clustering the different complicated operational patterns of valves, visualizing the huge amount of telemetry valves data, detecting the patterns which need future improvement and could present good alternative solutions for improving future valve operational support...|$|R

Patients with coronary artery bypass surgery are included in Group I (38 patients) and patients with <b>valve</b> <b>operation</b> are included in Group II (17 patients). CABG patients are further divided into two sub-groups as on-pump and off-pump. In both groups, homocystein, high sensitivity C reactive protein, ceruloplasmin, lipoprotein A and serum amyloid A protein levels are analyzed from blood and pericardial fluid.
