40|$|Genotype x {{environment}} interaction (G x E) {{is increasingly}} important, because breeding programs {{tend to be}} more internationally oriented. The aim of this theoretical study was to investigate the effects of G x E on genetic gain in sib-testing and <b>progeny-testing</b> schemes. Loss of genetic gain due to G x E was predicted for different values of heritability, number of progeny per dam, number of progeny per sire, proportion of selected sires, and population size in the selection environment. Two environments were considered: a selection environment (SLE) and a production environment (PDE). The breeding goal was only for performance in PDE. A pseudo-BLUP selection index was used to predict genetic gain. Recording of half-sibs or progeny in PDE limited the loss in genetic gain in PDE due to G x E between SLE and PDE. <b>Progeny-testing</b> schemes had less loss in genetic gain than sib-testing schemes. Higher heritability increased the loss in genetic gain, whereas increasing the number of progeny per sire in PDE decreased the loss in genetic gain. The number of progeny per sire required to minimize loss in genetic gain due to G x E was greater for sib-testing schemes than for <b>progeny-testing</b> schemes. More progeny per dam slightly increased the loss in genetic gain. Genetic gains for sex-limited and carcass traits were less affected by G x E than traits measured on both sexes. Loss in genetic gain was due to decreased accuracy of selection in most situations, but it was due to decreased selection intensity in situations with small population size and a low proportion of selected sires. It was concluded that recording performance of relatives in PDE minimizes loss in genetic gain due to G x E, and that <b>progeny-testing</b> schemes rather than sib-testing schemes are preferable in situations with low to moderate heritability (h(2) {{less than or equal to}} 0. 3), relatively short generation interval of progeny-tested sires (L-prog/L-sib less than or equal to 1. 7), and moderate to severe G x E interaction (r(g) less than or equal to 0. 8) ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the accuracy of genotype imputation from low (12 k) to medium (50 k Illumina-Ovine) SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) densities in purebred and crossbred Merino sheep based on a random or selected reference set and to evaluate the impact of using imputed genotypes on accuracy of genomic prediction. MethodsImputation validation sets were composed of random purebred or crossbred Merinos, while imputation reference sets were of variable sizes and included random purebred or crossbred Merinos or a group of animals that were selected based on high genetic relatedness to animals in the validation set. The Beagle software program was used for imputation and accuracy of imputation was assessed based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between observed and imputed genotypes. Genomic evaluation was performed based on genomic best linear unbiased prediction and its accuracy was evaluated as the Pearson correlation coefficient between genomic estimated breeding values using either observed (12 k/ 50 k) or imputed genotypes with varying levels of imputation accuracy and accurate estimated breeding values based on <b>progeny-tests.</b> ResultsImputation accuracy increased as the size of the reference set increased. However, accuracy was higher for purebred Merinos that were imputed from other purebred Merinos (on average 0. 90  to  0. 95 based on 1000  to  3000 animals) than from crossbred Merinos (0. 78  to  0. 87 based on 1000  to  3000 animals) or from non-Merino purebreds (on average 0. 50). The imputation accuracy for crossbred Merinos based on 1000 to  3000 other crossbred Merino ranged from 0. 86 to 0. 88. Considerably higher imputation accuracy was observed when a selected reference set with a high genetic relationship to target animals was used vs. a random reference set of the same size (0. 96 vs. 0. 88, respectively). Accuracy of genomic prediction based on 50 k genotypes imputed with high accuracy (0. 88  to  0. 99) decreased only slightly (0. 0  to  0. 67  % across traits) compared to using observed 50 k genotypes. Accuracy of genomic prediction based on observed 12 k genotypes was higher than accuracy based on lowly accurate (0. 62 to 0. 86) imputed 50 k genotypes...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate optimization of dairy {{cattle breeding}} programs for 2 environments with genotype × environment interaction. Breeding strategies differed in 1) including 1 or 2 environments in the breeding goal, 2) running either 1 or 2 breeding programs, and 3) progeny testing bulls in 1 or 2 environments. Breeding strategies were evaluated on average genetic gain of both environments, which was predicted by using a pseudo-BLUP selection index model. When both environments were equally important and the genetic correlation was higher than 0. 61, the highest average genetic gain was achieved with a single breeding program with <b>progeny-testing</b> all bulls in both environments. When the genetic correlation was lower than 0. 61, it was optimal to have 2 environment-specific breeding programs <b>progeny-testing</b> an equal number of bulls in their own environment only. Breeding strategies differed by 2 to 12 % in average genetic gain, when the genetic correlation ranged between 0. 50 and 1. 00. Ranking of breeding strategies, based on the highest average genetic gain, was relatively insensitive to heritability, number of progeny per bull, and the relative importance of both environments, but was very sensitive to selection intensity. With more intense selection, running 2 environment-specific breeding programs was optimal for genetic correlations up to 0. 70 - 0. 80, but this strategy was less appropriate for situations where 1 of the 2 environments had a relative importance less than 10 to 20 %.

40|$|Holstein bulls were {{assigned}} to sam-pling categories (AI stud, AI nonstud, or non-AI) based on bull code, controller number, and age at semen distribution. The AI stud bulls were sampled through traditional <b>progeny-testing</b> programs of 13 AI organizations; AI nonstud bulls had AI semen collection reported by an-other organization or by multiple organi-zations. The non-AI bulls had no reported AI semen collection. Actual daughter yield deviations for these three groups of bulls were compared with ex-pected performance (parent average) to provide an indication of whether evalua-tions were free from bias for daughter yield deviations. Mean difference of daughter yield deviation from parent average was close to 0 kg for animal model evaluations of all 22, 930 bulls but was positively biased by 46 kg of milk for AI nonstud bulls. Mean ETA and reliabilities for parents were highest for AI stud bulls and lowest for non-AI bulls.

40|$|Strategies of {{selection}} within local populations and of {{importation of semen}} and embryos from countries with higher genetic merit are evaluated for genetic improvement of milk yield in Zimbabwe. Local programs are progeny testing in a closed population, progeny testing com-bined with semen importation to sire 30 % of cows, progeny testing with for-eign sires as sires of bulls, and a closed nucleus selection scheme using embryo transfer started from elite imported stock. Strategies based on continuous importa-tion are imported semen for 30, 50, or 100 % of cows and semen from elite foreign bulls used on local elite cows and bulls from elite imported embryos. Gene flow methods were used to esti-mate the genetic means for the strategies. In predicted genetic response at 25 yr, continuous importation of all semen from the superior exporting country ranks first; second is the importation of elite embryos to provide bulls for AI; and third is the closed nucleus scheme using embryo transfer.

40|$|International audienceBackground Experience from <b>progeny-testing</b> {{indicates}} that the mating of popular bull sires that have high estimated breeding values with excellent dams does not guarantee the production of offspring with superior breeding values. This is explained partly by differences in the standard deviation of gamete breeding values (SDGBV) between animals at the haplotype level. The SDGBV depends on the variance of the true effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) {{and the degree of}} heterozygosity. Haplotypes of 58 035 Holstein animals were used to predict and investigate expected SDGBV for fat yield, protein yield, somatic cell score and the direct genetic effect for stillbirth. ResultsDifferences in SDGBV between animals were detected, which means that the groups of offspring of parents with low SDGBV will be more homogeneous than those of parents with high SDGBV, although the expected mean breeding values of the progeny will be the same. SDGBV was negatively correlated with genomic and pedigree inbreeding coefficients and a small loss of SDGBV over time was observed. Sires that had relatively low mean gamete breeding values but high SDGBV had a higher probability of producing extremely positive offspring than sires that had a high mean gamete breeding value and low SDGBV. ConclusionsAn animal’s SDGBV can be estimated based on genomic information and used to design specific genomic mating plans. Estimated SDGBV are an additional tool for mating programs, which allows breeders to identify and match mating partners using specific haplotype information...|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{analyses}} of sex determination have identified sex chromosomes in many teleost fish species. However, {{there are several}} cases for which sex ratios do not fit perfectly with the expectations of heterogametic systems, suggesting the influence of either minor sex determining genes or environmental influences {{on the process of}} sex differentiation. The frequent absence of sex chromosome markers makes the identification of minor sex-determining genes very difficult. It is easier to test first the hypothesis of environmental sex determination (ESD) by studying the temperature effect, since temperature-dependent sex determination has been demonstrated to occur in several vertebrate groups including 1 fish species. To contribute {{to a better understanding of}} fish sex determination, we have tested the effects of high temperatures on sex ratios of Oreochromis niloticus, and have attempted to isolate sex chromosome molecular markers in Leporinus elongatus. Treatments of O. niloticus fry at 36 degrees C applied for 10 days and more, and starting 1 week after fertilization markedly increased the proportion of males, and <b>progeny-testing</b> these males confirmed that some of them are sex-reversed genetic females. Two non-coding sequences of L. elongatus Z and W chromosomes were cloned by genomic subtraction. They cross-hybridized with the genome of a close species without providing sex-specific patterns. A collection of L. elongates individuals was subjected to gonadal and chromosomal sexing, and DNA hybridization with both sequences. These analyses revealed 3 individuals having atypical W chromosomes. Interestingly, 2 of these were males having a ZW karyotype.

40|$|Dairy cattle {{breeding}} programs {{in developing countries}} are constrained by minimal and erratic pedigree and performance recording on cows on commercial farms. Small-sized nucleus breeding programs offer a viable alternative. Deterministic simulations using selection index theory were performed to determine the optimum design for small-sized nucleus schemes for dairy cattle. The nucleus {{was made up of}} 197 bulls and 243 cows distributed in 8 non-overlapping age classes. Each year 10 sires and 100 dams were selected to produce the next generation of male and female selection candidates. Conception rates and sex ratio were fixed at 0. 90 and 0. 50, respectively, translating to 45 male and 45 female candidates joining the nucleus per year. Commercial recorded dams provided information for genetic evaluation of selection candidates (bulls) in the nucleus. Five strategies were defined: nucleus records only [within-nucleus dam performance (DP) ], progeny records in addition to nucleus records [progeny testing (PT) ], genomic information only [genomic selection (GS) ], dam performance records in addition to genomic information (GS+DP), and progeny records in addition to genomic information (GS+PT). Alternative PT, GS, GS+DP, and GS+PT schemes differed in the number of progeny per sire and size of reference population. The maximum number of progeny records per sire was 30, and the maximum size of the reference population was 5, 000. Results show that GS schemes had higher responses and lower accuracies compared with other strategies, with the higher response being due to shorter generation intervals. Compared with similar sized <b>progeny-testing</b> schemes, genomic-selection schemes would have lower accuracies but these are offset by higher responses per year, which might provide additional incentive for farmers to participate in recording...|$|E

A sample of Korean cattle, Hanwoo (n = 476) was chosen from the National Livestock Research Institute of Korea that were sired by 50 Korean proven bulls. The steers were born between the spring of 1998 and the autumn of 2002 and reared under a <b>progeny-testing</b> program at the Daekwanryeong and Namwon branches of NLRI. The steers were slaughtered at approximately 24 months of age and carcass quality traits were measured. A SNP Harvester method was applied with a support vector machine (SVM) to detect significant SNPs in the CCDC 158 gene and interaction effects between the SNPs that were associated with average daily gains, cold carcass weight, longissimus dorsi muscle area, and marbling scores. The statistical significance of the major SNP combinations was evaluated with x 2 -statistics. The genotype combinations of three SNPs, g. 34425 + 102 A>T(AA), g. 4102636 T>G(GT), and g. 11614 + 19 G>T(GG) had a greater effect than the rest of SNP combinations, e. g. 0. 82 vs. 0. 75 kg, 343 vs. 314 kg, 80. 4 vs 74. 7 cm 2, and 7. 35 vs. 5. 01, for the four respective traits (p< 0. 001). Also, the estimates were greater compared with single SNPs analyzed (the greatest estimates were 0. 76 kg, 320 kg, 75. 5 cm 2, and 5. 31, respectively). This result suggests that the SNP Harvester method is a good option when multiple SNPs and interaction effects are tested.

MethodsIn this study, we explored the potential of increasing the reliability of breeding values of young selection candidates by genotyping a fixed number of first-crop daughters of each sire from one or two generations in a balanced and regular system of genotyping. Using stochastic simulation, we developed a basic population scenario that mimics the situation in dual-purpose Fleckvieh cattle with respect to important key parameters. Starting with a reference set consisting of only genotyped bulls, we extended this reference set by including increasing numbers of daughter genotypes and phenotypes. We studied the effects on model-derived reliabilities, validation reliabilities and unbiasedness of predicted values for selection candidates. We also illustrate and discuss the effects of a selected sample and an unbalanced sampling of daughters. Furthermore, we quantified the role of selection with respect to the influence on validation reliabilities and contrasted these to model-derived reliabilities. ResultsIn the most extended design, with 200 daughters per sire genotyped from two generations, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects were estimated from a reference set of 420, 000 cows and 4200 bulls. For this design, the validation reliabilities for candidates reached 80  % or more, thereby exceeding the reliabilities that were achieved in traditional <b>progeny-testing</b> designs for a trait with moderate to high heritability.

40|$|This {{work was}} part of the EU RobustMilk project. In this work package, we have focused on two aspects of robustness, micro- and macro-environmental {{sensitivity}} and applied these to somatic cell count (SCC), one aspect of milk quality. We showed {{that it is possible to}} combine both categorical and continuous descriptions of the environment in one analysis of genotype by environment interaction. We also developed a method to estimate genetic variation in residual variance and applied it to both simulated and a large field data set of dairy cattle. We showed that it is possible to estimate genetic variation in both micro- and macro-environmental sensitivity in the same data, but that there is a need for good data structure. In a dairy cattle example, this would mean at least 100 bulls with at least 100 daughters each. We also developed methods for improved genetic evaluation of SCC. We estimated genetic variance for some alternative SCC traits, both in an experimental herd data and in field data. Most of them were highly correlated with subclinical mastitis (> 0. 9) and clinical mastitis (0. 7 to 0. 8), and were also highly correlated with each other. We studied whether the fact that animals in different herds are differentially exposed to mastitis pathogens could be a reason for the low heritabilities for mastitis, but did not find strong evidence for that. We also created a new model to estimate breeding values not only for the probability of getting mastitis but also for recovering from it. In a <b>progeny-testing</b> situation, this approach resulted in accuracies of 0. 75 and 0. 4 for these two traits, respectively, which means that it is possible to also select for cows that recover more quickly if they get mastitis...|$|E

The data set used in this study was records of clinical mastitis collected during 2005 / 06 to 2008 / 09 seasons. The data set consisted of 92, 961 lactations from 53, 419 Holstein Friesian, Jersey and HF x JE crossbred cows. The cows were the progeny of 641 sires from 167 dairy herds that participated in a <b>progeny-testing</b> programme for sires. Cows with at least one event of clinical mastitis during the season were coded 1 and cows without mastitis were coded 0. The collective incidence of clinical mastitis was 11 % for 92, 961 lactations. A mixed model was used to estimate heritability, repeatability and breed effects for the incidence of clinical mastitis. The model included the fixed effects of contemporary group (herd and year), calving month, breed, parity, breed composition and heterosis effect of crossbred cows. The random effects included were additive animal and permanent environment of cow. Heritability for the incidence of clinical mastitis was 0. 015 ± 0. 003 and repeatability was 0. 070 ± 0. 005. By breed comparison, Jersey cows had 2. 9 % less incidence of clinical mastitis than Holstein-Friesian cows and the heterosis effects in crossbred cows had 13. 4 % less than the average of the parental breeds. The results from this study suggest that selection for resistance to clinical mastitis will result in a low rate of genetic gain but using Jersey sires of low breeding values can be an alternative to increase genetic resistance to clinical mastitis in New Zealand dairy cattle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A major QTL for fatness and growth, denoted FAT 1, has {{previously}} been detected on pig chromosome 4 q (SSC 4 q) using a Large White – wild boar intercross. Progeny that carried the wild boar allele at this locus had higher fat deposition, shorter length of carcass, and reduced growth. The position and the estimated effects of the FAT 1 QTL for growth and fatness have been confirmed in a previous study. In order to narrow down the QTL interval we have traced the inheritance of the wild boar allele associated with high fat deposition through six additional backcross generations. Results <b>Progeny-testing</b> {{was used to determine}} the QTL genotype for 10 backcross sires being heterozygous for different parts of the broad FAT 1 region. The statistical analysis revealed that five of the sires were segregating at the QTL, two were negative while the data for three sires were inconclusive. We could confirm the QTL effects on fatness/meat content traits but not for the growth traits implying that growth and fatness are controlled by distinct QTLs on chromosome 4. Two of the segregating sires showed highly significant QTL effects that were as large as previously observed in the F 2 generation. The estimates for the remaining three sires, which were all heterozygous for smaller fragments of the actual region, were markedly smaller. With the sample sizes {{used in the present study}} we cannot with great confidence determine whether these smaller effects in some sires are due to chance deviations, epistatic interactions or whether FAT 1 is composed of two or more QTLs, each one with a smaller phenotypic effect. Under the assumption of a single locus, the critical region for FAT 1 has been reduced to a 3. 3 cM interval between the RXRG and SDHC loci. Conclusion We have further characterized the FAT 1 QTL on pig chromosome 4 and refined its map position considerably, from a QTL interval of 70 cM to a maximum region of 20 cM and a probable region as small as 3. 3 cM. The flanking markers for the small region are RXRG and SDHC and the orthologous region of FAT 1 in the human genome is located on HSA 1 q 23. 3 and harbors approximately 20 genes. Our strategy to further refine the map position of this major QTL will be i) to type new markers in our pigs that are recombinant in the QTL interval and ii) to perform Identity-By-Descent (IBD) mapping across breeds that have been strongly selected for lean growth. </p...|$|E
40|$|Genomic {{selection}} has {{the potential}} to revolutionize dairy cattle breeding because young animals can be accurately selected as parents, leading to a much shorter generation interval and higher rates of genetic gain. The aims of this study were to assess the effects of genomic selection and reduction of the generation interval on the rate of genetic gain and rate of inbreeding. Furthermore, the merit of proven bulls relative to young bulls was studied. This is important for breeding organizations as it determines the relative importance of progeny testing. A closed nucleus breeding scheme was simulated in which 1, 000 males and 1, 000 females were born annually, 200 bulls were progeny tested, and 20 sires and 200 dams were selected to produce the next generation. In the "proven" (PROV) scenario, only cows with own performance records and progeny-tested bulls were selected as parents. The proportion of the genetic variance that was explained by simulated marker information (M) was varied from 0 to 100 %. When M increased from 0 to 100 %, the rate of genetic gain increased from 0. 238 to 0. 309 genetic standard deviations (s) per year (+ 30 %), whereas the rate of inbreeding reduced from 1. 00 to 0. 42 % per generation. Alternatively, when young cows and bulls were selected as parents (YNG scenario), the rate of genetic gain for M= 0 % was 0. 292 s/yr but the corresponding rate of inbreeding increased substantially to 3. 15 % per generation. A realistic genomic selection scheme (YNG with M= 40 %) gave 108 % higher rate of genetic gain (0. 495 s/yr) and approximately the same rate of inbreeding per generation as the conventional system without genomic selection (PROV with M= 0 %). The rate of inbreeding per year, however, increased from 0. 18 to 0. 52 % because the generation interval in the YNG scheme was much shorter. <b>Progeny-testing</b> fewer bulls reduced the rate of genetic gain and increased the rate of inbreeding for PROV, but had negligible effects for YNG because almost all sires were young bulls. In scenario YNG with M= 40 %, the best young bulls were superior to the best proven bulls by 1. 27 s difference in genomic estimated breeding value. This superiority increased even further when fewer bulls were progeny tested. This stochastic simulation study shows that genomic selection in combination with a severe reduction in the generation interval can double the rate of genetic gain at the same rate of inbreeding per generation, but with a higher rate of inbreeding per year. The number of progeny-tested bulls can be greatly reduced, although this will slightly affect the quality of the proven bull team. Therefore, it is important for breeding organizations to predict the future demand for proven bull semen in light of the increasing superiority of young bull...|$|E
40|$|In {{chapter one}} of this thesis aspects of {{reproduction}} and production, mainly milk production were reviewed. Components of reproductive efficiency such as the fertility components: age at calving, service periods, days open, calving interval and non return rate; were also investigated. The physiological relationship between those traits and milk production and persistency, in both temperate and tropical environments, was also considered, as well as longevity or stayability as other alternatives for evaluating reproduction. Attention was put on first and second lactation performance. With a view towards understanding physiological aspects of reproduction and production in dairy cows, the nature of lactation in mice was reviewed from the relatively few works that have been done. The papers reviewed included the role of pre-natal and post-natal maternal effects {{and the relationship between}} littersize and milk-yield. Daily yield and lactation from a number of studies were compared. Theories of genotype-environment interaction (GM) and adaptation, as well as their implications, were reviewed in the subsequent part of. chapter 1. Evidence of GEE in dairy cattle (Friesian, Holstein or Friesian-Holstein, crossbred with Friesian, and native) in both reproductive characters and milk production throughout the tropic regions were examined particularly closely. Mating systems and selection responses in genetic improvement programmes also were reviewed. Constraints and shortcomings for the achievement of genetic progress through natural mating, AI and <b>progeny-testing</b> in the tropics were examined in conjunction with attainment of high milk production in the temperate countries. The use of new technology (MOET) for manipulating reproductive efficiency was also introduced in the hope that {{it can be used to}} increase breeding efficiency in the tropics. The milk-yield and reproductive. characters, of two genotypes of mice (one genotype had been selected for high early reproductive and milking performance and the other was a random bred control) were measured in the normal and a hot environment to check if GEI were present. Both genotypes had been developed in the normal temperature. Evidence of interaction was found in the second parity and only in reproductive traits, e. g. fecundity, interval between mating and birth of second parity. These results are supported by many studies of GEI for both milk-yield and reproductive characters in dairy cattle in the tropics. Milk production does not show GEI, if the environment is defined merely as temperature. The previous selection of the improved genotype had resulted in positive correlated responses in: litter size and litter weight at birth in the first parity, production characters (growth characters and preweaning weight of the litters) in both parities, and on milk production but not on persistency. The selected line did maintain its superiority across environments. However females from the improved genotype performed worse in almost all characters in the hot environment compared to the normal environment. In an analogy with dairy cattle, the high production capacity of the selected line was not exhibited in the adverse environment. Problems of genetic improvement in the tropics were discussed. They included the use of appropriate selection criteria based on. more knowledge of both physiological and genetical relationships between milk-yield and other-characters, with the aim of increasing adaptability and productivity in the target environment. Other possibilities for genetic improvement of dairy cattle in the tropics and the use of synthetic breeds for overcoming the problems in the long term were also discussed.

40|$|Pig {{domestication}} started around 10, 000 {{years ago}} during the Neolithic age, independently in Europe and China, and most current pig breeds originate {{from these two}} areas. Among the 560 pig breeds that have been recorded over the world in 2007 by the FAO, only few {{of them have been}} intensively selected for production. Domestication and, more recently, pig breeders have relied on naturally occurring mutations to select individuals exhibiting favourable traits related to reproduction, growth, fatness, resistance to diseases and behaviour. In order to identify these mutations underlying the phenotypic variations of these traits, a number of QTL detection programs was set up, and thousands of QTLs have been detected in the 2000 s. However, for only a few of them, fine-mapping has resulted in the identification of the causal polymorphism. In chapter 1, the general introduction provides an overview of QTL detection in pig in relation to the molecular tools that are available for pig geneticists and to the different mapping strategies that can be used. Major limitations to QTL fine-mapping in pig (but also valid for other livestock species) concern the number of individuals, the number of informative genetic markers and the ability to detect non-additive QTLs. To increase the statistical power by increasing the number of individuals, a combined linkage analysis is presented in chapter 2. To carry out this work, two pig F 2 pedigrees comprising about a thousand individuals each and based on similar breeds (Large White and/or Landrace crossed with Meishan individuals) were combined. Both pedigrees had been developed in the late 1990 s at INRA and WUR. Common QTLs segregating on SSC 2, SSC 4 and SSC 6 were confirmed in the combined analysis, but QTLs that were specific to one pedigree disappeared or were detected at a lower significance threshold. Despite the limited benefits in term of the number of QTLs, {{the increase in the number}} of individuals, enabled us to separate two linked QTLs that were previously detected as a single one. False-positive QTLs were also detected as well as new QTLs characterised by a low frequency and/or a small effect. In addition, both pedigrees could be compared regarding the imprinting status at the IGF 2 -intron 3 -G 3072 A substitution, segregating on SSC 2. The mutation was segregating within the European founders used in both pedigrees, Meishan individuals being all homozygous for the wild allele (G). This analysis, presented in chapter 3, shows that the structure of the pedigree (number of F 1 individuals and size of half-sib families), the number of F 1 heterozygous females at the IGF 2 locus and the segregation of another QTL at a distance of 40 cM from the IGF 2 locus influence the ability to detect imprinting at the IGF 2 mutation. This spurious maternal effect can lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the imprinting status of the IGF 2 mutation, with maternal effects being detected whereas they do not exist. In order to fine-map the second QTL segregating on pig chromosome 2, a backcross design was set up. Sires that were finally progeny tested were all homozygous for a Meishan haplotype in the IGF 2 region, so the phenotypic variation could not be due to the IGF 2 -intron 3 -G 3072 A mutation. Results from the <b>progeny-testing</b> presented in chapter 4 confirmed that a QTL underlying fatness traits was segregating on the short arm of SSC 2. However, the size of the QTL interval could not be reduced because of epistatic interactions. These epistatic effects could be detected because full-sibs with Identical-by-descent haplotypes in the QTL regions were progeny-tested. This particular design could be analysed without the strong assumptions of the line-cross models (according to which QTL alleles are fixed within breeds), so interactions could be detected. The re-analysis of one of the two F 2 pedigrees confirmed that a region on SSC 13 interacts with the QTL segregating in SSC 2, but other candidate regions still need to be considered. The combined analysis of different pedigrees finally gives few benefits regarding the number of new QTLs that were detected. However, these combined analyses enabled to successfully consider non-additive effects such as imprinting and epistasis. During the work described in this thesis, a major technological advance occurred for pig geneticists, with the commercialisation of the Illumina PorcineSNP 60 Beadchip. With this tool, the number of genotypes that can be included in a QTL analysis tremendously increased. In order to properly use this new type of information, the order of the SNPs along the genome must be reliable. In chapter 5, the first high-density genetic map of the pig is presented. This genetic map was computed using information from in silico and RH mapping of the SNPs in combination with recombination rates between them and finally comprised 38, 599 SNPs. Four pig pedigrees based on different breeds were analysed separately, and the analysis of the recombination rate along the pig genome highlighted that the more recombinant regions tend to cluster around the telomeres irrespective of the location of the centromere. Two of the four analysed pedigrees comprised enough male and female meiosis to construct sex-specific maps. Major sex-differences in recombination were observed with a higher recombination rate in the females only within GC-rich regions, with females exhibiting a much stronger correlation between recombination rate and specific sequence features. This new information will be of major importance when dealing with QTL fine-mapping and pig genome evolution. Finally, in the general discussion presented in chapter 6, arguments toward further fine-mapping of QTLs in pig are given despite the increasing interest in genomic selection. Despite major improvements that have been made in the development of high-density SNP chips, efforts are still needed to overcome the biases linked to the design of the chips. In parallel to the development of high-density genotyping tools, few improvements were made regarding phenotyping. In this final chapter, various programs dedicated to the description of highly precise phenotypes and to the development of homogenous phenotyping practices are presented. Such programs, in combination with the development of appropriate genotyping tools, will facilitate the detection of causal variants. These efforts that are still necessary are not only required for pig but also to most livestock species for which QTL fine-mapping is still needed.          ...|$|E
