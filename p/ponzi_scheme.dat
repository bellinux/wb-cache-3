5|$|In January 2011, NuScale's largest investor, Kenwood Group, was {{investigated}} by the Securities Exchange Commission and later plead guilty to operating a <b>Ponzi</b> <b>scheme.</b> The SEC investigation {{was not related to}} any of Kenwood's dealings with NuScale, but Kenwood's assets were frozen just as NuScale was expecting additional funding. The company started making staffing and pay cuts as executives looked for new funding sources and most of the company's employees were laid off within a few months.|$|E
5|$|On 19 September 2007, {{a federal}} {{complaint}} was issued against Hsu by the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. The complaint alleges that Hsu's investment offerings were a <b>Ponzi</b> <b>scheme</b> that paid early investors with {{money that was}} contributed by later investors, that Hsu pressured investors to contribute to candidates for office, providing them {{with a list of}} candidates to choose from and that Hsu reimbursed some contributors to candidates for office in the amount of their contributions. Based on these actions, Hsu is charged with mail fraud, wire fraud and violating the Federal Election Campaign Act. He could face a sentence of up to 45 years in prison.|$|E
5|$|Tower Heist is a 2011 American heist comedy film {{directed}} by Brett Ratner and written by Ted Griffin and Jeff Nathanson, {{based on a}} story by Bill Collage, Adam Cooper and Griffin. The plot follows Josh Kovaks (Ben Stiller), Charlie Gibbs (Casey Affleck) and Enrique Dev'reaux (Michael Peña), employees of an exclusive apartment building who lose their pensions in the <b>Ponzi</b> <b>scheme</b> of Wall Street businessman Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda). The group enlist the aid of criminal Slide (Eddie Murphy), bankrupt businessman Mr. Fitzhugh (Matthew Broderick) and another employee of the apartment building, Odessa (Gabourey Sidibe), to break into Shaw's apartment and steal back their money while avoiding the FBI {{agent in charge of}} his case, Claire Denham (Téa Leoni).|$|E
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis {{has led to}} the unearthing of numerous <b>Ponzi</b> <b>schemes</b> around the world. This paper examines the factors determining individuals' extent of exposure to <b>Ponzi</b> <b>schemes.</b> The theoretical literature on investor gullibility and risk tolerance was used to develop an economic model to explain such exposure. The model was empirically tested by analyzing the results of a survey of 402 investors in Jamaican <b>Ponzi</b> <b>schemes.</b> A profile of persons most likely to be highly exposed to <b>Ponzi</b> <b>schemes</b> was created, along with a delineation of the most critical factors accounting for the popularity of such <b>schemes.</b> <b>Ponzi</b> <b>schemes</b> Pyramid schemes Risk tolerance Gullibility Jamaica...|$|R

5|$|On February 5, 2001, a {{group of}} Wilkinson's {{creditors}} filed suit to have his companies seized. During the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings, Wilkinson admitted that his liabilities exceeded his assets by $300 million. During the proceedings, {{it was revealed that}} Wilkinson had been financially insolvent since 1992 and was operating a <b>Ponzi</b> <b>scheme,</b> paying his creditors with money borrowed from others rather than his own profits. He had paid no federal income taxes since 1991. At his deposition in June 2001, Wilkinson invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination over 140 times. Wallace's Bookstore was liquidated for just over $31 million, and ecampus.com was sold for $2.5 million. Wilkinson's wife, Martha, also filed for bankruptcy; his sons were forced to sell their homes to repay loans made to them by their father. During the bankruptcy proceedings, the Wilkinsons moved from Lexington to Naples, Florida.|$|E
5|$|One morning Josh {{witnesses}} Arthur Shaw, {{a wealthy}} Tower resident, being kidnapped. Josh gives chase, but is tackled by FBI agent Claire Denham, who explains that Shaw {{was attempting to}} flee the country and avoid arrest for embezzling $2 billion in a <b>Ponzi</b> <b>scheme.</b> Josh confesses to the Tower staff that he gave their pensions to Shaw to invest, and they have lost everything; Lester attempts suicide by stepping {{in front of a}} train, but survives. After visiting Lester in the hospital, Josh, Charlie, and Enrique confront Shaw, under house arrest in his penthouse apartment. Shaw expresses condolences, but is not sincere enough when he forgets to ask if Lester is all right, and out of anger, Josh smashes the windows of the 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso displayed in Shaw's apartment. Josh's boss, Mr. Simon, fires him for his actions, as well as Charlie and Enrique.|$|E
5|$|Wilkinson {{was able}} to secure passage of a {{constitutional}} amendment allowing a state lottery. He also helped craft a significant education reform bill {{in response to a}} ruling by the Kentucky Supreme Court that declared the state's entire public school system unconstitutional. Wilkinson's term was plagued by political scandal and an uneasy relationship with the state legislature. He advocated an amendment to the state constitution that would allow him to seek a second consecutive term as governor, but the amendment was defeated in the General Assembly. His wife Martha attempted to succeed him, but withdrew from the campaign amid weak support for her candidacy. Following his term as governor, Wilkinson encountered difficult financial times. In 2001, he was sued by a group of creditors, and during the proceedings, it was revealed that he was operating a <b>Ponzi</b> <b>scheme</b> to keep his businesses afloat. Both he and his wife Martha filed for bankruptcy later that year. In 2002, Wilkinson was hospitalized with arterial blockages. His condition was complicated by a recurrence of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He suffered a stroke on July 4, 2002, and his family withdrew his life support the following day in accordance with his previously-expressed wishes.|$|E
2500|$|While often {{confused}} {{for each}} other, pyramid <b>schemes</b> and <b>Ponzi</b> <b>schemes</b> {{are different from}} each other. They are related {{in the sense that}} both pyramid and <b>Ponzi</b> <b>schemes</b> are forms of financial fraud. However, pyramid schemes are based on network marketing, where each part of the pyramid takes a piece of the pie / benefits, forwarding the money {{to the top of the}} pyramid. They fail simply because there aren't sufficient people. <b>Ponzi</b> <b>schemes,</b> on the other hand, are based on the principle of [...] "Robbing Peter to pay Paul"—early investors are paid their returns through the proceeds of investments by later investors. In other words, one central person (or entity) in the middle taking money from one person, keeping part of it and giving the rest to others who had invested in the scheme earlier. Thus, schemes such as the Anubhav teak plantation scheme (teak plantation scam of 1998) in India can be called <b>Ponzi</b> <b>schemes.</b> Some <b>Ponzi</b> <b>schemes</b> can depend on multi-level marketing for popularizing them, thus forming a combination of the two.|$|R
40|$|<b>Ponzi</b> <b>schemes</b> are {{financial}} frauds where, {{under the}} promise of high profits, users put their money, recovering their investment and interests only if enough users after them continue to invest money. Originated in the offline world 150 years ago, <b>Ponzi</b> <b>schemes</b> have since then migrated to the digital world, approaching first on the Web, and more recently hanging over cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum have provided a new opportunity for scammers, who have now the possibility of creating "trustworthy" frauds that still make users lose money, but at least are guaranteed to execute "correctly". We present a comprehensive survey of <b>Ponzi</b> <b>schemes</b> on Ethereum, analysing their behaviour and their impact from various viewpoints. Perhaps surprisingly, we identify a remarkably high number of <b>Ponzi</b> <b>schemes,</b> despite the hosting platform has been operating for less than two years...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{regulation}} on repo, leverage, <b>Ponzi</b> <b>schemes</b> and bubbles. Repo <b>Ponzi</b> <b>schemes</b> can be done by creditors who collect haircut and then reuse the collateral that was pledged to them. In bilateral repo, only dealers have such haircut benefit and regulation consists in limiting dealers' positions. In exchanges, the segregation of the haircut avoids <b>Ponzi</b> <b>schemes.</b> However, as we illustrate, both cases allow for bubbles when agents are not uniformly impatient. We also show that all agents may be worse o if repo markets were absent and that bubbles are robust to the endogenous issuance of the securities...|$|R
5|$|Hsu {{was able}} to gain the trust of investors by his dress, by his warm and personable manner, by his {{educational}} credentials, by being quoted in trade magazines, and by {{the long list of}} business under his name, but had a record of changing addresses and leaving disappointed investors behind. Starting in 1989, Hsu raised $1 million from investors to launch a latex glove business. Some of these partners invested their life savings or mortgaged their homes, and some sued Hsu when it appeared their money was lost. In 1990, Hsu, then living in Foster City, California, declared a bankruptcy, stating that he was practically destitute, with no job, no income, and few possessions other than an SUV and a ring. That same year, he was also divorced as well as allegedly kidnapped by San Francisco Triad society gang leader Raymond Kwok Chow. In 1991, California authorities brought fraud charges against him, describing his operation as a <b>Ponzi</b> <b>scheme.</b> Specifically, authorities claimed Hsu had not engaged in any legitimate business activity, but instead was using funds from later investors to pay returns to earlier ones. In February 1992 Hsu plead no contest to one count of grand theft and agreed to serve up to three years in prison and pay a $10,000 fine. Hsu subsequently failed to appear at the sentencing hearing and a warrant was issued for his arrest.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Ponzi</b> <b>scheme</b> is an {{investment}} fund where withdrawals are financed by subsequent investors, rather than profit obtained through investment activities.

25|$|The {{earliest}} public {{warnings about}} the reckless and fradulent CIS in West Bengal started in 2009 from MPs Somendra Nath Mitra and Abu Hasem Khan Choudhury and TMC leader Sadhan Pande.

By that time, the Saradha Group <b>Ponzi</b> <b>scheme</b> was already beginning to unravel. In January 2013, the group's cash inflow was, for the first time, less than its cash payouts.

Confirming the intuition of the standard economic model of crime, this effect is only present in places with relatively weak judicial and law enforcement institutions, and with little access to consumption smoothing mechanisms such as microcredit. In addition, we show that, with the exception of economically-motivated felonies such as robbery, violent crime is not affected by the negative shock...|$|R
