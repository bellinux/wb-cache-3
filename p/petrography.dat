25|$|The {{results of}} the INAA study were later defended in March 2006 in two {{articles}} in Latin American Antiquity, in particular contrasting the sample size of the INAA study (roughly 1000) with the sample size of the <b>petrography</b> analysis (20).|$|E
25|$|The diaphaneity of {{a mineral}} depends on {{thickness}} of the sample. When a mineral is sufficiently thin (e.g., in a thin section for <b>petrography),</b> it may become transparent even if that property is not seen in hand sample. In contrast, some minerals, such as hematite or pyrite are opaque even in thin-section.|$|E
25|$|Radioactivity {{is a rare}} property; {{minerals}} may {{be composed}} of radioactive elements. They could be a defining constituent, such as uranium in uraninite, autunite, and carnotite, or as trace impurities. In the latter case, the decay of a radioactive element damages the mineral crystal; the result, termed a radioactive halo or pleochroic halo, is observable by various techniques, such as thin-section <b>petrography.</b>|$|E
25|$|The name dravite {{was used}} for the first time by Gustav Tschermak (1836–1927), Professor of Mineralogy and <b>Petrography</b> at the University of Vienna, in his book Lehrbuch der Mineralogie (published in 1884) for magnesium-rich (and sodium-rich) {{tourmaline}} from village Dobrova near Unterdrauburg in the Drava river area, Carinthia, Austro-Hungarian Empire. Today this tourmaline locality (type locality for dravite) at Dobrova (near Dravograd), {{is a part of the}} Republic of Slovenia. Tschermak gave this tourmaline the name dravite, for the Drava river area, which is the district along the Drava River (in German: Drau, in Latin: Drave) in Austria and Slovenia. The chemical composition which was given by Tschermak in 1884 for this dravite approximately corresponds to the formula NaMg3(Al,Mg)6B3Si6O27(OH), which is in good agreement (except for the OH content) with the endmember formula of dravite as known today.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2005 {{the results}} of another study were published. This study used <b>petrography</b> to analyze 20 pottery shards, and found that five of the samples from San Lorenzo were [...] "unambiguously" [...] from Oaxaca. Based on this evidence, the authors {{concluded}} that the [...] "exchanges of vessels between highland and lowland chiefly centers were reciprocal, or two way" [...] which [...] "contradicts recent claims that the Gulf Coast was the sole source of pottery" [...] in Mesoamerica.|$|E
6000|$|She dressed {{carefully}} for {{dinner in a}} black dress that her father liked, and that made her look serious and responsible. Dinner was quite uneventful. Her father read a draft prospectus warily, and her aunt dropped fragments of her projects for managing while the cook had a holiday. After dinner Ann Veronica went into the drawing-room with Miss Stanley, and her father went up to his den for his pipe and pensive <b>petrography.</b> Later in the evening she heard him whistling, poor man! ...|$|E
6000|$|Ann Veronica's {{father was}} a {{solicitor}} with {{a good deal of}} company business: a lean, trustworthy, worried-looking, neuralgic, clean-shaven man of fifty-three, with a hard mouth, a sharp nose, iron-gray hair, gray eyes, gold-framed glasses, and a small, circular baldness at the crown of his head. His name was Peter. He had had five children at irregular intervals, of whom Ann Veronica was the youngest, so that as a parent he came to her perhaps a little practised and jaded and inattentive; and he called her his [...] "little Vee," [...] and patted her unexpectedly and disconcertingly, and treated her promiscuously as of any age between eleven and eight-and-twenty. The City worried him a good deal, and what energy he had left over he spent partly in golf, a game he treated very seriously, and partly in the practices of microscopic <b>petrography.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He was not due {{from the}} City until about six, {{and so she}} went and played Badminton with the Widgett girls until dinner-time. The {{atmosphere}} at dinner was not propitious. Her aunt was blandly amiable above a certain tremulous undertow, and talked as if to a caller about the alarming spread of marigolds that summer {{at the end of}} the garden, a sort of Yellow Peril to all the smaller hardy annuals, while her father brought some papers to table and presented himself as preoccupied with them. [...] "It really seems as if we shall have to put down marigolds altogether next year," [...] Aunt Molly repeated three times, [...] "and do away with marguerites. They seed beyond all reason." [...] Elizabeth, the parlormaid, kept coming in to hand vegetables whenever there seemed a chance of Ann Veronica asking for an interview. Directly dinner was over Mr. Stanley, having pretended to linger to smoke, fled suddenly up-stairs to <b>petrography,</b> and when Veronica tapped he answered through the locked door, [...] "Go away, Vee! I'm busy," [...] and made a lapidary's wheel buzz loudly.|$|E
6000|$|It came to Ann Veronica {{that life}} was {{wonderful}} beyond measure. It seemed incredible {{that she and her}} aunt were, indeed, creatures of the same blood, only by a birth or so different beings, and part of that same broad interlacing stream of human life that has invented the fauns and nymphs, Astarte, Aphrodite, Freya, and all the twining beauty of the gods. The love-songs of all the ages were singing in her blood, the scent of night stock from the garden filled the air, and the moths that beat upon the closed frames of the window next the lamp set her mind dreaming of kisses in the dusk. Yet her aunt, with a ringed hand flitting to her lips and a puzzled, worried look in her eyes, deaf to all this riot of warmth and flitting desire, was playing Patience--playing Patience, as if Dionysius and her curate had died together. A faint buzz above the ceiling witnessed that <b>petrography,</b> too, was active. Gray and tranquil world! Amazing, passionless world! A world in which days without meaning, days in which [...] "we don't want things to happen" [...] followed days without meaning--until the last thing happened, the ultimate, unavoidable, coarse, [...] "disagreeable." [...] It was her last evening in that wrappered life against which she had rebelled. Warm reality was now so near her she could hear it beating in her ears. Away in London even now Capes was packing and preparing; Capes, the magic man whose touch turned one to trembling fire. What was he doing? What was he thinking? It was less than a day now, less than twenty hours. Seventeen hours, sixteen hours. She glanced at the soft-ticking clock with the exposed brass pendulum upon the white marble mantel, and made a rapid calculation. To be exact, it was just sixteen hours and twenty minutes. The slow stars circled on to the moment of their meeting. The softly glittering summer stars! She saw them shining over mountains of snow, over valleys of haze and warm darkness.... There would be no moon.|$|E

50|$|During the 1840s, a {{development}} by Henry C. Sorby and others firmly {{laid the foundation}} of <b>petrography.</b> This was a technique to study very thin slices of rock. A slice of rock was affixed to a microscope slide and then ground so thin that light could be transmitted through mineral grains that otherwise appeared opaque. The position of adjoining grains was not disturbed, thus permitting analysis of rock texture. Thin section <b>petrography</b> became the standard method of rock study. Since textural details contribute greatly to knowledge of the sequence of crystallization of the various mineral constituents in a rock, <b>petrography</b> progressed into petrogenesis and ultimately into petrology.|$|E
