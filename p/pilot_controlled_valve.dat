50|$|The huffer {{works by}} blowing {{compressed}} air via flexible hose to the aircraft's bleed air system. From there, the air flows via a <b>pilot</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>valve</b> to the engine's starter motor. The starter motor converts {{the energy of the}} moving air to rotational torque. The starter motor is linked via shaft to the N2 or core of the engine and spins the compressor and first stage turbine. Once there is enough air flowing through the compressor and the combustion chamber to light the engine, fuel in the form of vaporized kerosene starts flowing and an igniter similar to a spark plug ignites the fuel. Then fuel flow is increased to spin the engine up to its normal idle speed, at which point the engine is self-sustaining and no longer needs the support of the starter.|$|E

The damper structure is designed, so that rebound and compression damping forces can be tuned independently, of which the variable valve is placed externally. The rate of pressure change with respect to the flow rate after blow-off becomes smooth when the fixed orifice size increases, which means that the blow-off slope is controllable using the fixed orifice size. Damping forces are measured with the change of the solenoid current at the different piston velocities to confirm the maximum hysteresis of 20 N, linearity, and variance of damping force.

40|$|Uncertainties in the {{mechanical}} system severely increase {{the complexity of}} the system. Present the uncertainties can be parameterized by listing the coefficient from the transfer function. The attempt to reduce the uncertainties by capturing the type of data, then reproducing the data with a simple form easy for doing further analysis is the kernel technique in building uncertainty model to transform uncertainties into an easier form. However, since the traditional optimization algorithms proposed by previous researchers may trapped in solving non-convex polynomial function optimization problem, yet genetic algorithm is better to avoid non-convex problem, any discoveries on developing the effective GA (genetic algorithm) with better convergence haves been presented. Because GA contains unpredictable variations, a fine tuning on the algorithm specifically for one type of problem is needed. Focusing on increasing the speed and performance of the algorithm, a series of normalization method is adopted based on the assumption of linear transformation; as well as preventing converging to a false solution (such as the twisted result), series of coefficients are defined. The GA optimization is working by selecting by roulette wheel method with probability weights for the population.

40|$|Surge is an {{aerodynamic}} flow instability {{which can}} lead to the catastrophic failure of the compressor sys-tem. One way to cope with this compressor flow instability is active control. For a laboratory-scale gas turbine installation, an active surge control system is proposed which consists of a plenum pressure sensor and a bleedhecycle valve. This work focuses on the selection of a <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> More specifically, the required bandwidth and capacity of the valve are specified. To study the influence of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on system behavior, simulations are done with the Greitzer model which describes the behavior of the nonlinear compression system during surge. This model is extended with a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> model which accounts for the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics and the effect of valve saturation. A linear static output feedback controller is used to stabilize the compression system around its nominal operating point. The main contributions of this study are the following. First, a systematic approach is presented to deter-mine the required bandwidth and capacity of a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for active surge control. Second, an efficient control strategy is applied: one-sided control. In this control strategy, the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is nominally closed and only opens to stabilize the system in its nominal operating point. Third, a stability analysis of the constrained linearized compression system is presented. Using the bounded static output feedback controller, surge limit cycles are stabilized in the nominal operat-ing point. Stable operation can be sustained in this point with zero <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> mass flow if disturbances are absent. From simulations, the minimal bandwidth and capacity of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> needed for stabi-lization are determined.

"May 2012 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] In this work a method is developed for modeling frequency domain error in dynamic systems with parametric uncertainty. Within any mass-manufactured dynamic system, parameters such as masses, springs or geometrical attributes can vary from one system to the next. Overall performance or stability of the system can therefore be a function of the extent of uncertainty within the physical parameters. In typical robust control designs, uncertainty models work to account for all possible error within the system. The error modeling approach presented here is unique in that only a fraction of possible error is represented by the model. Validation of the uncertainty modeling technique was completed on a <b>pilot</b> operated proportional <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> Thirty replications of the pilot stage of the proportional <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> were obtained and tested with one main stage. An uncertainty model which takes into account only a fraction of error is formed based on simulated frequency response data from an analytical model. A comparison is presented of two different control designs, a mixed sensitivity H-infinity and a proportional controller. The controllers are implemented in a closed-loop experimental setup in which all 30 pilot valves were retested. This study is shown to verify the ability of the robustness analysis utilizing the uncertainty model to approximate the probability of a system obtaining performance or stability specifications given parametric uncertainty within the system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Stiction in <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> is an {{extremely}} nonlinear {{and one of the}} long-standing problems in a closed loop control system, since the controller will push the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> to move until the controlled variable reaches the desired value. Stiction moves the <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> to extreme positions so that the process output will force to produce overshoot. Then, the action gets repeated as the controller output reverses its direction. The limit cycle generated, when the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> sticks and slips during a change in input signal is called stick/slip cycle, will induce vibrations. As the control loops in an industrial plant are interlinked each other; these oscillations will be propagated to the entire system. In this critical situation the only option is to go for maintenance of the faulty valves, which may be recommended / possible only during process shut down. But, shutting down the process for maintenance of defective valves is not an economical option. Hence, {{it is very important to}} provide an efficient technique to compensate the nonlinear effect of the stiction in faulty <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> especially when it is not under maintenance.
