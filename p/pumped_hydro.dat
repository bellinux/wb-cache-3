25|$|Underground {{hydrogen}} {{storage is}} {{the practice of}} hydrogen storage in underground caverns, salt domes and depleted oil and gas fields. Large quantities of gaseous hydrogen have been stored in underground caverns by ICI for many years without any difficulties. The storage of large quantities of liquid hydrogen underground can function as grid energy storage. The round-trip efficiency is approximately 40% (vs. 75-80% for pumped-hydro (PHES)), and the cost is slightly higher than <b>pumped</b> <b>hydro.</b> The European project Hyunder indicated in 2013 that for the storage of wind and solar energy an additional 85 caverns are required as it can't be covered by PHES and CAES systems.|$|E
25|$|With European {{countries}} such as Germany and Denmark moving to very high levels (80% and 100% respectively by 2050) of renewable energy for all energy uses there will be increasing periods of excess production of renewable electrical energy. Storage of this energy as potential electrical energy (e.g. <b>pumped</b> <b>hydro)</b> is very costly and reduces total round-trip efficiency. However, storing it as heat in district heating systems, for use in buildings where there is demand, is significantly less costly. Whilst {{the quality of the}} electrical energy is degraded, high voltage grid MW sized heat pumps would maximise efficiency whilst not wasting excess renewable electricity. Stockholm at present has about 660 MW of heat pumps connected to its district heating system.|$|E

50|$|A 2016 study {{looked at}} the {{relationship}} between storage and transmission capacity under high shares of renewable energy sources (RES) in an EUMENA power system.

For a transition to a fully renewable energy system by 2050, major structural changes are required. The results indicate the optimal allocation of photovoltaics and wind power, the resulting demand for storage capacities of different technologies (battery, <b>pumped</b> <b>hydro,</b> and hydrogen storage) and the capacity of the transmission grid.|$|E

They propose that this can be economically achieved by deploying 100% renewable energy - including off-river <b>pumped</b> <b>hydro,</b> solar pv, wind and concentrated solar power plants - buildings energy upgrades and electrification of transport and heating along with the implementation of sequestration, ceasing deforestation for grazing and improved animal agriculture herd and crop management.|$|E
50|$|In 2013 the round-trip {{efficiency}} of power-to-gas-storage was well below 50%, with the hydrogen path {{being able to}} reach a maximum {{efficiency of}} ~ 43% and methane of ~ 39% by using combined-cycle powerplants.
