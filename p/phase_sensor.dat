40|$|Abstract. The {{adaptive}} optics capabilities are strongly {{limited by the}} quality of the phasing of the primary mirror of the extremely large telescope. Up to date, the Keck telescopes are the only segmented telescope phased with a quality enabling the application of {{adaptive optics}}. The Active Phasing Experiment has been installed at the Namyth focus of the Very Large Telescope Melipal during the last 6 months. Its purpose is to understand and compare different technological concepts for an optical <b>phasing</b> <b>sensor</b> dedicated to the European Extremely Large Telescope. The pupil of the telescope is segmented in 61 hexagonal segments by projecting it on an Active Segmented Mirror. The ASM is controlled by a dual wavenlength interferometer made by Fogale Nanotech with a nanometric precision. The segmented pupil is distributed in parallel to four optical <b>phasing</b> <b>sensors.</b> They are a pyramid sensor, a curvature <b>sensor,</b> a <b>phase</b> filtering <b>sensor</b> and a Shack-Hartmann sensor. They have been developed respectively by Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica in Florenze, Instituto Astrofisica Canarias in Tenerife, Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Marseille and ESO. The global behaviour of the optical <b>phasing</b> <b>sensors</b> will be described and preliminary results of the Active Phasing Experiments obtained on sky will be explained. The extrapolation of the results to the EELT and the potential consequences for the adaptive optics will be given. The Active Phasing Experiment has been financed by th...|$|R
40|$|The future European Extremely Large Telescope will be {{composed}} {{of one or two}} giant segmented mirrors (up to 100 m of diameter) and of several large monolithic mirrors (up to 8 m in diameter). To limit the aberrations due to misalignments and defective surface quality it is necessary to have a proper active optics system. This active optics system must include a phasing system to limit the degradation of the PSF due to misphasing of the segmented mirrors. We will present the lastest design and development of the Active Phasing Experiment that will be tested in laboratory and on-sky connected to a VLT at Paranal in Chile. It includes an active segmented mirror, a static piston plate to simulate a secondary segmented mirror and of four <b>phasing</b> wavefront <b>sensors</b> to measure the piston, tip and tilt of the segments and the aberrations of the VLT. The four <b>phasing</b> <b>sensors</b> are the Diffraction Image Phase Sensing Instrument developed by Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias, the Pyramid <b>Phasing</b> <b>Sensor</b> developed by Arcetri Astrophysical Observatory, the Shack-Hartmann <b>Phasing</b> <b>Sensor</b> developed by the European Southern Observatory and the Zernike Unit for Segment phasing developed by Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille.

40|$|All the ELT {{projects}} {{present a}} segmented primary mirror. The {{quality of the}} PSF produced by these instruments is strongly dependent from the segment phasing accuracy [1]. In order to obtain a diffraction limit lower than the single segment one, the segments need an active alignment system. To obtain a resolution commensurable with a monolithic telescope of the same diameter, the system must be driven by an optical <b>phasing</b> <b>sensor.</b> In this work we will present the first laboratory experiment that shows the performances of the pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS) operating in closed loop as <b>phasing</b> <b>sensor.</b> The PWFS has been introduced by R. Ragazzoni in 1996 [2] as a wavefront sensor for adaptive optics systems. In 2001 Esposito [3] proposed the PWFS as <b>phasing</b> <b>sensor</b> for segmented mirrors, demonstrating, with numerical simulations, that the sensor can sense and control {{at the same time}} differential piston, tip and tilt of each segment. The first characterization of the signal produced in the PWFS by a phase discontinuity was reported in [4]. This and further analysis show the existence of this signal and its sinusoidal dependence from the step phase. The comparison between the phase measurement of the PWFS and the external metrology demonstrates an accuracy lower than 3 nm, operating in double pass with a wavelength of 633 nm. The next experimental step is aimed to demonstrate that this sensor can control the phasing of several segments operating in closed loop.

40|$|A large multi-aperture {{telescope}} has {{the potential}} to reach the diffraction limit corresponding to its baseline. To do so, Adaptive Optics (AO) and beam combination are critical to good performance. Operation as an interferometer is a complicated mode for the telescope. The system now has much tighter tolerances and is difficult to align. The alignment process needs to be planned in multiple steps, and tolerance and sensitivity analysis needs to be performed for each step. Alignment tools can be prepared based on the resolution found in the sensitivity analysis in each step. Random fluctuation is another critical factor that reduces system performance. If noise sources near the telescope are characterized and identified, image quality can be improved by post-image processing. Measuring the outer scale of atmosphere is also helpful for understanding the system performance. The fringe tracking method in the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) system provides optical path difference (OPD) variation, and the power spectral density of the OPD variation is used to estimate the size of the outer scale. However, this method is limited by the baseline of the LBTI by 5 √ 3 B, where B is the baseline, and by this equation the outer scale size which is able to be estimated should be more than 125 m. AO simulation can provide an understanding of new AO system concepts and parameter variations before they are applied to the real system. In this dissertation study, we simulated an LBTI system with structural vibration of 10 Hz and 20 Hz and with various amplitudes. From the simulation, we learned that the slower bandwidth of piston-correcting systems allows stars as faint as ~ 13 the magnitude to be observed. If there is significant vibration on the structure, the increased bandwidth will limit the phasing stars to 10 ~ 11 th magnitudes. This demonstrates the limits of the LBTI system regarding structural vibration. An alternative <b>phasing</b> <b>sensor</b> for the LBTI system, the pseudo <b>phasing</b> <b>sensor,</b> can be used for more than 1000 m of outer scale of atmosphere. If the direct <b>phasing</b> <b>sensor</b> embedded in the LBTI system cannot be used for a very faint star, the pseudo <b>phasing</b> <b>sensor,</b> which approximately estimates the phase difference by AO wavefront sensor, can be useful for atmospheric conditions with estimated outer scale of about 1000 m.

The results also support the presence of a driving vortex proposed in the literature. A plethora of experimental techniques progressively reveal the characteristics and features of the external precessing jet. The characteristics of the jet at the exit plane are found to be sensitive to inlet conditions and to inlet Reynolds number. The structure of the flow emerging from the FPJ exit is revealed, and found to contain several significant vortical features. Based on the evidence gathered from all the experiments, a new flow structure of the external precessing jet is proposed. Finally, the new experimental data are used to define Strouhal and Reynolds numbers based on the actual characteristics of the emerging jet.

40|$|In the {{technological}} {{development for the}} ELTs, {{one of the key}} activities is the phasing and alignment of the primary mirror segments. To achieve the phasing accuracy of {{a small fraction of the}} wavelength, an optical sensor is required. In 2005 has been demonstrated that the Pyramid Wavefront Sensor can be employed in closed loop to correct simultaneously piston, tip and tilt errors of segmented mirror. The Pyramid <b>Phasing</b> <b>Sensor</b> (PYPS) is based on the sensing of phase step on the segment edges; this kind of <b>phasing</b> <b>sensors</b> have the common limitation of the signal ambiguity induced by the phase periodicity of piδ/λ on the mirror surface step δ, when the wavelength λ is used for the sensing. In this paper we briefly describe three different techniques that allow to solve the phase ambiguity with PYPS.

40|$|A <b>phase</b> <b>sensor</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} for use in aligning a segmented telescope mirror to within {{a fraction of a}} wavelength in piston. (As used here, piston signifies displacement of a mirror segment along the optical axis of the telescope.) Such precise alignment is necessary in order to realize the full benefit of the large aperture achievable through segmentation. This <b>phase</b> <b>sensor</b> is achromatic. It is based on two-wavelength shearing interferometry, and can be modified to utilize an extended or broad-band (e. g., white) light source. The sensor optics include a ruled diffraction grating and an imaging lens. The sensor can measure the piston shift between segments as well as aberrations of the segments. It can measure the surface error of an individual segment, making it possible to compensate for the error with optimal amount(s) of piston and/or tilt. The precise capture range of the sensor depends partly on the telescope design; the largest relative piston shifts measurable by use of this sensor are of the order of 100 m. The accuracy of the sensor also depends partly on the telescope design; in general, the accuracy is sufficient to enable alignment to within approximately half a wavelength. The interferometric image is digitized and processed by a simple algorithm in real time, and the output of the algorithm can be used to maintain alignment in real time, even in the presence of atmospheric turbulence. The sensor is robust. Through calibration, it can be made insensitive to (and, hence, tolerant of) misalignments and aberrations of its own optics, most aberrations of the telescope as a whole (in contradistinction to aberrations of individual segments), and most aberrations introduced by atmospheric turbulenc...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve the high {{performance}} required for the astronomical science programs with coming Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), the errors due to segment misalignment must be reduced to tens of nm. Therefore {{the development of new}} co-phasing techniques is of critical importance for ground-based telescopes, and to a large extent for future space-based missions. We propose a new co-phasing method directly exploiting the scientific image delivered by the Self-Coherent Camera (SCC) by adequately combining segment misalignment estimators (piston and tip/tilt) and image processing. The Self-Coherent Camera <b>Phasing</b> <b>Sensor</b> (SCC-PS) is shown to be capable of estimating accurately and simultaneously piston and tip/tilt misalignments and to correct them in close-loop operation in a few iterations. By contrast to several <b>phasing</b> <b>sensor</b> concepts the SCC-PS does not require any a priori on the signal at the segment boundaries, or a dedicated optical path. The SCC-PS is a non-invasive concept that works directly on the scientific image of the instrument, either in a coronagrahic or a non-coronagraphic observing mode. The primary results obtained in this study are very promising and demonstrate that the SCC-PS is a serious candidate for segment co-phasing at the instrument level or at the telescope level for both ground- and space-based applications. Applications of the estimators and algorithm developed for the SCC-PS seem to be possible to other on-segment aberration measurement.
