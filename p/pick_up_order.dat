The group considered {{walking away from the}} <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>order</b> over the new content restrictions. Then former head of Fuse programming, Jennifer Caserta, left to become the General Manager of the IFC network and brought the Whitest Kids along with her to IFC. At the time, Fuse and IFC were both part of Rainbow Media. The Rainbow Media executives felt that the Whitest Kids program was more appropriate for IFC than Fuse, so they approved the switch.|$|E
40|$|International audiencePerceptual {{neuroscience}} {{has identified}} mechanisms of perceptual grouping {{which account for}} the 4 ways in which visual sensitivity to ordered structure and regularities expresses itself, in behavior and 5 in the brain. The need to actively construct order, notably representations of objects in depth, is 6 mandated as soon as visual signals reach the retina, given the occlusion of retinal signals by retinal 7 veins and other retinal elements or blur. Multiple stages of neural processing transform fragmented 8 signals into visual key representations of 3 D scenes {{that can be used}} to control effective behaviors. 9 Since our survival depends on our abilities to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>order</b> in the physical world, and since we 10 conceive the physical world as an ordered one, our perception of it must somehow be sensitive to 11 order. The articles from this collection illustrate how texture dissimilarity, boundary completion, 12 surface filling-in, and figure-ground segregation generate perceptual order. Structural regularities are 13 required for a visual texture to be discriminated from random noise by human observers, as shown in 14 [URL], where Katkov, Harris and Sagi compare the performance 15 of human observers to those of an Ideal Observer and an Order Observer model. The Order Observer 16 model, based on the capture of statistical regularities in textures, is shown to closely reflect the 17 sensitivity of the human visual system. Spatiotemporal boundary formation is critical to the 18 perception of shape boundaries and global motion [URL] as 19 shown here by Erlikhman and Kellman, who demonstrate boundary integration from spatially and 20 temporally sparse transformations of texture. The visual system uses positions and times of element 21 transformations to extract local structural regularities such as edge fragments, which then connect by 22 interpolation processes to produce larger shapes with a spatiotemporal integration constraint of ~ 80 23 ms between elements. Structural ambiguity and uncertainty pose a specific problem here. Perceptual 24 grouping not only accounts for the ways in which physically defined order is processed by the visual 25 system, but also how such order may be inferred in cases of uncertainty, and how this may give rise 26 to the perception of "illusory" or " phantom " shapes. Roncato, Guidi, Parlangeli and Battaglini 27 discuss a new phenomenon [URL] in which illusory streaks 28 irradiate from the vertexes of angular contours, connecting pairs of figures and forming phantom net 29 shapes that are only clearly visible in a specific figural context, as discussed here in the light of 30 several theories of object contour detection. The real world conditions or configurative order to 31 which perceptual grouping is sensitive also determine our aesthetic perception, as shown already 32 elsewhere in a large body of previous work on aesthetic preferences for structural regularities. Here, 33 Pinna, Porcheddu and Deiana [URL] discuss a novel variant of 34 perceptual grouping called accentuation for perceptual coupling. New conditions for grouping that 35 cannot be explained in terms of the classical Gestalt principles (similarity etc) are shown. This new 36 work reveals the supremacy of dissimilarity as an important figural complement to similarity in the 37 genesis of aesthetic structure, involving novel dynamics of perceptual grouping they call coupling. 38 The visual system organizes incoming information early on and interprets a 2 D image in terms of the 39 real world, producing configurative order that provides perceptual continuity and enables object- 40 based attention. In [URL] Grossberg reviews the Form-And- 41 Color-And-DEpth (FACADE) model and its laminar cortical embodiment and extension by the 3 D 42 LAMINART models. These have explained, simulated, and predicted many perceptual and 43 neurobiological data about how the visual cortex carries out 3 D vision and figure-ground perception, 44 and how these cortical mechanisms generate 3 D percepts from 2 D pictures of occluding and 45 occluded objects. The models provide a unified explanation of neurophysiological data about cortical 46 area V 2 cells reported in a remarkable series of articles from the von der Heydt laboratory...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we analyze the {{convergence}} {{properties of the}} Spectral Deferred Correction (SDC) method originally proposed by Dutt et al. [BIT, 40 (2000), pp. 241 [...] 266]. The framework for this high-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver is typically described wherein a low order approximation (such as forward or backward Euler) is lifted to higher order accuracy by applying the low order method to an error equation and then adding in the resulting defect to the current solution. Our focus is not on solving the error equation to increase the order of accuracy, but on rewriting the solver as an iterative Picard integral equation solver. In doing so, our chief finding {{is that it is}} not the low <b>order</b> solver that <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> the <b>order</b> of accuracy with each correction, nor is it the expression of the error equation, but it is the underlying quadrature rule of the right hand side function that is solely responsible for <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> additional <b>orders</b> of accuracy. Our proofs point to a total of three sources of errors that SDC methods carry: the error at the current time point, the error from the previous iterate, and the numerical integration error that comes from the total number of quadrature nodes used for integration. We indicate that the difference between the current and previous iterate always gets multiplied by a multiple of the time step size, and therefore it has no bearing on whether or not the solver <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> an <b>order</b> of accuracy. From this vantage, we solidify the prospects of extending spectral deferred correction methods to a larger class of solvers to which we present some examples...|$|R
