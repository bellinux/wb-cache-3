50|$|Photron is a {{business}} unit of IMAGICA Robot Holdings, Inc., The Imagica Robot Group started about 70 years ago at Kyoto Uzumasa, Japan, {{the center of the}} Japanese film industry, when it began film processing businesses such as film developing. Photron was founded in 1974. Photron began manufacturing professional film, video and photo-instrumentation equipment in Japan. Photron expanded into <b>photo</b> <b>optics</b> and electronic technologies including the manufacture of high speed digital cameras. There is a mutual benefit between Photron and their parent company Imagica in sharing technology such as color science, broadcast expertise and image processing. Photron name combines photon and electron, the fundamental process of creating electronic digital images from light. Photron's early high-speed cameras were only available in Japan. Photron advanced their sensor technology in 1990 by working with Kinki University in Japan on a new design based on a block readout multichannel NMOS architecture. This new development produced a 256 pixel x 256 pixel x 4500 fps NMOS sensor which surpassed the fastest high-speed camera at that time, the Eastman Kodak SP2000 Motion analyzer (240 x 192 x 2000 fps). After 1991, Photron continued to manufacture and sell high-speed cameras into Asia. However, Photron wanted to make available their new sensor technology to serve other applications outside ASIA. Photron reached an agreement with Eastman Kodak MASD to manufacture for MASD two high-speed cameras, the HS 4540 and the Motioncorder trade branded as Kodak Ektapro products. These two products were sold by Eastman Kodak MASD into Europe, North America and parts of Asia until 2000. Photron assume worldwide responsibility of their products after 2000, naming the HS 4540 as the Photron FASTCAM SE and the Motioncorder as the Photron FASTCAM Super 10K.|$|E

According to the lecturer, for most of the students, this was the first time they presented content of a course and used MS PowerPoint. Although the students were not skilful in using MS PowerPoint for presenting, they exploited the software in the aspect of presenting information. For example, besides the content, diagrams and <b>photos</b> related to <b>optics,</b> the students showed the photos of scientists and their biographies. They looked for online learning resources by themselves besides traditional resources.|$|R
