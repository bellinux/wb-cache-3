40|$|A {{combined}} Survey {{involving the}} Very low frequency electromagnetic (VLF – EM) and Electrical resistivity surveys {{has been carried}} out in order to appraise the groundwater potential, and locate appropriate positions for siting boreholes in Ile- Ileri Community of Ado-Ekiti. VLF data were obtained along eight traverses as a first step in order to locate suitable VES stations. Vertical Electrical Soundings using Schlumberger array were thereafter carried out at twelve (12) locations. The integrated interpretation of both data confirm the presence of aquiferous units,which includes, weathered zone and basement transition/fractures beneath the area, which prior to this investigation have a history of failed boreholes and wells. The resistivity curve types obtained includes KH-,HKH-,HKHA-,HAA-,QQH- and H- which are diagnostic of weathered layer and transition zone / fractured layer aquifers in complementary pairings. The resulting geoelectric section from the interpretation revealed the presence of four subsurface layers including the top soil, which thickness varies from 0. 3 m to 2. 5 m,the weathered and transition/fractured zone’s whose thickness range is 7. 7 m – 36. 0 m. Two locations labelled BH 1 and BH 2 with appropriately thick overburden have been recommended in order of preference for the drilling of a producing borehole for the community. The significance of this study is such that it will assist in <b>profering</b> {{solution to the problem of}} water shortage occasioned by failed boreholes hitherto experienced in the community...|$|E
40|$|Background: According to {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) in 2003, more than 15 million Nigerian {{children under the age of}} 14 are working, mostly to help pay for the cost of going to school. The prevalence of child labour in Nigeria ranges from 20 % to 30 % and this is not without some untoward effects. This study, on parents' perception of the effects of child labour, becomes relevant since most of these children are forced to work by their parents. Objectives: This study is to determine the parents perception and the effects of child labour. Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study carried out among 352 parents in Nnewi, Anambra State. A multi-stage sampling technique was used in the study, and involved simple random sampling and the modified WHO cluster sampling techniques. Information was obtained using self-administered semi-structured questionnaires, and was analyzed with computer softwares. Results: The majority of the parents 79. 26 % (279) have good knowledge of child labour. Most of the parents 66. 19 % (216) consider child labour as hazardous, while 33. 81 % (136) believe it is beneficial. Adverse effects of child labour perceived by parents ' ranges from sexual harassment, teenage pregnancy, termination of formal education, to the contraction of sexually transmitted disease. Out of the 352 parents, 27. 96 % (78) admitted they practice child labour while 72. 04 % (201) did not. Conclusion: A careful consideration of the findings of this study will equip stakeholders with the necessary input for the enactment of policies, legislations and <b>profering</b> a lasting solution to this menace...|$|E
