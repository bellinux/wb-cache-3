40|$|This {{winter was}} pretty much a rerun of last, {{although}} perhaps not as severe; I could have used last winter 2 ̆ 7 s Introduction again. If there was an overall theme, {{it would be the}} widespread occurrences of species that would not be expected to linger into late December and January. Several species of waterbirds, notably Blue-winged Teal, scoters, Ruddy Duck, Common Loon, and Homed and Red-necked Grebes were in this category. Large numbers of Western Grebes were still at Lake McConaughy in early January, and surprisingly late individuals of Black-crowned Night-Heron and Plegadis ibis were located. Mourning Doves were in good numbers in the southeast, and, among passerines, Hermit Thrushes were in good numbers, also. Late surprises among sparrows included Clay-colored, Chipping, and Field. Other daringly late passerines included two (!) Ruby-crowned Kinglets at Ogallala in February, and a Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler in December in Scotts Bluff Co. Things are happening with some woodpeckers; for the second consecutive winter, Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers were everywhere, and Pileateds continue to expand their range northward in the Missouri Valley. This was a great year for Snow Buntings, even better than last year 2 ̆ 7 s good showing. Rarities were scarce; prominent of course was the carryover Ross 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gull</b> from fall, but almost unbelievable was another Ross 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gull</b> in Lancaster Co. in early December while the Gavins Point bird was still present. Also a carryover story, but apparently ending sadly, was the Brown-headed Nuthatch saga in Lincoln; 2 birds were last reported in mid-December, and the last sighting {{was at the end of}} January.

40|$|The {{most obvious}} pattern this spring was early arrivals, {{especially}} among the shorebirds. Dunlin arrived record early, and 5 other species were close to record early dates. However, warblers, sparrows, and buntings were pushing early dates and Brown-headed Cowbird was early in numbers. Winter finches were scarce except for Pine Siskin, which was present in good numbers, although breeding evidence was nonexistent. Glossy Ibis continued in numbers as did easterly Lazuli Buntings.

40|$|Notable this Fall {{was very}} heavy {{coverage}} of the Panhandle during Sep-Oct, which yielded several outstanding records (all, of course, pending NOURC approval). Incredible were first Panhandle records of Golden-winged, Chestnut-sided, Bay-breasted, and Prothonotary Warblers, 3 rd record of Northern Waterthrush, and 4 th record of Blackburnian Warbler. Philadelphia Vireo {{was found in the}} Panhandle for the 3 rd time. Important also were 3 records of Hammond 2 ̆ 7 s Flycatcher, the 3 rd- 6 th for the state, and likely a regular migrant, and 5 of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s vireo, previously known only by 2 specimens. Finally, from the Panhandle, 4 reports of Blue-Gray Gnatcatcher may be changing the status of this species there; there are still fewer than 10 such records. Just as significant were 2 surprising easterly records, Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Grebe in Lancaster Co and a Plumbeous Vireo in Stanton Co. Rarities independent of location were a potential 1 st state record Eurasian Collared-Dove at Shelton; the NOURC will decide if this was (is!) a wild bird.

40|$|The {{traditional}} mid-summer and midwinter 2 ̆ 2 windows 2 ̆ 2 wherein migrants {{were rarely}} detected have closed markedly {{in the last}} few years. The midwinter window is closing; where it once was around 20 Dec- 20 Feb it is now more like 5 Jan-to Feb. Many waterfowl were found in midwinter this season, and migrants such as Bluewinged Teal and Sandhill Crane appeared very early this spring. Similarly early were Turkey Vulture and Lincoln 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow. In light of waterbirds lingering late in fall, markedly lower numbers of Western Grebes were a surprise. Exotics were widely-reported; one, Pink-footed Goose, could possibly be a vagrant wild bird, while Egyptian Geese are certainly escaped or released captives.

40|$|On 5 October, 1997, {{we joined}} Joel G. Jorgensen and John Sullivan for a pelagic trip on Lake McConaughy. A similar trip in late September 1996 yielded a Sabine 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gull,</b> {{but we were}} really hoping to see a jaeger. From 7 : 00 to 8 : 30 a. m. we {{gradually}} worked our way from the dam towards {{the western end of}} the lake. Besides moderate numbers of Franklin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> and Ring-billed <b>Gulls,</b> there were few birds on the lake. At approximately 8 : 45 a. m. Dinsmore noticed that all of the gulls at the western end of the lake had suddenly taken flight. Less than a minute later, we simultaneously spotted a jaeger soaring directly overhead. The size, dark coloration, and prominent white flashes in the Wings identified the bird as a jaeger. The bird made a couple of attacks on Franklin Gulls and then flew east down the lake. We chased the jaeger for more than ten miles before losing it. We relocated the bird a short time later just above the dam. This time, the bird attacked a couple of Ring-billed Gulls before flying west up the lake. We again took chase, but lost the bird before reaching Lemoyne. The gull-like shape, generally brown coloration, and prominent white bases to the primaries identified the bird as a jaeger. The bird was smaller but longer-winged than a Ring-billed Gull and larger and slimmer than a Franklin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gull.</b> The overall coloration was dark brown, except for some warmer rufous tones on the underparts. We saw no visible barring on the underparts. The bill was straight and slender, but the color pattern was not noted. The upperwing was dark brown except for white at the base of at least the outermost four primaries. The underwing was also dark except for a prominent white area on the undersides of the bases of the primaries. The rectrices were dark and the central feathers were slightly elongated with pointed tips. We all agreed on the identification as a juvenile Parasitic Jaeger. Careful size comparisons to Franklin and Ring-billed Gulls eliminated juvenile Pomarine Jaeger, which also generally shows more white color on both surfaces of the wing. Juvenile Long-tailed Jaeger was eliminated {{on the basis of the}} pattern of white on the wing and size and wing proportions. We further concluded the bird was an intermediate or dark morph individual based on the dark plumage and lack of a contrasting paler head or rump. This represents the second accepted record of a Parasitic Jaeger for Nebraska. The only other record is of a juvenile picked up alive in Sheridan County on 23 Aug 1968 which died the next day (specimen number UNSM ZM 12309) (Gates, Doris. 1969.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{amount of}} work reporters put into their reports is tremendous. Putting the {{information}} into a readable format which preserves it for future use is a challenge, but always interesting. Reporters can report on their own forms if preferred; some do now, often because of computerized record-keeping systems. I [Ross Silcock] enter the data into my computer, and so almost anything is fine, as long as I can read it. It {{is not necessary to}} list every species, although {{it is difficult to know}} whether your dates of arrival, high counts, etc. are significant until compared with the others submitted. Perhaps the best way to save time and work reporting is to plan your system so that it is simple to report when the time comes. NOTABLE EVENTS There are several highlights among the data presented below. A long list of rarities included Eurasian Wigeon, Oldsquaw, Gyrfalcon, King Rail, Snowy Plover, Red Knot, Ruff (first Nebraska record), Thayer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gull,</b> Iceland Gull, Lesser Black-backed Gull, Great Black-backed Gull, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker, Cape May Warbler, Worm-eating Warbler, Connecticut Warbler, MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler (specimen in Lancaster County), Hooded Warbler, and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow. American Bittern is doing well in the Sandhills, as is Black-crowned Night-Heron, and especially Black-necked stilt. White-faced Ibis was also numerous, although it is not resident. Trumpeter Swan is present in the Sandhills in good numbers also, with several breeding pairs noted. This year, Cinnamon Teal was also present in good numbers. That these species are doing well speaks for the good condition of Sandhills waterbird habitats...|$|R
40|$|One {{immature}} {{was observed}} at Sutherland Reservoir, Lincoln County, on 17 December (myself) and 19 December (myself and Dorothy J. Rosche), 1992. I saw this bird {{a few hours after}} Silcock and Dinsmore discovered it on 17 Dec. [See article on p. 88. ] It flew {{by the end of the}} pier at close distances (as close as 20 feet) for hours on both days of observation. It sometimes landed momentarily on small pieces of ice as it picked up morsels floating in the water. It was a small gull and much more dainty than the nearby Bonaparte 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gulls.</b> It had a very small, rounded head and a very short, stubby, blackish bill. I believe it was a first-year bird molting into second-year plumage. The obviously wedge-shaped tail possessed well-worn tips. The only thing left of the dark tail band was a dark spot or two. The dark wing band of the immature was reduced to a short, dark bar on the inner wing, more noticeable on one side of the bird than the other (and very visible when the bird perched). The dark black collar marking was just beginning to appear, a small, darkish line being the only thing visible on each side of the head at this time. The pointed wings were rather uniformly gray on both sides; the trailing edge of the wing was whitish. The bird remained until 3 January, 1993, when it was last seen at the inlet to the reservoir. I personally visited with some 18 people who travelled to observe the bird from New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, and Florida...|$|R
40|$|This was {{a pretty}} routine fall for the most part, {{although}} there were scattered early and late dates and high counts as in most seasons. Decidedly non-routine, though, was the appearance of two rarities, Ross 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gull</b> and Brown-headed Nuthatch, both enjoyed by many. A surprising 15 gull species were reported, this without much help from L McConaughy! Also notable were the sea-ducks, scoters, and Long-tailed Duck, which were in good numbers. Tom Labedz, collections manager at the University of Nebraska State Museum, is an excellent source; he contributed greatly to discussions herein on Greater Prairie-Chicken and Fox Sparrow. A clarification: in the Spring Report I misleadingly implied that Eurasian Collared-Doves in Papillion were mostly feral, but I was referring only to a specific small group near Phil Swanson 2 ̆ 7 s house. As pointed out by Loren and Babs Padelford, there are increasing numbers of 2 ̆ 2 wild 2 ̆ 2 birds in Papillion. Generally, though, their presence in larger cities is lagging behind their rural small town ubiquity, especially in the west. I have expanded the 2 ̆ 2 Routine Reports 2 ̆ 2 statement to indicate what indeed is the routine status for such species. Generally, 2 ̆ 2 routine 2 ̆ 2 implies no early or late dates or high counts were reported for the particular season. I list all regularly occurring species for each season, {{the vast majority of}} which do indeed have reports of interest.

In a state with such a limited observer base, I think it is key that the few observers we have keep reporting and keep participating on counts. If they don 2 ̆ 7 t, birders and scientists 200 years will be greatly hindered. “Joel comes to this point after his meticulous research on historical accounts of birds in the Rainwater Basin, and understands very well how accurate information recorded now can be of great benefit many years hence. And so, back to the birds: given the fairly mild conditions in fall, the expected collection of lingering waterfowl was duly noted, especially grebes, cormorant, pelican, and herons. Noteworthy was the latest ever Great Egret. Greater Yellowlegs and Long-billed Dowitcher were reported in December, and Bonaparte 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gull</b> in January. The mildness of the late fall may have stimulated a group of prairie-chickens in north-central Nebraska to engage in booming on 28 December! Fewer late passerines were reported, but Gray Catbird, Orange-crowned Warbler, and Chipping Sparrow were among them, along with a real surprise, a Palm Warbler, which provided the only November or December record for the state...|$|R
40|$|This rather mild season {{stood out}} for its {{wintering}} waterfowl, most obviously at Keystone L, where Stephen Dinsmore counted an amazing 22 species of waterfowl on 29 January. Check the species {{accounts for the}} incredible wintering numbers; species were topped by Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s first Tufted Duck, and assorted other goodies, such as 5 Barrow 2 ̆ 7 s Goldeneyes, Waterfowl, loons, and grebes also rewrote the midwinter record book, including no fewer than 3 Red-necked Grebes, Some interesting wintering birds also appeared at Harlan Co Res, Other interesting winter records, some no doubt due to the mild fall, included Greater Yellowlegs at two locations, Franklin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gull</b> and an adult Black-legged Kittiwake at Harlan Co Res, wintering Hermit Thrush at L Ogallala, a January Gray Catbird in the northwest, a male Dickcissel at Alma, and Orange-erowned and Northern Parula warblers in December, the latter at Keystone L! Sparrows which generally winter only very rarely in NE were well-represented, although poorly-documented, including a Smith 2 ̆ 7 s Longspur in Cass Co, Present in good numbers were Northern Shrike and Purple Finch, the latter welcome after some low years, and Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Solitaire appeared in low numbers. The Eurasian Collared-Dove continued its expansion in the state, even breeding during the winter period! Westerly reports involved a Red-bellied Woodpecker in Scotts Bluff Co, Carolina Wrens pushing westward, and Winter Wrens wintering in the L McConaughy area, This winter produced some outstanding rarities also, Hiding among the numerous scaup,a Tufted Duck at Keystone L proved a frustrating dip-twitch for many, while a Pomarine Jaeger and Mew Gull were well seen only by one Stephen Dinsmore (who also found, and refound many times for others, the Tufted Duck), Possibly most frustrating was what would likely have been a first state record Slaty-backed Gull at Harlan Co Res, {{which could not be}} refound despite a two-day search, A tantalizing record was of Golden-crowned Sparrows in Cherry Co in early December, the 2 nd winter in a row for this species. A Dark-eyed (Gray-headed) Junco was spotted in Papillion, and a couple of White-winged Crossbills were found...|$|R
40|$|This fall we {{received}} numerous excellent reports {{from which to}} compile this summary. Most {{parts of the state}} are covered, except the southwest and north central, although many observers at least pass through those areas. A note about details on unusual observations. The new NOU Field Card, which can be ordered by sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope to the NOU Librarian, Univ of Nebraska State Museum, Lincoln, NE 68588 - 0514, indicates species that need complete documentations, mostly casual and accidental species. However, we realize that information about early and late migration dates, and rarity in the west or east is not readily available, so in this summary we have indicated significant reports that were not accompanied by details on the sighting by using the phrase 2 ̆ 2 no details provided 2 ̆ 2 or something similar. We would very much appreciate it if observers of these reports could provide details of the sighting, including identification points and circumstances such as habitat, viewing conditions, etc. These reports are as important as those of rare birds, and {{it would be nice to}} have them substantiated. Of course sightings discussed in this report are always subject to acceptance by the NOU Records Committee; reports with asterisks denote those for which written documentation has been submitted to the NOU Records Committee. And now to the good stuff! This fall was interesting from many aspects. Several species of waterbirds, considered accidental or casual a few years ago, were well reported this year, including Red-throated Loon, Pacific Loon, Red-necked Grebe, Black Scoter, and Sabine 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gull.</b> A discussion is included about hummingbirds in w NE, several of which were noted early this fall (hummingbird mania?). Few Catharus thrushes were noted, no Veeries and only 2 Swainson 2 ̆ 7 s Thrushes. Unprecedented numbers of Sage Thrashers were noted in Kimball Co, and excellent numbers of Palm and Blackburnian Warblers showed up, including the 3 rd fall record for the panhandle region for Blackburnian. Good information is being received about the ranges of Eastern and Spotted Towhees...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by {{an appeal}} to the {{community}} from Walborn (these proceedings) we decided to solve the long-standing problem concerning the nature of the 4486, 4504 A emission lines, which are frequently observed in O-type spectra and which are particularly prominent in supergiants. We claim that these lines emerge from sulfur, namely by de-excitation of a highly excited S IV doublet state. We prove this by an exploratory NLTE calculation with a detailed model atom.
