40|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>rope</b> is a versatile, flexible, {{high-strength}} member {{that is used}} in many mechanical systems. However, due to {{the complexity}} of <b>wire</b> <b>rope,</b> analytical investigations have been relatively limited. Previous attempts to create simplified models of <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> were not validated with physical testing and used a cumbersome beam-and-shell or beam-and-solid method for simulating the <b>wire</b> <b>rope.</b> An improved LS-DYNA model of 19 -mm diameter 3 x 7 <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> commonly used in roadside cable guardrail installations has been developed. A Belytschko-Schwer beam element was selected along with material *MAT_ 166. Since <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> displays internal damping due to friction of strands and wires, low-frequency bending modes of <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> were damped in the model using the LS-DYNA frequency range command, and high-frequency noise was reducing using the part stiffness damping. The optimum element length based on timestep, accuracy, and computational cost was determined to be between 0. 4 and 0. 8 in. (10 - 20 mm). Dynamic component tests were conducted on <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> to determine material properties, and consisted of high-speed jerk tests of <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> constrained at one end, and perpendicular impact of <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> constrained at both ends. These tests were simulated and the results compared to the physical tests. The new proposed <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> model more accurately simulated the <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> tension and bogie vehicle motion than previously-developed <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> models. The <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> was also modeled in full-scale crash test models using a Chevrolet C 2500 pickup model, consistent with NCHRP Report No. 350 TL- 3 impact conditions. Results of the crash test and simulation were compared, the <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> response was determined to be accurate, though the <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> released from the hook bolts prematurely. Nonetheless, <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> response, vehicle motion and trajectory were accurate. Therefore the new <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> model was determined to be an improvement over existing models of <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> and is recommended for use in cable guardrail simulations.

40|$|AbstractThe {{modeling}} method and dynamical characteristics of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> {{has been researched}} for several decades. In the past, steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> were usually modeled as a two dimensional system, which was only suitable for the planar motion. Also, no kink-wave propagation was considered when steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> were used in relatively low speed engineering application areas. By contrast, a three dimensional approach to model steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> used in high energy absorber apparatus is presented in this paper. Three dimensional contacts between steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> and other objects and kink-wave propagation in steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> are taken into consideration when applying the new approach to model steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes.</b> Compared to the two dimensional model of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes,</b> the proposed model regards steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> as a multi-body system consisting of identical cylindrical elements with {{6 degrees of freedom}} connected by space constraints. Impact forces generated by three dimensional contacts between steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> and other objects are calculated and theories of elastic wave propagation are applied to analyze the kink-wave propagation when steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> are loaded with a sudden perpendicular impact by a high speed moving object. In addition, mathematical model of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> is established and numerical simulation of the three dimensional model of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> is implemented. By comparing the simulation results with the experimental data available, the model of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> proposed in this paper is demonstrated to be valid and correct. Therefore, the proposed {{modeling method}} can be treated as a new approach in the research field of modeling steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes.</b> The dynamical characteristics of the steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> based on this new modeling approach are addressed simultaneously and plots of the dynamics of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> cannot only be regarded as a basis for the further comparative studies, but also can provide some significant and interesting results...|$|R

40|$|YesThe current paper {{presents}} a simple unbonded-type column strengthening technique with <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> units and few steel elements. Eleven short columns were strengthened using the proposed procedure and tested under monotonic concentric axial loads. The main variables investigated {{to evaluate the}} confinement effectiveness of strengthened concrete columns were the volume ratio, prestress, diameter, spacing and configuration of <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> units. The strength gain factor and ductility ratio increased {{with the increase of}} volume ratio of <b>wire</b> <b>ropes.</b> The prestress applied to <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> had little influence on the strength gain factor but the ductility ratio decreased with the increase of prestress in the <b>wire</b> <b>ropes,</b> owing to earlier rupture of <b>wire</b> <b>ropes.</b> At the same volume ratio of <b>wire</b> <b>ropes,</b> the maximum strength of columns was nearly independent on the configuration of the <b>wire</b> <b>ropes,</b> but higher ductility was exhibited by columns strengthened with rectangular spiral-type <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> than by columns strengthened with hoop-type <b>wire</b> <b>ropes,</b> until rupture of the <b>wire</b> <b>ropes.</b> The strength gain factor and ductility ratio of strengthened columns were compared with those of tied columns tested in a previous study.

Ten two-span reinforced concrete T-beams externally strengthened with <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> units and an unstrengthened control beam were tested to failure, {{to explore the}} significance and shortcomings of the developed unbonded-type shear strengthening technique. The main parameters investigated were the type, amount and prestressing force of <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> units. All beams tested failed, owing to significant diagonal cracks within the interior shear span. However, beams strengthened with closed type <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> units exhibited more ductile failure than the unstrengthened, control beam or those strengthened with U-type <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> units. The diagonal cracking load and ultimate shear capacity of beams with closed-type were linearly increased {{with the increase of}} vertical confinement stresses in concrete owing to the prestressing force in <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> units, while those of beams with U-type were minimally influenced. It was also observed that average stresses in closed-type <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> crossing diagonal cracks at ultimate strength of beams tested were much higher than those in U-type <b>wire</b> <b>ropes,</b> showing better utilization in the former case. The shear capacity of beams with closed-type <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> units is conservatively predicted using the equations of ACI 318 - 05, modified to account for the external <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> units.
