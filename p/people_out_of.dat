5|$|Another {{criticism}} is that outcomes {{are presented in}} terms of relative risk reduction to exaggerate the apparent benefits of the treatment. For example, he writes, if four <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 1,000 will {{have a heart attack}} within the year, but on statins only two will, that is a 50 percent reduction if expressed as relative risk reduction. But if expressed as absolute risk reduction, it is a reduction of just 0.2 percent.|$|E

More than a thousand <b>people</b> (<b>out</b> <b>of</b> a population of around 16,000) committed suicide in Demmin on and around 1 May 1945 as the 65th Army of 2nd Belorussian Front first broke into a distillery and then rampaged through the town, committing mass rapes, arbitrarily executing civilians and setting fire to buildings.

5|$|A minor {{incident}} in the K'iche' capital Q'umarkaj escalated to have important consequences. A K'iche' soldier tried to seize bread from a Kaqchikel woman who was selling it in the market. The woman refused the soldier and drove him off with a stick. The Kaqchikel demanded {{the execution of the}} K'iche' soldier while the K'iche' nobility demanded the punishment of the Kaqchikel bread seller. When the Kaqchikel lords refused to hand her over, the K'iche' lords sentenced Hun-Toh and Wuqu-Batz' to death against the wishes of the K'iche' king K'iq'ab. King K'iq'ab warned his Kaqchikel friends and advised them to flee Q'umarkaj. On the day 13 Iq' of the Kaqchikel calendar the four lords of the Kaqchikel led their <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the K'iche' capital to found their own capital at Iximche. The exact year of this event is not known with certainty but {{is believed to have been}} between AD 1470 and 1485, with some scholars, such as Guillemín, preferring 1470. The Kaqchikel abandoned their previous capital Chiavar (speculated to be modern Chichicastenango) because it was too close to Q'umarkaj.|$|E

Thousands of residents and tourists were in the region following the New Year's holiday. Meteorologists warned that the oceans would be increasingly dangerous and advised people not to venture into the water. Every lifeguard in Whangamata, as well as former lifeguards, were called in to assist in keeping an estimated 8,000 <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water. Although most people stayed within a designated swimming area, several rescues had to be made.

5|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} {{were initially}} issued for {{areas of the}} Gulf Coast between Morgan City, Louisiana and Corpus Christi, Texas, but were later moved eastward to coastal regions between Pensacola, Florida and New Orleans as the hurricane progressed closer to the coast. Additional marine warnings were also issued for offshore regions that could be potentially affected by the hurricane, and boats were evacuated into Gulf Coast ports. Onshore, freight trains on Galveston Island were moved to the mainland {{in preparation for the}} storm. Interurban railways also evacuated <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the island, with an estimated 4,500people being evacuated. The United States Coast Guard were ordered to be ready for immediate service {{in the event of an}} emergency, while the US National Guard on strike duty in Galveston's Camp Hutchings were transferred to a barracks in Fort Crockett. Oil companies abandoned operations in coastal oil fields in advance of the hurricane. People along Lake Ponchartrain evacuated into New Orleans, causing hotels to overflow and forcing refugees to take shelter in other public buildings including post offices.|$|E

The Congress party initiated its election campaign in January 2014. It gave extra focus to the new middle class of India which was above the poverty line but not enough rich to be in middle class. This new economic class comprises 700 million <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the country's total population of 1.2 billion.

Power outages spurred by Odile's intense winds and rain cut electricity to 92%of the population of Baja California Sur. Severe flooding also occurred, causing rivers to swell and the mass evacuation of <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hazardous low-lying areas. The remnants of Odile brought rains and unseasonably powerful thunderstorms to the southwestern United States. In total, Odile led {{to the deaths of}} 18people throughout its nine-day existence.|$|E

5|$|There are {{side effects}} and risks {{associated}} with the smallpox vaccine.

Potentially life-threatening reactions occurred in 14 to 500 <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> every 1 million people vaccinated for the first time.

Residents who met the requirements to receive federal aid were eligible for funding for temporary housing.

Residents were able to receive up to $200,000 for home damages; up to $40,000 in personal possession losses; and up to $2million for business losses. By October17, more than $5.6million in disaster aid was approved for 20,284 residences. Community Relations teams visited about 7,000 <b>people.</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> the 4,140 small-business loans applications, only 288 were submitted by this time. By October25, the amount of funds nearly doubled, reaching $11million. At this time, more than, 24,500 residents applied for disaster loans. Survey teams checked over 18,000 homes for flood-related damages at this time also. Funding reached $16.5million by November7, with 29,000 people requesting federal assistance. By December5, funding for 37,000 residents reached $23.1million. At this time, the deadline for federal assistance requests was set for January15, 2009. On January2, 2009, funding for small businesses was being provided, with $6million being contributed. Grants for residents also reached $25million.

5|$|The Duke of Wellington {{felt that}} the {{remainder}} of the day's events should be cancelled following the accident at Parkside, and proposed to return to Liverpool. However, a large crowd had gathered in Manchester to see the trains arrive, and was beginning to become unruly. Wellington was persuaded to continue to Manchester. By the time the trains reached the outskirts of Manchester the crowd had become hostile and was spilling onto the tracks. With local authorities unable to clear the tracks, the trains were obliged to drive at low speed into the crowd, using their own momentum to push <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way. Eventually they arrived at Liverpool Road railway station in Manchester to be met by a hostile crowd, who waved banners and flags against the Duke and pelted him with vegetables. Wellington refused to get off the train, and ordered that the trains return to Liverpool. Mechanical failures and an inability to turn the locomotives meant that most of the trains were unable to leave Manchester. While the Duke of Wellington's train left successfully, only three of the remaining seven locomotives were usable. These three locomotives slowly hauled a single long train of 24 carriages back to Liverpool, eventually arriving 6 hours late after having been pelted with objects thrown from bridges by the drunken crowds lining the track.|$|E
