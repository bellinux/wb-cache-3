5|$|The Romans {{formally}} disestablished the Macedonian monarchy {{by installing}} four separate allied republics in its stead, their capitals located at Amphipolis, Thessalonica, Pella, and Pelagonia. The Romans imposed severe laws inhibiting many {{social and economic}} interactions between the inhabitants of these respective republics, including the banning of marriages {{between them and the}} (temporary) <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of Macedonia's gold and silver mines. However, a certain Andriscus claiming Antigonid descent rebelled against the Romans and was pronounced king of Macedonia, defeating the army of the Roman praetor Publius Iuventius Thalna during the Fourth Macedonian War (150–148 BC). Despite this, Andriscus was defeated in 148 BC at the second Battle of Pydna by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus, whose forces occupied the kingdom. This was followed in 146 BC by the Roman destruction of Carthage and victory over the Achaean League at the Battle of Corinth, ushering in the era of Roman Greece and the gradual establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia.|$|E

In 2002, Belgium announced that it was working toward a ban on all primate use, and in the UK, 103 MPs signed an Early Day Motion calling for an end to primate experiments, arguing that they cause suffering and are unreliable. No licenses for research on great apes have been issued in the UK since 1998.

25|$|Established in 2011, SPD {{operates}} {{a network of}} 140 surveillance cameras called the Criminal Observation and Protection System (COPS). Between 2011 and 2014 more than 40 utility pole mounted cameras were installed, mainly in the Southwest and Northeast neighborhoods. The cameras were funded by federal, state, and private grants. In Summer 2014, 10 cameras were approved for installation in Downtown Syracuse, the first area not targeted because of high levels of violent crime. Live monitoring of Clinton Square for suspicious people during events and festivals was planned, although police agreed to a <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of cameras to monitor protests. Twenty-five additional cameras were planned to be installed in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the War in Chechnya spawned {{new forms}} of separatist {{activities}} in the Russian Federation. Resistance to the conscription of men from minority ethnic groups to fight in Chechnya was widespread among other republics, many of which passed laws and decrees on the subject. For example, the government of Chuvashia passed a decree providing legal protection to soldiers from the republic who refused {{to participate in the}} Chechen war and imposed limits {{on the use of the}} federal army in ethnic or regional conflicts within Russia. Some regional and local legislative bodies called for the <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of draftees in quelling internal conflicts, while others demanded a total ban on the use of the armed forces in such situations. Russian government officials feared that a move to end the war short of victory would create a cascade of secession attempts by other ethnic minorities.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Orakhelashvili cites {{a number}} {{cases in which}} {{international}} tribunals have ruled that international organizations, including the Security Council, are bound by general international law. He says that inclusion of explicit clauses about the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and requiring respect of territorial integrity and sovereignty of a state demonstrates that the Council {{does not intend to}} offend peremptory norms in these specific ways. The resolution also acknowledges that these principles must be part of an accepted settlement. That is confirmed by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which reiterates the <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of force and provides that any settlement obtained by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations or conflicting with a peremptory norm of general international law is invalid.

2500|$|This {{view of the}} Free Exercise Clause {{would begin}} to narrow again in the 1980s, {{culminating}} in the 1990 case of Employment Division v. Smith. [...] Examining a state <b>prohibition</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of peyote, the Supreme Court upheld the law despite the drug's use {{as part of a}} religious ritual, and without employing the strict scrutiny test. [...] Instead, the Court again held that a [...] "neutral law of general applicability" [...] generally does not implicate the Free Exercise Clause. [...] This was followed by intense disapproval from Congress and the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 1993 to attempt to restore the prior test. [...] However, in City of Boerne v. Flores, the Supreme Court struck down the act as applied to the States, holding that it unconstitutionally attempted to usurp the Supreme Court's role in interpreting the Constitution, thus leaving the Smith test in place.|$|E
