40|$|Policies have {{traditionally}} been a way to specify properties of a system. In this paper, we show how policies {{can be applied to}} Organization-based Multiagent Systems Engineering (O-MaSE) [6], specifically, in the OMACS meta-model. In OMACS, policies may constrain assignments of agents to roles, the structure of the goal model for the organization, or how an agent may play a particular role. We also show how traditional policies can be characterized as law policies. Law policies must always be followed by a system. Because of this inflexibility, law policies may constrain a multiagent system too much. In order to preserve flexibility of the system, while still being able to guide the system into preferring certain behaviors, we introduce the concept of <b>guidance</b> <b>policies.</b> These so-called <b>guidance</b> <b>policies</b> need not always be followed.

Lovestone's mission was to eliminate pro-Communist unions and supplant them with unions which supported capitalism. The Central Intelligence Agency funneled millions of dollars through FTUC in support of American foreign policy goals.|$|E

500|$|Jones' career {{took place}} against a {{backdrop}} of increasing professionalization and commercialization of archaeology, which Jones herself had a hand in birthing. During her work as a freelance archaeologist for the Ministry of Works in the 1950s and 60s, Jones saw the rapid destruction of archaeological sites by construction and development, and bemoaned the lack of resources allocated to properly documenting it. Jones and her colleagues were paid only a day-rate for time spent digging and the costs directly incurred, precluding any post-excavation analysis or publication of their finds. Although Mucking was the largest excavation in the country for over a decade, she ran it on a shoestring budget, relying heavily on volunteer labour. In 1973 she was involved in founding the campaign group Rescue, which lobbied for increased government funding for rescue archaeology. This initiative was ultimately successful, increasingly shifting the labour of pre-development excavation from volunteers to professional archaeologists, and culminating in the creation of modern commercial archaeology with the publication of Planning <b>Policy</b> <b>Guidance</b> Note 16 in 1991. According to her obituarist Mike Pitts, Jones also influenced the formation of modern rescue archaeology in Britain by demonstrating [...] "dogged salvage excavation on a grand scale" [...] at Mucking.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Policies have {{traditionally}} been a way to specify properties of a system. In this paper, we show how policies {{can be applied to}} Organization-based Multiagent Systems Engineering (O-MaSE) [1], specifically in the Organization Model for Adaptive Computational Systems (OMACS) [2]. In OMACS, policies may constrain assignments of agents to roles, the structure of the goal model for the organization, or how an agent may play a particular role. In this paper, we focus on policies limiting system traces; this is done to leverage the work already done for specification and verification of properties in concurrent programs. We show how traditional policies can be characterized as law policies; that is, they must always be followed by a system. In the context of multiagent systems, law policies limit the flexibility of the system. Thus, in order to preserve the system flexibility while still being able to guide the system into preferring certain behaviors, we introduce the concept of <b>guidance</b> <b>policies.</b> These <b>guidance</b> <b>policies</b> need not always be followed; when the system cannot continue with the <b>guidance</b> <b>policies,</b> they may be suspended. We show how this can guide how the system achieves the top-level goal while not decreasing flexibility of the system. <b>Guidance</b> <b>policies</b> are formally defined and, since multiple <b>guidance</b> <b>policies</b> can introduce conflicts, a strategy for resolving conflicts is given. ...|$|R
