5000|$|The {{pressure}} angle {{is also the}} angle of the sides of the trapezoidal teeth on the corresponding rack.The force transmitted during the mating of gear teeth acts along the normal. This force has components along the <b>pitch</b> <b>line</b> and the other along the line perpendicular to the <b>pitch</b> <b>line.</b> The force along the <b>pitch</b> <b>line</b> which is responsible for power transmission is proportional to the cosine of {{pressure angle}}. The one which exerts thrust(perpendicular to the <b>pitch</b> <b>line)</b> is proportional to the sine of pressure angle. So it is advised to keep the pressure angle low. Standard pressure values are 14.5 and 20 degrees.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} in non-circular gears design, based on the mathematical description of the meshing progress. The teeth profiles are generated by numerical integration of a differential equation, which describes the contact point displacement, {{along the line of}} action, {{as a function of the}} <b>pitch</b> <b>lines</b> shape and of the pressure angle. In the typical arrangement, a pair of non-circular gears is used to drive a slider-crank mechanism, whose cursor follows a prescribed law of motion, thus working as a function generator. A procedure of inverse kinematics is illustrated, to determine the variable transmission ratio and then the pitch curves, once given the geometry of the slider-crank mechanism and the distance between the gears centres of rotation. An application of the method is described, where the ram of a mechanical press is driven according to a cinematically optimized law of motion. First step is the <b>pitch</b> <b>lines</b> synthesis, starting from the prescribed output curve. The teeth profiles are then generated on the primitives previously determined. A virtual analysis is performed to validate the method...|$|R
50|$|One {{problem with}} roller chains is the {{variation}} in speed, or surging, caused by the acceleration and deceleration of the chain as it goes around the sprocket link by link. It starts {{as soon as the}} <b>pitch</b> <b>line</b> of the chain contacts the first tooth of the sprocket. This contact occurs at a point below the pitch circle of the sprocket. As the sprocket rotates, the chain is raised up to the pitch circle and is then dropped down again as sprocket rotation continues. Because of the fixed pitch length, the <b>pitch</b> <b>line</b> of the link cuts across the chord between two pitch points on the sprocket, remaining in this position relative to the sprocket until the link exits the sprocket. This rising and falling of the <b>pitch</b> <b>line</b> is what causes chordal effect or speed variation.|$|E

40|$|In two experiments, {{visually}} perceived {{eye level}} (VPEL) was measured while subjects viewed two-dimensional displays that were either upright or pitched 20 degrees top-toward or 20 degrees top-away from them. In Experiment 1, it was demonstrated that binocular {{exposure to a}} pair of <b>pitched</b> vertical <b>lines</b> or to a pitched random dot pattern caused a substantial upward VPEL shift for the top-toward pitched array and a similarly large downward shift for the top-away array. On the other hand, the same pitches of a pair of horizontal lines (viewed binocularly or monocularly) produced much smaller VPEL shifts. Because the perceived pitch of the <b>pitched</b> horizontal <b>line</b> display was nearly the same as the perceived pitch of the <b>pitched</b> vertical <b>line</b> and dot array, the relatively small influence of <b>pitched</b> horizontal <b>lines</b> on VPEL cannot be attributed simply to an underestimation of their pitch. In Experiment 2, the effects of <b>pitched</b> vertical <b>lines,</b> dots, and horizontal lines on VPEL were again measured, together with their effects on resting gaze direction (in the vertical dimension). As in Experiment 1, vertical lines and dots caused much larger VPEL shifts than did horizontal lines. The effects of the displays on resting gaze direction were highly similar to their effects on VPEL. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that VPEL shifts caused by pitched visual arrays are due to the direct influence of these arrays on the oculomotor system and are not mediated by perceived pitch...|$|R

50|$|The angled teeth engage more {{gradually}} than do {{spur gear}} teeth, {{causing them to}} run more smoothly and quietly. With parallel helical gears, each pair of teeth first make contact at a single point at {{one side of the}} gear wheel; a moving curve of contact then grows gradually across the tooth face to a maximum, then recedes until the teeth break contact at a single point on the opposite side. In spur gears, teeth suddenly meet at a line contact across their entire width, causing stress and noise. Spur gears make a characteristic whine at high speeds. For this reason spur gears are used in low-speed applications and in situations where noise control is not a problem, and helical gears are used in high-speed applications, large power transmission, or where noise abatement is important. The speed is considered high when the <b>pitch</b> <b>line</b> velocity exceeds 25 m/s.|$|E

40|$|After an {{extensive}} {{research on the}} fundamental theory, the theoretical basis for the Logix gearing will be presented in this paper. This includes the theory for gear meshing with high degree of contact. In comparison to previous studies, the theory {{of this paper is}} more restricted going beyond third order parameters into the fourth order, the teeth profile had one order of contact higher than that of the Logix gearing. So that further improved the contact strength of tooth profile. A large category of gearings with high order of contact was presented, while the Logix gear is only one of them, or the special example in realization of my theory. In the Logix gearing, the zigzag curvature center curve of media rack does not always lay about the <b>pitch</b> <b>line</b> and does not extend along the <b>pitch</b> <b>line</b> continuously and steadily.
