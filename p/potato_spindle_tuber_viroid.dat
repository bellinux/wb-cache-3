50|$|Pospiviroid is a genus of viroid {{which most}} {{commonly}} infects tubers. It {{belongs to the}} family pospiviroidae.The first viroid discovered was a pospiviroid, the PSTVd species (<b>potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>viroid).</b>|$|E
50|$|The first {{recognized}} viroid, the {{pathogenic agent}} of the potato spindle tuber disease, was discovered, initially molecularly characterized, and named by Theodor Otto Diener, plant pathologist at the U.S Department of Agriculture's Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland, in 1971. This viroid is now called <b>Potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>viroid,</b> abbreviated PSTVd.|$|E
40|$|The 69 {{nucleotide}} left-terminal domain (T(L)) of the <b>potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> RNA <b>viroid</b> (PSTVd) constitutes one of {{its five}} structural elements. Due to a twofold complementary sequence repeat, two possible conformations are proposed for the T(L) secondary structure; an elongated-rod and a bifurcated form. In the present study, two T(L) mutants were designed that remove the symmetry of the sequence repeats and ensure that either the bifurcated or the elongated-rod conformation is thermodynamically favored. Imino 1 H and 15 N resonances were assigned for both mutants and the native T(L) domain based on 1 H- 1 H NOESY and heteronuclear 1 H- 15 N HSQC high-resolution NMR spectra. The NMR secondary structure analysis of all constructs establishes unambiguously the elongated-rod form as the secondary structure of the native T(L) domain. Temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis and UV melting experiments corroborate these results. A combined secondary structure and sequence analysis of T(L) domains of other Pospiviroidae family members indicates that the elongated-rod form is thermodynamically favored {{for the vast majority}} of these viroids...|$|R
40|$|The 359 {{nucleotides}} (nt) long <b>potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> prototype <b>viroid</b> (PSTVd) {{is sensitive}} to experimentally introduced mutations as the substitution or deletion of a single nucleotide usually abolishes its infectivity, although certain sequence alterations are tolerated. This {{is illustrated by the}} fact that viroid progeny can evolve in planta upon inoculation with substitution mutants generated in vitro, and by the existence of genetically stable 356 - 360 nt long PSTVd field isolates. However, to date, no viable in vitro-generated deletion mutant of PSTVd has been reported. We have now found a 341 nt long infectious PSTVd RNA replicon that evolved in agrotransformed plants transformed with the dimeric form of an in vitro-deleted, non-infectious 350 bp long PSTVd cDNA unit by an additional complementary deletion of 9 nt in vivo. This is the first report that the deletion-abolished infectivity of a viroid is restored by an additional deletion that concurrently restabilized its perturbed secondary structure by abandoning an internal segment of the rod-like molecule. The fact that approximately 5 % of the total PSTVd RNA genome was deleted demonstrates that the maintenance of this viroid-specific rod-like structure is not only essential for nuclease protection but also for the infectivity, i. e. transmissibility, replicability, processibility and pathogenicity of these minimal infectious agents...|$|R
40|$|The {{sequence}} polymorphism and population structure of Tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid (TCDVd) (isolate Trust) and <b>Potato</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>viroid</b> (PSTVd) (isolate FN) in tomato plants were investigated. Of the 9 and 35 TCDVd clones sequenced from 2 different TCDVd-infected plants, 2 and 4 sequence variants were identified, respectively, {{leading to a}} total of 4 sequence variants of 360 nucleotides in length. Variant I was identical to AF 162131, the first TCDVd sequence to be reported, and the rest exhibited 1 to 3 nucleotide differences, all in the TR domain, from AF 162131 /variant I. Of the 33 and  29  PSTVd clones sequenced from 2 different PSTVd-infected plants, 8 and 9 sequence variants were found, respectively, leading {{to a total of}} 15 variants ranging in length from  356 to 359 nucleotides. The variant I was identical to EF 044303, a PSTVd reported in Russia. The rest exhibited 1 to 11 nucleotide differences scattering in all five domains from EF 044303 /variant I. The results demonstrated {{for the first time that}} TCDVd, like many other viroids including PSTVd, exists in host plants as a collective group comprised of various sequence variants. However, in comparison to PSTVd, TCDVd is less polymorphic in tomato plants as fewer variants and lower haplotype/nucleotide diversities were observed...|$|R
50|$|The single-strandedness and {{circularity}} of viroids {{was confirmed}} by electron microscopy, and Gross et al. determined the complete nucleotide sequence of <b>potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>viroid</b> in 1978. PSTVd was the first pathogen of a eukaryotic organism for which the complete molecular structure has been established. Over thirty plant diseases have since been identified as viroid-, not virus-caused, as had been assumed.|$|E
50|$|The Pospiviroid RY motif stem loop is an RNA element {{found in}} Pospiviroids such as <b>potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>viroid</b> (PSTVd). The RY {{nucleotide}} sequence motif (5'-ACAGG and CUCUUCC-5') in PSTVd, {{is thought to}} bind with the tomato protein Virp1. The exact function of this motif and the significance of Virp1 binding is unknown. It is however thought that RY motifs are essential for establishing a viroid infection.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>viroid</b> ("PSTVd") was {{the first}} viroid to be identified. PSTVd is a small, {{circular}} RNA molecule {{closely related to the}} chrysanthemum stunt viroid. Present within the viroidal RNA is the Pospiviroid RY motif stem loop. The natural hosts are potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum). All potatoes and tomatoes are susceptible to PSTVd and there is no form of natural resistance. Natural infections have also been seen in avocados and infections in other solanaceous crops have been induced in the laboratory.|$|E

50|$|In the 1920s, {{symptoms}} of a previously unknown potato disease were noticed in New York and New Jersey fields. Because tubers on affected plants become elongated and misshapen, they named it the <b>potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> disease.|$|R
40|$|The {{infectious}} {{ribonucleic acid}} (RNA) of <b>potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> virus (PSTV) can be separated by hydroxyapatite chromatography from double-stranded RNA detectable in low amounts in both infected and uninfected plant tissue extracts.

5000|$|In 1976, Sänger et al. {{presented}} {{evidence that}} <b>potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>viroid</b> is a [...] "single-stranded, covalently closed, circular RNA molecule, existing {{as a highly}} base-paired rod-like structure"—believed {{to be the first}} such molecule described. Circular RNA, unlike linear RNA, forms a covalently closed continuous loop, in which the 3' and 5' ends present in linear RNA molecules have been joined together. Sänger et al. also provided evidence for the true circularity of viroids by finding that the RNA could not be phosphorylated at the 5' terminus. Then, in other tests, they failed to find even one free 3' end, which ruled out the possibility of the molecule having two 3’ ends. Viroids thus are true circular RNAs.|$|E
50|$|There {{has long}} been {{uncertainty}} over how viroids induce symptoms in plants without encoding any protein products within their sequences. Evidence suggests that RNA silencing {{is involved in the}} process. First, changes to the viroid genome can dramatically alter its virulence. This reflects the fact that any siRNAs produced would have less complementary base pairing with target messenger RNA. Secondly, siRNAs corresponding to sequences from viroid genomes have been isolated from infected plants. Finally, transgenic expression of the noninfectious hpRNA of <b>potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>viroid</b> develops all the corresponding viroid-like symptoms. This indicates that when viroids replicate via a double stranded intermediate RNA, they are targeted by a dicer enzyme and cleaved into siRNAs that are then loaded onto the RNA-induced silencing complex. The viroid siRNAs contain sequences capable of complementary base pairing with the plant's own messenger RNAs, and induction of degradation or inhibition of translation causes the classic viroid symptoms.|$|E

50|$|Theodor Otto Diener (born February 28, 1921) is the Swiss-American plant {{pathologist}} who, in 1971, {{discovered that the}} causative agent of the <b>potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> disease is not a virus, but a novel agent, which consists solely of a short strand of single-stranded RNA without a protein capsid, eighty times smaller than the smallest viruses. He proposed to name it and similar agents to be discovered viroids.Viroids displace viruses as the smallest infectious agents known.|$|R
50|$|The {{symptoms}} {{appeared on}} plants onto which pieces from affected plants had been budded—indicating {{that the disease}} {{was caused by a}} transmissible pathogenic agent. However, a fungus or bacterium could not be found consistently associated with symptom-bearing plants, and therefore, it was assumed the disease was caused by a virus. Despite numerous attempts over the years to isolate and purify the assumed virus, using increasingly sophisticated methods, these were unsuccessful when applied to extracts from <b>potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> disease-afflicted plants.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPotato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>viroid</b> (PSTVd) {{is a small}} plant {{pathogenic}} circular RNA {{that does}} not encode proteins, replicates autonomously, and traffics systemically in infected plants. Long-distance transport occurs {{by way of the}} phloem; however, one report in the literature describes the presence of viroid RNA in the xylem ring of potato tubers. In this study, a modified method based on an EDTA-mediated phloem exudation technique was applied for detection of PSTVd in the phloem of infected tomato plants. RT-PCR, nucleic acid sequencing, and Southern blot analyses of RT-PCR products verified the presence of viroid RNA in phloem exudates. In addition, the guttation fluid collected from the leaves of PSTVd-infected tomato plants was analyzed revealing the absence of viroid RNA in the xylem sap. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PSTVd RNA detection in phloem exudates obtained by the EDTA-mediated exudation technique...|$|R
40|$|Viroids {{and most}} viral {{satellites}} have small, noncoding, and highly structured RNA genomes. How they cause disease symptoms without encoding proteins {{and why they}} have characteristic secondary structures are two longstanding questions. Recent {{studies have shown that}} both viroids and satellites are capable of inducing RNA silencing, suggesting a possible role of this mechanism in the pathology and evolution of these subviral RNAs. Here we show that preventing RNA silencing in tobacco, using a silencing suppressor, greatly reduces the symptoms caused by the Y satellite of cucumber mosaic virus. Furthermore, tomato plants expressing hairpin RNA, derived from <b>potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>viroid,</b> developed symptoms similar to those of <b>potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>viroid</b> infection. These results provide evidence suggesting that viroids and satellites cause disease symptoms by directing RNA silencing against physiologically important host genes. We also show that viroid and satellite RNAs are significantly resistant to RNA silencing-mediated degradation, suggesting that RNA silencing is an important selection pressure shaping the evolution of the secondary structures of these pathogens...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPotato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>viroid</b> (PSTVd) {{is a small}} non-protein-coding RNA {{pathogen}} {{that can}} induce disease symptoms {{in a variety of}} plant species. How PSTVd induces disease symptoms is a long standing question. It has been suggested that PSTVd-derived small RNAs (sRNAs) could direct RNA silencing of a targeted host gene(s) resulting in symptom development. To test this, we expressed PSTVd sequences as artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) in Nicotiana tabacum and Nicotiana benthamiana. One amiRNA, amiR 46 that corresponds to sequences within the PSTVd virulence modulating region (VMR), induced abnormal phenotypes in both Nicotiana species that closely resemble those displayed by PSTVd infected plants. In N. tabacum amiR 46 plants, phenotype severity correlated with amiR 46 accumulation and expression down-regulation of the bioinformatically-identified target gene, a Nicotiana soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase (siPPase). Taken together, our phenotypic and molecular analyses suggest that disease symptom development in Nicotiana species following PSTVd infection results from sRNA-directed RNA silencing of the host gene, siPPase...|$|R
40|$|Australian grapevine viroid (AGV, 369 residues) {{is a novel}} viroid {{with less}} than 50 % {{sequence}} similarity with any known viroid.

40|$|The {{complete}} {{nucleotide sequence}} of apple scar skin viroid(ASSV) has been established, and a probable secondary structure is proposed. A single-stranded circular ASSV RNA consists of 330 nucleotides and can assume the rodlike conformation with extensive base-pairing characteristic {{of all the}} known viroids. ASSV shows low sequence homologies with other viroids and lacks the central conserved region. These indicate that ASSV should be allocated to a separate viroid group. However, homologous sequences with <b>potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> viroid(PSTV) in ASSV occur in limited and scattered regions of both viroids. These homologous regions fall within the particular domains in the viroid domain model which has been previously proposed by Keese and Symons(Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} in vivo-labeled RNA {{to determine which}} of the two proposed rolling-circle models is more likely to depict the replication cycle of <b>potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>viroid.</b> A key feature distinguishing the two models is the presence of a circular monomeric minus strand in one and not the other. Chromatography on cellulose CF 11 was used to purify a fraction containing the replication intermediates free from single-stranded progeny. Heat denaturation followed by gel electrophoresis was used to seek possible circular templates—species required for rolling-circle replication to take place. Upon heating, a 32 P-labeled RNA was released. Limited nuclease digestion (“nicking”) revealed that this was a unitlength circular RNA. Fingerprinting identified it as a plus strand. No circular minus strands were detected in this population or in nuclease-treated samples containing RNase T 1 -resistant cores of the replication complex. Thus, <b>potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>viroid</b> appears to use an asymmetric pathway in which minus strands are synthesized by rolling-circle copying, but plus strands are not. More details of the replication pathways used by various viroid-like RNAs are needed and will help to establish the evolutionary relationships among these infectious agents...|$|E

The tertiary structure of these CCR transcripts was examined by UV-crosslinking of the RNA, followed by mapping of the crosslink using limited alkaline digestion and classical RNA secondary analysis. The CCR transcript was found to undergo UV-crosslinking between the same two bases as in full-length viroid, indicating that the tertiary structure is the same and that the CCR transcript will be useful for the affinity purification of host components...|$|R

Later, viroids were characterized as single stranded covalently closed circular RNA molecules occurring as highly base-paired rod-like structures. Viroids, together with viroid-like satellite RNAs have been officially endorsed by the International Committee for Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) as a novel order of subviral agents, which, in its 2014 publication, encompassed 2 families, 8 genera and 32 species.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPotato <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>viroid</b> (PSTVd) is {{believed}} to undergo a series of specific structural transitions during replication. The variable domain of PSTVd is known to contain sequences that are important for replication/accumulation {{as well as one}} of three “premelting regions” which control breakdown of the native structurein vitro. We have examined the structural and biological effects of five single and two double nucleotide substitutions within premelting region 3 in an effort to isolate temperature-sensitive mutations affecting PSTVd replication or pathogenesis. None of these mutants replicated as rapidly as the wild type, and a variety of spontaneous sequence changes were detected in their progeny. Higher temperatures were able to partially overcome the inhibition of replication associated with a more stable secondary structure, but no well-defined temperature-sensitive PSTVd mutants were identified. Selective pressures arising from the interaction of assay temperature and structural stabilityin vivoappear capable of moving PSTVd populations between peaks of relatively high fitness. Depending on the exact nature and location of the mutation, selection may occur at the level of either the plus or the minus strand...|$|R

The numbers of nucleotides of the RNA species varied between 246 and 670. The hydrodynamic models of rigid rods and flexible cylinders were applied for {{the interpretation of the}} sedimentation coefficients. Double-stranded RNA 5 from cucumber mosaic virus with 335 basepairs fits the model of a rigid rod with an hydrated diameter of 29 A. <b>Potato</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>viroid</b> and the four viroid-like RNA species of cadang-cadang-disease form a homologous series of flexible cylinders with a Kuhn's statistical length lambda- 1 of 600 A. The circular RNA from the two viruses mentioned above are more flexibel than the viroids and viroid-like RNAs. The hydrodynamic interpretation is in accordance with thermodynamic data and secondary structure models.

Complementary strand nucleic acids detected in extracts of infected plants were heterogeneous in size, with four discrete bands containing molecules approximately 700, 1050, 1500, and 1800 nucleotides long. Enzymatic studies indicated that these viroid minus strands are composed exclusively of RNA and, as extracted, are present in complexes containing extensive double-stranded regions.
