The reactivities of azide, acetohydroxamate, hydroperoxide, and 2 -iodosobenzoate ion nucleophiles exhibit modest a-effects when the reactivity in substitution at 4 -nitrophenyl acetate is {{compared with that}} of phenoxide ions of similar pK(a) values. The N,N-diethylhydroxylamine oxyanion is less reactive than its phenoxide ion analogue due to steric requirements, and the reactivities of the anionic nucleophiles exhibit changes in effective charge on the leaving oxygen similar to those for regular nucleophiles of similar pK(a).

The absence of buffer catalysis and of kinetic rate laws showing higher powers of amine concentration indicate that the breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate (the rate limiting step) does not require a second catalytic molecule. The reactivity per amino function against the phenyl esters is similar for each amino reagent, indicating that steric requirements of the microgel, which would be substantial due to its polymeric nature, are compensated by a catalytic function.

The 19 F NMR method was used to characterise the time-dependent conversion of various fluorinated acetophenones in either whole cells of Pseudomonas fluorescens ACB or in incubations with purified 4 '-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase (HAPMO). Whole cells of P. fluorescens ACB converted 4 '-fluoroacetophenone to 4 -fluorophenol and 4 '-fluoro- 2 '-hydroxyacetophenone to 4 -fluorocatechol without the accumulation of 4 '-fluorophenyl acetates. In contrast to 4 -fluorophenol, 4 -fluorocatechol was further degraded {{as evidenced by the}} formation of stoichiometric amounts of fluoride anion. Purified HAPMO catalysed the strictly NADPH-dependent conversion of fluorinated acetophenones to fluorophenyl acetates. Incubations with HAPMO at pH 6 and 8 showed that the enzymatic Baeyer-Villiger oxidation occurred faster at pH 8 but that the <b>phenyl</b> <b>acetates</b> produced were better stabilised at pH 6. Quantum mechanical characteristics explained why 4 '-fluoro- 2 '-hydroxyphenyl acetate was more sensitive to base-catalysed hydrolysis than 4 '-fluorophenyl acetate.

40|$|Second order {{kinetics}} of {{the reaction}} of polymer-attached hydroxamic acids with substituted <b>phenyl</b> <b>acetates</b> (k(pol)) have been measured in aqueous solution at 25 degrees C and shown to follow the following empirical rate law for degrees of ionisation (alpha) ranging from 0. 1 to 1 : k(pol) = a. alpha + b. e(-c/alpha). The slopes of the plots of k(pol) against alpha measures the reactivity of the polymer (k(react)) at given values of alpha and these increase as a is increased. The reactivity against substituted <b>phenyl</b> <b>acetates</b> at given alpha values increases with increasing cross-linking content of the microgel support. The reactivities at alpha = 0. 1 and 0. 9 obey the Bronsted equations: logk(react) (alpha = 0. 1) = - 0. 55 +/- 0. 065 pK(a) (ArOH) + 3. 26 +/- 0. 44 (n = 5; r = 0. 9799) logk(react) (alpha = 0. 9) = - 0. 37 +/- 0. 06 pK(a) (ArOH) + 3. 13 + 0. 43 (n = 5; r = 0. 9594) The similarity between the Bronsted beta values for the microgel-supported hydroxamate nucleophile at low degree of ionisation (alpha) and monomer hydroxamate ion {{is consistent with the}} microscopic medium of the transition-state's being water-like. At a high alpha value the less negative beta value indicates a smaller charge change in the transition state; this result and the effect of crosslinking on reactivity supports the hypothesis that the substantial reactivity increases are due to hydroxamate ions buried in the microgel particle and electrophilic assistance of nucleophilic attack.

In anesthesia, the soft drug is useful because it enables precise titration to effect and rapid recovery, which might allow swift and clear-headed recovery of consciousness and early home readiness. Propofol may cause delayed awakening after prolonged infusion. Propanidid and AZD 3043 have a different metabolic pathway compared to propofol, resulting in a short-acting clinical profile. Fluorine imparts a variety of properties to certain medicines, including an enhanced absorption rate and improved drug transport across the blood-brain barrier. We hypothesized that the introduction of fluorine to the frame structure of propanidid and AZD 3043 would further accelerate the swift and clear-headed recovery of consciousness.

Characterization of the purified enzyme {{showed that}} 4 -hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase (HAPMO) is a homodimer of ≈ 140 kDa with each subunit containing a noncovalently bound FAD molecule. HAPMO displays a tight coupling between NADPH oxidation and substrate oxygenation.

The HAPMO sequence contains several sequence motifs indicative for the presence of two Rossman fold domains involved in FAD and NADPH binding. The functional role of a recently identified flavoprotein sequence motif (ATG) was explored by site-directed mutagenesis.

The reactions of sulfonate esters only exhibit inhibition by the macrocyclic hosts. The reactions of the carboxylate esters exhibit catalysis and inhibition depending on the pH of the system.

The outline of the results obtained are summarized in the following: [...] (i) For this reaction comprising the heterogeneous reaction course between solid and liquid, the effect of stirring is regarded as an important factor and the gentle boiling of liquid phase had good results. (ii) The effective ranges for the quantities of mecruric oxide used at some definite conditions are inquired. For the fixed quantity of other reactants i. e. 0. 45 mol benzene and 1. 75 mol glacial acetic acid, 0. 05 [...] 1. 25 mol mercuric oxide are observed preferable quantities. Then, the optimum ranges are observed varying somewhat according to the other conditions, that is, effect of stirring and time of reaction. (iii) About 6 [...] 7 hours are recommended as the time of reaction. 酢酸フェニル水銀は農薬，殺菌剤及び防徹剤としての用途を有し諸所に於て製造されている。そしてその製造には所謂芳香族炭化水素の水銀化の反応と云われる環水素と水銀との置換反応が専ら用いられている。この水銀化の反応は，芳香族炭化水素の金属化反応の中の重要位置を占めるもので可成り興味深い故，この反応の研究の予備課程と云う意味も含めて，この小研究を行ったものである。酢酸フェニル水銀の生成法としては，古くからジフェニル水銀と氷酢酸との加熱による方法やベンゼンを乾燥した酢酸水銀と 110 ℃に長時間加熱する方法等が知られているが，製法として用いられているのは氷酢酸を含むエチルアルコールの存在で，ベンゼンと酢酸水銀とを煮沸する方法とベンゼン，氷酢酸及び酸化第二水銀（以下単に酸化水銀と記す）の三原料を混じて加熱反応させる方法とである。後者は次の(I) ，(II) 両式により前者は(II) 式のみによるものであるが，両者共(II) 式の水銀化反応による点は同じである。HgO + 2 CH_ 3 COOH [...] > Hg(OOCCH_ 3) _ 2 + H_ 2 O [...] -(I) C_ 6 H_ 6 + Hg(OOCCH_ 3) _ 2 [...] > C_ 6 H_ 5 Hg(OOCCH_ 3) + CH_ 3 COOH [...] (II) 本報に於ては後者即ち酸化水銀を用いる方法について，撹拌の有無，酸化水銀の使用量及び反応時間につきその収量や収率に及ぼす影響を調査した...|$|R
40|$|The bimolecular rate {{constants}} for {{reaction of}} imidazole with <b>phenyl</b> <b>acetates</b> complexed with {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) micelles obey Bronsted equations with beta(1 g) {{similar to that of}} the reaction in aqueous solution. The dissociation constants of ester (Ks) and the hypothetical dissociation constant (K-TS) Of the transition state of the micelle complexes obey Hansch equations with similar sensitivities (p) to pi(- 0. 66 and - 0. 589 for K-S and - 0. 735 and - 0. 495 for K-TS, respectively). The slopes also indicate that the microsolvation environments associated with the transition state and the complexed ester have aqueous character. The relative values of K-TS and K-S indicate that the transition state of the reaction of imidazole with ester is more weakly complexed to both micelles than is the reactant ester. Log K-TS values are linear functions of log K-S for reactions with both CTAB and SDS; the slopes are, respectively, - 0. 893 and - 1. 19 consistent with a slightly more "water-like" medium for the transition state than for the site of binding of ester with CTAB-micelle and slightly less for the SDS-micelle. The results for ester and transition state are consistent with the location of the phenyl residue in a hydrophobic region that possesses water molecules. It is concluded that the acetyl group in the complexed transition state is located in an aqueous part of the Stern region, whereas the phenyl residue is in a part of the Stern region that possesses alkane components. The derived kinetic and complexation parameters in these experiments refer to micelles with Stern regions that have been maintained at constant ionic compositions...|$|R
