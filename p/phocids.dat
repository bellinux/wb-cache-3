5|$|The walrus's {{body shape}} shares {{features}} with both sea lions (eared seals: Otariidae) and seals (true seals: Phocidae). As with otariids, it can turn its rear flippers forward {{and move on}} all fours; however, its swimming technique is more like that of true seals, relying less on flippers and more on sinuous whole body movements. Also like <b>phocids,</b> it lacks external ears.|$|E
5|$|Almost all {{pinnipeds}} have fur coats, {{the exception}} being the walrus, {{which is only}} sparsely covered. Even some fully furred species (particularly sea lions) are less haired than most land mammals. In species that live on ice, young pups have thicker coats than adults. The individual hairs on the coat, known collectively as lanugo, can trap heat from sunlight and keep the pup warm. Pinnipeds are typically countershaded, and are darker colored dorsally and lighter colored ventrally, which serves to eliminate shadows caused by light shining over the ocean water. The pure white fur of harp seal pups conceals them in their Arctic environment. Some species, such as ribbon seals, ringed seals and leopard seals, have patterns of contrasting light and dark coloration. All fully furred species molt; <b>phocids</b> molt once a year, while otariids gradually molt all year. Seals have a layer of subcutaneous fat known as blubber that is particularly thick in <b>phocids</b> and walruses. Blubber serves both to keep the animals warm and to provide energy and nourishment when they are fasting. It can constitute as much as 50% of a pinniped's body weight. Pups are born with only {{a thin layer of}} blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E

However, of the 35 harbour seals receiving this vaccine upon admission to a seal rehabilitation and research centre (Pieterburen, The Netherlands) in 1989, six developed mild inflammatory symptoms of the respiratory tract. <b>Phocid</b> distemper virus- 1 (PDV- 1) could be isolated from three of these animals. This indicates that the vaccine affords protection from <b>phocid</b> distemper, but may still allow PDV- 1 infection of the respiratory tract.

5|$|Pinnipeds {{themselves}} {{are subject to}} predation. Most species are preyed on by the killer whale or orca. To subdue and kill seals, orcas continuously ram them with their heads, slap them with their tails and fling them in the air. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer whales, but they are occasionally hunted by larger groups or by lone individuals. Pups are more commonly taken by orcas, but adults can be targeted as well. Large sharks are another major predator of pinnipeds—usually the great white shark but also the tiger shark and mako shark. Sharks usually attack by ambushing them from below. The prey usually escapes, and seals are often seen with shark-inflicted wounds. Otariids typically have injuries in the hindquarters, while <b>phocids</b> usually have injuries on the forequarters.|$|E
5|$|For otariids {{and some}} <b>phocids</b> like the harbor seal, mothers fast and nurse their pups {{for a few}} days at a time. In between nursing bouts, the females leave their young onshore to forage at sea. These {{foraging}} trips may last anywhere between a day and two weeks, depending on the abundance of food and the distance of foraging sites. While their mothers are away, the pups will fast. Lactation in otariids may last 6–11 months; in the Galápagos fur seal it can last as long as 3 years. Pups of these species are weaned at lower weights than their phocid counterparts. Walruses are unique in that mothers nurse their young at sea. The female rests at the surface with its head held up, and the young suckle upside down. Young pinnipeds typically learn to swim on their own and some species can even swim at birth. Other species may wait days or weeks before entering the water. Elephant seals do not swim until weeks after they are weaned.|$|E
5|$|One popular {{hypothesis}} {{suggested that}} pinnipeds are diphyletic (descended from two ancestral lines), with walruses and otariids sharing a recent common ancestor with bears and <b>phocids</b> sharing one with Musteloidea. However, morphological and molecular evidence support a monophyletic origin. Nevertheless, {{there is some}} dispute as to whether pinnipeds are {{more closely related to}} bears or musteloids, as some studies support the former theory and others the latter. Pinnipeds split from other caniforms 50 million years ago (mya) during the Eocene. Their evolutionary link to terrestrial mammals was unknown until the 2007 discovery of Puijila darwini in early Miocene deposits in Nunavut, Canada. Like a modern otter, Puijila had a long tail, short limbs and webbed feet instead of flippers. However, its limbs and shoulders were more robust and Puijila likely had been a quadrupedal swimmer–retaining a form of aquatic locomotion that give rise to the major swimming types employed by modern pinnipeds. The researchers who found Puijila placed it in a clade with Potamotherium (traditionally considered a mustelid) and Enaliarctos. Of the three, Puijila was the least specialized for aquatic life. The discovery of Puijila in a lake deposit suggests that pinniped evolution went through a freshwater transitional phase.|$|E

5|$|Other seals, {{like the}} walrus and most <b>phocids,</b> breed on ice with {{copulation}} usually {{taking place in}} the water (a few land-breeding species also mate in water). Females of these species tend to aggregate less. In addition, since ice is less stable than solid land, breeding sites change location each year, and males are unable to predict where females will stay during the breeding season. Hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, where females form dense aggregations perhaps due to their patchy food sources. Pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on pack ice. Some of these species are serially monogamous, including the harp seal, crabeater seal and hooded seal. Seals that breed on ice tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly longer than males. Walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.|$|E
5|$|<b>Phocids</b> {{are known}} to have existed for at least 15 million years, and {{molecular}} evidence supports a divergence of the Monachinae and Phocinae lineages 22mya. The fossil monachine Monotherium and phocine Leptophoca were found in southeastern North America. The deep split between the lineages of Erignathus and Cystophora 17mya suggests that the phocines migrated eastward and northward from the North Atlantic. The genera Phoca and Pusa could have arisen when a phocine lineage traveled from the Paratethys Sea to the Arctic Basin and subsequently went eastward. The ancestor of the Baikal seal migrated into Lake Baikal from the Arctic (via the Siberian ice sheet) and became isolated there. The Caspian seal's ancestor became isolated as the Paratethys shrank, leaving the animal in a small remnant sea, the Caspian Sea. The monochines diversified southward. Monachus emerged in the Mediterranean and migrated to the Caribbean and then the central North Pacific. The two extant elephant seal species diverged close to 4mya after the Panamanian isthmus was formed. The lobodontine lineage emerged around 9mya and colonized the southern ocean in response to glaciation.|$|E
5|$|The main {{adaptations of}} the {{pinniped}} circulatory system for diving are the enlargement and increased complexity of veins {{to increase their}} capacity. Retia mirabilia form blocks of tissue on the inner wall of the thoracic cavity and the body periphery. These tissue masses, which contain extensive contorted spirals of arteries and thin-walled veins, act as blood reservoirs that increase oxygen stores for use during diving. As with other diving mammals, pinnipeds have high amounts of hemoglobin and myoglobin stored in their blood and muscles. This allows them to stay submerged {{for long periods of}} time while still having enough oxygen. Deep-diving species such as elephant seals have blood volumes that make up to 20% of their body weight. When diving, they reduce their heart rate and maintain blood flow only to the heart, brain and lungs. To keep their blood pressure stable, <b>phocids</b> have an elastic aorta that dissipates some energy of each heartbeat.|$|E

Sera from wild hooded seals (Cystophora cristata), harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandica), and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) were positive for antibodies to PhoHV- 1 antigenically related herpesvirus antigens at 73 %, 79 %, and 96 %, respectively. We isolated new herpesviruses in cell culture from two hunter-harvested ringed seals (Pusa hispida) in poor body condition from Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories, Canada; one lethargic hooded seal from the St. Lawrence Estuary, Québec, Canada; and one captive, asymptomatic harp seal from the Magdalen Islands, Québec. Partial sequencing of the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene revealed that all four virus isolates were closely related to PhoHV- 2, {{a member of the}} Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily, with nucleotide similarity ranging between 92. 8 % and 95. 3 %.

40|$|The neuropeptide hormone {{oxytocin}} {{plays an}} integral role in mammalian reproductive endocrinology and behaviour. It has been utilised {{to study the}} physiological factors driving maternal behaviour in both laboratory and domestic mammals, but few studies have successfully detected oxytocin in wild individuals, or linked detected concentrations to the behaviours they exhibit. <b>Phocid</b> seals present an excellent system in which to study oxytocin’s effects on maternal behaviour in the wild. The energetic constraints placed on a <b>phocid</b> mother during the dependant period should cause strong selection pressure for behaviour that maximises reproductive success with the least cost to the mother. However in many <b>phocid</b> species, substantial variations in maternal behaviour persist. In order to investigate whether oxytocin {{plays a role in}} driving this variation, behavioural and hormonal datasets were collected from grey seal mothers and pups on two breeding colonies in Scotland. A protocol for the detection of plasma oxytocin in <b>phocid</b> seals was successfully developed, along with the methodology to manipulate peripheral oxytocin concentrations to directly test the hormone’s impact on behaviour. Both correlatory studies on natural oxytocin concentrations and behaviour in wild mother-pup pairs and manipulation experiments on newly weaned pups show that plasma oxytocin concentrations influence behaviours that makes mother – pup separation less likely. These include increasing the time spent in close proximity to each other, increasing the number of checks performed on the pup and reducing the aggressive behaviour directed towards the other individual. Additionally, plasma oxytocin could be used as an indicator of weak maternal bonds between mother and pup, which resulted in behaviours such as abandonment and fostering. This study highlights the potential of oxytocin for studying variations in behaviours critical to an individual’s reproductive success and provides the methodological framework for studies on other wild species to be conducted in the future...|$|R
5|$|The walrus is a mammal in {{the order}} Carnivora.

40|$|Lactation is {{the most}} energetically {{expensive}} period for female mammals and is associated {{with some of the}} highest sustained metabolic rates (SusMR) in vertebrates (reported as total energy throughput). Females typically deal with this energy demand by increasing food intake and the structure of the alimentary tract may act as the central constraint to ceilings on SusMR at about seven times resting or standard metabolic rate (SMR). However, demands of lactation may also be met by using a form of metabolic compensation such as reducing locomotor activities or entering torpor. In some <b>phocid</b> seals, cetaceans and bears, females fast throughout lactation and thus cannot offset the high energetic costs of lactation through increased food intake. We demonstrate that fasting grey seal females sustain, for several weeks, one of the highest total daily energy expenditures (DEE; 7. 4 x SMR) reported in mammals, while progressively reducing maintenance metabolic expenditures during lactation through means not explained by reduction in lean body mass or behavioural changes. Simultaneously, the energy-exported in milk is progressively increased, associated with increased lipoprotein lipase activity in the mammary gland, resulting in greater offspring growth. Our results suggest that females use compensatory mechanisms to help meet the extraordinary energetic costs of lactation. Additionally, although the concepts of SusMR and ceilings on total DEE may be somewhat different in fasting lactating species, our data on <b>phocid</b> seals demonstrate that metabolic ceilings on milk energy output, in general, are not constrained by the same kind of peripheral limitations as are other energy-consuming tissues. In <b>phocid</b> seals, the high ceilings on DEE during lactation, coupled with metabolic compensation, are undoubtedly important factors enabling shortened lactation...|$|R
40|$|Murine {{monoclonal}} antibodies (MAbs) {{were generated}} against <b>phocid</b> herpesviruses (PhHV 2557 /Han 88 and 7848 /Han 90) isolated from European harbour seals (Phoca vitulina), and against strains of both felid (FHV strain FVR 605) and canid herpesviruses (CHV isolate 5105 /Han 89). MAbs were characterized {{with respect to}} certain biological properties and used to outline antigenicity profiles of isolates of PhHV (n = 8), FHV (n = 7) and CHV (n = 3) in enzyme immunoassays employing fixed infected cells. A close antigenic relationship between herpesviruses derived from pinnipeds and terrestrial carnivores became evident: The majority of the MAbs was directed against epitopes which were expressed by {{at least two of}} the viral species tested. A number of MAbs detected epitopes which were conserved between all isolates of PhHV, FHV and CHV. A few MAbs recognized type-specific B-cell epitopes and facilitated the identification of single viral species. Moreover, the PhHV isolate 7848 /Han 90 was antigenically distinguishable both from seven other <b>phocid</b> herpesvirus isolates and from FHV or CHV. PhHV 7848 /Han 90 proved to be antigenically distinct from all other viruses tested when examined by cross neutralization utilizing various reconvalescent and hyperimmune sera. Although more data are needed to ensure that PhHV 7848 /Han 90 indeed is a new genuine seal herpesvirus, the preliminary clustering of two groups of <b>phocid</b> herpesvirus isolates, tentatively designated PhHV- 1 (type isolate 2557 /Han 88) and PhHV- 2 (represented by 7848 /Han 90), seems to be justified. By using selected MAbs an unambiguous identification and typing of herpesvirus isolates derived from marine mammals and terrestrial carnivores is significantly facilitated...|$|R
50|$|<b>Phocid</b> {{respiratory}} and circulatory {{systems are}} adapted to allow diving to considerable depths, {{and they can}} spend a long time underwater between breaths. Air is forced from the lungs during a dive and into the upper respiratory passages, where gases cannot easily be absorbed into the bloodstream. This helps protect the seal from the bends. The middle ear is also lined with blood sinuses that inflate during diving, helping to maintain a constant pressure.|$|R
