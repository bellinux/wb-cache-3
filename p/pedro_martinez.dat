5|$|The lone {{bright spot}} for the Red Sox came in Game 3 at Boston's Fenway Park, in {{what had been a}} much {{anticipated}} pitching match-up of former Red Sox star Roger Clemens, who was now pitching for the Yankees, and Boston ace <b>Pedro</b> <b>Martínez.</b> Martínez struck out twelve and did not allow a run through seven innings of work; Clemens was hit hard, giving up five earned runs and only lasting two innings of a 13–1 Red Sox victory. The Yankees rebounded to win Games 4 and 5, clinching the American League pennant and advancing to the Series, where they swept the Atlanta Braves, (including two 8th-inning comebacks). The loss to <b>Pedro</b> <b>Martínez</b> was the Yankees' only postseason loss, as the team went 11–1.|$|E

5|$|The Red Sox {{had lost}} in the {{previous}} season's American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees. The loss was mainly blamed on the decision by then-manager Grady Little to keep starting pitcher <b>Pedro</b> <b>Martínez</b> in {{the game in the}} 8th inning of Game 7, and Little was fired two weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Bautista throws three pitches: a fastball, a curveball, and a changeup. His fastball {{travels in}} the high 90mph range. His curve can break down sharply, and he learned the changeup from <b>Pedro</b> <b>Martínez.</b> Wildness had {{been a problem for}} Bautista {{throughout}} his career. He has trouble controlling his fastball and walks a great deal of hitters, which has often contributed to his departure from teams.|$|E

5|$|Koufax was {{the first}} major league pitcher to pitch four no-hitters and the eighth pitcher to pitch a perfect game in {{baseball}} history. Despite his comparatively short career, Koufax's 2,396 career strikeouts ranked 7th in history as of his retirement, trailing only Warren Spahn (2,583) among left-handers. Koufax, Randy Johnson, <b>Pedro</b> <b>Martínez,</b> and Nolan Ryan are the only four pitchers elected to the Hall of Fame who had more strikeouts than innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, Phillies scouts {{evaluated}} pitcher <b>Pedro</b> <b>Martínez</b> in two simulated {{games against}} the Phillies DSL team, leading to a one-year, $1-million contract. Replacing Jamie Moyer as a starter in the Phillies rotation on August 12, 2009, Philadelphia won each of Martínez's first seven starts, {{the first time in}} franchise history that this had occurred with any debuting Phillies pitcher. The Phillies made one large acquisition at the trade deadline, trading four minor league players to the Cleveland Indians for pitcher Cliff Lee and outfielder Ben Francisco. Lee won seven of his twelve regular season starts for Philadelphia in 2009.|$|E
5|$|On September 10, 1999, Chili Davis' second-inning {{home run}} {{was the only}} hit by the Yankees against <b>Pedro</b> <b>Martínez,</b> who struck out 17 Yankees—the most strikeouts against a Yankee team ever. Martínez retired the last 22 batters after giving up the home run, {{including}} striking out eight of the final nine batters. The teams finished first and second in their division and both made the playoffs in the same season. This led to the very first post-season meeting in the longtime rivalry.|$|E

Durbin allowed a ground rule double to Jeter, who advanced to third on a sacrifice bunt by Hairston and scored on a single by Mark Teixeira. Durbin then hit Rodriguez with a pitch and was relieved by J.A. Happ after recording just one out. Happ allowed a two-run double to Matsui, his fifth and sixth RBI of the game, which tied a World Series record for most RBI in a single game set by Bobby Richardson in the 1960 World Series.|$|E
5|$|Bautista grew up {{receiving}} {{instruction on}} pitching from his second cousin, <b>Pedro</b> <b>Martínez.</b> The Florida Marlins signed him in 2000 but traded {{him to the}} Baltimore Orioles before Bautista reached the major leagues.

Bautista was ranked Kansas City's number two prospect by Baseball America entering the 2005 season, but he made just seven starts before missing {{the rest of the}} season with an injury. He posted a 5.66 earned run average (ERA) for the Royals in 2006 before getting traded to the Colorado Rockies. He appeared in nine games (all in relief) for the Rockies in 2007, spending most of the year in the minor leagues.|$|E

The Yankees beat the Angels and went on defeat the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2009 World Series, 4–2, to earn their 27th World Series title and their first championship {{in their first year}} in the new Yankee Stadium.

July was the team's best showing of the season, as they compiled their first 20-win month since the 2001 season. The Phillies traded for starting pitcher Cliff Lee {{at the end of}} the month to bolster their starting rotation, who won his first five starts with the team, and signed free-agent pitcher <b>Pedro</b> <b>Martínez.</b> In August, Eric Bruntlett turned the first game-ending unassisted triple play in National League history, and the second in team history. The following month, the team clinched its third consecutive division championship on September 30, becoming the first Phillies team to make a third straight playoff appearance since the 1976–1978 Phillies.|$|E
