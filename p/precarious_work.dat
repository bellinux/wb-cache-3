After the April 2006 cancellation of the First Employment Contract, unions have increased pressure to cancel this contract; they contend that it creates <b>precarious</b> <b>work</b> for employees, endangering job security.|$|E
25|$|Delegates {{discussed}} the capitalist economic crisis, imperialist intervention and war globally, environmental crisis and climate change, {{the intensification of}} the attack on organized labour, youth unemployment/underemployment and <b>precarious</b> <b>work,</b> poverty wages, ableism, xenophobia and racism, the ongoing genocidal attack on Indigenous peoples, sexism, transphobia and homophobia, and the struggle for free, accessible, quality public education at all-levels. Throughout this analysis it was made clear that what connects these struggles is their relation to the struggle against capitalism, and particularly the struggle against monopoly capital and their governments. At the Pan-Canadian level this means the struggle against the Harper Conservative government which represents a consolidation of the anti-social offensive of capital.|$|E

2500|$|Women often {{participate}} in the workforce in <b>precarious</b> <b>work,</b> including export-oriented employment.

2500|$|Beyond the Equality Act 2010 three EU Directives, and UK Regulations, require minimum {{levels of}} equal {{treatment}} {{for people with}} part-time, fixed-term or agency work contracts, compared to people with more permanent or full-time jobs. Many people choose atypical work patterns to balance family or social commitments, but many are also in <b>precarious</b> <b>work,</b> where they lack the bargaining power to get better terms. However, the requirements for equal treatment are not uniform, and are often limited. The Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 state that a part-time worker cannot be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time worker. However (like for age) an employer may objectively justify less favourable treatment for both direct and indirect discrimination. Moreover, (similar to equal pay rules) under regulation 2(4) a worker can only compare themselves to real full-time workers who work under the [...] "same type of contract" [...] doing [...] "broadly similar work", and {{are in the same}} establishment, or under a common collective agreement. In Matthews v Kent and Medway Fire Authority, the House of Lords held that even though part-time firefighters did not do administrative work, their contracts were still broadly similar to the full-time firefighters. In O'Brien v Ministry of Justice the Supreme Court also rejected that giving part-time judges no pension pro rata was unlawful, and had no objective justification. Although the Ministry argued that it was legitimate to save money, and to recruit quality full-time judges with a pension, Lord Hope and Lady Hale emphasised that budgetary considerations are not relevant, and it was necessary to recruit good part-time staff also. But although rights are strong in law to counteract people being treated differently in the same workplace, part-time workers across the UK economy remain underpaid compared to full-time workers as a whole. Workplaces tend to be structurally segregated, so many jobs, often where women are working, are all part-time while better paying jobs tend to be full-time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Precarious</b> <b>work</b> is {{non-standard}} employment that is poorly paid, insecure, unprotected, and cannot support a household. In recent decades {{there has been}} a dramatic increase in <b>precarious</b> <b>work</b> due to such factors as globalization, the shift from the manufacturing sector to the service sector, and the spread of information technology. These changes have created a new economy which demands flexibility in the workplace and, as a result, caused the decline of the standard employment relationship and a dramatic increase in <b>precarious</b> <b>work.</b> An important aspect of <b>precarious</b> <b>work</b> is its gendered nature, as women are continuously over-represented in this type of work.|$|E
40|$|This article {{argues that}} humour can provide {{researchers}} {{with a unique}} access point into the professional cultures of media producers. By reconsidering an earlier case study, and reviewing relevant literature, it illustrates how humour can fulfil several functions in media production. Importantly, humour is a central means of performing the ‘emotional labour’ that increasingly <b>precarious</b> media <b>work</b> demands. For production research, the everyday joking and banter of media workers can provide an important and, heretofore, overlooked means of accessing culture, meaning, consensus and conflict in media organizations. The article argues that humour’s organizational role {{should be considered as}} a sensitizing concept when designing production research...|$|R

A major focus is how those who follow their art by way of “portfolio” work handle their rights in ways that diverge significantly from the current simplistic assumptions of law and cultural policy. Our conclusions underline the distance between present top-down conceptions of what drives production in the cultural field and the actual practice of dancers and musicians...|$|R

Orthodox reforms in both countries paradoxically facilitated market failures given the forms or modes taken by foreign direct investment (FDI), which introduced ever more increasing scale economies with their attendant information imperfections. In addition, the growing competition from tradeable goods faced by domestic producers in both countries and the decision to buy rather than make technologies by way of FDI undermined job creation and induced inter-sectoral flows toward service sector and informal work. ...|$|R

Drawing on the findings of a case study of how performers manage care and <b>precarious</b> paid <b>work</b> in film, television and theatre production in Australia, this article provides a context in which work and care regimes can be analysed. Individualised negotiations with agents and producers are buttressed by individualised arrangements with family and extended networks to accommodate complex and changing needs.
