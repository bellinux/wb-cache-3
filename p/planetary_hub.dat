40|$|In the {{bachelor}} thesis, the drivetrain {{design of the}} racing car is solved and described. The competition rules are summarized in the introduction. Then the driving resistances and drivetrain design variants are evaluated, which main objective is to achieve low fuel consumption. The solution {{is focused on the}} concept of a <b>planetary</b> gear-shifting <b>hub,</b> in combination with the synchronous belt drive. The Honda GX 25 engine with a centrifugal clutch and the driven wheel dimension of 20 ” is used to drive the design. The design solution is shown at the assembly drawing...|$|R

Full details of this licence are available at: [URL] efficiency and refinement of <b>planetary</b> wheel <b>hub</b> gearing system are key design attributes for heavy and off-highway vehicles. Reduction of power loss, directly leading {{to the development of}} new generation ECO-axles requires analysis of gear contacting conditions for lubricated conjunctions to determine frictional performance. This is also affected by gear dynamics which is a prerequisite for assessment of NVH performance. Therefore, a combined tribo-dynamic analysis is essential. There is a dearth of such holistic analysis, particularly for the case of wheel <b>hub</b> <b>planetary</b> systems. The paper presents such an analysis, which thus far not reported. The inexorable interplay of transmission efficiency and NVH refinement is shown. The key attributes of NVH refinement and transmission efficiency can pose contrary requirements and near-optimal conditions can be highlighted by mesh phasing of gearing contacts, thus alleviating the need for more complex gear teeth modifications entailing prohibitive manufacturing costs...|$|R
50|$|The {{main gearbox}} {{contains}} five speed forward of which all are synchronised and one reverse gear. In addition, {{the vehicle is}} equipped with a two-step reduction gear. Both axles are driven and equipped with <b>planetary</b> <b>hub</b> reduction and differential locks. The front axle drive engagement works pneumatically and can be used during driving. Suspension is carried out with leaf springs, the front axle has got also shock absorbers. The service brakes are air operated and the hand brake works by releasing of the air pressure.|$|E
50|$|The chassis is a {{full-length}} backbone tube with independent swing half axles in 4x4, 6x6 and 8x8. 4x4 models had front axle suspension via adjustable torsion bars, 6x6 and 8x8 models {{front and rear}} axles used longitudinal semi-elliptic leaf springs. For 4x4 configuration the rear axle was suspended via air suspension. Full-time all-wheel-drive front twin steer (6x6, 8x8) drive via homo-kinetic drive shafts, drive with the differential locks, inter-axle differentials with locks and <b>planetary</b> <b>hub</b> reductions on all models. Unlike many six-wheeled vehicles, which have a single front axle and tandem rear axles, 6x6 versions used twin steering front axles- as with the 8x8- and a single rear axle.|$|E
50|$|The {{main gearbox}} was located behind {{the cabin and}} {{connected}} to the engine clutch housing via a short cardan shaft (this design enables a so-called flat floor cabin.) The main gearbox was bolted to an auxiliary gearbox, to a transfer case {{and then to a}} backbone tube and formed main part of a chassis structure. Options for the rear power take off and or a winch drive were available. Main and auxiliary gears were fully synchronized except the first and reverse gear. The new feature was unique 2-speed planetary overdrive system bolted between front and rear axles.The overdrive could only be selected manually whilst stationary. Auxiliary gearbox had a neutral position which allowed a winch and a power take off to use main gearbox gearing for variable speed operation. The final drives used Tatra gear differentials with locks, offset drive shafts and <b>planetary</b> <b>hub</b> reductions.|$|E
50|$|The average male {{polar bear}} is 8 to 10 feet (2.5 to 3 meters) tall when {{standing}} {{on its hind}} legs. The tires on each Tundra Buggy vehicle are 5.5 feet (1.7 meters) high and 3.6 feet (1.1 meters) wide, and sit on 25-inch rims. A wide-bodied enclosure sits {{on top of the}} wheels and provides even more height, security, comfort and ability for guests to move around to view and photograph wildlife. The engine in Tundra Buggies is an International DT 466, often found in highway semi-trailers. It is geared through the Allison Transmission, and then geared through the differentials and <b>planetaries</b> on the <b>hubs.</b> The buggies are full-time four-wheel drive and have the capability to lock the differentials if needed.|$|R
40|$|Pitting {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of failure in {{planetary}} gear sets of axles designed for agricultural vehicles. The high torque and the low wheel speed typical of such machines result in poor lubrication and promote the onset of contact fatigue failure by pitting, which generally occurs earlier in the sun gear than in both the planets and the ring of wheel <b>hub</b> <b>planetary</b> drives. In fact, sun gears are subjected to the highest contact pressure and, at the same time, unfavourable rolling-sliding working conditions. In this paper, six case hardened sun gears damaged by pitting during endurance tests were analysed. The aim of the analysis was to highlight the key aspects of the morphology and the evolution of pitting damage on the case hardened sun gears...|$|R

The paper studies the effect of tooth crowning and tip relief upon system efficiency. It includes an analytical elastohydrodynamic analysis of elliptical point contact of crowned spur gear teeth. The analysis also includes the effect of direct contact of asperities on the opposing meshing surfaces. Tooth contact analysis (TCA) is used to obtain the contact footprint shape as well as contact kinematics and load distribution.
