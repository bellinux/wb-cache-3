We previously reported that the bioavailability of CoQ 10 powder was less than 10 %. In this study, we investigated various preparations to improve the intestinal absorption of CoQ 10 with focus {{on the effect of}} emulsification. We prepared a suspension and some emulsions with four types of surfactants and investigated the plasma concentration profile after oral administration to rats. The absorption of CoQ 10 was improved by an emulsion formulation although there was little absorption of CoQ 10 when a suspension was administered. However, little CoQ 10 was absorbed in the bile duct-ligated group even when the emulsion formulation was administered (about 50 % of the control group). Bile and emulsion formulation are essential for absorption of CoQ 10. When the preparations containing Tween <b>20</b> (polysorbate (<b>20)</b> <b>sorbitan</b> monolaurate) and Tween 80 (<b>polyoxyethylene</b> (<b>20)</b> <b>sorbitan</b> monooleate) were administered, plasma concentrations of CoQ 10 were higher than those obtained with preparations containing Tween 65 (<b>polyoxyethylene</b> (<b>20)</b> <b>sorbitan</b> tristearate) and Span <b>20</b> (<b>sorbitan</b> monolaurate).

As clays are primarily silicates, the question arises "Why not apply the same principles to enhance porosity characteristics of other silicates such as clays?"

Synthesis of Laponite-like compounds within the laboratory led to enhancement of porosity characteristics without templating; a total pore volume of 0. 44 cm 3 g- 1 was observed for this synthetic hectorite (KP). Use of a template further enhanced the porosity characteristics of these samples.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] cell membrane emulsification was used to create double water-in-oil-in-water emulsions at the dispersed phase flux of up to 3200 L m− 2 h− 1. The oil phase was unrefined pumpkin seed oil or sunflower oil containing 30 % by volume of internal water phase and the external water phase was 2 % Tween <b>20</b> (<b>polyoxyethylene</b> <b>sorbitan</b> monolaurate) or 2 % Pluronic F- 68 (polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylen copolymer). Using microengineered nickel membranes with pore sizes between 15 and 40 μm, median drop sizes of double emulsion droplets were in the range between 100 and 430 μm, depending mainly on the shear at the membrane surface and dispersed phase injection rate. In most cases the drops were very uniform, with span (i. e. 90 % drop size minus 10 % drop size divided by median size) values of around 0. 5. This data is similar to what was obtained previously for simple O/W emulsions of the same materials. Hence, the internal water phase, and internal surfactant, 5 % PGPR (polyglycerol polyricinoleate), did not adversely influence the emulsification process. A marker material, copper sulfate, was added to the internal water phase and the release of copper was monitored with respect to time. For both lipid systems, at the larger droplet size, there was a significant period of no copper release, followed by almost linear release with time. This initial period was absent when the drop size was close to 100 μm. The initial entrapment efficiency of the copper, in all experiments, was higher than 94 %...|$|R
40|$|It is {{possible}} to obtain finely dispersed growth of tubercle bacilli by adding to the media {{in which they are}} cultivated certain non-ionic wetting agents. The polyoxyethylene esters of oleic acid (Atlas G- 2144), lauric acid (Arias G- 2124), sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80), sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60), <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate</b> (Tween 40), and <b>sorbitan</b> monolaurate (Tween <b>20),</b> have proven especially effective in this respect. In addition to their wetting effect on the cell, certain of the water-dispersible esters just mentioned are capable of enhancing the growth of many strains of tubercle bacilli, probably by supplying them with long chain fatty acids in a non-toxic form available for metabolic utilization (3). Unfortunately, the ester linkage in these wetting agents is susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis by lipases, a fact which prohibits their use in media containing animal tissues or fluids rich in these enzymes. It is therefore desirable to find other types of wetting agents capable of promoting dispersed growth of tubercle bacilli and stable in the presence of animal tissues.

40|$|Purpose. This study {{examines}} the microstructure, gelation tempera-tures, and flow properties of novel amphiphilogels consisting solely of non-ionic surfactants. Methods. Gels were prepared by mixing the solid gelator (sorbitan monostearate or <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate)</b> and the liquid phase (liq-uid sorbitan esters or polysorbates) and heating them at 60 °C {{to form a}} clear isotropic sol phase, and cooling the sol phase to form an opaque semisolid at room temperature. Gel microstructure was ex-amined by light and electron microscopy and by small angle neutron scattering (SANS); gelation temperatures were measured by hot-stage microscopy, a melting point apparatus, and high sensitivity dif-ferential scanning calorimetry (HSDSC). Flow rheograms were per-formed to establish the zero-rate viscosity of the gels and their per-formance under shear. Results. Gel microstructures consisted mainly of clusters of tubules of gelator molecules that had aggregated upon cooling of the sol phase, forming a 3 D network throughout the continuous phase. The gels demonstrated thermoreversibility. Gelation temperature and viscos-ity increased with increasing gelator concentration, indicating a more robust gel network. At temperatures near the skin surface tempera-ture, the gels softened considerably; this would allow topical appli-cation. Conclusions. This study has demonstrated the formation/preparation of stable, thermoreversible, thixtropic surfactant gels (amphiphilo-gels) with suitable physical properties for topical use.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of four surfactants at the silica-toluene interface {{have been}} investigated by Fourier-transform infrared - attenuated total reflection (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy. Specifically, hexadecylamine, 1, 12 -diaminododecane, didecylamine and <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate</b> were studied. The silica surface for the spectroscopic experiments {{was provided by the}} native oxide layer on a silicon ATR prism. In order to study the CH(_ 2) stretching vibrations, the solvent was fully deuterated. Careful calibration of the ATR experiment enabled the contribution to the ATR spectrum made by adsorbed species to be calculated. The surface excess concentration of the amines were calculated over a range of bulk solution conentrations, enabling adsorption isotherms to be constructed. The use of polarized radiation allowed the orientation of the molecules within the adsorbed layer to be studied. The adsorbed layer of hexadecylamine showed some ordering of the aliphatic chains. There is some spectral evidence that the chains in the adsorbed layer of 1, 12 - diaminododecane adopt a 'looped' configuration. The effect of adsorbed layers of the molecules listed above upon the rheological behaviour of Aerosil 200 dispersions in toluene was investigated. Differences in the rheological behaviour of these dispersions have been correlated to differences in adsorbed layer structure as determined by FTIR-ATR. Due to differences in the Aerosil and ATR surface these correlations must be treated cautiously...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Hydroxyapatite (HAP) {{microspheres}} with peculiar spheres-in-sphere morphology {{were prepared}} by using oil- n-water emulsions and solvent evaporation technique. Ethylene vinyl acetate co-polymer (EVA) {{was used as}} the binder material. Preparation of HAP/EVA microspheres was followed by the thermal de-binding and sintering at 1150 °C for 3 h to obtain HAP microspheres. Each microsphere of 100 – 1000 mm was in turn composed of spherical hydroxyapatite granules of 2 – 15 mm size which were obtained by spray drying the precipitated HAP. The parameters such as percentage of initial HAP loading, type of stabilizer, concentration of stabilizer, stirring speed and temperature of microsphere preparation were varied to study their effect on the particle size and geometry of the microspheres obtained. It was observed that these parameters do {{have an effect on the}} size and shape of the microspheres obtained, which in turn will affect the sintered HAP micro-structure. Of the three stabilizers used viz. polyoxyethylene(20) <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate</b> (Tween- 40), sodium laurate and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), only PVA with a concentration not less than 0 × 1 wt % showed controlled stabilization of HAP granules resulting in spherical microspheres of required size. Morphologically better spherical microspheres were obtained at 20 °C. Increasing the stirring speed produced smaller micro pher s. Smaller microspheres having size < 50 µm were obtained at a stirring speed of 1500 ± 50 rpm.

The particle size of these vesicles is critical for their intended therapeutic benefits. Formulation and processing factors affect greatly the physical characteristics of the resulted nanosystems. Therefore, the present work was adopted to investigate how proper manipulation of various formulations and processing factors on vesicular Z-average particle size. The selected variables were membrane additives, [including cholesterol (CHO), dicetylphosphate (DCP) and stearylamine (SA) ], sonication time as well as drug loading factor (using mannitol and estradiol). <b>Sorbitan</b> <b>monopalmitate</b> (span 40) niosomes were prepared by the conventional thin film hydration method. Particle size, measured by Photon Correlation Spectroscopy, and polydispersity indices were measured and compared. The results indicated that CHO increased the vesicular size, with 2 : 1 and 1 : 1 (span 40 :CHO) ratios showing the same size. Sonication reduced the vesicle size by 23, 35 and 42 &#x 0025; after 10, 20 and 30 min, respectively. After 30 min, the effect of sonication was minor.
