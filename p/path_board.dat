40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a two-channel digital control {{system for the}} hydraulic stand MZPK 100 designed for fatigue tests of cruciform specimens under biaxial tension-compression. In the past, the fatigue test stand MZPK 100 was provided with unreliable analog control power cubicles. Application of the computer with an analog and digital input-output signal <b>path</b> <b>board,</b> Matlab/Simulink software and a new control box equipped with the necessary electronic subassemblies (responsible for proper switching of the hydraulic supplier, command electrovalves, conditioning of signals from sensors and so on) enables replacement of the old analog system by a new two-channel digital control system. Nowadays, {{it is easy to}} modify the control system to different requirements of material tests because the hardware (electronic) solutions have been simplified, and the software has a friendly Simulink interface. Such an approach allows for the implementation of different control algorithms, e. g. PID, adaptive, and fuzzy logic etc. Moreover, this paper {{presents a}} description of how to keep the center of the specimen static under a controlled force that is being applied by four independent actuators...|$|E

5000|$|Visualizing {{the game}} tree: Visualizing future {{branches}} of the game tree is also much more difficult. Each move determines the next move, and therefore reading ahead—predicting future moves—follows a much less linear <b>path.</b> Future <b>board</b> positions are no longer interchangeable, each move leading to starkly different possible future positions. This makes the game tree far more difficult to visualize, leaving many possible paths overlooked.|$|R

50|$|Write cache is {{protected}} by mirroring within a pair of SVC nodes, called I/O group. Virtualized resources (= storage volumes presented to hosts) are distributed across I/O groups to improve performance. Volumes can also be moved nondisruptively between I/O groups, e.g., when new node pairs are added or older technology is removed. Node pairs are always active, meaning both members accept simultaneous writes for each volume. In addition, all other cluster nodes accept and forward read and write requests which are internally handled by the appropriate I/O group. <b>Path</b> or <b>board</b> failures are compensated by non-disruptive failover within each I/O group, or optionally across dispersed I/O groups. Hosts must have multipath drivers installed, such as IBM Subsystem Device Driver (SDD) or standard MPIO drivers.|$|R
5000|$|REI is a Washington {{corporation}} {{governed by}} a board of 13 directors, including the CEO. Directors serve for terms of one or three years. Board candidates are selected by the REI Board Nomination and Governance Committee. In earlier years, board elections were competitive elections, with both board-nominated and self-nominated petition candidates. In recent years, REI eliminated the opportunity for petition candidates and has nominated only as many candidates as open positions. Members are mailed a ballot, and nominees must garner 50% of returned ballots; members may also vote online. While the board serves at the members' pleasure, there is no <b>path</b> to <b>board</b> membership without {{the approval of the}} Board Nomination and Governance Committee. [...] For 2014, its chief executive officer received compensation of approximately $2.71 million per year.|$|R

60|$|But {{we could}} not stand on that narrow <b>path</b> of <b>boards</b> while the train was passing. The cars would almost touch us. What could we do? I {{believe that if we}} had had time, we would have climbed down on the trestle-work below the bridge, and so let the train pass over us. But {{whatever}} could be done must be done instantly, and we could think of nothing better than to get outside of the railing and hold on as well as we could. In this position we would, at any rate, be far enough from the cars to prevent them from touching us. So out we got, and stood on the ends of the timbers, holding fast to the slender hand-rail. And on came the train! When the locomotive first touched the bridge we could feel the shock, and as it came rattling and grinding over the rails towards us--coming right on to us, as it seemed--our faces turned pale, you may well believe.|$|R

50|$|In the {{original}} Schaper game, players took turns moving marbles up a 3-D Mountain shaped board. Each turn, a player would use an hourglass-shaped teeter-totter device {{to determine the}} amount of spaces they could move that turn. They would then pick one of their marbles and move it along the <b>board's</b> <b>path</b> that number of spaces. If the marble ends its move on a space where another marble is, it continues along to the next open space. If the marble lands on a hole space, they drop their marble into the hole, where it comes out lower on the board. If they managed to get their marble {{to the top of the}} mountain, they would drop it into a hole in the middle. This could trigger a crown to pop up and the player would win. If not, the player would start their marble back on the track.|$|R
50|$|The hyphen has {{a similar}} {{function}} as the a modifier of XBetza, but has the advantage that also the atoms themselves can be specified differently on each leg of the move, where in XBetza {{this has to be}} specified in a rather contrived way by use of the range-toggling modifiers and unnatural direction specifiers. With the sequencing operators it is easy to specify a specific <b>path</b> over the <b>board,</b> e.g. mW-F for the Xiangqi horse, which must make a W step to a square that must be empty (i.e. it can be blocked there), followed by a diagonal outward step which can do anything.

50|$|History of NCSThe Neurocritical Care Society {{was formed}} in 2002 with Dr. Thomas P. Bleck as the {{founding}} president. The society’s first annual meeting was held in Phoenix, AZ in February 2003, and it has expanded to a current membership in excess of 1000 members. NCS is an interdisciplinary society, with membership roles spanning multiple physician disciplines, nursing, advanced practice providers, pharmacists and other allied health providers who specialize {{in the care of}} patients with severe neurological illness. In the early years, the <b>path</b> to physician <b>board</b> certification in neurocritical care often involved dual residency training in neurology as well as internal medicine because critical care experience was not available to neurology residents. Fellowship training in neurocritical care now constitutes a minimum of 2 years with focused training in general critical care and neurologic critical care. Neurocritical care as a subspecialty was accepted in the USA by the United Council of Neurological Subspecialties (UCNS) in 2006. The first neurocritical care board examination was held in 2007, and currently there are over a 1000 certified diplomates.|$|R

50|$|XBoard uses an {{extended}} form of Betza notation to handle bent moves, {{as well as}} locust moves, which capture pieces on a square they do not end on (such as checkers, or en-passant capture). Such moves are described as multi-step moves {{with the aid of}} a new modifier a, indicating the piece can move again after having already made a move belonging to the atom. The usual system of modifiers can then be used to specify the properties of the initial and following step independently: what is written before the a applies to the first step, what is written after it to the second. So camK would describe a piece that captures as a king, and then again moves as king to an empty square (a sort of bent checker). By having multiple a modifiers a move can be broken into many steps, specifying an exact <b>path</b> across the <b>board,</b> and what conditions each of the squares along the path must satisfy in terms of occupation for the over-all move to be allowed.|$|R

40|$|In {{the late}} 1990 s and early 2000 s, China’s Ministry of Education {{embarked}} on an ambitious program of elementary school mergers by shutting down small village schools and opening up larger centralized schools in towns and county seats. The goal {{of the program was}} to improve the teacher and building resources in an attempt to raise the human capital of students in poor rural areas, although it was recognized that students would lose the opportunity to learn in the settings of their own familiar villages. Because of the increased distances to the new centralized schools, the merger program also entailed building boarding facilities and encouraging or mandating that students live at school during the week away from their family. Given the magnitude of the program and the obvious mix of benefits and costs that such a program entails there has been surprisingly little effort to evaluate the impact of creating a new system that transfers students from school to school during their elementary school period of education and, in some cases, making student live in boarding facilities at school. In this paper, our overall goal is to examine the impact of the Rural Primary School Merger Program on academic performance of students using a dataset from a survey that we designed to reflect transfer <b>paths</b> and <b>boarding</b> statuses of students. We use OLS and Propensity Score Matching approaches and demonstrate that there is a large “resource effect” (that is, an effect that appears {{to be associated with the}} better facilities and higher quality of teachers in the town and county schools) that appears to be associated with the transfers of students from less centralized schools (such as, village schools) to more centralized schools. Boarding, however, is shown to have negative impacts on academic performance. However, students who transfer to county school benefit from the transfer no matter where they start and whether they board or not. ...|$|R
