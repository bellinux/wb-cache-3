40|$|The {{question}} of how long a particle takes to <b>pass</b> <b>trough</b> a potential barrier is still a controversial topic in quantum mechanics. Arguably, the main theoretical problem in obtaining estimates for measurable times {{is the fact that}} previously defined time operators, that remained within the borders of standard quantum mechanics, present some kind of pathology. Recently a time operator has been defined and shown to support, both Hermiticity and canonical relation with an energy observable. The theory is built in a framework which treats space and time as symmetrically as possible, in the nonrelativistic regime. In this work we use this formalism to derive a closed analytic expression for the traversal time of a quantum particle impinging on a constant-potential barrier. We test our theory in the specific experimental scenario of a well-known realization by Rafagni et al [Appl. Phys. Lett. 58, 774 (1991) ].

In this study we make an attempt to estimate Balassa- Samuelson (BS) effect in Bulgaria (after {{the introduction of the}} Currency Board). The BS explanation of inflation (or dual inflation) has acquired both academic recognition and popularity in practice in the recent years. The results of our empirical estimation do not provide a robust verification of the existence of BS effect in spite of the observed prerequisites and the accompanying economic indicators interrelations. Actually there are several factors that interfere with the BS effect lying in the wage convergence process in both sectors and others that influence productivity developments in the sectors.

Marlene continued to strengthen as it moved west-southwestward, aided by a surge in the monsoon. An eye formed on March 31, and on the next day the storm became a tropical cyclone. The eye reached a diameter of 25 km (15 mi), embedded within a well-defined central dense overcast. Later on April 1, Marlene became an intense tropical cyclone, just three days after its genesis.

The trough that turned it to the south later caused the cyclone to weaken and for the eye to dissipate. On April 5, Marlene was downgraded into a severe tropical storm and subsequently drifted to the northwest, influenced by a ridge behind the trough.
