40|$|Bifurcations of solitary {{waves are}} {{classified}} for the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equations with arbitrary nonlinearities and external potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. Analytical conditions are derived for three major types of solitary wave bifurcations, namely saddle-node bifurcations, pitchfork bifurcations and transcritical bifurcations. Shapes of <b>power</b> <b>diagrams</b> near these bifurcations are also obtained. It is shown that for pitchfork and transcritical bifurcations, their <b>power</b> <b>diagrams</b> look differently from their familiar solution-bifurcation diagrams.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{numerical}} method for solving {{a class of}} optimization problems known as optimal location or quantization problems. The target energy can be written either in terms of atomic measures and the Wasserstein distance or in terms of weighted points and <b>power</b> <b>diagrams</b> (generalized Voronoi diagrams). The latter for-mulation is more suitable for computation. We show that critical points of the energy are centroidal <b>power</b> <b>diagrams,</b> which are generalizations of centroidal Voronoi tessel-lations, {{and that they can}} be approximated by a generalization of Lloyd’s algorithm (Lloyd’s algorithm is a common method for finding centroidal Voronoi tessellations). We prove that the algorithm is energy decreasing and prove a convergence theorem. Numerical experiments suggest that the algorithm converges linearly. We illustrate the algorithm in two and three dimensions using simple models of optimal location and crystallization. In particular, we test a conjecture about the optimality of the BCC lattice for a simplified model of block copolymers. ...|$|R

A <b>power</b> <b>diagram</b> is a type of Voronoi diagram defined from a set of circles using the power distance; it can also {{be thought of as a}} weighted Voronoi diagram in which a weight defined from the radius of each circle is added to the squared distance from the circle's center.|$|E

Similarly, the radical center of three circles is the unique point with equal power to all three circles. There exists a unique circle, centered on the radical center, that intersects all three given circles orthogonally, equivalently, tangents drawn from the radical center to all three circles have equal length. The <b>power</b> <b>diagram</b> of a set of circles divides the plane into regions within which the circle minimizing the power is constant.|$|E

Bregman divergences are canonical distortion measures of flat spaces induced by strictly convex and differentiable functions, called Bregman generators. Considering a representation function further allows us to conveniently embed the not necessarily flat source space into a dually flat space for which the dual Voronoi diagrams {{can be derived from}} an equivalent <b>power</b> affine <b>diagram.</b> We explain the fundamental dualities induced by the pair of Legendre convex conjugates coupled with a pair of conjugate representations. In particular, we show that Amari’s celebrated family of α-divergences and Eguchi and Copas’s β-divergences are two cases of representational Bregman divergences that are often considered in information geometry. We report closedform formula for their centroids and describe their dual Voronoi diagrams on the induced statistical manifolds.
