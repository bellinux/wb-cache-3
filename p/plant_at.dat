A scale model was produced by Lima with this nameplate affixed. The name was removed in March 1990 and transferred to the Class 47 locomotive 47330, which was renumbered 47390 for a period, retaining the name. This locomotive was later rebuilt as a Class 57, and renamed 'The Hood' by its new operator, Virgin Trains.|$|E

The first geothermal power plant in Russia was built at Pauzhetka, Kamchatka, in 1966, with a capacity of 5MW.

40|$|Effects of {{planting}} depth on emergence, growth, development and yield of turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) in dark red soil (Shimajiri Mahji) were evaluated in Okinawa, Japan. Turmeric <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> {{the depths of}} 8, 12 and 16 cm emerged earlier and more evenly than that <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> a shallower depth in both glasshouse and field experiments. Weed growth was unaffected by the planting depth of turmeric until 50 - 60 days after planting (DAP), but affected thereafter due to mutual shading with the canopy. Weed biomass at 90 - 140 DAP was significantly smaller in the fields where turmeric was <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> the depths of 8, 12 and 16 cm than in the field where it was <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> a shallower depth. The turmeric rhizome (yield) developed earlier when <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> 8, 12 and 16 cm depths than at 4 cm. In a glasshouse study, shoot biomass and yield of turmeric were significantly greater when <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> the depths of 4, 8 and 12 cm than that of 2 cm. In field experiments, they were also significantly greater when planting depth was 8 or 12 cm than 4 cm. Even in turmeric <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> a 16 cm depth shoot dry weight and yield were greater than that <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> a 4 cm depth, but it was comparatively difficult to harvest rhizomes in this field. About 30 % of turmeric in the field <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> a 4 cm depth was uprooted by a typhoon, {{but not at the}} depths of 8, 12 and 16 cm. The over all results suggested that rhizomes of turmeric should be <b>planted</b> <b>at</b> a depth of 8 to 12 cm in dark red soil for a higher yield and lower weed competition...|$|R
