5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (<b>Power</b> <b>assisted)</b> with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
25|$|Has {{one or more}} {{auxiliary}} propulsion motors attached that have a combined output {{of no more than}} 200 watts or 250 watts if complying to European Standard for <b>Power</b> <b>Assisted</b> Pedal Cycles (EN 15194).|$|E
25|$|Large {{vehicles}} are usually fitted with power operated or <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> parking brakes. <b>Power</b> <b>assisted</b> parking brakes are usually found on large vans {{as well as}} some older heavy vehicles. These operate {{in the same way as}} a conventional parking brakes, but pulling the lever operates a valve that allows air or hydraulic pressure or vacuum into a cylinder which applies force to the brake shoes and makes applying the parking brake easier. When releasing the parking brake, the same mechanism also provides assistance to the driver in disengaging the ratchet. Particularly on commercial vehicles with air operated brakes, this has the added benefit of making it much harder or even impossible to release the parking brake when insufficient air pressure is available to operate the brakes. A reservoir or accumulator is usually provided so a limited amount of power assistance is available with the engine off.|$|E
40|$|Recently, <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> suits which support human {{physical}} activities have been researched. We {{are developing a}} <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> suit for workers in a nuclear power plant. If a 	disaster happens, the workers have to wear heavy radiation protective equipment. The <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> suit is supposed to support the wearer so that it reduces the load of the radiation protection equipment during an operation. This paper proposes a <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> control method based on motion prediction using 9 -axis motion sensors. The <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> suit enables rapid <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> because the motion sensor can detect the start of walking motion in real time. A motion database consists of angles and angular velocities of wearerâ€™s chest, lower limbs, and joint angles of the <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> suit. The <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> suit recognizes {{the motion of the}} wearer based on the database. 	Then, it assists the wearer based on the estimation of the motion of the wearer. We conduct experiments to evaluate the proposed method...|$|R

25|$|Two {{models were}} offered: AN68/1R (9.4m in length) and AN68/2R (10.2m in length). <b>Power</b> <b>assisted</b> {{steering}} was standard on the AN68/2R and optional on the AN68/1R. The steering pump was power driven, which replaced the early belt driven system, while the only available engine {{was the new}} Leyland O.680. A wide variety of body styles from various manufacturers continued to be offered, allowing the Atlantean to be tailor made to requirements from operators ranging from the small independent to the large city corporation.|$|E
25|$|While {{of similar}} {{size and weight}} to the {{aircraft}} discussed in the press, the Model T had unequal span wings, with the upper wing having a span of 134feet, while it was planned to be powered by four tractor 250hp (187kW) Curtiss V-4 engines installed, unusually for the time, individually on the middle wing. The two pilots and flight engineer were provided with an enclosed cabin, similar to the America, while to reduce control loads, small windmills could {{be connected to the}} aileron cables by electrically operated clutches to act as a form of <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> controls.|$|E
25|$|This {{new type}} of {{variable}} assist power steering has since spread throughout the vehicle population. DIRAVI as it was called, allowed great assistance to the motorist while parking, but little assistance at motorway speeds. The system adjusts the hydraulic pressure on the steering centering cam according to vehicle speed so {{that the amount of}} steering feel remained almost constant at any speed, counteracting the tendency of manual and ordinary <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> steering to feel light at high speed. Thus the car turns easily at low speed, emphasized by high gearing given two turns lock-lock, and relatively more effort is required at higher speed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Power</b> <b>assists</b> {{originated}} in the need and desire to move convertible body-style tops up and down by some means other than human effort.

25|$|The U-2's flight {{controls}} {{are designed for}} high-altitude flight; the controls require light control inputs at operational altitude. However, at lower altitudes, the higher air density and lack of a <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> control system makes the aircraft very difficult to fly. Control inputs must be extreme to achieve the desired response, {{and a great deal}} of physical strength is needed to operate the controls in this manner. The U-2 is very sensitive to crosswinds, which, together with its tendency to float over the runway, makes the aircraft notoriously difficult to land. As it approaches the runway, the cushion of air provided by the high-lift wings in ground effect is so pronounced that the U-2 will not land unless the wing is fully stalled. A landing U-2 is accompanied on the ground by a chase car and an assisting U-2 pilot calling off the angles and decreasing aircraft height as the aircraft descends.|$|E

2500|$|Near {{the tail}} goit of the Wadsley works, the Don {{was joined by}} a small tributary, on which was located Rawsons Mill or Bark Mill. The mill {{building}} was separated from its dam by {{the building of the}} railway. The mill housed grinding wheels in 1862, but was used for milling corn in 1934. The dam remains full, overflowing through a culvert which passes beneath the railway. Owlerton Rolling Mill was next, located on the west bank, but was destroyed by fire around 1883. It had been reconstructed by 1907, when steam <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> the water wheels, and was demolished in 1936. Only {{a small part of the}} weir remains. The next weir supplied Old Park corn mill, which was built around 1673. In 1807 a lease was issued to a group of 32 tenants, which included a miller, grinders, cutlers, a button maker, a scissorsmith and an ivory turner. In the early 20thcentury, it was known as Old Park Forge, and so had presumably changed its use. Old Park paper, silver or rolling mill followed. In 1795 it had a [...] undershot wheel for rolling copper plates, and another of [...] for rolling silver. The River Loxley joins the Don opposite the mill site, and the building was badly damaged by the great flood of 1864. The tenant claimed Â£1,932 in compensation, and received Â£1,720. A steam engine replaced the large water wheel in 1875, and the rest of the works was electrified in 1920. Sheffield Steel Rolling Co. continued to work the site until 1980.|$|E
