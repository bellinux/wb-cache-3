2500|$|A {{significant}} amount of {{research in this area}} has been spent exploring methods of nanoparticle-mediated delivery of antineoplastic drugs to tumors in the central nervous system. For example, radiolabeled polyethylene glycol coated hexadecylcyanoacrylate nanospheres targeted and accumulated in a rat gliosarcoma. However, this method is not yet ready for clinical trials, due to the accumulation of the nanospheres in surrounding healthy tissue. Another, more promising approach, is the coating of polyalkylcyanoacrylate or poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles with polysorbate 80 or <b>poloxamer</b> 188. [...] Due to this coating the particles [...] adsorb apolipoproteins E or A-1 from the blood and [...] thus interact with the LRP1 or with the scavenger receptor followed by transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier into the brain. These particles loaded with doxorubicin for the treatment of glioblastomas are presently in Clinical Phase I. Recently, a novel class of multifunctional nanoparticles known as magneto-electric nanoparticles (MENs) has been discovered for externally controlled targeted delivery and release of drug(s) across BBB as well as wireless stimulation of cells deep in the brain. This approach depends more on the field control and less on the cellular microenvironment. In vitro and in vivo (on mice) experiments to prove the feasibility of using MENs to release a drug across BBB on demand and wirelessly stimulate the brain have been conducted by the research group of Prof. Sakhrat Khizroev at Florida International University (FIU).|$|E

40|$|<b>Poloxamers,</b> {{also known}} as Pluronics®, are block {{copolymers}} of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(propylene oxide) (PPO), which have an amphiphilic character and useful association and adsorption properties emanating from this. <b>Poloxamers</b> find use in many applications that require solubilization or stabilization of compounds and also have notable physiological properties, including low toxicity. Accordingly, <b>poloxamers</b> serve well as excipients for pharmaceuticals. Current challenges facing nanomedicine revolve around the transport of typically water-insoluble drugs throughout the body, followed by targeted delivery. Judicious design of drug delivery systems leads to improved bioavailability, patient compliance and therapeutic outcomes. The rich phase behavior (micelles, hydrogels, lyotropic liquid crystals, etc.) of <b>poloxamers</b> makes them amenable to multiple types of processing and various product forms. In this review, we first present the general solution behavior of <b>poloxamers,</b> focusing on their self-assembly properties. This {{is followed by a}} discussion of how the self-assembly properties of <b>poloxamers</b> can be leveraged to encapsulate drugs using an array of processing techniques including direct solubilization, solvent displacement methods, emulsification and preparation of kinetically-frozen nanoparticles.

The solutions of the <b>poloxamers</b> with a polyoxyethylene content of greater than 10 % of the overall molecular weight are optically transparent over {{the temperature of the}} phase transition and the solutions of the polyoxypropylene samples are optically transparent below the phase transition and turbid at elevated temperatures. The temperature (T-m) at which the differential excess heat capacity (Cp,m) is a maximum decreases with increasing polyoxypropylene content for both <b>poloxamers</b> and polyoxypropylene samples. Multiple linear regression analysis of calorimetric parameters show strong relationships to the polyoxypropylene content of the <b>poloxamers.</b> The observed phase transitions for both <b>poloxamers</b> and polyoxypropylene samples are reversible and unaffected by scan rate (10, 30 and 60 Khr(- 1)) and hence show no obvious kinetic limitations...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{contains two}} projects that use computer simulations {{as a powerful}} research tool to study polymeric systems. The first project is to study the crystallization of polymer melts {{in the presence of}} nanoparticles. Experimental results show that the presence of nanoparticles enhances the crystallization of polymer melts whether the interaction between particles and polymers is attractive or repulsive. The results imply that the effect of particles on the crystallization of polymer melts is entropic. Molecular dynamics simulations with a coarse-grained model were performed to investigate the mechanism of the enhancement. My simulation results show that the presence of particles locally induces the ordering of polymers in the melt state and modifies the free energy landscape of the system. As a result, it promotes the crystallization of polymer melts. My findings are consistent with experimental observations which indicate the entropic effect of the included particles. ^ In the second project, I study the effective interactions in poloxamer-lipid mixture at the air/water interface and try to understand the sealing mechanism of <b>poloxamers</b> to the damaged cell membrane. After a careful analysis of the systems under study, we proposed a simple model to describe them. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations were performed. My simulation results agree well with experimental observations, namely, the adsorption of <b>poloxamers</b> onto the air/water interface induces large amount of lateral pressure jump and crystal-like clusters of lipids formed and corralled by <b>poloxamers.</b> The compression of the interface will squeeze out <b>poloxamers,</b> and the structure of lipid clusters remains and the cluster size increases. My results also show that the driving force for the cluster formation of lipids and the corralling effect of <b>poloxamers</b> to lipids are the size mismatch between lipids and <b>poloxamers</b> and the soft long-range repulsion between <b>poloxamers.</b> These two conditions are necessary for the observations. Because our model is generic, our finding can provide a guideline for how to form high-ordered clusters of nanoparticles in two dimensions. ...|$|R

The <b>poloxamers</b> have been shown to incorporate into cellular membranes affecting the microviscosity of the membranes. Interestingly the polymers seem to have the greatest effect when absorbed by the cell as an unimer rather than as a micelle. Effect on multi drug resistant cancer cells <b>Poloxamers</b> have been shown to preferentially target cancer cells, due to differences in the membrane of these cells when compared to noncancer cells. <b>Poloxamers</b> have also been shown to inhibit MDR proteins and other drug efflux transporters on the surface of cancer cells; the MDR proteins are responsible for the efflux of drugs from the cells and hence increase the susceptibility of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin. [...] Another effect of the polymers upon cancer cells is the inhibition of the production of ATP in multi-drug resistant (MDR) cancer cells. The polymers seem to inhibit respiratory proteins I and IV, and the effect on respiration seems to be selective for MDR cancer cells, which may be explained by the difference in fuel sources between MDR and sensitive cells (fatty acids and glucose respectively). The <b>poloxamers</b> have also been shown to enhance proto-apoptotic signaling, decrease anti-apoptoic defense in MDR cells, inhibit the glutathione/glutathione S-transferase detoxification system, induce the release of cytochrome C, increase reactive oxygen species in the cytoplasm, and abolish drug sequestering within cytoplasmic vesicles.

The partition coefficients in water/ 1 -octanol of the linear polyethers up to three monomers were calculated. The partition coefficients evidenced a higher hydrophobicity of the PPO in comparison to PEO. At the water/n-heptane interface, the polymers tend to adopt elongated conformations in agreement with similar experimental ellipsometry studies of different <b>poloxamers.</b> In {{the case of the}} <b>poloxamers</b> at the n-heptane/water interface, the stronger preference of the PPO block for the hydrophobic phase resulted in bottle-brush-type polymer conformations. At lipid bilayer/water interface, the PEO polymers, as expected from their hydrophilic nature, are weakly adsorbed {{on the surface of the}} lipid bilayer and locate in the water phase close to the headgroups. The free energy barriers of permeation calculated for short polymer chains suggest a thermodynamics propensity for the water phase that increase with the chain length. The lower affinity of PEO for the hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer resulted in the spontaneous expulsion within the simulation time. On the contrary, PPO chains and <b>poloxamers</b> have a longer residence time inside the bilayer, and they tend to concentrate in the tail region of the bilayer near the polar headgroups.

40|$|Levofloxacin is a {{synthetic}} broad-spectrum antibacterial agent for oral or intravenous administration. Chemically, levofloxacin is the levorotatory isomer (L-isomer) of racemate ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent. Quinolone derivatives rapidly and specifically inhibit {{the synthesis of}} bacterial DNA. Levofloxacin has in vitro activity against {{a broad range of}} aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, formulation of combined <b>poloxamers</b> thermoregulated (as Pluronic® F 127) and levofloxacin for use in multiresistant bacterial treatment were poorly described in the current literature. Thus, the aim of the present work is to characterize <b>poloxamers</b> for levofloxacin controlled release and their use in the treatment of multidrug bacterial resistance. Micelles were produced in colloidal dispersions, with a diameter between 5 and 100 [*]nm, which form spontaneously from amphiphilic molecules under certain conditions as concentration and temperature. Encapsulation of levofloxacin into nanospheres showed efficiency and enhancement of antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae when compared with only levofloxacin. Furthermore, all formulations were not cytotoxic for NIH/ 3 T 3 cell lineage. In conclusion, <b>poloxamers</b> combined with levofloxacin have shown promising results, better than alone, decreasing the minimal inhibitory concentration of the studied bacterial multiresistance strains.

40|$|The phase {{transition}} properties of <b>poloxamers,</b> in dilute aqueous solution (1 % w/v), detected by high-sensitivity {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (HSDSC) and differential scanning densitometry (DSD) at a scan rate of 30 K h - 1 are reported. <b>Poloxamers</b> are ABA block copolymers of poly(oxyethylene) (A) and poly(oxypropylene) (B). The molecular weights of the <b>poloxamers</b> examined range from 2400 to 14 000. The solutions are transparent over the temperature range of the observed {{phase transition}}. By HSDSC, the temperatures (T m) at which the differential excess heat capacity (C p,m) is a maximum range from 297 to 313 K and show good agreement with T m values obtained by DSD. The observed T m values decrease with increasing poly(oxypropylene) content. The calorimetric enthalpy (ΔH cal) of the phase transitions, which range from 133 to 337 kJ mol - 1, increases with increasing poly(oxypropylene) content. The partial specific volume changes (Δῡ) of the phase transitions range from 5. 6 × 10 - 3 to 6. 2 × 10 - 2 cm 3 g - 1. The experimentally determined partial specific volumes (ῡ) for the <b>poloxamers</b> in dilute aqueous solution, at temperatures below the phase transition, agree reasonably well with those calculated for β and γ lattice structure forms (orthorhombic perpendicular or monoclinic lattice, respectively). At temperatures above the T m, experimental ῡvalues agree more closely with those calculated for the theoretical α form of hexagonally packed chains based on alkanols, characteristic of the more expanded form. The DSD data are {{discussed in terms of}} partial molal volume (V̄ 2 0) and expansibility (Ē 2 0) at inifinte dilution in water. Both parameters show a dependence on temperature. This suggests that the <b>poloxamers</b> undergo a gradual change in molecular size as a function of temperature, possibly accompanied by a rapid conformational change around the observed T m. Cooperatively values (ΔH vH/ΔH cal) of the phase transitions from HSDSC data are between 1. 2 and 2. 8; this together with the asymmetry of the transitions is indicative of an aggregation process. The relationships between ΔV̄ 2 0 and ΔH cal per average monomer unit vs poly(oxypropylene) (POP) /poly(oxyethylene) (POE) ratio indicate that the observed phase transition is associated with the POP portion of the polymer, as both parameters approach zero as the POP/POE ratio approaches 0 : 1. The observed phase transitions are reversible and are unaffected by scan rate (10, 30 and 60 K h - 1) using both techniques and hence show no kinetic limitations. The parameters derived from HSDSC and DSD data for the <b>poloxamers</b> are analyzed in terms of possible microscopic and macroscopic phenomena occurring during the phase transitions. © 1993 American Chemical Society...|$|R
