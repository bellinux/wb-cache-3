5|$|Hennig and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows {{along the back of}} the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row of plates on the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having a very broad base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on the hips, at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulder, because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Robert Foehl {{died and}} Evelyn Foehl sold {{the hotel to}} Ramada, a hotel chain. The Ramada {{managers}} remodeled the hotel, stripping out and covering {{much of what they}} considered an outdated interior. The hotel was named Ramada Valley Ho. Though it remained a fashionable location for a while, its original character was largely absent and it began to suffer from neglect and disrepair. It continued to host conferences and business meetings, such as the Natural Health, Aromatherapy and Herb Conference & Trade Show in early 2000, and the Arizona LANBasher's League party in early 2001. Later that year, the hotel closed and was put on the market. Plans for its demolition were considered when no offers were made. To protect it, Alan Hess wrote a letter detailing its importance, and a successful campaign was mounted in Scottsdale to <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Scottsdale Historic Register in recognition of its significance to city history and its architectural connection to the past. To save it from demolition, business partners Scott Lyon and Bill Nassikas of Westroc Hotels & Resorts bought the property and undertook an extensive renovation and building addition that eventually cost $80M. Evelyn Foehl died in August 2003, two years after the hotel was closed for renovation.|$|E
5|$|The {{place where}} Ahalya is held to have practised her penance and was {{redeemed}} has been celebrated in scriptures as a sacred {{place called the}} Ahalya-tirtha. A tirtha is a sacred place with a body of water, where pilgrims generally bathe to purify themselves. The location of the Ahalya-tirtha is disputed: according to some scriptures, {{it is on the}} river Godavari, others <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> river Narmada. Two sites are widely held to be the Ahalya-tirtha. One is located near Ahalyeshvara Temple in Bhalod, {{on the banks of the}} Narmada; another is located in Darbhanga district, Bihar. The Ahilya Asthan temple in Ahalya-gram ("Ahalya's village") in the same district is dedicated to Ahalya. For those seeking to attract women and be handsome like the love-god Kamadeva, the Matsya Purana and the Kurma Purana prescribe the worship of Ahalya at the Ahalya-tirtha. This is to be done on the day of Kamadeva, in the Hindu month of Chaitra. According to the texts, he who bathes in the tirtha will enjoy pleasure with the celestial nymphs.|$|E

25|$|Before eating, most dining places provide {{either a}} {{hot or cold}} towel or a plastic-wrapped wet napkin (o-shibori). This is for {{cleaning}} hands before eating (and not after). It is rude {{to use them to}} wash the face or any part of the body other than the hands, though some Japanese men use their o-shibori to wipe their faces in less formal places. Accept o-shibori with both hands when handed the towel by a server. When finished, fold or roll up the oshibori and <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table.

500|$|In 1973, Oregon {{became the}} first state to decriminalize cannabis. Possession of 28.35grams (1 ounce) or less is a {{violation}} (not a crime) punishable by a $500 to $1,000 fine; stricter punishments exist for sale or cultivation. [...] Possession of 1 ounce to 110grams is a class B felony punishable by 10 years in prison, and possession of more than 110grams is a felony with punishment depending on the defendant's prior record. In 1986, Oregon's Ballot Measure 5 sought to legalize cannabis. The Oregon Marijuana Initiative spent about $50,000 promoting the proposition, and collected the 87,000 signatures necessary to <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ballot. In 1986, by some estimates, cannabis was Oregon's largest cash crop, estimated in 1985 at between $1 billion and $1.15 billion. The ballot measure was rejected by Oregon voters with 279,479 [...] "Yes" [...] and 781,922 [...] "No" [...] votes, or 26.33% support.|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless, Kemper has {{continued}} to display potentially threatening behavior. [...] On one occasion, when Douglas' colleague Robert Ressler was in a cell alone with Kemper, Kemper—who at the time weighed —noticed the apprehension in Ressler after he had pressed a hidden button repeatedly to call a guard to open the cell yet not received a response and told him [...] "Relax. They're changing the shift," [...] but remarked: [...] "If I went apeshit in here, you'd be {{in a lot of}} trouble, wouldn't you? I could screw your head off and <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table to greet the guard." [...] Ressler verbally sparred with Kemper until the guard arrived, ultimately leaving unharmed with Kemper displaying no physical aggression. Kemper also stated afterwards that he was joking, but Ressler never entered a cell alone again with Kemper and it became FBI policy to interview serial killers in pairs.|$|E
500|$|Vancouver won {{the first}} game of the series in Chicago 2–1 in double overtime, but fell behind in game two 3–1. During the game the Canucks felt that referee Bob Myers was making {{questionable}} calls against them. A series of events in the third period ignited tempers. First, Vancouver had a goal disallowed. Soon after, there was a perceived non-call against Chicago, followed by a fourth consecutive penalty called against the Canucks. Denis Savard scored on the power play to put the Black Hawks up 4–1. This enraged the Canucks' bench. Assistant coach Ron Smith yelled out [...] "We give up, we surrender, we give up." [...] Williams suggested to Neilson that he throw sticks onto the ice in protest. Neilson noted that he had done that before, and he had a better idea. He proceeded to take a white towel and <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> end of a hockey stick holding it up in a mock surrender; some of the Canucks' players followed suit.Neilson was ejected from the game along with two players. Vancouver goaltender, Richard Brodeur later noted that although they lost the game the atmosphere in the dressing room was so positive it was as if they had won.|$|E

Measure R included funding for {{the portion of the}} [...] "Subway to the Sea" [...] between Wilshire/Western and Westwood/VA Hospital; a project known as the Westside Subway Extension.

2500|$|The hand often blesses rulers from above, {{especially}} in Carolingian and Ottonian works, and coins. The hand may hold a wreath or crown over the ruler's head, or <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head. A posthumous coin of Constantine the Great (the [...] "deification issue") had shown the hand reaching down {{to pull up}} a veiled figure of Constantine in a quadriga, in a famously mixed message that combined pagan conventions, where an eagle drew deified emperors up to the heavens, with Christian iconography. From the late 4th century coins of Late Antique rulers such as Arcadius (and his empress), Galla Placidia and others show them being crowned by it – {{it was in fact}} mostly used for empresses, and often only appears on issues from the Eastern Empire. This theme is not then seen in Byzantine art until the late 10th century, when it appears in coins of John I Tzimisces (969–976), long after it was common in the West. In later Byzantine miniatures figures the hand is often replaced by a full figure of Christ (in these examples much smaller than the Emperor) placing a crown on the head.|$|E
2500|$|Stricter game rating laws {{mean that}} Germany does not operate within the PEGI. Instead, they adopt their own system of {{certification}} which {{is required by}} law. The Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle (USK or Voluntary Certification of Entertainment Software) checks every game before release and assigns an age rating to it – either none (white), 6 years of age (yellow), 12 years of age (green), 16 years of age (blue) or 18 years of age (red). It is forbidden for anyone, retailers, friends or parents alike, to allow a child access to a game for {{which he or she}} is underage. If a game is considered to be harmful to young people (for example because of extremely violent, pornographic or racist content), it may be referred to the BPjM (Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien – Federal Verification Office for Child-Endangering Media) who may opt to <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Index upon which the game may not be sold openly or advertised in the open media.

2500|$|It was {{in order}} to be in the {{territory}} that is presently the state inhabited by Chichimecas, the so-called Guachichiles, that the conquistadors built several forts or presidios. This was a system devised by Martín Enríquez de Almanza following the strategy that had been developing in Spain throughout the Reconquista period. Therefore, {{in order to protect the}} Camino de la Plata, which stretched between Zacatecas and Mexico City, three presidios [...] founded by the Indian fighter Juan Dominguez, were to be created, which were: the presidio at Las Bocas, later called Las Bocas de Gallardo, situated on the border of Aguascalientes, in what was the jurisdiction of the mayor of Teocaltiche, presently the border of Aguascalientes and Zacatecas; the presidio at Palmillas, which was located near what is now Tepezalá; and the Ciénega Grande presidio, established around 1570. The latter was located on what are now Moctezuma and Victoria Streets, although some historians <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Calle 5 de Mayo (once the Camino Real) at Moctezuma, just in front of the Plaza de Armas. This was a fortress whose purpose was the protection of the Valle de los Romero and the road to Zacatecas, entering this way to secure the passage of convoys loaded with silver and other metals.|$|E
