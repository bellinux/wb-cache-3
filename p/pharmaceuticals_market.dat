Following the period of change, the pharmaceutical industry is expected to continue its expansion. The domestic pharmaceutical market is highly fragmented and inefficient. China, as of 2007, has around 3,000 to 6,000 domestic pharmaceutical manufacturers and around 14,000 domestic pharmaceutical distributors. The most often-cited adverse factors in the marketplace include a lack of protection of intellectual property rights, a lack of visibility for drug approval procedures, a lack of effective governmental oversight, poor corporate support for drug research, and differences in the treatment in China that are accorded to local and foreign firms. Nevertheless, China is reportedly expected to become the third-largest <b>pharmaceuticals</b> <b>market</b> in the world by 2011.|$|E

40|$|It can {{be argued}} that with several players {{marketing}} a large number of brands, the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>market</b> in India is competitive. However, the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>market</b> should not be studied as a single market but, as a sum total {{of a large number of}} individual sub-markets. This paper examines the methodological issues with respect to defining the relevant market involved in studying concentration in the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>market</b> in India. Further, we have examined whether the Indian <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>market</b> is competitive. Indian <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>market</b> was studied using PharmaTrac, the sales audit data from AIOCD-AWACS, that organises formulations into 5 levels of therapeutic classification based on the EphMRA system. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) was used as the indicator of market concentration. We calculated HHI for the entire <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>market</b> studied as a single market as well as at the five different levels of therapeutic classification. Whereas the entire <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>market</b> taken together as a single market displayed low concentration (HHI = 226. 63), it was observed that if each formulation is defined as an individual sub-market, about 69 percent of the total market in terms of market value displayed at least moderate concentration. Market should be defined taking into account the ease of substitutability. Since, patients cannot themselves substitute the formulation prescribed by the doctor with another formulation with the same indication and therapeutic effect, owing to information asymmetry, it is appropriate to study market concentration at the narrower levels of therapeutic classification...|$|R

40|$|Common People and {{government}} authorities are usually {{concerned about the}} unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices in Pakistan, therefore the researcher examines the unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices in Pakistan, and selected Karachi City as Case study for this purpose and analyze the impact of unethical <b>marketing</b> practices in <b>pharmaceutical</b> industry. This study not only evaluates the responsible variables for the unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices but also compare who is more responsible for these unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices in Pakistan. This study also examines, who has initiated these unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices in Pakistan and {{who is responsible for}} the continuation of these practices in Pakistan. In this study researcher focuses six variables that can be a major cause of unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices in Pakistan i. e. <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> and Sales personnel, doctorsâ€™ community, retail and whole sales pharmacies, government and private hospitals personnel, government officials and patients or their attendantsâ€™. All these six variables have been taken and gathered the data through survey questionnaire, compile and analyze through Statistical tools like descriptive and inferential Statistics both and conclude the main cause of unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices in Pakistan. In the under taken study four different hypotheses were developed and tested through Z and F test and also analyze the data through descriptive Statistics, for the descriptive Statistics four different parameters were developed and presented in the form of graphs and tables. The conclusion of the study was that initially pharmaceutical industry was responsible to introduce the unethical marketing practices to their customers i. e. doctors community, and hospitals and later on unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices became the norm of the pharmaceutical industry. Now the doctors are the main cause or reason for the continuation of these unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices in Pakistan. It is further concluded in the study that foreign visits are more common tools in order to get maximum output from the doctor community and now doctors have become more demanding and they ask themselves regarding the foreign and local tours and conferences. Cash incentive and home appliances are another form of unethical practices in the pharmaceutical industry. Clinic and home decoration are also the findings of unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices in the under taken study. However, it is also found that some demands from the doctorsâ€™ community or the offers by the pharmaceutical companies are quite ethical genuine regarding the scientific meeting and local & international scientific conferences. It is further concluded that all the stakeholders are agreed that these unethical <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> practices can be stopped. They are also agreed non-qualified doctorâ€™s practice should be eradicated. Pharmaceutical companies should strictly abide the rules and regulations, which are already mentioned and given in the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>marketing</b> code of ethics, at the same time Pakistan Medical Association and Pakistan Medical and Dental Association should restrict to the doctors community to practice in the limit of ethical and moral grounds.

DESIGN: Nested mixed-methods, cross-sectional study of NHs in a cluster randomized trial. SETTING: Forty-one NHs in Connecticut. PARTICIPANTS: NH administrators, directors of nursing, and medical directors (n = 93, response rate 75. 6 %). MEASUREMENTS: Quantitative data, including prescription drug dispensing data (September 2009 -August 2010) linked with Nursing Home Compare data (April 2011), were used to determine facility-level prevalence of atypical antipsychotic use, facility-level characteristics, NH staffing, and NH quality.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{synthesis}} of novel oxetanyl peptides, where the amide bond {{is replaced by}} a non-hydrolyzable oxetanyl-amine fragment, is reported. This new class of pseudo-dipeptides with the same H-bond donor/acceptor pattern found in proteins expands the repertoire of peptidomimetics. With over 50 marketed drugs and an estimated $ 13 billionmarket in 2010, peptide drugs are important players in pharmaceuticals. 1 This is however, a relatively small share of the total <b>pharmaceuticals</b> <b>market</b> given the broad range of biological activities displayed by this class of compounds. The discrepancy arises from some inherent limitations of peptides in the drug development process, 1 a, 2 including short lifetimes in the stomach, intestine, and plasma, which often result in less than optimal pharmacokinetic profiles. However, the high specificity and potency as well as low toxicity of certain peptides along with advances in drug delivery have led to a renaissance. ...|$|E
