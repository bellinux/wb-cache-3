5|$|In 2004, Safi Thomas {{founded the}} Hip-Hop Dance Conservatory (HHDC) in New York City. Thomas' {{goal was to}} provide a {{comprehensive}} education to hip-hop dancers that was comparable to what ballet, modern, and jazz dancers experience at their respective institutions. HHDC provides a formal curriculum with dance classes (breaking, freestyle, locking, etc.) and academic classes (dance theory, physiology, kinesiology, etc.) to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to pursue hip-hop dance as a career. It is the only educational institution in the United States that is exclusively dedicated to hip-hop dance instruction. HHDC does not grant degrees. It is a non-profit organization and repertory company that grants certifications to dancers that complete the three-year program.|$|E

50|$|Since the 1980s the {{contract}} has been popular among two different groups in Dutch society: <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> to formalise their relationship, {{but did not}} want to marry, and <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> to marry but could not legally do so. With the introduction first of registered partnerships and later the broadening of marriage to include same-sex couples in the Netherlands, the need for a samenlevingscontract for the latter has become less pronounced.|$|R

The Fish, a board which is typically shorter, flatter, and wider than a normal shortboard, often with a split tail (known as a swallow tail). The Fish often has two or four fins and is specifically designed for surfing smaller waves. For big waves there is the Gun, a long, thick board with a pointed nose and tail (known as a pin tail) specifically designed for big waves.|$|E
25|$|The first limited-over {{international}} match {{took place}} at Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1971 as a time-filler after a Test match had been abandoned because of heavy rain on the opening days. It was tried simply as an experiment and to give the players some exercise, but {{turned out to be}} immensely popular. limited-over internationals (LOIs or ODIs—one-day internationals) have since grown to become a massively popular form of the game, especially for busy <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> {{to be able to see}} a whole match. The International Cricket Council reacted to this development by organising the first Cricket World Cup in England in 1975, with all the Test-playing nations taking part.|$|E
25|$|People {{choose to}} wear contact lenses for many reasons. Aesthetics and {{cosmetics}} {{are the main}} motivating factors for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to avoid wearing glasses or to change the appearance of their eyes. Others wear contact lenses for functional or optical reasons. When compared with spectacles, contact lenses typically provide better peripheral vision, and do not collect moisture (from rain, snow, condensation etc.) or perspiration. This can make them preferable for sports and other outdoor activities. Contact lens wearers can also wear sunglasses, goggles, or other eyewear of their choice without having to fit them with prescription lenses or worry about compatibility with glasses. Additionally, there are conditions such as keratoconus and aniseikonia that are typically corrected better with contact lenses than with glasses.|$|E

The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> argued that one inherited the role as a criminal and the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> to keep the death penalty used Nordlund as an example of why this penalty was necessary. Abolitionists such as Hjalmar Branting only argued that it was unfortunate that Nordlund had been released from prison.|$|R

25|$|Many {{of these}} African Americans live in quiet, middle class {{suburban}} neighborhoods near the Nassau County border, such as Laurelton and Cambria Heights which have large black populations whose family income {{is higher than}} average. The migration of European Americans from parts of Queens has been long ongoing with departures from Ozone Park, Woodhaven, Bellerose, Floral Park, and Flushing, etc. (most of the outgoing population has been replaced with Asian Americans). Neighborhoods such as Whitestone, College Point, North Flushing, Auburndale, Bayside, Middle Village, Little Neck, and Douglaston {{have not had a}} substantial exodus of white residents, but have seen an increase of Asian population, mostly Chinese and Korean. Queens has experienced a real estate boom making most of its neighborhoods very desirable for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to reside near Manhattan in a less urban setting.|$|E
25|$|If {{you could}} {{demonstrate}} that the BBC was grossly extravagant {{there might be a}} case for saying OK take it away. But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. If you take the money away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There is a lot of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going. Four radio channels and god knows how many TV channels. It is piffling.|$|E
25|$|Tender is {{a member}} of the fanatical Creedish cult, which engaged in a mass suicide ten years previously. He is one of the Creedish members who was sent out into the world to work as a servant, and send his income back to the Creedish community. Creedish members have been {{steadily}} killing themselves since the mass suicide, in keeping with their belief that the deliverance is at hand. At the start of his story, Tender works as the housekeeper for a rich couple he never sees in Oregon. They issue directions via a daily planner and a speaker phone. At his dingy apartment, he gets phone calls from <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to kill themselves - the result of a newspaper misprint which printed his phone number as the number for a suicide prevention hotline. Tender, enjoying the thrill of passing divine judgment on these people tells them to kill themselves as often as not, and sees this as an act of mercy. Although the newspaper prints a retraction, the calls keep coming, and when they dwindle, Tender prints up fliers for a fake crisis hotline with his number on them so the calls will continue.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{large and}} vocal group of Koreans (consisting {{of a number of}} animal welfare groups) who are against the {{practice}} of eating dogs. Popular television shows like 'I Love Pet' have documented, in 2011 for instance, the continued illegal sale of dog meat and slaughtering of dogs in suburban areas. The program also televised illegal dog farms and slaughterhouses, showing the unsanitary and horrific conditions of caged dogs, several of which were visibly sick with severe eye infections and malnutrition. However, despite this growing awareness, there remain some in Korea that do not eat or enjoy the meat, but do feel that it is the right of others to do so, along with a smaller but still vocal group of pro-dog cuisine <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to popularize the consumption of dog in Korea {{and the rest of the}} world. A group of pro-dog meat individuals attempted to promote and publicize the consumption of dog meat worldwide during the run-up to the 2002 FIFA World Cup, co-hosted by Japan and South Korea, which prompted retaliation from animal rights campaigners and prominent figures such as Brigitte Bardot to denounce the practice. Opponents of dog meat consumption in South Korea are critical of the eating of dog meat, as some dogs are beaten, burnt or hanged to make their meat more tender.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} HMOs—no matter {{whether a person}} is on Medicare or not—persons who enroll in a Medicare Advantage HMO cannot use certain {{specialist}} physicians or out-of-network providers without prior authorization from the HMO, except in emergencies. In almost all Medicare Advantage plans—HMO or otherwise—the beneficiary must choose a primary care physician (PCP) who will provide the referrals and the beneficiary must confirm that the plan authorizes the visit to which the beneficiary was referred by the PCP. As with all HMOs, {{this can be a}} problem for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to use out of network specialists or who are hospitalized and are forced to use out-of-network doctors while in the hospital. Enrolling in a Medicare Advantage PPO, if available, can help solve this dilemma, because many Medicare Advantage PPO plans permit a subscriber to use any physician or hospital without prior authorization, but at a somewhat higher expense. By law, however, if a patient's in-network physician orders tests or procedures or refers a patient to a specialist that are not available or provided by any in-network facility or specialist's office, the Medicare Advantage plan will pay for the patient's procedures or services at an out-of-network location and charge in-network cost-sharing to the patient, so long as the necessary services are normally covered by the plan (the beneficiary should still make sure he or she has authorization however).|$|E

The term agua (literally water in Spanish) is used in the song as a Puerto Rican jargon referring to the police.|$|E
