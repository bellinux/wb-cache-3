5|$|From {{its opening}} in 1961 until 1979, the <b>parkway</b> was {{maintained}} by the East Hudson <b>Parkway</b> Authority, a commission created to maintain tolls on the Saw Mill River <b>Parkway,</b> the Bronx River <b>Parkway</b> and to provide general maintenance for the Taconic State <b>Parkway.</b> The authority was abolished in 1979, at which time, all maintenance of the Sprain Brook <b>Parkway</b> {{was turned over to}} NYSDOT.|$|E
5|$|The <b>parkway</b> was {{proposed}} to help bridge {{a gap in}} the eastern part of the Long Island <b>Parkway</b> system. Construction began in 1949 with the opening of an interchange between Bay Shore Road and the Southern State <b>Parkway.</b> Work on the <b>parkway</b> itself began the following year, with plans calling for connections to three spurs: the Captree State <b>Parkway</b> (now Robert Moses Causeway), the Sunken Meadow Spur (Sunken Meadow State <b>Parkway),</b> and the Heckscher Spur (Heckscher State <b>Parkway).</b> The <b>parkway</b> was completed in 1952, closing the highway loop on Long Island. In 2001, a study by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) called for the Sagtikos State <b>Parkway</b> to be widened to include new bus and carpool lanes from end to end.|$|E
5|$|According to {{annual average}} daily traffic counts {{compiled}} by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) in 2011, the most-traveled part of the <b>parkway</b> is the section north of the Southern State <b>Parkway.</b> This portion carries an average of 106,800 vehicles daily, with the segment between Zeckendorf Boulevard and Old Country Road serving the most at 139,500 vehicles per day. South of the Southern State <b>Parkway,</b> the Meadowbrook <b>Parkway</b> sees only {{an average of about}} 54,000 vehicles daily. The busiest part in this stretch lies between the Babylon Turnpike and the Southern State <b>Parkway,</b> which handles 95,600 vehicles on an average day. The section between the Ocean and Loop parkways is the least-traveled part of the Meadowbrook <b>Parkway,</b> as only 15,400 vehicles use the segment per day on average, although as the gateway to Jones Beach, it is busily traveled during the summer months.|$|E

5|$|Around 1939, the old aqueduct, {{which was}} now a popular hiking trail, started {{becoming}} a popular route with cyclists. Soon after, there was a proposal to redevelop the trail as a bike path. This proposal never came to fruition, although in the mid-1970s, the city built a separate bike path along Mosholu <b>Parkway,</b> the Bronx River <b>Parkway,</b> and Pelham <b>Parkway</b> between Jerome Avenue and Pelham Bay Park.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} project, the Burlington Street and Centennial <b>Parkway</b> {{interchanges}} were reconstructed, and the QEW widened {{to eight}} lanes from Burlington Street to Centennial <b>Parkway.</b> Construction was completed in 2009.|$|E
5|$|At its {{southern}} end {{near the mouth}} of the Don River, the <b>parkway</b> begins in a multiple-level interchange with the ground-level Lake Shore Boulevard and the elevated Gardiner Expressway directly above the boulevard. The Gardiner–Don Valley ramps provide access to the section of the Gardiner Expressway west of the <b>parkway.</b> There is no access either from or to the Gardiner east of the <b>parkway.</b> To travel east from the southbound lanes of the <b>parkway,</b> motorists must exit via the off-ramp to Lake Shore Boulevard, which meets the Lake Shore at a signalized intersection.|$|E
25|$|A new era for National <b>Parkways</b> {{began with}} {{authorization}} of the Blue Ridge and Natchez Trace <b>Parkways</b> during the 1930s. These were not fairly short county or metropolitan <b>parkways</b> serving {{a variety of}} local and national traffic but protected recreational roadways traversing {{hundreds of miles of}} scenic and historic rural landscape. These different National <b>Parkways</b> started out as public works projects during the New Deal and were transformed into units of the National Park System.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of Peterborough's <b>parkways</b> are dual carriageways, {{to accommodate the}} large quantity of local traffic within the city, and national and regional traffic bypassing it. However, due to their age, many of the <b>parkways</b> do not have hard-shoulders. Most of the <b>parkways</b> that bypass the city have graded roundabout junctions.|$|R
5000|$|Founded in 1994, <b>Parkways</b> Foundation was the non-profit, philanthropic {{partner of}} the Chicago Park District. [...] <b>Parkways</b> sought private {{investment}} to enrich the physical and cultural landscape of Chicago's neighborhood parks. [...] The foundation was led by its Board of Directors and supported by over 200 board members including Chicago's corporate and philanthropic leaders. <b>Parkways</b> invested in capital projects, youth cultural and sports programs, and historic preservation in Chicago's neighborhood parks. <b>Parkways</b> projects focused on underserved neighborhoods for the enrichment {{of the lives of}} children and families.|$|R
5|$|At {{the eastern}} edge of the island, the highway reaches Swift Creek, another channel {{separating}} Meadow Island from Jones Island. The <b>parkway</b> crosses the waterway and immediately enters a trumpet interchange with the Meadowbrook State <b>Parkway.</b> The right-of-way of the Loop <b>Parkway</b> connects to and from the northbound direction of the Meadowbrook <b>Parkway</b> while two other ramps provide access to the southbound Meadowbrook <b>Parkway.</b> The Loop <b>Parkway</b> handled an average of 30,520 vehicles per day in 2011 according to estimates made by NYSDOT. Traffic along the highway has steadily increased since 2003, when the department recorded a daily average of 24,740 vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Continuing west, the Meadowbrook State <b>Parkway</b> enters exitM2, a {{cloverleaf}} interchange with Zeckendorf Boulevard (unsigned CR260) {{adjacent to}} nearby Roosevelt Field Mall. Both directions of Zeckendorf Boulevard are accessible southbound, with exitM2E using part of Dibblee Drive; the northbound {{direction of the}} <b>parkway</b> has only one exit, exitM2W for Zeckendorf Boulevard westbound. Past the cloverleaf, the <b>parkway</b> winds back to the northwest as it approaches exitM1, a partial cloverleaf interchange with Old Country Road (unsigned CR25) {{on the border between}} the towns of Hempstead and North Hempstead. The Meadowbrook <b>Parkway</b> continues northwest across Old Country Road into North Hempstead, passing under the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line as it traverses the village of Carle Place. Just north of the community, the Meadowbrook reaches exit31A of the Northern State <b>Parkway,</b> a semi-directional T interchange that serves as {{the north end of the}} Meadowbrook State <b>Parkway.</b>|$|E
5|$|Donald Cousens <b>Parkway</b> is {{intended}} to relieve north-south traffic congestion on York Regional Road68 (Main Street, former Highway48) and York Regional Road69 (Ninth Line), with signage suggesting drivers use the <b>parkway</b> as a through route past Markham. As trucks are prohibited along Main Street, signage guides them onto the <b>parkway.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1979, with Westchester's <b>parkways</b> {{adequately}} upgraded, the EHPA dissolved {{itself and}} turned {{control of all}} its roads, including the Taconic, over to the Department of Public Works' successor, the state Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). The new operator established the Westchester <b>Parkways</b> Commission for public input and planned a program to continue the rehabilitation and upkeep of the <b>parkways.</b>|$|R
50|$|Following {{the example}} of the <b>parkways</b> {{designed}} by Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903), who designed the Eastern and Ocean <b>parkways,</b> the boulevard malls were planted with trees to separate local and through traffic along the street. Unlike Olmsted’s <b>parkways,</b> however, the Kings Highway malls are much narrower because existing development constrained their size; they do not provide the leisurely promenades that characterize Olmsted’s work.|$|R
50|$|The Druid Hills Historic District {{incorporates}} the earlier Druid Hills Parks and <b>Parkways</b> Historic District that was {{listed on the}} National Register in 1975, specifically recognizing the parks and <b>parkways</b> along Ponce de Leon Avenue.|$|R
5|$|Early plans also {{included}} a northsouth freeway {{on each side of}} the Los Angeles Central Business District, splitting at the merge of the Harbor <b>Parkway</b> (Harbor Freeway) and Venice <b>Parkway</b> northeast of the University of Southern California, and rejoining at the split between the Arroyo Seco <b>Parkway</b> (Pasadena Freeway) and Riverside <b>Parkway</b> south of Dodger Stadium. Initially known as the East By-Pass and West By-Pass, the latter later became part of the Harbor <b>Parkway,</b> while the former remained as a separate route roughly along Main Street. The state legislature added the East By-Pass to the state highway system in 1947 as Route 222. The Los Angeles City Planning Commission approved a revised master plan in mid-1955, based on various studied that had been made. A new Industrial Freeway replaced the Terminal Island Freeway and Alamitos <b>Parkway</b> between Terminal Island and downtown Los Angeles, where it then continued north along the former East By-Pass (which was not kept south of the Santa Monica Freeway) and the southern part of the Riverside <b>Parkway</b> to the interchange of the Glendale Freeway and Golden State Freeway (which had replaced the rest of the Riverside <b>Parkway).</b> The Industrial Freeway south of the Santa Monica Freeway became Route 270 in 1959, but the ex-Riverside <b>Parkway</b> piece north of the Arroyo Seco <b>Parkway</b> never became a state highway.|$|E
5|$|Highway {{construction}} in the mid-1930s further altered the park. The first of these proposals was the Grand Concourse Extension, later the Mosholu <b>Parkway</b> Extension, which was already being paved in 1934, when Robert Moses became Parks Commissioner. Moses immediately started planning for the Henry Hudson <b>Parkway,</b> which was originally envisioned {{as an extension of}} Riverside Drive. As proposed, the <b>parkway</b> would have only skirted the park's northwest corner in order to connect with the Saw Mill River <b>Parkway</b> in Westchester. However, due to that plan's high cost, the route was amended and the Henry Hudson <b>Parkway</b> became an extension of the West Side Elevated Highway, cutting straight through the park to intersect with the Saw Mill River <b>Parkway.</b> Unlike the Concourse extension, the Henry Hudson <b>Parkway</b> was minimally opposed by the community, as it was widely seen as an improvement. Work on the <b>parkway</b> began in 1935.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, county {{officials}} admitted {{that it was}} likely that the $7million appropriated would not be enough, and instead {{it would be better}} spent on improving other nearby parkways. The proposed <b>parkway</b> would have needed $400,000 more for additional right-of-way, and the construction costs would leave no money to repave the Bronx River <b>Parkway,</b> the link to the Cross County <b>Parkway,</b> and to extend the Saw Mill River <b>Parkway.</b> The county would have had to spend $8million of its own money as well. The <b>parkway</b> was instead shortened from Bronxville to Elmsford.|$|E

50|$|Laid out in {{the form}} of a cross, the <b>parkways</b> run for four blocks with {{vegetation}} between the lanes for the two directions; they were completed in 1920 after a year of construction. Historic research has identified both streets as fine examples of the implementation of City Beautiful ideas in an extant city. Today, the <b>parkways</b> continue to provide access to a residential neighborhood; most of the houses that line the <b>parkways</b> are newer than the streets themselves, having been built primarily between 1930 and 1959.|$|R
5|$|In April 1950, the State Council of Parks met in Ardsley. Bronxville {{opposed the}} construction, {{claiming}} {{that there would}} be property value depreciation. However, there was no cited opposition for the <b>parkway</b> from any communities further north of Bronxville, and that officials from Westchester County were looking into ideas for an alternate route around Bronxville. At the time, the county had most of the right-of-way in Bronxville claimed, short of one piece. The need for the <b>parkway</b> was helped by the fact that widening of the Bronx River <b>Parkway</b> was not applicable due to land limitations and the prohibitory cost of acquiring land for a widening. The <b>parkway,</b> while creating a needed connection between the Saw Mill River <b>Parkway</b> and the Bronx River <b>Parkway,</b> would not answer the need for diverting traffic off the Hawthorne Circle and the issue {{of what to do with}} truck traffic. The <b>parkway,</b> if started, would take about three years to complete and would be constructed by the Taconic State Park Commission.|$|E
5|$|Just east of Bradhurst Avenue, NY141 {{connects to}} the Taconic State <b>Parkway</b> {{by way of a}} partial interchange. The {{junction}} has only two connections; the first links NY141 to the southbound <b>parkway,</b> while the second leads from the northbound direction of the <b>parkway</b> to NY141 via West Cross Street. Continuing eastward, the highway passes under the <b>parkway</b> and enters the commercial center of Hawthorne. Here, NY141 crosses over the Metro-North Railroad before turning northward onto Elwood Avenue. Over the next , NY141 closely parallels the railroad's Harlem Line, serving its Hawthorne station as the road heads north. After three blocks, the road and railroad turn to the northeast and begin to run alongside the Saw Mill River <b>Parkway.</b> Elwood Avenue ends shortly after the curve, giving way to Commerce Street.|$|E
5|$|Near the Lake Ontario shoreline, NY18F {{connects to}} the Fort Niagara spur of the Niagara Scenic State <b>Parkway</b> via a partial diamond interchange. Only {{westbound}} access is permitted at the location; access to the eastbound spur, and thus the <b>parkway</b> mainline, is provided via NY93 in Youngstown or by NY18 farther east. Past the exit, NY18F turns east and begins to parallel the lakeshore. The route also parallels the mainline Moses <b>Parkway</b> for a short distance before curving south to cross over the <b>parkway</b> and terminate at NY18 {{in the vicinity of}} Four Mile Creek State Park in Porter.|$|E

5|$|Past the exit, the Sagtikos State <b>Parkway</b> crosses under CR13 and {{immediately}} enters exitS1, a large modified cloverleaf interchange with the Long Island Expressway (Interstate495 or I-495). The junction brings the <b>parkway</b> {{into the town}} of Smithtown, where it bends northwestward and parallels CR67 (Vanderbilt Motor <b>Parkway)</b> for a half-mile (0.8km) through the town's Commack section. CR67 eventually turns westward to pass under the Sagtikos <b>Parkway,</b> {{at which point the}} <b>parkway</b> curves back to the north and enters exitSM1E, a cloverleaf interchange serving as the Northern State Parkway's exit44. The Sagtikos State <b>Parkway</b> name ends here while the highway continues northward toward Long Island's North Shore as the Sunken Meadow State <b>Parkway.</b>|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously, work progressed on the Mosholu <b>Parkway</b> Extension, and Mosholu Avenue {{within the}} park was being {{modified}} {{so that it would}} be bisected by Henry Hudson <b>Parkway.</b> A bridge was constructed over the railroad in 1940, and a road linking the avenue and the new Mosholu <b>Parkway</b> was opened the next year. Mosholu <b>Parkway</b> was then extended to the Henry Hudson <b>Parkway</b> via a partial cloverleaf interchange built near the park's sole freshwater marsh. When biology teachers who used the marsh for their classes raised concerns about construction, an assistant to Moses said that the marsh would get a landscaping so that it looked like a series of lagoons surrounded by shrubbery.|$|E
