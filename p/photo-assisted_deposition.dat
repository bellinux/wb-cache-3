40|$|The need {{to produce}} energy more {{efficiently}} {{is a more}} pressing with depleting supply and increasing costs of crude oil sources. Solar energy is an abundant resource that can provide enough energy to meet current and future needs; however, {{more research is needed}} to develop efficient and economically viable devices capable of harnessing solar energy. This dissertation addresses the electrochemical synthesis of zinc oxide and zinc oxide composite materials. Zinc oxide is of interest because it is non-toxic, inexpensive and has wide applicability in solar energy conversion devices. The first part of this dissertation examines the construction and tuning of zinc oxide layered mesoporous materials. Mesoporous materials are of interest because the increased surface areas they provide show great promise for use in energy production devices, catalysis, and sensing applications. Our approach to developing semiconducting mesoporous features is to utilize the self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules on the working electrode as templates for electrodeposition of the material of interest. The final mesoporous structure and orientation can be tuned by changing the length, the head group, or the mixture of surfactants used during deposition. This method is explored during both cathodic and anodic deposition of ZnO. The second part of this dissertation examines the enhancement of photoelectrochemical properties of polycrystalline ZnO films. By exploiting the preferential absorption of chloride ions on the basal facet of ZnO crystals, a selective deposition of Au nanoparticles only on the facet planes of ZnO was achieved during <b>photo-assisted</b> <b>deposition.</b> Additionally, <b>photo-assisted</b> <b>deposition</b> was used to decorate ZnO crystals with a cobalt based oxygen evolution catalyst. Photoelectrochemical properties of the ZnO films were enhanced with the individual addition of either system. ...|$|E

40|$|A non-aqueous, {{organometallic}} {{route to}} nanocomposite Cu@TiO 2 and Cu@ZnO materials is presented. TiO 2 nanorods, stabilized with oleic acid and HDA capped, monodispersed, ZnO nanoparticles with {{a diameter of}} 3, 5 nm were used as support for the <b>photo-assisted</b> <b>deposition</b> of Cu using [Cu(OCH(CH 3) CH 2 N(CH 3) 2) 2]. The copper precursor penetrates through the organic shell at the nanoparticulate oxide surface and is photo reduced to deposit Cu 0 directly onto the semiconductor surface. The obtained Cu decorated nanocomposites were still soluble in nonpolar organic solvents without change of the morphology of carrier. The colloids were characterized by means of UV-VIS, XRD, DLS, AAS, Fluorescence spectroscopy, EDX and HRTEM. FTIR gas adsorption studies provided evidence for Cu 0 anchored at the titania surface. The facile penetration of CO 2 molecules through the organic shell of ZnO nanoparticles and their subsequent conversion to a CO 3 2 - species at the oxide surface is also presented. In dieser Doktorarbeit wird ein nichtw 4 ssriger, organometallischer Weg zu den Nanokompositen Cu@TiO 2 und Cu@ZnO vorgestellt. Die photoassistierten Ablagerungen von Cu auf mit 6 ls 4 ure stabilisierten TiO 2 Nanost 4 bchen, und auf monodispersen ZnO Nanopartikeln (2 Ì† 205 = 3, 5 nm), bedeckt mit HDA, wurden mithilfe von [Cu(OCH(CH 3) CH 2 N(CH 3) 2) 2] durchgef. Der Kupfer Precursor durchdringt die organische Schale und wird direkt auf der Halbleiteroberfl 4 che zu Cu 0 reduziert.

40|$|A TiO(2) nanotube/Ag-AgBr three-component nanojunction with {{enhanced}} visible-light {{activity was}} synthesized by a two-step approach including an electrochemical anodization technique {{followed by an}} in situ <b>photo-assisted</b> dipping and <b>deposition</b> approach. Ag/AgBr nanoparticles with good dispersion were effectively deposited on both the {{inside and outside of}} the TiO(2) nanotubes. Surface photovoltage measurements and luminescence spectra demonstrated that the Ag/AgBr loading enhanced the visible spectral absorption of TiO(2) nanotube arrays, as well as their separation efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, which may due to the nanojunction built between Ag/AgBr and TiO(2) in this system. The photoelectrochemical investigations verified that the TiO(2) nanotube/Ag-AgBr nanojunction showed enhanced photocurrent generation efficiency and had a more effective photoconversion efficiency of 0. 71 % than the aligned TiO(2) nanotube arrays alone.

40|$|I t is {{generally}} {{recognized that the}} key obstacle {{to the development of}} electro-chemical solar cells is photodegradation of the semiconductor electrodes. In principle, this problem could be overcome by the use of an electrically conducting polymer film on the electrode. By acting as a barrier to ion/solvent transport, such an insoluble film would prevent photodegradation while permit-ting electron exchange with the electro-lyte. Good adhesion, uniformity and inter-facial charge transport properties are expected for electrochemically generated films since deposition is initiated at the interface by electrochemical oxidation/ reduction. Electrodeposition of polypyrrole fi~ms, ~aving conductivities in the 10 to 100 ~- ~ cm- ~ range, on Au and Pt electrodes has recently been reported (1 - 3). In this communication, we describe the photoelectro-chemical generation of polypyrrole films on n-GaAs and the characteristics of the result-ing photoanodes. Electrodeposition of polypyrrole on n-GaAs was performed w~th tungsten-halogen illumination (50 mW/cm ~) at a constant elec-trode potential of 0. 45 V vs SCE (saturated calomel electrode) from mechanically stirred acetonitrile solution containing 0. 1 M pyr-role and 0. 1 M Et 4 NBF 4 (supporting eITctro-lyte). The sTmiconductg ~ electrodes ~ere single crystals (3 x 10 ~ carriers/cm J) and were etched in 1 : 1 H 2 SO 4 /H?O 2 solution before use. Deposition on illumifia~ed n-GaAs begins at a less anodic potential (0. 2 V) than on Pt (0. 8 V), as might be expected for a <b>photo-assisted</b> process.
