40|$|During World War II John Huston became involved, {{together}} with other well-known Hollywood filmmakers, in the U. S. government <b>propaganda</b> <b>film</b> <b>production.</b> The essay contrasts Huston’s war documentaries with other propaganda films produced during the conflict, and argues that whereas Report from the Aleutians, Huston’s first non-fiction film, may be incorporated within the propaganda genre and depicts war as an instance where officers and soldiers may aspire to glory, his second documentary, San Pietro, breaks free of this label and shows the ultimate destruction which war brings about. The paper also details the predictably unfavorable reaction of the War Department to Huston’s anti-war stance, and the reasons why many years would have to pass before San Pietro and Let There Be Light, his subsequent war documentary, would be released for general viewing...|$|E
