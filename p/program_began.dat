5|$|In 2006, Metro {{board member}} Jim Graham and D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams {{proposed}} re-extending Yellow Line service to Fort Totten {{or even to}} Greenbelt, which was the originally planned northern terminus for the line. Their proposal did not involve construction of any new track, because either extension would run along the same route as the existing Green Line and would thus relieve crowding on that line. Suburban {{members of the board}} initially resisted the proposal. Through a compromise that also increased service on the Red Line, on April 20, 2006 the WMATA board approved a Yellow Line extension to the Fort Totten station during off-peak hours. An 18-month pilot <b>program</b> <b>began</b> on December 31, 2006, at a cost of $5.75 million to the District of Columbia. The pilot program was made a permanent service.|$|E

5|$|The Great Depression {{and lack}} of {{outreach}} to Wisconsinites and UW faculty led to the college's slow decline. Enrollment decreased every year since the <b>program</b> <b>began,</b> which its statewide reputation exacerbated. After his son was expelled in 1931 by dean and Experimental College critic George Sellery, Meiklejohn recommended the college's dissolution. Public criticism of the college included student radicalism, lack of discipline, administrative issues, and financial issues. Meiklejohn wrote a retrospective of the college, which philosopher John Dewey reviewed favorably and noted for its contribution to educational philosophy. University of Wisconsin faculty and regents voted to dissolve the college in May 1932. Some advisers stayed {{to teach in the}} university, and Meiklejohn remained briefly before moving to Berkeley. The Experimental College influenced programs internal to the university, and was the precursor to its Integrated Liberal Studies undergraduate program.|$|E
5|$|The {{football}} team at Georgetown was first formed on November 1, 1874, with the earliest recorded games dating to 1887. By the 1940s, Georgetown {{had one of}} the better college {{football team}}s in America, and played in the 1941 Orange Bowl, where they lost 147 to Mississippi State. As the college game became more expensive after World War II, however, Georgetown's <b>program</b> <b>began</b> to lose money rapidly. The Hoyas last successful season was 1949, when they lost in the Sun Bowl against Texas Western. However the program was losing too much money, and on March 22, 1951, the university's president canceled the football program.|$|E

In 2013, the program was again modified in part to bring it more in alignment with TRADOC policies, and to prepare it for Joint Professional Education II accreditation.

5|$|First {{deliveries}} {{began in}} March 1947 and a flight test <b>program</b> <b>began</b> that month that lasted {{three years before}} the major deficiencies identified were fully corrected. Carrier landing trials revealed a structural weakness of the rear fuselage when one aircraft was severed in half during a heavy landing. Severe vibrations in the tail upon engaging the arresting wire were cured by adding a roller bearing to the tailhook to counter the sideways forces placed on the tailhook. Other necessary changes were the addition of spoiler ailerons and an elevator control boost to improve the aircraft's poor controllability at low speeds. In addition, the cockpit layout was unsatisfactory {{and had to be}} redesigned. The NATC finally deemed the Mauler acceptable for carrier landings in August 1948 even though aircraft had been issued to one squadron earlier in the year and a new batch of 50 aircraft had been ordered in May. Despite all the modifications to the aircraft over its short life, it remained a maintenance nightmare, especially the leaky hydraulic systems.|$|E
