40|$|INTRODUCTION It {{is unclear}} {{as to whether}} human or long-acting analog insulins {{represent}} the most efficient use of health and non-healthcare resources {{in the management of}} type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the value for money relationship associated with the use of these insulins in the UK setting. METHODS A literature search was performed for studies reporting expenditure associated with the use of human and analog insulins. Data from this review informed a budget impact assessment model. Costs were converted to a common currency and results are reported in 2011 British <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> (<b>GBP)</b> values. RESULTS Annual diabetes-related medication expenditure and patients total expenditure associated with the management of T 2 DM were estimated to be £ 397 million and £ 3, 901 million, respectively. Substitution of human insulin for analog insulins was associated with a drug acquisition cost saving of between £ 5 million and £ 23 million each year. Overall, though, total expenditure increased significantly with increased use of human insulin by £ 34 million to £ 136 million each year depending on the degree of substitution. CONCLUSIONS On the face of it, analog insulins are more expensive, prompting questions about potential cost savings to health services in the UK from direct substitution to the less expensive human preparation. The current analysis illustrates that the increased use of human insulin and decreased use of analog insulin would, however, increase the overall net societal cost of managing insulin-treated patients with T 2 DM. Governments and decision makers should consider that total healthcare expenditure would not necessarily fall when decisions are based solely on the use of cheaper products.

40|$|UNLABELLED: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{estimate}} the cost-effectiveness of balloon kyphoplasty compared to nonsurgical management and vertebroplasty for the treatment of hospitalised osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures in the UK. A cost-effectiveness model was constructed and used for analysis. Balloon kyphoplasty may be cost-effective compared to relevant alternatives. INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) for the treatment of patients hospitalised with acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) compared to percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and nonsurgical management (NSM) in the UK. METHODS: A Markov simulation model was developed to evaluate treatment with BKP, NSM and PVP in patients with symptomatic OVCF. Data on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with acute OVCF were derived from the FREE and VERTOS II randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and normalised to the NSM arm in the FREE trial. Estimated differences in mortality among the treatments and costs for NSM were obtained from the literature whereas procedure costs for BKP and PVP were obtained from three National Health Service hospitals. It was assumed that BKP and PVP reduced hospital length of stay by 6  days compared to NSM. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated at Great Britain <b>Pound</b> <b>Sterling</b> (<b>GBP)</b> 2, 706 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and GBP 15, 982 per QALY compared to NSM and PVP, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness of BKP vs. NSM was robust when mortality and HRQoL benefits with BKP were varied. The cost-effectiveness of BKP compared to PVP was particularly sensitive to changes in the mortality benefit. CONCLUSION: BKP may be a cost-effective strategy for the treatment of patients hospitalised with acute OVCF in the UK compared to NSM and PVP. Additional RCT data on the benefits of BKP and PVP compared to simulated sham surgery and further data on the mortality benefits with BKP compared to NSM and PVP would reduce uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Falls {{among older}} people are of growing concern globally. Implementing {{cost-effective}} strategies for their prevention is of utmost importance given the ageing population and associated potential for increased costs of fall-related injury over the next decades. The {{purpose of this study}} was to undertake a cost-utility analysis and secondary cost-effectiveness analysis from a healthcare system perspective, of a group-based exercise program compared to routine care for falls prevention in an older community-dwelling population. METHODS: A decision analysis using a decision tree model was based on the results of a previously published randomised controlled trial with a community-dwelling population aged over 70. Measures of falls, fall-related injuries and resource use were directly obtained from trial data and supplemented by literature-based utility measures. A sub-group analysis was performed of women only. Cost estimates are reported in 2010 British <b>Pound</b> <b>Sterling</b> (<b>GBP).</b> RESULTS: The ICER of GBP£ 51, 483 per QALY for the base case analysis was well above the accepted cost-effectiveness threshold of GBP£ 20, 000 to £ 30, 000 per QALY, but in a sensitivity analysis with minimised program implementation the incremental cost reached GBP£ 25, 678 per QALY. The ICER value at 95 % confidence in the base case analysis was GBP£ 99, 664 per QALY and GBP£ 50, 549 per QALY in the lower cost analysis. Males had a 44 % lower injury rate if they fell, compared to females resulting in a more favourable ICER for the women only analysis. For women only the ICER was GBP£ 22, 986 per QALY in the base case and was below the cost-effectiveness threshold for all other variations of program implementation. The ICER value at 95 % confidence was GBP£ 48, 212 in the women only base case analysis and GBP£ 23, 645 in the lower cost analysis. The base case incremental cost per fall averted was GBP£ 652 (GBP£ 616 for women only). A threshold analysis indicates that this exercise program cannot realistically break even. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that this exercise program is cost-effective for women only. There is no evidence to support its cost-effectiveness in a group of mixed gender unless the costs of program implementation are minimal. Conservative assumptions may have underestimated the true cost-effectiveness of the program...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether, from {{a health}} provider and patient perspective, surgical stabilisation {{of the spine}} is cost effective when compared with an intensive programme of rehabilitation in patients with chronic low back pain. DESIGN: Economic evaluation alongside a pragmatic randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Secondary care. PARTICIPANTS: 349 patients randomised to surgery (n = 176) or to an intensive rehabilitation programme (n = 173) from 15 centres across the United Kingdom between June 1996 and February 2002. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs related to back pain and incurred by the NHS and patients up to 24 months after randomisation. Return to paid employment and total hours worked. Patient utility as estimated by using the EuroQol EQ- 5 D questionnaire at several time points and used to calculate quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost effectiveness was expressed as an incremental cost per QALY. RESULTS: At two years, 38 patients randomised to rehabilitation had received rehabilitation and surgery whereas just seven surgery patients had received both treatments. The mean total cost per patient {{was estimated to be}} 7830 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> (SD 5202 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling)</b> in the surgery group and 4526 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> (SD 4155 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling)</b> in the intensive rehabilitation arm, a significant difference of 3304 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> (95 % confidence interval 2317 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling</b> to 4291 <b>pounds</b> <b>sterling).</b> Mean QALYs over the trial period were 1. 004 (SD 0. 405) in the surgery group and 0. 936 (SD 0. 431) in the intensive rehabilitation group, giving a non-significant difference of 0. 068 (- 0. 020 to 0. 156).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although transfusion-transmitted {{infections are}} rare, non-infectious {{complications}} occur relatively frequently. Solvent/detergent-treated fresh-frozen plasma (SD-FFP) {{has been shown}} to reduce the frequency of both types of complication, although previous economic evaluations failed to consider non-infective events and subsequently underestimated the benefits of SD-FFP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A time-series analytical model was used to estimate the incremental cost/life year saved for SD-FFP compared with untreated FFP, having controlled for post-transfusion mortality and patient age. Various infective and non-infective transfusion-related complications were considered. RESULTS: The discounted cost/life year saved for SD-FFP use in the UK was <b>pound</b> <b>sterling</b> 22, 728 [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) : <b>pound</b> <b>sterling</b> 22, 604 - 22, 853] for neonates and <b>pound</b> <b>sterling</b> 98, 465 (95 % CI: <b>pound</b> <b>sterling</b> 97, 924 - 99, 005) for patients aged 70. The cost-effectiveness ratio was below <b>pound</b> <b>sterling</b> 50, 000 /life year saved for patients < or = 48 years of age, and below <b>pound</b> <b>sterling</b> 30, 000 /life year saved for those < or = 21 years of age. In transfusion recipients with no significant morbidity, the cost-effectiveness ratio was <b>pound</b> <b>sterling</b> 12, 335 for neonates and <b>pound</b> <b>sterling</b> 61, 692 for 70 -year olds. The most important driver of cost-effectiveness was transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), on account of its relatively high incidence and mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Previous analyses greatly underestimated the cost-effectiveness of SD-FFP. Inclusion of non-infectious complications suggests that SD-FFP is cost-effective in patients < or = 48 years of age and in older patients with good clinical prognosis, which may justify the wider use of this technology...|$|R
