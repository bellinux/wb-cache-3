50|$|Although most Rubiaceae {{species are}} hermaphroditic, {{outbreeding}} is promoted through <b>proterandry</b> and spatial {{isolation of the}} reproductive organs. More complex reproductive strategies include secondary pollen presentation, heterodistyly, and unisexual flowers.Secondary pollen presentation (also known as stylar pollen presentation or ixoroid pollen mechanism) is especially known from the Gardenieae and related tribes. The flowers are proterandrous and the pollen is shed early onto {{the outside of the}} stigmas and/or {{the upper part of the}} style, which serve as a 'receptaculum pollinis'. Increased surface area and irregularity of the pollen receptacle, caused by swellings, hairs, grooves or ridges often ensure a more efficient pollen deposition. After elongation of the style, animals transport the pollen to flowers in the female or receptive stage with exposed stigmatic surfaces. A pollen catapult mechanism is present in the genera Molopanthera and Posoqueria (tribe Posoquerieae) that projects a spherical pollen mass onto visiting sphingidae.Heterodistyly is another mechanism to avoid inbreeding and is widely present in the Rubiaceae family. The tribes containing the largest number of heterostylous species are Spermacoceae and Psychotrieae. Heterostyly is absent in groups that have secondary pollen presentation (e.g. Vanguerieae).Unisexual flowers also occur in Rubiaceae and most taxa that have this characteristic are dioecious. The two flower morphs are however difficult to observe as they are rather morphologically similar; male flowers have a pistillode with the ovaries empty and female flowers have empty, smaller anthers (staminodes). Flowers that are morphologically hermaphrodite, but functionally dioecious are for example found in Pyrostria.|$|E
40|$|When {{investigating}} drought tolerance, it {{must not}} be forgotten that drought stress is a complex phenomenon exhibiting quite different characters in different years and locations. For this reason, the plant response to drought is also a complex process. In our study, 83 maize hybrids originating from various countries were investigated {{over a period of}} two years, under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions. The drought tolerance of plants in the non-irrigated plots was analysed in terms of flowering synchrony and yield components. It could be concluded from the results that in response to long-term water deficit the period between tasselling and silking became longer, while the analysis of yield components revealed the greatest reductions in the number of kernels per ear and in the proportion of seed set. As the degree of <b>proterandry</b> increased, there was a decline in the grain yield, confirming that the analysis of this trait could be a way of predicting drought tolerance. Considerable differences in drought tolerance were observed between the genetic materials included in the analysis, suggesting the presence among these parental lines and hybrids of genotypes resistant to long-term water deficit, suitable for cultivation under dry conditions. An analysis of correlations between the traits revealed that <b>proterandry</b> should be treated as a priority trait when investigating drought stress tolerance, as better predictions can be made of both drought tolerance and potential yields, leading to more reliable selection for higher yields...|$|E
40|$|Population {{dynamics}} {{studies in}} insects mostly {{focus on a}} specific life stage of a species and seldom consider different stages. In the framework of our research we studied the population demography of a protected Maculinea alcon 'cruciata' population and the factors that could influence the distribution of eggs. The results of the markrecapture survey showed a relatively short flight period between mid-June and midJuly with clearly marked early peak period. Unlike in many other butterflies, <b>proterandry</b> was not strong. The total population of M. alcon 'cruciata' was estimated at 699 individuals. The survival rate, and consequently the average life span, was relatively low. Generally, males {{proved to be more}} mobile than females. Eggs showed a highly aggregated pattern, and egg numbers was positively related to general shoot size, while the number of flower buds and the features of the surrounding vegetation did not display any effect on egg laying. Based on our findings the studied population appears viable, but specific management techniques could ensure optimal conditions for egg laying in this protected butterfly...|$|E
40|$|Flower {{development}} of protandrous species Malva sylvestris L. {{was divided into}} 12 stages, as revealed by applying histological and scanning electron microscope techniques. Flower development started with the conversion of apical meristem into floral meristem. Initiation of male organ primordia started before that of female organ. Five rounded structures called corolla/androecium units differentiated from floral meristem, on which stamen primordia emerged. When pollen mother cells exist in the pollen sacs, initiation of carpels starts from floral meristem. Concurrent with the termination of meiosis in pollen mother cells, ten loculed ovary comed in view. Simultaneously with the occurrence of vacuoleted pollen grains, megaspore mother cell becomes visible in the nucellar tissue. Concominant with the existence of two celled-pollen grains, the style was formed and ovule becomes anatropous. When pollen grains are shed in male phase, ten branched stigma appeared on {{the upper part of}} the style, but receptive surface was not fully formed to accept pollen grains. Female phase is characterized by the opening of stigmatic branches with papillate receptive surface. Timing of reproductive organs maturity overlapped for a while, thus, the reproductive stragey of M. sylvestris was incomplete <b>proterandry...</b>|$|E
40|$|Campanula medium L. (Campanulaceae) is a {{biennial}} herb, {{endemic to}} Italy (NW Tuscany and Liguria) and SE France (Provence) (1). However, presently it is widespread as sub-spontaneous across Europe, {{probably due to}} its high ornamental interest as cut flower, with many existing cultivars. The plant is also protected in Tuscany, listed in the annex A of the regional law n° 56 / 2000. Given the high economical and local conservational interest of this species, we decided to investigate its pollination ecology, whose knowledge represents a crucial step to optimise cultivation and conservation plans. It {{is well known that}} Campanulaceae show secondary pollen presentation mechanism, in order to increase the accuracy of pollen capture and transfer by pollinators, and Campanula in particular shows also <b>proterandry</b> (2). Despite this, the pollination ecology of C. medium has never been investigated before. A natural population in the Apuan Alps (Tuscany, Massa Carrara) was investigated from June to September 2008. To determine the breeding system, four experimental treatments were applied on 48 randomly chosen flowers from 24 different individuals: (i) spontaneous self-pollination, to test autonomous self-pollination within a single flower, (ii) forced self-pollination and (iii) forced geitonogamy; (iv) forced xenogamy, to test for outcrossing ability. A control group (14 flowers freely exposed to environment) was selected. Each flower was marked and checked daily, to document flower senescence, fruit production and fruit seed set. According to (3), Index of Self-Incompatibility (ISI) and Index of Automatic Self-pollination (IAS) were calculated. In addition, the percentage of pollen limitation within the population was assessed as indicated in (4). We investigated secondary pollen presentation and the temporal dynamics of the sexual phases. Flowers in different flowering stages were randomly sampled in order to estimate pollen viability (by means of the tetrazolium assay, using MTT) and stigma receptivity (by means of Perex test) (5). Concerning stigma biology, its opening and receptivity were studied in relation to the presence of the pollen on the style. In addition, the pollinators and their behavior during the visits were recorded. The most representative ones were collected for identification. To test correlations and significant trends (p ≤ 0. 01), the Spearman Index and Kruskal-Wallis test were applied. Our study showed that C. medium is partially self-compatible, partially autogamous and mostly outcrossing. The fruit set from experimental xenogamy was higher than that resulting from controls, suggesting a pollen limitation in the population studied. <b>Proterandry</b> for the species is confirmed: male and female phases were clearly separated and the presence of pollen on the style affects negatively the receptivity and the opening speed of the stigma. In addition, our study highlighted that the time of anthesis was longer in plants with a self-pollination treatment (14. 13 ± 4. 32 days) than plants subject to xenogamy (4. 15 ± 1. 52). This delay in flower senescence, probably due to a lower production of ethylene (6), could be an interesting issue concerning the knowledge of floral life span, {{which is one of the}} most important parameters in species of horticultural interest, and especially in cut flowers. The most frequent visiting insects, which can be regarded as putative pollinators, were bees belonging to Apoidea, such as Apis mellifera L., Bombus terrestris (L.), Xylocopa violacea (L.) and Anthidium sp.; Curculionidae were also observed as pollen foragers...|$|E
