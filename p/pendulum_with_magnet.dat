40|$|We {{consider}} two forced dissipative pendulum systems, the <b>pendulum</b> <b>with</b> vertically oscillating {{support and}} the <b>pendulum</b> <b>with</b> periodically varying length, {{with a view to}} draw comparisons between their behaviour. We study the two systems for values of the parameters for which the dynamics are non-chaotic. We focus our investigation on the persisting attractive periodic orbits and their basins of attraction, utilising both analytical and numerical techniques. Although in some respect the two systems have similar behaviour, we find that even within the perturbation regime they may exhibit different dynamics. In particular, for the same value of the amplitude of the forcing, the <b>pendulum</b> <b>with</b> varying length turns out to be perturbed to a greater extent. Furthermore the periodic attractors persist under larger values of the damping coefficient in the <b>pendulum</b> <b>with</b> varying length. Finally, unlike the <b>pendulum</b> <b>with</b> oscillating support, the <b>pendulum</b> <b>with</b> varying length cannot be stabilised around the upward position for any values of the parameters...|$|R
