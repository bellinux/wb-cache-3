5|$|Thomas Kretschmann as Captain Englehorn, the German {{captain of}} the Venture. Englehorn shows a dislike for Denham, <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> of his obsessive nature.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Licancabur was first settled by the Atacameno people, <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> {{of the water}} in local canyons. The Incas, under Yawar Waqaq, were {{followed}} by the Spanish during the early 16th century in the region; both were looking for yareta and chinchillas.|$|E
5|$|By some accounts, Smith {{had been}} {{teaching}} a polygamy doctrine {{as early as}} 1831, and there is unconfirmed evidence that Smith was a polygamist by 1835. Although the church had publicly repudiated polygamy, in 1837 there was a rift between Smith and Oliver Cowdery over the issue. Cowdery suspected Smith had engaged {{in a relationship with}} his serving girl, Fanny Alger. Smith never denied a relationship, but insisted it was not adulterous, <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> he had taken Alger as a plural wife.|$|E
50|$|A {{recent survey}} {{detected}} a steep decline {{in part of}} the Japanese breeding population which has <b>presumably</b> occurred <b>because</b> of forest loss and degradation in its winter range.|$|R
50|$|The {{waterfall}} {{is located}} {{less than a}} quarter mile from Angeline Falls, and shares the same cliff with it. Big Heart Lake was <b>presumably</b> named <b>because</b> of its roughly heart shaped surface.|$|R
5000|$|The alliterative name Bijlmerbajes was <b>presumably</b> {{acquired}} <b>because</b> {{the tower}} complex was constructed {{at the same}} time as highrise construction in the neighbouring Bijlmermeer, with bajes a Dutch slang term for [...] "prison".|$|R
5|$|LDLR {{mutations}} {{are more}} common in certain populations, <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> of a genetic phenomenon known as the founder effect—they were founded by {{a small group of}} individuals, one or several of whom was a carrier of the mutation. The Afrikaner, French Canadians, Lebanese Christians, and Finns have high rates of specific mutations that make FH particularly common in these groups. APOB mutations {{are more common}} in Central Europe.|$|E
5|$|Subordinate to the MVM {{were all}} the diocesan comitatus commanders in the West: Gaul, Britannia, Illyricum (West), Africa, Tingitania and Hispania. In {{contrast}} to their eastern counterparts, who all held magister militum rank, the commanders of the Western regional comitatus were all of the lower comes rei militaris ("military count") rank, save for the magister equitum per Gallias. This was <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> all but the Gaul comitatus were smaller than the 20–30,000 typically commanded by a magister militum.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of Flammen's death was challenged by Danish National Archives's Peter Birkelund. In the film Flammen commits suicide {{in the basement}} of his house after the Gestapo find him, <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> of Ketty's betrayal. Birkelund, however, says Flammen was killed on a coastal road while the Gestapo was looking for another resistance member. In contrast, the filming of Citron's death, which would require 250 soldiers, was consciously altered by Madsen for budgetary reasons.|$|E
30|$|The {{technology}} risk is near zero <b>because</b> <b>presumably</b> {{the original}} inventor has proven it out.|$|R
50|$|Some {{time later}} Titanium Man was seen being beaten {{down by the}} Protector. The {{identity}} of this Titanium Man or {{the circumstances of the}} battle remain undisclosed, but he is <b>presumably</b> Bullski, <b>because</b> he was wearing that version of the armor.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Carmeltown', <b>presumably</b> {{so-called}} <b>because</b> of {{the presence}} of Carmel Chapel, lies between the Rassau and the rest of Beaufort. Confusingly, the 'rest of Beaufort' (i.e. geographically the eastern part of Beaufort) is frequently simply referred to as 'Beaufort' or 'Beaufort Hill'.|$|R
5|$|The {{directors}} cited influences such as {{the television}} series In Search of..., and horror documentary films Chariots of the Gods and The Legend of Boggy Creek. Other influences included commercially successful horror films such as The Shining, Alien, and The Omen. Jaws was an influence as well, <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> the witch was hidden from the viewer for {{the entirety of the}} film, forcing suspense from the unknown.|$|E
5|$|Captained by Commander Geoffrey Layton, her post-completion trials {{lasted for}} five months as {{she was used to}} {{evaluate}} steam power for submarine use. Much was learned about the operation of steam submarines, which helped the subsequent design of the steam-powered K-class fleet submarines. She proved to be very unstable while surfacing, <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> she could not pump the water out of her controlled free-flooding spaces quickly enough in the upper part of her double hull. These problems, coupled with {{the fact that she was}} too slow to work with the fleet as originally envisioned, meant that she was impossible to make into an effective warship, and she was laid up after her trials.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondrial genomes {{have far}} fewer genes than the {{bacteria}} {{from which they}} {{are thought to be}} descended. Although some have been lost altogether, many have been transferred to the nucleus, such as the respiratory complex II protein subunits. This is thought to be relatively common over evolutionary time. A few organisms, such as the Cryptosporidium, actually have mitochondria that lack any DNA, <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> all their genes have been lost or transferred. In Cryptosporidium, the mitochondria have an altered ATP generation system that renders the parasite resistant to many classical mitochondrial inhibitors such as cyanide, azide, and atovaquone.|$|E
50|$|The Witty worm {{incident}} was {{unique in that}} the worm spread very rapidly after announcement of the ISS vulnerability (a day later), and infected a much smaller and <b>presumably</b> harder-to-infect (<b>because</b> the administrators had taken security measures) host population than previous worms.|$|R
50|$|When R Tait McKenzie died {{he hoped}} to have his heart buried beneath this memorial, and this <b>presumably</b> either <b>because</b> he {{considered}} this his best work or also perhaps on account of a belief in its general significance in relation to First World War memorials in general and in particular perhaps the directly related Scottish National War Memorial.|$|R
50|$|To date no {{large scale}} testing has been {{performed}} on this concept. <b>Presumably</b> this is <b>because</b> the increased {{cost of the}} reflectors and cooling generally is not economically justified.|$|R
5|$|Numerous {{species of}} benthic foraminifera became extinct during the K–Pg {{extinction}} event, <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> {{they depend on}} organic debris for nutrients, since the biomass in the ocean {{is thought to have}} decreased. As the marine microbiota recovered, however, it is thought that increased speciation of benthic foraminifera resulted from the increase in food sources. Phytoplankton recovery in the early Paleocene provided the food source to support large benthic foraminiferal assemblages, which are mainly detritus-feeding. Ultimate recovery of the benthic populations occurred over several stages lasting several hundred thousand years into the early Paleocene.|$|E
5|$|The American Pacific Northwest {{became a}} {{frequent}} site for {{games in the}} 1950s and 1960s. Western Canadian teams, particularly the BC Lions, were most {{often called upon to}} entertain their regional neighbours. News reports from the time suggest a hybrid game of three down Canadian ball played on the more restricted 100 yard American field. One BC–Winnipeg matchup in 1960 was held not on the west coast but in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> both teams had a number of former University of Iowa stars, including Willie Mitchell, who scored the Lions' only touchdown in a 13–7 loss in front of 12,583.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the remiges (and alulae) of nestling hoatzins is much delayed compared to the {{development of}} these feathers in other young birds, <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> young hoatzins are equipped with claws on their first two digits. They use these small rounded hooks to grasp branches when clambering about in trees, and feathering on these digits would presumably interfere with that functionality. Most youngsters shed their claws sometime between their 70th and 100th day of life, but some retain them— though callused-over and unusable— into adulthood.|$|E
40|$|A 34 -year-old male {{receiving}} chronic {{parenteral nutrition}} {{for treatment of}} short bowel syndrome and intermittent immunosuppressive agents for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis developed recurrent, catheter-associated Rhodotorula rubra fungemia over a one-year period. Infection with this yeast is associated with insertion of central venous catheters. Recurrence of R. rubra infection is an unusual event that <b>presumably</b> occurred <b>because</b> of chronic skin colonization by the organism...|$|R
5000|$|Deka Moni (デカモニ。) was a Japanese group {{consisting}} of one member, volleyball player Motoko Obayashi, <b>presumably</b> chosen <b>because</b> of her height. She appears four {{times on the}} single cover {{to give the impression}} of a group with four members. Although Deka Moni is not a part of Hello! Project, Tsunku produced the single, which features a cover of Minimoni's [...] "Jankenpyon!" [...] as its c/w track.|$|R
30|$|The {{market risk}} is less <b>because</b> <b>presumably</b> the {{original}} inventor has successfully commercialized the product or service. Adapting {{the product to}} a new market in a new geography still does entail some risk.|$|R
5|$|Churchill did {{not support}} the government, however. In July, he had advised the King's legal counsel, Walter Monckton, against the divorce, but his advice was ignored. As soon as the affair became public knowledge, Churchill started to {{pressure}} Baldwin and the King to delay any decisions until parliament and the people had been consulted. In a private letter to Geoffrey Dawson, the editor of The Times newspaper, Churchill suggested that a delay would be beneficial because, given time, the King might fall out of love with Simpson. Baldwin rejected the request for delay, <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> he preferred to resolve the crisis quickly. Supporters of the King alleged a conspiracy between Baldwin, Geoffrey Dawson, and Cosmo Gordon Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The royal physician Bertrand Dawson was possibly involved in a plan to force the prime minister to retire on the grounds of heart disease, but he eventually accepted, on the evidence of an early electrocardiograph, that Baldwin's heart was sound.|$|E
5|$|In {{the regions}} (e.g. various regions within North America) where low {{selenium}} soil levels lead to low {{concentrations in the}} plants, some animal species may be deficient unless selenium is supplemented with diet or injection. Ruminants are particularly susceptible. In general, absorption of dietary selenium is lower in ruminants than other animals, and is lower from forages than from grain. Ruminants grazing certain forages, e.g., some white clover varieties containing cyanogenic glycosides, may have higher selenium requirements, <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> cyanide is released from the aglycone by glucosidase activity in the rumen and glutathione peroxidases is deactivated by the cyanide acting on the glutathione moiety. Neonate ruminants at risk of white muscle disease may be administered both selenium and vitamin E by injection; some of the WMD myopathies respond only to selenium, some only to vitamin E, and some to either.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, both Marge and Mr. Burns want Homer {{to go on}} {{the same}} rafting trip. Homer starts with being on his family's raft, and then swims back and forth between that and Mr. Burns's raft. Marge discovers that he has double booked the weekend while both rafts float near a waterfall, and is upset that he chose to do work on a family outing. Homer can only save one raft, and he saves the one {{containing}} his family. As Mr. Burns and the executives are about to go over the waterfall, Marlowe rides up on a motorboat and carries Mr. Burns to safety, while the executives fall over the edge. Homer goes over the waterfall by himself, but is completely unharmed and finds gold. Later, at their house, Homer tells Marge that he is a safety inspector again. Fireworks go off outside, and it is revealed that they were caused by a fire at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> Homer failed at his job.|$|E
50|$|GameMaker is {{distinguished}} by some notable boundaries; some {{imposed by the}} Commodore 64 architecture, some by the software itself — <b>presumably</b> in part <b>because</b> of the large memory footprint of the user interface.|$|R
40|$|Reports of sandalwood, Santalum sp., {{being present}} on Rarotonga {{in the early}} part of the nineteenth century are <b>presumably</b> incorrect, <b>because</b> no {{specimens}} from there have ever been found. However, sandalwood does grow on Mitiaro to the northeast and is here named as a new variety of S. insulare Bert. Within this widespread French Polynesian species the Cook Island plant is closest to the type variety from the Society Islands...|$|R
5|$|The Alpine chough lays its eggs {{about one}} month later than its relative, {{although}} breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species <b>presumably</b> arose <b>because</b> of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour. The first-year survival rate of the juvenile red-billed chough is 72.5 percent, and for the Alpine it is 77%. The annual adult survival rate is 83–92% for Alpine, but is unknown for red-billed.|$|R
5|$|The {{city was}} {{captured}} by Crusaders in 1099, {{under the command of}} Prince Tancred, and renamed Naples. Though the Crusaders extorted many supplies from the population for their troops who were en route to Jerusalem, they did not sack the city, <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> of the large Christian population there. Nablus became part of the royal domain of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Muslim, Eastern Orthodox Christian, and Samaritan populations remained in the city, and were joined by some Crusaders who settled therein {{to take advantage of the}} city's abundant resources. In 1120, the Crusaders convened the Council of Nablus out of which was issued the first written laws for the kingdom. They converted the Samaritan synagogue in Nablus into a church. The Samaritan community built a new synagogue in the 1130s.|$|E
5|$|The first {{polio vaccine}} was the inactivated polio vaccine. It was {{developed}} by Jonas Salk and came into use in 1955. The oral polio vaccine {{was developed by}} Albert Sabin and came into commercial use in 1961. They are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. Clinical disease, including paralysis, caused by vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is indistinguishable from that caused by wild polioviruses. This is believed to be a rare event, but outbreaks of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), caused by a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), have been reported, and tend to occur in areas of low coverage by OPV, <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> the OPV is itself protective against the related outbreak strain.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood. Most {{studies have focused on}} the mating-type region in fission yeast, which may not be representative of activities in other genomic regions/organisms. In maintenance of existing heterochromatin regions, RITS forms a complex with siRNAs complementary to the local genes and stably binds local methylated histones, acting co-transcriptionally to degrade any nascent pre-mRNA transcripts that are initiated by RNA polymerase. The formation of such a heterochromatin region, though not its maintenance, is dicer-dependent, <b>presumably</b> <b>because</b> dicer is required to generate the initial complement of siRNAs that target subsequent transcripts. Heterochromatin maintenance has been suggested to function as a self-reinforcing feedback loop, as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional nascent transcripts by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes. The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to mammals is not clear, as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of the components of the RNAi pathway.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} Italian Alps, the Alpine chough nests {{in a greater}} variety of sites than red-billed chough, using natural cliffs, pot-holes and {{abandoned}} buildings, whereas the red-billed uses only natural cliffs (although it nests in old buildings elsewhere). The Alpine chough lays its eggs about one month later than its relative, although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species <b>presumably</b> arose <b>because</b> of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour.|$|R
