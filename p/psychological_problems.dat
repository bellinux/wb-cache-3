40|$|The main {{discussion}} of this thesis is the <b>psychological</b> <b>problem</b> namely inferiority complex found in Mary Thorne, the main female character in Anthony Trollope?s Doctor Thorne. The thesis writer finds that Mary has some symptoms of <b>psychological</b> <b>problem</b> in her character traits, she, therefore, wants to analyze Mary?s <b>psychological</b> <b>problem.</b> The statement {{of this study is}} to find out the possibility of Mary?s <b>psychological</b> <b>problem.</b> as well as the causes behind her <b>psychological</b> <b>problem.</b> The purpose {{of this study is to}} prove that Mary has <b>psychological</b> <b>problem</b> namely inferiority complex as seen from her character traits and also to trace the possible causes of her inferiority complex. With the help of psychological theory of inferiority complex, the thesis writer tries to analyze <b>psychological</b> <b>problem</b> depicted in the novel. The analysis clarifies that inferiority complex is caused by some complicated causes. It may stem from childhood, which is stimulated by some environmental influences. In the case of Mary Thorne, her inferiority complex is much influenced by her family background and community. Significantly, Mary?s inferiority complex starts firstly from the rejection toward her birth. She begins to have inferior feelings yet she still realizes that she is worthy as God?s creature. Mary, then, experiences community?s disapprovals regarding her low birth. Those community?s disapprovals establish Mary?s inferiority complex in which she cannot overcome her inferior feelings anymore. Therefore, Mary Thorne becomes a submissive girl. In addition of her submissive attitude, Mary Thorne becomes over sensitive and seclusive. Her inferior feeling is actually understandable. However, it becomes problem when her inferior feelings change into inferiority complex in which she has exaggerated feeling of inferiority. As a result, Mary?s inferiority complex gives some significant impacts upon her character traits and leads her to behavioral disorder. The thesis writer finally concludes that all of Mary`s character traits are the portrayal of Mary?s inferiority complex...|$|R

5|$|For Halloween II, Zombie {{decided to}} focus more on the {{connection}} between Laurie and Michael, and the idea they share similar <b>psychological</b> <b>problems.</b> Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. For the characters of Halloween II, it is about change. Zombie wanted to look at how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to show the connection between Laurie and Michael, and provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. When it came time to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include John Carpenter's original Halloween theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's remake, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{the outcome}} for acute {{low back pain}} is positive. Pain and {{disability}} usually improve {{a great deal in}} the first six weeks, with complete recovery reported by 40 to 90%. In those who still have symptoms after six weeks, improvement is generally slower with only small gains up to one year. At one year, pain and disability levels are low to minimal in most people. Distress, previous low back pain, and job satisfaction are predictors of long-term outcome after an episode of acute pain. Certain <b>psychological</b> <b>problems</b> such as depression, or unhappiness due to loss of employment may prolong the episode of low back pain. Following a first episode of back pain, recurrences occur in more than half of people.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of factitious disorders in online venues is made easier by {{the availability of}} medical literature on the Internet, the anonymous and malleable nature of online identities, {{and the existence of}} communication forums established {{for the sole purpose of}} giving support to members facing significant health or <b>psychological</b> <b>problems.</b> Several high-profile cases have demonstrated behavior patterns which are common among those who pose as gravely ill or as victims of violence, or whose deaths are announced to online forums. The virtual communities that were created to give support, as well as general non-medical communities, often express genuine sympathy and grief for the purported victims. When fabrications are suspected or confirmed, the ensuing discussion can create schisms in online communities, destroying some and altering the trusting nature of individual members in others.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to {{classify}} low back pain with no consensus that any one method is best. There are three general types of low back pain by cause: mechanical back pain (including nonspecific musculoskeletal strains, herniated discs, compressed nerve roots, degenerative discs or joint disease, and broken vertebra), non-mechanical back pain (tumors, inflammatory conditions such as spondyloarthritis, and infections), and referred pain from internal organs (gallbladder disease, kidney stones, kidney infections, and aortic aneurysm, among others). Mechanical or musculoskeletal problems underlie most cases (around 90% or more), and of those, most (around 75%) do not have a specific cause identified, but are thought to be due to muscle strain or injury to ligaments. Rarely, complaints of low back pain result from systemic or <b>psychological</b> <b>problems,</b> such as fibromyalgia and somatoform disorders.|$|E
