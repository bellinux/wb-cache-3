Teachers select them to develop language and to teach sound-symbol relationships. Illustrators and authors of <b>alphabet</b> <b>books,</b> however, continue to violate the criteria for these books established by Huck and Kuhn. According to Huck and Kuhn, a good <b>alphabet</b> <b>book</b> should have: 1. One or two easily identifiable objects [...] objects meaningful for the age level of the child for whom the book was written [...] should be presented on a page. 2. Objects such as rabbit, having several correct names, should be avoided. 3. The common sounds of the letters rather than the blends, digraphs, and silent letters should be utilized...|$|R

50|$|The runology pioneer Johannes Bureus was a {{religious}} Christian, {{but he also}} thought that the Christian influence had replaced the runic alphabet with the Latin alphabet. His good reputation and his influential friends enabled him to acquire the royal privilege that no <b>alphabet</b> <b>books</b> could be printed without teaching the runic alphabet {{and no one was}} allowed to print them but himself. The result was that the first Swedish <b>alphabet</b> <b>book</b> ever printed had the purpose of teaching runes.|$|R
5000|$|Writing {{based on}} Latin graphemes was {{introduced}} in 1932 (an <b>alphabet</b> <b>book</b> and arithmetic textbook were published).

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{newspapers}} Bosanski vjestnik, Bosna, and Sarajevski cvjetnik, the Vilayet Printing House published around fifty books and booklets in Serbo-Croatian, Ottoman Turkish, and Hebrew. While {{most of these}} publications were concerned with various Ottoman laws and legislation, the printing house also published a number of textbooks. The textbooks for Serb elementary schools in the vilayet were prepared by Miloš Mandić {{on the basis of}} those that were used in Serbia. These include an <b>alphabet</b> <b>book</b> (Буквар), a short Biblical history (Кратка свештена историја), a basal reader (Прва читанка), and the First Knowledges (Прва знања); they were published in 1867 and 1868. Mandić's <b>alphabet</b> <b>book,</b> the printing house's first textbook, was the second Serbian <b>alphabet</b> <b>book</b> using the reformed Serbian Cyrillic. The First Serbian <b>Alphabet</b> <b>Book</b> (Први Српски Буквар), authored by Vuk Karadžić, had been published in Vienna in 1827. The original plan was to print fifteen textbooks for Serb schools, ranging in subject from grammar, arithmetic, geography and religious teaching, but only four were printed. Although they were based on the textbooks used in Serbia, the vilayet's authorities made sure that every mention of Serbs and the Serbian language was erased from them.|$|R
