40|$|International audienceAccidental {{exposure}} to hazelnut or peanut constitutes {{a real threat}} {{to the health of}} hazelnut or peanut allergic consumers. Correct information regarding the ingredients of food products is of paramount importance to inform the consumer and thereby reducing the {{exposure to}} food allergens. For this study we have purchased 569 cookies and chocolates on the European market. All products were analysed to determine their peanut and hazelnut content allowing a comparison of the analytical results with the information provided on the label of those food products. Compared to cookies, chocolates are more likely to contain undeclared allergens, while in both food categories hazelnut traces were detected at higher frequencies than peanut. The presence of a <b>precautionary</b> <b>label</b> was found to be related to a higher frequency of positive test results. The majority of chocolates carrying a <b>precautionary</b> <b>label</b> tested positive for hazelnut, whereas in three quarters of the cookies carrying a <b>precautionary</b> <b>label</b> peanut traces could not be detected...|$|E

40|$|There is {{no current}} cure for food allergy; {{therefore}} consumers with food allergy rely on accurate and {{detailed information on}} food labels {{in order to prevent}} an adverse reaction. Manufacturers cannot guarantee that food products are free from allergens as cross contamination can occur in several situations including but not limited to raw materials, the actual premises, storage and distribution, manufacturing processes and cleaning procedures. In order to alert the allergic consumer to the possible presence of trace allergens, manufacturers have voluntarily added <b>precautionary</b> <b>labelling</b> to processed foods. There are several variations to these statements, for example: “may contain traces of”, “may be present “and “made on the same production line”. The main purpose of this thesis is to understand the role of <b>precautionary</b> <b>labelling</b> in the care of children with food allergies...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>precautionary</b> <b>labelling</b> remains high. This prevalence restricts food choices, {{in some cases}} perhaps unnecessarily, for food allergic consumers. During processing, cross-contamination does often occur in food products due to the way that modern processing facilities operate; however, zero risk of cross contamination is not a realistic expectation. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} threshold levels below which reactions are not provoked in allergic individuals do exist and these have been established in the literature for peanuts. Additional information such as understanding threshold levels will be important to this field of research. The data that will be obtained from future clinical trials will help to underpin action plans for <b>precautionary</b> <b>labelling.</b> This paper will review the current literature that is available regarding: consumer behaviour and attitudes regarding precautionary labelling; risk to the consumer and analytical results of products that bear advisory labelling; the current debate regarding whether a tolerable level of risk can be obtained in food allergy; and finally, the newly introduced Voluntary Incidental Trace Allergen Labelling (VITAL) system operating in Australia...|$|R
40|$|This article reviews current European {{legislation}} concerning allergens {{and their}} labelling, {{in particular in}} relation to the need to optimise consumer protection and {{improve the quality of life}} of food allergic consumers. Adequate communication concerning the presence of (potentially) allergenic ingredients is, for susceptible individuals, essential if intake of these hazardous ingredients is to be avoided. European food labelling legislation requires pre-packaged foodstuffs to be labelled with a list of ingredients, including a reference to allergens. However, some food products and ingredients are excluded from these labelling requirements. These exceptions may represent hazards for food allergic individuals. In order to contribute to a higher level of consumer protection some issues which have potential to improve the existing European legislation have been identified. At the present time, food producers voluntarily use <b>precautionary</b> <b>labelling</b> to warn allergic consumers for the possible unintentional presence of allergens. An embedding of <b>precautionary</b> <b>labelling</b> in European legislation is advocated. To improve the readability of the information, European legislation should include some additional requirements. The information provision should be uniform at least across European Member States.

40|$|Food allergy {{appears to}} be on the rise with the current {{mainstay}} of treatment centred on allergen avoidance. Mandatory allergen labelling has improved the safety of food for allergic consumers. However an additional form of voluntary <b>labelling</b> (termed <b>precautionary</b> allergen <b>labelling)</b> has evolved {{on a wide range of}} packaged goods, in a bid by manufacturers to minimise risk to customers, and the negative impact on business that might result from exposure to trace amounts of food allergen present during cross-contamination during production. This has resulted in near ubiquitous utilisation of a multitude of different <b>precautionary</b> allergen <b>labels</b> with subsequent confusion amongst many consumers as to their significance. The global nature of food production and manufacturing makes harmonisation of allergen labelling regulations across the world a matter of increasing importance. Addressing inconsistencies across countries with regards to labelling legislation, as well as improvement or even banning of <b>precautionary</b> allergy <b>labelling</b> are both likely to be significant steps forward in improved food safety for allergic families.

40|$|Background There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} proliferation of <b>precautionary</b> <b>labeling</b> by manufacturers to mitigate the perceived risk from low-level contamination from allergens in food. This {{has resulted in a}} significant reduction in choice of potentially safe foods for allergic consumers. Objectives We aimed to establish reference doses for 11 commonly allergenic foods to guide a rational approach by manufacturers based on all publically available valid oral food challenge data. Methods Reference doses were developed from statistical dose-distribution modeling of individual thresholds of patients in a dataset of more than 55 studies of clinical oral food challenges. Sufficient valid data were available for peanut, milk, egg, and hazelnut to allow assessment of the representativeness of the data used. Results The data were not significantly affected by the heterogeneity of the study methodology, including little effect of age on results for those foods for which sufficient numbers of adult challenge data were available (peanut and hazelnut). Thus by combining data from all studies, the eliciting dose for an allergic reaction in 1 % of the population estimated for the following were 0. 2 mg of protein for peanut, 0. 1 mg for cow's milk, 0. 03 mg for egg, and 0. 1 mg for hazelnut. Conclusions These reference doses will form the basis of the revised Voluntary Incidental Trace Allergen Labeling (VITAL) 2. 0 thresholds now recommended in Australia. These new levels will enable manufacturers to apply credible <b>precautionary</b> <b>labeling</b> and provide increased consumer confidence in their validity and reliability, as well as improving consumer safety. © 2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology...|$|R

40|$|Background: For most {{allergenic}} foods, insufficient {{threshold dose}} information within the population restricts the advice on levels of unintended allergenic foods which should trigger <b>precautionary</b> <b>labeling</b> on prepackaged foods. Objective: We wanted to derive threshold dose distributions for major allergenic foods and to elaborate the protein doses {{at which a}} proportion of the allergic population is likely to respond. Methods: For 7 allergenic foods double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFCs) with a positive outcome for allergic reactions were selected from the clinical database of children routinely tested to diagnose food allergy at the University Medical Center Groningen. For each allergen 2 population threshold distributions were determined with the individual minimal eliciting dose and the preceding dose of each DBPCFC for objective symptoms and any symptom (either subjective or objective). Results: Individual positive DBPCFCs were available for peanut (n = 135), cow's milk (n = 93), hen's egg (n = 53), hazelnut (n = 28), and cashew nut (n = 31). Fewer children were challenged with soy (n = 10) or walnut (n = 13). Threshold dose distributions showed a good statistical and visual fit. The protein dose at which 5 % of the allergic population is likely to respond with objective reactions was 1. 6 mg for peanut, 1. 1 mg for cow's milk, 1. 5 mg for hen's egg, 7. 4 mg for cashew nut, and 0. 29 mg for hazelnut. Thresholds for any symptom were on average 2 to 6 times lower than for objective symptoms. The 95 % upper and lower confidence intervals of the threshold distributions were overlapping.

40|$|International audienceFood {{products}} can become contaminated with food allergens due to cross contact. <b>Precautionary</b> 'may contain' <b>labelling</b> may {{alert to the}} possible presence of an allergen but guidance for such labelling is lacking. As a result, allergy information on the packaging may not be reliable and allergic consumers {{may be at risk}} of allergic reactions after consuming unlabelled but indeed contaminated products. Recently, a cow's milk protein allergic patient experienced a severe allergic reaction to a dark chocolate product containing undeclared milk proteins. This case induced us to investigate to what extent allergen concentrations of unlabelled products reach levels that are of public health relevance. The concentrations of milk proteins in the complaint sample and a collection of products of other batches and brands purchased from different stores were determined. Together with appropriate threshold and food consumption data, the risks of allergic reactions and the severity of these reactions within the adult milk allergic population were determined by using probabilistic risk assessment techniques. The results show that milk protein concentrations in unlabelled products reach levels that may elicit allergic reactions in up to 68 % of the adult allergic consumers. Concentrations of allergens in unlabelled products could reach levels that are of public health relevance. Application of probabilistic risk assessment can be an aid in revealing the public health consequences of undeclared allergens in food, in risk management decision making and developing guidance in terms of risk-based concentration limits for <b>precautionary</b> <b>labelling...</b>|$|R

40|$|Four {{to eight}} percent of the {{population}} are estimated to be food-allergic. Most food allergies in adolescents and adults are acquired on the basis of cross-reaction to pollen allergens. Theses allergens are ubiquitous in the plant kingdom. Therefore pollen-allergic patients might acquire a multitude of different plant food allergies, and even react to novel foods to which they have never previously been exposed. A curative therapy for food allergy does not yet exist. Food-allergic patients have to rely on strict avoidance diets, The widespread use of industrially processed foods poses a general problem for food-allergic patients. Although the most frequent allergens must be declared openly in the list of ingredients, involuntary contamination with allergy-provoking compounds can occur. The <b>precautionary</b> <b>labelling</b> "may contain" is sometimes applied even if the chance of contamination is very low; on the other hand, foods not declared to contain possible traces of allergenic components may actually contain relevant amounts of allergenic proteins.

Allergen avoidance methodologies, monitoring of signs/ symptoms of allergic reactions, handling serious medication needs, and planning ahead for a potential emergency due to an accidental exposure can be demanding concerns to the patient/family.

40|$|Refined {{vegetable}} oils including refined peanut oil {{are widely used}} in foods. Due to shared production processes, refined non-peanut {{vegetable oils}} can contain residual peanut proteins. We estimated the predicted number of allergic reactions to residual peanut proteins using probabilistic risk assessment applied to several scenarios involving food products made with vegetable oils. Variables considered were: a) the estimated production scale of refined peanut oil, b) estimated cross-contact between refined vegetable oils during production, c) the proportion of fat in representative food products and d) the peanut protein concentration in refined peanut oil. For all products examined the predicted risk of objective allergic reactions in peanut-allergic users of the food products was extremely low. The number of predicted reactions ranged depending on the model {{from a high of}} 3 per 1000 eating occasions (Weibull) to no reactions (LogNormal). Significantly, all reactions were predicted for allergen intakes well below the amounts reported for the most sensitive individual described in the clinical literature.

40|$|Background: Sesame is a {{relevant}} food allergen in France. Compared to other allergens {{there is a}} lack of food challenge data and more data could help sesame allergy risk management. The aim of this study is to collect more sesame challenge data and investigate the most efficient food challenge method for future studies. Method: Records of patients at University Hospital in Nancy (France) with objective symptoms to sesame challenges were collected and combined with previously published data. An estimation of the sesame allergy population threshold was calculated based on individual NOAELs and LOAELs. Clinical dosing schemes at Nancy were investigated to see if the optimal protocol for sesame is currently used. Results: Fourteen patients (10 M/ 4 F, 22 ± 14. 85 years old) with objective symptoms were added to previously published data making a total of 35 sesame allergic patients. The most sensitive patient reacted to the first dose at challenge of 1. 02 mg sesame protein. The ED 05 ranges between 1. 2 and 4. 0 mg of sesame protein (Log-Normal, Log-Logistic, and Weibull models) and the ED 10 between 4. 2 and 6. 2 mg. The optimal food challenge dosing scheme for sesame follows semi-log dose increases from 0. 3 to 3000 mg protein. Conclusion: This article provides a valuable update to the existing clinical literature regarding sesame NOAELs and LOAELs. Establishment of a population threshold for sesame could help in increasing the credibility of <b>precautionary</b> <b>labelling</b> and decrease the costs associated with unexpected allergic reactions.

40|$|Accurate {{quantification}} of GM {{to ensure}} compliance with labelling thresholds, e. g. the EU limit of 0. 9 %, requires intensive sampling and stringently validated methods. This is normally targeted at bulk consignments {{at one of}} several critical stages of the food/feed chain post farm gate. However, at the field level, following introduction of GM co-existence regimes, instances may arise that pose possible breaches of co-existence rules, {{with the potential for}} high economic impact for producers if <b>precautionary</b> <b>labelling</b> is sanctioned. In such instances, a rapid on-, or near-site, quantitative method for use as a pre-harvest predictive decision tool for adventitious GM presence (AGMP) would be of use. To this end we have adapted a laboratory-based protocol for real-time quantification of the MON 810 GM event in maize kernels (using Taqman¿ technology) for on-site testing using the portable Cepheid SmartCyclerII instrument. The duplex RT-PCR method requires a basic support infrastructure (bench, electricity, small grain mill or blender, water bath and micro-centrifuge) and can be completed in 2 hours (excluding sampling). The adapted method was pre-validated through an international ring-trial in six EU collaborating laboratories (employing only specified portable equipment). Results showed that the adapted method as performed on the portable instrument complied with minimum assay performance requirements as defined by the European Network of GMO Laboratories (RSDr = 18. 5 %; RSDR = 32. 8; Bias = 26. 7 %). Coupled with an appropriate field sampling approach, this technology has the potential to form the basis of an on- or near-site predictive decision tool for pre-harvest MON 810 AGMP in maize production.

40|$|Summary: Food {{allergic}} {{patients have}} to deal with an avoidance diet. Confusing <b>labelling</b> terms or <b>precautionary</b> <b>labels</b> can result in misinterpretation and risk-taking behaviour. Even those patients that strictly adhere to their diet experience (sometimes severe) unexpected allergic reactions to food. The frequency, severity and causes of such reactions are unknown. The objective of this review was to describe the frequency, severity and causes of unexpected allergic reactions to food in food allergic patients aged > 12 years, in order to develop improved strategies to deal with their allergy. A systematic review was carried out by two researchers, in six electronic databases (CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, Medline, Psychinfo and Scopus). The search was performed with keywords relating to the frequency, severity and causes of unexpected allergic reactions to food. This resulted in 24 studies which met the inclusion criteria; 18 observational and six qualitative studies. This review shows that knowledge about the frequency of unexpected reactions is limited. Peanut, nuts, egg, fruit/vegetables and milk are the main causal foods. Severe reactions and even fatalities occur. Most reactions take place at home, but a significant number also take place when eating at friends' houses or in restaurants. Labelling issues, but also attitude and risky behaviour of patients can attribute to unexpected reactions. We conclude that prospective studies are needed to get more insight in the frequency, severity, quantity of unintended allergen ingested and causes of unexpected allergic reactions to food, to be able to optimize strategies to support patients in dealing with their food allergy. Although the exact frequency is not known, unexpected reactions to food occur in a significant number of patients and can be severe. For clinical practice, this means that patient education and dietary instructions are necessary. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R

40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in {{using data from}} oral food challenges (OFC) performed under medical supervision to assist in allergy risk management, both in industry (allergen risk management) (1) and in the clinical management of the allergic individual (2). Data relating to the minimum eliciting dose (MED) needed to trigger symptoms can inform the need for <b>precautionary</b> allergen <b>labelling</b> (PAL) on food (1). However, given that “zero risk” for food-allergic individuals is {{not considered to be}} a realistic proposition (3), {{it is also important to}} consider the severity of symptoms which might be experienced: for example, a pragmatic approach, using a level of exposure that causes only minimal, transient oral symptoms in under 1 % of the food-allergic population, may be acceptable to guide the use of PAL (4). However, there is often an assumption that individuals with a lower MED (i. e. who react to a lower doses of allergen) are at a greater risk of anaphylaxis (5) ...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{mandatory}} labelling legislation, major food allergens that commonly cause allergic reactions are declared on packaging. The usage of <b>precautionary</b> allergen <b>labelling</b> (PAL) on packaging is not regulated in all countries and the food industry uses various forms of ‘may contain’ labelling which firstly is often inconsistent and secondly over time may diminish the value of such advisory statements. Hence {{the aim of this}} paper is to review the current industry usage of PAL and to provide recommendations on future use that are of value to academic, policy makers, food industry and consumers. A case study example is used to illustrate the likely costs and benefits of improving the current PAL status by considering a ‘peanut-free’ product and calculation using the Voluntary Incidental Trace Allergen Labelling (VITAL) calculator. Governance such as addressing the inconsistent usage of PALs, promoting the harmonisation of language used in PALs, and improving PAL status to quantified PAL statements would be helpful to communicate risks to consumers so they can make informed choices when purchasing food products...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of clinically established DBPCFC minimal eliciting doses determined in food-allergic individuals is increasing and previous work has shown these {{data can be}} used to determine population based reference doses for allergen risk management. Despite the large amount of data for peanut, milk, egg and hazelnut, EU and US public health authorities have not established population thresholds for any of the allergenic foods. In the absence of regulatory guidance regarding thresholds, food producers have attempted to manage risk through the widespread application of <b>precautionary</b> “may contain” <b>labelling.</b> In turn, food-allergic consumer quality-of-life has decreased and some food-allergic individuals are ignoring these advisory statements...|$|R

40|$|<b>Precautionary</b> {{allergen}} <b>labelling</b> (PAL) {{was introduced}} by the food industry to help manage and communicate the possibility of reaction from the unintended presence of allergens in foods. However, in its current form, PAL is counter-productive for consumers with food allergies. This review aims to summarise the perspectives of all the key stakeholders (including clinicians, patients, food industry and regulators), {{with the aim of}} defining common health protection and risk minimisation goals. The lack of agreed reference doses, has resulted in inconsistent application of PAL by the food industry and in levels of contamination that prompt withdrawal action by enforcement officers. So there is a poor relationship between {{the presence or absence of}} PAL and actual reaction risk. This has led to a loss of trust in PAL, reducing the ability of consumers with food allergies to make informed choices. The result has been reduced avoidance, reduced quality of life and increased risk-taking by consumers who often ignore PAL. All contributing stakeholders agree that PAL must reflect actual risk. PAL should be transparent and consistent with rules underpinning decision-making process being communicated clearly to all stakeholders. The use of PAL should indicate the possible, unintended presence of an allergen in a consumed portion of a food product at or above any proposed action level. This will require combined work by all stakeholders to ensure everyone understands the approach, and its limitations. Consumers with food allergy then need to be educated to undertake individualised risk assessments in relation to any PAL present...|$|R
