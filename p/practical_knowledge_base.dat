40|$|The {{transgender}} community {{represents a}} highly marginalised {{portion of the}} Australian population, frequently experiencing discrimination, social isolation, and harm. This review explores literature informing Australian social work with transgender people. It {{highlights the importance of}} generating a transgender-positive discourse within Australian social work to effectively engage with and advocate for individuals with nontraditional gender identities. Key themes emerged from reviewing the literature related to the medical model, the mental health of transgender people, interdisciplinary and alternative transgender literature, minority status of transgender people, existing social work approaches to transgenderism, and Indigenous transgender literature. The views of transgender Australians are largely absent from the literature. However, the Australian transgender community's emerging voice and political activism highlights the potential for collaboration to {{play a significant role in}} the process of building a working knowledge base for social work. Based on the identified gaps in literature, in this paper we call for continued progress in developing a theoretical and <b>practical</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>base</b> that incorporates the lived experiences of transgender Australians.

Participants judged the relations between force exerted in kicking a soccer ball and variables that define the trajectory of the ball: launch angle, maximum height attained, and maximum distance reached. Judgements tended to conform to a simple heuristic that judged force tends to increase as maximum height and maximum distance increase, with launch angle not being influential. Support was also found for the converse prediction, that judged maximum height and distance tend to increase {{as the amount of}} force described in the kick increases. The observed judgemental tendencies did not resemble the objective relations, in which force is a function of interactions between the trajectory variables.

Aim: To assess the impact of the training on everyday practice of the participants at least six months’ post training. Material and methods: A cross-sectional descriptive survey was used to execute this study between April to May 2016. A self-administered questionnaire was used for this study. Questionnaires were distributed using SurveyMonkey®. Data were analyzed using SurveyMonkey® Analysis Tool and Microsoft Excel Sheet. Results: A total of 73 trainees from six different courses responded to the survey. Majority (76. 06 %) of all respondents were from tertiary facilities. The survey revealed a positive influence on the clinical practice of participants, on prescription patterns, diagnostic approaches, and case findings in the community. A number of new concepts such as “Doctors as Leaders” were learned by the participants with over 80 % of respondents desiring further trainings in leadership. Conclusion: The M-PACT courses had changed the knowledge base of the participants with more confident diagnosis, management and prescribing reported as a result.

40|$|In recent years, {{the demands}} for {{effectiveness}} and evidence in social work have increased in all work areas, including that of healthcare. This has sparked the discussion on concepts such as practical- and theoretical knowledge and their respective roles in social work. In the light of this, {{the purpose of this}} candidate thesis is to investigate healthcare social workers understanding of practical- and theoretical knowledge in the working process as well as their respective influence and importance. This candidate thesis is based on three interviews with social workers from different departments in Norrlands Universitetssjukhus in Umeå, Sweden.

A range of theories were identified as tools of theoretical knowledge and was said to develop mostly from studies and tutoring. The relationship competence, that is the ability to create a trusting and secure relationship with the patient, was referred to as practical knowledge which typically came with work experience.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of the contexts of teaching of four beginning teachers and of the ways of knowing, derived through lived experience, that enabled their interactions within these contexts during {{the first two years of}} their careers in New South Wales primary schools. Within this thesis there is a particular focus on the beginning teachers' interactions with parents as one of the multiple dimensions of context. Educational reform has advocated the participation of parents and the community in the school. Accordingly, recently devised competency frameworks of teaching have included expectations that the graduate will have developed an ability to work with parents and, as a beginning teacher, be able to develop close partnerships between home and school. These expectations of policy have become an element of the structural context of teaching, but the practice of the beginning teachers us also shaped by elements of the sociocultural and historical contexts of the school and class and by the biographical contexts of the teacher, the learners and their parents. The development of the knowledge and skills that support participation is limited within initial teacher education programs. The expectations found within a framework of teaching competencies provides a statement of the theory of teaching, representing a technical knowledge base for the profession. Its application in context becomes the <b>practical</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>base.</b> Here, communicative and critical knowledge based on lived experience come to supplement the technical foundations in shaping the practical work of a teacher in a particular context.

The principal ideally leads a team of professionals, guiding, supporting, and nurturing their development toward positive outcomes for Māori students including whānau engagement, to achieve this goal. In addition, s/he will ideally provide a framework of expectations, these being based on a theoretical and <b>practical</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>base</b> as well as values that inform decision making. Within the framework of Māori education, the dimension of whānau participation {{continues to be a}} dimension needing further exploration in terms of its potential contribution to positive academic, social and cultural achievements of students. The focus of this thesis is to explore the role of the principal as both the leader of staff and the wider school community to support and enhance Māori student achievement in mainstream schooling. Principals lead from their knowledge base and their underpinning attitudes. It is the interweaving of these two elements, how attitudes inform behaviours and how these discrete set of skills required for leadership foster successful whānau participation which will be developed. A role of the principal is to empower staff to take a leadership role. In terms of whānau participation, an area of the schooling process that continually needs fostering, principals set the direction for staff to develop relationships with the Māori community. The set of skills required to achieve this will be explored, expanded and reflected upon.

Currently, {{only a minority of}} all newly diagnosed peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) patients receive efficient and structured conservative treatment for their disease. The aim {{of this article is to}} introduce an innovative effective treatment model termed ClaudicatioNet. This concept was launched in The Netherlands as a means to combat treatment shortcomings and stimulate cohesion and collaboration between stakeholders. The overall goal of ClaudicatioNet is to stimulate quality and transparency of PAOD treatment by optimizing multidisciplinary health care chains on a national level. Improved quality is based on stimulating both a theoretical and <b>practical</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>base,</b> while eHealth and mHealth technologies are used to create clear insights of provided care to enhance quality control management, in addition these technologies can be used to increase patient empowerment, thereby increasing efficacy of PAOD treatment. This online community consists of a web portal with public and personal information supplemented with a mobile application. By connecting to these tools, a social community is created where patients can meet and keep in touch with fellow patients, while useful information for supervising health care professionals is provided. The ClaudicatioNet concept will likely create more efficient and cost-effective PAOD treatment by improving the quality of supervised training programs, extending possibilities and stimulating patient empowerment by using eHealth and mHealth solutions. A free market principle is introduced by introducing transparency to provided care by using objective and subjective outcome parameters. Cost-effectiveness can be achieved using supervised training programs, which may substitute for or postpone expensive invasive vascular interventions.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of ongoing learning for language teachers is {{to be aware of}} the possibilities that new technology tools might offer for language learning and to integrate technology, where appropriate, into teaching environments. Much of teachers’ <b>practical</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>base</b> in relation to new technology tools develops over time and through actual classroom use. This study investigated the skills and knowledge that experienced tertiary language teachers acquired through the process of using individual CMC technologies in the language learning classroom. The qualitative paradigm guided methodological choices in relation to data collection and analysis. Longitudinal interviews were conducted over a period of fourteen months with sixteen experienced tertiary language teachers, from five tertiary institutions in Australia and New Zealand. Results were analysed for content and in relation to a priori categories from the literature. The developing knowledge base of participants was also examined with respect to affordance theory (with particular reference to Dohn, 2009; 1979; Kirschner, 2002; Kirschner, Strijbos, Kreijns, & Beers, 2004; Norman, 1988, 1999). The findings identified two aspects of teacher learning not specifically mentioned in existing frameworks of CALL teacher knowledge (Compton, 2009; Hampel & Stickler, 2005; Hubbard & Levy, 2006 a). Firstly, teachers not only learned about their teaching, but acquired knowledge around supporting their students’ learning, and, secondly, they continued to develop their understandings of their teacher selves. The participants in the study all displayed a strong focus on supporting their students’ learning, both in relation to students’ learning about technology and to ways in which teachers were able to use specific tools to support students’ language learning. Further in-depth analysis of six of the participants’ interviews also demonstrated that ongoing learning included growing understandings of roles that would support students’ learning, such as learner trainer, facilitator and researcher, as well as an increased knowledge of themselves personally, as they developed their individual teaching style and increased their sense of self-efficacy and motivation. A final, and crucial, feature of the developing knowledge base of the participants in the study was in relation to perceiving and implementing the affordances of new tools. The term ‘learning affordance’ was coined to describe how teachers perceived possibilities for actions that would support their students’ learning. A typical progression was identified for the process by which language teachers learn to perceive and actualise affordances. As well, the findings suggest that teachers perceived different kinds of affordance around content (as students engaged in using the L 2 and learning about culture) and process (as students engaged in interaction, in developing affective aspects of learning, and also in developing more autonomy as learners). Finally, a framework is outlined that situates affordance as central to teachers’ implementation of technology in the classroom. Implications of the general findings of the thesis are discussed with reference to their significance for in-service teacher learning...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to design and develop a network of automated, distributed, living {{cell-based}} sensors, called CytoSensors. Their main role is to detect a variety of biological and chemical toxins. The system {{is designed to help}} researchers to carry out multitude of experiments, in order to build a <b>practical</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>base</b> in toxin detection. The network is developed in accordance with industry standards, to be used and deployed for prevention in inhospitable environments such as battlefields, toxic urban locations or polluted agricultural regions. The sensor is composed of a processing unit (processor and memory), an archiving unit (permanent data storage), a communication unit, input devices attached to a data acquisition unit, and control devices. The CytoSensor is specifically designed to acquire and analyze visual information about the living cells: hence cameras are used as input devices and frame grabbers are used as the digitizers. The control devices are additional external devices developed to help control and automate the process of data acquisition: they comprise light intensity control USB boards to provide the correct amount of light to view the cells, touch panels for user-instrument interaction, and bar code readers to identify vials and experiments. The software, on the other hand, is a complex mosaic of different elements, each of which has a specific task to accomplish. These building blocks include the real-time acquisition, archiving, networking, processing, modelling, sensor output presentation and user interfaces. Our goal is to develop, integrate and optimize all these components to produce a viable and working device. The prototypes evolved from an offline, portable sensor equipped with a single high-resolution CCD camera and high-quality optics, to distributed online sensors with multiplexed CCD cameras and affordable optics. The acquisition board digitizes in real time the images from one to twelve multiplexed high resolution cameras. Several operational requirements must be met. First, a fault-tolerant and stable control over the input devices and control devices must be provided. Secondly, acquisition timing errors should be minimized as a trade-off between performance and the use of a low-cost, general-purpose, industry-standard operating system such as Microsoft Windows NT. Finally, in order to reduce development time and increase code reusability, a common abstraction layer is designed to provide for flexible use with various types of digitizers and cameras. As part of a distributed detection network, each sensor is able to exchange data with other "trusted" sensors and users, and to allow remote control of certain tasks. The sensor may be seen as a node capable of transmitting and receiving acquired or processed data to a distant device (another sensor, a workstation or a PDA) for visualization, inspection and decision-making by a front-end user. Each node on the network provides a set of complementary services including data acquisition, data processing, communication and system. The mandatory system service monitors the local system performance and manages data archiving. The communication service connects the various services on the network by enabling message-passing, file transfer and caching. The sensor network integrates a lightweight, interoperable and flexible RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to achieve real-time control and monitoring of these distributed resources. A reliable embedded database system is used to store metadata bound to acquired and processed images. This database is also used to maintain information on neighbor nodes, and to check access credentials of available local services. Finally, by adding store-and-forward messaging capabilities, the application can be extended to work in wireless and mobile networks...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a formal}} {{model for the}} resource-based {{configuration}} is introduced. The model gets its motivation from real life applications. The first presented application supports the configuration of computer networks. At present, this system is still a prototype. The second one deals with the configuration of telecommunication systems and is already used in practice. By means of the applications, both representation and processing of domain knowledge within the formal model is illustrated. The peculiarities of the different domains demand a special consideration within the model. We show how the simple model can be extended with the necessary features. On the one side, this features obviously improve the usability of the model, but, on the other side, they lead to a much more complicated processing of domain <b>knowledge.</b> For <b>practical</b> problems, <b>knowledge</b> <b>bases</b> of technical systems reach a size which does not permit a complete search of the solution space. Thus, we present some heuris [...] ...|$|R

Enterpreneurship education nowday is being concern of regulation show the goverment awareness as importance {{of it and}} try to integrate it into the curriculum. But, entrepreneurship education is tend to implement teoritically, similar to business school not as enterpreneuship school with abstract outcome. Learning methods are occur in conventional ways as transfer of knowledge process quite in much, so the attention to mindset and mental transformation is rarely happen. In the other side the learning models are lack of respect to <b>practical</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Project <b>Based</b> Learning (PBL) as an alternative learning model which is provide with sufficient learning outcomes through meaningfull learning process. University is closely relate to the workplace as a potential institution being a pioneer to implement PBL model that could gives both of <b>practical</b> and theoritical <b>knowledge</b> for the student. PBL as a model is relatively ideal to develop essential competences as learning outcomes, and simultaneously university can promote coorperate enterpreneurship to generate condusive environment in implementing PBL model as usefull context...|$|R
