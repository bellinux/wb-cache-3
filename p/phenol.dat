5|$|To secure <b>phenol</b> for aspirin production, and at {{the same}} time {{indirectly}} aid the German war effort, German agents in the United States orchestrated what became known as the Great <b>Phenol</b> Plot. By 1915, the price of <b>phenol</b> rose to the point that Bayer's aspirin plant was forced to drastically cut production. This was especially problematic because Bayer was instituting a new branding strategy in preparation of the expiry of the aspirin patent in the United States. Thomas Edison, who needed <b>phenol</b> to manufacture phonograph records, was also facing supply problems; in response, he created a <b>phenol</b> factory capable of pumping out twelve tons per day. Edison's excess <b>phenol</b> seemed destined for trinitrophenol production.|$|E
5|$|The plot only {{lasted a}} few months. On 24 July 1915, Heinrich Albert's briefcase, {{containing}} {{details about the}} <b>phenol</b> plot, was recovered by a Secret Service agent. Although the activities were not illegal—since the United States was still officially neutral and still trading with Germany—the documents were soon leaked to the New York World, an anti-German newspaper. The World published an exposé on 15 August 1915. The public pressure soon forced Schweitzer and Edison to end the <b>phenol</b> deal—with the embarrassed Edison subsequently sending his excess <b>phenol</b> to the U.S. military—but {{by that time the}} deal had netted the plotters over two million dollars and there was already enough <b>phenol</b> to keep Bayer's Aspirin plant running. Bayer's reputation took a large hit, however, just as the company was preparing to launch an advertising campaign to secure the connection between aspirin and the Bayer brand.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: Exposure {{to smoke}} and uptake of taint imparting <b>phenols</b> in grapes and wines is a {{significant}} problem in bushfire-prone regions of Australia and other countries. The effects of smoke exposure on taint occurrence in wines, however, can be variable. This study assessed the influence of cultivar on uptake and accumulation of smoke-borne <b>phenols</b> in grapes and of subsequent processing and winemaking methods on extraction of <b>phenols</b> into wines. Methods and Results: Smoke-exposure experiments were conducted in commercial vineyards of Chardonnay, Merlot and Sauvignon Blanc 14 days after the onset of veraison. At maturity, grapes were harvested for winemaking, which included malolactic fermentation (MLF) for Merlot. Volatile and glycoconjugated <b>phenols</b> were determined in grapes and the resultant wines. All cultivars had a similar concentration of smoke-derived total <b>phenols</b> in their grapes. The apparent extraction of total <b>phenols</b> from grapes into wines, however, differed markedly among the three traditional winemaking methods. Red winemaking (Merlot) with skin contact extracted 88 % of total grape <b>phenols,</b> whereas white winemaking either by crushing before pressing (Sauvignon Blanc) or by whole-bunch pressing without crushing (Chardonnay), respectively, released 39 and 18 % of total <b>phenols.</b> For Merlot wines, MLF {{did not affect the}} extraction of total smoke-derived <b>phenols.</b> Conclusions: Under standardised exposure conditions (duration, intensity and phenology), the three cultivars studied accumulated a similar concentration of total <b>phenols</b> in grapes. The grape-processing and winemaking methods, however, can bring about a fourfold difference in the concentration of total <b>phenols</b> of wines. The smoke-derived <b>phenols</b> extracted from grapes into wine and the distribution of these <b>phenols</b> between the volatile and conjugated pools were not affected by MLF...|$|R

5|$|Although the United States {{remained}} officially neutral until April 1917, it {{was increasingly}} throwing its {{support to the}} Allies through trade. To counter this, German ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff and Interior Ministry official Heinrich Albert were tasked with undermining American industry and maintaining public support for Germany. One of their agents was a former Bayer employee, Hugo Schweitzer. Schweitzer set up a contract for a front company called the Chemical Exchange Association to buy all of Edison's excess <b>phenol.</b> Much of the <b>phenol</b> {{would go to the}} German-owned Chemische Fabrik von Heyden's American subsidiary; Heyden was the supplier of Bayer's salicylic acid for aspirin manufacture. By July 1915, Edison's plants were selling about three tons of <b>phenol</b> per day to Schweitzer; Heyden's salicylic acid production was soon back on line, and in turn Bayer's aspirin plant was running as well.|$|E

40|$|Phenolic-oil can be {{upgraded}} by etherification with methanol {{to decrease}} the polarity and acidity of the product oil. However, alkoxy <b>phenols</b> have an inhibiting effect to the etherification of alkyl <b>phenols</b> in the phenolic mixture. So, {{it is very important}} to produce alkyl <b>phenols</b> with high selectivity and extremely low content of alkoxy <b>phenols,</b> through a catalytic pyrolytic process. Herein, the effects of HZSM- 5, NaY, and KH 2 PO 4 /AA (KH 2 PO 4 loaded on activated Al 2 O 3) on the pyrolysis of corn straw fermentation residue are investigated, for producing alkyl <b>phenols</b> high efficiently. KH 2 PO 4 /AA is found to be the best catalyst in promoting the formation of alkyl <b>phenols</b> and in inhibiting alkoxy <b>phenols.</b> Under the catalysis of KH 2 PO 4 /AA, the tar yield increases with rising temperature, and reaches to the maximum tar yield of 13. 7 % at 500 degrees C, and then declines with further increasing temperature. The tar obtained under optimized reaction conditions, nearly consists of 50 % of alkyl <b>phenols</b> and over 23 % of aliphatic hydrocarbons with zero content of alkoxy <b>phenols.</b> K 3 Al 2 (PO 4) 3 is generated from the solid phase reaction between KH 2 PO 4 and Al 2 O 3, through which alkoxy <b>phenols</b> can be high selectively adsorbed and activated, and thus leads to the formation of alkyl <b>phenols.</b> (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Animal and {{in vitro}} studies suggest that olive oil <b>phenols</b> are {{effective}} antioxidants. The most abundant <b>phenols</b> in olive oil are the nonpolar oleuropein- and ligstroside-aglycones and the polar hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol. The {{aim of this study}} was to gain more insight into the metabolism of those <b>phenols</b> in humans. We measured their absorption in eight healthy ileostomy subjects. We also measured urinary excretion in the ileostomy subjects and in 12 volunteers with a colon. Subjects consumed three different supplements containing 100 mg of olive oil <b>phenols</b> on separate days in random order. Ileostomy subjects consumed a supplement with mainly nonpolar <b>phenols,</b> one with mainly polar <b>phenols</b> and one with the parent compound oleuropein-glycoside. Subjects with a colon consumed a supplement without <b>phenols</b> (placebo) instead of the supplement with oleuropein-glycoside. Ileostomy effluent and urine were collected for 24 h after supplement intake. Tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol concentrations were low (< 4 mol/ 100 mol of intake) in the ileostomy effluent, and no aglycones were detected. We estimated that the apparent absorption of <b>phenols</b> was at least 55 – 66 % of the ingested dose. Absorption was confirmed by the excretion of tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol in urine. In ileostomy subjects, 12 mol/ 100 mol and in subjects with a colon, 6 mol/ 100 mol of the <b>phenols</b> from the nonpolar supplement were recovered in urine as tyrosol or hydroxytyrosol. In both subject groups, 5 – 6 mol/ 100 mol of the <b>phenols</b> was recovered from the polar supplement. When ileostomy subjects were given oleuropein-glycoside, 16 mol/ 100 mol was recovered in 24 -h urine, mainly in the form of hydroxytyrosol. Thus, humans absorb a large part of ingested olive oil <b>phenols</b> and absorbed olive oil <b>phenols</b> are extensively modified in the body.

5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, Bayer was facing competition in all its major markets from local ASA producers {{as well as other}} German drug firms (particularly Heyden and Hoechst). The British market was immediately closed to the German companies, but British manufacturing could not meet the demand—especially with <b>phenol</b> supplies, necessary for ASA synthesis, largely being used for explosives manufacture. On 5 February 1915, Bayer's UK trademarks were voided, so that any company could use the term aspirin. The Australian market was taken over by Aspro, after the makers of Nicholas-Aspirin lost a short-lived exclusive right to the aspirin name there. In the United States, Bayer was still under German control—though the war disrupted the links between the American Bayer plant and the German Bayer headquarters—but <b>phenol</b> shortage threatened to reduce aspirin production to a trickle, and imports across the Atlantic Ocean were blocked by the Royal Navy.|$|E

40|$|Catalytic {{etherification}} of phenolic {{oil with}} methanol was investigated {{to decrease the}} polarity and acidity of the product oil. The catalyst KH 2 PO 4 /activated alumina (AA) provided the best performance due to its excellent dehydration and anti-coking property.

Alkoxy <b>phenols</b> had an inhibiting effect on etherification of alkyl <b>phenols</b> due to adsorption competition.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} for screening level ecological risk assessment. In this paper, we first established a mass spectrum library including 50 <b>phenols</b> using retention time locking (RTL) technology and deconvolution reporting software (DRS). Distribution of <b>phenols</b> in surface water of the Taihu Lake was screened. Among the 22 identified <b>phenols,</b> 14 <b>phenols</b> were quantified. The concentrations of total <b>phenols</b> ranged 675. 2 - 3346. 1 ng L(- 1). The distributions of ecological effect quotients (EEQs) of 14 <b>phenols</b> were characterized {{in terms of the}} exposure concentration distributions (ECDs) and species sensitivity distributions (SSDs). Those <b>phenols</b> with EEQs exceeding the threshold proposed by Water Environment Research Foundation of Alexandria were selected as priorities. As a result, 2 -nitrophenol (2 -NP), p-chloro-m-xylenol (PCMX) and pyrocatechol were determined as potential ecological risk stressors in surface water of the Taihu Lake. Results of the present study suggested that the proposed approach is feasible for the screening level ecological risk assessment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
25|$|The natural <b>phenols</b> are not evenly {{distributed}} within the fruit. Phenolic acids are largely {{present in the}} pulp, anthocyanins and stilbenoids in the skin, and other <b>phenols</b> (catechins, proanthocyanidins and flavonols) in the skin and the seeds. During the growth cycle of the grapevine, sunlight will increase the concentration of phenolics in the grape berries, their development being {{an important component of}} canopy management. The proportion of the different <b>phenols</b> in any one wine will therefore vary according to the type of vinification. Red wine will be richer in <b>phenols</b> abundant in the skin and seeds, such as anthocyanin, proanthocyanidins and flavonols, whereas the <b>phenols</b> in white wine will essentially originate from the pulp, and these will be the phenolic acids together with lower amounts of catechins and stilbenes.

5|$|Alcohols do not {{normally}} behave as acids in water, but {{the presence of}} a double bond adjacent to the OH group can substantially decrease the pKa by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. Ascorbic acid is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as <b>phenol,</b> which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.|$|E

5|$|Salicylates are {{excreted}} {{mainly by}} the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic <b>phenol</b> (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), gentisic acid (< 1%), and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. When small doses (less than 250 mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 h to 4.5 h. When higher doses of salicylate are ingested (more than 4 g), the half-life becomes much longer (15 h to 30 h), because the biotransformation pathways {{concerned with the}} formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated. Renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated, because it is extremely sensitive to changes in urinary pH. A 10- to 20-fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine pH is increased from 5 to 8. The use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination.|$|E
