50|$|The Goose was {{originally}} {{powered by the}} engine, clutch and transmission {{that came with the}} Buick sedan. These powered the rear swiveling two-axle truck assembly mounted under the rear frame and compartment. The drive shaft powers only the forward axle, which was made from a modified Ford truck rear axle. The rearmost axle is driven by roller chains and sprockets mounted outside of the wheels. The rear truck has twenty-four inch diameter cast wheels.The braking is accomplished by brake shoes between the axles on each truck being pushed against the wheel treads. These are actuated by linkage connecting them to the normal foot pedal and <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> <b>lever.</b> The foot brake is connected to the front truck and the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> is connected to the rear truck. Goose No. 2 never received air brakes.The original paint scheme of Goose No. 2 is still an item of much discussion. Examination of the paint layers on the rear compartment exterior shows a shade of green on the bottom layer. It is now a light green, probably a faded Pullman dark green paint. Over that is black paint, and then the aluminum paint that was used after 1935. The body on Goose No. 2 was replaced around 1939 with the body from the San Christobal Railroad Goose No. 1 which was built by the RGS for the San Christobal in 1934. This is a Fierce-Arrow Model 80 body and is longer with larger side windows than that of the Buick body. The rear freight compartment was shortened eight inches to allow for the longer body and avoid altering the frame and drive shafts. This is its current configuration as displayed.|$|E

50|$|Rio Grande Southern Railroad (RGS), Motor Number 6 (affectionately nicknamed Galloping Goose Number 6) is a {{gasoline}} engine powered narrow gauge railroad motor car. The Goose body and chassis were built from a Buick automobile. The new Buick body {{was cut off}} behind {{the front seat and}} a new rear wall installed. The steering wheel was removed as it was not needed, but the other controls remained. The front axle was removed and replaced with a swiveling two axle lightweight railroad truck with sixteen inch diameter wheels that carried and guided the front of the Goose. Ahead of the front truck is the pilot (cow catcher) attached to the frame. Two small pivoted scrapers attached {{to the rear of the}} pilot slide on the rails to keep small objects on the track from derailing the lightweight front truck. During the winter season a small snow plow (now stored on the car's flatbed) was attached to the front of the pilot.The rear of the car frame was lengthened using steel channel riveted together but welded to the frame to carry the truck type flat-bed platform. The bed has short stake racks around the sides to keep materials from falling off.The Goose was originally powered by the 6-cylinder engine, clutch and transmission that came with the Buick. The drive chain powers the rear swiveling two axle truck assembly mounted under the rear frame and platform bed. The drive shaft turns only the forward axle. The rearmost axle is driven by roller chains and sprockets mounted outside of the wheels on each side.

5000|$|All modern Saabs (except the 9000 and 9-2X) have a {{floor-mounted}} ignition. This is {{for many}} reasons, {{some of which}} follow: Saab believes this is a safer position {{in case of an}} accident. The driver's knee often jerks upward in a collision; the compact and dense ignition module on the steering column of many other cars has shattered many kneecaps. Saabs have bolstered dashboards for both front seat occupants. Also, the floor-mounted position yields more space, allowing modern Saabs to have a metal bar that rotates over and up into the ignition when the key is turned to the [...] "Lock" [...] position. This makes Saabs very challenging to hot-wire. Ergonomically, the ignition's location next to the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> <b>lever,</b> gearshift, and seatbelt, saves time. Last of all, the ignition is located on the floor because, in the aircraft that inspired Saab automobiles, the throttle controls were all located on the floor. Originally Saabs also had the key located {{on the right side of}} the steering column, but when they changed from a column shift to a floor shift, the ignition key followed, except in the Sonett III and 9000.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Different {{models of}} {{tractors}} have been imported from foreign countries or assembled in Iran for many years. Consistency of foreign manufactured products with native specifications and {{the improvement of}} locally manufactured tractors are important problems that must be considered. Moreover, tractor dimensions, sitting space and some other important {{factors such as the}} ability of Iranian users to operate them must be taken into consideration. In this study, we surveyed the proper proportion of tractors dimension, location of control tools and driver’s work space, with Iranian users’ anthropometric data of drivers from five provinces. Human factors are of paramount importance in developing farm machinery given that these machines will often be operated by persons with minimum skills. Therefore, farm machinery should be made simple to operate and as free from hazards as possible. Materials and methods: Firstly, the anthropometric data for 250 users 20 - 60 years old was calculated. The drivers were selected randomly. Then the specifications of 4 tractors including: Ferguson 285, Ferguson 399, Valtra and New Holland were compared with the anthropometric data of user in 5 th and 95 th percentile value and their adaptation was studied. Anthropometric Data of subjects consisted of: standing height, full hand length, popliteal length, seat pan width, seat pan depth, elbow height, seat back support height, hand pan width, hand grip and full-leg length. Getting on the tractor is the first contact of an operator with a tractor. In assessing the suitability of the provision made for getting on the tractor, an experiment was arranged in which operators tried to get on 3 tractors. The mode of getting on the tractors, the agony on the operator’s face, the muscular reactions and individual opinion on the difficulties or comfort while undertaking the task were observed and recorded. The specifications of tractors compared with Anthropometric Data were measured, whiles the tractors were positioned on a level ground for measurements after the tires had been ganged. These specifications were tractor height, steering wheel height, footrest height, foot set height; tractor seat geometry as seat pan width, seat pan depth and seat pan support height; steering geometry as distance of steering wheel from seat reference point, steering wheel radius, steering wheel thickness, steering wheel inclination to the horizontal and seat reach adjustment; levers and pedals distance from seat reference point as gear lever, <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> <b>lever,</b> hydraulic control lever, clutch pedal, accelerator pedal, brake pedal, front panel, workspace width and workspace length. Results and Discussion: The experiment that was conducted with operators attempting to get on the tractors indicated that tractor steps heights were higher than the desirable limit. Therefore, based on the ideas of the researcher and tractors drivers, getting on all tractors is difficult. With {{an increase in the number}} of steps or a decrease in their heights, the desirable condition can be created. Seat depth of new Holland and Valtra tractors were great for drivers in the 5 th percentile value. A variable thickness pad can solve this problem. Results of studies indicated that Seat depth of Massey Ferguson 285 and 399 was shorter than driver’s leg length of 95 th percentile value. To solve the problem an increase of 10 centimeters to pad height of these tractors was suggested. Seat pad of tractors were short for drivers in the 95 th percentile value. Distance of steering wheel from seat reference point (SRP) in Massey Ferguson 285 and Valtra was further than drivers hand length in the 5 th percentile value. Therefore, the drivers hand is short for driver’s good operation. Surveys indicated that drivers had problems for gear lever access in Massey Ferguson 399. Therefore, for good access on gear lever we must increase seat stroke range by 5 - 10 centimeters. The record available from Meteorological Organization indicated that air temperature and rain throughout the year in the study area is between 20 to 40 degrees Celsius and 100 to 300 mm change. Valtra and New Holland tractors having a driver cabs with heating and cooling equipment have the ideal space for the performance of their driver. Massey Ferguson 285 tractor does not have any driver cab and Roll Over Protection Structure (ROPS). Conclusions: This research was conducted in five provinces of Iran to assess ergonomics of some commonly and new used tractors in Iran containing Ferguson 285, Ferguson 399, Valtra and New Holland. As there was no data base with required details, data was collected directly by personal contact with tractor users. A questionnaire was filled out for each person and anthropometric data was calculated in all provinces for 250 users 20 - 60 year old that were selected at random. Then relevant specifications of 4 tractors were measured and compared with the relevant anthropometric data of users in the 5 th and 95 th percentile value and their adaptation was studied. The results indicated that tractor steps, Seat depth, distance of steering wheel and distance of some levers and pedals from seat reference point should be amended...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the stem clamp area, the shifter and/or <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> and grip area on a bar can have several different diameters. For traditional road and mountain handlebars, these diameters are standard and so there has historically been little confusion except when mixing road and mountain components. However, in recent years there have been cross-over bar types that do not fall into one category or the other, and which can conceivably use either type of shifter, <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> or grip (an example is the upright style bar). For this reason, certain handlebars are now available in multiple sizes related to the shifter or <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> clamp diameter.|$|R
