40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} what sexual activities and behaviors college students are <b>participating</b> <b>in,</b> <b>including</b> the use of sexual enhancement products during both partnered and solo sexual activities. Pleasure and sexual satisfaction remain largely absent from today 2 ̆ 7 s sexuality education curricula, resulting in most young adults not being aware of the importance of 2 ̆ 2 sexual pleasure, including autoeroticism, as a source of physical, psychological, intellectual and spiritual well-being 2 ̆ 2 (WAS, 1994). This study looked at college students and their the use of sexual enhancement products during partnered and solo sexual activities, in order to provide a set of baseline measures from which improvements to currently sexuality education can be made. In particular, this study aimed to inform education regarding positive sexual health benefits including pleasure and sexual satisfaction. 2 ̆ 2 Methods 2 ̆ 2. A sample of 956 college students completed a cross-sectional survey on sexual pleasure and enhancement. The survey examined students 2 ̆ 7 current and past sexual behaviors, sexual satisfaction, sexual comfort, use of sexual enhancement products, motivation, and beliefs and attitudes associated with sexual enhancement products. 2 ̆ 2 Results 2 ̆ 2. Findings indicated that age was associated with solo product use (p 3 ̆c. 001) and partnered product use (p 3 ̆c. 001). Participants over the age of 25 are more likely to use products during their solo and partnered sexual activities than 18 - 24 years olds. Results suggest that individuals who use products are more sexually satisfied in regard to masturbation, (p =. 001), solo sexual activities (p =. 004), partnered masturbation (p =. 002), partnered sexual activities (p =. 002), ability to have orgasms during solo sexual activities (p 3 ̆c. 001), and partnered sexual activities (p =. 003), than individuals who do not use products. Results indicate that college students are participating in product use during their solo and partnered sexual activities, and there is a lack of education in college sexuality curricula to educate students on products and pleasure. This study aimed to better educate health professionals on the need for new innovative venues that may be appropriate for the delivery of sexual health education on college campuses...|$|E
