40|$|Performance of Variable Structure controllers, with a PI {{algorithm}} varying as {{a function}} of the error, is analysed in the case of systems subject to uncertainty and saturation nonlinearities. The overall logic is to accomplish large proportional and small integral action for large errors and, viceversa, large integral and small <b>proportional</b> <b>actions,</b> for small errors. The comparison is carried out with respect to constant parameters controllers designed according to the Internal Model Control theory and supplied with an antiwindup device to limit deterioration of performance caused by saturation. Simulation results show that for comparable speed of the time responses in the nominal and unconstrained case, the VS-PI controller is less affected by uncertainty and saturation both for set point tracking and for rejection of disturbances entering at the plant input...|$|R

Although the influence of global temperature on these parameters is known, the effects of its regional variations have not been sufficiently studied. We examined the effects of local hypothermia and hyperthermia on refractoriness and conduction velocity (VC), during constant pacing at cycle lengths of 250 ms. In an experimental model (rabbit isolated heart) we used a new method to perform epicardial cooling and heating on the registered surface. The results show that local variations of temperature generate heterogeneity in the electrophysiological properties of the heart. Hypothermia prolongs refractoriness and decreases VC, in a reversible manner. Hyperthermia (42 ºC) has the opposite effects.

When the actual plant is non minimum phase or with time lag and with input saturation, e. g. a production line with delayed measurements and actuators with input constraints (as for instance in paper or glass productions), the nominal performance of the model-based controllers is not attained. To improve the performance the model-based controller can be designed as in the variable structure standard regulator control: the <b>proportional</b> <b>action</b> is emphasised when the error is large and, on the contrary, neglected {{with respect to the}} integral and/or derivative actions when the error is small enough.

40|$|Many {{control system}} design {{problems}} can be formulated as multi-objective problems: that is there are several competing objectives {{that need to be}} simultaneously satisfied (system step response, rise time, overshoot, disturbance rejection, or integral absolute error). These objectives are imbedded in system’s eigenvalues that are measures of system stability and robustness. The load frequency control (LFC) problem for two interconnected area system is considered, and the objective is to design an appropriate controller based on linear quadratic regulator and/or eigenvalues assignment techniques for achieving zero steady state error due to step input, as well as a desired transient response. The paper addresses two equally important topics: load frequency control and controller design for stable operation. The resulting controller is of proportional state plus integral output type. The two control signals will not interface, since the integral action is usually much slower than the <b>proportional</b> <b>action.</b> An illustrative example is presented and solved by the three algorithms...|$|R

40|$|The {{specific}} {{growth rate}} {{is one of}} the most important process variables characterizing the state of microorganisms during fermentations mainly because the biosynthesis of many products of interest is often related with the values assumed by this parameter. In the particular case of the fed-batch operation of Escherichia coli for the production of recombinant proteins, it is often argued that both pre- and the post-induction specific growth rates should be closely controlled in order to achieve maximum productivities on the desired recombinant protein. In this work a feedforward-feedback controller was developed with the purpose of regulating the global specific growth rate during a fed-batch fermentation of E. coli. The developed algorithm allows to maintain the cells in two different metabolic regimens (simultaneous oxidative and fermentative growth on glucose or oxidative growth on glucose), depending on the selected setpoint for the controlled variable. The pure open-loop version of the controller revealed a relatively poor performance when dealing with process noise. However, the introduction of on-line measurements of fermenter weight and biomass estimation obtained from asymptotic observers allowed a better approximation between the desired setpoints and the simulated values of the specific growth rates. Finally, the introduction of a <b>proportional</b> <b>action</b> in the controller equation allows an improved robustness against variations in model parameters.

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of a load sensing loop in a governor is known to-counteract the effects on engine speed {{of changes in the}} external load. To derive the maximum benefit from load sensing, it is necessary to possess a detailed mathematical representation of the individual elements within the governing loops. In this paper, a method of identifying the dynamic behaviour of a small generating set is described. A governor is designed {{on the basis of this}} dynamic model, and results are presented of tests performed on the generating set controlled by the governor. The governing action is a combination of the feedforward of a load signal, and the feedback of a speed signal. Careful selection of the gain of the feedforward path results in improved governing with only <b>proportional</b> <b>action</b> in the feedback loop. A simple criterion, derived from the mathematical model, predicts a range within which the feedforward gain should lie. The feedback loop is designed by standard control techniques. The experimental results compare favourably with the theoretical predictions. In the tests on the rig, a steady-state droop of &l per cent was held over the full-load range.

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} uncertainties resulting from renewable energy penetration and variability in both supply and demand, {{the control and}} economic optimization for power networks will need to run on faster time-scales. Moreover, distributed and decentralized control architectures are necessary as power systems are distributed large-scale networks {{with a lot of}} complexity, which makes centralized control expensive, inefficient and hard to implement. In this paper, the problem of real-time active and reactive power regulation for power networks with controllable loads and tap-changing transformers is considered. First, the state-space model of a transmission level network under exogenous disturbances is obtained, which is decomposed into two subsystems, describing frequency and voltage dynamics respectively. For the subsystem describing frequency dynamics, an optimization problem relating to active power regulation is first formulated. A distributed controller is then proposed and its optimality, stability and delay robustness are studied. Also, nonlinear <b>proportional</b> <b>actions</b> for controllable loads are introduced to improve the performance of the subsystem. For the subsystem describing voltage dynamics, simple integral control is used for controllable loads and the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop subsystem is shown. To implement the reactive power regulation scheme, a method for local users to detect the tap position variation of the On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC) at the bus they are connected to is presented. Thus, the overall load control scheme is completely decentralized and can be applied easily. Numerical investigations illustrate the performance of the combined active and reactive power regulation scheme...|$|R
