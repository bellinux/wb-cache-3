This work seeks to address some of the design and analysis challenges posed by a variety of these non-linear, time-varying CMOS RF circuits, specifically in the context of low noise design.

Amplitude noise and Q-degradation is quantified for the first time, while the analysis method is also used to re-derive a fundamental limit to the achievable phase noise of any LC oscillator.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{characteristics of}} {{radio frequency interference}} (RFI) signals that can aect the excision potential of some interference mitigation algorithms. The techniques considered are those that modify signals from auxiliary reference antennas to model and cancel interference from an astronomical observation. These techniques can be applied in the time domain, where the RFI voltage is modeled and subtracted from the astronomy signal <b>path</b> (adaptive noise <b>canceling),</b> or they {{can be applied to}} the auto- and cross-correlated voltage spectra in the frequency domain (post-correlation canceling). For ideal receivers and a single, statistically stationary interfering signal, both pre- and post-correlation lters can result in complete cancellation of the interference from the observation. The post-correlation method has the advantage of being applied on 10 s or 100 s of millisecond time scales rather than 10 s or 100 s of nanosecond time scales. However this can be a disadvantage if the RFI transmitter location is changing, since the cross-correlated power measurements which link the interference power in the astronomy and reference signal paths can decorrelate. If the decorrelation is not too severe it can be allowed for, at the expense of a noise increase. The time domain adaptive cancelers are allowed to slightly vary their internal coecients and adapt to changing phases during the integrations, which means that they avoid the decorrelation problem. However, the freedom to adapt also results in a noise increase. In this paper the ability of both types of cancelers to excise interference originating from a moving source is compared. The cancelers perform well on both observed and simulated data, giving complete cancellation. 1...|$|R
40|$|Consumers {{are pushing}} for higher data rates to support more {{services}} that are introduced in mobile applications. As an example, {{a few years ago}} video-on-demand was only accessed through landlines, but today wireless devices are frequently used to stream video. To support this, more flexible network solutions have merged in 4 G, introducing new technical problems to the mobile terminal. New techniques are thus needed, and this dissertation explores five different ideas for receiver front-ends, that are cost-efficient and flexible both in performance and operating frequency. All ideas have been implemented in chips fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology and verified by measurements. Paper I explores a voltage-mode receiver front-end where sub-threshold positive feedback transistors are introduced to increase the linearity in combination with a bootstrapped passive mixer. Paper II builds on the idea of 8 -phase harmonic rejection, but simplifies it to a 6 -phase solution that can reject noise and interferers at the 3 rd order harmonic of the local oscillator frequency. This provides a good trade-off between the traditional quadrature mixer and the 8 - phase harmonic rejection mixer. Furthermore, a very compact inductor-less low noise amplifier is introduced. Paper III investigates the use of global negative feedback in a receiver front-end, and also introduces an auxiliary <b>path</b> that can <b>cancel</b> noise from the main path. In paper IV, another global feedback based receiver front-end is designed, but with positive feedback instead of negative.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{unprecedented}} growth in the popularity and deployment of mobile phones. As this continues, so the strain on existing mobile cellular radio network has also increased, leading {{to the need to}} investigate new technologies to relieve this pressure. The problem is being further exacerbated by the introduction of the 3 rd generation of mobile communications, otherwise known as UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), with the aim of offering multimedia services on pocket sized portable receivers. A major cost of the mobile radio network, in terms of both financial and social/environmental aspects, is the need apparent need for more base transceiver stations (BTS), due to the increased number of services, and the density of them. Therefore, judicious use of fewer, but more "intelligent" base stations, thereby reducing the overall system costs, and extra flexibility in the design of mobile cells would be desirable. This can be achieved by having the BTS antennas remotely positioned from the BTS by transmitting the radio signals down an optical fibre or, as in this project, over free space. The main application for this is in densely urban heavy use areas, where there is extensive reuse of both cell and cell cluster. This, along with building shadowing, would require a BTS on every corner, and where extra cell design flexibility would be desirable. Also, in remote rural areas, where various natural features, such as rivers or mountains can cause similar cell design problems, {{there is a need for}} this flexibility. The problem with this requirement is that the electrical to optical conversion process, involving a laser diode driver unit, is inherently non-linear, and, unless this is resolved, the desired signal will become unusable due to distortion. To overcome these nonlinearities, a novel correction may be used, based on an optical feedforward correction technique. The prototype system employs off-the-shelf components, and has one Fabry Perot laser diode (FP-LD) providing two signals (via a beam splitter), for a main path and one for the error path loop. The error path signal is detected by a receiver circuit, then mixed with a reference signal to produce a 'pure' error signal, which then modulates the second FP-LD. In contrast with previous fibre feedforward systems, where the two LD outputs are then combined in the optical fibre pre-reception, this system has to combine the signals post-reception. After the main signal and error signal are received and recombined, the non-linearities of the main <b>path</b> are predominantly <b>cancelled</b> by those present in the error path signal, leaving only the desired signal, free of non-linearities.

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis divides naturally into two parts. The first concerns {{the development of a}} technique for isolating the supra-surface film of Helium II from the bulk liquid and the Tap our pressure over it, and the study of properties of the film in equilibrium with the gas phase only. The second part of the thesis gives the results of a general investigation of high transport rates in the film. A solution of the problem of isolating the film was seen to depend upon the devising of a practical form of super-fluid filter. Capillary leaks through metal tubes containing closely packed wires, such as those used by Allen and Misener (J.  F.  Allen and A.  D.  Misener, Nature, 141, 75, 1938) in their work on the viscosity of the bulk liquid were found to be suitable. The construction and testing of such wire-tube filters is described. The performance data are tabulated for a typical one, consisting in this case of two tubes in parallel, each containing 900 wires of # 47 Eureka in a 5  cm. long cupronickel tube, initially. 157 " outside diameter,. 072 " inside diameter, drawn down finally to. 104 " outside diameter. Representative values of the amounts of gas, N. T. P., passed by this filter into a vacuum from one atmosphere of helium were:. 01  cc. /min. at 290 °K;. 06  cc. /min. at 90 °K;. 45  cc. /min. at 20 °K; 7  cc. /min. at 4. 3 °K. As the pressure is reduced in the helium temperature region, the amount of gas passed diminishes correspondingly, and at 4  cm.  Hg., 2. 2 °K, it becomes. 07  cc. /min. N. T. P. Below the λ-point, the filters pass no measureable quantity of gas when they are not dipping into liquid. The total transport circumference provided by the above combination of two leaks in parallel is 30  cm., giving a maximum possible film flow corresponding to 110  cc.  gas/min., N. T. P. It is pointed cut that the filters can be easily incorporated into metal apparatus, and an example is given of their application {{to the study of the}} vapour pressure over the film, and also the effect on the transport rate of lowering the vapour pressure over the film. It is found that the vapour pressure in equilibrium with the isolated film is the same as that of the bulk liquid at the same temperature. Above a critical rate of pumping, apparently determined by the incidental film flow up an auxiliary tube, and the evaporation loss of the particular arrangement used, the pressure over the isolated film suddenly decreases, and transport stops. It is shown that at the same time there is a sudden fall of temperature at the transport surface, and apparently a thermomechanical effect in the film which prevents it from moving into the container being pumped. It seems possible that the film is still present but immobilized, and if this is the case, oppositely directed thermomechanical forces along the <b>path</b> do not <b>cancel</b> each other, but act independently. A variety of geometrical arrangements hare been investigated for the occurrence of high transfer rates. It has been found that the transport through a small hole in a surface can be several times larger than that calculated from the perimeter of the hole and the rate established by Daunt and Mendelssohn (J.  G.  Daunt and K.  Mendelssohn, Proc. Roy. Soc. A, 170, 423, 1939) for flow over cylindrical beakers. A number of such holes hare been tested, and it has been found that there is sometimes a strong dependence of the transport rate on the height of the hole above the upper liquid level, and on the shape of the inside surface of the beaker. Experiments have been made similar to those of K.  R.  Atkins (Nature, 161, 925, 1948), who reported high transfer rates in capillaries ending in bulbs, and under the influence of the temperature gradients. The results of Atkins have not been verified, and a probable explanation, based upon the interpretation of his geometrical arrangement, has been given for the apparently high rates observed in the second of his experiments. Some possible explanations for the other discrepancies are considered, and it is recognized that hitherto unexplored experimental factors may be involved. Experiments have been made to eliminate certain possibilities, one in particular being the formation of thick films under certain conditions. This has led incidentally to an observation of a striking example of the high conductivity of helium as a free liquid, apart from the presence of solids on which subsurface could be carried. A summary of the experimental background of the field investigated, and some of the theoretical interpretations, is given in two chapters at the beginning of the thesis. </p...|$|R

[...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 The {{continued}} {{demand for}} {{higher levels of}} wireless access and increased data rates {{for a variety of}} applications from mobile smart phones to back haul point-to-point communication, continues to drive research that enables new spectrum opportunities, reduces form factor and lowers the cost of hardware solutions. The current RF spectrum, which {{is often referred to as}} the frequency band from 1 - 6 GHz, has become increasingly crowded with only a limited amount of unused and unlicensed spectrum. This dissertation explores and implements, single-chip hardware front-end solutions which the specific aim to increase data rates for each single-user using two techniques: a. Using In-band full-duplex radio techniques with self-interference cancellation; b. High-speed communication using large bandwidths available at mmWave frequencies. The advantages, challenges and achievements associated with the two proposed techniques will be described in the following paragraphs. First, in-band full-duplex communication potentially increases spectral efficiency within existing RF standards. This will allow the combination of dedicated transmitting and receiving bands into a single band which would more than double the spectral efficiency. However, this leads to an extremely challenging problem associated with transmitter self-interference cancellation. To date, two full-duplex chips have been designed, fabricated and tested, each with a self-interference cancellation function. The first IC is an analog full-duplex front-end for Bluetooth (BLE) applications. Inside the proposed chip, a self-interference cancellation (SIC) circuitry, a low-power receiver, combined with a harmonic-rejection power amplifier (HRPA) are implemented to reduce the transmitter-to-receiver self-interference, and enable full-duplex operation. These techniques were applied towards the realization of a prototype silicon device which implements a tunable self-interference mitigation canceller function with a current-mode LNA and passive-mixer based front-end, and a power amplifier topology to reduce out-of-band emissions. This chip was fabricated in 40 nm 6 -metal stack CMOS process to achieve more than 30 dB measured self-interference cancellation over 4 MHz bandwidth, and an integrated power amplifier (PA) which suppresses the 3 rd and 5 th harmonics by 30 dB and 15 dB, respectively. The PA delivers a maximum output power of + 14 dBm with a drain efficiency of 33 %. The self-interference cancellation circuitry utilizes an active area of 131 × 112. 5 µm 2, has a power consumption of 0. 25 mW, and degrades the receiver noise figure (NF) by less than 0. 6 dB. The second IC is a transceiver front-end, which includes a dual-injection path self-interference (SI) cancellation circuitry to enable wideband full-duplex communication with a high-power transmitter. The proposed SI cancellation circuitry is implemented using: (1) one feedforward cancellation path containing a 5 -tap analog adaptive filter (AF) between the transmitter (TX) output and the receiver (RX) input; (2) a second cancellation path containing a 14 -tap low-frequency AF with a point of injection at the RX baseband output; (3) a phase noise cancellation method which reduces the phase noise (PN) associated with the down-conversion in the BB cancellation path for the TX SI signal; (4) an integrated noise canceling power amplifier (PA). A prototype 40 nm TSMC device was fabricated which demonstrates more than 50 dB SI cancellation over 42 MHz bandwidth and a 10 dB attenuation of TX SI PN in the RX signal <b>path.</b> The two <b>cancelling</b> filters dissipates 11. 5 mW, with a measured P- 1 dB and IIP 3 of 27 / 26. 5 dBm and 36 / 34. 5 dBm, respectively. The RX noise figure is degraded by less than 1. 55 dB when both cancelers are enabled. The PA has a measured output of P- 1 dB/Psat of 25. 1 / 26. 5 dBm, respectively. The total chip die area is 3. 5 mm 2 with an overall transceiver power consumption of 49 mW excluding the integrated power amplifier. Second, although the lower frequency RF band appears saturated, the vast available spectrum at mmWave frequencies (30 – 300 GHz) presents a potentially attractive solution for high-speed communication. However, communication at mmWave frequencies brings up many new challenging problems for designers when attempting to realize a wideband high accuracy wideband quadrature generator is one of them. One mmWave IC, which includes an integrated two-stage polyphase filter (PPF) with feedback control, is proposed for quadrature local oscillator (LO) generation at millimeter-wave frequencies. To minimize the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) mismatch, the second stage of the PPF utilizes triode-region NMOS transistors to implement variable resistors where the resistance is precisely controlled by modulating the shared gate-to-source bias voltage at the gate of NMOS devices. The gate bias voltage of the triode region devices is set by a feedback loop and changes according with variations in process, voltage, and temperature (PVT). A prototype quadrature signal generator, employing this PPF design, is integrated in 28 nm LP CMOS process. A worst-case measured phase/amplitude imbalance of 2 °/ 0. 32 dB (TT dies) and 2. 2 °/ 0. 55 dB (SS dies) is reported over 7 GHz bandwidth for a fixed control current (ICtrl). By retuning ICtrl every 7 GHz, this IQ generator would maintain the measured quadrature accuracy from 55 -to- 70 GHz. The core area occupied by the IQ generator circuitry is 20 µm × 40 µm and the device consumes less than 192 µW, of which 120 / 72 µW comes from the feedback control-loop / Opamp, respectively. The proposed PPF method has a simulated input impedance of 150 Ω in-parallel with 18 fF...|$|R
