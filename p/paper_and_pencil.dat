25|$|Toon Boom Animation's Toon Boom Harmony {{software}} {{was used as}} the main software package for the production of the film, as the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) system that Disney developed with Pixar in the 1980s for use on their previous traditionally animated films had become outdated. The Harmony {{software was}} augmented with a number of plug-ins to provide CAPS-like effects such as shading on cheeks and smoke effects. The reinstated traditional unit's first production, a 2007 Goofy cartoon short entitled How to Hook Up Your Home Theater, was partly animated without paper by using Harmony and Wacom Cintiq pressure-sensitive tablets. The character animators found some difficulty with this approach, and decided to use traditional <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>pencil</b> drawings, which were then scanned into the computer systems, for The Princess and the Frog.|$|E

25|$|Assistive {{technology}} {{in this area}} is broken down into low, mid, and high tech categories. Low tech encompasses equipment that is often low cost and does not include batteries or requires charging. Examples include adapted <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>pencil</b> grips for writing or masks and color overlays for reading. Mid tech supports used in the school setting include the use of handheld spelling dictionaries and portable word processors used to keyboard writing. High tech supports involve the use of tablet devices and computers with accompanying software. Software supports for writing include the use of auditory feedback while keyboarding, word prediction for spelling, and speech to text. Supports for reading include the use of text to speech (TTS) software and font modification via access to digital text. Limited supports are available for math instruction and mostly consist of grid based software to allow younger students to keyboard equations and auditory feedback of more complex equations using MathML and Daisy.|$|E
25|$|Two dice {{are usually}} used {{to decide what}} part of the wall to start dealing from. They are {{standard}} six sided dice. The dealer marker is a round or square object that the dealer places to the side to remind players who the dealer is. The wind marker may be used which indicates the current prevailing wind. In some cases the dealer marker and the wind marker are represented by one large marker, usually a small wheel where one can swivel the outer circle to indicate the prevailing wind (which the dealer holds onto) or a dice with the four winds placed onto four of the sides which can be placed in a hollow square (the dealer holds onto it. There are a variety of counting pieces used in different countries. They range from Chinese counting sticks (thin sticks with various dots on them to represent various points), poker like chips, paper money, <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>pencil</b> or various apps on tactile screen devices used to calculate and keep scores.|$|E
500|$|Schaper's {{game was}} not the first based upon the insect known as the [...] "cootie". [...] The {{creature}} was the subject of several tabletop games, mostly pencil and paper games, in the {{decades of the twentieth century}} following World War I. The Cootie Game fashioned by the Irvin-Smith Company about 1915 was a hand-held game that involved tilting capsules into a trap over a background illustration depicting a WWI battlefield. [...] In 1927, the J. H. Warder Company of Chicago released Tu-Tee, and the Charles Bowlby Company released Cootie; though based on a [...] "build a bug" [...] concept similar to Schaper's, both were <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>pencil</b> games. [...] In 1937, Rork's released The Game of Cootie, and it too was a <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>pencil</b> game. [...] A <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>pencil</b> party game called Beetle is popular in Britain but its date of origin is unknown. [...] In 1939, Transogram published Cootie, a game featuring a three-dimensional wooden bug assembled in a die-cut tray. [...] Schaper's game was the first to employ a fully three-dimensional, free-standing plastic cootie.|$|E

500|$|AAC {{systems are}} diverse: unaided {{communication}} uses no equipment and includes signing and body language, while aided approaches use external tools. Aided communication methods {{can range from}} <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>pencil</b> to communication books or boards to devices that produce voice output (speech generating devices or SGD's)and/or written output. The symbols used in AAC include gestures, photographs, pictures, line drawings, letters and words, {{which can be used}} alone or in combination. Body parts, pointers, adapted mice, or eye tracking can be used to select target symbols directly, and switch access scanning is often used for indirect selection. Message generation is generally much slower than spoken communication, and as a result rate enhancement techniques may be used {{to reduce the number of}} selections required. These techniques include [...] "prediction", in which the user is offered guesses of the word/phrase being composed, and [...] "encoding", in which longer messages are retrieved using a prestored code.|$|E

2500|$|The {{topic of}} {{numerical}} methods is quite large, obviously being {{of use to}} most fields of engineering and science in general. Numerical methods have been around much longer than computers have (In the 1920s Richardson developed some of the finite difference schemes still in use today, but they were calculated by hand, using <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>pencil,</b> by human [...] "calculators"), but they have become very important through the availability of fast and cheap personal computers.

The report alleged {{it was easy to}} open the voting machine casing. The inner casing around the electronics was only protected by a very simple lock. Thus replacements of software and even hardware were relatively easily possible (by a simple memory chip swap, meaning that the memory that holds the voting data is not encrypted). Another machine is made by SDU and called [...] "NewVote". It is based on a PC and uses a touchscreen instead of buttons. Only ten small districts still use <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>pencil.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Hex is a {{strategy}} board game for two players played on a hexagonal grid, theoretically of any size and several possible shapes, but traditionally as an 11×11 rhombus. Players alternate placing markers or stones (Go stones make ideal playing pieces) on unoccupied spaces {{in an attempt to}} link their opposite sides of the board in an unbroken chain. [...] One player must win; there are no draws. [...] The game has deep strategy, sharp tactics and a profound mathematical underpinning related to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. It was invented in the 1940s independently by two mathematicians, Piet Hein and John Nash. [...] The game was first marketed as a board game in Denmark under the name Con-tac-tix, and Parker Brothers marketed a version of it in 1952 called Hex; they are no longer in production. [...] Hex can also be played with <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>pencil</b> on hexagonally ruled graph paper.|$|E

His presence in many areas of Afghanistan with the tolls prepared for the children amazed several international children rights groups. He went to different areas of the country and asked children to draw something for him with the subject of “War and Peace” giving him <b>papers</b> <b>and</b> <b>pencils</b> <b>and</b> after few days returned to collect the drawings from the children.
