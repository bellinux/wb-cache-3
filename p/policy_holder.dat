500|$|Some tax protesters cite a case called Conner v.

This was the case cited unsuccessfully by LaKerra Sumter before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims {{in the case of}} Sumter v. United States. The Conner case involved the taxability of compensation paid by an insurance company to a <b>policy</b> <b>holder</b> whose house had burned down. The insurance company was reimbursing the homeowner for the costs of renting a place to stay after the home burned down [...] {{under the terms of the}} insurance policy. The insurance company was not paying [...] "wages". The court was not presented with, and did not decide, any issue involving the taxability of wages.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there are}} also many differences, the most {{important}} being that an insurance contract provides an indemnity against the losses actually suffered by the <b>policy</b> <b>holder</b> on an asset in which it holds an insurable interest. [...] By contrast a CDS provides an equal payout to all holders, calculated using an agreed, market-wide method. [...] The holder {{does not need to}} own the underlying security and does not even have to suffer a loss from the default event. The CDS can therefore be used to speculate on debt objects.|$|E

40|$|According to {{insurance}} theory, agents who have insurance coverage have less incentives to make preventive actions. In {{the case of}} complete coverage, this behavior, called ex ante moral hazard, {{is so strong that}} <b>policy</b> <b>holders</b> make no preventive action. Shavell [1979] shows that the optimal insurance contract must contain a deductible in order to give incentives to <b>policy</b> <b>holders.</b> In this article, we argue that this result cannot be obviously extended to the health insurance sector taking into account that <b>policy</b> <b>holders</b> internalize the benefit of their preventive actions through their health state improvement. Using a bi-dimensional utility function, we show that a deductible is not necessarily optimal : it may induce a decrease of the wealth that increases the cost of preventive actions.

5000|$|The term of 'risk {{transfer}}' {{is often}} used in place of risk sharing in the mistaken belief that you can transfer a risk to a third party through insurance or outsourcing. In practice if the insurance company or contractor go bankrupt or end up in court, the original risk is likely to still revert to the first party. As such in the terminology of practitioners and scholars alike, the purchase of an insurance contract {{is often described as}} a [...] "transfer of risk." [...] However, technically speaking, the buyer of the contract generally retains legal responsibility for the losses [...] "transferred", meaning that insurance may be described more accurately as a post-event compensatory mechanism. For example, a personal injuries insurance policy does not transfer the risk of a car accident to the insurance company. The risk still lies with the <b>policy</b> <b>holder</b> namely the person who has been in the accident. The insurance policy simply provides that if an accident (the event) occurs involving the <b>policy</b> <b>holder</b> then some compensation may be payable to the <b>policy</b> <b>holder</b> that is commensurate with the suffering/damage.|$|E
