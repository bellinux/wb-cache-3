Net income reconciliation from IFRS to US-GAAP by fifty randomly selected US-listed EU companies for financial year 2006 is analyzed.

40|$|Estimates of {{stranded}} commitments for US investor-owned {{electric utilities}} range widely, from {{as little as}} $ 20 billion {{to as much as}} $ 500 billion (more than double the shareholder equity in US utilities). These potential losses are a consequence of the above-market book values for some utility-owned power plants, long-term power-purchase contracts, <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> taxes, regulatory assets, and public-policy programs. Because of the wide range of estimates and the potentially large dollar amounts involved, state and federal regulators need a clear understanding of the methods used to calculate these estimates. In addition, they may want simple methods that they can use to check the reasonableness of the estimates that utilities and other parties present in regulatory proceedings. This report explains various top-down and bottom-up methods to calculate stranded commitments. The purpose of this analysis is to help regulators and others understand the implications of different analytical approaches to estimating stranded-commitment amounts. Top-down methods, because they use the utility as the unit of analysis, are simple to apply and to understand. However, their aggregate nature makes it difficult to determine what specific assets and liabilities affect their estimates. Bottom-up methods use the individual asset (e. g., power plant) or liability (e. g., power-purchase contract, fuel-supply contract, <b>and</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> taxes) as the unit of analysis.

Each of this categories has a complex character and it is shaped under an influence of different factors. Their common characteristic is the fact that they are shown in the company’s balance - sheet and they have been established to accomplish definite goals in the future. The provisions are composed primarily of provisions for the <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax, retirement <b>and</b> other benefits and the remaining provisions, which include, for instance, reserves due to the past events caused by restructuring. The main goal of provisions is updating the company’s debt value. These provisions are, thus, connected with a future outlay, which is probable enough on the balance - sheet day to be shown in the balance - sheet. Provisions are classified according to the type of a liability they concern among the remaining and even the main operating costs, financial costs or extraordinary losses. Provisions connected with main operating costs should be established only in exceptional circumstances and, hence, when they concern the really incurred costs. In this case such provision is used to cover a change in <b>deferred</b> cost <b>and</b> accruals. Zadanie pt.

30|$|Corporate {{taxable income}} {{is based on}} the income {{disclosed}} in the financial statements and accounting records, adjusted in accordance with tax principles. The 2007 Spanish General Accounting Plan approved by Royal Decree 1514 / 2007, of November 16 th differentiates between the current income tax expense (<b>income)</b> <b>and</b> the <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax expense (income). The total tax expense or income is the sum of these two items, which should nonetheless be quantified separately. On the one hand, the current income tax expense is the amount payable by the company as a result of income tax settlements for a given year. Conversely, the <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax expense reflects in essence the recognition <b>and</b> settlement of <b>deferred</b> tax assets <b>and</b> liabilities. A <b>deferred</b> tax asset or liability represents the increase or decrease in taxes payable or refundable in future years as a result of temporary differences and any net operating loss or tax credit carry-forwards that exist at the reporting date. Its value is computed with reference to financial reporting standards for book income and tax rules for taxable <b>income.</b> For instance, <b>deferred</b> tax assets can be created by the tax authority recognizing revenues and/or expenses outside of the times set out in the accounting standards. In Spain “tax effect accounting”, which includes the concept of net tax deferred assets, was first introduced in fiscal year 2007.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Portugal, {{the general}} {{adoption}} of the International Accounting Standards was made under the SNC-Accounting Normalization System, in 2010. The SNC carried out new bookkeeping rules concerning the way government grants related to assets. While in the past these grants were treated as liabilities during the economic life of the asset, now the Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards n. ° 22 (NCRF n. ° 22) report them as an item of equity capital. This procedure is {{an exception to the}} rules stated in IAS. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze whatever the accounting for government grants impact on equity capital and, consequently on financial ratios, of Portuguese companies in the agricultural sector. We collect financial information of 2009, from 124 enterprises operating in the agricultural sector, which had report subsidies for investment. The sample was draw from SABI data base. Our model used the amounts reported as “Accrued <b>and</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> - Income taxes - Subsidies for Investments” (old bookkeeping rules), at 31 / 12 / 2009, and estimates the values of the equity capital and financial ratios. We found a positive variation in equity capital, which corresponds to an increase of nearly 4. 5 %. Consequently it caused an increase of 4. 7 % in the indicator of financial autonomy, and also had a positive impact on the solvency ratio, with an average variation greater than 11 %. Our research shows that the new bookkeeping rules have important implication in the values of some financial ratios of Portuguese companies. Even though the new bookkeeping procedures are different from those stated in IAS n° 20, Portugal opted by the same rules as those that Spain and France follow since long time ago and thus Portuguese companies are in equal competition condition to apply European Programs for financial support of investment projects, since it requires some minimum values at certain ratios...|$|R

40|$|Utilizing {{a random}} sample of 80 Canadian public companies, this thesis {{establishes}} that {{a significant increase in the}} number <b>and</b> magnitude of <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax drawdowns occurred in the recessionary period of the early 1980 s. The behaviour of <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax expense is then investigated to determine if the observed increase in drawdowns related to a reduction in fixed asset additions or was the result of accounting losses.;The existing literature on <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> taxes implicitly assumes that drawdowns are the result of involuntary reversals of timing differences that result in a sacrifice of economic resources. However, the data gathered from financial statements leads one to believe that many drawdowns, and in particular the larger ones, are the result of accounting losses.;It was not possible to determine the exact proportion of drawdowns resulting from losses as current Canadian accounting standards do not require that the reason for a drawdown be provided. For this reason, the researcher contacted management of 13 of the companies experiencing drawdowns in the early 1980 s. The result was a substantiation of the belief that losses were a very important factor underlying the increase in drawdowns. It is believed that this has the potential to mislead a financial statement reader as a company 2 ̆ 7 s consolidated financial statements can indicate a profit, yet the drawdown can relate to losses in one or more subsidiaries. This is due to a Canadian requirement that each legal entity file its own separate tax return and therefore each separate legal entity in the consolidated group must individually determine its <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax.;In addition, a review of companies notes relating to loss carryforwards indicated potential departures from the CICA Handbook and a lack of data that the researcher believes is necessary for a usesr to make an assessment of the potential benefit that may be associated with these loss carryforwards.;Partial tax allocation, using the deferral method, is recommended for rapid write-off assets such as Class 29 assets, but the critical recommendations relate to disclosure. Current Canadian accounting standards do not require disclosure of the reasons for changes in <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> taxes, yet the data analyzed shows that it is not possible to make accurate inferences about this behaviour from companies 2 ̆ 7 financial statements.

40|$|Tax-effect {{accounting}} {{has been}} controversy since its origin in allocation {{has generally been}} adopted the subject in the 1940 s. Tax across the English speaking world, even though underlying basic issues have not been resolved. A {{review of the literature}} shows that issues such as: whether income tax is an expense; whether the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax is a liability and whether the provision for future income tax benefit is an asset have not been resolved because of differing opinions as to what is an expense, liability or an asset. The development of a conceptual framework in Australia, which provides definitions of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, has provided an opportunity to reexamine some of the unresolved issues mentioned above. Since the conceptual framework, in SAC 4, defines an expense in terms of whether it increases a liability or reduces an asset the re-examination was directed at ascertaining whether the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax satisfies the definition and recognition criteria for a liability. The results were inconclusive. However, it was possible to conclude that the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax does not readily satisfy the criteria in SAC 4. An empirical investigation was then undertaken to ascertain whether selected user groups treat the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax as a liability. The investigation surveyed investment houses, company secretaries, auditors and the parties to trust deeds. Evidence gathered suggest that investment houses and company secretaries treat the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax all a liability. Auditors appear to regard the provision for income tax as a deferred credit; not a liability. No evidence was found that the parties to trust deeds treat the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax In a systematic way. It is concluded that the parties to trust deeds do not consider the nature of the provision for <b>deferred</b> <b>income</b> tax when negotiating borrowing limitation ratio.

40|$|Borehole radar is a short-range, {{high-resolution}} geophysical {{technique that}} can be used to delineate the position of the Merensky platinum reef in underground mines situated in the Western Bushveld Complex. In this study, borehole radar is used in reflection mode from four boreholes drilled sub-parallel to the expected position of the Merensky Reef within an underground mining block bounded by two cross-cuts and a haulage. This study relates the stratigraphic column at Amandelbult Section to borehole radar reflectivity. The radar illumination line coordinates produced along the Merensky Reef surface are used to construct a three-dimensional surface of the reef within the defined mining block. The geophysical interpretation presented here shows how a slump in the Merensky Reef, called a pothole, is imaged using borehole radar. This study analyses the increase in geological confidence related to the improved delineation of the elevation of the Merensky Reef. The financial impact of using borehole radar to delineate this pothole is analysed at the various mining steps, namely: orebody definition, mine planning, mine development, ore extraction and ore processing. The information gained by conducting borehole radar is compared with the information acquired using only standard geological drilling. This study concludes that the application of borehole radar significantly increases the confidence in the geological model prior to mining. Conducting borehole radar prior to mining improves mine planning and development, ensures that less waste is mined, facilitates the effective deployment of labour crews, prevents waste being sent to the processing plant <b>and</b> avoids <b>deferring</b> <b>income</b> until a later date. Recommendations are made on how to plan for and include borehole radar in the mining process. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009. Geologyunrestricte...|$|R

40|$|Long overdue {{changes to}} {{negative}} gearing and {{capital gains tax}} would save the Commonwealth Government about $ 5. 3 billion a year. Summary The interaction of a fifty per cent capital gains tax discount with negative gearing distorts investment decisions, makes housing markets more volatile and reduces home ownership. The two measures in combination allow investors to reduce <b>and</b> <b>defer</b> personal <b>income</b> tax, at an annual cost of $ 11. 7 billion to the public purse. Other taxes, which often drag more on the economy than {{a capital gains tax}} does, must be higher as a result. And like most tax concessions, these tax breaks largely benefit the wealthy. The capital gains tax discount should be reduced from 50 to 25 per cent, and negatively geared investors should no longer be allowed to deduct losses on their investments from labour income. A smaller discount would save about $ 3. 7 billion a year, while the change to negative gearing would raise $ 2 billion a year in the short term, falling to $ 1. 6 billion as losses start to be written off against positive investment income. The reforms would provide relief to the Budget in tough times and slightly improve housing affordability with little impact on how much people save. Property prices would be up to two per cent lower under these reforms than they would be otherwise. Contrary to urban myth, rents won’t change much, nor will housing markets collapse. The effects on property prices would be small compared to factors such as interest rates and the supply of land. The reforms should be phased in, to make them easier to sell and to prevent a rush of investors selling property before the changes come into force. While other proposals, such as restricting negative gearing to new properties or limiting the dollar value of deductions, would improve the current regime, they nevertheless leave too many problems in place and introduce unnecessary distortions. These two sensible reforms won’t hurt private savings much but will save the government a lot of money...|$|R
