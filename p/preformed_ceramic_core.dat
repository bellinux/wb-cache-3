It was found that freckles occur not only on the casting external surfaces, but also appear near the internal interfaces between the <b>ceramic</b> <b>core</b> and superalloys. Meanwhile, the size, initial position, and area of freckle were investigated in various diameters of the specimens. The initial position of the freckle chain reduces when the diameter of the rods increase. Freckle area follows a linear relationship in various diameters and the average freckle fraction is 1. 1 % of cross sectional area of casting specimens. The flow of liquid metal near the interfaces was stronger than that in the interdendritic region in the mushy zone, and explained why freckle tends to occur on the outer or inner surfaces of castings.

40|$|Process {{modeling}} of metal melt flow in porous media {{plays an important}} role in casting of metal matrix composites. In this work, a mathematical model of the metal melt flow in <b>preform</b> <b>ceramic</b> particles was used to simulate the flow behavior in a mold cavity. The effects of fluid viscosity and permeability (mainly affected by porosity of <b>ceramic</b> <b>preforms)</b> on the flow behavior were analyzed.

The pressure drop has a linear relationship with the fluid velocity, and a nonlinear relationship with porosity. When the porosity is relatively small, the pressure drop is extremely large. When porosity exceeds a certain value, the pressure drop is independent of porosity.

40|$|Superalloy {{airfoils}} {{are produced}} by investment casting (IC), which uses <b>ceramic</b> <b>cores</b> and wax patterns with ceramic shell molds. Hollow cored superalloy airfoils in a gas turbine engine are an example of complex IC parts. The complex internal hollow cavities of the airfoil are designed to conduct cooling air through one or more passageways. These complex internal passageways have been fabricated by a lost wax process requiring several processing steps; core preparation, injection molding for wax pattern, and dipping process for ceramic shell molds. Several steps generate problems such as high cost and decreased accuracy of the ceramic mold. For example, costly tooling and production delay are required to produce mold dies for complex cores and wax patterns used in injection molding, resulting in a big obstacle for prototypes and smaller production runs. Rather than using separate cores, patterns, and shell molds, it would be advantageous to directly produce a mold that has the casting cavity and the <b>ceramic</b> <b>core</b> by one process. Ceramic stereolithography (CerSLA) {{can be used to}} directly fabricate the integrally <b>cored</b> <b>ceramic</b> casting mold (ICCM).
