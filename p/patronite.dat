X-ray powder data (31 lines) indexed on an orthorhombic cell give a 12. 12, b 9. 71, and c 14. 92,~, cell volume 1755. 8 A 3 and Z = 8. Refractive indices are a 1. 505, fl 1. 519, and ~ 1. 533, D is 1. 95 (measured) and 2. 01 (calculated), H = 1 - 189 (Mohs). Thermal analysis and X-ray powder data show stanleyite to be quite different from minasragrite (the pentahydrate) which it clearly mimics. Associated minerals are potassium alum, pyrite, and quartz.

40|$|With the {{exploding}} interest in transition metal chalcogenides, sulfide minerals containing the dianion S 2 2 -, such as pyrite (FeS 2), cattierite (CoS 2), and vaesite (NiS 2), have recently {{attracted much attention}} for potential applications in energy conversion and storage devices. However, the synthesis of the <b>patronite</b> structure (VS 4, V 4 +(S 2 2 -) 2) and its applications {{have not yet been}} clearly demonstrated because of experimental difficulties and the existence of nonstoichiometric phases. Herein, we report the synthesis of VS 4 using a simple, facile hydrothermal method with a graphene oxide (GO) template and the characterization of the resulting material. Tests of various templates such as CNT, pyrene, perylene- 3, 4, 9, 10 -tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), and graphite led us {{to the conclusion that the}} graphitic layer plays a role in the nucleation during growth of VS 4.

40|$|Here {{we report}} the {{hydrothermal}} synthesis and detailed study on supercapacitor applications of a <b>patronite</b> hybrid, VS 4 /reduced graphene oxide, which showed an enhanced specific capacitance of similar to 877 F g(- 1) at a current density of 0. 5 A g(- 1). In comparison to bare vanadium sulfide and reduced graphene oxide, the hybrid showed similar to 6 times and similar to 5 times higher value of specific capacitance, respectively. The obtained energy density (117 W h kg(- 1)) and power density (20. 65 kW kg(- 1)) {{are comparable to}} those of other reported transition metal sulfides and their graphene hybrids. Theoretical calculations using density functional theory confirm an enhanced quantum capacitance of VS 4 /graphene composite systems, owing primarily to the shifting of the graphene Dirac cone relative to the band gap of VS 4.

40|$|Vanadium sulfide VS 4 in the <b>patronite</b> mineral {{structure}} is a linear chain compound comprising vanadium atoms coordinated by disulfide anions [S- 2](2 -). V- 51 NMR {{shows that the}} material, despite having V formally in the d(1) configuration, is diamagnetic, suggesting potential dimerization through metal metal bonding associated with a Peierls distortion of the linear chains. This is supported by density functional calculations, and {{is also consistent with}} the observed alternation in V V distances of 2. 8 and 3. 2 angstrom along the chains. Partial lithiation results in reduction of the disulfide ions to sulfide S 2 -, via an internal redox process whereby an electron from V 4 + is transferred to [S- 2](2 -) in oxidation of V 4 + to V 5 + and reduction of the [S- 2](2 -) to S 2 - to form Li 3 VS 4 containing tetrahedral [VS 4](3 -) anions. On further lithiation this is followed by reduction of the V 5 + in Li 3 VS 4 to form Li 3 +xVS 4 (x = 0. 5 - 1), a mixed valent V 4 +/V 5 + compound. Eventually reduction to Li 2 S plus elemental V occurs. Despite the complex redox processes involving both the cation and the anion occurring in this material, the system is found to be partially reversible between 0 and 3 V. The unusual redox processes in this system are elucidated using a suite of short-range characterization tools including V- 51 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), S K-edge X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES), and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of X-ray dataclose...|$|E
