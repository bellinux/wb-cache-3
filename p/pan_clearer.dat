60|$|He was {{too deeply}} engaged to notice {{more than that}} {{somebody}} had entered the cabin. They stood at his shoulder and looked on. He imparted to the pan a deft circular motion, pausing once or twice to rake out the larger particles of gravel with his fingers. The water was muddy, and, with the pan buried in it, they could see nothing of its contents. Suddenly he lifted the <b>pan</b> <b>clear</b> and sent {{the water out of}} it with a flirt. A mass of yellow, like butter in a churn, showed across the bottom.|$|R
5000|$|During rebuilding, {{they were}} fitted with LMS {{standard}} boilers {{that had to}} be placed higher than the originals to allow the firebox and ash <b>pan</b> to <b>clear</b> the rear driving wheel axle. The smokebox saddle was extended accordingly to offer support. The closely coupled driving wheels accentuated the appearance of the high-pitched boiler, earning these engines the nickname of [...] "Whippet" [...] because of a perceived resemblance to the breed of racing dog. [...] All members of the class were officially named after Ulster counties.|$|R
40|$|For several years, European {{financial}} markets {{have been the}} place of important mutations. These mutations have hit both stock markets themselves {{as well as the}} infrastructures including all necessary services for the transactions on financial securities. Among the market services to which the investors appeal, is the clearing of the orders, the service which allows reducing exchanged flows while guaranteeing their safety. The market of clearing became strongly competitive with the arrival of new <b>Pan</b> European <b>clearing</b> houses. Confronted with aggressive pricing policies, "incumbent" clearing houses have to adopt new strategies : merger, simple or mutual links of interoperability. We develop a model of industrial organization to appreciate the consequences of these various strategies in terms of price and social welfare. The strategic incentives of clearing houses and their effects on their customers, i. e. investors, are observed by means of a sequential game. We show that the interoperability agreements are never reached at the equilibrium {{in spite of the fact}} that the "European code of good practice" of postmarkets incites them to accept this type of agreements. On the other hand, a merger between incumbent clearing houses can occur under some conditions. The merger is beneficial to these last ones as well as to the investors, but it is unfavourable to the <b>Pan</b> European <b>clearing</b> houses...|$|R
5000|$|As {{part of this}} [...] "Renewal Programme" [...] {{members of}} Class A were rebuilt as {{two-cylinder}} simples (i.e. not compounds). Those reclassified as Class A1 were rebuilt with a Midland Railway type RG6 boiler and new cylinders both of 18 in diameter by 24 in stroke. The boiler was higher pitched than the original to allow the firebox and ash <b>pan</b> to <b>clear</b> the rear driving wheel axle and an extension of 24.75 in to the smokebox saddle was needed to offer support. Although the effect was less striking {{than that of the}} similarly rebuilt Class B3, the modified appearance was such that these locomotives would be included among those that gained the nickname of [...] "Whippet" [...] because of a perceived resemblance to the racing dog. [...] All the class were officially named after mountains although that allocated to No. 58, Lurigethan, was never carried.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, Kanton (then spelled [...] "Canton") Island was {{considered}} part of the British-controlled Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony. The atoll is a low, narrow rim of land surrounding a large shallow lagoon. It is 4½ miles wide on the west, from which it narrows to the southeast point, which is nine miles distant from the northwest point. The airfield was built on the island's northwestern corner by Pan American Airways between 1938-39, and was used by that airline as a stopover on its route from Hawaii to New Zealand. <b>Pan</b> American also <b>cleared</b> and deepened a portion of the lagoon during this time.|$|R
50|$|The {{first episode}} gives an {{overview}} of the variety of the Caribbean’s natural history, revealing the hidden wild side of the islands. Spotted and bottlenose dolphins cruise the shallow sand banks around the Bahamas. The mangrove forests of Barbuda’s shallow lagoons provide ideal nest sites for the Caribbean’s largest colony of frigatebirds. The birds are filmed jostling over the best locations and collecting floating sticks on the wing. The nearby islands of St Lucia, St Vincent and Dominica have a different character. The thickly forested slopes of their volcanic mountains harbour rare hummingbirds and parrots. Their fertile soils also attract people, but scenes of the Montserrat eruptions of recent years show the threat they live with. The deep waters off Dominica are breeding grounds for sperm whales, filmed engaging in tactile social behaviour at the surface. Caves are a feature of Cuba’s limestone geology, and provide homes for millions of bats as well as Cuban boas and secretive hutias, the latter filmed {{for the first time in}} the wild. The southerly ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao), swept by dry trade winds, are virtual deserts. Every year, 20,000 Caribbean flamingos arrive to breed on their salt <b>pans.</b> The <b>clear</b> waters around Bonaire have the greatest variety of reef fish anywhere in the Caribbean. The final island to be featured is Trinidad, cut off from South America by rising sea levels 2,000 years ago. Its island fauna include many mainland species such as red howler monkeys, capuchins and scarlet ibis.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we have {{provided}} a complete overview of the different methods proposed in the literature to tackle the pansharpening problem and classified them into different categories according to the main technique they use. As previously described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, the classical CS and RSC methods provide pansharpened images of adequate quality for some applications but usually they introduce high spectral distortion. Their results highly depend on the correlation between each spectral band and the <b>PAN</b> image. A <b>clear</b> trend in the CS family, as we explained in Section 3.1, is to use transformations of the MS image, so that the transformed image mimics the PAN image. In this sense, a linear combination of the MS image is usually used by weighting each MS band with weights obtained either from the spectral response of the sensor or by minimizing, in the MMSE sense, {{the difference between the}} PAN and this linear combination. By using this technique, the spectral distortion can be significantly reduced. Another already mentioned important research area is the local analysis of the images, producing methods that inject structures in the pansharpened image depending on the local properties of the image.|$|R
5000|$|Trail of the Octopus: From Beirut to Lockerbie - Inside the DIA {{is a book}} co-written by Lester Coleman and Donald Goddard. It {{received}} its United Kingdom publication in 1993 and its first United States publication in 2009. Coleman wrote that terrorists had infiltrated a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) operation outside of the United States and, because of incompetence on part of the DEA, were able to smuggle a bomb on Pan Am 103. Coleman said [...] "No one knows {{what is really going}} on. If they ever did, it would make Watergate look like Alice in Wonderland." [...] In the book Coleman accused Hurley of being the primary figure of responsibility of a coverup of the actual causes of the crash; Coleman also accused Martz and another Atlanta Journal-Constitution journalist, Lloyd M. Burchette, Jr., of being involved in a coverup. In the book Coleman also claims he sought, and was granted, political sanctuary in Sweden and further claims in the book that after he was under Swedish protection he provided Pan American World Airways with a civil affidavit which <b>cleared</b> <b>Pan</b> Am of full responsibility for the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.|$|R
50|$|The Tenerife airport {{disaster}} on 27 March 1977 was {{the collision}} of two Boeing 747 passenger aircraft on the runway of Los Rodeos Airport (now known as Tenerife North Airport) in Tenerife, Spain; killing 583 people, the crash is the deadliest accident in aviation history. All 248 aboard KLM flight 4805 were killed, as were 335 people on Pan Am flight 1736. In heavy fog on the airport's only runway, Veldhuyzen van Zanten took off without clearance and crashed {{into the top of}} the Pan Am aircraft, which was backtaxiing in the opposite direction under the direction of Air Traffic Control; the KLM's flight crew had been aware of Pan Am backtaxiing behind them on the same runway. The dense fog prevented visual confirmation; the KLM captain thought that <b>Pan</b> Am had <b>cleared</b> the runway, and started to take off without further clearance to do so. Veldhuyzen van Zanten's actions were the result of a number of other factors, including communication difficulties with Air Traffic Control (accents, and non-standard phraseology); he wrongly believed he had been given take off clearance when he received a departure clearance, and the Control Tower assumed that the KLM 747 remained stationary on the runway as instructed.|$|R
40|$|An {{antibody}} library against Eimeria tenella sporozoites {{was constructed}} by phage display. Total RNA was {{isolated from the}} spleen, bone marrow, and ceca of immune chickens, and was used to reverse-transcribe cDNA. Heavy and light antibody variable genes were amplified from cDNA by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), using primer pairs that contain complementary sequences encoding a short linker sequence. The single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) was obtained by a secondary overlap PCR with primers that incorporate SfiI restriction sites, thus allowing for subsequent cloning into the phagemid vector pComb 3 X. Vector and scFv insert were digested with SfiI, ligated, and transformed into competent XL 1 -Blue Escherichia coli cells by electroporation, yielding a library with 7. 4 x 107 total transformants. The culture was grown under carbenicillin selective pressure, rescued with helper phage, and the antibody-displaying phage was precipitated by PEG/NaCl, and subsequently used for panning. Five panning rounds were performed using cryopreserved E. tenella sporozoites, with a gradual increase of washing stringency to select for specific, highaffinity binders. A 1000 -fold increase in phage output was obtained after 3 rounds of <b>panning.</b> There was <b>clear</b> enrichment of the positive clones over the panning rounds, with the 3 rd round resulting in a 3, 000 -fold enrichment over the first one, as the binding clones became the dominant population in the library. Selected antibodies from the last round of panning were sequenced and characterized by immunoblotting. Soluble antibody fragments were produced in a non-suppressor E. coli strain, and recognized a 66 -KDa sporozoite antigen on a Western blot. Primary cultures of chicken enterocytes were prepared {{in the hope of}} serving for invasion assays with E. tenella sporozoites. The isolation procedure, however, proved to be cumbersome and time-consuming. Future investigations will focus on purification and further characterization of antibodies selected from the constructed library. Such antibodies can be tested, alone or in combination, for their ability to block in vitro the invasion mechanism of E. tenella...|$|R
