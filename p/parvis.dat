25|$|Historically, two large, arched doors allowed {{access to}} the church. However, only the {{left-hand}} entrance is currently accessible, as the right door has long since been bricked up. These entrances {{are located in the}} <b>parvis</b> of a larger courtyard, or plaza.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the exhibition halls, the various stages and theatres of the city, including that of La Gespe devoted to contemporary music. La Pari, the performing arts stage, is still a place for contemporary creativity. The main theatre remains that of the Nouveautés but Le <b>Parvis,</b> a multidisciplinary cultural institution combining music, dance and cinema on the outskirts {{in the heart of}} the Le Meridien commercial centre, sees many pieces played within.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the few}} {{elements}} to survive from the mid-12th-century church, the Portail royal was integrated into the new cathedral built after the 1194 fire. Opening on to the <b>parvis</b> (the large square {{in front of the}} cathedral where markets were held), the two lateral doors would have been the first entry point for most visitors to Chartres, as it remains today. The central door is only opened for the entry of processions on major festivals, of which the most important is the Adventus or installation of a new bishop. The harmonious appearance of the façade results in part from the relative proportions of the central and lateral portals, whose widths are in the ratio 10:7 – one of the common medieval approximations of the square root of 2.|$|E
25|$|On some of {{the busiest}} routes, the {{convenience}} of the low floor is lost because of the anomalies caused by the hesitant upgrade of tram to metro. The city has four heavy metro lines and three stretches of premetro or underground tram. The premetro tunnels have been built to allow for eventual upgrade to heavy metro, {{so most of the}} platform is high, and is connected to the street (at least in the upward direction) by escalator. At some stations lifts have been installed, but there is a cutout section taking the level down to one foot above ground to board the trams. The three steps this entails make life difficult for passengers with baby buggies or suitcases, even though the new low-floor trams are accessible to wheel-chair users. To get around this last barrier to mobility, an experimental ramp was installed in 2009 at <b>Parvis</b> de St-Gilles/St-Gillis Voorplein.|$|E
25|$|For {{most of the}} 18th century, the {{hospitals}} were religious institutions, run by the church, which provided more spiritual than actual medical care. The largest and oldest was the Hôtel-Dieu, located on the <b>parvis</b> of Notre-Dame Cathedral {{on the opposite side}} of the square from its present location. It was founded in 651 by Saint Landry of Paris. Its original buildings were entirely destroyed in the course of three fires in the 18th century, in 1718, 1737 and 1772. It was staffed by members of religious orders, and welcomed the destitute as well as the sick. Despite having two, three or even four patients per bed, it was always overflowing with the sick and poor of the city. The city had many smaller hospitals run by religious orders, some dating to Middle Ages; and there were also many specialized hospitals; for former soldiers at Les Invalides; for the contagious at La Sanitat de Saint-Marcel, or La Santé; a hospital for abandoned children, called Les Enfants Trouvés; a hospital for persons with sexually transmitted diseases, in a former convent on boulevard Port Royal, founded in 1784; and a hospital for orphans founded by the wealthy industrialist Beaujon, opened in 1785 on the Faubourg Saint-Honoré. Some hospitals served as prisons, where beggars were confined; these included the hospital of La Pitié, and La Salpêtrie, an enormous prison-hospital reserved for women, particularly prostitutes. In 1793, during the course of the Revolution, the royal convent of Val-de-Grâce was closed and was turned into a military hospital, and in 1795, the abbey of Saint-Antoine, in the Saint-Antoine quarter, was also converted into a hospital.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{located along}} the <b>parvis</b> {{are a few}} smaller {{structures}} and openings: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Exposition Universelle of 1878. [...] For this exposition, {{the first}} held during the new Third Republic, a château d'eau with a grotto, upper basin and fountains, {{a series of}} cascades, and a lower basin with fountains were built {{on the slopes of}} Chaillot, {{at the foot of the}} Palais du Trocadero, at the present site of the fountains of the Trocadero[...] [...] The basins were {{surrounded}} by six gilded cast iron sculptures of animals representing the six continents. (These statues are now located on the <b>parvis</b> of the Musée d'Orsay.).|$|E
2500|$|Ereignis is {{translated}} {{often as}} [...] "an event," [...] but is better {{understood in terms}} of something [...] "coming into view." [...] It comes from the German prefix, er-, comparable to 're-' in English, and Auge, eye. It is a noun coming from a reflexive verb. Note that the German prefix er- also can connote an end or a fatality. A recent translation of the word by Kenneth Maly and <b>Parvis</b> Emad renders the word as [...] "enowning"; that in connection with things that arise and appear, that they are arising 'into their own'. Hubert Dreyfus defined the term as [...] "things coming into themselves by belonging together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bourget died on June 8, 1885 at Sault-au-Récollet. [...] A {{funeral service}} was {{conducted}} by Father Collin, the Superior of the Sulpicians, at the Church of Notre Dame, and Bourget's body was buried alongside that of his predecessor Jean-Jacques Lartigue in a vault under the southwest pillar of {{the dome of the}} then-unfinished St James Cathedral, later renamed as Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral. [...] On March 20, 1993, his remains were transferred to the Cathedral's mortuary chapel for bishops and archbishops, of which his mausoleum forms the centre. On June 24, 1903 a statue of Bourget created by artist Louis-Philippe Hébert was unveiled in the <b>parvis</b> of the St James Cathedral. [...] The statue was funded by approximately $25,000 in donations from Catholic clergy and faithful. [...] In 2005 a cleaning and restoration of the statue was performed.|$|E
2500|$|St. Paul's Cathedral {{is built}} in the Baroque style, with some {{influences}} from native Maltese architecture. The main façade is in St. Paul's Square (...) , and it is set on a low <b>parvis</b> approached by three steps. The façade is cleanly divided into three bays by pilasters of Corinthian and Composite orders. The central bay is set forward, and it contains the main doorway, which is surmounted by the coats of arms {{of the city of}} Mdina, Grand Master Ramon Perellos y Roccaful and Bishop Davide Cocco Palmieri, all of which were sculpted by Giuseppe Darmanin. The coloured coat of arms of the incumbent archbishop (presently Charles Scicluna) is located just below the arms of Mdina. A round-headed window is set in the upper story above the doorway, and the façade is topped by a triangular pediment. Bell towers originally containing six bells are located at both corners of the façade. It has an octagonal dome, with eight stone scrolls above a high drum leading up to a lantern.|$|E
2500|$|The Romans {{built an}} entirely new city {{as a base for}} their {{soldiers}} and the Gallic auxiliaries intended {{to keep an eye on}} the rebellious province. The new city was called Lutetia (Lutèce) or [...] "Lutetia Parisiorum" [...] ("Lutèce of the Parisii"). The name probably came from the Latin word luta, meaning mud or swamp Caesar had described the great marsh, or marais, along the right bank of the Seine. [...] The major part of the city was on the left bank of the Seine, which was higher and less prone to flood. It was laid out following the traditional Roman town design along a north-south axis (known in Latin as the cardo maximus). On the left bank, the main Roman street followed the route of the modern day Rue Saint-Jacques. It crossed the Seine and traversed the Île de la Cité on two wooden bridges: the [...] "Petit Pont" [...] and the [...] "Grand Pont" [...] (today's Pont Notre-Dame). The port of the city, where the boats docked, was located on the island where the <b>parvis</b> of Notre Dame is today. On the right bank, it followed the modern Rue Saint-Martin. [...] On the left bank, the cardo was crossed by a less-important east-west decumanus, today's Rue Cujas, Rue Soufflot and Rue des Écoles.|$|E
2500|$|The work of {{creating}} parks, squares and promenades during the Belle Époque {{continued in the}} Second Empire style. The projects were managed at first by Jean-Charles Alphand, {{who had been the}} head of department of parks and promenades under Haussmann and was elevated to the post of Director of Public Works of Paris, a position he held until his death in 1891. He was also the director of works of the 1889 Universal Exposition, responsible for building the exposition's gardens and pavilions. Alphand finished several of the projects begun under Haussmann: [...] the Parc Montsouris (1869–78), the Square Boucicaut (1873), and the Square Popincourt (later renamed Parmentier, and still later Maurice-Gardette), which replaced a demolished slaughterhouse and opened in 1872. Alphand's first major project of the Belle Époque was the Jardins du Trocadéro, the site of the Universal Exposition of 1878 that surrounded the enormous Palais de Trocadéro, which served as the main building for the exposition. He filled the park with a grotto, fountains, gardens and statues (the statues can now be seen on the <b>parvis</b> of the Musée d'Orsay). The park also displayed the full-sized head of the Statue of Liberty before the statue was completed and shipped to New York City. The grotto and much of the park are still preserved as they were. It was used again for the Universal Exposition of 1889 Exposition, and with new fountains and a new palace added, it was also used for the Universal Exposition of 1937.|$|E

60|$|King Charles look'd {{with new}} Pleasure upon this lucky Effort {{of his old}} Deliverers. Captivity is a State no way {{desirable}} to Persons however brave, of the most private Station in Life; but for a King, within two Days of falling into the Hands of his Rival, to receive so seasonable and unexpected a Deliverance, must be supposed, as it really did, to open a Scene to universal Rejoicing among us, too high for any Words to express, or any Thoughts to imagine, to those that were not present and Partakers of it. He forthwith gave Orders for a Medal to be struck suitable to the Occasion; one of which, set round with Diamonds, he presented to Sir John Leake, the English Admiral. The next Orders were for re-casting all the damag'd brass Cannon which the Enemy had left; upon every one of which was, by order, a Sun eclyps'd, with this Motto under it: Magna <b>parvis</b> obscurantur.|$|E
6000|$|To this it must {{be added}} that the {{congregation}} of Salem compelled Mr. <b>Parvis,</b> in whose family the disturbance had begun, and who, they alleged, was the person by whom it was most fiercely driven on in the commencement, to leave his settlement amongst them. Such of the accused as had confessed the acts of witchcraft imputed to them generally denied and retracted their confessions, asserting them {{to have been made}} under fear of torture, influence of persuasion, or other circumstances exclusive of their free will. Several of the judges and jurors concerned in the sentence of those who were executed published their penitence for their rashness in convicting these unfortunate persons; and one of the judges, a man of the most importance in the colony, observed, during the rest of his life, the anniversary of the first execution as a day of solemn fast and humiliation for his own share in the transaction. Even the barbarous Indians were struck with wonder at the infatuation of the English colonists on this occasion, and drew disadvantageous comparisons between them and the French, among whom, as they remarked, [...] "the Great Spirit sends no witches." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{is indeed}} in Piso, a very odd History, which this {{relation}} {{may make the}} more probable; and {{that is in the}} 2. Chapter of the 4. Book of his Natural History of Brasil, where he says, Porro præter tot documenta fertilitatis circa vegetabilia & sensitiva marina telluris æmula, accidit & illud, quod paucis à Paranambucensi milliaribus, piscatoris uncum citra intentionem contingat infigi vadis petrosis, & loco piscis spongia, coralla, aliasque arbusculas marinas capi. Inter hæc inusitatæ formæ prodit spongiosa arbuscula sesquipedis longitudinis, brevioribus radicibus, lapideis nitens vadis, & rupibus infixa, erigiturque in corpus spongiosum molle oblongum rotundum turbinatum: intus miris cancellis & alveis fabricatum, extus autem tenaci glutine instar Apum propolis undique vestitum, ostio satis patulo & profundo in summitate relicto, sicut ex altera iconum probe depicta videre licet (see the third and fourth Figures of the 27. Scheme.) Ita ut Apiarium marinum vere dixeris; primo enim intuitu è Mare ad Terram delatum, vermiculis scatebat cæruleis <b>parvis,</b> qui mox à calore solis in Muscas, vel Apes potius, easq; exiguas & nigras transformebantur, circumvolantesque evanescebant, ita ut de eorum mellificatione nihil certi conspici datum fuerit, cum tamen cærosa materia propolis Apumque cellæ manifeste apparerent, atque ipsa mellis qualiscunque substantia proculdubio urinatoribus patebit, ubi curiosius inquisiverint hæc apiaria, eaque in natali solo & salo diversis temporibus penitius lustrarint.|$|E
60|$|Now it must {{be obvious}} to a {{reflecting}} mind that every thing which is desperately immoral, being in its constitution monstrous, is of itself perishable: decay it cannot escape; and, further, it is liable to sudden dissolution: time would evince this in the instance before us; though not, perhaps, until infinite and irreparable harm had been done. But, even at present, each {{of the sources of}} this preternatural strength (as far as it is formidable to Europe) has its corresponding seat of weakness; which, were it fairly touched, would manifest itself immediately.--The power is indeed a Colossus: but, if the trunk be of molten-brass, the members are of clay; and would fall to pieces upon a shock which need not be violent. Great Britain, if her energies were properly called forth and directed, might (as we have already maintained) give this shock. 'Magna <b>parvis</b> obscurantur' was the appropriate motto (the device a Sun Eclipsed) when Lord Peterborough, with a handful of men opposed to fortified cities and large armies, brought a great part of Spain to acknowledge a sovereign of the House of Austria. We have now a vast military force; and,--even without a Peterborough or a Marlborough,--at this precious opportunity (when, as is daily more probable, {{a large portion of the}} French force must march northwards to combat Austria) we might easily, by expelling the French from the Peninsula, secure an immediate footing there for liberty; and the Pyrenees would then be shut against them for ever. The disciplined troops of Great Britain might overthrow the enemy in the field; while the Patriots of Spain, under wise management, would be able to consume him slowly but surely.|$|E
60|$|This scene {{opened by}} the illness of two girls, a {{daughter}} and niece of Mr. <b>Parvis,</b> the minister of Salem, who fell under an affliction {{similar to that of}} the Goodwins. Their mouths were stopped, their throats choked, their limbs racked, thorns were stuck into their flesh, and pins were ejected from their stomachs. An Indian and his wife, servants of the family, endeavouring, by some spell of their own, to discover by whom the fatal charm had been imposed on their master's children, drew themselves under suspicion, and were hanged. The judges and juries persevered, encouraged by the discovery of these poor Indians' guilt, and hoping they might thus expel from the colony the authors of such practices. They acted, says Mather, the historian, under a conscientious wish to do justly; but the cases of witchcraft and possession increased as if they were transmitted by contagion, and the same sort of spectral evidence being received which had occasioned the condemnation of the Indian woman Titu, became generally fatal. The afflicted persons failed not to see the spectres, as they were termed, of the persons by whom they were tormented. Against this species of evidence no alibi could be offered, because it was admitted, as we have said elsewhere, that the real persons of the accused were not there present; and everything rested upon the assumption that the afflicted persons were telling the truth, since their evidence could not be redargued. These spectres were generally represented as offering their victims a book, on signing which they would be freed from their torments. Sometimes the devil appeared in person, and added his own eloquence to move the afflicted persons to consent.|$|E
