5|$|In {{a further}} step, some NAD is {{converted}} into NADP by NAD kinase, which phosphorylates NAD. In most organisms, this enzyme uses ATP {{as the source}} of the phosphate group, although several bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii, use inorganic polyphosphate as an alternative <b>phosphoryl</b> donor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Phosphoryl</b> {{chloride}} (commonly called phosphorus oxychloride) is a {{colourless liquid}} with the formula 3. It hydrolyses in moist air releasing phosphoric acid and choking fumes of hydrogen chloride. It is manufactured industrially {{on a large}} scale from phosphorus trichloride and oxygen or phosphorus pentoxide. It is mainly used to make phosphate esters such as tricresyl phosphate.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} use for <b>phosphoryl</b> chloride {{is in the}} manufacture of triarylphosphate esters (as described above) such as triphenyl phosphate and tricresyl phosphate. These esters have been used for many years as flame retardants and plasticisers for PVC. Meanwhile, trialkyl esters such as tributyl phosphate (made similarly from n-butanol) are used as liquid–liquid extraction solvents in nuclear reprocessing and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Like phosphate, <b>phosphoryl</b> {{chloride}} is tetrahedral in shape. It features three P−Cl {{bonds and}} one strong P=O double bond, {{with an estimated}} bond dissociation energy of 533.5kJ/mol. On the basis of bond length and electronegativity, the Schomaker-Stevenson rule suggests that the double bond form is very dominant (in contrast with POF3). The P=O bond does not utilize the d-orbitals on phosphorus as is commonly described in older textbooks as quantum chemical calculations have shown that d-orbitals {{are not involved in}} main group chemical bonding (see Hypervalent molecule). More modern texts favour a description which involves the donation of the lone pair electrons from oxygen p-orbitals to the antibonding phosphorus-chlorine bonds thus constituting π bonding.|$|E
5|$|Several {{relatively}} simple chemical tests — commercially available as reagent testing kits — {{can be used}} to assess the presence of psilocybin in extracts prepared from mushrooms. The drug reacts in the Marquis test to produce a yellow color, and a green color in the Mandelin test. Neither of these tests, however, is specific for psilocybin; for example, the Marquis test will react with many classes of controlled drugs, such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings, including amphetamine and methamphetamine. Ehrlich's reagent and DMACA reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after thin layer chromatography. Many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples. Although the earliest methods commonly used gas chromatography, the high temperature required to vaporize the psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its <b>phosphoryl</b> group and become psilocin — making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs. In forensic toxicology, techniques involving gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures. These techniques include ion mobility spectrometry, capillary zone electrophoresis, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used with ultraviolet, fluorescence, electrochemical, and electrospray mass spectrometric detection methods.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phosphoryl</b> {{groups are}} {{transferred}} during PEPCK action, {{which is likely}} facilitated by the eclipsed conformation of the <b>phosphoryl</b> groups when ATP is bound to PEPCK.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} the above four {{reactions}} also affords phosphorus oxychloride (<b>phosphoryl</b> chloride), which resembles thionyl chloride in many of its reactions.|$|E
25|$|In the Bischler–Napieralski {{reaction}} an β-phenylethylamine is acylated and cyclodehydrated by a Lewis acid, such as <b>phosphoryl</b> chloride or phosphorus pentoxide. The resulting 1-substituted 3,4-dihydroisoquinoline {{can then}} be dehydrogenated using palladium. The following Bischler–Napieralski reaction produces papaverine.|$|E
25|$|Since the eclipsed {{formation}} {{is one that}} is high in energy, <b>phosphoryl</b> group transfer has a decreased energy of activation, meaning that the groups will transfer more readily. This transfer likely happens via a mechanism similar to SN2 displacement.|$|E
25|$|In B. subtilis, this pathway is {{regulated}} by a two-component system: DesK and DesR. DesK is a membrane-associated kinase and DesR is a transcriptional regulator of the des gene. The regulation responds to temperature; {{when there is}} a drop in temperature, this gene is upregulated. Unsaturated fatty acids increase the fluidity of the membrane and stabilize it under lower temperatures. DesK is the sensor protein that, {{when there is a}} decrease in temperature, will autophosphorylate. DesK-P will transfer its <b>phosphoryl</b> group to DesR. Two DesR-P proteins will dimerize and bind to the DNA promoters of the des gene and recruit RNA polymerase to begin transcription.|$|E
25|$|Organic cofactors {{may have}} been present even earlier {{in the history of}} life on Earth. The {{nucleotide}} adenosine is present in cofactors that catalyse many basic metabolic reactions such as methyl, acyl, and <b>phosphoryl</b> group transfer, as well as redox reactions. This ubiquitous chemical scaffold has, therefore, been proposed to be a remnant of the RNA world, with early ribozymes evolving to bind a restricted set of nucleotides and related compounds. Adenosine-based cofactors are thought to have acted as interchangeable adaptors that allowed enzymes and ribozymes to bind new cofactors through small modifications in existing adenosine-binding domains, which had originally evolved to bind a different cofactor. This process of adapting a pre-evolved structure for a novel use is known as exaptation.|$|E

500|$|In {{terms of}} its structure, ATP {{consists}} of an adenine attached by the 9-nitrogen atom to the 1′ carbon atom of a sugar (ribose), {{which in turn is}} attached at the 5′ carbon atom of the sugar to a triphosphate group. In its many reactions related to metabolism, the adenine and sugar groups remain unchanged, but the triphosphate is converted to di- and monophosphate, giving respectively the derivatives ADP and AMP. The three <b>phosphoryl</b> groups are referred to as the alpha (α), beta (β), and, for the terminal phosphate, gamma (γ).|$|E
500|$|American {{banker and}} amateur ethnomycologist R. Gordon Wasson {{and his wife}} Valentina studied the ritual use of psychoactive {{mushrooms}} by the native population in the Mazatec village Huautla de Jiménez. In 1957, Wasson described the psychedelic visions that he experienced during these rituals in [...] "Seeking the Magic Mushroom", {{an article published in}} the popular American weekly Life magazine. Later the same year they were accompanied on a follow-up expedition by French mycologist Roger Heim, who identified several of the mushrooms as Psilocybe species. Heim cultivated the mushrooms in France, and sent samples for analysis to Albert Hofmann, a chemist employed by the Swiss multinational pharmaceutical company Sandoz (now Novartis). Hofmann, who had in 1938 created LSD, led a research group that isolated and identified the psychoactive compounds from Psilocybe mexicana. Hofmann was aided in the discovery process by his willingness to ingest mushroom extracts to help verify the presence of the active compounds. He and his colleagues later synthesized a number of compounds chemically related to the naturally occurring psilocybin, to see how structural changes would affect psychoactivity. The new molecules differed from psilocybin in the position of the <b>phosphoryl</b> or hydroxyl group {{at the top of the}} indole ring, and in the numbers of methyl groups (CH3) and other additional carbon chains.|$|E
2500|$|This {{reaction}} converts glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate {{in preparation}} for phosphorylation to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. [...] The addition of the 2nd <b>phosphoryl</b> group to produce fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is an irreversible step, and so is used to irreversibly target the glucose 6-phosphate breakdown to provide energy for ATP production via glycolysis.|$|E
2500|$|Thionyl {{chloride}} converts phosphonic {{acids and}} phosphonates into <b>phosphoryl</b> chlorides. It {{is for this}} type of reaction that thionyl chloride is listed as a Schedule 3 compound, as it can be used in the [...] "di-di" [...] method of producing G-series nerve agents. For example, thionyl chloride converts dimethyl methylphosphonate into methylphosphonic acid dichloride, which can be used in the production of sarin and soman.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the body}} needs glucose for energy, {{glycogen}} phosphorylase, {{with the help}} of an orthophosphate, can cleave away a molecule from the glycogen chain. [...] The cleaved molecule is in the form of glucose-1-phosphate, which can be converted into G6P by phosphoglucomutase. [...] Next, the <b>phosphoryl</b> group on G6P can be cleaved by glucose-6-phosphatase so that a free glucose can be formed. [...] This free glucose can pass through membranes and can enter the bloodstream to travel to other places in the body.|$|E
2500|$|BglII catalyses {{phosphodiester bond}} {{cleavage}} at the DNA backbone through a <b>phosphoryl</b> transfer to water. Studies on {{the mechanism of}} restriction enzymes have revealed several general features {{that seem to be}} true in almost all cases, although the actual mechanism for each enzyme is most likely some variation of this general mechanism. This mechanism requires a base to generate the hydroxide ion from water, which will act as the nucleophile and attack the phosphorus in the phosphodiester bond. [...] Also required is a Lewis acid to stabilize the extra negative charge of the pentacoordinated transition state phosphorus, as well as a general acid or metal ion that stabilizes the leaving group (3’-O-).|$|E
2500|$|Tabun {{was made}} on an {{industrial}} scale by Germany during World War II, based on a process developed by Gerhard Schrader. In the chemical agent factory in Dyhernfurth an der Oder, codenamed [...] "Hochwerk", at least 12,000 metric tons of this agent were manufactured between 1942 and 1945. The manufacturing process consisted of two steps, the first being reaction of gaseous dimethylamine (1) with an excess of <b>phosphoryl</b> chloride (2), yielding dimethylamidophosphoric dichloride (3, codenamed [...] "Produkt 39" [...] or [...] "D 4") and dimethylammonium chloride (4). The dimethylamidophosphoric dichloride thus obtained was purified by vacuum distillation and thereafter transferred to the main Tabun production line. Here it was reacted with an excess of sodium cyanide (5), dispersed in dry chlorobenzene, yielding the intermediate dimethylamidophosphoric dicyanide (not depicted in the scheme) and sodium chloride (8); then, absolute ethanol (6) was added, reacting with the dimethylamidophosphoric dicyanide to yield tabun (7) and hydrogen cyanide (9). After the reaction, the mixture (consisting of about 75% chlorobenzene and 25% tabun, along with insoluble salts {{and the rest of}} the hydrogen cyanide) was filtered to remove the insoluble salts and vacuum-distilled to remove hydrogen cyanide and excess chlorobenzene, so yielding the technical product, consisting either of 95% tabun with 5% chlorobenzene (Tabun A) or (later in the war) of 80% tabun with 20% chlorobenzene (Tabun B).|$|E
50|$|A <b>phosphoryl</b> {{group is}} the {{chemical}} entity PO32−. It may exist in different protonation states. The term is usually {{used to refer to}} compounds in which the <b>phosphoryl</b> group is attached to other atoms, e.g. <b>phosphoryl</b> chloride, or in the description of catalytic mechanisms. In biochemical reactions involving phosphates (e.g. Adenosine triphosphate), a <b>phosphoryl</b> group is usually transferred between the substrates (<b>phosphoryl</b> transfer reactions). A <b>phosphoryl</b> group {{should not be confused with}} a phosphate group.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phosphoryl</b> {{groups are}} {{transferred}} during PEPCK action, {{which is likely}} facilitated by the eclipsed conformation of the <b>phosphoryl</b> groups when ATP is bound to PEPCK.|$|E
50|$|The {{anhydride}} <b>phosphoryl</b> difluoride oxide (P2O3F4) {{can react}} with oxides such as UO3 to yield difuorophosphates. <b>Phosphoryl</b> difluoride oxide also reacts with alkali fluorides to yield difluorophosphates.|$|E
50|$|Phosphoglucomutase effects a <b>phosphoryl</b> group shift by exchanging a <b>phosphoryl</b> {{group with}} the substrate. Isotopic {{labeling}} experiments have confirmed that this reaction proceeds through a glucose 1,6-bisphosphate intermediate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phosphoryl</b> nitride in {{chemistry}} is a reactive intermediate with the structure OPN. It is a linear oxygen phosphorus nitrogen molecule with a formal double bond between P and O (<b>phosphoryl)</b> and a triple bond (nitride) between P and N. It {{can be obtained}} in argon matrix isolation at 16 K by laser photolysis of <b>phosphoryl</b> triazide, OP(N3)3. OPN and its isomer ONP can interconvert by photoisomerization.|$|E
5000|$|Glu53 {{performs}} base catalysis to deprotonate the hydroxyl group, {{which allows}} the now nucleophilic oxygen from the nucleoside 5' hydroxyl group to attack {{the end of the}} phosphate chain (gamma phosphate) on the <b>phosphoryl</b> donor (e.g. ATP or UTP). This has deemed the [...] "closed" [...] conformation as the catalytically active conformation since it catalyzes the <b>phosphoryl</b> transfer between <b>phosphoryl</b> donors and receiving nucleosides. Similarly, [...] "open" [...] conformation is generally referred to as the catalytically inactive form since Glu53 is not in close proximity to nucleoside 5' hydroxyl group and will not catalyze the <b>phosphoryl</b> transfer.|$|E
50|$|The <b>phosphoryl</b> {{group on}} PEP is {{eventually}} {{transferred to the}} imported sugar via several proteins. The <b>phosphoryl</b> group is transferred to the Enzyme E I (EI), Histidine Protein (HPr, Heat-stable Protein) and Enzyme E II (EII) to a conserved histidine residue, whereas in the Enzyme E II B (EIIB) the <b>phosphoryl</b> group is usually transferred to a cysteine residue and rarely to a histidine.In the process of glucose PTS transport specific of enteric bacteria, PEP transfers its <b>phosphoryl</b> to a histidine residue on EI. EI in turn transfers the phosphate to HPr. From HPr the <b>phosphoryl</b> is transferred to EIIA. EIIA is specific for glucose and it further transfers the <b>phosphoryl</b> group to a juxtamembrane EIIB. Finally, EIIB phosphorylates glucose as it crosses the plasma membrane through the transmembrane Enzyme II C (EIIC), forming glucose-6-phosphate. The benefit of transforming glucose into glucose-6-phosphate {{is that it will}} not leak out of the cell, therefore providing a one-way concentration gradient of glucose. The HPr is common to the phosphotransferase systems of the other substrates mentioned earlier, as is the upstream EI.|$|E
50|$|Some enzymes can be {{phosphorylated}} {{in multiple}} sites. The {{presence of a}} <b>phosphoryl</b> group {{in a part of}} a protein may depend on the folding of the enzyme (which can make the protein more or less accessible to kinase proteins) and the proximity of other <b>phosphoryl</b> groups.|$|E

5000|$|The {{bacterial}} phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a multi-protein system {{involved in}} the regulation {{of a variety of}} metabolic and transcriptional processes. The PTS catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell membrane. The general mechanism of the PTS is the following: a <b>phosphoryl</b> group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is transferred to enzyme-I (EI) of PTS which in turn transfers it to a <b>phosphoryl</b> carrier protein (HPr). Phospho-HPr then transfers the <b>phosphoryl</b> group to a sugar-specific permease which consists of at least three structurally distinct domains (IIA, IIB, and IIC) [...] which can either be fused together in a single polypeptide chain or exist as two or three interactive chains, formerly called enzymes II (EII) and III (EIII). The IIC domain catalyzes the transfer of a <b>phosphoryl</b> group from IIB to the sugar substrate.|$|E
