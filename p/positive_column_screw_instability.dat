40|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>instability</b> of the {{magnetic}} field connecting a rotating black hole (BH) with its surrounding disk is discussed based {{on the model of}} the coexistence of the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process and {{the magnetic}} coupling (MC) process (CEBZMC). A criterion for the <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> with the state of CEBZMC is derived based on the calculations of the poloidal and toroidal components {{of the magnetic}} field on the disk. It is shown by the criterion that the <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> will occur, if the BH spin and the power-law index for the variation of the magnetic field on the disk are greater than some critical values. It turns out that the instability occurs outside some critical radii on the disk. It is argued that the state of CEBZMC always accompanies the <b>screw</b> <b>instability.</b> In addtition, we show that the <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> contributes {{only a small fraction of}} magnetic extraction of energy from a rotating BH.

40|$|A toy {{model for}} gamma-ray burst supernovae (GRB-SNe) is {{discussed}} {{by considering the}} effects of <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> of magnetic field in black hole (BH) magnetosphere. The <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> in the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process (henceforth SIBZ) can coexist with the <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> in the magnetic coupling (MC) process (henceforth SIMC). It turns out that both SIBZ and SIMC occur inevitably, provided that the following parameters are greater than some critical values, i. e., (i) the BH spin, (ii) the power-law index describing the magnetic field at the disk, and (iii) the vertical height of the astrophysical load above the equatorial plane of the rotating BH. The features of several GRBs are well fitted. In our model the durations of the long GRBs depend on the evolve time of the half-opening angle. A small fraction of energy is extracted from the BH via the BZ process to power a GRB, while a large fraction of energy is extracted from the BH via the MC process to power an associated supernova. In addition, the variability time scales of tens of msec in the light curves of the GRBs are fitted by two successive flares due to SIBZ. Comment: 22 pages, 5 figures.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a novel geometric analysis method of the singularity and kinestatic characteristics of robots. For non-redundant robots, there exist two uniquely determined Jacobians – the screw-based Jacobian and the reciprocal Jacobian. Here, it is shown that {{if some of}} the reciprocal products between the <b>column</b> <b>screws</b> of the two Jacobians are close to zero, the robot is in the vicinity of a singular configuration and the corresponding columns of the Jacobian are involved in the singularity. From this observation, an invariant measure of closeness to a singularity is presented using the reciprocal products. Furthermore, by considering the reciprocal products between the actuated joint <b>screws</b> and <b>column</b> <b>screws</b> of the Jacobian, this measure is extended so that the concept of the kinestatic characterization index is presented for parallel robots. Since it is defined as the ratio of reciprocal products from the uniqueness of the two Jacobians, it represents a unique invariant characteristic of robots. From the singularity analyses of the planar 4 -bar linkage and the 3 -DOF parallel manipulator with PRS-serial chains, the validity of the proposed index is examined and the concept of a kinestatically balanced configuration is introduced as well...|$|R

40|$|Compressive {{acoustic}} pulses {{were produced}} by an impulsive abnormal-glow discharge {{and the interaction}} of these pulses with the <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> of a dc neon glow discharge was studied. The acoustic pulses are analyzed and {{are found to be}} infinitesimal amplitude perturbations. The mechanism of the acoustic interaction is described in terms of existent theories of the <b>positive</b> <b>column.</b> It is found that the presence of the acoustic pulse in the <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> creates small spatially-separated regions of increased electron temperature and electron density, which move through the plasma in company with the acoustic pulse. It is shown that amplification of the wave of stratification produced in the interaction may, in many cases, depend upon this spatial separation phenomenon. An attempt was made to observe amplification of the acoustic pulses caused by their propagation through the plasma. [URL] United States Naval Reserv...|$|R

The steady state of a non-isothermal, cylindrical <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> in an axial magnetic field is described by three moment equations in the plasma approximation. Volume generation of electron-ion pairs by single-stage ionization, the presence of axial current, and collisions with neutrals are considered.

It yields radial profiles of the charged particle velocities, density, potential, electron and ion temperatures, and demonstrates similarity laws for the <b>positive</b> <b>column.</b> The results are compared with two moment theories and with experimental data on He, Ar and Hg {{found in the literature}} {{for a wide range of}} pressures.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMoving striations and anode oscillations were studied {{over a wide}} range of gas pressures and discharge currents in an argon glow discharge. Striation spacing, frequency and velocity were measured as a function of discharge current from low currents to the current for extinction of moving striations, for pressures from 1 to 16 mm Hg. Striation frequency was also measured as a function of pressure for various radii discharge tubes. The anode spot light oscillations were eliminated by use of an auxiliary anode discharge, which brought the <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> in contact with the anode and eliminated the oscillat­ing anode fall in potential. This change in the anode region produced no significant change in the striation parameters, but greatly reduced and altered the frequency of the poten­tial oscillations across the discharge tube. The potential oscillations now followed the wave form and frequency of the striation oscillations instead of the frequency of the anode spot oscillations. By use of a discharge tube, constructed with sections of different radius, moving striations in the <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> were isolated from both cathode and anode by sections of homogenous <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> in which no voltage oscillations were detectable by floating probes. This leads to the con­clusion that striations are due to an inherent instability of the <b>positive</b> <b>column,</b> and not to the effects developed by the anode or cathode.

40|$|The {{electron}} energy distribution function (EEDF) in a <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> of low-pressure and discharge current is determined {{not only by}} the local collision processes and the axial electric field action, but also by the transport phenomenon, the radial ambipolar diffusion due to the gradient of plasma density. Thus, to completely determine the EEDF, the Boltzmann equation including radial inhomogeneity terms has to be solved. The present work proposes a simplified method to account for the radial inhomogeneity, when the electron kinetics in {{the central part of the}} <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> can be reduced to be one energy-dimensional. The radial diffusion of electrons is taken into account via a wall loss term. A greatly simplified kinetic equation is obtained and its numerical solutions agree well with the EEDF determined from Langmuir probe measurements in a helium dc discharge <b>positive</b> <b>column.</b> Also, a comparison of the present method with local and nonlocal approach theories is made. A discrepancy is observed, especially at high energies, where either local or nonlocal approach theories predict too-large values of EEDF...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a global model of micro-hollow cathode discharges working in argon gas. Inspired by experiments and two-dimensional numerical simulations, the discharge is decomposed into two main regions, labelled the cathodic {{region and the}} <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> region. The first is composed of a cathode sheath (surrounding the cathode) and a plasma in the centre, while the <b>positive</b> <b>column</b> region is essentially filled with plasma. A cathode sheath model is developed to calculate the sheath size and the power dissipated by ions and electrons in the sheath. Charged-particle transport equations are solved in one-dimensional cylindrical coordinates, in the quasi-neutral plasma region, {{in order to determine}} the radial density profiles and the electron temperature in the microhole. A global power balance is then performed in the two distinct regions {{in order to determine the}} absolute electron density. We found that the electron density is one order of magnitude higher in the cathodic region than in the <b>positive</b> <b>column,</b> showing that the power dissipation is mainly located in the cathode sheath.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether one can achieve stable fixation of a two column (transverse) acetabular fracture by only fixing a single column with a locking plate and unicortical locking screws. We hypothesized that a locking plate applied to the anterior column of a transverse acetabular fracture would create a construct that is more rigid than a non-locking plate, and that this construct would be biomechanically comparable to two column fixation. Methods Using urethane foam models of the pelvis, we simulated transverse acetabular fractures and stabilized them with 1) an anterior column plate with bicortical screws, 2) an anterior locking plate with unicortical screws, 3) an anterior plate and posterior <b>column</b> lag <b>screw,</b> and 4) a posterior plate with an anterior <b>column</b> lag <b>screw.</b> These constructs were mechanically loaded on a servohydraulic material testing machine. Construct stiffness and fracture displacement were measured. Result and Discussion We found that two column fixation is 54 % stiffer than a single column fixation with a conventional plate with bicortical screws. There was no significant difference between fixation with an anterior column locking plate with unicortical screws and an anterior plate with posterior <b>column</b> lag <b>screw.</b> We detected a non-significant trend towards more stiffness for the anterior locking plate compared to the anterior non-locking plate. Conclusion In conclusion, a locking plate construct of the anterior column provides less stability than a traditional both column construct with posterior plate and anterior <b>column</b> lag <b>screw.</b> However, the locking construct offers greater strength than a non-locking, bicortical construct, which in addition often requires extensive contouring and its application is oftentimes accompanied by the risk of neurovascular damage. </p...|$|R
