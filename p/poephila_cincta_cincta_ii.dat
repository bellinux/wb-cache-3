40|$|The Black-throated Finch (Southern) (<b>Poephila</b> <b>cincta</b> <b>cincta)</b> is {{threatened}} by the substantial landscape changes in northern Australia. We developed 16 polymorphic microsatellite markers using 454 -shotgun whole-genome sequencing technology. We identified an average of 4. 7 alleles per locus based on 63 wild caught individuals from Townsville, Queensland. Thirteen and 9 markers were also successfully cross-amplified in two confamilial species, the Double-barred Finch (Taeniopygia bichenovii) and the chestnut-breasted Mannikin (Lonchura castaneothorax) with 11 and 5 were polymorphic, respectively. These markers will help understand the population genetic structure of the endangered Black-throated Finch and determine genetic consequences of landscape changes for the species.

40|$|Where {{threatened}} biodiversity is {{adversely affected}} by development, policies often state that "no net loss" should be the goal and biodiversity offsetting is one mechanism available to achieve this. However, developments are often approved on an ad hoc basis and cumulative impacts are not sufficiently examined. We demonstrate the potential for serious threat to an endangered subspecies when multiple developments are planned. We modelled {{the distribution of the}} black-throated finch (<b>Poephila</b> <b>cincta</b> <b>cincta)</b> using bioclimatic data and Queensland's Regional Ecosystem classification. We overlaid granted, extant extractive and exploratory mining tenures within the known and modelled ranges of black-throated finches to examine the level of incipient threat to this subspecies in central Queensland, Australia. Our models indicate {{that more than half of}} the remaining P. <b>cincta</b> <b>cincta</b> habitat is currently under extractive or exploratory tenure. Therefore, insufficient habitat exists to offset all potential development so "no net loss" is not possible. This has implications for future conservation of this and similarly distributed species and for resource development planning, especially the use of legislated offsets for biodiversity protection...|$|R

40|$|Landscape {{genetics}} investigates {{relationships between}} population processes and landscape structure. I use {{this approach to}} understand the role of specific landscape features and environmental conditions in affecting population connectivity, gene flow and movements of a threatened species. The Black-throated Finch, both northern (<b>Poephila</b> <b>cincta</b> atropygialis) and southern subspecies (P. c. <b>cincta),</b> has subjected to many threatening processes over the last decade, especially the southern form. The decline of P. c. <b>cincta</b> {{is believed to be}} primarily due to overgrazing of riparian grassland, clearing and habitat fragmentation. The genetic consequence of the decline is unknown. I use molecular data to identify population structure; to quantify gene flow between remnant populations; and to understand how these dynamics are related to landscape features. With the analysis of landscape genetics, I can understand the extent of genetic impacts from environmental disturbance, the way in which birds use landscapes, and how viable and differentiate the existing populations are...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{movement}} patterns and home range of species is paramount in ecology; {{it is particularly}} important for threatened taxa {{as it can provide}} valuable information for conservation management. To address this knowledge gap for a range-restricted endangered bird, we estimated home range size, daily {{movement patterns}} and habitat use of a granivorous subspecies in northeast Australia, the black-throated finch (<b>Poephila</b> <b>cincta</b> cincta; BTF) using radio-tracking and re-sighting of colour banded birds. Little is known about basic aspects of its ecology including movement patterns and home range sizes. From 2011 - 2014 we colour-banded 102 BTF and radio-tracked 15 birds. We generated home ranges (calculated using kernel and Minimum Convex Polygons techniques of the 15 tracked BTF). More than 50 % of the re-sightings occurred within 200 m of the banding site (n = 51 out of 93 events) and within 100 days of capture. Mean home-range estimates with kernel (50 %, 95 % probability) and Minimum Convex Polygons were 10. 59 ha, 50. 79 ha and 46. 27 ha, respectively. Home range size differed between two capture sites but no seasonal differences were observed. BTF home ranges overlapped four habitat types among eight available. Habitat selection was different from random at Site 1 (χ 2 = 373. 41, df = 42, p< 0. 001) and Site 2 (χ 2 = 1896. 1, df = 45, p< 0. 001); however, the preferred habitats differed between the two sites. BTF moved further than expected on the basis of current knowledge, with three individuals being resighted over 15 km from the banding location. However, BTF maintain small home ranges over short time-frames. Occasional long-distance movements may be related to resource bottleneck periods. Daily movement patterns differed between sites, which is likely linked {{to the fact that the}} sites differ in the spatial distribution of resources. The work provides information about home range sizes and local movement of BTF that will be valuable for targeting effective management and conservation strategies for this endangered granivore...|$|R
40|$|Extract] The Australian Centre for Tropical Freshwater Research (ACTFR), James Cook University of North Queensland, Townsville, {{was engaged}} by the Department of Natural Resources to {{undertake}} a flora and fauna survey of two parcels of land, the Inkerman and Molongle blocks, associated with the potential future development of the Elliott Main Channel. The study area lie within the Brigalow Belt bioregion, a large and complex area that encompasses much of the 500 - 750 mm per annum rainfall country from the Queensland-New South Wales border to Townsville. The survey of the Inkerman and Molongle blocks was required, via field survey and literature review, to: identify common and significant flora and fauna species, habitat and communities; identify core and non-core conservation areas including significant communities, wildlife corridors or other areas of value requiring protection or careful management; and provide recommendations for the future sustainable management of the study areas. The vegetation survey identified a rare grass species, (POACEAE Dichanthium setosum) in the understorey of vegetation type Melaleuca spp., Corymbia tessellarisand vine thicket species on creek banks (Inkerman community description 7 and Molongle 5 a community description 5). In addition, four plant species collected were new records for the North Kennedy region: Malvaceae Abelmoschus moschatus; Marsileaceae Marsilea drummondii; Poaceae Sporobolus disjunctus; and Combretaceae Terminalia platyphylla. A total of 15 broad vegetation types were recorded from the study areas: in Molongle 5 a, six vegetation types, five of which were of bioregional conservation status and four of provincial (moderate to high) conservation significance; Molongle 5 b, eight vegetation types, three of which were of bioregional conservation status and seven of provincial (moderateto very high) conservation significance; and in Inkerman, eleven vegetation types, six of which were of bioregional conservation status and four of provincial conservation significnace. The vertebrate fauna survey recorded a total of 138 vertebrate fauna species, comprising of 24 mammal species, 101 bird species, 6 amphibian species and 7 reptile species were recorded during the field survey. In addition, 41 specimens (comprising 14 mammals, 16 birds, 1 amphibians, 10 reptiles) were identified for the areas from the Queensland Museum database {{and a total of}} 392 species (292 birds, 56 mammals, 34 reptiles and 10 amphibians) for the Lower Burdekin Region from literature sources. From the field survey and a review of secondary sources 13 species of conservation significance were identified for the Inkerman and Molongle areas: Northern Quoll Dasyurus hallucatus; Squirrel Glider Petaurus norfolcensis; Greater Glider Petauroides volans; Spectacled hare-wallaby Lagorchestes conspicillatus; Koala Phascolarctus cinereus; Bare-rumped Sheath-tailed BatSaccolaimus saccolaimus; Red Goshawk Erythrotriorchis radiatus; Square-tailed Kite Lophoictinia isura; Black-chinned Honeyeater Melithreptus gularis; Black-throated Finch <b>Poephila</b> <b>cincta</b> cincta; Ground Cuckoo-shrike Coracina maxima; Squatter Pigeon (southern subspecies) Geophaps scripta scripta; and Rufous Owl (eastern subsp.) Ninox rufa queenslandica. The report recommends that any future development in these areas associated with the extension of the Elliott Main Channel should incorporate a reserve systems that: •protects all 'endangered' regional ecosystems and a proportion of those that are 'of concern' that maximises their representation; •represents the diversity of regional ecosystems and vegetation types in the area and should also include portions of those regional ecosystems of 'no concern at present' and examples of all significant habitat types; that is connected to larger areas of more intact vegetation and habitat outside the development blocks; •has at least one continuous link from coastal to upland areas to act as a wildlife corridor; •is of a viable size that will again prevent its susceptibility to degradation via stochastic events and support in itself a stable fauna assemblage. In addition, the following recommendations were made in regards to the sustainable management of the study area for nature conservation: •develop and implement clear guidelines for the management and monitoring of these reserves such a new or pre-existing Environmental Management Plan; •consider the prospect of rehabilitation of degraded sites within the study area, particularly if some sites of conservation significance will be degraded or disturbed {{as a consequence of the}} Elliott Main Channel extension; •develop complementary community education programs to educate of local land-owners and community members as to the values and importance of conservation reserves in their local area; and •develop of long-term monitoring programs examining the viability and functioning of flora and fauna communities, together with an assessment of the effectiveness of environmental management guidelines, within any reserve systems...|$|R
