50|$|One {{interesting}} {{feature is}} a second margin at the 35th character, allowing lines to be limited between {{the left side of}} the screen and that point for margin 0, or that point and the right side of the screen for margin 1. This is useful for mixing graphics and text, or displaying two columns of text. Switching between the columns was accomplished by moving to the very last line in any given column and <b>pressing</b> <b>line</b> feed. The cursor would then reappear at the top of the next column. There was no attempt to limit drawing within these borders, so it was up to the host software to ensure lines remained within the margins by inserting CR/LF characters at appropriate points. Lines writing to margin 0 would extend the full length of the screen if CR/LF was not sent to wrap before he 35th character, although any data in the margin 1 area on the same line, being written later, would be drawn on top.|$|E

40|$|Lightweight {{boards and}} beams in the wood-based {{construction}} and furniture industry {{are not a}} new topic. The density reduction of panels using sandwich structure with light cores was confirmed by users like doors or mobile homes {{more than three decades}} ago. Today many ways to attain a lighter wooden structure are on offer, partially in industrial application. The first one is the use of light-weight wood species like balsa, lime, pine from southern hemisphere plantations etc. limited by the availability, strength properties, gluability and so on. A second one is the sandwich structure made from hard faces like thick veneer, thin plywood, particleboard or high density thin fiberboard and cores made from honeycomb paper, very light wood species or foams like the polystyrene one. A third way to produce a light structure is to reduce the core drastically, using predesigned skeletons with special shapes and connections to the faces. The engines for these developments are on the one hand the fast growing market of knockdown furniture {{and on the other hand}} the increasing costs for energy and raw materials. Additional factors that make weight saving a primary economical objective for most producers are transportation costs, easier handling and higher acceptance among the end users. Moreover, customers demand more for ergonomical solutions regarding packaging. Many patents were generated by researchers and developers for new one-stage production processes for sandwich panels with wood- and impregnated paper-based facings made from veneers, particles or fibres and a core consisting of expandable foams, particles or embedded hard skeletons. These ideas or prototypes could be integrated in existing continuous <b>pressing</b> <b>lines</b> for wood based panels keeping some of the advantages of the continuous production technique in matters of efficiency. Some of the challenges of the light weight wooden structure are the connection in half or final parts, resistance to water, moisture, temperature and fire, and maybe last but not least the recyclability due to the mixture of different materials like foams, plastics etc...|$|R

50|$|This {{period in}} 1846 {{was the time}} of the railway mania, when all manner of railway schemes were being {{promoted}} with the promise, often unfulfilled, of making subscribers rich. The LSWR was not to be left behind, and now was <b>pressing</b> the Richmond <b>line</b> westwards, but was beset with multiple independent schemes competing for the same territory. These included, an 1846 'Windsor, Slough and Staines Atmospheric Railway' company which would probably have used broad gauge. However it was induced by the 'Richmond and Staines Junction Railway' company to form a joint venture, the Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway company (WS&SWR), rebuffing the overtures of an atmospheric railway. The new company was friendly to the LSWR and had Joseph Locke as its engineer.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel multi-layered metal mesh achromatic half wave plate {{for use in}} astronomical polarimetric instruments. The half wave plate is designed to operate across the frequency range from 125 - 250 GHz. The wave plate is manufactured from 12 -layers of thin film metallic inductive and capacitive grids patterned onto polypropylene sheets, which are then bonded together using a hot <b>pressing</b> technique. Transmission <b>line</b> modelling and 3 -D electromagnetic simulations are used to optimize {{the parameters of the}} metal-mesh patterns and to evaluate their optical properties. A prototype half wave plate has been fabricated and its performance characterized in a polarizing Fourier transform spectrometer. The device performance is consistent with the modelling although the measured differential phase shift for two orthogonal polarizations is lower than expected. This difference is likely to result from imperfect patterning of individual layers and misalignment of the grids during manufacture. Comment: 14 pages, 13 Figures, 1 Tabl...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The article {{analyzes}} practical {{research of}} even wear of disc brake friction linings. The research {{was carried out}} to test the theoretical research regarding providing of even wear changing the pressing force application coordinates. Two kinds of the friction body (friction lining on steel base) construction were tested in experimental work. The friction body and brake lever are linked with a pin. The direction of this pin is perpendicular regarding the vector of slipping velocity in the first kind of the construction and parallel – in the second case. The research is significant to the joint-stock company “Jelgava engineering plant ” (A/S “Jelgavas masinbuves rupnica”) – they produce brakes with such construction. The experimental work {{was carried out in}} the brake testing laboratory of this company. The author proved {{that it is possible to}} provide even wear of friction lining if the design of the friction body is made so that the resultant force is applied with a definite eccentricity regarding the mass center of the friction lining. The eccentricity depends on the friction body design and friction material properties. Key words: disc brake, friction pair, wear, friction <b>lining,</b> <b>pressing</b> force...|$|R
40|$|Continuous fibre {{reinforced}} thermoplastics are a high competitive material {{class for}} diversified applications {{because of their}} inherent properties like light-weight construction potential, integral design, corrosion resistance and high energy absorption level. Using these materials, one approach towards a large volume scaled part production rate is covered by an automated process line, consisting of a pressing process for semi-finished sheet material production, a thermoforming step and some additional joining technologies. To allow short cycle times in the thermoforming step, the utilised semi-finished sheet materials, which are {{often referred to as}} 'oganic sheets', have to be fully impregnated and consolidated. Nowadays even this combination of outstanding physical and chemical material properties combined with the economic processing technology are no guarantee for the break-through of continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastics, mainly because of the high material costs for the semi-finished sheet materials. These costs can be attributed to a non adapted material selection or choice of process parameters, as well as by unfavourable pressing process type itself. Therefore the aim of the present investigations was to generate some alternatives regarding the choice of raw materials, the set-up or the selection of the <b>pressing</b> process <b>line</b> and to provide some theoretical tools for the determination of process parameters and dimensions. Concerning raw material aspects, the use of the blending technology is one promising approach towards cost reduction for the matrix component. Novel characteristics related to the fibre structure are CF-yarns with high filament numbers (e. g. 6 K or 12 K instead of 3 K) or multiaxial fibre orientations. These two approaches were both conducted for sheet materials with carbon fibre reinforcement and high temperature thermoplastics. Two new developed ternary blend matrices consisting of PEEK and PEI as the main ingredients were tested in comparison with neat PEEK. PES and PSU were used as the third blend component, which provides a cost reduction potential approximately 30 % compared to the basis PEEK polymer. (orig.)

60|$|All {{this time}} Pyrrhus {{was near the}} rear of his troops, and thus was in some degree removed from the {{greatest}} severity of the pressure. He turned and fought, from time to time, with those who were <b>pressing</b> upon his <b>line</b> from behind. As the danger became more imminent, he took out from his helmet the plume by which he was distinguished from the other generals, {{and gave it to}} a friend who was near him, in order that he might be a less conspicuous mark for the shafts of his enemies. The combats, however, between his party and those who were harassing them in the rear were still continued; and at length, in one of them, a man of Argos wounded him, by throwing a javelin with so much force that the point of it passed through his breast-plate and entered his side. The wound was not dangerous, but it had the effect of maddening Pyrrhus against the man who had inflicted it, and he turned upon him with great fury, as if he were intending to annihilate him at a blow. He would very probably have killed the Greek, had it not been that just at that moment the mother of the man, by a very singular coincidence, was surveying the scene from a house-top which overlooked the street where these events were occurring. She immediately seized a heavy tile from the roof, and with all her strength hurled it into the street upon Pyrrhus just as he was striking the blow. The tile came down upon his head, and, striking the helmet heavily, it carried both helmet and head down together, and crushed the lower vertebræ of the neck at their junction with the spine.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{summarising}} {{investigation of}} the events of the phase transition of the first order that occur in the critical region below the liquid-gas critical point. The grand partition function has been completely integrated in the phase-space of the collective variables. The basic density measure is the quartic one. It has the form of the exponent function with the first, second, third and fourth degree of the collective variables. The problem has been reduced to the Ising model in an external field, the role of which is played by the generalised chemical potential μ*. The line μ*(η) = 0, where η is the density, is the line of the phase transition. We consider the isothermal compression of the gas till the point where the phase transition on the line μ*(η) = 0 is reached. When the path of the <b>pressing</b> reaches the <b>line</b> μ* = 0 in the gas medium, a droplet of liquid springs up. The work for its formation is obtained, the surface-tension energy is calculated. On the line μ* = 0 we have a two-phase system: the gas and the liquid (the droplet) one. The equality of the gas and of the liquid chemical potentials is proved. The process of pressing is going on. But the pressure inside the system has stopped, two fixed densities have arisen: one for the gas-phase η G =η c (1 -d/ 2) and the other for the liquid-phase η L =η c (1 +d/ 2) (symmetrically to the rectlinear diameter), where η c = 0. 13044 is the critical density. Starting from that moment the external pressure works as a latent work of pressure. Its value is obtained. As a result, the gas-phase disappears and the whole system turns into liquid. The jump of the density is equal to η c d, where d=(D/ 2 G) 1 / 2 ~ τ ν/ 2. D and G are coefficients of the Hamiltonian in the last cell connected with the renormalisation-group symmetry.

2500|$|The {{legacy that}} Cruyff gave Barcelona, however, was {{about more than}} just trophies and records, as he gave Barça a winning mentality and footballing identity/ideology that runs through the club till this day. As Barcelona manager, he laid {{systematic}} foundations for a prominent school of football: [...] "Barçajax school" [...] or [...] "Barça-Ajax school", as it has been termed by many. The predominant style of play, now known as tiki-taka or tiqui-taca, had been transferred and improved from Ajax to Barça. It was that which has sustained Barcelona since the days of Vic Buckingham, Rinus Michels and Cruyff (as player) in the early 1970s: they were the ideas of Ajax; Total Football, a predominant belief in possession-oriented football with an attack-minded 3–4–3/4–3–3 team formation, rooted in a high offside <b>line,</b> <b>pressing</b> and the interchange of players on the field. When Cruyff became Barcelona’s manager in 1988, he reinforced this footballing philosophy. He was also responsible for introducing “rondos” (a circle of players pass the ball to each other, while one in the centre tries to catch it) into the team's training sessions. About Cruyff's lasting influence on Barça's youth academy La Masia, Guillem Balagué noted, [...] "Cruyff demanded changes at the academy and La Masía began regularly producing the players he wanted as well as providing the kids with a sound education, dual ambitions of the Dutch coach and the club. “The player who has come through La Masía has something different from the rest, it's a plus that only comes from having competed in a Barcelona shirt from the time you were a child,” says Guardiola. He is talking not only about the understanding of the game and their ability, but about human qualities. The players who go through La Masía are taught to behave with civility and humility. The theory being that, not only is it pleasant to be unassuming, but also if you are humble, you are capable of learning – and the capacity to learn is the capacity to improve. If you aren't capable of learning you won't improve. Since his arrival, Johan had tried and succeeded in convincing the club to train all the junior teams {{in the same way as}} the first eleven – and to favour talent over physique.” ...|$|R
