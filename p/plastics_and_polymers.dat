40|$|The polymer {{industry}} {{is growing at}} an extremely large rate and with the recycling of <b>plastics</b> <b>and</b> <b>polymers</b> from packaging and containers at an all time high, {{there is a greater}} need to understand the physical elements that affect the structure of these polymers. There has been much previous work in the field of crystallisation, glass transition and polymer ageing. Many scientists have studied their findings on the work of L. C. E Struik who led the way in polymer science. However, there has been, as far as research shows, no work on Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) and the effects ageing can have on this polymer. Two sets of testing were performed, the first on a Thermo-mechanical Analyser (TMA) and the second on a Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). The glasstransition temperatures and physical ageing effects were tested on the TMA, whilst on the DSC, only the physical ageing effects were tested. During the ageing experiments 3 samples of varying crystallinity were created, one sample was completely amorphous (0 % crystalline), the other samples were 28 % crystalline and 65 % crystalline. The results showed that physical ageing can take place in PET. The definitive conclusion is that as the crystallinity increased the amount of ageing decreased. This shows that physical ageing primarily affects the amorphous regions of polymers; it is here that there is no organisation within the microstructure giving molecules larger areas of free volume to occupy...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} plasmas {{are powerful}} tools for the activation of various material surfaces and thus allow {{significant increase in}} adhesion of glues or lacquers. Such increase is mainly due to a plasma-induced formation of polar groups at the surface. However, the activation of complexly-shaped free-form surfaces, which is quite easily to be realized in low-pressure plasma chambers, can become a challenging task when working at atmospheric pressure. In this chapter, we present several approaches for such free-form plasma activation of different <b>plastics</b> <b>and</b> <b>polymers</b> based on direct and indirect dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasmas. Here, the use of DBDs allows the treatment of temperature-sensitive materials due to the marginal gas temperatures {{of this type of}} plasma discharge. First, a basic comparison of the efficiency of direct and indirect plasma treatment of polymers is given where the particularly obtained changes in surface energy, polarity and adhesion pull strength of applied lacquers are presented and discussed in more detail. Second, selected geometries of plasma devices for the activation of quasi free-form surfaces and the respective characteristics and perfomances of these devices are demonstrated: For the activation of 3 D-shaped objects, a hand-held plasma device with a specifically designed roll-shaped discharge geometry is introduced. Here, the curved electrode surface conforms to Paschen’s law for plasma ignition at least one location at all times. So an easy use and the applicability on free form surfaces are enabled. Further, a foldable multiple pin plasma source which can be adapted to cylindrical work pieces with a minimum radius of 15 mm is presented. This source allows a large-scale treatment. Moreover, the guiding of indirect plasmas (jets) within flexible tubes is discussed. It is shown that such guiding can be performed for tube lengths of several tens of centimeters without any loss in efficiency of the plasma. Indirect plasmas can thus easily be brought to regions of interest of complexely-shaped free-form work piece surfaces where the plasma source itself cannot be used, for example due to restrictions of the accessible space in the case of bore holes or undercuts. In addition to the characterization of these plasma sources, the particular treatment efficiencies are presented by means of contact angle and surface energy measurements...|$|E
40|$|The creep of {{materials}} {{is a research}} topic of major significance in the life assessment and design of many modern engineering components of advance technology such as: power generation plant, chemical plant, gas turbines, jet engines, spacecraft, components made of <b>plastics</b> <b>and</b> <b>polymers,</b> etc. To predict the creep lives of such components, one necessary ingredient is a creep damage model. The current creep damage models are either too cumbersome to be readily employed and/or not sufficiently accurate for practical applications. This thesis describes a new creep damage model to overcome {{some of the major}} shortcomings in current creep damage/life prediction methods. The proposed model is relatively simple and readily applicable to industrial cases yet it is sufficiently accurate. The proposed model assumes that, on a macroscopic level, the energy dissipated in the material may be taken as a measure of creep damage induced in the material. In another words, creep damage is directly proportional to the absorbed internal energy density (IED), i. e., the internal energy per unit of volume. In this way, the model takes into account both multi-axial loading and deformation. The model is formulated when the creep constitutive relationships may be expressed by primary plus steady-state or steady-state alone (IED-SS) {{as well as for the}} cases when the material behaviour includes the creep tertiary region (IED-T). The proposed model has been verified by applying it to various components for which the experimental creep lives are available from literature including thick/thin cylindrical vessels, notch bars with various notch-root radii and materials, multi-material cross welds bars, and perforated biaxial plates. The predicted creep lives of these components by the proposed model (IED-SS and IED-T) are compared with the experimental results and those obtained by the Reference Stress Method (RSM). It is shown that the maximum errors in relation to the creep lives of the above-mentioned components are: 18 % when IED-SS is applied, 38 % when IED-T is applied, and 301 % when RSM is applied. To estimate the effects of uncertainties in material data on the predicted creep life, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted. To this end and in relation to Norton creep law, material parameters such as creep stress coefficient and stress exponent are considered. In addition, the sensitivity analysis included the uncertainties related to the uniaxial creep rupture data. As might be expected, the results suggest that the predicted creep life is most sensitive to the creep stress. Finally, the present research reveals that the proposed model is simple, practical and can be used in conjunction with any commercial finite element code with creep analysis capabilities...|$|E
