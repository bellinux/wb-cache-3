5|$|Arikamedu, {{the ancient}} {{port city of}} the Cholas, and Urayur and Puhar, their early capitals, have yielded several fragmentary <b>pottery</b> inscriptions, all dated to the Sangam age. Kodumanal, a major {{industrial}} center known for the manufacture of gems during this period, had remains of <b>pottery</b> with inscriptions in Tamil, Prakrit and Sinhala-Prakrit. Alagankulam, a thriving sea port of the early Pandyas, has yielded <b>pottery</b> inscriptions that mention several personal names including {{the name of a}} Chera prince. One of the <b>pottery</b> sherds contained the depiction of a large Roman ship. Many other ancient sites such as Kanchipuram, Karur, Korkai and Puhar have all yielded <b>pottery</b> with inscriptions on them. Outside of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, inscriptions in Tamil-Brahmi have been found in Srikakulam district in Andhra Pradesh, Jaffna in modern Sri Lanka, ancient Roman ports of Qusier al-Qadim and Berenike in Egypt. The 2nd century BCE potsherds found in excavations in Poonagari, Jaffna, bear Tamil inscriptions of a clan name – vēḷāṉ, related to velirs of the ancient Tamil country. The inscriptions at Berenike refer to a Tamil chieftain Korran.|$|E
5|$|Burzahom's ceramic {{industry}} was mostly of hunting based culture and {{is different from}} the Chinese Neolithic <b>pottery.</b> The economy of the people was found to be based on hunting and gathering with a nascent stage of cultivation practices. <b>Pottery</b> made in Burzahom showed close affinity to those found in the Swat valley in Pakistan, particularly in respect of its shapes and decorations of the black ware <b>pottery.</b> The burial practices and type of tools recovered from the site were inferred as having close resemblance to those found in the North Chinese Neolithic culture.|$|E
5|$|Decorative {{arts for}} luxury {{consumers}} included fine <b>pottery,</b> silver and bronze vessels and implements, and glassware. The manufacture of <b>pottery</b> {{in a wide}} range of quality was important to trade and employment, as were the glass and metalworking industries. Imports stimulated new regional centres of production. Southern Gaul became a leading producer of the finer red-gloss <b>pottery</b> (terra sigillata) that was a major item of trade in 1st-century Europe. Glassblowing was regarded by the Romans as originating in Syria in the 1st century BC, and by the 3rd century Egypt and the Rhineland had become noted for fine glass.|$|E

40|$|The Jomon and Yayoi <b>potteries</b> {{generally}} {{show the}} drying shrinkage at about 200 ゜C and the firing shrinkage at about 650 ゜C {{in the measurement}} of the thermal expansion. The firing shrinkage of the Sueki <b>potteries</b> takes place between 900 ゜C and 1000 ゜C. The temperature of the firing shrinkage suggests the upper limit of the temperature which were mainly kept during the burning of <b>potteries.</b> The Jomon and Yayoi <b>potteries</b> are similar in the chemical and mineralogical components and the temperature of burning.

50|$|Because the {{coalfield}} {{developed in}} isolation from the <b>Potteries</b> coalfield, the seam names {{are different from those}} in use in the <b>Potteries.</b> However, as stated earlier, the seams were correlated together in the 1950s by the analysis of marine bands.

5|$|Japanese <b>pottery</b> {{is one of}} the country's oldest {{art forms}} dating to the neolithic period, and some of the world's oldest {{earthenware}} from about 14,000BC has been discovered in Japan. Early <b>pottery</b> objects were made of clay, unglazed and without ornamentation. Later, during the Jōmon, Yayoi and Kofun periods, simple patterned designs and molded ornamentations were added. Such early techniques were formed by coiling or scratching and firing pieces at low temperatures. High-fired Korean Sue ware, and with it the <b>pottery</b> wheel, arrived in Japan around the 6th century, marking the beginning of major technological advances imported from the mainland. Stoneware originated in Japan with the development of green-glazed and other color glazed <b>pottery</b> {{in the second half of}} the 7th century. The oldest item in this list is a green-glazed funerary pot from the 12th century.|$|E

5|$|The black-on-white painted <b>pottery</b> {{found at}} Chaco Canyon {{originated}} from various places throughout the Four Corners region, including the Red Mesa Valley, northeastern Arizona, the San Juan River, and the Chuska Valley, forty miles distant.

5|$|The {{road through}} Gateshead Fell was turnpiked by the Durham to Tyne Bridge Road Act in 1747. Although it had brought some early {{settlers}} to the area, {{the development of}} industry allowed the formative settlement to grow. In 1740, John Warburton opened a <b>pottery</b> at Carr Hill which is credited with introducing white earthenware to Tyneside. Encouraged by Warburton's success, Paul Jackson established the Sheriff Hill <b>Pottery</b> in 1771 at {{the northern end of}} the turnpike road and by 1775 was advertising his earthenware in the Newcastle Journal. Jackson's <b>pottery,</b> which became a local centre of <b>pottery</b> production, attracted settlers to the area and became a source of pride to local residents.|$|E
