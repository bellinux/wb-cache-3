25|$|Malfatti's studies {{began in}} Mackenzie College in São Paulo, but the limited world {{of art in}} Brazil {{was not enough to}} satiate her curious mind and so she left for Berlin in 1912. Europe still {{remained}} an extremely important agent in defining artistic tendencies during this era. Hence, when Anita Malfatti went to Germany and studied with important artists Fritz Burger-Muhlfeld (1867–1927), Lovis Corinth (1858–1925) and Ernst Bischoff-Culm her influences and creative exposure were inflated. During this period she studied German Expressionism. German Expressionism emphasized the color <b>pallette</b> and artists were expected to paint with expressive amounts of emotion that was emphasized and where subjects of the work were frequently altered or jarred. A huge influence in her artistic style lay in her exposure to the Armory Show in Cologne from May to September 1912. At the show a conglomeration of artists were exposed. Although there were many post-impressionist painters exhibited, Cubism stole the show by far. Homer Boss was included in the show and Malfatti went to study with him in New York in 1915. Malfatti also studied under artists George Bridgman, Dimitri Romanoffsky (s.d.-1971), however it was her experience with Homer Boss at the Independent School of Art that was most influential. Homer Boss was a huge impact on Malfatti's style because of his comprehensive studies of the human anatomy. He stressed the idea of understanding the muscular body which helped Malfatti to hone her own technique. New York was central in celebrating Cubism and Malfatti was an exceptional student within the Independent School of Art. Thus she was exposed to European style, which by the early twentieth centuries was even being forged with other styles. Europe's views on Modernism included a subjective treatment toward subjects as well as a highly repellent attitude towards the artistic movements proceeding modernism such as Realism or Romanticism. Malfatti’s exposure to the European world of art allowed her a glimpse into an artistic world that she could never have known in São Paulo and gave her the more global viewpoint that she would pass on to other artists as well.|$|E
500|$|Lark {{was praised}} for being equally good at {{depicting}} violence and introspection, and Martin {{said it was}} Lark's finest work. According to Lark, the characters in Lazarus rarely say what they mean, and some vital story beats are depicted by wordless art. Lark's ability to convey Rucka's story without supporting text led Henry Chamberlain, a reviewer for Comics Grinder, to say [...] "you can feel the chemistry" [...] between them. Arcas received notice for adding texture and depth to Lark's art and using <b>pallette</b> changes to help tell the story.|$|E

50|$|After {{gaining a}} {{life-threatening}} amount of weight, {{he became one}} of the screen's most recognizable character actors. In 1927, he signed as a regular for Hal Roach Studios and was a reliable comic foil in several early Laurel and Hardy movies. In later years, <b>Pallette's</b> weight may have topped out at more than 300 pounds (136 kg).|$|R
5000|$|Sega scaled {{down and}} adapted their Sega System 16 (used to power arcade hits like Altered Beast and Shinobi) into the Mega Drive (sold as the Genesis in North America) and {{released}} {{it with a}} near arcade-perfect port of Altered Beast. Sega's console met lukewarm sales in Japan, but skyrocketed to first place in PAL markets, and made major inroads in North America. Propelled by its effective [...] "Genesis does what Nintendon't" [...] marketing campaign, Sega capitalized on the Genesis's technological superiority over the NES, faithful ports of popular arcade games, and competitive pricing. The arcade gaming company SNK developed the high end Neo Geo MVS arcade system which used interchangeable cartridges similar to home consoles. Building {{on the success of}} the MVS, SNK repackaged the NeoGeo as the Neo Geo AES home console. Though technologically superior to the other fourth-generation consoles, the AES and its games were prohibitively expensive, which kept sales low and prevented it from expanding outside its niche market and into serious competition with Nintendo and Sega. The AES did, however, amass a dedicated cult following, allowing it to see new releases into the 2000s. Fourth generation graphics chips allowed these consoles to reproduce the art styles that were becoming popular in arcades and on home computers. These games often featured lavish background scenery, huge characters, broader color <b>pallettes,</b> and increased emphasis on dithering and texture. Games written specifically for the NES, like Megaman, Shatterhand, and Super Mario Bros. 3 were able to work cleverly within its limitations. Ports of the increasingly detailed arcade and home computer games came up with various solutions. For example, when Capcom released Strider in the arcade they created an entirely separate Strider game for the NES that only incorporated themes and characters from the arcade.|$|R
2500|$|Canoe trips {{launched}} {{from the base}} utilized hundreds of different lakes and rivers and about 300 campsites. About half of these sites were on public lands; the others were on private lands under special arrangements, which typically included maintenance work by the Scouts. Examples of closer frequently used waterways include White Sand, Lost Canoe, <b>Pallette,</b> Escanaba, Presque Isle, Crab, Trout, Boulder, and Wild Rice lakes and the Manitowish and Trout Rivers.

60|$|Such {{were now}} the {{remaining}} two children of old Mr. Dosett,--Lady Tringle, namely, and Reginald Dosett, the clerk in the Admiralty. Adelaide, the beauty {{in chief of the}} family, was gone; and now also her husband, the improvident artist, had followed his wife. Dormer had been by no means a failing artist. He had achieved great honour,--had at an early age been accepted into the Royal Academy,--had sold pictures to illustrious princes and more illustrious dealers, had been engraved and had lived to see his own works resold at five times their original prices. Egbert Dormer might also have been a rich man. But he had a taste for other beautiful things besides a wife. The sweetest little phaeton that was to cost nothing, the most perfect bijou of a little house at South Kensington,--he had boasted that it might have been packed without trouble in his brother-in-law Tringle's dining-room,--the simplest little gem for his wife, just a blue set of china for his dinner table, just a painted cornice for his studio, just satin hangings for his drawing-room,--and a few simple ornaments for his little girls; these with a few rings for himself, and velvet suits of clothing in which to do his painting; these, with a few little dinner parties to show off his blue china, were the first and last of his extravagances. But when he went, and when his pretty things were sold, there was not enough to cover his debts. There was, however, a sweet savour about his name. When he died it was said of him that his wife's death had killed him. He had dropped his <b>pallette,</b> refused to finish the ordered portrait of a princess, and had simply turned himself round and died.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pallette</b> {{was cast}} {{as the father of}} lead actress Jeanne Crain in Army Wives (released in 1944 as In the Meantime, Darling). Director Otto Preminger clashed with <b>Pallette</b> and claimed he was [...] "an admirer of Hitler and {{convinced}} that Germany would win the war". <b>Pallette</b> also refused to sit down at the same table with black actor Clarence Muse in a scene set in a kitchen. [...] "You're out of your mind, I won't sit next to a nigger", <b>Pallette</b> hissed at Preminger. Preminger furiously informed Fox studio head Darryl F. Zanuck, who fired <b>Pallette.</b> Although <b>Pallette</b> remains in scenes he already had filmed, the remainder of his role not yet shot was eliminated from the script.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pallette</b> could anchor a scene just {{by walking}} downstairs. When he enters Preston Sturges's The Lady Eve (1941), {{trotting}} down to breakfast singing a merry ballad, he embodies all the small human hopes that screwball comedy exists to shatter.... The mature <b>Pallette</b> {{character is a}} creature of provocative contradictions—tough-minded but indulgent, earthy but epicurean, relaxed but excitable. His grit and gravel voice sounds simultaneously tough and comic. Even his corpulence is two-sided. In his best films <b>Pallette</b> made his fatness seem like a sign of moderation and common sense. As Friar Tuck in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) or Fray Felipe in The Mark of Zorro (1940), he shows that a fat priest is no heartless zealot but understands {{the sins of the}} flesh. Playing a tubby millionaire like the beer baron in The Lady Eve or Alexander Bullock in My Man Godfrey (1936), <b>Pallette</b> uses his girth to create a common touch. Stuffed into a tuxedo that seems perpetually near bursting, he seems more down-to-earth than the stylish high society types who surround him. Even Pallette's villains, like the corrupt and cynical politico Chick McCann in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, are immensely likeable. Pushed too far, <b>Pallette</b> confidently uses his weight for physical force. When Bullock finally evicts the free-loading Carlo (Mischa Auer) in My Man Godfrey, we are not so much surprised as reassured by Pallette's manly strength. In battle his sword-wielding Friar Tuck is a glory to behold. <b>Pallette</b> may have gained weight, but he never lost his underlying virility.|$|E
