500|$|Along with {{introducing}} the band's new sound, the song opens the album as {{a statement of}} intent. Lyrically, new anticipations and appetites are suggested ("I'm ready for what's next"), as is a willingness to throw caution to the wind and take risks ("I'm ready {{to let go of}} the steering wheel"). Some of the lyrics, particularly those in the bridge before the final chorus, use the eponymous subway station as a metaphor for time: [...] "Time is a train / Makes the future the past / Leaves you standing in the station / Your face <b>pressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the glass". Bono cites the enjoyment of his first child born in 1989 as a major influence on Achtung Baby, as was his wife's second pregnancy during the album's 1991 recording. Bono says babies influenced the lines from the first verse, [...] "I'm ready to say I'm glad to be alive / I'm ready, I'm ready for the push".|$|E

In {{the course of the}} morning, the {{officers}} on board both schooners, profiting by lulls and clear moments, had got so many views of the land from aloft, as to be fully aware of their respective situations. All thoughts of competition and watchfulness had now vanished. Each vessel was managed with a reference solely to her safety; and, as might have been foreseen when true seamen handled both, they had recourse to the same expedients to save themselves. The mainsails of both crafts were set, balance-reefed, and the hulls were <b>pressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the wind and sea, while they were driven ahead with increased momentum.|$|E

60|$|There also in {{the narrow}} court was a fight going on--but nearly ended. Geordie Douglas knelt over the {{prostrate}} form of Rudiger von Balchenburg, calling on him to yield, but meeting no answer. One or two other men lay overthrown, three or four more were <b>pressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> a wall, howling for mercy. Sigismund was shouting to them in German--Ringan and the other assailants standing guard over them; but evidently hardly withheld from slaughtering them.

60|$|The mate {{instantly}} {{sounded the}} well-known cry, which summoned the watch below to {{the assistance of}} their shipmates on the deck. Little delay occurred, and not a word was uttered, but the short, authoritative mandates which Wilder saw fit to deliver from his own lips. No longer <b>pressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the wind, the ship, obedient to her helm, gracefully began to incline her head from the waves, and to bring the wind abeam. Then, instead of breasting and mounting the endless hillocks, like a being that toiled heavily along its path, she fell into the trough of the sea, from which she issued like a courser, who, have conquered an ascent, shoots along the track with redoubled velocity. For an instant the wind appear ed to have lulled, though the wide ridge of foam which rolled along on each side the vessel's bows, sufficiently proclaimed that she was skimming lightly before it. In another moment, the tall spars began to incline again to the west, and the vessel came swooping up to the wind, until her plunges and shocks against the seas were renewed as violently as before. When every yard and sheet were properly trimmed to meet the new position of the vessel, Wilder turned anxiously {{to get a glimpse}} of the stranger. A minute was lost in ascertaining the precise spot where he ought to appear; for, in such a chaos of water, and with no guide but the judgment, the eye was apt to deceive itself, by referring to the nearer and more familiar objects by which the spectator was surrounded.|$|E

50|$|Several {{methods can}} be used to shore up a trench. Hydraulic shoring is the use of {{hydraulic}} pistons that can be pumped outward until they <b>press</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the trench walls. They are typically combined with steel plate or a special heavy plywood called Finform. Another method is called beam and plate, in which steel I-beams are driven into the ground and steel plates are slid in amongst them. A similar method that uses wood planks is called soldier boarding. Hydraulics tend to be faster and easier; the other methods tend to be used for longer term applications or larger excavations.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{considers}} how {{written language}} frames visual objects. Drawing on Michel Foucault’s response to Raymond Roussel’s obsessive description, the essay proposes {{a model of}} criticism where description might <b>press</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> its objects. This critical closeness is then mapped across the conceptual art practice and art criticism of Ian Burn. Burn attends to the differences between seeing and reading, and considers the conditions which frame how we look at images, including how we look at, and through words. The essay goes on to consider Meaghan Morris’s writing on Lynn Silverman’s photographs. Both Morris and Burn offer an alternative to a parasitic model of criticism and enact a patient way of looking across and through visual landscapes. </span...|$|R

Treefalls are a favored site, as are debris piles, burrows (especially those of the armadillo (Dasypodidae family) and agouti (Dasyprocta species)), hollow logs, holes, and heavy vegetation cover. They generally try to find tight-fitting resting places, and will occasionally 'wedge' themselves between roots and trunks but remain otherwise exposed. Burrows and holes are often flooded and the tortoises will rest {{in the water and}} mud with just their nostrils and eyes exposed. In warmer weather, they <b>press</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> moister, cooler surfaces in shelter areas.

50|$|SQRTM is an RTM process {{adapted to}} prepreg technology. The prepreg {{is placed in}} a closed mold and during the cure cycle, {{a small amount of}} resin is {{injected}} into the cavity through ports positioned around the part. This resin does not go into the laminate, but only <b>presses</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the edge of the laminate in order to establish hydrostatic pressure on the prepreg, similar to the goal of autoclave curing. This pressure is similar to the autoclave, on the order of 6-7 bars (90-100 psi). Hydrostatic pressure minimizes voids by keeping dissolved air, water and resin monomers in solution in the resin.The tool can either be self-clamped and self-heated or heated and clamped by a press. The equipment is composed of a tool, a press, an injector, and a vacuum pump.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} skid-steer loader {{arms were}} designed using a hinge {{at the rear}} of the machine to pivot the loader arm up into the air in an arc that swings up over the top of the operator. This design tends to limit the usable height to how long the loader arm is and the height of that pivot point. In the raised position the front of the loader arm moves towards the rear of the machine, requiring the operator to move extremely close to or <b>press</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the side of a tall container or other transport vehicle to get the bucket close enough to dump accurately. At the highest arm positions the bucket may overflow the rear of the bucket and spill directly onto the top of the machine's cab.|$|R

50|$|This {{grass is}} a clump-forming {{perennial}} growing from a rhizome. It produces erect stems up to a meter tall, or occasionally taller. Previous seasons' dry stems and leaves {{remain in the}} clump, and the clump sometimes makes a ring shape. The clumps can be 2 meters wide. The species is dioecious, with male and female parts on separate plants. The inflorescence is a narrow panicle with branches <b>pressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the stem. The flowers lack awns.

A fire alarm went off in the watch room of the castle fire brigade, manned by the Chief Fire Officer, Marshall Smith. The location of the fire was shown by a light on a grid-map of the castle. Initially, the Brunswick Tower was lit up, but lights soon began to flash indicating that the fire had quickly spread to neighbouring rooms.|$|E
50|$|A trainer {{consists}} of a frame, a clamp to hold the bicycle securely, a roller that <b>presses</b> <b>up</b> <b>against</b> the rear wheel, and a mechanism that provides resistance when the pedals are turned. In a wind trainer, the roller drives fan blades that create air resistance. These are typically the least expensive and noisiest trainers. Magnetic trainers have magnets and a conducting flywheel operating as an eddy current brake. They are moderately expensive and moderately noisy. Some magnetic trainers have handlebar-mounted control boxes to change the level of resistance during a training session. Fluid trainers use liquid-filled chambers to create resistance. They are the most expensive and quietest trainers. A small number of trainers use a centrifugal pressure mechanism to create resistance, involving pressure plates, ball bearings and specially shaped grooves. These are similar to fluid trainers in price and performance.|$|R
