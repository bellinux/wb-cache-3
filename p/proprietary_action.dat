There are two accounts that try to resolve this puzzle of synchronic self-control, Jeanette Kennett and Michael Smith’s ‘non-actional ’ account and Alfred Mele’s ‘ancillary action ’ account. I crit-icize these accounts because they set too strong constraints on what kinds of synchronic self-control are possible, and thus what willpower could turn out to be.

5000|$|The {{development}} of the double rifle has always followed the {{development of}} the double-barrelled shotgun, the two are generally very similar but the stresses of firing a solid projectile are far greater than shot. The first double-barrelled muskets were created in the 1830s when deer stalking became popular in Scotland. Previously single barrelled weapons had been used but, recognising the need for a rapid second shot to dispatch a wounded animal, double-barrelled muskets were built along the same format as double-barrelled shotguns already in common use. These first double-barrelled weapons were black powder, smoothbore muzzleloaders built with either flintlock or percussion cap ignition systems. Whilst true rifling dates from the mid 16th century, the invention of the express rifle by James Purdey [...] "the Younger" [...] in 1856 allowed for far greater muzzle velocities to be achieved through a rifled longarm, significantly improving the trajectory and as such greatly improving the range of these rifles. [...] These express rifles had two deep opposing grooves which were wide and deep enough to prevent the lead bullets from stripping the rifling if fired at high velocities, a significant problem previously. These muzzle loading rifles came in a large variety of calibres, the most common calibres for medium thin skinned plains and deer sized game were [...]400 in, [...]450 in, [...]500 in, [...]577 in and 12 bore (18.5 mm or [...]729 in). For larger thick skinned type game 10 bore (19.7 mm or [...]775 in), 8 bore (21.2 mm or [...]835 in) and 4 bore (26.7 mm or 1.05 in) were used, the last being a specialist elephant hunting calibre. Whilst most of these calibres could be purchased with rifling, the giant 4 bore and the less common 6 bore were rarely rifled, as the increased friction from the rifling caused excessive recoil. Various experimental breech loaders had been in existence since the 16th century, however developments such as the Ferguson rifle in the 1770s and early pinfire cartridges in the 1830s had little impact on sporting rifles due to their experimental nature, expense and the extraordinary strength and reliability of the percussion muzzleloader. [...] In 1858, Westley Richards patented the break open, top leaver breech loading action, whilst a useful development these early break open designs {{had a great deal of}} elasticity in the action and upon firing they sprung open slightly, a problem that gradually worsened with repeated firing and with more powerful cartridges. Many gunmakers tried various methods to rectify this problem, all to little avail until Westley Richards invented the [...] "Dolls head" [...] lock in 1862 which greatly improved rigidity, this was followed by James Purdey's under-locking mechanism in 1863 and W.W. Greener's [...] "Wedge fast" [...] system in 1873, finally the basic break open action known to this day had the strength required to meet the stresses of large-bore projectiles. By 1914, triple, quadruple and even quintuple locking designs could be found in various <b>proprietary</b> <b>actions.</b> In 1861 the centrefire rifle cartridge was invented, and quickly a large number of blackpowder centrefire cartridges were developed in the same calibres as their muzzle loading forebears, [...] including the [...]450/400 Black Powder Express, the extremely popular [...]450 Black Powder Express, the [...]500 Black Powder Express and the [...]577 Black Powder Express, all with various case lengths. The first brass 10 bore, 8 bore and 4 bore cartridges were not developed until 1870, their arrival spelling the end of the muzzle loading era. Until this time all double rifles had external hammers whose fall struck the mechanism which fired the cartridge, however attempts to remove them were well under way. The first [...] "hammerless" [...] action of significance was invented by Thomas Murcott in 1871, known as [...] "The Mousetrap", it was a complex design but it sold in significant numbers. In 1875, Westley Richards employees William Anson and John Deeley patented the [...] "Anson & Deeley" [...] hammerless boxlock action, and in 1878 the Birmingham gunmakers W&C Scott & Son invented the basic sidelock action which was so successful it was immediately adopted by Holland & Holland. By 1900 the boxlock and sidelock hammerless actions had largely superseded the hammer rifles and, with the addition of ejectors and assisted opening, the basic design of the double rifle has changed little to this day. Interestingly, it was Westley Richards who invented the first reliable safety catch for doubles, ejectors, the single selective trigger and the special extractors that enabled rimless cartridges to be used in double rifles, all features found in modern double rifles. In 1898, John Rigby & Company loaded the [...]450 Black Powder Express with smokeless cordite creating the [...]450 Nitro Express, the first Nitro Express cartridge, this was to have a profound impact on sporting cartridge development and the double rifle was to become synonymous with the Nitro Express cartridges. Now in its final form and chambering modern Nitro Express cartridges, the British double rifle entered its golden age at the turn of 20th century and it was to last for the next three decades, with the birth of the White hunter and professional hunting safari industry in East Africa.|$|R

5000|$| which Stable J. referred) in Palmer v Temple {{between a}} deposit {{which was to}} be {{forfeited}} if the plaintiff should not perform the contract and a mere part payment the right to which depended upon performance of the contract. The statement also accords with the point made by Dixon J. in McDonald v Dennys Lascelles Ltd, where he said:"When a contract stipulates for payment of part of the purchase money in advance, the purchaser relying only on the vendor's promise to give him a conveyance, the vendor is entitled to enforce payment before the time has arrived for conveying the land; yet his title to retain the money has been considered not to be absolute but conditional upon the subsequent completion of the contract."16. The question whether an advance payment, not being a deposit or earnest of performance, is absolute or conditional is one of construction. In determining that question it is material to ascertain whether the payee is required by the contract to perform work and incur expense before completing this performance of his or her obligations under the contract. If the payee is so required then, unless the contract manifests a contrary intention, it would be unreasonable to hold that the payee's right to retain the payment is conditional upon performance of the contractual obligations.17. I {{have come to the conclusion}} in the present case that the respondent is not entitled to recover the cruise fare on either of the grounds just discussed. The consequence of the respondent's enjoyment of the benefits provided under the contract during the first eight full days of the cruise is that the failure of consideration was partial, not total. I do not understand how, viewed from the perspective of failure of consideration, the enjoyment of those benefits was [...] "entirely negated by the catastrophe which occurred upon departure from Picton", to repeat the words of the primary judge.18. Nor is there any acceptable foundation for holding that the advance payment of the cruise fare created in the appellant no more than a right to retain the payment conditional upon its complete performance of its entire obligations under the contract. As the contract called for performance by the appellant of its contractual obligations from the very commencement of the voyage and continuously thereafter, the advance payment should be regarded as the provision of consideration for each and every substantial benefit expected under the contract. It would not be reasonable to treat the appellant's right to retain the fare as conditional upon complete performance when the appellant is under a liability to provide substantial benefits to the respondent during the course of the voyage. After all, the return of the respondent to Sydney at the end of the voyage, though an important element in the performance of the appellant's obligations, was but one of many elements.In order to illustrate the magnitude of the step which the respondent asks the Court to take, it is sufficient to pose two questions, putting to one side cl.9 of the printed ticket terms and conditions. Would the respondent be entitled to a return of the fare if, owing to failure of the ship's engines, the ship was unable to proceed on the last leg of the cruise to Sydney and it became necessary to airlift the respondent to Sydney? Would the fare be recoverable if, owing to a hurricane, the ship was compelled to omit a visit to one of the scheduled ports of call? The answer in each case must be a resounding negative.19. The respondent sought to derive support from authorities relating to the contracts for the carriage of goods by sea which hold that freight is due on the arrival of the goods at the agreed destination. More to the point is the principle that an advance by the shipper on account of the freight to be earned is, in the absence of any stipulation to the contrary, [...] "an irrevocable payment at the risk of the shipper of the goods". The result of this rule is that an advance on account of freight may be retained, notwithstanding that, because of a failure to complete the voyage and to deliver the goods, the freight remains unearned and that a payment due as an advance on account of freight is recoverable (if not duly paid) even after frustration of the voyage.This does not mean that freight is earned prior to delivery: it will be earned upon shipment only if the parties expressly so stipulate). This rule, although it has been said to be a stipulation introduced into such contracts by custom and not the result of applying some abstract principle, would certainly exclude a restitutionary claim on facts analogous to those in the present case.The combination of a claim for restitution and a claim for damages20. In view of my conclusion that the respondent cannot succeed in her restitutionary claim for recoupment of the fare, there is no necessity for me to consider whether the two claims can be maintained. However, as the question has been argued, I should record my view of the question. There is authority to suggest that the claims are alternative and not cumulative. But Lord Denning MR was clearly of the view that the claims may be concurrent. In Heywood v Wellers, he said:"(The plaintiff) could recover the 175 pounds as money paid on a consideration which had wholly failed. She was, therefore, entitled to recover it as of right. And she is entitled to recover as well damages for negligence. Take this instance. If you engage a driver to take you to the station to catch a train for a day trip to the sea, you pay him 2 pounds - and then the car breaks down owing to his negligence. So that you miss your holiday. In that case you can recover not only your 2 pounds back but also damages for the disappointment, upset and mental distress which you suffered".Lord Denning was speaking of negligence in the sense of breach of a contractual obligation of due care. He noted a qualification to the entitlement to maintain the two claims:"Some reduction should be made for the fact that if the (defendants) had done their duty... it would have cost her something."That reduction was accordingly made to the damages for breach of contract.21. Similarly, in Millar's Machinery Company Limited v David Way and Son, the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from a decision of Branson J. in which such a dual award was made. The case concerned a contract for supply of machinery. It was held that there had been a total failure of consideration and that the purchasers were entitled to recover the amount paid on account. In addition, the purchasers were held to be entitled to damages, the proper measure of which was:"the sum which the (purchasers) had to spend to put themselves in the position which they would have been if the (suppliers) had carried out their contract".That amount was the difference between the contract price and the amount which they had to pay to another supplier for a similar machine.22. And Treitel says in relation to claims for loss of bargain, reliance loss and restitution:"There is sometimes said to be an inconsistency between combining the various types of claim... The true principle is not that there is any logical objection to combining the various types of claim, but that the plaintiff cannot combine them so as to recover more than once for the same loss ... The point has been well put by Corbin: 'full damages and complete restitution ... will not both be given for the same breach of contract'."23. The action to recover money paid on a total failure of consideration is on a common money count for money had and received to the use of the plaintiff. To the extent that it is necessary to say so, this decision correctly reflects the law in Australia and, to the extent that it is inconsistent, should be preferred to the decision of this Court in In re Continental C. and G. Rubber Co. <b>Proprietary</b> Ltd.. The <b>action</b> evolved from the writ of indebitatus assumpsit. It is available only if the contract has been discharged, either for breach or following frustration, and if there has been a total, and not merely partial, failure of consideration. It is now clear that, in these cases, the discharge operates only prospectively, that is, it is not equivalent to rescission ab initio [...] Nor is rescission ab initio a precondition for recovery. Unconditionally accrued rights, including accrued rights to sue for damages for prior breach of the contract, are not affected by the discharge. Prepayments can, in general, be recovered, but the position of deposits or earnests is not entirely clear, the better view being that they are not recoverable if paid to provide a sanction against withdrawal.24. In 1846, when Pollock CB held in Walstab v Spottiswoode that it was not possible to combine a claim for damages with one for restitution, the restitutionary action was brought on the writ of indebitatus assumpsit, was essentially a procedural development, simplifying recovery and providing a more convenient or more summary remedy). Subsequently, Lord Wright said in Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd:"The writ of indebitatus assumpsit involved at least two averments, the debt or obligation and the assumpsit [...] The former was the basis of the claim and was the real cause of action. The latter was merely fictitious and could not be traversed, but was necessary to enable the convenient and liberal form of action to be used in such cases."The action was, as Lord Mansfield said in Moses v Macferlan, [...] "quasi ex contractu" [...] and founded on an obligation imposed by law and accommodated within the system of formal pleading by means of the fictitious assumpsit or promise. It was necessary to plead the fictitious assumpsit until the enactment of s.3 of the Common Law Procedure Act 1852 (Eng.). And even then its influence continued.The abolition of the forms of action inspired an analysis of the sources of obligation in the common law in terms of a rigid dichotomy|$|R
