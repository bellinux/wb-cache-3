Comparisons were made of vertical crustal movements as revealed by precise relevelings with the deformation of river terraces and the underlying Neogene and Quaternary <b>fold</b> <b>structures.</b> They found that both deformed terraces and vertical displacement of bench marks were concordant to underlying <b>fold</b> <b>structures.</b> This is interpreted as showing that some of the <b>folding</b> <b>structures</b> indicated by Neogene and Quaternary strata are still active...|$|R
40|$|<b>Folded</b> <b>structures</b> are {{three-dimensional}} structures - spatial {{structures and}} {{they belong to}} the structural systems. The term <b>folded</b> <b>structure</b> defines a <b>folded</b> form of construction, including structures derived from elements which form a <b>folded</b> <b>structure</b> by their mutual relationship in space. For very long time this type of construction has been realized in practice only in of reinforced concrete and made on site, which conditioned {{the use of a}} very complicated shell. Development of prefabricated building led to improvements of this type of construction so that the <b>folded</b> <b>structures</b> could be derived by assembly of prefabricated elements and their relationship - monolithization on site. Development of the research of <b>folded</b> <b>structures,</b> starting from their earliest days to today, followed the innovations and latest developments in terms of applied materials and methods of connection. The tendency for the cost effective and quicker construction pushed the <b>folded</b> <b>structures</b> made in reinforced concrete, and led to the construction realized in wood, steel and other modern materials that eventually experienced expansion...|$|R
40|$|Protein-based hydrogels {{usually do}} not exhibit high {{stretchability}} or toughness, significantly limiting the scope of their potential biomedical applications. Here we report the engineering of a chemically crosslinked, highly elastic and tough protein hydrogel using a mechanically extremely labile, de novo designed protein that assumes the classical ferredoxin-like <b>fold</b> <b>structure.</b> Due to the low mechanical stability of the ferredoxin-like <b>fold</b> <b>structure,</b> swelling of hydrogels causes a significant fraction of the <b>fold</b> <b>structure</b> domains to unfold. Subsequent collapse and aggregation of unfolded ferredoxin-like <b>fold</b> <b>structure</b> domains leads to intertwining of physically and chemically crosslinked networks, entailing hydrogels with unusual physical and mechanical properties: a negative swelling ratio, high stretchability and toughness. These hydrogels can withstand an average strain of 450 % before breaking and show massive energy dissipation. Upon relaxation, refolding of the ferredoxin-like <b>fold</b> <b>structure</b> domains enables the hydrogel to recover its massive hysteresis. This novel biomaterial may expand the scope of hydrogel applications in tissue engineering...|$|R
40|$|Co-assemble diverse {{functional}} nanomaterials with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to form <b>folded</b> <b>structured</b> SWCNT hybrid {{papers are}} potentially desirable for the applications in flexible conductors and phase change materials, {{due to the}} combination of <b>folded</b> porous <b>structure</b> and the synergistic effects between SWCNTs and nanomaterials. Herein, we report a scalable strategy to fabricate multifunctional <b>folded</b> <b>structured</b> SWCNT hybrid papers via processes of freeze drying-mechanically pressing technique. These characteristics featuring high porosity, flexibility and interconnection enable the compartmental films to be bent, resulting in <b>folded</b> <b>structure.</b> To investigate their properties and applications, the specific folded paper based on SWCNTs, Ag nanoparticles and alginate is developed. The <b>folded</b> <b>structure</b> enables the conductors to possess excellent mechanical performance and resistance-strain stability under various deformations. Moreover, the folded porous paper is also employed as temperature-driven switch {{to be capable of}} tuning the contact angle of water with superior reversibility by thermally activating the transition between air/liquid(1) /liquid(2) /solid system and air/liquid/solid system via the thermo-responsive phase change of paraffin, indicating an important branch of liquid transfer. We have a great expectation that the assembly proposed can afford a universal route to prepare other <b>folded</b> <b>structured</b> hybrid papers based on various functional nanoparticles, nanotubes and nanosheets.

(The oxidized coenzymes appear to exist in the same <b>folded</b> <b>structure.)</b> Furthermore, the ribose protons undergo very little conformational change upon reduction of the pyridine ring; this observation strongly suggests a considerable similarity between the folded forms of the oxidized and reduced coenzymes.

40|$|Abstract. As {{an example}} of the {{categorical}} apparatus employed to give a rigorous definition of conformal field theory, we show that pseudo algebras over the 2 -theory of categories can be viewed as pseudo double categories with <b>folding</b> <b>structures</b> or as appropriate 2 -functors into bicategories. <b>Folding</b> <b>structures</b> are equivalent to connection pairs, and also to thin structures if the vertical and horizontal morphisms coincide. In a sense, the squares of a double category with <b>folding</b> <b>structure</b> are determined in a functorial way by the 2 -cells of the horizontal 2 -category. As a special case, strict 2 -algebras with one object and everything invertible are crossed modules with a group action. All of the necessary double categorical concepts are introduced along with examples, which include Riemann surfaces with boundary and bimodules over rings...|$|R
40|$|Folding as {{a subject}} of mathematical, computational, and {{engineering}} study is relatively young. Most results in this field are hard to apply in engineering practice because the use of physical materials to construct <b>folded</b> <b>structures</b> has not been fully considered nor adequately addressed. I propose a three-fold approach {{to the design of}} <b>folded</b> <b>structures</b> with physical consideration, separating for independent investigation (1),the computational complexity of basic folding paradigms, (2) the automated accommodation of facet material volume, and (3) the design of folded geometry under boundary constraints.

40|$|Complicated <b>folded</b> <b>structures</b> were {{recently}} recorded by radar survey {{in the lower}} portions of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. From a geological point of view the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are considered as geological features, while the ice is classified as sedimentary or metamorphic rock. In this regard {{the genesis of the}} ice sheets is analyzed from the perspective of geodynamics and metamorphism, and complicated <b>folded</b> <b>structures</b> on radar profiles are interpreted as tectonic and metamorphic structures. This study considers the processes of three kinds of tectonic structures: glacial diapirs, glacial diapir folds and glacial intrusions.

40|$|How chaperones {{interact}} with protein chains {{to assist in}} their folding is a central open ques-tion in biology. Obtaining atomistic insight is challenging in particular, given the transient nature of the chaperone-substrate complexes and the large system sizes. Recent single-molecule experiments {{have shown that the}} chaperone Trigger Factor (TF) not only binds unfolded protein chains, but can also guide protein chains to their native state by interacting with partially <b>folded</b> <b>structures.</b> Here, we used all-atom MD simulations to provide atomistic insights into how Trigger Factor achieves this chaperone function. Our results indicate a crucial role for the tips of the finger-like appendages of TF in the early interactions with both unfolded chains and partially <b>folded</b> <b>structures.</b> Unfolded chains are kinetically trapped when bound to TF, which suppresses the formation of transient, non-native end-to-end con-tacts. Mechanical flexibility allows TF to hold partially <b>folded</b> <b>structures</b> with two tips (in a pinching configuration), and to stabilize them by wrapping around its appendages. This encapsulation mechanism is distinct from that of chaperones such as GroEL, and allows <b>folded</b> <b>structures</b> of diverse size and composition to be protected from aggregation and mis...|$|R

However, the distance distribution derived from the ZFD SAXS data indicates that the protein has a larger maximum pairwise distance Dmax and thus can be more extended (Fig.  4 B).
