5000|$|The {{superior}} surface articulates {{with the}} root of the pterygoid process and the under surface of the sphenoidal concha, its medial border reaching as far as the ala of the vomer; it presents a groove which contributes to the formation of the <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|E
50|$|The palatovaginal canal (also <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>canal)</b> is a canal {{between the}} sphenoid bone and the palatine bone {{that connects the}} {{nasopharynx}} with the pterygopalatine fossa. An inconstant vomerovaginal canal may lie between the ala of the vomer and the vaginal process of the sphenoid bone, medial to the palatovaginal canal, and lead into the anterior end of the palatovaginal canal. It transmits the pharyngeal branch of the third part of the maxillary artery.|$|E
40|$|Programmed {{cell death}} is a {{physiological}} process in mammalian development by which specific types of cells are eliminated, and, hence, is of fundamental importance in normal human embryogenesis. A patient is described with multiple congenital anomalies that {{may be explained by}} a disturbance of programmed cell death. Anomalies included macrocephaly, hypoplastic lacrimal ducts, narrow external ear <b>canals,</b> <b>pharyngeal</b> mucous membrane fold, unilateral cryptorchidism, cord-like vasa deferentia, and complete cutaneous syndactyly of the hands and fee...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the usefulness of}} magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for differential diagnosis of intraoral tumor in neonates. We present two neonates who suffered from dyspnea due to intraoral tumor since bith. In both cases, computed tomogra- phy (CT) failed to reveal the communication between the intraoral tumor and intracranial organs. In Case 1, the intraoral tumor communicating with sella turcica through a cranio- <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>canal</b> was identified by MRI and then, a diagnosis of transsphenoidal meningoencephalocele was established. In Case 2, a diagnosis of solitary cyst in the oropharynx was established by MRI. MRI was very useful in the differential diagnosis of intraoral tumor in neonates...|$|E
