40|$|Pre-activation before ground impact {{can play}} an {{important}} roles during drop jumps（ DJ）. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the regulation of triceps surae muscle activation during DJs. Seven healthy subjects dropped from 3 different heights, and were asked to not rebound （landing only: LAND） or rebound with maximal effort （RJmax）. Joint angular data, ground reaction force and electromyography of the lower leg muscles were simultaneously recorded during each DJ. With higher drop heights, agonist muscle activities （medial gastrocnemius and soleus muscles） during the pre-activation phase were dramatically increased, while those did not show any differences during <b>braking</b> <b>phase.</b> The increased agonist muscle activation before touchdown（ pre-activation） was significantly decreased during the following <b>braking</b> <b>phase</b> for regulation of low stiffness in the LAND. The agonist muscle activities during <b>braking</b> <b>phase</b> were increased with stiffness index of muscle-tendon unit from LAND to RJmax during constant drop height. However, the pre-activation of the agonist muscle was not increased while that of the corresponding antagonist tibialis anterior muscle was significantly increased from LAND to RJmax. During the following <b>braking</b> <b>phase,</b> the antagonist muscle activities were not increased. These results suggest that the effects of agonist muscle pre-activation are mainly for the impact of touchdown, and not for the regulation of landing or rebound. Consequently, the antagonist pre-activation and the agonist muscles activation of <b>braking</b> <b>phase</b> may play important roles to control motion after landing, and regulate stiffness...|$|R

It is demonstrated that, in contrast to overground, no mean fore-after force impulse should be generated to follow an accelerating treadmill due to the absence of linear whole body acceleration. Accordingly, the adaptations in the <b>braking</b> <b>phase</b> (less <b>braking)</b> and propulsive <b>phase</b> (more propulsion) to accelerate overground are not present to follow an accelerating treadmill.

40|$|The {{entrainment}} is {{a physical}} phenomenon that concerns the transport of bubbles, droplets and, in general, particles that are spread in a fluid stream. Studies on the entrainment are very important for hybrid rocket engines that use liquefying fuels. These materials form a thin liquid layer. If the liquid film is stressed by aerodynamic forces it becomes unstable and at the liquid-gas interface waves are formed. When the forces acting on the interface are large enough some waves detach from the liquid phase; the liquid structures, in the gas <b>phase,</b> <b>brake</b> up in many droplets. The physical properties of the fuel spray define the heat and mass transfer that occurs in hybrid motors during the combustion processes. “Physical properties” are basically the detach rate of the droplets, their size, and distribution speed.

The entrainment is reproduced, in frozen conditions, in an experimental setup which allows the process recording thanks to a fast-digital-camera.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} how elite volleyball players employed the arm swing (AS) to enhance their jump performance. The study assessed how the AS influenced the duration and magnitude of the vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) during the main <b>phases</b> (preparatory, <b>braking</b> and accelerating) of the countermovement vertical jump (CMVJ), the starting position of the body at the beginning of the accelerating phase and the moment when the AS began contributing to increasing the jump height. Eighteen elite volleyball players performed three CMVJs with and without an AS. Kinetics and kinematics data were collected using two Kistler force plates and the C-motion system. The time and force variables were evaluated based on the VGRF, and the position of the body and the trajectory of the arm movement were determined using kinematic analysis. The AS improved the CMVJ by increasing the jump height by 38 % relative to jumping without an AS. The AS significantly shortened the <b>braking</b> <b>phase</b> and prolonged the accelerating phase, however, it did not influence the preparatory phase or the overall jump duration. The AS also significantly increased the average force during the accelerating phase as well as the accelerating impulse. The AS upward began at 76 % into the overall jump duration.

Their results, due to previous assumptions or limitations in the scope of investigations, rarely provide an overall view of the problem. These attempts are typically made in scientific papers and dissertations [1 - 3].

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the lower extremities biomechanical differences between prepubescent and adult males during drop jumps (DJs). Twenty-four untrained males (12 prepubescents, 12 adults) performed DJs from 20 cm height. Kinematics of the lower extremities were captured, in addition with vertical ground reaction forces (vGRFs) and EMG activity of the gastrocnemius medialis (GM), soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. The results showed that men jumped higher, as expected, but their knees were more flexed prior to landing, and their preactivation level was higher and longer in duration compared to prepubescent boys. During landing, men had shorter contact times, lower vGRF normalized to body mass, and less maximal knee joint flexion. Regarding EMG activity men presented higher stretch reflex and higher EMG activity during the <b>braking</b> <b>phase</b> but the level of coactivation (TA to GM + SOL ratio) was lower. It is seems that pre-landing and landing patterns during a complex task such as DJ are affected by physical development. There are indications that men had higher performance in a DJ than prepubescent boys because they activated more effectively their muscles during the preactivation and <b>braking</b> <b>phase.</b> The above-mentioned data support the hypothesis that prepubescent boys might be inferior in optimal regulation of their muscle-tendon unit stiffness...|$|R

40|$|Brake squeal" groups a large set of high {{frequency}} sound emissions from brake systems, generated during the <b>braking</b> <b>phase</b> and {{characterized by a}} harmonic spectrum. The generation of squeal is due to an unstable behaviour of the system during the <b>braking</b> <b>phase.</b> Many researchers associate the squeal phenomena to the coalescence of two eigenfrequencies of the system: when two modes, characterized by large deformation at the contact surface, couple at the same frequency, one of them becomes unstable leading to increasing vibration. The present experimental analysis is focused on correlating the propensity to instability of a system mode with its modal damping. Because {{of the complexity of}} real brake systems, a simplified experimental set-up is proposed. The set-up is a valid tool that permits to control easily and modify its dynamics. A clear distinction is obtained between the dynamics of the friction pad and the caliper. Different conditions of unstable coupling between a mode of the brake disc and a mode of the caliper or the pad are analyzed. Two opposite roles of the modal damping are detected. A large modal damping can either prevent the rise of squeal instabilities or enlarge the squeal propensity of the brake apparatus. Moreover, the add of damping, aimed to prevent a specified squeal condition, can cause the rise of different squeal events...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{documented}} that increasing effort during exercise is characterized {{by an increase in}} electromyographic activity of the relevant muscles. How aging influences this relationship is a matter of great interest. In the present study, nine young and 24 elderly subjects did repetitive hopping with maximal effort as well as with 50 %, 65 %, 75 % and 90 % intensities. During hopping joint kinematics were measured together with electromyographic activity (EMG) from the soleus, gastrocnemius medialis, gastrocnemius lateralis and tibialis anterior muscles. The results showed that agonist activation increased in both age groups with increasing intensity. The highest jumping efficiency (EMG ratio of the <b>braking</b> <b>phase</b> to the push off–phase activation) was achieved with moderate hopping intensities (65 – 75 %) in both the young and in the elderly. Age-comparison showed that elderly subjects had high agonist preactivation but thereafter lower activation during the <b>braking</b> <b>phase.</b> Antagonist coactivation was minimal and did not show age- or intensity-specificity. The elderly had more flexed knees at the instant of ground contact. When intensity increased, the elderly also plantarflexed their ankles more before ground contact. Ankle joint stiffness was lower in elderly subjects only in high hopping intensities (90 % and Max). These results confirm that age-specific agonist muscle activation profiles exist during hopping even when exercise intensities are matched on the relative scale. The results suggest further that the elderly can adjust their reduced neuromuscular capacity to match the demands set by different exercise intensities...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} parameters characterizing the performance of brake materials is their formulation. Therefore, the precise analysis of brake materials is needed both to investigate formulation-performance relationship, and to maintain quality control. A typical brake composite contains more than ten phases (components), either crystalline or amorphous.

However, the combination of these methods is insufficient for precise resolution of all <b>phases</b> in <b>brake</b> composites. The large number of phases can cause the overlapping of peaks in the XRD pattern, making them difficult to identify. This problem has been overcome by using density gradient centrifugation (DGC) to separate the powdered sample into density fractions that are easier to identify.

Fumigation of DME and propane significantly increased BTE and reduced brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) compared to the baseline diesel con-dition with no fumigation. A mixture of 20 % DME with 30 % propane provided the maxi-mum BTE, with 24 % reduction in BSEC, however, at the expense of increasing peak cylinder pressure by 6 bar, which was even higher at greater DME substitutions. Fumi-gated DME auto-ignited early, ahead of top dead center (TDC), showing the typical low temperature heat release (LTHR) and high temperature heat release (HTHR) events and propane addition suppressed the early LTHR, shifting more of the DME heat release closer to TDC.
