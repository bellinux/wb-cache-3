40|$|Abstract. Can you {{guarantee}} secrecy even if {{an adversary}} can eavesdrop on your brain? We consider {{the problem of}} protecting privacy in circuits, when faced with an adversary that can access a bounded number of wires in the circuit. This question is motivated by side channel attacks, which allow an adversary to gain partial access to {{the inner workings of}} hardware. Recent work has shown that side channel attacks pose a serious threat to cryptosystems implemented in embedded devices. In this paper, we develop theoretical foundations for security against side channels. In particular, we propose several ef£cient techniques for building <b>private</b> <b>circuits</b> resisting this type of attacks. We initiate a systematic study of the complexity of such <b>private</b> <b>circuits,</b> and in contrast to most prior work in this area provide a formal threat model and give proofs of security for our constructions...|$|R

50|$|A {{dedicated}} circuit, <b>private</b> <b>circuit,</b> or {{leased line}} is a line that is dedicated to only one use. Originally, this was analog, and was often used by radio stations as a studio/transmitter link (STL) or remote pickup unit (RPU) for their audio, sometimes as a backup to other means. Later lines were digital, and used for private corporate data networks.|$|E

By mid 1981, these <b>private</b> <b>circuit</b> links had been replaced with dedicated 4-wire X25 circuits over the new public Packet Switch Stream (PSS) network operating at 4.8 kbit/s.|$|E
40|$|International audience—Cryptographic {{implementations}} {{are subject}} to physical attacks. <b>Private</b> <b>circuits</b> II is a proven protection against a strong attacker, able {{to read and write}} on a finite number of chosen internal nodes. In practice, side-channel analyses and fault injections are less accurate: typically, classical injection techniques (clock and power glitches, electromagnetic pulses, etc.) can be reproducible, but they do not allow to choose the targeted nodes (the situation is different for software dual-rail with precharge logic, such as [1], [2], where (0, 1) ↔ (1, 0) bitflips are easier to achieve, since the computation is fully sequentialized [3]). So, a priori, <b>private</b> <b>circuits</b> II should be a secure protection against such classical fault injection attacks. In this paper, we provide the first implementation of <b>private</b> <b>circuits</b> II in FPGA, secure against read and/or reset of one internal wire chosen by the attacker. Our implementation is a manually coded netlist which instantiates LUT 6 2 (with dual outputs, as required for <b>private</b> <b>circuits</b> II). Our design is a SIMON block cipher programmed in a Spartan 6 Xilinx FPGA. It features a throughput of 142 Mbit/s. We perform a security analysis, and notice that some exploitable ciphertexts can be outputted despite the countermeasure. Our analysis reveals that correlated faults exist because LUT 6 2 outputs are produced almost simultaneously. In particular, the critical path actually consists in a dual-rail pair, which is consistently faulted together. If this pair is late with respect to the clock rising edge, then the previous value can be latched instead of the new one. Such fault behaves like a toggle ((01) 2 becomes (10) 2 or vice-versa) of licit values. They propagate to the ciphertext which becomes by the same token susceptible to a differential fault attack. Nonetheless, we emphasize that such faults require a steady fault injection setup: otherwise, multiple critical paths are violated, resulting in non-exploitable (fully zeroized) ciphertexts.

In this work, we introduce an efficient sidechannel protected Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) hardware design that is completely scalable in terms of protection order.

We demonstrate how to achieve resistance against multivariate higher-order attacks in the presence of glitches for the same randomness cost as the <b>private</b> <b>circuits</b> scheme. Although our AES design is scalable, it is smaller, faster, and less randomness demanding than other side-channel protected AES implementations. Our first-order secure AES design, for example, requires only 18 bits of randomness per S-box operation and 6 kGE of chip area.

5000|$|A {{system of}} tokens has been {{introduced}} by the developers because the cryptography behind the privacy enhancing features of ShadowCash require a signing scheme {{that is different from}} normal Bitcoin transactions. The signing scheme is a cryptographic computation used to prove ownership of a certain amount coins. In simplified language, the way you prove others that you own {{a certain amount of money}} on the blockchain is different for private transactions. Thus a clever system has been implemented that allows for a transaction to happen in the normal, public circuit or in the private system. When a private transaction is created it contains an ANON_MARKER in the ScriptSig to tell the nodes to use the privacy enhanced scheme instead of the normal public scheme. You can freely switch coins from the public to the <b>private</b> <b>circuit</b> and the other way around without a third party through a simple SDC to SDT or SDT to SDC transaction.|$|E

50|$|DPNSS was {{developed}} in the early 1980s by BT, or its forerunner, Post Office Telecommunications in recognition that the emerging Digital <b>Private</b> <b>Circuit</b> Primary Rate product 'Megastream' had to address the market for both data and voice, the latter being significantly greater because of the market for PBXs. At the time, BT dictated what signalling could be used on its leased lines and, whilst it only had a minority interest in the sales of PBXs, was requested by the PBX manufacturers to produce a standard to prevent the creation of a plethora of conflicting PBX protocols being developed. Under the liberalization rules of the day (1979), BT was barred from manufacturing, selling or supplying PBXs of more than 200 extensions. Digital (PCM-based) PBXs were just starting to come into the marketplace with the Plessey PDX (a licensed version of the ROLM CBX) and the GEC SL1 (a licensed version of the Northern Telecom SL1). It was recognised that corporate customers would wish to network these systems across the country. At the time, 'CAS' inter node signaling was slow and inter-register signaling MF5, developed from PSTN signalling protocols, was complex and would not support sufficient features.The support for DPNSS as BT's own signaling protocol also differentiated BT's private circuit’s services from those of its emerging rival Mercury Communications.DPNSS was an active (and successful) collaboration between PBX manufacturers and BT which started relatively slowly (BT & Plessey) but quickly snowballed with MITEL, GEC, Ericsson, Philips and eventually Nortel all joining to create a powerful and feature rich protocol.BT and some of the UK manufacturers championed DPNSS into ECMA and CCITT (ITU) but it was eventually deprecated by the standards bodies in favour of Q931 and QSig. Nevertheless, the elegance of the protocol and its compatibility with PBX features ensured the adoption DPNSS actually grew in Europe, compared to the much slower take-up of Qsig.There were also attempts (during 1984) to take DPNSS into North America. Unfortunately the structures for the creation of standards in North America seemed to prevent manufacturer collaboration as a route forward and the ANSI standards body was not interested in creating PBX interworking standards.Version 1 of BTNR188 (DPNSS) was issued in 1983; the last version of DPNSS to be released 6 in 1995 included compatibility with ISDN features released in V5. A lightweight version of DPNSS 'APNSS' {{was developed}} using analogue trunks (Sometimes compressed) and a modem to support D channel signalling.|$|E
