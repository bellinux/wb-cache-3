The authors observed that filtration characteristics were depended on the nutritional status (da Luz et al. 2014): when growing exponentially, the cultures were easier and faster to filtrate than under nutrient starved conditions, which severely clogged the filter. As these observations could not be explained by the biomass concentration, the authors hypothesized that the observed difference was probably due to changes in morphology and suggested a careful testing and—if required—also adaptation of filtration techniques to each organism and each growth phase anew. In any case, it indicates that albeit very promising, many influential aspects of filtration based separation techniques have yet to be explored.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Counting radioisotopes in {{microplates}} requires special {{technology to}} count with good efficiency and negligible crosstalk between wells. In the TopCountTM Microplate Scintillation Counter, we use time-resolved counting technology to achieve high counting efficiencies and low backgrounds {{with a single}} photomultiplier tube (PMT), which collects light {{from the top of}} the microplate well. We developed liquid and solid scintillants that produce slowly decaying pulse trains, and the electronics to discriminate true beta disintegration events from noise based on the pulse characteristics. Crosstalk is prevented by the basic design of the instrument and the use of opaque, reflective microplates. Crosstalk from 'H or 14 C is not measurable above background, whereas crosstalk from penetrating radiation, such as "I or 32 P, is measurable, but only a fraction of a percent. With the virtual absence of crosstalk, sample spectra are not corrupted by small crosstalk pulses, and the sample spectra (tSIS) can be used for reliable <b>quench</b> <b>correction.</b> With 24 -well microplates, it is possible to introduce an external standard for <b>quench</b> <b>correction</b> using the external standard spectrum (tSIE), and accurate dual-label counting can be performed.

40|$|Liquid {{scintillation}} counting of weak 3 -emitters like tritium and 14 C, {{usually involves}} <b>quench</b> <b>correction</b> with a stored quench curve, which traditionally expresses the counting efficiency {{as a function}} of a quench monitor value. Generally, the quench curve is produced by measuring chemically quenched (uncolored) calibration standards; however, if the unknown samples Contain color, the computed activity will systematically be in error when a basic quench monitor, like the isotope mean pulse height or the external standard endpoint, is used. The errors will be even more pronounced in dual label counting, as the shapes of the spectra depend on the relative amounts of color and chemical quench. In this chapter, we outline an improved <b>quench</b> <b>Correction</b> method based on the dynamic determination of both the overall quench level and the amount of color quench. The counting efficiency is computed from a quench curve which in fact should be regarded as a surface. This solution was first implemented in the Wallac 1219 Rackbeta liquid scintillation counter.

This work {{evaluated}} 2 {{types of}} liquid scintillation (LS) spectra analysis. 1) <b>Quench</b> <b>correction</b> with the trans-formed spectral index of external standard (tSIE) {{in combination with}} automatic efficiency control (AEC) is used to measure up to 3 nuclides in 1 sample with the assay type dpm (single, dual, or triple) with good accuracy even for large activity dif-ferences and beta energies close together. For this method, it is necessary <b>to</b> generate <b>quench</b> curves for each nuclide to cal-culate the dpm (disintegrations per minute) from the measured cpm (counts per minute). 2) The multinuclide spectra measured with a logarithmic x axis are deconvoluted {{with the knowledge of}} the shape of the single-nuclide spectra. In this case, the difference between the measured and fitted counts (cpm) and the real activity (dpm) has to be considered subse-quently.

40|$|Purpose 3 D {{dosimetry}} {{of small}} sized proton beams represents a challenge {{due to the}} high dose gradients with reference to detector size and increased linear energy transfer LET present in the Bragg peak. We present 3 D dose imaging results obtained using high resolution MR based polymer dosimetry at very small voxel volumes below 0. 1 mm 3 accompanied by extraordinary high signal to noise ratio. Methods and Materials Due to simplicity of preparation we use normoxic polymer gels, i. e. THPC as oxygen scavenger, which offers high dose sensitivity. Parameter selective T 2 MR micro imaging is performed at a voxel size of 250 x 250 x 1000 m 3 using a microscopy insert on a whole body 3 T MR scanner. 3 D dose maps are obtained from 25 MR slices after calibration via separate measurements on reference gels. Quenching of the Bragg Peak due to high LET is taken into account by a two parameter empirical quenching formula, derived for several dosimetric systems in the Bragg peak regime.
