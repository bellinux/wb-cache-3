40|$|As far as {{evidence}} in a criminal trial is concerned, Criminal Act no. 281 / 2003 has brought about a new procedural sanction in Romanian criminal procedure, completing article 64 in the Code of Criminal Procedure by a second para-graph, namely the exclusionary rule. The case-law of the European Court in Strasbourg is not very clear {{when it comes to}} the admissibility of illegally seized evidence against the defendant. As opposed to that, American and British common law and, following these standards, most of the traditional legal systems on the continent, acknowledge the practical use of this procedural sanction, although it is set out differently and gene-rates somewhat different effects. The said sanction is applied according to the particulars of each case, in order to achieve a just balance between the right to punish, which belongs to the state and the right to fair trial, which belongs to the suspect or the accused. In Romanian law, the unsubstantial legal provisions and the sparse case-law give no obvious answer to a series of fundamental questions related to the functioning and effects of this legal instrument: its relation to nullity, the “fruits of the poisonous tree” effect, its practical use depending on the “causes “ of illegality, the trial stage when it may be used, the procedure that governs its application and the <b>persons</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> from this right etc. Moreover, the New Code of Criminal Procedure, in spiţe of its more complex content, tends to complicate many of the problematic issues in the current criminal procedur...|$|R

Through the state social support the state contributes mainly {{to families with dependent}} children who are faced with a recognized social situation that the family is unable to cope with via its own efforts and means. The system applies the solidarity principle between high-income families and lowincome families, as well as between childless families and those with children. The system of the state social support was established in 1995 and is regulated by Act No 117 / 1995 Coll. on State Social Support, as amended. The state social support is a noncontributory system financed from the state budget. The system is applied in cases, where family's own financial means are deemed insufficient to maintain a basic standard of living. State social support benefits are currently the main form of financial support for families with children in various difficult social situations. The system is based on income testing, there is no means test.

40|$|Introduction: Risk is an {{essential}} component in the production and sale of agricultural products. Due {{to the nature of}} agricultural products, the people who act in this area including farmers and businesspersons encounter unpredictable fluctuations of prices. On the other hand, the firms that process agricultural products also face fluctuation of price of agricultural inputs. Given that the Canola is considered as one of the inputs of product processing factories, control of unpredictable fluctuations of the price of this product would increase the possibility of correct decision making for farmers and managers of food processing industries. The best available tool for control and management of the price risk is the use of future markets and options. It is evident that the pricing is the main pillar in every trade. Therefore, offering a fair price for the options will be very important. In fact, options trading in the options market create cost insurance stopped. In this way, which can reduce the risks of deflation created in the future, if the <b>person</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> the <b>benefits</b> of the price increase occurs in the future. Unlike the futures, market where the seller had to deliver the product on time, in the options market, there is no such compulsion. In addition, {{this is one of the}} strengths of this option contract, because if there is not enough product for delivery to the futures market as result of chilling, in due course, the farmers suffer, but in the options market there will be a loss. In this study, the setup options of rape, as a product, as well as inputs has been paid for industry. Materials and Methods: In this section. The selection criteria of the disposal of asset base for valuation of European put options and call option is been introduced. That for obtain this purpose, some characteristics of the goods must considered: 1 -Unpredictable fluctuations price of underlying asset 2 -large underlying asset cash market 3 - The possibility of standardizing the underlying asset 4 - Impossibility of creating cross supply of the underlying asset In addition, after the introduction of the model parameters, we offers method calculating of the volatility (standard deviation) price with using historical data (time series). Parameters of Blk- Scholes model are introduced and option contract of selected product will pricing. After effect of the rise and fall agreement prices (in the form of 9 -defined scenario) on the price of put option and sales option are studied. In this study, after forming the hypothetical option market for the Canola, option pricing is done. In this section, the criteria for selecting an appropriate asset base is expressed for option contract. The Black–Scholes model is introduced for the valuation of call option and European put option contract. After introducing the model parameters, the calculation of volatility (standard deviation) of price using historical data (time series) is presented. To achieve this aim, the Black – Scholes model was used under 9 strike price scenario of 5, 10, 15, 20 percent above; 5, 10, 15, and 20 percent lower and finally equal to current prices.
