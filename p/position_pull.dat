5000|$|Switch 3 - The switch 3 is {{basically}} a wake 360 back except that you change the direction of rotation after 180 degrees. Make a hard cut toward the wake with a palms down grip. When you reach the trough, spin around 180 degrees. Rotate to the left if you're cutting {{to the right and}} rotate to the right if you're cutting to the left. Tuck the handle into your hip. Ride up the wake while resisting it to get a good pop. Once you are in the air and not sooner, spin back to the front. As you come around, keep the handle low and let your arms extend out. Once you reach the forward <b>position,</b> <b>pull</b> the handle to your waist again and spin backward in the opposite direction. Land backwards and use your second pop to spin back to the front. It's very important to keep the handle at your waist and your head up when landing.|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} for manovolumetric investigation of rectoanal function allowing for simultaneous recording of rectal volume, anal pressure and external sphincter EMG {{in response to}} graded rectal distension was developed. Distension pressure was generated by a water column between two reservoirs. Volume was recorded as shifts of water between the reservoirs. Anal pressure was recorded with a cylindrical balloon and electromyographic activity of the external sphincter {{by means of a}} needle electrode. It could be shown that although reduction of preset pressure was minimal, this factor had {{to be taken into account}} when rectal compliance is high. The position of the patients during the investigation has to be defined, because rectal volume changed with body <b>position.</b> <b>Pull</b> through studies of anal pressure indicated low sensitivity to displacement of the cylindrical anal probe. A pressure adaptation to the anal probe during eight minutes was noted. Representative recordings of the anorectal response to different isobaric pressures are presented. The present system offers new possibilities for investigation of rectoanal physiology in man...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{will give}} an {{overview}} of gravitational waves and the history behind attempts to directly observe them using laser based interferometers and the detectors current configuration. The noise sources associated with the interferometers such as gravity gradient, seismic and quantum noise will also be discussed. Thermal noise {{will be discussed in}} depth. The main body of this thesis focused on developing and characterising a pulling machine capable of producing small diameter silica fibres for use in prototype advanced gravitational wave detectors. An initial diameter target was to pull repeatable sets of fibres with a minimum diameter ≤ 20 µm. The pulling machine worked by heating a silica stock, with one end clamped down and the other clamped to a high velocity pulling stage, with a CO 2 laser until the stock was sufficiently hot enough and producing a fibre by moving the pulling stage. The CO 2 beam was directed to and focused down onto the stock using a series of mirrors and two lenses to a beam width of 105 ± 7 µm. Three different methods were used to create fibres: one stage absolute <b>position</b> <b>pull,</b> one stage velocity profile pull and two stage velocity profile pulls. The one stage absolute <b>position</b> <b>pull</b> produced fibres that would taper down to a minimum diameter ranging between 20 to 48 µm. The one stage velocity profile pulls produced fibres ranging between 7. 4 ± 0. 4 µm and 18. 3 ± 0. 6 µm. These fibres then ranged in breaking stress values of 2. 26 ± 0. 26 × 10 ^ 8 Pa and 6. 05 ± 0. 39 × 10 ^ 9 Pa and a Young’s modulus value between 14. 4 ± 1. 7 × 10 ^ 9 Pa and 106. 0 ± 6. 8 × 10 ^ 9 Pa. The two stage velocity profile pulls produced fibres ranging between 8. 72 ± 0. 61 µm and 14. 83 ± 0. 57 µm. These fibres then ranged in breaking stress values of 2. 14 ± 0. 3 × 10 ^ 9 Pa and 4. 82 ± 0. 36 × 10 ^ 9 Pa and a Young’s modulus value between 54. 0 ± 7. 5 × 10 ^ 9 Pa and 87. 0 ± 14. 3 × 10 ^ 9 Pa. The thinnest set of fibres were produced with two stage pulls and were found to have a higher Young’s modulus value than the literature value for bulk fused silica, indicating a possible change in properties when the diameter is ≤ 10 µm. Further investigation will need to be carried out to find out if this is the case. The target of producing repeatable silica fibres with a minimum diameter ≤ 20 µm was met. There is still {{a lot of work to}} be completed with regards to perfecting the fibre’s shape, improving the strength and investigating the loss associated with the fibre. This will be carried out in the future...|$|E

50|$|Collapse {{action is}} a device {{behaviour}} that snaps a switch into place, usually using a bistable element. When flipping a light switch, strain on one spring increases until it flips <b>position,</b> <b>pulling</b> down the switch. Collapse action allows one to remove their hand from the switch without risk of it falling to the down position, as the force needed to overcome the resistance is too great. The action also does not exert force in the lower position, avoiding a spontaneous rise to the up position.|$|R

All systems investigated exhibit an oblique lattice structure with extremely large tilt angles of the chains from vertical, even at high lateral pressures. Although no large difference {{is seen in the}} isotherms, the replacement of ester by ether linkages causes a reduction of the tilt angle and of the area per molecule.

The Portuguese division was overrun and withdrew towards Estaires. The British 55th Division, to the south of the Portuguese in a more defensible <b>position,</b> <b>pulled</b> back its northern brigade and held its ground for the rest of the battle, despite attacks from two German reserve divisions.

5000|$|Choke chains (also called choke collars, slip chains, check collars, or {{training}} collars) are {{a length of}} chain with rings at either end such that the collar can be formed into a loop that slips over the dogs head and rests {{around the top of}} the dog's neck, just behind the ears. [...] When the leash is attached to the dead ring, the collar does not constrict on the dog's neck. When the leash is attached to the live ring, the chain slips (adjusts) tighter when pulled and slips looser when tension is released. Training with this leash involves a quick jerk with an immediate release, called a leash pop, snap, or correction. This is supposed to correct a dog's unwanted behavior, such as leaving the [...] "heel" [...] <b>position.</b> <b>Pulling</b> harder or longer on the choke chain presses on the dog's esophagus and restricts breathing.|$|R

50|$|The {{launcher}} {{was made}} in two parts that were joined in the middle, similar to the US 3.5” Rocket Launcher. It {{was designed to be}} fired by a soldier while prone. The weapon itself had a bipod similar to the one on the Type 99 LMG (Light Machine Gun). The gunner lay with his body at approximately a 45 degree angle to the bore on the left side while the loader was similarly positioned on the other side. The pistol grip and trigger mechanism were attached to the rear half of the launcher. A cable ran from the trigger {{to the rear of the}} launcher where the hammer was located. The hammer and firing pin was mounted on an arm. The arm was above the bore and out of the way of loading the rocket when it was in the cocked <b>position.</b> <b>Pulling</b> the trigger pulled the pin holding the arm in position and the arm swung around under spring pressure, striking the primer and igniting the rocket.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the early}} hours of the action, four unarmed {{personnel}} from the Canadian Army Film and Photo Unit arrived in St. Lambert in two jeeps. They were able to record the events as they unfolded in black and white photographs (taken by photographer Lt. Donald I. Grant) and on cine film (taken by cameraman Sgt. Jack Stollery). The cine film captures the moment when Major Currie sees a German convoy coming towards the Canadian <b>position,</b> <b>pulls</b> his pistol and steps out to take the officer commanding the convoy by surprise, forcing him to surrender his troops. Lt. Grant's still photo captures the German officer in the seconds after his surrender, his arms still in the air, and also captures Sgt.

Grant are readily available through the Library and Archives of Canada. Unfortunately the original cine film was destroyed in a fire during the 1960s while under the care of the National Film Board of Canada. Fortunately, pieces of the original footage were picked up by newsreel companies and can be seen in several newsreels released shortly after the battle.|$|R
