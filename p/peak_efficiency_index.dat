The authors use the DEA method {{in the first stage}} to estimate bank cost efficiency, and the tobit regression model in the second stage to estimate efficiency effects. The empirical results are summarized as follows: First, results indicate that risk factors impact bank efficiency. Banks with a higher degree of nonperforming loans or value at risk will see efficiency decrease by incorporating account risk. Second, there is no significant difference with the bank <b>efficiency</b> <b>index</b> taking only credit risk or market risk into consideration, but there are significant differences on the bank <b>efficiency</b> <b>index</b> in situations without risk or with credit and/or market risks.
