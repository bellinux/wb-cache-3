The company cited dangers of earthquakes and flooding. The seismically active Marikina Valley Fault System <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to Manila and the surrounding regions. Manila has endured several deadly earthquakes, notably in 1645 and in 1677 which destroyed the stone and brick medieval city.

5|$|The South Volcanic Zone has a {{long history}} of eruptions and <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the {{surrounding}} region. Any volcanic hazard—ranging from minor ashfalls to pyroclastic flows—could pose a significant risk to humans and wildlife. Despite its inactivity, Cerro Azul could again produce a major eruption; if this were to happen, relief efforts would probably be quickly organized. Teams such as the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) are prepared to effectively evacuate, assist, and rescue people threatened by volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|According to medieval scholar Richard Zeikowitz, the Green Knight {{represents}} {{a threat to}} homosocial friendship in his medieval world. Zeikowitz argues that the narrator of the poem seems entranced by the Knight's beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. The Green Knight's attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur's court and <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to their way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive as the narrator finds the Green Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code and develops a friendship with Gawain. Gawain's embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and kissed and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Nonetheless, the Green Knight blurs the lines between homosociality and homosexuality, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.|$|E

25|$|However, the boats' {{presence}} <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the animals, as it distracts {{them from}} important {{activities such as}} feeding, social interaction and reproduction. In addition, the noise produced by the motors has an adverse effect on their auditory function and reduces their ability to detect their prey, communicate, and navigate. To protect these marine animals during whale-watching activities, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has published a “Guide for observing marine life”. The guide recommends boats carrying the whale watchers keep their distance from the cetaceans and it expressly prohibits chasing, harassing, obstructing, touching, or feeding them.|$|E

25|$|In smaller towns, NWSC {{operates}} 21 sewage stabilization ponds. According to the MWE, {{an analysis}} of municipal effluents carried out in July 2008 revealed that NWSC's wastewater treatment facilities mostly do not meet national standards. Out of 223 data sets, 12 percent complied with the biochemical oxygen demand standards, 26 percent with the phosphorus standards, and 40 percent with the total suspended solids standards. This leads to the pollution of water bodies from which raw water is extracted. In a few cases, sewage was disposed directly into the environment without any treatment.

25|$|Deep ecology is an {{ecological}} and environmental philosophy promoting the inherent worth of non-human living beings {{regardless of their}} instrumental utility to human needs, plus a radical restructuring of modern human societies in accordance with such ideas. Deep ecology supports the views that the natural world is a harmony of homeostasis due to the complex inter-relationships in which the life of organisms is actively regulated, partially by the existence of other organisms within the biosphere, in order to constantly be conducive to life. These views are scientifically encouraged by living systems theory and the Gaia hypothesis.
