30|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} demonstrated that hospitalised patients with IBD have a greater <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>deficiency</b> compared with non-IBD patients [26]. Investigation of methods for improving the nutritional and functional status of IBD patients prior to discharge following resection surgery, or also efforts on an outpatient basis, would help reduce readmission rates. Increased home visits or earlier review at outpatient clinics could work in this direction.|$|E
40|$|Background: Premature {{infants with}} {{extremely}} low and very {{low birth weight}} with a severe overlapping perinatal pathology often feature slower growth rate within {{the first year of}} life and require special nutritional support. Objective: Our aim was to study physical development of infants with <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>deficiency</b> in the setting of using a specialized protein- and calorie-rich pediatric milk product for enteral feeding. Methods: We analyzed tolerability and efficacy of clinical nutrition within the framework of a prospective two-month-long case series. We assessed actual children’s diets and the chemical composition thereof. We determined body weight and length, body mass index (BMI), adipodermal flap thickness over the triceps. Anabolic effect of clinical nutrition was assessed on the basis of transthyretin concentration dynamics. Results: The study involved 30 infants with <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>deficiency</b> (7 term infants and 23 premature infants) with a severe perinatal pathology. High tolerability of the formula under analysis was registered in most patients. Termination of functional gastrointestinal tract disorders (posseting, colics, flatulence, constipations) was observed in 23 (87 %) patients. In most cases, the use of a protein- and calorie-rich formula {{as a part of a}} therapeutic diet helped to satisfy children’s protein demand and improve their weight/length parameters: BMI increased in 19 (72 %) children, body weight — in 16 (63 %), body length — in 24 (92 %), adipodermal flap thickness over the triceps — in all the children (100 %). We observed transthyretin concentration increase from 162 (157; 171) in the beginning of the study to 187 (170; 208) mg/l in the end thereof (p = 0. 028). Conclusion: A specialized protein- and calorie-rich product for enteral feeding may be used for feeding infants with <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>deficiency</b> born with a severe a perinatal pathology, including premature infants. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{in this paper}} is to understand the nutritional impact of food price changes with large numbers suffering <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>deficiency.</b> In India, {{it has been reported that}} during the 1990 s cereal consumption declined while non-cereal consumption increased. Whether this shift in consumption is a result of changes in relative prices is the focus of this analysis. In this paper we work with four food groups: wheat, rice, pulses and milk. The coefficients on income for all substitution elasticites except the one of rice with milk are significant. In all cases except milk with respect to other commodities these are positive as well. Thus with arise in income households are better able to substitute all commodities except milk with other commodities. On the other hand, the substitution elasticity of milk with respect to other commodities drops with income...|$|E
40|$|A survey {{study in}} Misamis Oriental Province {{has shown that}} {{reducing}} family size can {{be more effective than}} increasing household real income in preventing protein-calorie malnutrition among the high-risk households. Using a research design that identifies the barangays with the largest mean • family size and lowest mean household income as the stratum that has the lowest food and nutrient intake relative to the national actual intake and dietary standards, the study consistently shows that family size variable is the most important factor, even after considering the contributions of other variables, in explaining the variations observed in specific food and nutrient intake indicators. These results are useful because they answer important questions frequently asked in development plans which involves programs to raisefamily living standards through improved nutrition. Malnutrition, like the high incidence of anemia, widespread insufficiency of vitamin A, and severe <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>deficiency,</b> has devastating, immeasurable consequences on families (FAO, Nutrition Meetings Rep. No. 47, 1970). Its dramatic effects include growt...|$|E
40|$|I T IS {{generally}} accepted that kwashiorkor {{arises from the}} use of starchy foods un-supplemented by sufficient protein in the diets of children after weaning. The diets may be deficient in total protein, in essential amino acids, or in both. In some regions, caloric intakes may be adequate; ‘ in others, as in South India, weaning diets are often deficient in calories as well as in protein. 2 ’ 3 In populations in which kwashiorkor affects a small percentage of children, many others, without demonstrable signs of the syndrome, are in a suboptimal state of protein nutrition, as is evident from their retardation of growth. In India, as in a number of developing countries, the growth rate of children is considerably below western standards. The growth of rural children lags behind that of urban children, and both grow at rates considerably below those of Indian children from well to do families. 4 Such data suggest strongly that frank kwashiorkor is the obvious expression of widespread <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Biochemical indices (particularly serum al-bumin concentration) are readily available to document protein deficiency of the child with overt kwashiorkor. However, serum protein levels in the moderately undersized child may differ only slightly from those in well nourished children, and are not necessaril...|$|E
40|$|The {{endocrine}} glands of the protein-calorie deficient {{animals were}} smaller {{than those of}} pigs {{of the same age}} normally fed. However, relative to body weight, the adrenals were large, the hypophysis within the normal range, the thymus small and the pancreas and thyroid showed wide variations attributable to different degrees of oedema. In the tissues of the endocrine glands of the protein-calorie deficient animals the cells exhibited a loss of cytoplasm and, when normally present, of secretory granules, the severity of the change varying widely between the different organs of the same animal. Thus the exocrine portion of the pancreas was more severely affected than the islet tissue; within the latter =b showed greater changes than did =a. The cells of the thyroid gland were flattened and epithelioid in shape and those of the hypophysis were small, with many partially or wholly degranulated chromophiles. The zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex was usually less severely affected, with, at some stages, a relatively excessive activity which contributed to the precarious endocrine balance. Since most of the animals were killed before sexual maturity less attention was given to the gonads. Testes, however, appeared to be affected by the deficiency {{to a greater extent than}} did ovaries. The relationships between <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>deficiency,</b> hypophysectomy and an excess of corticosteroids are discussed. It is suggested that in protein=req- calorie deficiency, an adequate supply of protein for anabolic purposes is the primary factor with a subsequent alteration in hormonal secretions playing an important, but secondary, role...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} implicated {{maternal}} <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{as an important}} public health problem in developing countries. Over the last decades, a remarkable diffusion of electricity and an increased level of the electromagnetic field (EMF) in the environment have characterized modern societies. Therefore, researchers {{are concerned with the}} biological effects of 50 - 60 Hz, EMF. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show the effects of EMF of 60 Hz, 3 &# 956;T, exposure for two hours per day in the regulation of the hormonal and metabolic concentrations in pregnant rats, which were fed by Regional Basic Diet (RBD) during their pregnancy as compared with pregnant rats fed a standard diet. Pregnant rats exposed to EMF of 60 Hz, 3 &# 956;T, over the pregnancy and fed with RBD presented an increase in glucose release when compared with the Group subjected only to the RBD ration. Rats fed RBD presented a decrease in their insulin and cortisol serum levels when compared with the Group fed with casein. The T 3 and T 4 concentrations presented the greatest variation among the Groups. The relation T 4 :T 3 was much exaggerated in the Group subjected to RDB and exposed to EMF when compared to the others. In conclusion, the group subjected to the association of EMF and undernutrition suffered a decrease in its serum concentration of T 4 and T 3 when compared to the well-nourished group and the relationship T 4 :T 3 in the former group was almost eighteen-fold the later one...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{absolute}} and relative concentrations of 16 plasma amino acids in 48 mostly dystrophic {{infants and children}} (median of age 11 A years) with extrahepatic biliary atresia and mainly stable preterminal cirrhosis were {{compared with those of}} controls. Patient plasma amino acid data were analysed statistically for diagnostic usefulness and correlated with standard biochemical quantities of liver function and of liver perfusion. In the patients the total amounts of non-essential and essential amino acids were reduced by 19 %, and with the same significance (p < 0. 0005). Plasma tyrosine was increased (+ 40 %), while taurine (— 44 %) and branched chain amino acids (+ 28. 8 % to — 34. 7 %) were decreased. Methionine values varied widely. In the molar fractional plasma amino acid profile, only alanine, valine, and leucine were decreased, while threonine, methionine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, ornithine, and serine were increased. Discriminate function analysis showed that the plasma amino acid data discriminated 93. 8 % of the patients from controls. The concentrations of some amino acids in plasma seemed to have been influenced by <b>protein-calorie</b> <b>deficiency</b> in the patients. The valine/tyrosine ratio and the Fischer index (ratio branched chain/aromatic amino acids) were significantly reduced in the patients versus controls (1. 54 + 0. 55 vs 3. 08 + 0. 55 and 1. 66 + 0. 39 vs 3. 00 + 0. 48). A number of significant correlations (range of r: 0. 37 — 0. 59, p < 0. 05, 30 — 48 data pairs) were calculated between plasma amino acid data and several standard biochemical quantities of liver function. The statistical analyse...|$|E
