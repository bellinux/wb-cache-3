25|$|Law 39: Stumped. A batsman is {{out when}} the wicket-keeper (see Law 27) <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> wicket, while the batsman is out of his crease and not {{attempting}} a run.|$|E
25|$|If the batsman {{facing the}} bowler (the striker) {{steps out of}} his ground to play the ball but misses and the wicket-keeper takes the ball and <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> wicket, then the striker is out stumped.|$|E
25|$|In detail, {{suppose the}} horse starts by lifting its left front leg (the other three feet are {{touching}} the ground). It then lifts its right hind leg (while being {{supported by the}} diagonal pair front right and left hind). Next, the left front foot touches the ground (the horse is now supported by all but the right hind leg); then the horse lifts its right front leg (it is now supported laterally on both left legs), and shortly afterwards it sets down the right rear leg (only the front right leg is now lifted). Then it lifts its left rear leg (diagonal support), <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> front right (lateral support), lifts the left front, <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rear left, and the pattern repeats.|$|E

500|$|Roger Moore of The Seattle Times showed mixed {{feelings}} in his review: [...] "Rare is the thriller that goes as completely and utterly wrong as The Call does at almost precisely the one-hour mark. Which is a crying shame, because {{for an hour}} this is a riveting, by-the-book kidnapping." [...] Moore explained {{what he saw as}} the highs and lows: [...] "Brad Anderson turns this...serial-killer hunt...into a real edge-of-your-seat thriller. Given...a half-decent tale of horror, guilt, problem-solving and redemption, Anderson couldn't go far wrong," [...] but, Moore states, [...] "It's only when our Oscar-winning heroine <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> phone and sets out to do some sleuthing of her own that The Call disconnects, turning into something far more generic and far less exciting." [...] The Los Angeles Times turned in a similar review: [...] "The semi-fresh thriller, set mainly in an emergency call center and on the freeways of Los Angeles, puts a tech slant on a damsel-in-distress setup. It buzzes along for a while, the promising plot innovations inviting suspension of disbelief, before by-the-numbers implausibility, over-the-top valor and unsavory contrivances take over and the line goes dead." ...|$|E

2500|$|A batsman is not run out if {{the ball}} has not been touched by a fielder, after the bowler has {{delivered}} the ball, before the wicket is put down.

[...] On the very day of his {{coronation}} in 1120, Kelson is challenged by Hogan's daughter Charissa, but the young king manages to defeat the Deryni sorceress. [...] The following year, Kelson meets the invasion of King Wencit Furst√°n of Torenth and succeeds in defeating Wencit in arcane combat, gaining dominion over Torenth through his victory. [...] Several years later, a new Mearan Pretender rises up to seek Mearan independence, but Kelson mounts a military campaign into Meara in 1124 and successfully <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rebellion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{narrative}} of the poem focuses on a Chinese immigrant character named Ah Sin who is playing the card game euchre with two white men on August 3 of an unspecified year. [...] "Truthful James", {{one of the men}} who narrates the poem, observes that the other white man, Bill Nye, is cheating with a stacked deck and cards up his sleeve. They both seemed to think Ah Sin was childlike and did not understand the game. Nevertheless, Ah Sin plays well and soon <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> same card that Nye had dealt to the narrator. Thinking their opponent is cheating, Nye fights Ah Sin and discovers he has several decks hidden in his clothes.|$|E
2500|$|Although Nick {{is only a}} semi-regular character, his {{intermittent}} appearances {{were always}} scripted {{to make a big}} impact on the show, as well as all the characters involved in his storylines. He reappeared and left several times during {{the first few years of}} the show, causing maximum havoc every time, and it wasn't long before the tabloids had begun to brand the character [...] "Nasty Nick". Altman has commented: [...] "I think they keep bringing Nick back because he's one of the characters on British TV that people just love to hate". This dislike of the character by the public was shared by the fictional residents of Walford, with Altman explaining: [...] "Every time he comes back he gets shunned by one and all. It's like being the bad cowboy come riding into town - everybody <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> shutters and locks up the bar." [...] The character's appearance was tailored to suit this unlikable, [...] "nasty" [...] image, with EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown commenting; [...] "When he comes on, you know this guy is bad. He's got the black hair and the scowl and the leather jacket. He is like that, he is a Dickensian baddy." [...] Frankie Fitzgerald, who played Nick's son Ashley Cotton from 2000 to 2001, agreed: [...] "The look of Nasty Nick, you know, he was a bad guy. Even when he gets dressed up in a suit, he's still got the earring, he's still got the rings, he's still got the tattoo on his neck." ...|$|E
