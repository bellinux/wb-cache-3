40|$|The {{emergence}} of new risk management tools such as revenue insurance has dramatically expanded the tools from which producers may choose to manage revenue risk. Little is known regarding how these products interact with market-based risk management tools such as futures and options. Our analysis addresses this issue by examining optimal futures and <b>put</b> <b>ratios</b> under increasing levels of insurance coverage. Four alternative insurance designs are examined. Two are yield triggered and two reflect currently available revenue insurance designs. The analysis is conducted by using a revenue simulation model which incorporates four random variables; futures price, basis, county yield, and farm-county yield differences. Optimal hedge and at-the-money <b>put</b> options <b>ratios</b> are derived for an expected utility maximizing corn producer in four distinct geographical regions. Revenue insurance tends to result in slightly lower hedging demand than would occur given {{the same level of}} yield insurance coverage. To the extent that producers would switch from yield insurance to revenue insurance there would be a decline in the demand for hedging. If a person were to go from being uninsured to the purchase of one of the insurance designs, we fmd that the revenue products result in a hedge ratio that is at least as high as the uninsured case when considering the permissible levels of coverage...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims Plant growth {{regulators}} play {{an important}} role in seed germination. However, much of the current knowledge about their function during seed germination was obtained using orthodox seeds as model systems, and there is a paucity of information about the role of plant growth regulators during germination of recalcitrant seeds. In the present work, two endangered woody species with recalcitrant seeds, Araucaria angustifolia (Gymnosperm) and Ocotea odorifera (Angiosperm), native to the Atlantic Rain Forest, Brazil, were used to study the mobilization of polyamines (PAs), indole-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) during seed germination. Methods Data were sampled from embryos of O. odorifera and embryos and megagametophytes of A. angustifolia throughout the germination process. Biochemical analyses were carried out in HPLC. Key Results During seed germination, an increase in the (Spd + Spm) : <b>Put</b> <b>ratio</b> was recorded in embryos in both species. An increase in IAA and PA levels was also observed during seed germination in both embryos, while ABA levels showed a decrease in O. odorifera and an increase in A. angustifolia embryos throughout the period studied. Conclusions The (Spd + Spm) : <b>Put</b> <b>ratio</b> could be used as a marker for germination completion. The increase in IAA levels, prior to germination, could be associated with variations in PA content. The ABA mobilization observed in the embryos could represent a greater resistance to this hormone in recalcitrant seeds, in comparison to orthodox seeds, opening a new perspective for studies on the effects of this regulator in recalcitrant seeds. The gymnosperm seed, though without a connective tissue between megagametophyte and embryo, seems to be able to maintain communication between the tissues, based on the likely transport of plant growth regulators.

Due to the complex relationship between casting defects and greens and properties, it is imperative to control many greens and characteristics that influence casting quality.

To understand the physiological mechanism of 1 BL/ 1 RS translocation responsible for osmotic stress, two wheat cultivars, CN 12 and CN 17, carrying the translocated chromosome and MY 11 without the translocated chromosome {{were employed in}} the study. During 5 -day osmotic stress, fresh weight inhibition, chlorophyll content, soluble protein content, MDA concentration, antioxidant enzymes activity and free polyamines content were examined. CN 12 and CN 17, especially cultivar CN 17, registered greater biomass and minor oxidative damage compared with their wheat parent.

In addition, we found a positive correlation of fresh weight inhibition (FWI) and Put concentration, and a negative one with the parameters (Spd + Spm) : <b>Put</b> <b>ratio,</b> indicating the importance of higher polyamine (Spd and Spm) accumulation on the adaptation to osmotic stress.

We conduct statistical tests across time, across firms, and across both simultaneously to identify informed trading under the assumption of a semi efficient market; and investigate any preferences an informed investor might have with regard to selected firm characteristics and timing. We discover evidence of unusual trading patterns one day prior to large spikes in abnormal returns, and find supporting evidence that informed traders prefer out-of-the-money compared to at-the-money and in-the-money options. However, we do not find any significant linkage between a company’s market value or priceto-book-value, or that the amount of informed trading in the option market has decreased with time...|$|R

Whilst the sale price of new apartments rises, a particular type of blockbusting limits the choices of the low-income residents to selling at a good price or staying <b>put.</b> The <b>ratio</b> between the different ground rent levels captured either by developers and original owner-residents confirms the extensive power deployed by the large-scale real estate firms at the moment of gentrifying central areas {{and the extent to which}} they generate residential displacement.
