Construction is expected to take two years and the interchange should be open by the end of 2018.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, Wessex Trains, {{the company}} {{managing}} the {{station at the}} time, introduced car parking charges. It was noted that this resulted in less use of the car parks, more local street <b>parking</b> <b>and</b> caused people to drive to Nailsea and Backwell railway station, where parking was still free. Following local pressure, the charges were reduced in July 2005.|$|E

5|$|Other {{projects}} {{include the}} realignment of Donelson Pike {{to the east}} and a multi-modal transit link to a future Nashville transit system. Construction began in 2017 on the new <b>Parking</b> <b>and</b> Transportation Center. To accommodate the immediate need for more international service, the existing international arrivals building is being upgraded on an interim basis while the permanent IAB is planned and constructed.|$|E
5|$|Taxis, paid <b>parking</b> <b>and</b> {{car rental}} is {{available}} at the airport. Driving time to the town center is about five to seven minutes. There is a bus service operated by Torghatten Trafikkselskap form the airport to the town center; onwards connection is available to several areas in Helgeland and Namdalen. Ferry and fast ferry services are also operated from the town center to nearby islands. The 44-room Thon Hotel Torghatten is located next to the airport.|$|E
5|$|The Yoyogi National Gymnasium is {{situated}} in an open area in Yoyogi Park on an adjacent axis to the Meiji Shrine. The gymnasium and swimming pool were designed by Tange for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, which were the first Olympics held in Asia. Tange began his designs in 1961 and the plans were approved by the Ministry of Education in January 1963. The buildings were placed to optimize space available for <b>parking</b> <b>and</b> to permit the smoothest transition of incoming and outgoing people.|$|E

5|$|The plan {{included}} narrowing 3rd Avenue from four-lanes westbound {{towards the}} Robert C. Byrd Bridge to one-lane {{in each direction}} with angled parking, however, this was later revised to one-lane in each direction with parallel <b>parking</b> <b>and</b> a center variable lane. The road narrowing plan was envisioned as a traffic calming measure.|$|E
5|$|There {{is above}} ground <b>parking</b> <b>and</b> {{three levels of}} {{underground}} parking available, able to accommodate 2,363 cars in a subterranean garage and 126 more spots above ground. A car wash, detail, and repair service is available to residents in the underground parking lot. The concierge service offers courtesy bus rides to local shopping destinations. Express buses to Manhattan leave regularly {{from the front of}} each of the three buildings.|$|E
5|$|A revised design {{turned the}} {{mezzanine}} floor {{into an area}} {{that could be used}} as an arts venue, cinema, music auditorium or conference room for 120 to 150people. New plans cost £60,000. However this new design was deemed to be unworkable. A second design consisted of another six-storey building with a large ground-floor shop, a first-storey car park, and four floors of flats. This would have been half a metre less in height than the previous design, and did not include the tower. The plan was initially rejected by the council, but was subsequently approved in April 2008, before being rejected by the Planning Inspectorate. Several later applications for the site were also rejected, particularly due to concerns over <b>parking,</b> <b>and</b> the site was vacant as of June 2015.|$|E

5|$|In November 2004, Congress {{appropriated}} $700,000 for the NWR {{to cover}} the costs of designing a public visitor’s center. By 2005 construction had progressed on public facilities at the site that included trails, observations decks, <b>parking,</b> <b>and</b> an entrance from Oregon Route 99W with plans for permanently opening to the public in 2006. In July 2005, the refuge received $3.9 million from the federal government to complete a visitor’s center and new headquarters for the facility. In February 2006, construction began on the main observation deck at the visitor’s plaza, with plans to open the refuge to the public in June.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s the {{dovecote}} was inspected {{as part of}} {{an investigation}} into an outbreak of psittacosis (also known as parrot disease or parrot fever), a zoonotic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci, at the adjoining King's School. No cause was found for the infection. In 2010 restoration work was undertaken including repairs to the tops of the walls; these are exposed as the building no longer has a roof. Wall ties were used on the south west corner where the masonry was bulging. In addition, car <b>parking</b> <b>and</b> educational signage was provided. This was partially funded by South Somerset council, Bruton Town Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund to a total of £105,000.|$|E
5|$|Newsom {{attended}} Redwood High School {{and graduated}} from Santa Clara University. After graduation, he co-founded businesses with family friend Gordon Getty, who was an investor. Newsom began his political career in 1996 when San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown appointed him {{to serve on the}} city's <b>Parking</b> <b>and</b> Traffic Commission and {{as a member of the}} Board of Supervisors the following year. In 2003 he was elected as the 42nd Mayor of San Francisco, the city's youngest in a hundred years. Newsom was re-elected in 2007 with 72 percent of the vote. He was elected Lieutenant Governor of California in 2010 and re-elected in 2014.|$|E

In 1996, Brown appointed Newsom to a vacant seat on the <b>Parking</b> <b>and</b> Traffic Commission, and he was later {{elected president of the}} commission. In 1997, Brown appointed him to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors seat vacated by Kevin Shelley. At the time, he became the youngest member of San Francisco's board of supervisors and also, like Shelley before him, the board's only heterosexual Caucasian male.|$|E
5|$|Regional airports, such as Edinburgh Airport, have {{experienced}} strong growth in CAT operations in recent years. These operations are commercially and operationally incompatible with GA, {{and although there}} is no evidence of deliberate discrimination, the effect has been to discourage or exclude it. GA aircraft are being subject to significant increases in charges, including the imposition of handling fees in some cases. Some airports restrict or deny GA <b>parking,</b> <b>and</b> others limit or refuse certain GA activity. As a result, light GA aircraft are now rarely or never seen at large, busy international airports such as Heathrow, Stansted, Gatwick and Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Southcote {{is within}} Thames Valley Police's catchment, and is grouped as a {{neighbourhood}} with Norcot. Residents identified nuisance and illegal <b>parking</b> <b>and</b> excessive speed as {{of concern in}} the area, {{as well as the}} antisocial use of mini motos, quad bikes and motorcycles on the Kennet towpath. Measures to alleviate nuisance parking were introduced in early 2015 with a ban on parking on the road verge. In June 2015, signs were installed on the lane to Southcote Mill to warn motorcycle users of their prohibition on that right of way.|$|E

5|$|The {{buildings}} stand above a {{warren of}} tunnels: previously, live animals {{were brought to}} market by hoof (from the mid-19th century onwards they arrived by rail) and were slaughtered on site. The former railway tunnels are now used for storage, <b>parking</b> <b>and</b> as basements. An impressive cobbled ramp spirals down around West Smithfield's public garden, {{on the south side}} of the Market, providing access to part of this area. Some of the buildings on Charterhouse Street on Smithfield north side maintain access to the tunnels via their basements.|$|E
