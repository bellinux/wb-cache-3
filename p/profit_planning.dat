40|$|This paper {{argues that}} prior studies {{investigating}} {{the determinants of}} <b>profit</b> sharing <b>plan</b> adoption fail to consider the effect of current earnings changes on future expected compensation payments under profit sharing that underlie the success of profit sharing in motivating employees. When current earnings changes are caused by factors that make earnings too volatile then the payments under profit sharing are volatile and their predictability is reduced. In this situation, profit sharing {{is not expected to}} be successful in motivating employees and would not be a preferred means of compensation. In contrast, if earnings changes are caused by factors that produce more sustainable effects on earnings, rendering them more reliable and predictable, then compensation payments under profit sharing will be more predictable and representative of employees' efforts. In this case, profit sharing would be more successful in motivating employees and {{is more likely to be}} adopted as a preferred compensation scheme. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that a positive association exists between the level of permanence of current earnings changes and the adoption of <b>profit</b> sharing <b>plans.</b> Permanence of earnings changes is measured by the level of earnings persistence which is computed using two alternative time-series models: IMA (1, 1) and ARIMA (2, 1, 0). A Logit model is used to evaluate the effect of earnings persistence and control variables on the probability of adoption of employee <b>profit</b> sharing <b>plans.</b> <b>Profit</b> sharing data is extracted from the U. S. IRS 5500 Form while financial data for the sample firms are retrieved from Compustat. The final sample includes 298 firms that are equally split between profit sharing and non-profit sharing firms. The test results indicate that information about persistence of earnings innovations is a significant determinant of <b>profit</b> sharing <b>plan</b> adoption. Earnings persistence is positively associated with the probability of <b>profit</b> sharing <b>plan</b> adoption. This result is robust when the alternative measure of earnings persistence is used and the control variables are included.

In order to design the <b>profit</b> <b>planning,</b> there are three techniques of analysis that have been used, they are: cost volume profit analysis which include break even point analysis (BEP), degree of operating leverage analysis (DOL), margin of safety analysis (MOS); least square method; and time series analysis.

The results of cost volume profit analysis in Situ Gunung Nature Tourism Park for the year of 2004 and 2005 shows that the source of revenues consist of ticketing, normal camping, and parking which considered to be potential enough in producing profit.

40|$|The {{perspective}} of agency theory has greatly increased {{our understanding of}} the relationship between top executives and boards of directors, but it has been less successful at explaining the behavior observed at lower levels of firm hierarchies. In particular, agency theory has a difficult time explaining why firms make payments to rank and file employees via <b>profit</b> sharing <b>plans</b> based on overall company performance. We use data from the European version of the Watson Wyatt Human Capital Index Employer Survey to examine an alternative explanation for the use of these <b>plans</b> that regards <b>profit</b> sharing <b>plans</b> as a means by which firms commit ex ante to sharing the gains of investments in specific human capital with employees. Our results are preliminary, but they seem to support this hypothesis. Our results indicate that <b>profit</b> sharing <b>plans</b> are used to align the objectives of employees with those of the firm. However, these plans are not used to elicit optimal effort levels, but instead are used to elicit optimal investment in specific skills. <b>Profit</b> sharing <b>plans</b> appear to function as a safeguard in the employment relationship that mitigates potential hold-ups by employers.

In an attempt to remedy this situation it was suggested that a method be found of constructing a system to improve the flexibility of cost control procedures. The work involved an assimilation of the industrial and financial environment via pilot studies which would later prove invaluable to home in on the really interesting and important areas. Weaknesses in the current systems which came to light made the methodology of data collection and the improvement of cost control and <b>profit</b> <b>planning</b> procedures easier to adopt.
