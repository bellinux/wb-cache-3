5|$|There {{are three}} such <b>plats</b> {{depicting}} naval actions and expeditions that {{are attributed to}} Anthony: the route of Anne of Cleves from the Low Countries to England (1539), a French attack on a coastal fort (date unknown) and a French raid on Brighton (July 1545). The design of the ships in these paintings, especially that of the Brighton raid, closely match those in the rolls. It is not known exactly when work on the rolls began nor when it was finished. It is only certain that it {{was presented to the}} king the year it was dated, 1546. The inclusion of the Mary Rose that sank at the Battle of the Solent 19 July 1545 does not mean it was necessarily started before this date, since it was still considered possible that she could be raised even as late as 1549. The galleasses, the Antelope, Hart, Bull and Tiger, all present in the second roll, were still being built around March 1546, and the Hart was not at sea until October that year. At the same time the Galley Blanchard, captured from the French 18 May 1546 is not included.|$|E
25|$|Particularly in New England, {{this system}} was {{supplemented}} by drawing town <b>plats.</b> The metes-and-bounds system {{was used to}} describe a town of a generally rectangular shape, 4 to 6 miles (~6 to 10km) on a side.

25|$|Other {{achievements}} by Thomson and Cotterill in {{this era}} included 25 miles of bicycle trails (later {{the basis of the}} city's Olmsted boulevard system) the filling of tideflats that compose much of today's SoDo and Industrial District south of Downtown Seattle, and the development of the <b>plats</b> that still determine the general plan of the piers on Seattle's Central Waterfront. Each pier is more or less a parallelogram. Most earlier piers, none of which survive, formed a perfect right angle to the shore, and the curvature of the shore meant that each pier was at a slightly different angle, causing potential for collisions. Their uniform northeast-southwest direction was prescribed by Thomson and Cotterill not only solved that problem but also spared freight trains from needing to make a sharp right angle.|$|E

25|$|Spain ceded Florida to the British in 1763 {{after the}} French and Indian War, and the British soon {{constructed}} the King's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia. The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British called the Cow Ford; these names ostensibly {{reflect the fact}} that cattle were brought across the river there. The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits, as well the export of lumber. As a result, the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish. Britain ceded control of the territory to Spain in 1783, after being defeated in the American Revolutionary War, and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow. After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821, American settlers {{on the north side of}} the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and <b>plats.</b> They soon named the town Jacksonville, after Andrew Jackson. Led by Isaiah D. Hart, residents wrote a charter for a town government, which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9, 1832.|$|E

It may also mean [...] "deer robes," [...] referring to their excellent skill for hunting deer. In some written records from the early 19th century, also by the French, the Ktunaxa were sometimes called the Flatbows (Arcs <b>plats)</b> and the river called the Flatbow River.

Only two roads, Interstate 5 and State Route 99 (both limited-access highways), run uninterrupted through the city from north to south. State Route 99 runs through downtown Seattle on the Alaskan Way Viaduct, which was built in 1953. However, due to damage sustained during the 2001 Nisqually earthquake the viaduct will be replaced by a tunnel. The [...] Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel was originally scheduled to be completed in December 2015 at a cost of US$4.25billion. Unfortunately, due to issues with the worlds largest tunnel boring machine (TBM), which is nicknamed [...] "Bertha" [...] and is [...] in diameter, the projected date of completion has been pushed back to 2017.

At that point Fletcher skipped town, leaving the community with a huge water debt.

40|$|In {{order to}} gain insight into the {{phylogeny}} and physiological significance of organic-anion-binding proteins in the liver, the hepatic glutathione S-transferases of rat and a typical elasmobranch, the thorny-back shark (Platyrhinoides triseriata), were compared with respect to both glutathione S-transferase activites and organic-anion-binding properties. On gel filtration (Sephadex G- 75, Superfine grade) of rat cytosol, the elution volumes of enzyme activities with 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene and p-nitrobenzyl chloride as substrates were identical (rat Y-fractions; Mr 45000). In contrast, two peaks of enzyme activity for 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene with elution volumes corresponding to Mr 52000 (<b>PLAT</b> Y 1) and Mr 45000 (<b>PLAT</b> Y 2) were detected on gel filtration of P. triseriata cytosol. Only fraction <b>PLAT</b> Y 2 had enzyme activity with p-nitrobenzyl chloride. Enzyme kinetic studies showed that rat Y-fraction had higher affinities for both 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene and glutathione than <b>PLAT</b> Y 1 - and <b>PLAT</b> Y 2 -fractions. The two forms of P. triseriata glutathione S-transferases differed greatly in affinity for glutathione. At a glutathione concentration that we found to be physiological in P. triseriata, <b>PLAT</b> Y 2 accounted for approx. 70 % of the total glutathione S-transferase activity with 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene. Binding studies revealed that <b>PLAT</b> Y 1 and <b>PLAT</b> Y 2 fractions had much lower affinities for sulphobromophthalein and bilirubin than rat Y-fraction. In contrast, binding affinities of <b>PLAT</b> Y 1 and <b>PLAT</b> Y 2 for Rose Bengal and 1 -anilino- 8 -naphthalenesulphonate were comparable with that of rat Y-fraction. Inhibitory kinetics suggested that sulphobromophthalein and Rose Bengal were non-competitive inhibitors of glutathione S-transferase activities when 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene was used as substrate for both <b>PLAT</b> Y 1 and <b>PLAT</b> Y 2. The major glutathione S-transferase from the <b>PLAT</b> Y 2 fraction was purified 81 -fold by sequential chromatography on Sephadex G- 75, DEAE-Sephadex and hydroxyapatite, and consisted of two identical subunits with pI 7. 7.
