5|$|Follow-ups of {{untreated}} {{people over}} thirty {{with a history}} of severe allergic reactions would greatly benefit from venom immunotherapy. Both rapid and slow doses can be done safely during immunotherapy. The efficacy (capacity to induce a therapeutic effect) of ant venom immunotherapy is effective in reducing systemic reactions in comparison to placebo and whole body extract immunotherapy, where patients were more likely to suffer from a systemic reaction. Ultrarush initiation of insect immunotherapy may be used, but results show higher risks of allergic reactions. Despite immunotherapy being successful, only ten <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> do not have any response to desensitisation.|$|E
5|$|In {{individuals}} {{allergic to}} the venom (about 2–3% of the population), a sting sometimes causes anaphylactic shock. In comparison to other insects {{such as the}} western honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the European wasp (Vespula germanica), their rates are only 1.4% and 0.6%. The annual sting exposure rates for the jack jumper ant, Western honeybee and European wasp are 12%, 7% and 2%. The median time from sting to cardiac arrest is 15 minutes, but the maximum period is around three hours. The ant allergy does not disappear; people with jack jumper allergies will most likely suffer from another allergic reaction if re-stung. Approximately 70 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> {{with a history of}} systemic reaction to the ant's sting have another reaction when stung again. In comparison, systemic reaction figures for Apis mellifera and Vespula germanica after being stung show a rate of 50% and 25%. About half of these reactions were life-threatening and occurred predominantly in people who had had previous incidents with the sting. Anaphylaxis in jack jumper ant stings are not rare; 2.9% of 600 residents from semi-rural Victoria had allergic reactions to the ant's sting, according to a questionnaire. The sensitivity to stings is persistent for many years.|$|E

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{performed}} in order to detect the frequency {{of different types of}} precocious puberty, predisposing factors and to show which group <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> need to treatment. Materials and Methods: In this study, 74 patients who referred to pediatric endocrine clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital and private office from 1993 - 2000 were assessed. A complete history was taken and physical examination was done in all patients by pediatrics endocrinologist. Bone age was done in all patients and specific hormonal tests were measured in some of them. Results: Among 74 patients, 50 cases (67. 6 percent) were female and 24 cases (32. 4 percent) were male. The age <b>of</b> the <b>patients</b> was between 0. 8 - 10 years old with mean 5. 37 year. 75 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> male <b>patients</b> had central (complete) precocious puberty and 25 percent had peripheral (incomplete) precocious puberty. 40 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> female <b>patients</b> had central precocious puberty, 46 percent had premature telarche, 8 percent had premature pubarche, 2 percent had premature menarche and 4 percent had other kinds of precocious puberty (one case with hypothyroidism and one case with Mccune-Albright syndrome). 10 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> female <b>patients</b> with central precocious puberty had predisposing factor and 90 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> them were idiopathic. 38. 8 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> male <b>patients</b> with central precocious puberty had predisposing factor and 61. 2 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> them were idiopathic. 100 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> male <b>patients</b> with peripheral precocious puberty had congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia. 38 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> female <b>patients</b> and 100 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> male <b>patients</b> needed to treatment. Conclusion: According to this study and references, precocious puberty in female usually benign but in male patients it should be evaluated thoroughly because they usually have a serious disorder which needs treatment...|$|R

Seventy-six <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>patients</b> with C. tropicalis fungemia and 32. 5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> those with C. albicans fungemia had either leukemia or lymphoma. Seventy-seven <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the C. parapsilosis fungemias {{were related to}} total parenteral nutrition.

Progressive disease occurred in 49 patients and the time to progression was a median of 12 months (range of four to 52 months).
