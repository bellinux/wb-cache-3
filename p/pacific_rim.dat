5|$|The <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim</b> {{award was}} {{introduced}} in 1995, the year after two Australian swimmers—Kieren Perkins and Samantha Riley—became the first two <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim</b> swimmers to be named as World Swimmer of the Year. It has subsequently been dominated by Australian swimmers, who have won 24 of the 32 awards given. Ian Thorpe won six awards (five consecutively) and Susie O'Neill has won four (three consecutively). Australia’s success has been built on female butterfliers (O’Neill and Petria Thomas), female breaststrokers (Riley and Leisel Jones), and male freestylers (Thorpe, Grant Hackett and Michael Klim). The men's awards have been dominated by Asian swimmers since 2006. Kosuke Kitajima (Japan) was the first non-Australian swimmer to win the award more than once (in 2003, 2007, 2008, and 2010). He was followed by Sun Yang of China who won three awards (in 2011, 2012, and 2013).|$|E
5|$|Bat dung {{has been}} mined as guano from caves {{and used as}} fertilizer. Bats are natural {{reservoirs}} of many diseases including rabies; since they are highly mobile, social, and long-lived, they can readily spread diseases. Bats are sometimes numerous enough to serve as tourist attractions, and are used as food across Asia and the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim.</b> In many cultures, bats are popularly associated with darkness, death, witchcraft and malevolence.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Australian {{swimmers}} won both {{awards for}} World Swimmer of the Year {{for the first}} time, and in 1995, a subcategory was inaugurated for <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim</b> swimmers. A subcategory for disabled swimmers was introduced in 2003, and in the following year, an African award was launched after South Africa became the first country from the continent to win an Olympic relay. In 2005, open water swimming {{was added to the}} Olympic program and another category was duly added.|$|E
5|$|In February 1974, the British Prime Minister, Edward Heath, {{advised the}} Queen {{to call a}} general {{election}} {{in the middle of}} her tour of the Austronesian <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim,</b> requiring her to fly back to Britain. The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party, but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the Liberals. Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a coalition foundered, after which the Queen asked the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Harold Wilson, to form a government.|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 2013, Monteith {{was found}} dead in his room at the Fairmont <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim</b> hotel in Vancouver, British Columbia.

On July 20, 2013, Ryan Murphy said in various media outlets that Cory would have a tribute in season five's third episode, which would deal with the death of Monteith's character, Finn.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} {{of only one}} female character of note resulted in <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim</b> not passing the Bechdel test. This became a topic of discussion {{in the media and}} on the Internet. Opinions were divided between those pointing to the film as an example of Hollywood's practice of ostracizing women, and those noting that the film did not sexually objectify Mako Mori and gave her a narrative arc not revolving around a man.|$|E
5|$|Canada was a {{founding}} member of the United Nations and has membership in the World Trade Organization, the G20 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Canada is also a member of various other international and regional organizations and forums for economic and cultural affairs. Canada acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1976. Canada joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in 2000 and the 3rd Summit of the Americas in 2001. Canada seeks to expand its ties to <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim</b> economies through membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).|$|E
5|$|Liukin's {{first meet}} of the 2008 season was the American Cup in New York City, where she {{defeated}} 2007 winner Shawn Johnson to regain her title. She posted the highest {{score of the}} meet, a 16.600 on the uneven bars. In March, Nastia competed at the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim</b> (formerly Pacific Alliance) Championships in San Jose, where she led the American team to a gold medal and won the all-around and balance beam titles. In the team competition, Liukin posted an all-time high score of 16.650 on the uneven bars, but in event finals, she fell on her Gienger release move {{and took a step}} on her dismount, earning a 15.225 and taking second place.|$|E
5|$|Records of {{historical}} earthquakes and tsunami extend further {{back in time}} in Japan {{than any other country}} that lies along the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim</b> (the first documented event occurred in 416 AD). These historical documents supported the date verification of the 1700 Cascadia earthquake that occurred off the Pacific northwest coast of North America. The dilemma of earthquakes in Japan was made a priority following the 1854 Ansei-Nankai event that brought great destruction to the southwest portion of the country. With the onset of the Meiji period, the feudal government system was superseded by an empire that began to focus on advancing the Japanese society up to Western standards, especially in science.|$|E
5|$|There {{are only}} two exposed {{contacts}} of Siletzia with the older (pre-Cenozoic) North American basement. One is near Roseburg, Oregon, where it is thrust against formations of the Klamath Mountains (discussed below), the other is along the Leech River Fault on {{the southern end of}} Vancouver Island, where it has pushed the pre-Cenozoic <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim</b> formation beneath the Wrangellia Terrane). Everywhere else the contact between Siletzia {{and the rest of the}} continent is concealed under younger deposits, especially the Cascade Range volcanics. The contact around the Olympic Mountains is actually the bottom contact with the underlying oceanic sediments, tilted up by the uplift of the Olympics and exposed by erosion of about 10 to 12km of overlying deposits.|$|E
5|$|In the Pacific Northwest {{there is}} a stark {{contrast}} in Riesling production. The grape is currently {{on the rise in}} Washington State but on the decline in neighboring Oregon. Riesling from this area ranges from dry to sweet, and has a crisp lightness that bodes well for easy drinking. Often there will be an easily detectable peach and mineral complex. Some Washington State winemakers, such as Chateau Ste. Michelle, are adapting German-style Riesling production methods, and even partnering with well-known German vintners like Dr. Ernest Loosen to create specialty wines such as the Eroica Riesling. With annual productions of over 2,000,000 cases a year, Chateau Ste. Michelle is the worldwide leader in the production of Riesling wines by volume. In 2007 <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim</b> Winemakers, another Pacific Northwest winery and owned by Randall Grahm of Bonny Doon, has built the first wine facility in Red Mountain AVA dedicated completely to Riesling production.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim</b> is a 2013 American {{science fiction}} monster film {{directed}} by Guillermo del Toro and starring Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Burn Gorman, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini, and Ron Perlman. The screenplay {{was written by}} Travis Beacham and del Toro from a story by Beacham. The film {{is set in the}} future, when Earth is at war with the Kaiju, colossal monsters which have emerged from an interdimensional portal {{on the bottom of the}} Pacific Ocean. To combat the monsters, humanity unites to create the Jaegers, gigantic humanoid mechas each controlled by at least two pilots, whose minds are joined by a mental link. Focusing on the war's later days, the story follows Raleigh Becket, a washed-up Jaeger pilot called out of retirement and teamed with rookie pilot Mako Mori as part of a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kaiju.|$|E
5|$|The Aleutian Islands played little {{part in the}} {{proceedings}} of World War I, as the events of this war were concentrated in Europe. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed by the United States, the British Empire, the Empire of Japan, the French Third Republic, and the Kingdom of Italy. Article XIX of the Treaty required Japan, Britain and the United States {{to maintain the status}} quo in terms of military fortifications in their respective <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim</b> territories. While Japan and Britain gained a number of exemptions from the terms of Article XIX (for example, Australia and New Zealand were not prevented from building up their fortifications as a result of the Treaty), Japan made it a requirement of their agreement to the Treaty that the Aleutian Islands were not to be exempted.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{released}} as a hardcover on August 25, 2001, published by HarperCollins in Canada, Alfred A. Knopf in the United States, and Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom. Knopf ordered an initial print run of 60,000 copies. It debuted at the #2 sport on the Maclean's fiction bestseller list and peaked at #1 in late September and early October. It was translated {{and published in}} multiple languages, including Japanese and German. The book was {{a finalist for the}} 2001 for the Books in Canada First Novel Award, as well as the Kiriyama Prize, an international literary award for promoting greater understanding of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim</b> and South Asia. It was nominated by the Vancouver Public Library and the Bergen Public Library for the 2003 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} cuisine {{has been}} described as <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim,</b> incorporating the native Māori cuisine and diverse culinary traditions introduced by settlers and immigrants from Europe, Polynesia and Asia. New Zealand yields produce from land and sea—most crops and livestock, such as maize, potatoes and pigs, were gradually introduced by the early European settlers. Distinctive ingredients or dishes include lamb, salmon, kōura (crayfish), dredge oysters, whitebait, pāua (abalone), mussels, scallops, pipis and tuatua (both are types of New Zealand shellfish), kūmara (sweet potato), kiwifruit, tamarillo and pavlova (considered a national dish). A hāngi is a traditional Māori method of cooking food using heated rocks buried in a pit oven. After European colonisation, Māori began cooking with pots and ovens and the hāngi was used less frequently, although it is still used for formal occasions such as tangihanga.|$|E
5|$|Nowadays, large {{quantities}} of goods are transported by sea, especially across the Atlantic and around the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim.</b> A major trade route passes through the Pillars of Hercules, across the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean and through the Straits of Malacca; much trade also passes through the English Channel. Shipping lanes are the routes on the open sea used by cargo vessels, traditionally making use of trade winds and currents. Over 60 percent of the world's container traffic is conveyed on the top twenty trade routes. Increased melting of Arctic ice since 2007 enables ships to travel the Northwest Passage for some weeks in summer, avoiding the longer routes via the Suez Canal or the Panama Canal. Shipping is supplemented by air freight, a more expensive process mostly used for particularly valuable or perishable cargoes. Seaborne trade carries more than US $4 trillion worth of goods each year.|$|E
5|$|The spa {{that was}} {{featured}} in the House since season nine was removed and replaced with exercise bikes that when operated would power a light bulb. The former spa room featured recycled products like wood, plastic and aluminum turned into wallpaper. There was also a shipping container-based bathroom, an open kitchen that paid respects to the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim</b> and a portable garden where the HouseGuests would collect compost and grow their own herb garden {{was added to the}} backyard. The House included four bedrooms each varying in design and comfort. The Head of Household bedroom featured a penthouse design with a waterfall and a faux ocean front view while the first bedroom featured a VIP club lounge design, while the second bedroom resembled the bottom of a public pool and featured a slide and beds that were designed to look like flotation devices. The third room initially used by the HouseGuests was later turned into the Have-Not room, which was a simplistic gray bedroom with metal slabs used as beds.|$|E
5|$|Between its {{participation}} in Desert Storm and the Afghan War, 3rd Battalion conducted multiple deployments around the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rim.</b> In August 1991 the battalion participated in Operation Tafakula in Tonga, an international exercise involving {{elements of the}} French military and the Tongan defense services. In 1992 it conducted a Unit Deployment Program (UDP) to Okinawa. In 1993 India Company participated in Operation Golden Eagle in Australia.
