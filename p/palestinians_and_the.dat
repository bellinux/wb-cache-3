Frequent conflicts have erupted between <b>Palestinians</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Israeli authorities in the city since the 1970s. The tensions led to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza was a center of confrontation during this uprising, and economic conditions in the city worsened.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the Israeli Army {{attempted}} to disperse the {{high concentration of}} Palestinian refugees in al-Shati camp and developed new housing schemes {{that resulted in the}} establishment of the northern Sheikh Radwan district. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and the PLO were vociferous in their opposition to the move, claiming it was forced resettlement. In 1972, Gaza's military governor dismissed the city's mayor, Rashad al-Shawa, for refusing to annex al-Shati camp to the municipality of Gaza. Since the 1970s, frequent conflicts erupted between <b>Palestinians</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Israeli authorities in the city, leading to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza became a center of confrontation during this uprising, and consequently, economic conditions in the city worsened.|$|E

25|$|The Revolt {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} 5,000 <b>Palestinians</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wounding of 10,000. In total 10 percent of the adult male population was killed, wounded, imprisoned, or exiled. The Jewish population had 400 killed; the British 200. Significantly, from 1936 to 1945, whilst establishing collaborative security arrangements with the Jewish Agency, the British confiscated 13,200 firearms from Arabs and 521 weapons from Jews.|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} of Israeli textbooks in 2000 by the Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace (CMIP) {{found that there}} was no indoctrination against the Arabs as a nation, nor a negative presentation of Islam. Islam, Arab culture and the Arabs' contribution to human civilization were presented in a positive light. No book called for violence or war, and many books reportedly expressed the yearning for peace between Israel and the Arab countries. However, some textbooks within the Orthodox Jewish community were found to contain prejudices towards <b>Palestinians</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Arabs were often held responsible for Israel's wars.|$|E

50|$|As {{most of the}} Orthodox Christians in <b>the</b> {{area are}} <b>Palestinian,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> land was in an Arab-populated area that most Palestinians hoped would become {{as a part of}} a future Palestinian capital, these accusations caused a great deal of concern among Church members. On March 19, 2005, the Palestinian Authority formed a {{commission}} to investigate these allegations.|$|R
25|$|At the Arab League {{summit of}} October 1947, in Aley, the Iraqi general, Ismail Safwat, painted a realist {{picture of the}} situation. He {{underlined}} the better organization and greater financial support of the Jewish people {{in comparison to the}} Palestinians. He recommended the immediate deployment of the Arab armies at the Palestinian borders, the dispatching of weapons and ammunition to the <b>Palestinians,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> contribution of a million pounds of financial aid to them. His proposals were rejected, other than the suggestion to send financial support, which was not followed up on. Nonetheless, a techno-military committee was established to coordinate assistance to the Palestinians. Based in Cairo, it was directed by Sawfat, who was supported by Lebanese and Syrian officers and representatives of the Higher Arab Committee. A Transjordian delegate was also appointed, but he did not participate in meetings.|$|E
25|$|Beidas {{was born}} in Nazareth, Palestine in 1874 and studied at the Russian Orthodox al-Muskubīya (presently, {{according}} to Edward Said, a detention and interrogation centre predominantly for <b>Palestinians)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Russian Teachers' Training Centre in Nazareth (now an Israeli police station), which had been founded in that town in 1886. There were no tuition fees for Palestinian students, and though teaching was in Arabic, high importance was placed on studying Russian. In his recollections, Beidas stated that:'In those days, Russian schools in Palestine were, without doubt, the best.' He graduated in 1892. Beidas' education was on a basis of classical Arab culture, and, though a Christian, Beidas achieved renown as a hafiz. In his early twenties, Beidas was appointed headmaster of Russian missionary schools {{in many parts of}} Syria and Palestine. Later, he became the senior Arabic teacher at Anglican-run St. George's School in Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|As {{an example}} of this process, an archaeological tunnel running the length of the western side of the Temple Mount, as it is known to Jews, or the Haram al-Sharif, as it is known to Muslims, became a serious point of contestation in 1996. The tunnel had been in place for about a dozen years, but open {{conflict}} broke out after the government of Benjamin Netanyahu decided to open a new entrance to the tunnel from the Via Dolorosa in the Muslim quarter of the Old City. <b>Palestinians</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Islamic Waqf authorities were outraged that the decision was taken without prior consultation. They claimed that the work threatened the foundations of the compound and those of houses in the Muslim quarter and that it was actually aimed at tunnelling under the holy compound complex to find remains of Solomon's Temple, similar to previous accusations in the 1980s. As a result of the rumor, Arabs rioted in Jerusalem and then spread to the West Bank, leading to the deaths of 86 Palestinians and 15 Israeli soldiers.|$|E

25|$|On August 1 of {{this year}} the 1929 Palestine riots broke out between Palestinians and Jews {{over control of the}} Western Wall. The rioting, {{initiated}} in part when British police tore down a screen the Jews had constructed in front of the Wall, continued {{until the end of the}} month. In total, 133 Jews and 116 Palestinians were killed. Two of the more famous incidents occurring during these riots were the August 23–24 1929 Hebron massacre, in which almost 70 Jews were killed by <b>Palestinians</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> remaining Jews are forced to stay at Hebron. The Palestinians had been told that Jews were killing Palestinians. Jews would not return to Hebron until after the Six-Day War in 1967. The other major clash was the 1929 Safed massacre, in which 18–20 Jews were killed by Palestinians in Safed in similar fashion. Elsewhere in the Middle East, Iraq took a big step toward gaining independence from the British. The Iraqi government had, since the end of World War I and the beginning of the British Mandate in the Middle East, consistently resisted British hegemony. In September, Great Britain announced it would support Iraq's inclusion in the League of Nations, signaling the beginning of the end of their direct control of the region.|$|E
500|$|Jordan is a relatively-small, semi-arid, almost-landlocked {{country with}} a {{population}} numbering 9.5 million. Sunni Islam, practiced by around 92% of the population, is the dominant religion in Jordan. It co-exists with an indigenous Christian minority. Jordan {{is considered to be}} among the [...] safest of Arab countries in the Middle East, and has avoided long-term terrorism and instability. In the midst of surrounding turmoil, it has been greatly hospitable, accepting refugees from almost all surrounding conflicts as early as 1948, with most notably the estimated 2.1 million <b>Palestinians</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 1.4 million Syrian refugees residing in the country. The kingdom is also a refuge to thousands of Iraqi Christians fleeing the Islamic State. While Jordan continues to accept refugees, the recent large influx from Syria placed substantial strain on national resources and infrastructure.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{tensions}} between <b>Palestinians</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Jordanian government increased greatly; heavily armed Palestinian elements {{had created a}} virtual [...] "state within a state" [...] in Jordan, eventually controlling several strategic positions in that country. After their proclaimed victory in the Battle of Karameh, Fatah and other Palestinian militias began taking control of civil life in Jordan. They set up roadblocks, publicly humiliated Jordanian police forces, molested women and levied illegal taxes—all of which Arafat either condoned or ignored. King Hussein considered this a growing threat to his kingdom's sovereignty and security, and attempted to disarm the militias. However, {{in order to avoid}} a military confrontation with opposition forces, Hussein dismissed several of his anti-PLO cabinet officials, including some of his own family members, and invited Arafat to become Prime Minister of Jordan. Arafat refused, citing his belief in the need for a Palestinian state with Palestinian leadership.|$|E
