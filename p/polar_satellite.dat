5|$|PSLV-C37 (also {{known as}} Cartosat-2 series satellite) was the 39th {{mission of the}} Indian <b>Polar</b> <b>Satellite</b> Launch Vehicle (PSLV) program and its 16th mission in the XL configuration. PSLV-C37 {{successfully}} carried and deployed a record 104 satellites in sun-synchronous orbits. Launched on 15 February 2017 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, it broke the earlier record of launching 37 satellites by a Russian Dnepr rocket on 19 June 2014. The cost of the launch was US$15million. According to ISRO, the 101 international satellites were launched {{as part of a}} commercial arrangement between several countries and its commercial arm Antrix Corporation Limited, run {{under the auspices of the}} Indian Government's Department of Space.|$|E

The museum has miniature repicas of ISRO's satellites as well as satellite launch vehicles.

25|$|Under a {{commercial}} Launch Service Agreement between Antrix Corporation Limited (ANTRIX), the commercial arm of ISRO and ASTRIUM SAS, a Company under EADS, France, two advanced Remote Sensing SPOT satellites were successfully launched in 2013 & 2014 on-board ISRO's <b>Polar</b> <b>Satellite</b> Launch Vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is {{contributing}} towards augmenting ESA Galileo satellite navigation system and GPS service in northern Europe by sharing {{data from the}} Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS). ISRO <b>Polar</b> <b>Satellite</b> Launch Vehicle has launched Miniaturized satellites of several European universities and opened payload capacity on Indian CubeSats to European scientific experiments. India relies on Arianespace for the launch of I-3K-class satellites to geosynchronous transfer orbits.|$|E
25|$|ISRO {{has also}} {{launched}} {{a set of}} experimental geostationary satellites known as the GSAT series. Kalpana-1, ISRO's first dedicated meteorological satellite, was launched by the <b>Polar</b> <b>Satellite</b> Launch Vehicle on 12 September 2002. The satellite was originally known as MetSat-1. In February 2003 it was renamed to Kalpana-1 by the Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in memory of Kalpana Chawla – a NASA astronaut of Indian origin who perished in Space Shuttle Columbia.|$|E
40|$|The {{geostationary}} and <b>polar</b> <b>satellites</b> {{comprising the}} current operational system are discussed. The data acquisition capabilities of both satellite types and their complementary functions are reviewed.

40|$|The {{database}} {{created by}} us based on malfunctions {{of more than}} 300 spacecraft differently orbited from 1971 to 1994, which {{formed the basis for}} statistically analyzing the effect of the space on operation of satellites, is described. Data on 49 satellites of the Cosmos series have been included in an analysis for the first time. The database also includes the large set of daily and hourly values of the space weather parameters. A statistical analysis based on more than 6000 malfunctions has made it possible to obtain the quantitative characteristics of the relations between malfunctions and the space weather factors. In particular, very intense solar proton fluxes (with energy > 10 MeV) cause an almost 20 -fold {{increase in the number of}} failures in high polar orbits and much weaker affect geostationary and low polar orbits. Enhanced electron fluxes (> 2 MeV) increase the number of failures on geostationary and low-orbiting <b>polar</b> <b>satellites</b> but almost do not affect high-orbiting <b>polar</b> <b>satellites.</b> Direct and indirect relations between malfunctions and geomagnetic disturbance are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of the gravitomagnetic field is discussed. A never-measured field of nature, the foundations of inertia in Einstein General Relativity, and {{a key role in}} theories of quasars and active galactic nuclei are important aspects of this field and are discussed. In high energy astrophysics, some theories of energy storage, power generation, jet formation and jet alignment of quasars and active galactic nuclei are based on the existence of the gravitomagnetic field of a supermassive black hole (Thorne et al. 1986). LAGEOS 3 is discussed in terms of laser ranged satellites to detect the gravitomagnetic field and supplementary inclination satellites to avoid gravity field uncertainties. Many experiments have been proposed to measure the gravitomagnetic field. The GPB experiment intends to measure the Lense-Thirring-Schiff precession of gyroscopes orbiting the earth. <b>Polar</b> <b>satellites</b> have been proposed to measure the Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital plane (an enormous gyroscope and two guided, drag-free, counter-rotating, <b>polar</b> <b>satellites</b> have been suggested to avoid orbital inclination errors.)

25|$|In 2005, Israel {{decided to}} launch TecSAR, its first {{synthetic}} aperture radar imaging satellite, on India's <b>Polar</b> <b>Satellite</b> Launch Vehicle, or PSLV. TecSAR was chosen to launch through India's PSLV due to Israeli concerns about the reliability and technical limitations of its own Shavit space launch vehicle, economic considerations, and also due to Israel's desire to increase strategic cooperation with India. In 2008, TecSAR was successfully inserted into orbit by India's PSLV. One of TecSAR's primary functions is to monitor Iran's military activities.|$|E

The launch window was {{approximately}} 20 days long and started on 28 October 2013.

25|$|PSLV-C5 was {{the fifth}} {{operational}} launch and overall eighth mission of the <b>Polar</b> <b>Satellite</b> Launch Vehicle program. This launch was also the fifty-second launch by the Indian Space Research Organisation (IRSO) since its first mission on 1 January 1962. The vehicle carried and injected India's remote sensing satellite Resourcesat-1 (also known as IRS-P6) into a sun-synchronous orbit; this was the heaviest and most sophisticated satellite built by IRSO through 2003. PSLV-C5 was launched at 04:52 hours Coordinated Universal Time (10:22 hours Indian Standard Time) on 17 October 2003 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Polar</b> <b>Satellite</b> Launch Vehicle, {{commonly}} {{known by its}} abbreviation PSLV, is an expendable launch system developed by ISRO to allow India to launch its Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites into Sun synchronous orbits. PSLV can also launch small satellites into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). The reliability and versatility of the PSLV is proven {{by the fact that}} it has launched, as of 2014, 71 satellites/spacecraft (31 Indian and 40 foreign) into a variety of orbits. The maximum number of satellites launched by the PSLV in a single launch is 104, in the PSLV-C37 launch on 15 February 2017.|$|E
25|$|ISRO built India's first satellite, Aryabhata, {{which was}} {{launched}} by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1975. It was named after the Mathematician Aryabhata. In 1980, Rohini became the first satellite {{to be placed in}} orbit by an Indian-made launch vehicle, SLV-3. ISRO subsequently developed two other rockets: the <b>Polar</b> <b>Satellite</b> Launch Vehicle (PSLV) for launching satellites into polar orbits and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) for placing satellites into geostationary orbits. These rockets have launched numerous communications satellites and earth observation satellites. Satellite navigation systems like GAGAN and IRNSS have been deployed. In January 2014, ISRO successfully used an indigenous cryogenic engine in a GSLV-D5 launch of the GSAT-14.|$|E
25|$|As {{originally}} conceived, ISRO was {{to launch}} MOM on its Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), {{but as the}} GSLV failed twice in 2010 and ISRO was continuing to sort out issues with its cryogenic engine, it was not advisable {{to wait for the}} new batch of rockets as that would have delayed the MOM project for at least three years. ISRO opted to switch to the less-powerful <b>Polar</b> <b>Satellite</b> Launch Vehicle (PSLV). Since the PSLV was not powerful enough to place MOM on a direct-to-Mars trajectory, the spacecraft was launched into a highly elliptical Earth orbit and used its own thrusters over multiple perigee burns (to take advantage of the Oberth effect) to place itself on a trans-Mars trajectory.|$|E
