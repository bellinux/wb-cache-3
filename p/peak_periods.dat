40|$|Abstract: This paper aims {{to reflect}} the {{severity}} of congestion by the duration of <b>peak</b> <b>period.</b> Two thresholds, the minimum value in the peak hour and 95 percent of peak hour volume respectively, were chosen to define the <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> using archived stop-bar detector data. The thresholds and the time-granularity of the data were cross-compared to choose appropriate threshold and data time interval. Then the measures of duration of <b>peak</b> <b>period,</b> including the length of <b>peak</b> <b>period,</b> the beginning and ending time of <b>peak</b> <b>period,</b> were calculated for different signalized intersections inlet approaches. Further, the measures of <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> of different intersections {{in the same direction}} of the same radial road were presented to find out the commute traffic patterns. Lastly, the spatial-temporal association pattern of the measures of <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> of different intersections in downtown Shanghai was performed by ArcGIS...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the case}} of peak spreading, the {{traditional}} static analysis on the duration of congestion using peak 15 minutes of hour has lost its meaning. To deal with congestion, we need dynamic analysis on the onset and dissipation of congestion. This paper aims to reflect the severity of congestion, even the spatial interaction of congestion, by the relative size of <b>peak</b> <b>period.</b> Two thresholds, the minimum value in the peak hour and 95 percent of peak hour volume respectively, were chosen to define the peak using archived stop-bar detector data. The thresholds and the time-granularity of the data were cross-compared to choose appropriate threshold and data time interval, {{and the result is}} 95 percent of peak hour volume under 10 min interval data. Then the measures of duration of <b>peak</b> <b>period,</b> including the length of <b>peak</b> <b>period,</b> the beginning and ending time of <b>peak</b> <b>period,</b> were calculated for different signalized intersections inlet approaches. Further, the measures of <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> of different intersections in the same direction of the same radial road were presented to find out the commute traffic patterns. Lastly, the spatial-temporal association pattern of the measures of <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> of different intersections in downtown Shanghai was performed by ArcGIS...|$|R

30|$|The {{period of}} {{application}} of inorganic fertilizers should be carefully planned, {{so that it does}} not correspond with the <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> of leaching, which in the area will coincide with the <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> of rainfall (June and July). Thus, fertilizer application must be done at the period of maximum crop uptake.|$|R
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the DR had been extended to Richmond, Ealing Broadway, Hounslow West and Wimbledon in the west and to New Cross Gate in the east. The southern section of the Inner Circle was suffering considerable congestion between South Kensington and Mansion House, between which stations the DR was running an average of 20 trains per hour with more in the <b>peak</b> <b>periods.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the Sci-Fi Dine-In opened {{along with}} {{nineteen}} other new Walt Disney World attractions marking the complex's twentieth anniversary. By the following year, the Sci-Fi Dine-In was serving upwards of 2,200 people daily during <b>peak</b> <b>periods,</b> {{making it the}} park's most popular restaurant. Thai movie theater operator EGV Entertainment opened the EGV Drive-in Cafe in Bangkok in 2003, in a very similar style to the Sci-Fi Dine-In.|$|E
5|$|SeaTac/Airport station {{opened on}} December 19, 2009, {{several months after}} {{the rest of the}} Central Link stations.

5|$|The Seattle–Bremerton route makes six daily round {{trips on}} weekdays, during <b>peak</b> <b>periods,</b> and ten round trips on Saturdays, with no trips on Sundays. The journey takes an {{estimated}} 28 minutes, {{with an additional}} seven minutes for unloading and loading at each terminal. The Kitsap Fast Ferries service uses an online reservation system that is able to book up to 88 of the 118 seats on a given trip, with walk-ons to fill {{the rest of the}} seats.|$|E
5|$|The {{class was}} {{gradually}} superseded on top link expresses during the 1940s by {{growing numbers of}} Bulleid Pacifics, although throughout the 1950s they were frequently called upon during <b>peak</b> <b>periods</b> or to deputise for failures. The rebuilding of the Pacifics in the late 1950s and their subsequent increased reliability rendered the Lord Nelson surplus to operational requirements, and they were gradually phased out of service. The entire class was withdrawn during 1961 and 1962.|$|E
5|$|The {{congestion}} tax {{is being}} introduced at the access and exit ramps of two interchanges on Essingeleden {{in order to}} reduce traffic jams in <b>peak</b> <b>periods,</b> and with shorter traffic jams on Essingeleden, the surrounding roads are expected to have shorter tailbacks. The transport agencies involved expected to reduce traffic on Essingeleden by some 10% in peak hours. One week after the tax began to be charged, traffic on the motorway had decreased by 22% compared to a normal day in mid-December.|$|E
30|$|Primary, {{secondary}} and tertiary roads are significant in predicting <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> vehicular movement. Motorway, {{on the other}} hand, was not so significant in predicting <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> movements when both taxis and private cars were considered together but had a higher significance for private cars in predicting <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> movement when the types of cars were considered separately. Taxis had high usage of tertiary roads during peak hours whereas private cars used primary and secondary roads more during peak hours. The preference for certain road types during peak and off-peak hours is information for traffic engineers to investigate and make choice of all road types attractive to prevent traffic congestion.|$|R

40|$|Building Sector is {{the major}} {{electricity}} consumer and its costly to building owners. Therefore the application of thermal energy storage (TES) has gained popularity to reduce energy cost. Many attractive tariff packages are being offered by the electricity provider to promote TES. The tariff packages offered higher cost of electricity during <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> and lower cost of electricity during off <b>peak</b> <b>period.</b> This paper presented the opportunity to implement a centralized air-conditioning plant integrated with thermal energy storage with partial operation strategies. Building load profile will be calculated hourly according to building specification and building usage trend. TES operation conditions will be designed according to building load demand profile, storage capacity, tariff packages and peak/off <b>peak</b> <b>period.</b> There is an opportunity of energy cost reduction when TES’s chillier is in operation during off <b>peak</b> <b>period.</b> In conclusion, there are opportunities of energy cost reduction by partially operation of centralized airconditioning plant integrated with thermal energy storage...|$|R
5|$|Beacon Hill Station {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1998 and was opened on July 18, 2009, {{as part of}} the inaugural Link line, after five years of tunnel boring and station construction. It consists of a single island platform, divided into two sections by the twin bores of the Beacon Hill Tunnel; four high-speed elevators ferry passengers from the platform to the surface entrance. Trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during <b>peak</b> <b>periods,</b> with less frequent service at other times. Beacon Hill Station is also served by two King County Metro buses that stop at a pair of sheltered bus stops on Beacon Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Capitol Hill {{had been}} {{proposed}} {{as the site}} of a subway stop in unimplemented plans from 1911 and 1968, but voter approval did not come until 1996. It was built as part of the University Link Extension, which began construction in 2009 and opened on March 19, 2016. Construction of the station required the demolition of two city blocks along Broadway, which will be redeveloped into a transit-oriented, mixed-use complex in 2019. Light rail trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during <b>peak</b> <b>periods,</b> with less frequent service at other times. The station is also served by the First Hill Streetcar and several King County Metro bus routes at nearby stops.|$|E

5|$|Statistical ranking systems place Lasker {{high among}} the {{greatest}} players of all time. The book Warriors of the Mind places him sixth, behind Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, Fischer, Mikhail Botvinnik and Capablanca. In his 1978 book The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present, Arpad Elo gave retrospective ratings to players {{based on their}} performance over the best five-year span of their career. He concluded that Lasker was the joint second strongest player of those surveyed (tied with Botvinnik and behind Capablanca).
