5|$|In {{a suburb}} of Bucharest, a 13-year-old boy, Andrei (Gabriel Huian), {{together}} {{with some of his}} friends, watches the prostitutes' show every night from a rooftop and how they are being taken by drivers. The boy falls in love with one of the girls, called Marilena (Mădălina Ghiţescu), and finds out that he needs a decent sum of money in order to approach her. Thus, he steals his father's (Gabriel Spahiu) salary and goes to the prostitutes' meeting place. Marilena's pimp (Andi Vasluianu) is also present, and only agrees to send Marilena and another prostitute with the boy to a nearby pub, where the Rom Elvis is singing (played by the singer Elvis Romano, who translated Elvis Presley's lyrics into his own language). The prostitutes play with Andrei, telling him that he needs a car in order to date them, then they leave. The boy asks Marilena for her <b>phone</b> <b>number,</b> <b>and</b> she writes something in his hand.|$|E

25|$|Rivalry {{between the}} region's three biggest cities {{has led to}} a long-running {{discussion}} about the identity of both the airport, and region, with The East Midlands rarely found on any non-political map of the UK. The name was at one point changed to Nottingham East Midlands Airport so as to include the name of the city that is supposedly most internationally recognisable, mainly due to the Robin Hood legend. However, the airport has a Derby <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> <b>and</b> postcode, and is in Leicestershire, but is officially assigned to Nottingham by IATA. As a result of the dispute, the name change was soon reverted, to now include all city names.|$|E

25|$|In May 2001, Vitter {{authored}} {{an amendment}} to the No Child Left Behind Act, a reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which required all secondary schools receiving federal funding to permit US military recruitment on school grounds and to provide the name, home <b>phone</b> <b>number</b> <b>and</b> address of every student enrolled to military recruiters, unless the student or the student's parent specifically opts out. In February 2007, Democratic Representative Michael M. Honda proposed the Student Privacy Protection Act of 2007 to change Vitter's amendment from requiring high schools to provide military recruiters with students' personal information unless they explicitly opt-out to requiring the student's explicit consent first. According to the Congressional Quarterly, Vitter stands behind the current provision. He stated that if it is changed, families who supported military recruiting may miss out if required to opt in.|$|E

M.I.A. criticized the paper in January 2010 after a travel piece rated post-conflict Sri Lanka the [...] "#1 place to go in 2010".

500|$|In 2006, a primate {{researcher}} at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shut down the experiments in his lab after threats from animal rights activists. The researcher had received a grant to use 30 macaque monkeys for vision experiments; each monkey was anesthetized for a single physiological experiment lasting up to 120 hours, and then euthanized. The researcher's name, <b>phone</b> <b>number,</b> <b>and</b> address were posted on the website of the Primate Freedom Project. Demonstrations were held {{in front of his}} home. A Molotov cocktail was placed on the porch of what was believed to be the home of another UCLA primate researcher; instead, it was accidentally left on the porch of an elderly woman unrelated to the university. The Animal Liberation Front claimed responsibility for the attack. As a result of the campaign, the researcher sent an email to the Primate Freedom Project stating [...] "you win", and [...] "please don't bother my family anymore". In another incident at UCLA in June 2007, the Animal Liberation Brigade placed a bomb under the car of a UCLA children's ophthalmologist who experiments on cats and rhesus monkeys; the bomb had a faulty fuse and did not detonate.|$|E
