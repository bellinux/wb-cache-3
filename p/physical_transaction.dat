40|$|Integration of {{physical}} transactions and financial contracts {{is central to}} successful electricity market design. Virtually every energy transaction has some impact on prices. The mere fact that a <b>physical</b> <b>transaction</b> can affect prices to some degree, and thereby influence the prices of related financial contracts, cannot be a per se definition of price manipulation. A principled policy for characterizing price manipulation in organized electricity markets includes a stand-alone profitability test. Multiple market-clearing prices arise from degenerate pricing conditions that can occur in electricity markets under economic dispatch. In some instances, small changes in bilateral schedules can produce large changes in prices. These prices affect the value of associated financial transmission rights. A stand-alone profitability test distinguishes transactions {{that are consistent with}} workably competitive markets from transactions that serve no economic purpose other than to manipulate prices and profit from other financial contracts. Generalizing this standard to the degenerate conditions that give rise to multiple market-clearing prices provides a principled solution without undermining the market-design foundations that integrate economic dispatch, locational prices and financial transmission rights...|$|E

McGoveran defined <b>physical</b> <b>transactions</b> as the unit of recovery, logical transactions as the unit of consistency, and business transactions as the unit of audit The resulting adaptive transaction model introduces a transaction intrinsic definition of consistency, deferring the decision to combine the results of two or more transactions.

40|$|Most of the {{standard}} economic analyses of the firm utilize only the capital (including the human one) and labor factors, and a term called technology to embrace all the remaining elements. The introduction of the transaction costs (TCs) by Coase (1937) has generated a new stream of complementary theory of the firm as developed mainly by Williamson (1985 etc). Then, a crit ique on TCs has lead to the recognition of other factors such as internal capabilities, information and know-how, routines, strategies, and so on.

This small scale qualitative research used interpretative phenomenological analysis to explore the perspectives on their experience of the impact of the fee transaction of six counsellors in private practice, using semi-structured interviews. Findings suggested that the relationship of the self of the therapist with money played a key part, often leading to a difficulty in reconciling the taking of money with the therapeutic role and this became most apparent in the <b>physical</b> <b>transaction,</b> particularly when it was necessary to ask for money. Participants felt it was important to feel valued, but also that they were providing value for money. The fee represents one of the least well explored elements of the therapeutic alliance.

30|$|An {{early use}} of PIOTs for {{measuring}} the ecological footprint of trade was noted by Hubacek and Giljum (Hubacek and Giljum 2003). PIOTs provide unique insights into the physical structure of the economy (Altimiras-Martin 2014), which differs from the economic structure since monetary input–output tables (MIOTs) record the flows {{of goods and services}} according to their economic values, not their physical mass (Hoekstra and van den Bergh 2006). Thus, PIOTs can also provide insights toward a transparent transition to the circular economy. Recent emphasis on the food–energy–water nexus further highlights the need to integrate physical data with consumption patterns at a subnational level, which PIOTs are uniquely suited to do (Wachs and Singh 2017). Additionally, elemental cycles in the economy using PIOTs (Hoekstra and van den Bergh 2006) are important for studies of dematerialization and movements of critical materials. In this vein, Singh et al. have created a first regional PIOT to demonstrate the nitrogen (N) cycle in the economy of Illinois due to the important role of N in food and energy provision and its significant environmental impacts such as eutrophication (Singh et al. 2017). <b>Physical</b> <b>transaction</b> matrices for sectors with material outputs provide the best basis for future projections (Weisz and Duchin 2006). Furthermore, the incorporation of flows to nature, intrinsic to PIOTs, is key for environmental analysis regarding waste management (Dietzenbacher et al. 2009). Therefore, interest in developing PIOTs has continued (despite the lack of a standardized approach) and multiple PIOTs have been developed using empirical or IO-based approaches as follows.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{that the}} devil is quite a fascinating character to analyse. To emphasis this, I explore the devil in his historical context in literature; in the Bible, Anglo-Saxon literature, English medieval drama and English Renaissance texts. Furthermore, I use three core models of the devil in literature; the Bible, Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus and Milton’s Paradise Lost. After this survey, I focus on my main subject; exploring the characterization of the devil in Romantic literature. To do so, I give a brief survey of the devil in Romantic literature and, here, I also seek to explain the meaning behind his appearance in this period by analysing Blake’s remarkable text The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. In addition, I analyse the characterizations of the devil. This part is divided in several sub chapters; representation of the devil, moment in time, temptation and attraction, the devil’s compact, the devil’s double and {{the woman and the}} devil. To analyse these focus points, I have selected three key texts; Matthew Gregory’s The Monk (1796), Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein or the modern Prometheus (1818) and James Hogg’s The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (1824). After this study, I explain that the devil fulfills many different roles, yet his most significant role is that of antagonist to God and his role as tempter. In Romantic literature, he has a particular interest in faithful human beings. To divert a person from God he uses different methods; language (which {{is one of the most}} important methods), the moment in time is also important and disguising himself as an innocent animal or a good and faithful person or angel. What is more, the devil can only act indirectly and uses a human as his agent, and wants his victims to kill their blood relations. This does not count for the monster in Frankenstein as he symbolizes a devil; he can act directly. And when the devil wants a victim to sell his soul, he needs a <b>physical</b> <b>transaction</b> and I analyse, here, that the devil’s pact mirrors in some way the fall of mankind in the Bible. Apart from this, I explore two deviating readings of the devil in Romantic literature. I show that the devil and his victim are döppelgangers and share ‘instinctual drives’. And, it also seems that the devil still seduces a woman; the victims could be regarded as symbols of femininity, whereas the symbolical devil can be regarded as a female and an Eve figure. In addition, the female figure is also represented as a mad woman. To conclude, throughout time the devil’s characterization develops in English literature; from more the less an abstract meaning to fuller descriptions and physical attributes and, thus, more humanized. The devil is also explored as a figure projecting fears, despair, anxieties, and propaganda and ideologies of society. In English literature, he appears in periods where there is friction between the Catholic Church and England and in revolutionary times...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} a {{systematic}} methodology {{to construct an}} optimized financial transmission rights (FTR) portfolio for the speculator, who purchases FTR holdings {{in order to have}} returns that are as good as possible. The conventional approach of selecting the FTR in a portfolio requires the exhaustive evaluation of all the possible FTR combinations, which in a large-scale network is computationally too demanding a task, particularly when the wide variations in the behavior of the locational marginal price (LMP) differences of nodes over the many hours of the holding period are taken into account. In order to make the speculator's problem more manageable, we recast the problem into a form that allows us to exploit the salient characteristics of power systems, the topological nature of the underlying network and the historical data, so as to gain mathematical insights that we apply to develop the proposed scheme. The speculator returns are collected from the hourly day ahead markets (DAMs) only for those hours that the grid is congested, i. e., the flows on one or more lines are at their maximum limits. Each MW flowing through those lines incurs a transmission usage cost. Unlike a <b>physical</b> <b>transaction</b> from a source node to a sink node that holds FTR in the amount of the flow and receives reimbursement for the transmission usage charges from the independent grid operator (IGO), the speculator who holds FTR for the same node pair simply receives those revenues, because of lack of physical flows. Thus, the identification of congested lines is a key step in the construction methodology. So, rather than focusing on the LMP differences of node pairs to choose FTR, we select node pairs such that the selected congested lines are on their paths from the source nodes to the sink nodes. Conceptually, we specify FTR such that transactions with same node pairs and amounts induce real power flows on the selected congested lines. The strategy of the speculator is to select each congested line and his level of participation on the congested flows on the line. In practice, the speculator cannot do this for all the congested lines, because that would imply the acquisition of too large a number of FTR, whose premiums add to his costs and, thus, lower his returns. Under the assumption that the past behavior continues in the future, he judiciously chooses a subset of lines whose transmission usage costs exceeded the speculator's specified price and time fraction thresholds historically. This subset forms the basis of the optimized FTR portfolio construction. In our proposed scheme, we construct the FTR portfolio with minimum number of node pairs; i. e., we find the minimum number of transactions that induce the desired real power flows on the subset of selected lines. To demonstrate the computational efficiency of the construction algorithm, we select a subset of nodes to specify the FTR node pairs in the portfolio. The manageability of the problem is further aided by focusing on a small number of node pairs. Fewer node pairs improve the manageability. The recasting of the problem in terms of congested lines, rather than LMP differences of node pairs, results in a simplified solution methodology that is amenable to practical implementation. We have extensively tested the proposed methodology on multiple test systems and we discuss representative case study results. The results on three test systems, including the PJM ISO network, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and provide insights into the nature of the problem...|$|E

Real-life <b>physical</b> <b>transactions</b> are generally accomplished using paper ID while electronic transactions are based on password authentication, the most simple and convenient authentication mechanism over insecure networks. In [1], a remote password authentication scheme was proposed by employing a one-way hash function, which was later used for designing the famous S/KEY one-time password system [2]. However, in such schemes, a verification table should be maintained on the remote server in order to validate the legitimacy of the requesting users; if intruders break into the server, they can modify the verification table. Therefore, many password authentication schemes [3 – 7] have recognized this problem, and different solutions have been proposed to avoid verification tables.|$|R

This study {{contributes to the}} research of the adoption of interorganizational exchange governance by developing an augmented constrained-efficiency framework that summarizes the salient factors influencing organizational selection and adoption of electronic exchange governance.

The domestic cause stems from structural and liquidity problems, with growing share of non-performing loans in the financial sector, posing as the most visible manifestation of such problems.

40|$|Abstract. Swing {{options are}} the main type of {{volumetric}} contracts in commodity markets. A swing contract gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to adjust volume of received commodity at her discretion. Unlike paper assets, trading in physical commodities often takes place over time and therefore involves volume as a second key state variable. Often consumption rates of the commodity are unpredictable and make fixed delivery amounts uneconomic. To mitigate such volume risk, a swing contract gives the buyer the opportunity to manage fluctuating commodity demand levels {{in exchange for a}} fixed upfront fee. By exercising her swing up/down rights, the buyer can dynamically match supply and demand levels while hedging her costs. Swing options are widely offered by market makers and used extensively by major energy companies, especially in electricity and fossil fuel markets. Contracts with swing features are available both as stand-alone financial tools, and can also be found embedded within structured <b>physical</b> <b>transactions.</b> 1. Definition and Use.

40|$|The {{study of}} supply chain network {{problems}} through modeling, analysis, and computation {{has been an}} active area of research due {{to the complexity of}} the relationships among the various decision makers, such as suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, as well as the practical importance of the topic for the efficient movement of products. This chapter on supply chain supernetworks with random demands is from a book of essays published in honor of David Boyce for his contributions to the fields of transportation modeling and regional science. In this chapter, the authors introduce a supernetwork supply chain model with random demands. The term supernetwork refers to a network in which decision making regarding transportation and telecommunications tradeoffs (such as those that arise in e-commerce) are modeled in a unified fashion. The authors develop a three-tiered supply chain network equilibrium model consisting of manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. The model allows for <b>physical</b> <b>transactions</b> between the different tiers of decision makers as well as electronic transactions in the form of business-to-business (B 2 B) commerce between manufacturers and the retailers. The model generalized previous supply chain network equilibrium models to include e-commerce, multiple tiers of decision makers, and random demands within the same framework. Finite-dimensional variational inequality theory was used to formulate the derived equilibrium conditions, to study the model qualitatively, and also to obtain convergence results for the proposed algorithmic scheme. Finally, numerical examples were presented to illustrate the model and computational procedure...|$|R
30|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is in proposing a bottom-up approach for constructing PIOTs that combine the strength of process engineering models with the IO framework. This approach is suitable for automation and allows for continuity of datasets at multiple scales to rapidly generate PIOTs. This method can also be integrated with existing approaches to improve process data used in technical coefficients. Since, the method utilizes a detailed technology model, PIOTs created with this method can be updated faster to reflect technology changes in the economy as envisioned by the rectangular choice-of-technology (RCOT) method (Duchin and Levine 2011). Specifically, the proposed method brings the following advantages over the process LCA-based PIOT generation: (1) Process modeling is a transparent methodology where model parameters and unit operations can be seen and adjusted, allowing easy updates and automation; (2) process modeling via the software (Aspen Plus) used here respects the laws of thermodynamics, a challenge in life cycle inventories that needs correction such as via data reconciliation (Yi and Bakshi 2007; Singh et al. 2008; Hau et al. 2008), which is rarely done and (3) process models detail the mechanisms of transformation occurring in each operation of a production system, rather than relying only on empirical documentation for coefficient calculation. Since process model results are used here mainly to generate technical and yield coefficients, this approach can be integrated with comprehensive methodologies such as UPIOM and EXIOBASE, and may allow for improvements in the databases used for calculating <b>physical</b> <b>transactions</b> matrices in existing approaches.|$|R
