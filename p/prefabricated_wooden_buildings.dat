He converted to Wesleyan Methodism in Kapunda around 1845 and later was active in church finance committees and management committee of Prince Alfred College. He was noted for his friendliness to Aboriginals and ex-convicts (notably one Jack Foley, who became a trusted employee to the extent of accompanying Stephen Hack to London in 1840), and as a temperance advocate.

40|$|Problem - Decision makers {{shape the}} {{structure}} of the sales function, but it is unclear how they go about it and why. The rationale for making certain decisions need to be analyzed in order to understand why different decision makers apply different sales strategies. Topic - The Swedish <b>prefabricated</b> <b>wooden</b> house industry consists of many actors with no clear market leader. The sales force seems to mainly consists of external sales agents (manufacturers' representatives, also called reps), though some manufacturers also employ direct sales agents at the manufacturing company. <b>Prefabricated</b> <b>wooden</b> houses corresponded to 86 % of all building permits requested during 2015. Purpose - This thesis aims to explore decision-makers' rationale behind the organization of manufacturers' sales forces in the Swedish <b>prefabricated</b> <b>wooden</b> house industry. Method - Semi-structures interviews with decision makers at manufacturing companies in the Swedish <b>prefabricated</b> <b>wooden</b> house industry have been conducted in order to fulfill the purpose of this study. The empirical findings are then analyzed based on theory that has been collected through partly inductive, partly deductive approaches. Main results - Decision makers use different arguments to justify their strategies. Many different rationale applied translates into no clear pattern besides the one that {{there seems to be no}} clear pattern. Arguments for a rationale decision are given without analytical proof for an assumption. Some interviewees are in essence for an integrated sales force, though might also work with reps...|$|R

Thousands flocked to UF, many bringing spouses and children with them. By 1946, veterans made up nearly two-thirds of the student body. With housing options limited, the university purchased surplus military buildings to serve as a temporary solution. Between 1945 and 1949, three Florida Veterans Villages, or Flavets, were created. The <b>prefabricated</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>buildings</b> provided basic accommodations for each family that included a living room, bedroom, kitchen and bathroom.

40|$|The main aim of {{the thesis}} was focused on hygrothermal {{simulation}} of critical details of two <b>prefabricated</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>buildings</b> - especially connections of the perimeter wall to monolithic foundations, respectively with waterproofing layer. The composition of the external walls of these selected buildings has quite different compositions and thus different potentials of drying integrated moisture from the components. Practical measurement of moisture weight-content {{was applied to the}} wooden bottom plate, which is in direct contact with the concrete slab structures. The influence of different design solutions on hygrothermal characteristics of the wooden plate was examined with regards to the risk of mould growth, analysis of mass loss due to the decay fungi and with the aim to estimate the durability of the studied details of prefabricated wooden houses. The subsequent research focused on the differences in physical and mechanical properties of natural spruce wood (Untreated, (-), A) and impregnated spruce (Treated, (+), B) using supercritical CO 2 and its possible impact on wood protection for mould growth. Samples of identical Untreated and Treated spruce were collected in the laboratory and subjected to thermal and hygrothermal experiments. The comparison of the resulting values of the individual experiments is presented. Required values needed for numerical calculations were obtained from these experiments. In conclusion, the summary of founded comparison is presented. The mould growth analysis and its influence on the durability of wooden structures offer a view of the behaviour of the structures. Relevant findings and recommendations for the future praxis are mentioned...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} few years the use of {{lightweight}} <b>buildings</b> made of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>wooden</b> elements has become more common. Ease of installation, high accuracy and lightness of such buildings has attracted builders and designers. Sweden, having a large coverage of renewable forests has an increasing interest in multi-storey <b>wooden</b> <b>buildings.</b> However noise and vibration in <b>wooden</b> <b>buildings</b> is an issue of concern especially low frequency impact sound due to footsteps. Impact sound insulation of floors can be measured based on ISO 140 - 7 using standardized tapping machine as excitation source. Experience has shown that in many cases the results obtained by this method do not correlate with annoyance experienced by inhabitants. On the other hand, the method presented in ISO 140 - 7 has usually shown to be relevant for the evaluation of impact sound transmission of concrete floors. Discovering the source of this contradiction requires deeper understanding of the impact process. A first step would be to find the difference between contact forces of the tapping machine on different floor materials. One could then correlate it with inhabitants’ perceived annoyance. This paper is the first step of this investigation which is a part of a Swedish research project called AkuLite. In this work a time-dependent model based on Hertz’s contact law is presented for the tapping machine. The model is validated by measurements on a homogeneous concrete floor. Also the contribution of parameters such as damping and stiffness of floor material on the resulting impact force and vibrations is studied...|$|R
