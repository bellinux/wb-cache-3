5|$|Careful {{measurement}} of {{the positions of the}} planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational perturbations, and an ability to determine <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>future</b> positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as celestial mechanics.

5|$|In the {{folklore}} of Croats of Ravni Kotari, {{a region}} in northern Dalmatia, there were men called vidogoja. They {{were believed to}} know <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>future</b> things.

The vidogoja were also thought to be able to inflict diseases on people, and to have evil eyes. They could not fly.|$|E

5|$|The {{notion of}} {{temporal}} finitism {{was inspired by}} the doctrine of creation shared by the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Christian philosopher, John Philoponus, presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>future.</b> Philoponus' arguments against an infinite past were used by the early Muslim philosopher, Al-Kindi (Alkindus); the Jewish philosopher, Saadia Gaon (Saadia ben Joseph); and the Muslim theologian, Al-Ghazali (Algazel).|$|E

5|$|Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 is a {{provision}} of the Human Rights Act 1998 that enables the Act to take effect in the United Kingdom.

This interpretation goes far beyond normal statutory interpretation, and includes <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>future</b> legislation, therefore preventing the Human Rights act from being impliedly repealed by subsequent contradictory legislation.|$|E

5|$|The {{compilation}} was one {{of several}} ideas Rare considered to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Inspired by fans, upcoming Xbox One backward compatibility features, and a desire to link Rare's <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>future,</b> the company sorted through 120 games to choose titles that best represented its oeuvre. It prioritized games with characters and environments original to the company. Rare incorporated six hardware emulators in the package, and worked with its parent company, Microsoft, to use its unannounced Xbox 360 emulation. Rare Replay released worldwide as an Xbox One exclusive on August 4, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Eliot invokes {{images of}} {{original}} sin and Adam's fall when talking about the past and points out that such events can be forgotten but can still affect mankind. Eliot brings {{in the image of}} Krishna to discuss how the <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>future</b> are related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come at any time and that men should always find the divine will instead of worrying about what their actions will bring. If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} the past as a foreign country has become a {{standard}} trope in contextual approaches {{to the study of}} history, emphasizing specificity, particularity and contingency. Considering the relationship not simply between <b>past</b> <b>and</b> present, but <b>past,</b> present <b>and</b> <b>future</b> obviously adds a further dimension to the problem. If the past is a foreign country, what about the future? This question is addressed first by examining the notion of incommensurability. I shall demonstrate that contextualist approaches, at least in the more radical versions, posit an essential incommensurability between <b>past</b> <b>and</b> present that has quite profound implications for both normative theory and methodology – and indeed for the relationship between norms and methods in the pursuit of social scientific knowledge about <b>past,</b> present <b>and</b> <b>future.</b> The second part of the paper considers the matter of responsibility and/or accountability for the <b>past,</b> present <b>and</b> <b>future.</b> More generally I shall argue a case for the commensurability of <b>past,</b> present <b>and</b> <b>future</b> as methodologically more coherent and certainly more tenable in normative terms. Finally, I consider certain policy implications with particular reference to aspects of responsibility and accountability borne by any present generation for both the <b>past</b> <b>and</b> the <b>future.</b> 20 page(s...|$|R

5|$|No gamma-ray {{burst from}} {{within our own}} galaxy, the Milky Way, has been observed, and the {{question}} of whether one has ever occurred remains unresolved. In light of evolving understanding of gamma-ray bursts and their progenitors, the scientific literature records a growing number of local, <b>past,</b> <b>and</b> <b>future</b> GRB candidates. Long duration GRBs are related to superluminous supernovae, or hypernovae, and most luminous blue variables (LBVs), and rapidly spinning Wolf–Rayet stars are believed to end their life cycles in core-collapse supernovae with an associated long-duration GRB. Knowledge of GRBs, however, is from metal-poor galaxies of former epochs of the universe's evolution, and it is impossible to directly extrapolate to encompass more evolved galaxies and stellar environments with a higher metallicity, such as the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The Church of the SubGenius' {{ostensible}} beliefs defy categorization or {{a simple}} narrative, often striking outside observers as bizarre and convoluted. The group {{has developed an}} intricate mythology involving gods, aliens, and mutants, which is usually considered by observers to satirize other religions. Their primary deity, generally known as Jehovah1, is cast as an extraterrestrial, who contacted Dobbs in the 1950s. Various accounts state that the encounter occurred while Dobbs was building a television or watching late-night television. Jehovah1 gave him supernatural knowledge of the <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>future,</b> in addition to incredible power. Dobbs then posed deep questions to the alien, receiving mysterious answers. Some of their discussion centered on a powerful conspiracy, to which the Church attributes command of the world.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the state {{government}} conducted a feasibility study for a second floating bridge across Lake Washington, in response to increased traffic on the bridge. In 1953, the Washington State Legislature approved {{the construction of a}} second floating bridge, using <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>future</b> tolls to fund its construction. The west end of the floating bridge would be connected to the Everett–Seattle tollway (later Interstate 5) at Roanoke Street, south of the planned Ship Canal Bridge, as well as the proposed Empire Way Expressway at Montlake. The east end would be connected to a north–south freeway bypass of the Seattle area, which later became Interstate 405. Two alignments for the floating bridge were considered in the late 1950s: a Sand Point–Kirkland, favored by the City of Seattle; and an Evergreen Point crossing, favored by {{the state government}} and the U.S. Navy, which operated Naval Air Station Sand Point. The state government initially chose the Montlake–Evergreen Point alignment in 1954, intending to begin construction in 1955, but the alignment dispute delayed a final decision until December 1956. Citizen groups from the Montlake area protested the decision, but were largely ignored by the project's citizen committee.|$|E

5|$|On August 13, 2015, {{as part of}} {{a five-year}} {{programming}} and development deal, Sesame Workshop announced that first-run episodes of Sesame Street would move to premium television service HBO (which had not aired any original children's programming since 2005) in late 2015. Sesame Workshop sought the deal because of declining revenue from viewer donations, and decreases in distribution fees paid by PBS member stations and licensing for merchandise sales (particularly through Sesame Workshop's dependence upon revenue from DVD sales), with the intent to having the show remain on PBS in some fashion (HBO already had involvement in public television {{at the time of the}} deal, providing funding for the talk show Charlie Rose); the deal also came in the wake of changing viewer habits of American children over the previous ten years. HBO will hold first-run rights to all newer episodes of the series starting with season 46, after which they will air on PBS member stations following a nine-month exclusivity window, with no charge to the stations for airing the content; however, HBO has not announced whether first-run episodes will air on the pay service's main channel or its multiplex channel HBO Family. The agreement also gives HBO exclusive rights to stream <b>past</b> <b>and</b> <b>future</b> Sesame Street episodes on HBO Go and HBO Now – assuming those rights from Amazon Video and Netflix. On August 14, Sesame Workshop announced that it would phase out its in-house subscription streaming service, Sesame Go, as a standalone service; instead of shutting it down entirely, it intends to scale back its offerings to either provide access to a reduced slate of free content or act as a portal for Sesame Streets website.|$|E
