5|$|Although the MSS was {{the most}} useful {{instrument}} on Landsat 2, sometimes the data recorded was anomalous. The U.S. Geological Service (USGS) would identify these anomalies and document them. Known issues on the MSS are: banding, coherent noise, data loss, impulse noise, oversaturation, scan correlated shift (SCS), scan mirror pulse, and transmission striping. Transmission striping occurred when data from an individual sensor was lost. Most commonly, multiple data losses occurred simultaneously, resulting in an image with colored bands on it. This form of data anomaly could not be corrected in <b>post</b> <b>processing.</b>|$|E

40|$|The major {{economic}} activity of Arumeru district community is agriculture, production of fruits {{is one of}} the agricultural activities. They grow different types of fruits but a big percent of the fruits is consumed and sold fresh to the Arusha municipal market and the remaining percent perishes. The farmers are facing a number of challenges, including lack of technologies and equipment to process the fruits for a better market. Generally a big portion of these fruits get rotten during the harvesting season which leads to significantly huge post harvest losses. This research aims at assessing factors for enhanced <b>post</b> harvest <b>processing</b> of fruits to add value and increase shelf life in Arumeru district. The research used descriptive research design and quantitative research method in its whole process. Data were collected through survey and reviews of various secondary sources. The findings of this study concluded that • Indeed most of the farmers have not made any significant efforts on <b>post</b> harvesting <b>processing</b> of the fruits to add value and increase shelf life. • Most of the farmers have no knowledge on <b>post</b> harvest <b>processing</b> technologies for their fruits. • Government and other stakeholders have given no significant assistance to the farmers on <b>post</b> harvest <b>processing</b> From these findings, several recommendations have been made most of them emphasize on Government and stakeholders intervention to enforce appropriate policies and programmes to improve <b>post</b> harvesting <b>processing</b> climate...|$|R

Many LCD monitors do post-processing before displaying the image {{in an attempt to}} compensate for poor color fidelity, which adds an additional lag. Further, a video scaler must be used when displaying non-native resolutions, which adds yet more time lag.

Dapensi Trio Usaha that are positioned in <b>Post</b> Office Mail <b>Processing</b> Centre Yogyakarta. It has background that {{the rapid growth}} of development also gave influence to the development of workers sectors that leaded to the emergence of outsourcing to the workers by purpose to depress company's expenses by the shape of workers expenses in order to increase its production. The implementation of outsourcing is not tended to assist the workers. It clearly seems from the lack of health maintaining insurance either for the workers or their families. <b>Post</b> Office Mail <b>Processing</b> Centre Yogyakarta is one of the companies using outsourcing workers. However in its implementation, outsourcing is conducted in companies' primary activities. From this background, the author took problem formulations as follow: 1. Why <b>Post</b> Office Mail <b>Processing</b> Centre Yogyakarta deploys outsourcing workers for conducting primary activities of <b>Post</b> Office Mail <b>Processing</b> Centre Yogyakarta? 2. Why the providing of work health maintaining insurance to outsourcing workers in PT. Dapensi Trio Usaha that is positioned in <b>Post</b> Office Mail <b>Processing</b> Centre Yogyakarta is not appropriate to the determination on prevailing health maintaining insurance? From the result of this research, <b>Post</b> Office Mail <b>Processing</b> Centre Yogyakarta deploys outsourcing workers in its primary activities by reason of lack amount of workers that conduct primary activities of <b>Post</b> Office Mail <b>Processing</b> Centre Yogyakarta and also the existence of company's policy that will not recruit the workers in this current time, thus the implementation of outsourcing in <b>Post</b> Office Mail <b>Processing</b> Centre Yogyakarta has violated to the Article 65 paragraph 2 and Article 66 paragraph 1 of the Laws Number 13 of 2003. The implementation of health maintaining insurance to the outsourcing workers in <b>Post</b> Office Mail <b>Processing</b> Centre Yogyakarta is not appropriate to the determination of Article 16 of the Laws Number 3 of 1992 by reason of any factors of PT.
