6000|$|These considerations, both {{negative}} and <b>positive,</b> <b>lead</b> {{us to the}} final conclusion that the History published in 1758 is practically the History referred to in Swift's Correspondence, and therefore the authentic work of Swift himself. We say practically, {{because there are some}} differences between it and the text published here. The differences have been recorded from a comparison between Lucas's version and the transcript of a manuscript discovered in Dublin in 1857, and made by Mr. Percy Fitzgerald. Mr. Fitzgerald found that this manuscript contained many corrections in Swift's own handwriting. At the time he came across it the manuscript was in the possession of two old ladies named Greene, grand-daughters of Mrs. Whiteway, and grand-nieces of Swift himself.

50|$|A {{hot point}} probe {{is a method}} of {{determining}} quickly whether a semiconductor sample is n (negative) type or p (positive) type. A voltmeter or ammeter {{is attached to the}} sample, and a heat source, such as a soldering iron, is placed on one of the leads. The heat source will cause charge carriers (electrons in an n-type, electron holes in a p-type) {{to move away from the}} lead. The heat from the probe creates an increased number of higher energy carriers which then diffuse away from the contact point. This will cause a current/voltage difference. For example, if the heat source is placed on the <b>positive</b> <b>lead</b> of a voltmeter attached to an n-type semiconductor, a positive voltage reading will result as the area around the heat source/positive lead becomes positively charged.|$|E
50|$|LED sets {{also have}} special bases that enforce {{electrical}} polarity, {{and keep them}} from being used in incandescent sets. Philips-branded sets and most store brands use an offset, with the longer anode (<b>positive</b> <b>lead)</b> being lower and the shorter cathode (negative lead) being higher on the wedge base. GE-branded sets (no longer actually made by GE) use a larger round base with a tab that sticks out to one side. A small resistor may also be contained {{in the base of}} older two-volt LED colors (red, orange, yellow) when in a mixed-color set, so that they match the three volts needed by the newer colors (blue, deep green, purple, white), however other manufacturers only change the value of the resistor that {{is a part of the}} cord set itself.|$|E

40|$|Feelings-as-information theory {{states that}} {{feelings}} inform {{us about the}} nature of our current situation and we rely on them to make our judgments. Beyond that, feelings tune our cognitive processes to meet situational requirements. Positive feelings result in relying on pre-existing knowledge structures and default strategies, whereas negative feelings hamper relying on routines and results in adapting systematic processing. Based on this premise, it was hypothesized that positive mood, elicited either by the perceived target or by the independent source, would lead to relying on accessible agentic or communal content in perceiving strangers, as well as familiar others, whereas negative mood would weaken these tendencies. Specifically, the three studies showed initial evidence that (a) <b>positive</b> mood <b>leads</b> to focusing on agencyrelated qualities in perception of unknown men {{to a greater extent than}} negative mood, (b) <b>positive</b> mood <b>leads</b> to focusing on communion-related qualities in perception of unknown women more than negative mood, and(c) <b>positive</b> mood <b>leads</b> to relying on communal content in perception of familiar others comparing to negative mood...|$|R
