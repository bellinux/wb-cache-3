The perception of the patient about the progress of treatment was scored with “Likert scale”. The mean (±SD) score of patient’s perception following completion of treatment were 1. 27 ± 1. 26 (using 15 % propylene glycol), 2. 88 ± 1. 26 (30 % propylene glycol), and 3. 75 ± 1. 06 (45 % propylene glycol) respectively.
