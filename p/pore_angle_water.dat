In all cases ion beam etching resulted in flat smooth surfaces. Etching rate of the “conventional ” DLC films synthesized from acetylene and DLC films deposited from hexamethyldisiloxane vapor and acetylene gas mixture was 44 nm/min and 29 nm/min respectively.

40|$|Macroporous silicon {{has been}} widely {{utilized}} in many electronic and optoelectronic applications. However, it is quite difficult to prepare macroporous silicon with large aperture on p-type low-resistivity c-Si substrate by the conventional fabrication methods, such as reactive ion etching (RIE), electrochemical etching (ECE), and metal-catalyzed electroless etching (MCEE). Such work was realized here by metal–catalyzed electrochemical etching (MCECE). Firstly, Ag nanoparticle catalyst was fabricated on the c-Si substrate by immersing the substrate into a mixed aqueous solution of HF and AgNO 3. Electrochemical etching was then performed in a HF-H 2 O 2 solution. The synergetic effect of Ag catalyst and the external applied electric field successfully facilitated the formation of large-aperture macroporous silicon. By adjusting the specific MCECE conditions, macroporous silicon with the pore aperture large up to several micrometers was successfully obtained on p-type c-Si substrate with the low resistivity of about 0. 1 – 3 ohm · cm. Especially, the <b>pore</b> tip <b>angle</b> could be controlled flexibly from 3. 5 ◦ to 41 ◦.

30|$|Contact {{angle is}} one of the {{important}} indicators to measure the wettability of a surface or material.

40|$|International audienceThe {{geometry}} of voids in porous rock falls between two end-members: very low aspect ratio (the {{ratio of the}} minor to the major axis) microcracks and perfectly spherical pores with an aspect ratio of unity. Although {{the effect of these}} end-member geometries on the mechanical behaviour of porous rock has received considerable attention, our understanding of the influence of voids with an intermediate aspect ratio is much less robust. Here we perform two-dimensional numerical simulations (Rock Failure Process Analysis, RFPA 2 D) to better understand the influence of pore aspect ratio (from 0. 2 to 1. 0) and the <b>angle</b> between the <b>pore</b> major axis and the applied stress (from 0 to 90 °) on the mechanical behaviour of porous rock under uniaxial compression. Our numerical simulations show that, for a fixed aspect ratio (0. 5) the uniaxial compressive strength and Young's modulus of porous rock can be reduced by a factor of ~ 2. 4 and ~ 1. 3, respectively, as the angle between the major axis of the elliptical pores and the applied stress is rotated from 0 to 90 °. The influence of pore aspect ratio on strength and Young's modulus depends on the <b>pore</b> <b>angle.</b> At low angles (~ 0 - 10 °) an increase in aspect ratio reduces the strength and Young's modulus. At higher angles (~ 40 - 90 °), however, strength and Young's modulus increase as aspect ratio is increased. At intermediate angles (~ 20 - 30 °), strength and Young's modulus first increase and then decrease as pore aspect ratio approaches unity. These simulations also highlight that the influence of <b>pore</b> <b>angle</b> on compressive strength and Young's modulus decreases as the pore aspect ratio approaches unity. We find that the analytical solution for the stress concentration around a single elliptical pore, and its contribution to elasticity, are in excellent qualitative agreement with our numerical simulations. The results of our numerical modelling are also in agreement with recent experimental data for porous basalt, but fail to capture the strength anisotropy observed in experiments on sandstone. We conclude that the alignment of grains or platy minerals such as clays exerts a greater influence on strength anisotropy in porous sandstones than pore geometry. Finally, we show that the strength anisotropy that arises as a result of preferentially aligned elliptical pores is of a similar magnitude to that generated by bedding in porous sandstones and foliation in low-porosity metamorphic rocks. The modelling presented herein shows that porous rocks containing elliptical pores can display a strength and stiffness anisotropy, with implications for the preservation and destruction of porosity and permeability, as well as the distribution of stress and strain within the Earth's crust...|$|R
