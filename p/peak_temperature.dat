This was the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of solar system objects. While the impacts {{took place on the}} side of Jupiter hidden from Earth, Galileo, then at a distance of 1.6AU from the planet, was able to see the impacts as they occurred. Its instruments detected a fireball that reached a <b>peak</b> <b>temperature</b> of about 24,000K, compared to the typical Jovian cloudtop temperature of about 130K (−143°C), with the plume from the fireball reaching a height of over 3,000km.|$|E

30|$|Onset and <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{are defined}} based on heat flow data {{as opposed to}} evolved gas data because DSC is a more widely used thermal {{analysis}} technique due to its versatility (DSC can measure phase changes, specific heats, etc.).

The particles with higher <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> were believed to have velocities of ≥ 18  km/s, and those with lower temperature have ≤ 14  km/s. The differences in atmospheric entry velocities are considered to result from differences in their parent bodies, i.e., particles with higher velocities are from comets and those with lower velocities are from asteroids.|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{profiles}} {{in the lead}} smelter sinter bed at Xstrata Zinc Mount Isa sinter plant have been measured using a wireless temperature probe. Corresponding sinter samples have been collected for characterisation. The sinter <b>peak</b> bed <b>temperatures</b> {{were found to be}} in the range of 1000 - 1200 °C. Microstructures and softening temperatures of these sinters have been characterised. Strong correlations have been observed between <b>peak</b> bed <b>temperature</b> and <b>peak</b> hood <b>temperature,</b> and between mean sinter softening <b>temperature</b> and <b>peak</b> bed <b>temperature.</b> It was found that higher <b>peak</b> bed <b>temperature</b> results in higher sinter softening temperature. For the feed material used in the trials, to obtain sinters with mean softening temperatures above 1050 °C, <b>peak</b> bed <b>temperatures</b> above 1130 °C are required.

40|$|International audienceInverted {{metamorphic}} sequences {{correspond to}} the stacking of structural units through which the metamorphicpeak temperatures progressively increase upwards. Such thermal profiles, already studied for years, are characteristicof lithospheric-scale thrust zones. Nevertheless, the processes allowing their formation still remaincontentious. Several processes can, indeed, lead to <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> inversion: heat advection, shear heating, indepthaccretion and/or erosion (allowing the exhumation of the overthrusting block). Furthermore, heat diffusionalso has an important effect on temperatures distribution {{on both sides of}} the thrust. Each one of these processesdistinctly impacts on the metamorphic thermal field in the vicinity of the thrust zone. However, their respectiveinfluences were never clearly analyzed and compared despite their crucial importance for the interpretation of theinverted <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> signatures. Here, we thus propose to address this shortcoming by using two-dimensional numerical models simulatingintra-continental thrusts systems. To do so, we combine a parametric numerical study and the “analytical characterization”of the computed inverted <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> recorded, in our models, along profiles perpendicularto the thrust zone. The parametric combinations, including kinematic setting (i. e. convergence, erosion andaccretion), thermal properties, mechanical strength and heat sources, control the processes into play during thethrust activity whose relative importances can be quantified. When the resulting <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> profiles presenta noticeable inversion, they are converted into a function of approximation characterized by six parameters. Thesesix outputs then constitute the keys to quantitatively decipher the inversions features, not only in terms of spatialextent and intensity over time, but also by characterizing the <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> trends on either sides of thedomain of inversion. This numerical and analytical coupled approach then allows to give the significance of peaktemperatures profiles in relation with the different processes into play. Our results allow to quantify the influence of each process (i. e. heat diffusion, heat advection, shear heating,erosion and accretion) on the different features of inverted <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> signatures. They show that noneof them can be considered alone. Finally, the function of approximation used in this study, allowing to efficientlyfit a discrete dataset to a continuous signal, can also be applied to natural <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> estimations followingthe same way. We thus propose to illustrate this on the example of the inverted metamorphic sequence associatedto the Main Central Thrust zone in the Himalayas...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{simulation}} model {{that aims to}} evaluate the effect of thermal management on battery life. The model consists of two submodels: a thermal model and a battery degradation model. The temperature rise in the battery is calculated using the thermal model, and a temperature profile is obtained under pre-defined driving, charging and stand-by scenarios. The temperature profile and the energy requirement required to achieve a driving profile act as inputs to the degradation sub-model, {{which is used to}} predict the battery life. The degradation model is derived from models and test data available in literature, and the model is constructed for aircooled cylindrical LiFePO 4 cells based on the Hymotion Prius-conversion configuration. Preliminary results suggest that <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> have the greatest impact on degradation: Thermal management increases life substantially in climates with high <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> (Pheonix) and for more aggressive driving cycles (US 06), while thermal management has less influence in climates with lower <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> (Miami) and with gentle driving cycles (UDDS).

The spores were heated to <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> up to 300 degrees C over 30 s under vacuum conditions (10 (- 3) mbar). There was no effect on spore viability until <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> reached 180 - 200 degrees C (12 - 15 s of heat exposure). Spore viability then fell rapidly with increasing <b>temperature.</b> Once <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> exceeded 300 degrees C, no further spore viability was detected. The average heating rate was rapid (10 degrees C s(- 1)); thus spores were exposed to <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> for less than a second. These data inform on the process of determining bioburden reduction and control steps necessary for external surfaces of spacecraft which are non-sterile at launch, as well as providing new information about the ability of a model resistant organism to survive rapid, short-duration heating.

30|$|Based on {{the noble}} gas release {{profiles}} (Fig.  1), the moderately and severely heated MMs should have experienced atmospheric heating with <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> > 650  °C because the cumulative releases of 4 He in the 400 and 650  °C fractions are {{much lower than}} 50  %. It is difficult to estimate the <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> for each MM. If {{it is assumed that}} the moderately heated MMs have initially contained 4 He at the maximum (saturated) concentration of 10 − 1 – 10 − 2  cm 3 STP SW- 4 He/g in particles ~ 50  μm in diameter (e.g., Bogard 1977; Jull and Pillinger 1977; Signer et al. 1977), the present 4 He concentrations correspond to 10 − 1 – 10 − 3 of the initial concentrations (Table  2). According to the results of stepped extraction experiments, most of noble gases are extracted below ~ 900  °C from lunar soil (Nier and Schlutter 1992; Fu et al. 2013) and synthetic olivine irradiated by 4 He with 50 -keV kinetic energy (Fu et al. 2013). Hence, the <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> for the moderately heated MMs are likely between 650 and 900  °C. For the severely heated MMs, the observed concentrations of 4 He are 10 to 100 times lower than those for the moderately heated MMs and correspond to 10 − 2 – 10 − 5 of the hypothetical initial concentrations.

The <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> reported by Lavalette and Pope [1] of 63 – 68  °C are considerably higher than the temperatures recorded under similar conditions. These differences might, in part, be a result of the different experimental designs used. Ganaway and Hunter [12] used an experimental setup very similar to our own. Their results are much more consistent with the temperatures we have reported. As mentioned previously, we performed five casts on a volunteer’s forearm under the same conditions as in Trial 2. The <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> did not vary by more than ± 1.0  °C between these trials.
