5|$|U-43 was due {{to depart}} Lorient on a war patrol to an area off Freetown, west Africa, but early on 4 February 1941, she sank while tied to Ysere, an old sailing ship which {{was used as a}} {{floating}} pier. Valves and vents had been tampered-with the previous day, but no one had noticed the slow, but steady ingress of water into the bilges. To make matters worse and contrary to a Befehlshaber der U-Boote (BdU—U-boat command headquarters) directive, a hatch had been left open, allowing water to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> after torpedo room. Two petty officers were found to be most at fault; but Lüth, as captain, was ultimately responsible. However, according to author Jordan Vause, no record of punishment seems to have survived and Lüth's career {{does not appear to have}} been affected. U-43 was refloated and Lüth took it back out into the North Atlantic in May 1941.|$|E
25|$|Father Edward Sorin, now the superior-general of the Congregation of Holy Cross, {{had left}} {{on a trip to}} Europe two days prior to the fire. He {{immediately}} returned to campus after the fire to find much of his school in ruins. He vowed to the students and faculty to rebuild the school in time for the fall semester. Condolences started to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> school immediately, many of them published in subsequent issues of the student weekly magazine Scholastic.|$|E
25|$|The gifts {{continued}} to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> church: {{at the end}} of the 17th century, King Pedro II, offered a silver crown in the name of the House of Braganza; during the 18th century, King John V donated religious equipment to the chapel; Father Manuel Rodrigues, who died in Castro Daire, left behind 6$000 réis in the 18th century; between 1720 and 1730, votive paintings were completed in the altar of the sacristy; and, in October 1752, António da Fonseca Osório donate eight pieces of coin, equal to 1$500 réis each.|$|E

She {{seems to have had}} an about-face and tells Poirot that Andersen is a great man and that she cannot betray him. She rushes out of the shop and Poirot sees that a surly-looking man has been {{listening}} into their conversation. The next service is proceeding and Miss Carnaby is about to be injected again when Mr Cole steps in. There is a fight and the police <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room. Mr Cole is in fact Detective Inspector Cole and he arrests Andersen.|$|E
25|$|In 1980 {{half of all}} the {{industrial}} jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City. Under relentless growth, the Mexico City government could barely keep up with services. Villagers from the countryside who continued to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles. This caused serious air pollution in Mexico City and water pollution problems, as well as subsidence due to overextraction of groundwater. Air and water pollution has been contained and improved in several areas due to government programs, the renovation of vehicles and the modernization of public transportation.|$|E
25|$|Explosive {{growth in}} the {{population}} of the city started from the 1960s, with the population overflowing the boundaries of the Federal District into neighboring state of Mexico, especially to the north, northwest and northeast. Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to 8,831,079. Under relentless growth, Mexico City had lost its charm by the 1970s, when the government could barely keep up with services. Mexico City was choking in smog and pollution. Villagers from the countryside who continued to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles.|$|E

25|$|The fate of Galicia {{was settled}} by the Peace of Riga on March 18, 1921, {{attributing}} Galicia to the Second Polish Republic. Although never accepted as legitimate by some Ukrainians, it was internationally recognized with significant French support on May 15, 1923. The French support for Polish rule of ethnically Ukrainian eastern Galicia and its oil {{resources in the}} Borysław-Drohobycz basin were rewarded by Warsaw allowing significant French investment to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Polish oil industry. The Poles had convinced the French that since less than 25% of the ethnic Ukrainians were literate before the Great War and Ukrainians were novices in governing themselves, only the Poles, not the Ukrainians, {{would be able to}} administer eastern Galicia and its precious oil assests.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, {{while in}} {{hospital}} {{for the removal of}} her tonsils, Svetlana met Kunwar Brajesh Singh, an Indian Communist from the Kalakankar Rajput Zamindar family visiting Moscow. The two fell in love. Singh was mild-mannered and highly educated but gravely ill with bronchiectasis and emphysema. The relationship grew deeper and stronger still while the couple were recuperating in Sochi beside the Black Sea. Singh returned to Moscow in 1965 to work as a translator, but he and Svetlana were not allowed to marry. The following year, 1966, he died. She was allowed to travel to India to take his ashes to his family to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Ganges. She stayed in the family home in Kalakankar {{on the banks of the}} Ganges for three months and became immersed in local customs, leading to her abandonment of atheism. In an interview on 26 April 1967, she referred to Singh as her husband but also stated that they were never allowed to marry officially.|$|E
25|$|The city of Asheville {{is home to}} a Duke Energy Progress {{coal power}} plant near Lake Julian. This power plant is {{designated}} as having Coal Combustion Residue Surface Impoundments with a High Hazard Potential by the EPA. In 2012 a Duke University study found high levels of arsenic and other toxins in North Carolina lakes and rivers downstream from the Asheville power plants coal ash ponds. Samples collected from coal ash waste flowing from the ponds at the Duke Energy Progress plant to the French Broad River in Buncombe County contained arsenic levels more than four times higher than the EPA drinking water standard, and levels of selenium 17 times higher than the agency's standard for aquatic life. In March 2013 the State of North Carolina sued Duke Energy Progress in order to address similar environmental compliance issues. In July 2013 Duke Energy Corp. and North Carolina environmental regulators proposed a settlement in the lawsuit that stated coal ash threatened Asheville's water supply. The settlement called for Duke to assess the sources and extent of contamination at the Riverbend power plant in Asheville. Duke would be fined $99,100 if the settlement is approved. Following the coal ash spill in Eden, NC resulting in 82,000 tons of coal ash leaking into the Dan River, the North Carolina DENR cancelled all previous settlements with Duke Energy. Duke said a stormwater drainage pipe under the utility's Dan River Steam Station lagoon ruptured Feb 2, allowing ash slurry to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> river. Duke Energy faces future legislation by Tom Apodaca, republican NCGA Senate leader forcing them to clean up their south Asheville coal ash ponds. Tom Apodaca expects the legislation will be filed as soon as the General Assembly returns to session in May 2014. Apodaca expects the ponds will be cleaned up in 5–10 years under his law.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, other crewmen {{fought to}} {{maintain}} vital services as water continued to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ship below decks. The engineers and firemen worked to vent steam from the boilers {{to prevent them}} from exploding on contact with the cold water. They re-opened watertight doors in order to set up extra portable pumps in the forward compartments in a futile bid to reduce the torrent, and kept the electrical generators running to maintain lights and power throughout the ship. Steward F. Dent Ray narrowly avoided being swept away when a wooden wall between his quarters and the third-class accommodation on E deck collapsed, leaving him waist-deep in water. Two engineers, Herbert Harvey and Jonathan Shepherd (who had just broken his left leg after falling into a manhole minutes earlier), died in boiler room No.5 when, at around 00:45, the bunker door separating it from the flooded No.6 boiler room collapsed and they were swept away by [...] "a wave of green foam" [...] according to leading fireman Frederick Barrett, who barely escaped from the boiler room.|$|E
500|$|As September {{passed into}} October {{it became clear}} that Clinton was not coming to help Burgoyne, who put the army on short rations on October 3. The next day, Burgoyne called a war council in which several options were discussed, but no {{conclusive}} decisions were made. When the council resumed the next day, Riedesel proposed retreat, in which he was supported by Fraser. Burgoyne refused to consider it, insisting that retreat would be disgraceful. They finally agreed to conduct an assault on the American left flank with two thousand men, {{more than one-third of the}} army, on October 7. [...] The army he was attacking, however, had grown in the interval. [...] In addition to the return of Lincoln's detachment, militiamen and supplies continued to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> American camp, including critical increases in ammunition, which had been severely depleted in the first battle. The army Burgoyne faced on October 7 was more than 12,000 men strong and was led by a man who knew how much trouble Burgoyne was in. Gates had received consistent intelligence from the stream of deserters leaving the British lines and had also intercepted Clinton's response to Burgoyne's plea for help.|$|E
500|$|On 30 September {{the ship}} {{sustained}} what Shackleton described as [...] "the worst squeeze we had experienced". Worsley described the pressure as like being [...] "thrown {{to and fro}} like a shuttlecock a dozen times". On 24 October, the starboard side was forced against a large floe, increasing the pressure until the hull began to bend and splinter, so that water from below the ice began to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ship. When the timbers broke they made noises which sailors later described as being similar {{to the sound of}} [...] "heavy fireworks and the blasting of guns". The supplies and three lifeboats were transferred to the ice, while the crew attempted to shore up the boat's hull and pump out the incoming sea, but after a few days, on 27 October 1915, and in freezing temperatures below −15°F (−25°C), Shackleton gave the order to abandon ship. The position at abandonment was [...] 69°05′S, 51°30′W. [...] The wreckage remained afloat, and over the following weeks the crew salvaged further supplies and materials, including Hurley's photographs and cameras that had initially been left behind. From around 550plates Hurley chose the best 150, the maximum that could be carried, and smashed the rest.|$|E

500|$|Mexican {{soldiers}} withdrew and regrouped, {{but their}} second attack was repulsed. Fifteen {{minutes into the}} battle, they attacked a third time. During the third strike, Romero's column, aiming for the east wall, was exposed to cannon fire and shifted to the north, mingling with the second column. Cos' column, under fire from Texians on the west wall, also veered north. When Santa Anna saw {{that the bulk of}} his army was massed against the north wall, he feared a rout; [...] "panicked", he sent the reserves into the same area. The Mexican soldiers closest to the north wall realized that the makeshift wall contained many gaps and toeholds. One of the first to scale the 12-foot (3.7 m) wall was General Juan Amador; at his challenge, his men began swarming up the wall. Amador opened the postern in the north wall, allowing Mexican soldiers to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> complex. Others climbed through gun ports in the west wall, which had few defenders. As the Texian defenders abandoned the north wall and the northern end of the west wall, Texian gunners {{at the south end of}} the mission turned their cannon towards the north and fired into the advancing Mexican soldiers. This left the south end of the mission unprotected; within minutes Mexican soldiers had climbed the walls and killed the gunners, gaining control of the Alamo's 18-pounder cannon. By this time Romero's men had taken the east wall of the compound and were pouring in through the cattle pen.|$|E

2500|$|At {{approximately}} 8:18 am, Enterprise {{was turning}} to port to conduct flight operations when a Zuni rocket, {{equipped with a}} 15-pound warhead of Composition B explosive, mounted on a F-4J Phantom parked on the stern, exploded after being heated by the exhaust from an MD-3A [...] "Huffer", a tractor-mounted air starting unit used to start aircraft. The explosion perforated the aircraft's fuel cells, and ignited the leaking JP-5 jet fuel. About a minute later, three additional Zuni rockets exploded; these blasts blew holes into the flight deck, allowing the burning JP-5 to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 03 level directly under the flight deck. Captain Kent Lee, commanding officer of the Enterprise, directed the port turn to continue after the first explosion, steering the ship into the wind to blow smoke away from the ship.|$|E
2500|$|Construction {{began on}} April 16, 1930 and {{immediately}} faced serious engineering and geotechnical obstacles related to natural ground water and drainage. [...] The stadium {{was built in}} a shallow ravine, with the lower thirty-two rows of the east, west, and north stands {{below the level of}} the surrounding land. When excavation reached the water table, water began to <b>pour</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> construction site from the north end, miring men, mules, and mule-drawn equipment in the resulting mud. [...] The drainage challenge was ultimately resolved by the installation of massive underground culverts leading to Graham Pond, two blocks south of the stadium site. [...] Problems solved, the construction team of eighty laborers and mules completed Florida Field in time for the November 8, 1930 homecoming game against Alabama, the dominant Southern Conference team of the day. Florida Field was rededicated in 1934 to the memory of Florida servicemen who died in World War I, and a plaque was placed on the outside wall behind the old north end zone as a memorial.|$|E
