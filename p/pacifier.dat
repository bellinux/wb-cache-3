5|$|Groening {{thought that}} it would be funny to have a baby {{character}} that did not talk and never grew up, but was scripted to show any emotions that the scene required. Maggie's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk, and a penchant for sucking on her <b>pacifier,</b> the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her <b>pacifier</b> over other characters' dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.|$|E
5|$|Though {{she rarely}} talks, she {{frequently}} makes a characteristic sucking noise with her <b>pacifier,</b> {{which has become}} synonymous with the character. Her <b>pacifier</b> sucking noises are provided by the show's creator, Matt Groening and early producer Gabor Csupo. Maggie's occasional speaking parts and other vocalisations are currently provided by Nancy Cartwright, but she has also been voiced by guest stars James Earl Jones, Elizabeth Taylor and Jodie Foster, and by series regulars Yeardley Smith and Harry Shearer. Maggie has appeared in various media relating to The Simpsons– including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books– and has inspired an entire line of merchandise.|$|E
5|$|During {{the earlier}} seasons of the show, Maggie's {{equivalent}} of a hallmark was to trip over her clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor, but this was toned down in the later seasons. She has penchant for her <b>pacifier,</b> on which she is always seen sucking.|$|E
40|$|Results: the {{analyzed}} <b>pacifiers</b> met the Brazilian standards (100 %). <b>Pacifiers</b> {{were infected}} {{by the three}} groups of microorganisms studied (> 15 %), with higher prevalence (p 0. 05). Conclusion: the morphological conditions and contamination of <b>pacifiers</b> did not vary between the types of nursery schools, verifying that the necessary hygiene and care to the management of these <b>pacifiers</b> were inadequate despite the suitability to Brazilian standards. Sschool and dentists have an important hole in modifying this condition. Introduction: the use of <b>pacifiers</b> can cause risks to children health, resulting in opportunistic infections and accidents. Objective: our paper intends to evaluate the structural and microbiological conditions of children <b>pacifiers</b> at public and private nursery schools, {{in the city of}} Imperatriz, Maranhão, Brazil. Methods: thirty children <b>pacifiers</b> from public (n = 15) and private (n = 15) nursery schools, were evaluated considering their adequacy to Brazilian standards such as presence of dirt, and presence of infectivity by mutans streptococci group, Candida sp. and Enterococcus sp. The care provided for the use of <b>pacifiers</b> was asked to the parents and caregivers through a questionnaire...|$|R
25|$|In October 2009, the German {{environmental}} organization Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland requested {{a ban on}} BPA for children's products, especially <b>pacifiers,</b> and products that make contact with food.

30|$|Functional/orthodontic <b>pacifiers</b> {{reduce the}} {{prevalence}} of open bite {{when compared to the}} conventional ones, but evidence is needed concerning the effects on posterior crossbite. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to further analyze the effects of functional/orthodontic and conventional <b>pacifiers</b> on orofacial structures.|$|R
5|$|Maggie is the {{youngest}} child of Homer and Marge, and sister to Bart and Lisa. She is often seen sucking on her red <b>pacifier</b> and, when she walks, she trips over her clothing and falls on her face (this running gag is used much more in earlier seasons). Being an infant, she cannot talk. She is a counterpart to Lisa Simpson. However, she did appear to talk in the first Tracey Ullman Show short.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Maggie causes distractions when Marge {{brings her}} to rehearsal, so Llewellyn tells Marge to enroll the baby at the daycare center, The Ayn Rand School for Tots, which {{is run by}} his sister Ms. Sinclair, who {{immediately}} confiscates Maggie's <b>pacifier.</b> Maggie and the other babies later engage {{in an attempt to}} retrieve their pacifiers, but Ms. Sinclair thwarts their efforts and sends Maggie to a playpen.|$|E
5|$|Marge discovers Maggie's {{first baby}} tooth, {{which appears to}} be a sharp fang. Maggie later loses her legs and grows green tentacles. Maggie's <b>pacifier</b> sucks contact the alien duo, Kang and Kodos. They arrive at the Simpson house, coming to {{retrieve}} Maggie. Marge reveals that Kang is Maggie's real father and explains how it happened. Kang and Kodos demand that the Simpsons give Maggie to them, and Kang and Homer start to fight until they are taken on The Jerry Springer Show. When an audience member criticizes Kang, he vaporizes her, as well {{as the rest of the}} audience and the film crew. After leaving the studio, Kang and Kodos threaten to destroy every politician in Washington unless given Maggie. Marge and the Simpsons slyly imply that the aliens could not possibly destroy every politician, and they fly off to do so.|$|E

30|$|Our {{assessment}} is {{in accordance with}} the findings of Dogramaci and Rossi-Fedele [8], despite the fact that we focused only on the effect of <b>pacifiers</b> and not on non-nutritive sucking habits in general. They concluded that the use of <b>pacifiers</b> in the deciduous dentition is cause of malocclusions [8]. Our review, although with moderate and serious overall risk of bias, shows that the use of <b>pacifiers</b> seems to be associated with anterior open bite [12 – 15, 23 – 26, 30, 31] and posterior crossbite [10, 12, 15, 23 – 25, 28 – 30].|$|R
30|$|Taking into {{consideration}} the present evidence, it seems that <b>pacifiers</b> with thin neck induce less open bite than the conventional ones. Functional/orthodontic <b>pacifiers</b> investigated in the literature seem not to reduce the occurrence of posterior crossbite. New nipple shape and texture are needed to counteract the narrowing of the palate.|$|R
5|$|The lactational {{amenorrhea}} method {{involves the}} use of a woman's natural postpartum infertility which occurs after delivery and may be extended by breastfeeding. This usually requires the presence of no periods, exclusively breastfeeding the infant, and a child younger than six months. The World Health Organization states that if breastfeeding is the infant's only source of nutrition, the failure rate is 2% in the six months following delivery. Six uncontrolled studies of lactational amenorrhea method users found failure rates at 6 months postpartum between 0% and 7.5%. Failure rates increase to 4–7% at one year and 13% at two years. Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing, the use of a <b>pacifier,</b> and feeding solids all increase its failure rate. In those who are exclusively breastfeeding, about 10% begin having periods before three months and 20% before six months. In those who are not breastfeeding, fertility may return four weeks after delivery.|$|E
5|$|The {{next step}} is to apply hair. The hair can either be done in one of two ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting hair is added 1-4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand. This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once the hair is finished, the {{original}} vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the head like one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a <b>pacifier</b> or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s {{researchers}} dispelled {{the notion that}} <b>pacifiers</b> were psychologically unhealthy and aberrant. Richard H. Passman and Jane S. Halonen at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee traced the developmental course of attachments to <b>pacifiers</b> and provided norms. They found that 66% of their sample of babies who were three months old in the United States demonstrated at least some attachment, according to their mothers. At six months of age, this incidence was 40%, and at nine months it was 44%. Thereafter, the rate of attachment to <b>pacifiers</b> dropped precipitously until, at 24 months of age and later, it was quite rare.|$|R

25|$|Language {{development}} and processing begins before birth. Evidence {{has shown that}} there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud {{during the last few}} weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while sucking on a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The <b>pacifier</b> used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the <b>pacifier</b> was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able to recognize what they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in the last six weeks of pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|A pecker or penis gag is a gag {{that has}} a bulge {{resembling}} a phallus (erect penis) or a nipple that is placed into the mouth to enable the wearer to suck on it {{in a manner similar}} to an adult <b>pacifier.</b> The use of a phallic shape is intended to give it an erotic connotation, but it may be a large knob— similar to a ball gag— or may be inflatable. The pecker gag may be wide and flat and large enough almost to fill the mouth, intended to depress the tongue.|$|E
