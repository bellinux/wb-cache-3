5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a <b>physician</b> <b>who</b> was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E

Family physicians provide a relatively high proportion of care to pregnant women on Medicaid, especially in rural areas.

Of surveyed <b>physicians</b> <b>who</b> limited the number of their Medicaid obstetric patients, 58 % stated that recent Medicaid policy changes had increased their willingness to accept new Medicaid obstetric patients. Despite these policy changes, administrative issues and poor reimbursement were cited as the two most notable barriers to providing obstetric care to women on Medicaid.
