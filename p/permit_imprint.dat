50|$|Beginning in August 2007, the Postal Service began {{requiring}} mailers shipping Parcel Select packages using a <b>permit</b> <b>imprint</b> to use eVS for manifesting their packages.|$|E
5000|$|Postage Payment: All mailpieces {{must include}} {{appropriate}} valid postage. Postage payment {{may be in}} the form of stamps, stamped stationery, precanceled stamps, postage meter imprints & PC Postage products ("Postage Evidencing Systems"), or <b>permit</b> <b>imprint</b> (indicia). Members of the U.S. Congress, among others, have franking privileges, which require only a signature.|$|E
5000|$|Franking {{refers to}} any devices, markings, or {{combinations}} thereof ("franks") applied to mails of any class which qualifies {{them to be}} postally serviced. Types of franks include uncanceled and precanceled postage stamps (both adhesive and printed on postal stationery), impressions applied via postage meter (via so-called [...] "postage evidencing systems"), official use [...] "Penalty" [...] franks, Business Reply Mail (BRM), and other <b>permit</b> <b>Imprints</b> (Indicia), manuscript and facsimile [...] "franking privilege" [...] signatures, [...] "soldier's mail" [...] markings, and any other forms authorized by the 191 postal administrations that {{are members of the}} Universal Postal Union.|$|R
5000|$|As of June 2007, the USPS has {{a printed}} matter {{classification}} known as [...] "Bound Printed Matter", BPM, defined as, advertising, promotional, directory, or editorial {{material that is}} securely bound and at least 90% is imprinted by a process other than handwriting or typewriting and is only available for user with an <b>imprint</b> <b>permit.</b>|$|R
500|$|Dr. Mark Griffiths of Nottingham Trent University {{described}} Lara Croft as {{a psychological}} tabula rasa. Richard Rouse of Midway Games attributed the character's {{appeal to a}} loosely defined personality, which <b>permits</b> players to <b>imprint</b> their own onto her. Jeremy Smith stated that the minimal personality allows players to form {{a relationship with the}} character. Burton added that Croft is perceived differently around the world. French demographics focus on her sex appeal, while German and British audiences are drawn to her aggressiveness and aloofness, respectively. Fansites dedicated to Lara Croft appeared on the internet in several languages after the release of Tomb Raider, and contained official and fan-created images of Croft, model photographs, and fan fiction starring the character. More than 100 such sites were present by the end of 1998. By 2000, search engine HotBot yielded around 4,700pages for a search of the character's name. Admirers discussed rumours related to Lara Croft via usenet newsgroups and ICQ chats. Enthusiasts also collected merchandise and paraphernalia, submitted fan art to video game magazines, participated in Croft cosplay, and obtained tattoos depicting the character. One admirer rode a bike over [...] from Amsterdam to Derby wearing Lara Croft brand clothing to meet the developers, who welcomed him after learning of the trip.|$|R
40|$|Autochthonous Triassic sediments of the Vieux Emosson Formation near Lac d’Emosson, southwestern Switzerland, {{have yielded}} assemblages with {{abundant}} archosaur footprints that {{are assigned to}} chirotheriids based on pentadactyl pes and manus imprints with characteristic digit proportions. Tridactyl footprints formerly considered as those of dinosaurs are identified as incomplete extramorphological variants of chirotheriids. Recently discovered new sites, including a surface with about 1500 <b>imprints,</b> <b>permit</b> re-evaluation of ichnotaxonomy and modes of preservation. Most common are oval to circular impressions arranged in an ‘‘hourglass-like’’ shape, corresponding to pes-manus couples. Sediment displacement rims indicate the presence of true tracks rather than undertracks. A few well-preserved footprints with distinct digit traces allow closer assignments. Several chirotheriid ichnotaxa are present with Chirotherium barthii,?Chirotherium sickleri, Isochirotherium herculis, Chirotheriidae cf. Isochirotherium isp. and indeterminate forms. This corresponds with characteristic assemblages from the Buntsandstein of the Germanic Basin. In the study area, the Vieux Emosson Formation is an up to 10 m thick finingupward sequence with conglomerates, rippled sandstones, siltstones and mudstones and occasionally carbonate nodules. Sedimentological features such as high relief erosion, immature sediments, erosionally truncated metre-scale fining-upward sequences, palaeosols and unidirectional palaeocurrents clearly prove a fluvial depositional environment with sediment transport towards the northwest and the Germanic Basin. This contrasts with former assumptions of a coastal marine environment and a south-facing transport towards the Tethys. The footprints occur in the coarser lower portion of the sequence that is interpreted as a shallow braided river. From Obersand in the eastern Swiss Alps, a surface in dolomitic limestone (Ro¨ti Dolomite) is re-examined. The footprints are identified as Chirotherium barthii and were impressed in a carbonate tidal flat environment. Biostratigraphically, the occurrence of characteristic Buntsandstein assemblages with Chirotherium barthii supports an Anisian age of both locations...|$|R
