5|$|After the war, Raymond's <b>practice</b> <b>with</b> Tuttle, Seelye and Place was dissolved.

5|$|Before {{his first}} <b>practice</b> <b>with</b> Al-Nasr, Owumi became nauseated from food {{poisoning}} and was hospitalized. He {{moved into a}} luxurious apartment {{in the center of}} Benghazi owned by Mutassim Gaddafi. Initially unaware, he later saw pictures of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his family across the building and learned that Al-Nasr was owned by the Gaddafi family. Owumi began playing with Al-Nasr during a three-game losing streak, and his Libyan teammates had bruises and scratches, as they were beaten by security during such slumps. The team received millions of dollars in funding from the Gaddafi family and its home arena had been the site of Gaddafi's first public execution.|$|E

5|$|Dennis's lack {{of concern}} was vindicated on Saturday, with Hamilton setting the fastest time in <b>practice</b> <b>with</b> a lap of 1:34.811.

Kubica, Räikkönen, Rosberg and Heidfeld followed, with Super Aguri driver Anthony Davidson eighth fastest. Super Aguri are regarded as a sister team to the Honda F1 works team, who set only the 17th and 19th fastest times. The 2007 Super Aguri is widely thought to be an updated version of Honda's 2006 car.|$|E
