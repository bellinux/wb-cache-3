In three experiments, we examined the consequences of taking a multiple-choice (MC) pretest on the later recall of both pretested and non-pretested related information, finding that pretesting improved recall of pretested information without impairing recall of nonpretested information. In addition, we compared a <b>pretest</b> <b>condition</b> to conditions in which subjects were told to memorize the questions and in which subjects studied facts prior to reading. Although taking a pretest was not significantly more effective than memorizing questions or studying facts for the pre-exposed information, it did not impair the learning of related information, whereas studying facts did.

Therefore, new media have gained respect and raised high expectations, due to their obvious advantages. Hence, {{the aim of this}} study was to develop a standardised instrument, which allows for valid assessment of parameters relevant for the evaluation of computer-based learning (CBL). The main emphasis was placed on the overall acceptance of CBL as well as on some pertinent characteristics of individual learners. We took this as an example to systematically describe the construction of a questionnaire, focussing on the methodological and scientific aspects of this multi-step process. A first version, which was constructed on theoretical grounds, was analysed and revised using standard <b>pretest</b> <b>conditions</b> (n= 18). The second revision was done using a cognitive pretest-technique, called "Think-Aloud" (n= 10). After this qualitative evaluation, the questionnaire was offered to a representative sample of n= 328 third-year medical students. In this quantitative analysis, 12 valid psychometric scales could be confirmed by factor analysis. Reliability analysis yielded satisfying values (a= 0. 71 - 0. 91) in 10 cases: 5 scales on learner properties, 2 scales on learning strategies, one scale on the attitude towards CBL and 2 scales on expectations regarding CBL.

For this analysis, time {{served as the}} within-subjects factor while treatment group (i. e., static and signaling, dynamic and signaling, static without signaling, and dynamic without signaling) served as the between-subject independent variable. Three dependent variables {{were used to assess}} learner outcomes: (a) a 14 multiple-choice pre and post-test to measure knowledge retention, (b) a pre and post-test concept map to measure synthesis and structure of knowledge, and (c) four questions based on a Likert scale asking students to rank the cognitive difficulty of understanding four aspects of the animation they engaged in. A mental rotations test was used in the <b>pretest</b> <b>conditions</b> to establish a control and used as a covariate. The treatment contained a four minute and 53 second animation that served as an introductory multimedia presentation explaining the gravitational effects of the moon and sun on the earth.

40|$|Low {{back pain}} (LBP) is a common, {{widespread}} {{social and economic}} problem. Degenerative disc disease has been considered as a main risk factor for the LBP. In order to develop safe, effective and cost-efficient treatments, {{it is important to}} explore the pathomechanisms of this disease. In vivo animal models have an irreplaceable role in detecting long-term reactions to environmental factors, biology or biomechanical risk factors, and preclinical evaluation of therapeutics. Large animal models, due to their similarity in cellular populations, anatomy and biomechanics, are more closely comparable to the human intervertebral disc than smaller animal models. The major goal of current thesis was characterizing the effect of short and long term immobilization on the magnetic resonance imaging, radiological, histological and biomechanical characteristics of the in vivo ovine lumbar spine joints. To achieve this target, four experimental projects were performed. In the first experimental portion, a three-dimension motion capture system was set up and validated. A reliable method of the spinal kinematic analysis was established. The second experimental portion evaluated the biomechanical aspect of a synthetic biomimetic spine model with a validated spinal biomechanical test system combined with the motion capture system set up in the first study. This established the whole system applicability to the specific goal of examining spinal biomechanics. The third experimental chapter is an in vitro ovine biomechanical study. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize the effect of loading and soaking conditions on the spinal segment biomechanical property. Results indicated the biomechanics of spinal samples with hydration and dehydration discs differ considerably. Thus, the suitable <b>pretest</b> <b>conditions</b> need to be considered during in vitro spinal biomechanical test. The fourth experimental portion was the in vivo ovine model study.

Significant {{differences were found}} in resulting potency values between laboratories. Factors that may have influenced results, such as age, stage, and strain of larvae used, amount and type of food provided to larvae, and processing of samples were examined. Use of different rearing temperatures, different strains of #Aedes aegypti$ L., or late 3 rd instars vs. the recommended early 4 th instars did not explain the inconsistencies. The slope of the dose-response curve of the IPS- 82 powder was influenced by particle size, which varied with the nature and duration of sample homogenization. Laboratories using low-intensity processing obtained a greater slope in the dose-response curve for the flowable product than for the powder standard. The type and quantity of food provided to larvae affected susceptibility. Larvae fed an excess of protein-rich food became 4 th instars in 3 days and were less susceptible to B. t. i. than those fed smaller quantities of carbohydrate-rich food that became 4 th instars in 5 - 7 days.

The statistical population of the study included all mothers who had a female student with Oppositional defiant disorder (age group 6 to 12 years) of primary school in Nour Abad, Iran. Sampling was conducted in two stages, random and purposive. For this purpose, 34 mothers of girls with Oppositional defiant disorder after purposive sampling were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups (17 in each of groups). The Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher Report Form (TRF) with clinical interviews were used for screening. Also, the anxiety and depression inventory and aggression questionnaire were used to collect data in two <b>conditions</b> (<b>pretest</b> and posttest). Mindful parenting course was implemented for the experimental group in 8 sessions, 2 hours each. Data were analyzed using SPSS software (ver. 23), descriptive statistical parameters (mean and SD) and univariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results: Results of ANCOVA indicated that the Mindful Parenting course directed to a statistically significant difference between pre-and post-test scores which led to decreasing scores of anxiety, depression and aggression.

Self-concept was operationally defined as scores on a slightly modified version of Marsh 2 ̆ 7 s Self-Description Questionnaire (Marsh, 1988). A quasi-experimental, nonequivalent control group design was used to compare the self-report self-concept of two groups of upper elementary students (N = 337). The treatment group (n = 171) received instruction in fractions via the teacher-directed, videodisc-based, Mastering Fractions program (Systems Impact, 1986 a). The control group (n = 166) received their normal grade four or grade five mathematics program, but did not include common fractions. Differences in achievement scores provided support for previous findings regarding the Mastering Fractions program. The treatment group covariance-adjusted mean on a criterion-referenced test was higher than that of the control (5. 9 standard deviations). Differences in achievement test scores among the treatment classes varied directly with the levels of program implementation across classes.

Using the student as the unit of analysis, the treatment group mathematics self-concept covariance-adjusted mean was 0. 22 standard deviations above that of the control group. An analysis of raw gain scores yielded a standardized mean difference effect size between the treatment and control group scores of +. 12. A statistically significant but small main effect was also noted across student pretest achievement levels. The posttest difference between low-achiever means treatment versus control students is slightly larger than the difference between high-achiever means. No statistically significant interaction was noted between student achievement level at <b>pretest</b> and treatment <b>condition.</b> The class was also used as the unit of analysis. In this case the mean difference effect sizes between experimental groups were + 0. 86 (ANCOVA) and + 0. 34 (raw gain scores). Differences were small to moderate, but consistent with the study hypotheses. Recommendations are presented regarding future research and the use of direct instruction in school settings.

In line with this, there is increasing emphasis {{on the need to}} keep people both active and participating in daily life. Consequently, it is essential that well developed and validated instruments that can meaningfully assess levels of participation and activity are widely available. Current measures, however, are largely focused on disability and rehabilitation, and there is no measure of activity or participation for generic use that fully meets the standards set by regulatory bodies such as the US Food and Drug Administration. Here we detail a protocol for the development and validation of a new patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for assessment of participation and activity in people experiencing a variety of health conditions, ie, the Oxford Participation and Activities Questionnaire (Ox-PAQ). The stages incorporated in its development are entirely in line with current regulations and represent best practice in the development of PROMs. METHODS: Development of the Ox-PAQ is theoretically grounded in the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. The project incorporates a new strategy of engaging with stakeholders from the outset in an attempt to identify those characteristics of PROMs considered most important to a range of potential users. Items will be generated through interviews with patients from a range of <b>conditions.</b> <b>Pretesting</b> of the instrument will be via cognitive interviews and focus groups. A postal survey will be conducted, with data subject to factor and Rasch analysis in order to identify appropriate dimensions and redundant items. Reliability will be assessed by Cronbach's alpha and item-total correlations. A second, large-scale postal survey will follow, with the Ox-PAQ being administered in conjunction with generic measures of health status to further test the validity of the measure. The Ox-PAQ will again be administered at 2 weeks to assess test-retest reliability and at 3 months to assess responsiveness. CONCLUSION: The development of the Ox-PAQ is a timely one. With increasing emphasis being placed on the importance of keeping people active and participating in daily life, the instrument has the potential for significant uptake. Its primary use is intended to be in clinical trials and for evaluation of interventions targeted at maintaining activity and participation...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} integrity of hard, erosion-resistant coatings were tested using the Structural Dynamics Laboratory at the NASA Glenn Research Center. Under {{the guidance of}} Structural Mechanics and Dynamics Branch personnel, fixturing and test procedures were developed at Glenn to simulate engine vibratory conditions on coated polymer-matrix- composite bypass vanes using a slip table in the Structural Dynamics Laboratory. Results from the high-frequency mechanical bench testing, along with concurrent erosion testing of coupons and vanes, provided sufficient confidence to engine-endurance test similarly coated vane segments. The knowledge gained from this program will {{be applied to the}} development of oxidation- and erosion-resistant coatings for polymer matrix composite blades and vanes in future advanced turbine engines. Fan bypass vanes from the AE 3007 (Rolls Royce America, Indianapolis, IN) gas turbine engine were coated by Engelhard (Windsor, CT) with compliant bond coatings and hard ceramic coatings. The coatings were developed collaboratively by Glenn and Allison Advanced Development Corporation (AADC) /Rolls Royce America through research sponsored by the High-Temperature Engine Materials Technology Project (HITEMP) and the Higher Operating Temperature Propulsion Components (HOTPC) project. High-cycle fatigue was performed through high-frequency vibratory testing on a shaker table. Vane resonant frequency modes were surveyed from 50 to 3000 Hz at input loads from 1 g to 55 g on both uncoated production vanes and vanes with the erosion-resistant coating. Vanes were instrumented with both lightweight accelerometers and strain gauges to establish resonance, mode shape, and strain amplitudes. Two high-frequency dwell conditions were chosen to excite two strain levels: one approaching the vane's maximum allowable design strain and another near the expected maximum strain during engine operation. Six specimens were tested per dwell <b>condition.</b> <b>Pretest</b> and posttest inspections were performed optically at up to 60 magnification and using a fluorescent-dye penetrant. Accumulation of 10 million cycles at a strain amplitude of two to three times that expected in the engine (approximately 670 Hz and 20 g) {{led to the development of}} multiple cracks in the coating that were only detectable using fluorescent-dye penetrant inspection. Cracks were prevalent on the trailing edge and on the convex side of the midsection. No cracking or spalling was evident using standard optical inspection at up to 60 magnification. Further inspection may reveal whether these fine cracks penetrated the coating or were strictly on the surface. The dwell condition that simulated actual engine conditions produced no obvious surface flaws even after up to 80 million cycles had been accumulated at strain amplitudes produced at approximately 1500 Hz and 45 g...|$|R

The currently accepted position concerning recommended lighting for visually impaired individuals is that individually identified and specified lighting is required for these persons to attain optimal visual performance. However, there is presently no formula for predicting the placement or intensity of a light source needed for any given patient, nor are there any specific rules for determining optimal illumination for visually impaired individuals. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine (a) if individual levels of optimal illumination could be reliably determined for visually impaired adults, (b) if variance existed in the levels identified, and (c) if the level identified in assessment had validity in relation to a practical reading task. Visual response accuracy was assessed across 10 levels of illumination which were all greater than normal room lighting. Each level was presented 4 times for a total of 40 experimental trials. Subjects read five letters aloud per trial. The accuracy of their response, the time elapsed during responding, and their perception of comfort was noted for each trial and summed across each level. Optimal illumination was defined as that level at which 100 % correct responding occurred in the least amount of total time elapsed. Selection of optimal illumination was limited only to those levels perceived as comfortable by the respondent. Results indicate that optimal visual responding, and therefore, optimal illumination levels, was identified for 93 % of the sample. Illumination levels identified as optimal ranged from 1 to 10 (65 fc to 1, 500 fc) with 9 of the 10 levels being identified as optimal at least once. The median was 4. 0 (195 fc), and the mode was 1. 0 (65 fc). Reliability was determined in three ways: (a) interobserver reliability, (b) test-retest reliability, and (c) split-half reliability. The various correlation coefficients obtained between (a) observers, and (b) test-retest situations indicated that the measure was reliabile at or beyond the 0. 001 level of significance in all cases. Split-half reliability measures were obtained to determine the internal consistency of each of the three dependent variables used in the assessment procedure. The correlation coefficients obtained for the dependent variables of (a) elapsed time, (b) number correct, and (c) comfort were 0. 98, 0. 88, and 0. 18 respectively. Validity of the level identified as optimal was determined by randomly assigning half of the subjects to a control group and half to an experimental group. The control group read a paragraph under normally available room lighting in both a <b>pretest</b> and posttest <b>condition.</b> The Experimental group read under normally available room lighting in the pretest only. The differential provision of the identified level on the practical task resulted in a significant difference (p = 0. 001) in reading rates between the groups. The findings of this study are limited to the parameters of the task involved and the order within the sequence of habilitative and rehabilitative service in which assessment was conducted. Discussion centers on the limitations of the study, suggestions for individualized assessment, and the utility of the procedure employed...|$|R
40|$|The basolateral {{amygdala}} (BLA) contains NMDA, AMPA, and dopamine (DA) D 1 and D 2 receptors and neurobiochemical events {{within the}} amygdala mediate conditioned-fear-learning (CFL) and fear expression. Long-term potentiation (LTP) {{occurs in the}} amygdale during Pavlovian fear conditioning and is associated with fear-memory storage. CFL depends on NMDA, AMPA and dopaminergic receptor-mediated processes and enhanced amygdaloidal synaptic transmission facilitates fear-memory retrieval and makes the expression of conditioned fear possible. Since mesoamygdaloid DA receptors contribute to CFL and fear expression, Experiment 1 A and 1 D examined the impact of intra-BLA infusion of the DA D 1 and D 2 receptor antagonists SCH 23390 and raclopride L-tartrate on the acquisition of FPS in rats. Rats of the Wistar strain were bilaterally implanted with guide cannulae positioned 1. 0 mm above the medial portion of the BLA. Approximately fourteen days later rats were assessed for baseline acoustic startle responding and assigned to drug-treatment groups. Forty-eight hours later rats were infused with either saline or the appropriate dopaminergic antagonist. The intra-BLA infusions occurred before five fear conditioning and testing blocks and were conducted to see if antagonism of DA receptors would prevent FPS acquisition. Retention testing for FPS took place forty-eight hours later. The results demonstrated that blockade of amygdaloid DA D 1 and D 2 receptors prevented the acquisition of FPS. The pretraining intra-BLA infusions of either raclopride or SCH 23390 disrupted the formation of long-term conditioned fear memories as rats treated with these DA antagonists failed to exhibit FPS on the retention test. Thus, the deficits in FPS displayed by SCH 23390 and raclopride-treated rats are likely due {{to the impact of}} these DA antagonists on associative learning and fear-memory consolidation processes. Experiment 2 demonstrated that fear-extinguished rats exposed to unsignalled footshocks displayed a reinstatement of FPS, but the exact neurobiochemicaI events involved in FPS reinstatement have not been elucidated. In contrast, fear-extinguished rats that received no unsignalled footshocks exhibited no FPS during final testing. Since unsignalled footshocks produced robust FPS reinstatement, Experiments 3 A to 3 D independently examined the effects of NMOA, AMPA, and DA D 2 and D 1 receptor antagonists on this phenomenon. Over a period of ten days, rats with cannulae targeting the BLA were base lined, fear-conditioned, pretested, fear-extinguished and then infused with either raclopride L-tartrate (8. 0 µg, 4. 0 µg and 2. 0 µg), SCH 23390 (4. 0 µg), (±) - 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonopentanoic acid {(APS); 2. 5 µg and 1. 25 µg}, 6 -Cyno- 7 -nitroquinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione disodium {(CNQX); 5. 0 µg and 2. 5 µg), or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) before exposure to five unsignalled footshocks. FPS reinstatement was assessed 24 hours later. Results from these experiments demonstrate that PBS-infused rats showed FPS reinstatement, whereas rats infused with AP 5, CNQX, or the two higher doses of raclopride failed to exhibit FPS reinstatement. Intra-BLA SCH 23390 infusions did not appear to disrupt the reinstatement of FPS in Experiment 3 B, however obstructed guide cannulae may have affected these results. In Experiment 3 C, intra-BLA AP 5 infusions made just before unsignalled footshock presentation, prevented rats from exhibiting FPS reinstatement during final testing. A similar effect on FPS reinstatement was produced by CNQX application to the BLA of rats in Experiment 3 D. The overall findings of Experiment 3 suggest that DA D 2 receptor antagonism and the glutamatergic receptor antagonists (AP 5 and CNQX) impaired amygdaloid fear-memory reconsolidation and retrieval processes by preventing the re-excitation of neurons and pathways that had become established during fear-conditioning. It is speculated that these drugs may have interfered with excitatory synaptic transmission processes and neurobiological intracellular cascades within the amygdala and thus prevented FPS reinstatement from occurring. Two expression-control experiments (Experiments 4 and 5), revealed that the observed blockade of FPS reinstatement in Experiment 3 could not be attributed to the drugs simply blocking fear expression since infusion of raclopride, AP 5, or CNQX into the BLA of non-extinguished rats 24 hours before final testing did not prevent rats from expressing FPS. Electrical stimulation (ES) of the human amygdala and temporal lobe region produces emotionally charged memory flash-backs and behaviours indicative of a central fear-state. ES of the rat amygdala is known to elevate acoustic startle amplitudes and enhance emotionality in rats and kindling of the rat amygdala exaggerates FPS and produces a variety of autonomic and behavioural fear responses. In rats, conditioned fear and LTP are induced by ES of amygdaloid afferents so it is possible that electrical excitation of BLA neurons can trigger FPS reinstatement. Experiments 7 A and 7 B were conducted to test the hypothesis that ES of BLA neurons can restore FPS responding in fear-extinguished rats. Thus, rats with bipolar electrodes implanted unilaterally in the BLA were baselined, fear <b>conditioned,</b> <b>pretested</b> and then assigned to one of five groups matched on FPS. Rats then received fear-extinction or no-extinction training, followed 48 hours later by either 100 unsignalled electrical stimulations of the BLA or no stimulation. Experimental groups included; [Extinction + Stimulation (N= 12), Extinction + No stimulation (N= 12), No Extinction + No stimulation (N= 12), No Extinction + Stimulation (N= 11) and Extinction + Stimulation out of context (N= 12) ]. FPS reinstatement was assessed 24 hours later and BLA AD-current threshold were recorded four days after FPS reinstatement testing was completed. Experiment 7 A demonstrated that all experimental groups exhibited FPS except the Extinction + No stimulation control group which displayed a robust extinction effect. Most importantly, the Extinction + Stimulation group exhibited statistically significant FPS reinstatement after ES of the amygdala. Experiment 7 B demonstrated that ES of the amygdala in a context different to the startle apparatus also produced FPS reinstatement in fear-extinguished rats. However, the magnitude of this FPS reinstatement effect was much smaller than that obtained when rats received ES of the amygdala in the startle testing apparatus. The overall finding that ES of the BLA causes FPS reinstatement in fear-extinguished rats suggests that ES of the BLA resensitised fear-memory systems and restored FPS responding. This effect was likely achieved by exciting amygdaloid neurons and pathways containing the memory-trace of the CS-UCS association originally established during Pavlovian fear conditioning. Experiments 8 to 10 used the same protocol as Experiment 7 A and investigated whether ES of other brain regions that share reciprocal connections with the amygdala would trigger FPS reinstatement in fear-extinguished rats. Rats in Experiments 8 to 10 had bipolar electrodes unilaterally implanted in the perirhinal/insular cortex (PRh/IC), dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG), ventral tegmental area (VTA) and ventral periaqueductal gray (vPAG). Experiment 8 revealed that ES of the PRh/IC produced a positive trend towards FPS reinstatement. Experiment 9 examined the impact of dPAG and VTA ES on FPS reinstatement. This experiment demonstrated that VTA but not dPAG ES produced a FPS reinstatement effect. This finding seems to support the research evidence that highlights the importance of mesoamygdaloid systems in mediating conditioned fear and stress responses. Experiment 10 assessed the impact of vPAG ES on FPS reinstatement and discovered that stimulation of this region did not trigger a restoration of FPS in fear-extinguished rats but it did seem to elevate overall acoustic startle responding during final testing, This finding would seem to indicate that ES of the vPAG likely increased contextual fear but not cue specific fear since acoustic startle amplitudes during both the noise-alone and the CS + noise conditions were elevated, The key finding that ES of the amygdala produces robust FPS reinstatement provides further proof that the amygdala and its afferent and efferent neural circuits are essential for fear-memory reconsolidation and conditioned fear expression and reinstatement...|$|R
