40|$|An on-line {{parameter}} identification method is presented. The method {{is based on}} a recursive formulation of the maximum likelihood method, with a significant modification on the gains of the state estimator. In the conventional maximum likelihood method, the Kalman gains are used in the state estimator. This produces unbiased, minimum variance parameter estimates in the presence of process noise and measurement noise, but it also slows the convergence rate when the identification is done on-line. Here we suggest choosing the gains to maximize a measure of the sensitivities of the state estimates to parameter variations. One such criterion is to minimize the trace of the inverse information matrix. This increases the convergence rate significantly. After one or two time constants, the gains are switched to the Kalman values to assure unbiased, minimum-variance estimates. The state estimate will initially be nonoptimal, and may not be adequate for control purposes. In this case, a parallel Kalman filter which uses the <b>identifier's</b> <b>parameter</b> estimates can be used.

40|$|Fast self-tuning discrete-time control {{algorithms}} {{based on}} 'recursive least squares' parameter estimation and 'generalized minimum-variance' (GMV) control design are presented both in lattice and transversal forms. This derivation relies {{both on the}} linear prediction interpretation of GMV control and on the embedding of the pole-zero predictive model (for the system output) into a multichannel all-pole model for the joint system input-output process. The proposed multichannel algorithms are simplified via a modular decomposition principle which converts all matrix recursions into coupled scalar recursions. The resulting control algorithms require 0 (n) computations per time instant, where n denotes the controller order. Furthermore, we present parallel implementations of such fast 'self-tuning controllers' (STCs) in O(n) processor arrays. Several structures, obtained for different implementations of the controller and of the identifier, are devised to this end but, {{as far as we}} are concerned with an 'ideal' STC (i. e. one which generates the control signal at each time instant with the best and most recent currently available parameter estimates), none of them can lead to a pipelined STC. We show that a pipelined STC can be obtained by implementing the controller in transversal form and introducing an O(n) 'lag' in the transfer of <b>parameters</b> from the <b>identifier</b> to the controller.
