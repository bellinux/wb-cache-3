40|$|Information Technology, AbesEngg. Coll ege,Ghaziabad The paper {{presents}} a {{system based on}} biometrics that generates the person‟s face by <b>scanning</b> of the <b>palm.</b> It does the recognition of an unknown person which is not enrolled in the database before. A new approach is introduced using Biometrics where high security tasks like criminal identification and investigation, along with various other applications like extracting the person‟s detail from the universal database of a country/place, recognizing {{the face of the}} person who met with some casualties, checking out the last person who attended the ATM machine,etc. The study shows that there is a relationship between palm and face. Just by the <b>palm</b> <b>scan</b> the proposed system will generate eyes, nose, eyebrows and lips of new person. And by recognition of the person by the generated face features further investigation can be done by central database of the country/place...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new method is {{proposed}} for palmprint verification using Linear Discriminant Analysis. The verification system is {{consists of two}} steps: One is enrolment step; the second one is verification step. In the enrollment step the <b>palm</b> is <b>scanned</b> and its region of interest (ROI) is extracted. After then ROI and it is owner’s name stored in the database. Several palm images are stored database like using same methods. In verification steps <b>palm</b> image is <b>scanned</b> for verification. The image’s ROI is extracted. The feature vector has been obtained by applying discrete cosine transform to a data extracted from ROI. The proposed method is tested with ORL database {{and the results are}} compared with palmprint verification using line edge maps and palmprint verification using linear discriminant analysis. Verification error rate obtained is approximately 3 %, which is a significant result with respect to other available palm verification algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{the domain}} of Biometrics, {{recognition}} systems based on iris, fingerprint or <b>palm</b> print <b>scans</b> etc. are often considered more dependable due to extremely low variance in the properties of these entities with respect to time. However, {{over the last decade}} data processing capability of computers has increased manifold, which has made real-time video content analysis possible. This shows that the need of the hour is a robust and highly automated Face Detection and Recognition algorithm with credible accuracy rate. The proposed Face Detection and Recognition system using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) accepts face frames as input from a database containing images from low cost devices such as VGA cameras, webcams or even CCTV’s, where image quality is inferior. Face region is then detected using properties of L*a*b * color space and only Frontal Face is extracted such that all additional background is eliminated. Further, this extracted image is converted to grayscale and its dimensions are resized to 128 x 128 pixels. DWT is then applied to entire image to obtain the coefficients. Recognition is carried out by comparison of the DWT coefficients belonging to the test image with those of the registered reference image. On comparison, Euclidean distance classifier is deployed to validate the test image from the database. Accuracy for various levels of DWT Decomposition is obtained and hence, compared...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{localize}} proteins precisely within subcellular space {{is crucial to}} understanding the functioning of biological systems. Recently, we described a protocol that correlates a precise map of fluorescent fusion proteins localized using three-dimensional super-resolution optical microscopy with the fine ultrastructural context of three-dimensional electron micrographs. While it achieved the difficult simultaneous objectives of high photoactivated fluorophore preservation and ultrastructure preservation, it required a super-resolution optical and specialized electron microscope that is not available to many researchers. We present here a faster and more practical protocol with {{the advantage of a}} simpler two-dimensional optical (Photoactivated Localization Microscopy (<b>PALM))</b> and <b>scanning</b> electron microscope (SEM) system that retains the often mutually exclusive attributes of fluorophore preservation and ultrastructure preservation. As before, cryosections were prepared using the Tokuyasu protocol, but the staining protocol was modified to be amenable for use in a standard SEM without the need for focused ion beam ablation. We show the versatility of this technique by labeling different cellular compartments and structures including mitochondrial nucleoids, peroxisomes, and the nuclear lamina. We also demonstrate simultaneous two-color PALM imaging with correlated electron micrographs. Lastly, this technique can be used with small-molecule dyes as demonstrated with actin labeling using phalloidin conjugated to a caged dye. By retaining the dense protein labeling expected for super-resolution microscopy combined with ultrastructural preservation, simplifying the tools required for correlative microscopy, and expanding the number of useful labels we expect this method to be accessible and valuable {{to a wide variety of}} researchers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{transport}} corporation Röngårds Åkeri AB, {{located in}} Älvdalen/ North Sweden, faced {{an enormous amount}} of paper work when they took full responsibility for the transportation of all garbage for the commune Älvdalen. The company’s task is to take care of both industrial and private waste. As it turned out, up to 75 % of the work time was spent filling out forms and sending them to the secretary at the main sta-tion which in turn had to process the information to write correct bills. 	In order to make the business more efficient, its CEO created a new system. Nowadays, the drivers use a <b>palm</b> computer that <b>scans</b> in all necessary information at every place where they have to collect garbage. The information is then treated electronically and a bill can be sent to the clients already the next day. 	The technical innovation at Röngårds Åkeri AB relying on mod-ern information technology has not only saved the company a lot of work, time and money but has also changed the firm’s structure and how they work...|$|R
5000|$|Palmer has {{developed}} a technique in which she uses MRI and CT scans to 'map' objects by drawing or engraving details onto multiple sheets of glass to create a layered 3D image which appears to float in a glass cube. For Brain of the Artist, 2012, (collection Scottish National Portrait Gallery), Palmer created a self-portrait using MRI scans of her brain, carried out at University College London. [...] "The result is a most unusual and highly objective form of portraiture with a powerful, poignant beauty ... which develops in a challenging way the concept of self-representation."Using CT <b>scans,</b> <b>Palmer</b> also recreated an Egyptian child mummy in glass, which is on permanent display in the Ashmolean Museum. The sculpture is exhibited next to the actual mummy, allowing viewers to see details of the child as a three-dimensional drawing without disturbing its bandages. Using this method, Palmer has also created portraits of Carol Vorderman, the novelist Robert Harris (who based a character's oeuvre on Palmer's art in his book The Fear Index); the head of Eclipse, the world's most famous racehorse, and an endangered green turtle from Bermuda.|$|R
