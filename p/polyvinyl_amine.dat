40|$|The {{increasing}} {{resistance of}} bacteria towards common antimicrobial agents causes a significant {{need for new}} antimicrobial compounds. In this context, the present thesis deals with the preparation and characterization of novel multifunctional <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>amine)</b> s. <b>Poly(vinyl</b> <b>amine)</b> was successfully functionalized with quaternary ammonium groups and alkyl groups with the goal to mimic natural antimicrobial peptides and give access to novel antimicrobial agents. The post polymerization modification with functional epoxides was chosen as a versatile approach to introduce hydrophobic and hydrophilic functionalities into the polymer. The degree of functionalization can easily be adjusted by the ratio of functional epoxides to amine groups giving access to a high variety of polymers. The novel multifunctional <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>amine)</b> s were characterized in detail {{with regard to the}} influence of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance on several properties in aqueous solution and coated on surfaces. The influence of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance on the antimicrobial activity, the critical aggregation concentration, and the penetration ability into model membranes was thoroughly investigated. Different microstructures were successfully introduced into functional polymers having an identical chemical composition and molecular weight. The influence of these microstructures on the antimicrobial effect, the critical aggregation concentration, the viscosity, the ability to penetrate into a model DPPC membrane, the ability to penetrate into the outer/inner membrane of E. coli, and the hemolytic activity of the polymers was determined. The resulting multifunctional polymers can, e. g., be used as antimicrobial agents for surface coatings or textile finishings...|$|E

The biopolymer molecules can be covalently fixed on to the cotton by using friendly anchor chemicals like butanetetracarboxylic acid. The treated cotton are characterised through monitoring the susceptibility of the amino groups created on the surface of the fabric. The bacteriostatic effect was evaluated against Escerichia coli (E. coli) DSMZ 498. The results obtained show a synergistic bacetriostatic effect of the treated cotton samples by using chitosan/polyvinyl amine finishing system.

40|$|<b>Poly(vinyl</b> <b>amine)</b> (PVAm) was derivatised using 2 -thiophenecarboxaldehyde via Michael {{addition}} {{to prepare a}} statistical copolymer stabiliser for the synthesis of primary amine-functionalised polypyrrole (PPy) particles. A minimum stabiliser concentration of around 20 % (w/v) relative to pyrrole was required for well-defined PPy particles of approximately 100 – 200 nm, as judged by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). FTIR spectroscopy confirmed that stabiliser grafting had occurred, while x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies indicated a stabiliser surface coverage on the PPy particles of around 53 %. PPy particles prepared at stabiliser concentrations below 20 % (w/v) were not colloidally stable above pH 6. However, higher stabiliser concentrations (e. g., 50 % (w/v) based on pyrrole) led to a significant improvement, with colloidal stability being retained above pH 7. Long-term colloidal stability studies of PPy particles stored at pH 7. 5 confirmed that the amine-based stabiliser produced more stable aqueous dispersions than the imine-based stabiliser, since the latter bond is hydrolytically unstable...|$|E

According to the literature, most polyamines are synthesized from PVBC through the Gabriel reaction. In this investigation, we adopt Staudinger synthesis to avoid drastic decomposition which {{occurs in the}} Gabriel reaction during synthesis. Three types of polyamine polymers - homopolymer, block copolymer and random copolymer, were synthesized without incurring any crosslinking reaction. The amine-containing polymers can further undergo ring-opening addition reaction with N-phenyl- 3, 3 -dimethyl-azetidine- 2, 4 -dione. Notably, the intermediates, phosphine imine and azide functionalities can be easily converted into various functionalities such as carbodiimide, imine, imine, triazo, aziridine, etc. by adding suitable reagents.

40|$|Rising fuel prices, {{increasing}} {{costs associated}} with emissions of green house gases {{and the threat of}} global warming make efficient use of energy more and more important. Industrial clusters have the potential to significantly increase energy efficiency by energy collaboration. In this paper Sweden’s largest chemical cluster is analysed using the total site analysis (TSA) method. TSA delivers targets for the amount of utility consumed and generated through excess energy recovery by the different processes. The method enables investigation of opportunities to deliver waste heat from one process to another using a common utility system. The cluster consists of 5 chemical companies producing a variety of products, including polyethylene (PE), <b>polyvinyl</b> chloride (PVC), <b>amines,</b> ethylene, oxygen/nitrogen and plasticisers. The companies already work together by exchanging material streams. In this study the potential for energy collaboration is analysed in order to reach an industrial symbiosis. The overall heating and cooling demands of the site are around 442 MW and 953 MW, respectively. 122 MW of heat is produced in boilers and delivered to the processes. TSA is used to stepwise design a site-wide utility system which improves energy efficiency. It is shown that heat recovery in the cluster can be increased by 129 MW, i. e. the current utility demand could be completely eliminated and further 7 MW excess steam can be made available. The proposed retrofitted utility system involves the introduction of a site-wide hot water circuit, increased recovery of low pressure steam and shifting of heating steam pressure to lower levels in a number heat exchangers when possible. Qualitative evaluation of the suggested measures shows that 60 MW of the savings potential could to be achieved with moderate changes to the process utility system corresponding to 50 % of the heat produced from purchased fuel in the boilers of the cluster. Further analysis showed that after implementation of the suggested energy efficiency measures there is still a large excess of heat at temperatures of up to 137 °C...|$|R
5000|$|Polyamides (PA), high-performance, {{for severe}} environments; {{high-temperature}} glues; typically applied at over 200 °C, but can degrade and char during processing. In molten state can somewhat degrade by atmospheric oxygen. High application temperature. High range of service temperatures, generally showing adequate bonding from -40 to 70 °C; some compositions allow operation to 185 °C {{if they do}} not have to carry load. Resistant to plasticizers, therefore suitable for gluing polyvinyl chloride; only polyamides derived from secondary diamines however provide a satisfying bond. Resistant to oils and gasoline. Good adhesion to many substrates such as metal, wood, vinyl, ABS, and treated polyethylene and polypropylene. Some formulations are UL-approved for electrical applications requiring reduced flammability. Three groups are employed, with low, intermediate, and high molecular weight; the low MW ones are low-temperature melting and easy to apply, but have lower tensile strength, lower tensile-shear strength, and lower elongation than the high-MW ones. The high-MW ones require sophisticated extruders and are used as high-performance structural adhesives. The presence of hydrogen bonds between the polymer chains gives polyamides a high strength at even low molecular weights, in comparison with other polymers. Hydrogen bonds also provide retention of most of the adhesive strength up almost to the melting point; however they also make the material more susceptible to permeation of moisture in comparison with polyesters. Can be formulated as soft and tacky or as hard and rigid. Niche applications, together with polyesters taking less than 10% of total volume of hot melt adhesives market. Absorption of moisture may lead to foaming during application as water evaporates during melting, leaving voids in the adhesive layer which degrade mechanical strength. Polyamide HMAs are usually composed of a dimer acid with often two or more different diamines. The dimer acid usually presents 60-80% of the total polyamide mass, and provides amorphous nonpolar character. Linear aliphatic amines such as ethylene diamine and hexamethylene diamine, provide hardness and strength. Longer chain amines such as dimer amine, reduce the amount of hydrogen bonds per volume of material, resulting in lower stiffness. Polyether diamines provide good low-temperature flexibility. Piperazine and similar diamines also reduce the number of hydrogen bonds. Only polyamides based on piperazine and similar secondary amines form satisfactory bond with <b>polyvinyl</b> chloride; primary <b>amines</b> form stronger hydrogen bonds within the adhesive, secondary amines can act only as proton acceptors, don't form hydrogen bonds within the polyamide, and are therefore free to form weaker bonds with vinyl, probably with the hydrogen atom adjacent to the chlorine.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Novel surface plasmon {{resonance}} (SPR) sensing surfaces {{were developed}} {{from the perspective of}} reversible self assembling of the mixed dextran surfactant polymers onto SPR gold chips. Two comb-like dextran surfactant polymers, which are different in their dextran molecular weight (MW) distribution and the presence of amine functional groups, and their characterization were synthesized. These structurally well-defined surfactant polymers include a bimodal amine dextran surfactant polymer and a monomodal dextran surfactant polymer. The bimodal one consists of <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>amine)</b> (PVAm) backbone with amine functionalized high MW dextran, non-functionalized low MW dextran and hydrophobic hexyl pendant groups. Allyl high MW dextran aldonic acid and low MW dextran aldonic acid chains with various ratios were sequentially attached to PVAm. The unreacted amine groups on the backbone were further grafted with hexanoic acid and the allyl groups on the high MW dextran were finally converted to amine. The monomodal surfactant polymer, PVAm with non-functionalized low MW dextran and hexyl branches, was synthesized and characterized using similar procedures, except with the absence of allyl high MW dextran aldonic acid and the amine functionalization. The molecular compositions of the surfactant polymers were determined by FTIR an...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{the use of}} nanocellulose in {{advanced}} technological applications has been promoted both due the excellent properties of this material in combination with its renewability. In this study, multilayered thin films composed of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC), <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>amine</b> (PVAm) and silica nanoparticles were fabricated on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using a layer-by-layer adsorption technique. The multilayer build-up was followed in situ by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, which indicated that the PVAm-SiO(2) -PVAm-NFC system adsorbs twice as much wet mass material compared to the PVAm-NFC system for {{the same number of}} bilayers. This is accompanied with a higher viscoelasticity for the PVAm-SiO(2) -PVAm-NFC system. Ellipsometry indicated a dry-state thickness of 2. 2 and 3. 4 nm per bilayer for the PVAm-NFC system and the PVAm-SiO(2) -PVAm-NFC system, respectively. Atomic force microscopy height images indicate that in both systems, a porous network structure is achieved. Youngs modulus of these thin films was determined by the Strain-Induced Elastic Buckling Instability for Mechanical Measurements (SIEBIMM) technique. The Youngs modulus of the PVAm/NFC films was doubled, from 1 to 2 GPa, upon incorporation of silica nanoparticles in the films. The introduction of the silica nanoparticles lowered the refractive index of the films, most probably due to an increased porosity of the films...|$|E

Among these membranes tested, the membranes prepared from casting solutions of pH X and Y showed the best results. In this thesis a general trend was displayed for the PVAm FSC membrane of increased separation performance with increasing casting solution pH used {{to prepare the}} membranes. This general trend applied for the PVAm FSC membranes tested at feed pressures from 1. 1 bar up to 8 bar. The effect of NO 2 contamination on the separation performance of the PVAm FSC membrane was investigated.

The water solubility of 1 has been mediated by 2, 6 - O -&# 946;-dimethylcyclodextrin or by pre-adsorption onto silica particles.

In this master's thesis, a selection of nanoparticle reinforced PVAm/PVA blend FSC membranes have been prepared and tested at high pressure {{for natural gas}} sweetening. An ultra-thin selective layer was prepared from commercial <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>amine</b> (PVAm) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and incorporated with either carbon nanotubes or fumed silica, and was cast on the support materials polysulfone (PSf), polyvinylidene uoride (PVDF) and cellulose acetate (CA). Permeation tests were carried out at a high pressure pilot scale membrane permeation rig, and the eect of pressure up to 80 bar was investigated. The permeate gas composition was analyzed with a gas chromatograph, and for a total of 11 dierent membranes, the CO 2 permeance and CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity was calculated. Scanning electron microscopy was employed to analyze the morphology of the membranes. Several preparational conditions such as nanoller concentration, solution ltration and selective layer thickness were explored and yielded good results.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comparative {{investigation of the}} properties of two polyamine, namely <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>amine)</b> (PVAm) and poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI). Hence, these polymers {{have been used for}} the preparation of devices with potential application in the (bio) medical field. In a first attempt, the preparation of water-insoluble PVAm mats of electrospun nanofibers is reported. The effect of the solution concentration, flow rate, voltage and distance between nozel and collector on the fiber quality, diameter morphology and stability are investigated. Mats with bactericidal activity were obtained and may be interesting for applications such as water filtration, tissue recovery, medical bandaging. Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) vascular grafts modification by means of PEI coverage is also presented in this work. PEI is investigated as precursor for star-poly(ethylene glycol) (star-PEG) grafting, which aims at imparting the surface with resistance to clot formation. Results from the stability, chemical composition and morphology testing of the surface of the grafts before and after coating is presented. Their resistance to protein adsorption, as main factor for clot formation, is studied at in vitro conditions with Bovine Serum Albumin as model protein. Although aside of the main topic of this thesis, the activation of the surface of inert polymers by atmospheric pressure glow plasma jet (APGPJ) is investigated for polypropylene (PP) as model surface. This study is oriented towards investigation of the temperature induced by the plasma {{at the level of the}} PP surface and its effect on the surface topography. Hence, APGPJ is exploited as very mild plasma to which selected chemical compoumds can be added to be pinned to a surfaces without major decomposition or oxidation. Different gas mixtures (argon; argon/nitrogen; argon/ammonia) and forward powers are tested in order to determine the optimal and less aggressive treatment conditions. Later, the APGPJ technique is applied for the coating of PP surface with branched-PEI by (i) standard dip-coating and (ii) solution-activated plasma-spraying. For the first two-steps approach, APGPJ activated PP samples are dip-coated by crosslinked, chemically grafted PEI coating. For the second one, the ability to form a PEI coating on the unmodified PP surface in one step is investigated. Hence, PP-surface activation, PEI spraying and grafting are simultaneously performed. The chemical composition, stability and morphology of the formed coatings are investigated in comparative manner. The bactericidal activity of the formed coatings is tested in comparison with a PP surface modified only by APGPJ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the synthesis of functional polymers prepared by ring-opening reaction of functional five-membered cyclic carbonates with polyamines. The functionality of the polymers defines their properties and their application: multi-functional poly(ethylene imine) s for antimicrobial polymer and primer polymer for textile finishing were prepared. The main concept for the synthesis of multi-functional polymers comprises the coupling of two (functional) amines using a dicarbonate linker, (2 -oxo- 1, 3 -dioxolan- 4 -yl) methyl phenyl carbonate (I). This molecule has two electrophilic sites with different reactivity: a highly reactive phenyl ester carbonate and a less reactive alpha-glycol carbonate. At low temperature, the phenyl ester carbonate reacts with an amine and forms a urethane group; it should be noticed that the only observed leaving group is phenol. The cyclic carbonate reacts via ring-opening at slightly higher temperature but only after total consumption of the phenyl ester carbonate. According to this observation, the dicarbonate I was reacted with an equimolar amount of the desired amines to prepare functional cyclic carbonates (II). Functional cyclic carbonates (II) were prepared also from (2 -oxo- 1, 3 -dioxolan- 4 -yl) methyl chloroformate (III) and from 3 -chloro- 1, 2 -propanediol (IV). More than 20 different cyclic carbonates bearing different functional groups such as hydrophobic chains of various lengths, ammonium groups, sulfonate groups, amphiphilic groups, reactive groups, and labeling groups (benzyl, pyrene, and fluoresceinamine), were prepared. If the ring-opening reaction of these functional cyclic carbonates with several polyamines such as <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>amine),</b> poly(allyl amine), poly(ethylene imine), and polylysine, were investigated, only reactions with poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) gave satisfactory results for both cationic and hydrophobic functional carbonates in terms of high conversion of the primary amine groups of the polymers and absence of side reactions. Multi-functional PEI can be obtained in a one-step synthesis by reaction with different functional cyclic carbonates. Amphipathic polymers act as antimicrobials, thus PEI was functionalized with cationic and hydrophobic groups. In order to study the structure–properties relationship of these water-soluble amphipathic PEIs, different parameters were varied: (i) the molecular weight of PEI, (ii) the ratio of alkyl to cationic groups, (iii) the length of the alkyl chain, (iv) the structure of the hydrophobic group, branched or not branched, (v) the nature of the ammonium group via substitution of a methyl group by long alkyl group. The critical aggregation concentration, the hydrodynamic radius and the minimal inhibitory concentration of the obtained polymers were determined in order to better understand the correlation between the physical properties of the polymers and the interaction with the biological membranes. For antimicrobial coatings two different approaches were considered: (i) water insoluble polymers (but soluble in organic solvents) such as PEI functionalized with octadecyl chains and cationic groups and (ii) water soluble polymers bearing reactive allylic, cationic and hydrophobic groups which after coating were thermally cross linked...|$|E
40|$|As {{membrane}} technology is energy-saving, environment-friendly and at lowcost {{with a small}} footprint, it has great potential to become a green and efficient CO 2 separation technology. Membranes with both high CO 2 permeance and selectivity are desired for membrane separation processes to be {{an alternative to the}} currently most commonly used amine adsorption process in medium to large scale applications. In this work, <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>amine</b> / polyvinyl alcohol (PVAm/PVA) blend fixed-sitecarrier (FSC) CO 2 -selective membranes were developed, and composite membranes with the homogeneous PVAm/PVA blended selective layers (0. 3 - 25 μm) on PSf porous supports were prepared to meet the requirements for competitive CO 2 -selective membranes. Different preparation conditions, such as the blend ratio of PVAm/PVA, molecular weight and degree of hydrolysis of the polymers, cross-linking conditions, selective layer thickness and membrane support material, were evaluated to optimize the PVAm/PVA blend membrane preparation procedure and improve CO 2 separation performance. The operating parameters were investigated with respect to relative humidity (0 - 95 %), feed flow rate (1. 0 - 5. 0 ml/s), sweep gas flow rate (0. 5 - 1. 5 ml/s) and feed pressure (2 - 15 bar). CO 2 permeance up to 0. 83 m 3 (STP) /(m 2. h. bar) with CO 2 /N 2 selectivity up to 174 and CO 2 permeance up to 0. 45 m 3 (STP) /(m 2. h. bar) with CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity up to 50 were documented during the permeation tests at their respective optimized operating conditions. The membrane showed good reproducibility in a 6 repeated test runs and excellent stability during a 5 month test. The excellent CO 2 separation performance, as well as the good mechanical strength and stability of this membrane are believed to be a result of the entanglement of PVAm with PVA chains in the blend membrane and the facilitated transport mechanism. Amino groups in PVAm work as CO 2 facilitated transport carriers while PVA offers an enhanced polymeric network with good membrane forming properties. The reversible CO 2 hydration reactions, initiated by the weak basic amino carriers in membrane selective layer are believed to facilitate the CO 2 transport, therefore CO 2 is transported through the PVAm/PVA blend membrane in the form of bicarbonate ions, which results in both high permeability and selectivity of CO 2 over other gases. The process simulation of a biogas upgrading plant (1000 Nm 3 /h) using membrane separation based on data from the PVAm/PVA blend membrane was conducted. Processes with four different membrane module configurations with or without recycle were evaluated technically and economically. The 2 -stage in cascade with recycle configuration was proven to be optimal for this process. The sensitivity of the process to various operation parameters was analyzed and the operation conditions were optimized. Since swelling of the membrane unavoidably causes the loss of mechanical strength, and the packing effect diminishes the membrane swelling capacity at high pressures, Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) were incorporated to reinforce the PVAm/PVA nanocomposite membrane and hence improve the membrane performance. The CNTs and PVAm/PVA blend polymer was proven compatible. Experiments showed that the degree of swelling of the CNTs reinforced nanocomposite membranes (1. 0 - 5. 0 μm) increased, and the CO 2 permeance increased 5 - 10 times at high pressures (10 bar and 15 bar in this work) while the CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity remained similar to its counterpart without CNTs.

40|$|Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEG), {{polyether}} molecule {{of repeating}} ethylene oxide segments, {{is the most}} used synthetic polymer with many advantages, such as hydrophilicity, inert structure, non-immunogenic nature, and biocompatibility. Those unique features made possible their wide use in industrial and biorelated fields. Although {{the presence of a}} vast number of application areas, PEGs have come up with some notable problems, i. e., LCST, crystallinity, metal ion complexation. Many attempts have already been done for the synthesis of alternative molecules with the copolymerization of ethylene oxide with different comonomers (e. g., caprolactone, propylene oxide, lactide acid, and styrene). In this study, we studied six-armed star-type poly(EO-stat-PO) with various molecular weights (e. g., 6, 12 and 1 kg/mol) and terminal functionalities. The thesis started with a comprehensive review on the chemical nature and current limitations of the PEGs and insights into alternative PEG copolymers. In that section, the limitations of the PEGs were stated, and their alternatives were described with a particular focus on their applications. In the following section, rheology and dynamics of the copolymers were studied at entangled and melt states. Those molecules exhibited relatively low viscosity with strong shear thinning behavior. The relaxation of the copolymers showed variations with the polymer content and the molecular weight of the arm. Amorphous configuration was revealed for the copolymers and their interactions with water varied than their solutions in organic solvents with a possible scenario of configurational changes of helical chains. Those molecules did not reveal thermoresponsivity, however, nanoscale aggregates of the stars have been revealed due to hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with water molecules. Thereafter, we investigated properties of the six-armed sP(EO-stat-PO) and star PEG molecules having comparable molecular weights over viscosity, dynamics in water, phase behavior, and configuration. Both molecules exhibited similar viscous properties with a strong-shear thinning behavior and low elasticity. Amorphous configuration was revealed for the copolymer while the homopolymer was shown to be consisted of the highly crystalline segments. The size range of both molecules were in the range of 7 - 9 nm and the clusters of ca. 100 nm. In later section, those molecules were functionalized with various reactive groups (e. g., maleimide, vinyl sulfone, allyl, alkyne, succinimide carbonate, ethyl chloride, carboxylic acid, acrylate, aldehyde and silyl). An illustrative example, sP(EO-stat-PO) macromers with terminal acrylate and succinimide carbonate groups used for the layer preparation, and the coatings were evaluated over cell adhesion experiments. Isocyanate (NCO) terminated stars were used for in situ forming macromolecular networks with tunable structural inhomogeneity and elastic stiffness. In that context, water-diglyme solvent mixture at various combinations was used to control the kinetics of the hydrolysis of NCO groups and their subsequent cross-linking reactions. Such control over the cross-linking reactions significantly influenced the mechanical properties of the hydrogels and extends gelation times. Structural inhomogeneity of the gels was decreased due to the occurrence of homogeneous gel matrix. Those molecules were later used for cross-linking of elastin polypeptides over lysine amino acids, which present free nucleophilic amine groups to couple with NCO groups. Those gels were simultaneously functionalized with bicyclononynes (BCN) motives to create functional elastin scaffolds. In {{the last part of the}} thesis, star molecules and linear <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>amine</b> molecules were successfully used for the design of ultrathin nanolayers assemblies, which exhibited good stability at humidity conditions over three months. Beyond of the scope of the thesis, three different studies were also described. In the first part, alginate gel formation with well-known non-gelling ion, magnesium (Mg) was shown. Gelation in this system occurs at ca. 5 – 10 times higher concentration of ions than the reported for calcium-based gels. Alginate network formation with magnesium ions is very slow and is typically accomplished within 2 – 3 hours. Gelation with magnesium ions is also strongly dependent on alginate chemical composition as the presence of long guluronic units privileges faster gel formation. In the second part, redox-sensitive hydrogels and nanogels were produced by enzymatic cross-linking of thiol-functionalized polymer under mild conditions. Cells can be embedded in the hydrogels and proteins can be entrapped and released from the nanogels. These gels are fully degradable under mild and cytocompatible reductive conditions. In the last part of the appendix section, thermo and pH- responsive microgels from native elastin polypeptides were described, and the cross-linking of polypeptides was carried out by using either hydrophilic or hydrophobic cross-linkers. Both cross-linking approaches yielded elastin microgels, which revealed a volume change transition at 37 and 35. 5 °C and pH responsivity in the range of 5 - 7. Preliminary experiments were conducted to evaluate the suitability of these microgels for use as a drug-release system and demonstrated cytocompatibility, enzymatic degradability by elastase, and entrapping and slow release of a water-soluble biopolymerTo conclude, this study describes dynamics and intrinsic properties of the star typed PEG copolymers consisting of randomly distributed ethylene oxide and propylene oxide having various reactivities and their use as for gels and biohybrid hydrogels. These functional star type prepolymers are ideal candidates for a diverse range of applications as described above and have some advantages compared to the PEG homopolymers, which are respected gold stealth polymers for biological applications. We thereby believe that with further control of the structure together with appropriate degradable end groups might create multifunctional platforms at various length scales...|$|E
