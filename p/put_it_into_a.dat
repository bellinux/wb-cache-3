5|$|Permission {{was granted}} for flight testing {{to begin in}} April 1935, and Bajdak {{conducted}} his first flight in the prototype on 22 April 1935. For this initial uneventful flight, no weapons were installed and a light fuel load was used. The following day, Bajdak put the IK-1 into unplanned aerobatic manoeuvres, after which the wing fabric was observed as being slack. An official from Ikarus checked it and stated that this would resolve once the fabric varnish had completely dried. Bajdak took the aircraft for a third test flight the next day, which involved more unplanned aerobatics. When the aircraft was at , Bajdak <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> shallow dive and pulled up abruptly at high speed, {{at which point the}} wing fabric began to tear rapidly, {{to the extent that it}} could be seen from the ground. The aircraft dropped into a spin to starboard, and Bajdak baled out safely while the IK-1 crashed into the ground.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, most field naturalists {{continued}} to believe that alternative mechanisms of evolution such as Lamarckism and orthogenesis provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world. But as the field of genetics continued to develop, those views became less tenable. Theodosius Dobzhansky, a postdoctoral worker in Thomas Hunt Morgan's lab, had {{been influenced by the}} work on genetic diversity by Russian geneticists such as Sergei Chetverikov. He helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of microevolution developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of macroevolution observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book Genetics and the Origin of Species. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity, with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> more accessible form. In Britain, E. B. Ford, the pioneer of ecological genetics, continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s to demonstrate the power of selection due to ecological factors including the ability to maintain genetic diversity through genetic polymorphisms such as human blood types. Ford's work would contribute to a shift in emphasis {{during the course of the}} modern synthesis towards natural selection over genetic drift.|$|E

500|$|Congress {{eventually}} {{passed a}} watered-down {{version of the}} original plan put forward by Bedell and Senator Pete Domenici.

While other supporters of waterway usage fees, including Domenici, backed the compromise, Bedell gave a passioned plea for his colleagues to oppose it. He viewed it as lacking a crucial element of the original plan - that of capital recovery. The trust was optional, and the Government could spend money on waterway projects irrespective of the trust. The compromise was eventually signed by Jimmy Carter. Bedell's original plan never {{made it through the}} House of Representatives, but he continued to introduce it in succeeding sessions. It would not, however, get a floor vote in succeeding sessions.|$|E
500|$|In his own words, Ocean {{calls the}} album [...] "nostalgic." [...] He explains, [...] "it's {{a longing for}} the past. That's what this record felt like." [...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to get off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time.

500|$|... "Footprints in the Sand" [...] {{was written}} by Simon Cowell, David Kreuger, Per Magnusson and Richard Page, whilst the {{production}} was helmed by Steve Mac. It was recorded in 2007 at Rokstone Studios in London, England. Cowell originally {{came up with the}} idea to base a song around the Christian poem [...] "Footprints", and suggested it to Kreuger and Magnusson. They had a scheduled session in Page's home in Malibu, California and finished the song the next day. Cowell secured a songwriting credit for coming up with the idea. In an interview with HitQuarters, Magnusson said they had thought the song would be a good idea for Irish boy band Westlife, but it was offered to British singer Leona Lewis instead. When Cowell mentioned the song concept to Lewis, she agreed that it could be [...] "really quite interesting". Regarding the song, Lewis commented: [...] "Originally it was a poem; it's very inspirational so we <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> song.

The act nearly got the band banned from the U.K. for violation of public-decency laws, despite this the band's set was one of the highest reviewed of the entire festival that year, and was later included in a list of the top one hundred Reading or Leeds performances of the decade and was regarded as one of [...] "The 20 Grossest Moments in Rock" [...] by NME, ranking at number 6.

[...] "Footprints in the Sand" [...] was written by Per Magnusson, David Kreuger, Richard Page and Simon Cowell.
