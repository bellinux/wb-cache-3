5|$|A Sea Symphony (1910), {{the only}} one of the series to include a part for full choir, differs from most earlier choral symphonies in that the choir sings in all the movements. The extent to which it is a true symphony has been debated; in a 2013 study, Alain Frogley {{describes}} it as a hybrid work, with elements of symphony, oratorio and cantata. Its sheer length—about eighty minutes—was unprecedented for an English symphonic work, and within its thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that <b>pre-echo</b> the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow.|$|E
25|$|FM is {{also used}} at {{intermediate}} frequencies by analog VCR systems (including VHS) to record the luminance (black and white) portions of the video signal. Commonly, the chrominance component is recorded as a conventional AM signal, using the higher-frequency FM signal as bias. FM is the only feasible method of recording the luminance ("black and white") component of video to (and retrieving video from) magnetic tape without distortion; video signals have a large range of frequency components – from a few hertz to several megahertz, too wide for equalizers to work with due to electronic noise below −60dB. FM also keeps the tape at saturation level, acting {{as a form of}} noise reduction; a limiter can mask variations in playback output, and the FM capture effect removes print-through and <b>pre-echo.</b> A continuous pilot-tone, if added to the signal – as was done on V2000 and many Hi-band formats – can keep mechanical jitter under control and assist timebase correction.|$|E
25|$|When {{performing}} lossy audio encoding, such {{as creating}} an MP3 data stream, {{there is a}} trade-off {{between the amount of}} data generated and the sound quality of the results. The person generating an MP3 selects a bit rate, which specifies how many kilobits per second of audio are desired. The higher the bit rate, the larger the MP3 data stream will be, and, generally, the closer it will sound to the original recording. With too low a bit rate, compression artifacts (i.e., sounds that were not present in the original recording) may be audible in the reproduction. Some audio is hard to compress because of its randomness and sharp attacks. When this type of audio is compressed, artifacts such as ringing or <b>pre-echo</b> are usually heard. A sample of applause compressed or an excerpt of triangle instrument with a relatively low bit rate provides a good example of compression artifacts. Most subjective testings on perceptual codecs tend to avoid using this type of extremely critical sound materials however this type of artifacts generated by percussive sounds is barely perceptible on the MP3 format due to the specific temporal masking feature of the 32 sub-band filterbank of Layer II on which the MP3 format is based.|$|E

Design examples are shown, including a low delay filter bank which can be switched between 1024 and 128 bands.

2500|$|Tape echoes became commercially {{available}} in the 1950s. An echo machine is the early name for a sound processing device used with electronic instruments to repeat the sound and produce a simulated echo.

2500|$|Under the {{direction}} of recording engineer C. Robert Fine, Mercury Records initiated a minimalist single microphone monaural recording technique in 1951. The first record, a Chicago Symphony Orchestra performance of Pictures at an Exhibition, conducted by Rafael Kubelik, was described as [...] "being in the living presence of the orchestra" [...] by The New York Times music critic. The series of records was then named Mercury Living Presence. In 1955, Mercury began three-channel stereo recordings, still {{based on the principle}} of the single microphone. The center (single) microphone was of paramount importance, with the two side mics adding depth and space. Record masters were cut directly from a three-track to two-track mixdown console, with all editing of the master tapes done on the original three-tracks. In 1961, Mercury enhanced this technique with three-microphone stereo recordings using 35mm magnetic film instead of -inch tape for recording. The greater thickness and width of 35mm magnetic film prevented tape layer print-through and <b>pre-echo</b> and gained extended frequency range and transient response. The Mercury Living Presence recordings were remastered to CD in the 1990s by the original producer, Wilma Cozart Fine, using the same method of three-to-two mix directly to the master recorder.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new method for the design and {{implementation}} of modulated filter banks with perfect reconstruction. It {{is based on the}} decomposition of the analysis and synthesis polyphase matrices into a product of two different types of simple matrices, replacing the polyphase filtering part in a modulated filter bank. Special consideration is given to cosine-modulated as well as time-varying filter banks. The new structure provides several advantages. First of all, it allows an easy control of the input-output system delay, which can be chosen in single steps of the input sampling rate, independent of the filter length. This property can be used in audio coding applications to reduce <b>pre-echoes.</b> Second, it results in a structure that is nearly twice as efficient as performing the polyphase filtering directly. Perfect reconstruction is a structurally inherent feature of the new formulation, even for nonlinear operations or time-varying coefficients. Hence, the structure is especially suited for the design of time-varying filter banks where both the number of bands as well as the prototype filters can be changed while maintaining perfect reconstruction and critical sampling. Further, a proof of effective completeness is given, and the design of equal magnitude-response analysis and synthesis filter banks is described. Filter design can be performed by nonconstrained optimization of the matrix coefficients according to a given cost function. Design and audio-coding application examples are given to show the performance of the new filter bank.

These metrics are derived from psychoacoustic-basedconsiderations, in particular the masking effect, well known in the literature of perceptual coding. Themeasurement is accomplished through a virtual microphone array that samples the soundfield on acircumference. The soundfield within the circle is estimated by means of the circular harmonic decomposition. As a result, space-time impulse responses of the rendering system are obtained, which are then analyzed through the masking curve to extract the pre- and post-echoes metrics. A comparison between experimentaland simulative results, conducted using the same setup, allows to discriminate the impact of the adopted rendering engine and of the non-idealities of the real system (environment and loudspeakers) on pre- andpost-echoes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} Least-Squares (LS) optimal FIR inverse-filtering of an convolutive mixing system, given by a set of {{acoustic}} impulse responses (AIRs). The optimal filter is given by the LS-solution of a block-Toeplitz matrix equation, or equivalently by the time-domain Multi-Channel Wiener Filter. A condition for the minimum FIR filter length can be derived, depending on the number of sensors and sources and the AIR length, such that an exact FIR inverse exists, which perfectly separates and deconvolves all sources. In the general case, where an exact FIR solution does not exist, we discuss how SDR, SIR and SNR gains can be traded against each other. Results are shown for a set of AIRs, measured in an typical office room. Furthermore we present a method, which allows a time-domain shaping of the envelope of the global transfer function, reducing <b>pre-echoes</b> and reverberation. ...|$|R
40|$|The use of psychoacoustical masking {{models for}} audio coding appli-cations has been wide {{spread over the}} past decades. In such applica-tions, it is {{typically}} assumed that the original input signal serves as a masker for the distortions that are introduced by the lossy coding method that is used. Up to now, these masking models are mostly based on spectral masking. In this paper, we propose a new per-ceptual model for audio and speech processing algorithms based on spectro-temporal masking. A sophisticated perceptual model is simplified, such that the eventual distortion measure can be written as a frequency-weighted l 2 -norm. This yields the same computa-tional complexity as conventional spectral-based methods, but with {{the preservation of the}} temporal fine structure of the clean signal. It is shown that the new model can successfully avoid <b>pre-echoes</b> and can correctly predict masking curves for various maskers.

50|$|In {{an effort}} to avoid <b>pre-echo</b> artifacts, many sound {{processing}} systems use filters where all of the response occurs after the main impulse, rather than linear phase filters. Such filters necessarily introduce phase distortion and temporal smearing, but this additional distortion is less audible because of strong forward masking.|$|E
50|$|The psychoacoustic {{component}} of the effect is that one hears only the echo preceding the transient, not the one following - because this latter is {{drowned out by the}} transient. Formally, forward temporal masking is much stronger than backwards temporal masking, hence one hears a <b>pre-echo,</b> but no post-echo.|$|E
