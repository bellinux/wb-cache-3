5|$|Except for {{any move}} of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> {{captured}} (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces {{it on its}} square (en passant is the only exception). The captured <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> thereby permanently removed from the game. The king can be put in check but cannot be captured (see below).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to gameplay music, Underworlds theatrical trailer also uses orchestral music. The featured <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> the 3rd movement: Lacrimosa, from Mozart's Requiem in D minor.|$|E
5|$|If {{a player}} moves a pawn to its eighth rank, it cannot be {{substituted}} for a different move of the pawn when the player has stopped touching it. However, the move is not complete until the promoted <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> released on that square.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pieces</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} made in {{wood and}} sometimes in ivory. The height of the <b>pieces</b> <b>is</b> varied by class. The official colors of the <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> red and black.|$|R

5|$|The anime {{adaptation}}s {{have also}} been very well-received. The first episode of the anime adaptation earned a viewer ratings percentage of 12.4, behind Pokémon and ahead of Ojamajo Doremi. As of 2017, One <b>Piece</b> <b>is</b> among the top 10 anime in viewer ratings every week in Japan. On several occasions the One Piece anime has topped Japan's DVD sales.|$|E
5|$|The <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> often contrasted {{to modern}} {{magazine}} profiles {{in which the}} writers spend little time with their subjects or when writers fabricate elements of their story, such as Jayson Blair, Stephen Glass, or Janet Cooke.|$|E
5|$|The play {{deals with}} {{relations}} between Native Americans {{and the first}} European settlers in America. Scholars have debated whether the <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> progressive in its depiction of the natives and have commented that the work reflects an emerging American dramatic and musical sensibility. It served to popularize and romanticize the Pocahontas story as an important American myth.|$|E
50|$|In Murray's variant, {{the pieces}} have {{different}} colors with different point values. The number of <b>pieces</b> per color <b>are</b> divided as follows: 1 green for every 2 red, for every 3 yellow, for every 4 white. In a 15 x 15 square board {{that would be}} 22 green, 45 red, 68 yellow, and 90 white <b>pieces.</b> Green <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 4 points, red <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 3 points, yellow <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 2 points, and white <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 1 point.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the players}} {{agree that they}} have no more moves they wish to (or CAN) make, points are scored based on the total pieces in the towers players control. Large <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 3 points, medium <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 2, and small <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 1.|$|R
25|$|The two players' <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> usually colored red and black. <b>Pieces</b> <b>are</b> flat {{circular}} disks labeled or {{engraved with}} a Chinese character identifying the piece type, {{and in a}} color indicating which player has ownership. The black <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> marked with somewhat different characters from the corresponding red pieces.|$|R
5|$|The {{structure}} of the <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> unusually symmetric. It opens and closes with a duet including a chorale text. Harmonically, the piece begins and ends in C major, and the central movement is in D minor. The second movement modulates from A minor to F major, while the fourth movement mirrors this motion.|$|E
5|$|Artist Matthew Ritchie was {{commissioned}} to create {{much of the}} building's artwork. One <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> a metal sculpture located on the exterior in the courtyard that mimics the nearby Willamette River's watershed, and includes metal spheres attached to the line shaped metal. The other main piece of art is a piece with two lightboxes on the interior that display different images as one moves along the display that uses lenticular glass. Images represent themes {{of the river and}} of legal history.|$|E
5|$|In Suzuki's songwriting process, {{he would}} first compose on a {{synthesizer}} before working with programmers {{to get it}} in the game. His personal pieces play when the player is walking about the map, out of battle. Suzuki's favorite <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> the music that plays while the player is on a bicycle, which he composed in advance of this job but found appropriate to include. He wrote over 100 pieces, but much of it {{was not included in the}} game. The team wrote enough music as to fill eight megabits of the 24 megabit cartridge—about two compact discs.|$|E
25|$|As if this {{mosaic of}} {{unrelated}} <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> not complex enough, {{some of the}} assembled <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> uplifted, eroded by streams, and then locally buried in their own eroded debris; other <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> forced deep into the Earth to be heated and squeezed, almost beyond recognition, and then raised again to view.|$|R
2500|$|Wooden White chess <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> {{normally}} {{made of a}} light wood, boxwood, {{or sometimes}} maple. Black wooden <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> made of a dark wood such as rosewood, ebony, red sandalwood, or walnut. Sometimes they are made of boxwood and stained or painted black, brown, or red. Plastic white <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> made of white or off-white plastic, and plastic black <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> made of black or red plastic. Sometimes other materials are used, such as bone, ivory, or a composite material [...]|$|R

5|$|In any case, The Indian Princess is {{credited}} as being {{primarily responsible for}} elevating the Pocahontas story {{to one of the}} nation's most celebrated myths, and is thought to mark the beginning of the popular American genre of Indian Drama. The <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> also of note as one of very few of its time to have the entire musical score published and available today, as opposed to only individual popular songs.|$|E
5|$|One <b>Piece</b> <b>is</b> {{the best-selling}} manga series in history; it sold 100 million {{collected}} tankōbon volumes by February 2005, over 200 million by February 2011, over 360 million copies sold in Japan and 430 million copies sold in circulation worldwide as of October 2017. According to Oricon, One Piece {{has been the}} best-selling manga series every year since 2008 when the company began its chart. Due to promotions for the Strong World film, all 56 volumes of the manga released at the time charted on Oricon's list of the top 200 manga for the week of December 7–13, 2009.|$|E
5|$|Other {{variants}} {{were designed}} by Viquesney to depict different doughboy poses, but very few got past the drawing stage and none were ever realized at full scale. The largest variant actually known to be by Viquesney is a unique three-foot memorial in Lakemore, Ohio, also listed as The Spirit of the Doughboy by the Smithsonian. It was copyrighted in 1930 and dedicated in 1938. No full-sized Viquesney doughboys in any pose other than the original have been confirmed to exist. New information and photographs confirm this <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> actually titled Resting Doughboy and was copyrighted in 1936.|$|E
50|$|In 1927, the {{dismantled}} <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> {{found inside}} the Third Pylon {{of the main}} temple, constructed {{in the time of}} Amenhotep III, at Karnak, and between 1927 and 1930 all of the <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> carefully removed. These <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> then assembled into the building that is seen today in the Karnak Open Air Museum.|$|R
2500|$|Each <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> {{called a}} [...] "fers", {{the same name}} as the chess queen, as the move of the two <b>pieces</b> <b>was</b> the same at the time.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993 the <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> {{surveyed}} {{as part of}} the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! survey. At {{the time}} of survey, the <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> described as needing treatment.|$|R
5|$|Ten Dollar Bill (also {{referred}} to as The Dollar Bill) is a 1956 proto-pop art lithographic drawing by Roy Lichtenstein. Considered to {{be a combination of}} Americana art and cubism, the work is {{referred to}} as the beginning to Lichtenstein's work on pop art. Twenty-five editions of the lithograph were made by Lichtenstein, which were exhibited at several galleries. The <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> based on the design for the ten-dollar bill and has influenced several of Lichtenstein's later works. The picture has received generally favorable reception from critics, and is considered to be one of the best artistic portrayals of currency.|$|E
5|$|The 10-minute {{murder scene}} which forms the film's climax is scored with almost {{the whole of}} the Act II duet between Otello and Iago from Giuseppe Verdi's Otello. This is an {{atypical}} scoring for a film, since Verdi's <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> not an aria, but a dramatic dialogue in which the words are as important as the music. Thus the astute spectator will be presented with two dramatic narratives to follow; Allen is not respecting traditional conventions of cinematic accompaniment, since the score's events do not match the story unfolding onscreen.|$|E
5|$|The gold dollar or gold one-dollar <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> a {{gold coin}} that was struck {{as a regular}} issue by the United States Bureau of the Mint from 1849 to 1889. The coin had three types over its lifetime, all {{designed}} by Mint Chief Engraver James B. Longacre. The Type1 issue has the smallest diameter of any United States coin minted to date.|$|E
25|$|In some reconstructions, the <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> {{cylindrical}} {{with one}} end painted black for player A and white for player B. Undalled <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> turned with the painted end down.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> {{arranged}} {{according to}} the picture at right. All four sets of <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> used, but not every piece from the coral and green sets are used.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mechanic}} {{of jumping}} <b>pieces</b> <b>is</b> reminiscent of draughts (checkers) but differs in that no opposing <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> ever captured or otherwise {{withdrawn from the}} board nor is jumping compulsory.|$|R
5|$|The ninth nocturne, {{dedicated}} to Cortot's wife, Clotilde Bréal, {{is the first}} of three that share a directness and sparseness in contrast with the more elaborate structures and textures of their predecessors. The left-hand accompaniment to the melodic line is simple and generally unvaried, and the harmony looks forward to later composers of the 20th century, using a whole tone scale. Most of the <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> inward-looking and pensive, presaging the style of Fauré's final works, although it ends optimistically in a major key.|$|E
5|$|The purely orchestral works {{fall into}} two categories. The best-known ones in the West, and perhaps the finest in overall quality, are mainly {{programmatic}} in nature—in other words, the musical content {{and how it is}} handled in the <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> determined by the plot or characters in a story, the action in a painting or events reported through another non-musical source. The second category of works are more academic, such as his First and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta. In these, Rimsky-Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition.|$|E
5|$|The {{relief is}} {{displayed}} in the British Museum in London, which has dated it between 1800 and 1750BCE. It originates from southern Mesopotamia, but the exact find-site is unknown. Apart from its distinctive iconography, the <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> noted for its high relief and relatively large size, which suggest that it {{was used as a}} cult relief, making it a very rare survival from the period. However, whether it represents Lilitu, Inanna/Ishtar, or Ereshkigal is under debate. The authenticity of the object has been questioned from its first appearance in the 1930s, but opinion has generally moved in its favour over the subsequent decades.|$|E
50|$|The Square-1 {{consists}} of three layers. The upper and lower layers contain kite and triangular <b>pieces.</b> They <b>are</b> also called corner and edge <b>pieces,</b> respectively. There <b>are</b> all together 8 kite and 8 triangular pieces. The kite <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> 60 degrees wide, while the triangular <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> 30 degrees wide, relative {{to the center of}} the layer.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> {{commissioned}} in 2011 by the Adams Public Library after Greg Mendez had {{an exhibition}} of {{his work at the}} Decatur library. The <b>piece</b> <b>was</b> installed in October 2011.|$|R
25|$|Spain had {{the next}} largest medieval {{alabaster}} industry, whose <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> not always easily distinguished from English work, but <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> also produced in France, the Low Countries {{and elsewhere in}} Europe.|$|R
