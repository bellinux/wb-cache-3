40|$|Mobile laser {{scanning}} technology is developing rapidly also in mining. For several years research and tests are {{conducted on the}} use of that type of measurement in the inventory of the mine shafts. The company SKALA 3 D in the project 1. 4 POIG by PARP undertook to create Mobile automatic steering system of spatial geometry measurements mine shafts using {{laser scanning}} technology. Its main advantage is a faithful reflection of the object being measured in just a few hours. It is based on the data flowing from laser scannersand precision inertial unit. The main problem of the research was to determine the trajectory of the passing Mobile Platforms Mining (MPG) in the shaft as accurately as possible. Unable toreceive signals from satellites in the <b>pipe</b> <b>shaft</b> prevented the use of solutions known for measuring terrestrial mobile systems. The company SKALA 3 D has developed a methodology for determine the trajectory of the system, based on geometrical data coming from laser scanners and readings of accelerometers and gyroscopes of inertial unit. To improve the quality and accuracy of measurements MPG is also equipped with a set of anti-vibration parts prevent the transmission of vibrations ascending while cage is moving in the shaft on the measuring system. The whole forms a calibrated system, which in a short time is able to provide spatial measurement data from the measuring shaft. The accuracy of 2 - 3 mm in a single measurement horizon and a few centimeters determine the position of a point on the thousandth meter below ground make the system very accurate. During the project there have been numerous research problems, including the need to define the physical references, drift of IMU whether harsh weather conditions in the shaft. However, the company SKALA 3 D solved these problems and making MPG unique in the world...|$|E

5|$|Work {{continued}} {{throughout the}} night of 15 October and into the following day. It focused on finding survivors and fighting the fire that blocked the entry into some workings of the western returns. The fire caused the roof supports to become unstable, and falls triggered outbursts of methane. Several rescuers were injured by the falls, one fatally. Before descending the mine many of the firefighters wrote what they thought might be their last letters home, and some made their wills. As the water <b>pipe</b> in the <b>shaft</b> was out of operation, fire-fighting continued with hand extinguishers and work was only possible in 20-minute shifts. Despite wearing respirators, several rescuers were overcome by the effects of firedamp.

50|$|The {{impregnated}} tows {{are then}} literally wound around a mandrel (mold core) {{in a controlled}} pattern to form {{the shape of the}} part. After winding, the resin is then cured, typically using heat. The mold core may be removed or may be left as an integral component of the part(Rosato, D.V.).This process is primarily used for hollow, generally circular or oval sectioned components, such as pipes and tanks. Pressure vessels, <b>pipes</b> and drive <b>shafts</b> have all been manufactured using filament winding. It has been combined with other fiber application methods such as hand layup, pultrusion, and braiding. Compaction is through fiber tension and resin content is primarily metered. The fibers may be impregnated with resin before winding (wet winding), pre-impregnated (dry winding) or post-impregnated. Wet winding has the advantages of using the lowest cost materials with long storage life and low viscosity. The pre-impregnated systems produce parts with more consistent resin content and can often be wound faster.|$|R

40|$|Continuous {{furnaces}} with roller hearth have wide {{application in}} the steel industry. Typically, furnaces with roller hearth belong to the class of medium-temperature heat treatment furnaces, but {{can be used to}} heat the billets for rolling. In this case, the furnaces belong to the class of high temperature heating furnaces, and their efficiency depends significantly on the reliability of the roller hearth furnace. In the high temperature heating furnaces are used three types of watercooled shaft rollers, namely rollers without insulation, rollers with insulating screens placed between the barrel and the shaft, and rollers with bulk insulation. The definition of the operating conditions of rollers with water-cooled shaft greatly facilitates the choice of their design parameters when designing. In this regard, at the design stage of the furnace with roller hearth, {{it is important to have}} information about the temperature distribution in the body of the rollers at various operating conditions. The article presents the research results of the temperature field of the hearth rollers of metallurgical heating furnaces. Modeling of stationary heat exchange between the oven atmosphere and a surface of rollers, and between the cooling water and shaft was executed by finite elements method. Temperature fields in the water-cooled shaft rollers of various designs are explored. The water-cooled shaft rollers without isolation, rollers with screen and rollers with bulk insulation, placed between the barrel and the water-cooled shaft were investigated. Determined the change of the thermo-physic parameters of the coolant, the temperature change of water when flowing in a <b>pipe</b> and <b>shaft,</b> as well as the desired pressure to supply water with a specified flow rate. Heat transfer coefficients between the cooling water and the shaft were determined directly during the solution based on the specified boundary conditions. Found that the greatest heat losses occur in the rollers without insulation. Insulation (screens or bulk insulation) between the shaft and the barrel of roller allows reducing the cooling water losses. A comparative analysis of research results allowed us to find that operating conditions of the furnace rolls with screen insulation are more favorable in terms of thermal conditions and losses, than those of rollers without the insulation and rollers with the bulk insulation...|$|R

50|$|No {{external}} power is needed: the lift lock functions by gravity alone using the counterweight principle. One caisson always ascends {{and the other}} always descends during each locking cycle. When one caisson reaches the top position, it stops 12 in below the water level of the upper reach, and the control valve is closed; Siemens ultrasonic sensors are used to help determine the differential. The upper reach and top caisson gates open, and water flows into the top caisson until the level equalizes. The weight of the extra foot of water is 144 ST, making the total weight of the upper caisson 1844 ST. Any vessels that just ascended in the top caisson exit into the upper reach, and any new vessels making a transit of the lock then enter the bottom or top caisson from the lower or upper reach respectively. Once the vessels are secured, all gates are closed and the crossover valve in the connecting pipe between the ram shafts is opened. Since the upper caisson weighs more than the lower caisson (1,844 vs 1,700 tons), it pushes down on its ram, forcing out water from its shaft via the connecting <b>pipe</b> into the <b>shaft</b> of the bottom caisson. The force pushes up on the bottom caisson's ram, raising the caisson {{up to the top}} position. When the gate of the newly descended top caisson and lower reach gates open at the bottom, the extra foot of water flows out and equalizes with the water level in the lower reach of the canal, and any descended vessels exit, allowing the cycle to start over again.|$|R
40|$|Geologically, Nepal {{lies in the}} tectonically {{active zone}} and {{youngest}} geological formation in the world. Due to complex nature of geology, construction of underground structures is a challenging issue in the Himalayan. A complete geological evaluation is essential in the entire project area for technically viable, economic and safe construction of underground structures. Geological assessment is more significant for the underground structures; unlined power tunnel, settling basins, surge shaft, powerhouse cavern, tailrace and access tunnel proposed for the case of Nyadi Hydropower Project. Nyadi Hydropower project is a run-of-river type project, located in Lamjung district of western development region of Nepal. Using the additional tailrace water of Siuri Khola Hydropower Project, the project has been planned for an installed capacity of 30 MW with a gross head of 347. 5 m. The proposed tunnel length of the project is about 4000 m with 9. 14 m 2 in cross-sectional area and about 675 m long penstock of 1. 75 m diameter to convey 11. 08 m 3 /s design flow from Nyadi Khola to the underground powerhouse. The entire project lies in metamorphic units of higher Himalayan. This thesis aims to carry out an engineering geological evaluation of all underground works for Nyadi Hydropower Project. In this regards, an alternative alignment has been proposed with the unlined power tunnel about 4270 m long, 15. 4 m 2 in cross-sectional area in which about 2330 m is high pressure and remaining about 1940 m as low pressure tunnel has been proposed to convey 18. 5 m 3 /sdesign discharge to generate 249 GWh annually. The settling basin has been designed for fibre reinforced shotcrete instead of concrete lining {{on the basis of}} cost comparison. The proposedalternative alignment excludes penstock <b>pipe,</b> vertical <b>shaft</b> and also reduces additional tunnel length nearby surge shaft and access road to the adit of surge shaft which is considerable component for the reduction in overall cost of the project. About 5 million USD will be benefited from additional energy generation during wet season with this proposed alternative layout. The entire project is located in themetamorphic units of higher Himalayas. Faults and weakness zones intersect with the alignment of power tunnel at some sections where one parent thrust zone of tectonic thrust crosses at high pressure tunnel. Further stability analysis and rock support estimation has been carried out for the proposed underground structures. The unlined high pressure tunnel experiences hydrostatic pressure up to 3. 5 MPa (35 bars). The Norwegian criterion for confinement has been used to ensure safety against hydraulic fracturing in the pressure tunnel. This has also been performed by numerical analysis using Phase 2 program. Numerical analysis using Phase 2 and Generalized Hoek-Brown failure criterion has been used for the stability analysis and rock support optimization of pressurized headrace tunnel, settling basins and powerhouse cavern. Estimation of required input parameters for numerical analysis has been based on the preconstruction phase geological investigations in the project area and lab tested based resultsfrom the similar rock type with almost similar geological conditions projects such as Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project and Middle Marsyangdi Hydroelectric project have been used to estimate rock mechanical properties. Finally, conclusion has been made on the stability and estimated rock support for the proposed alternative underground structures on the basis of analytical and numerical analysis and recommendations have been proposed for good results that resemble with the ground conditions. </p...|$|R
