5|$|Plantinga argued that, {{although}} the first <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> not rationally established, {{it is not}} contrary to reason. Michael Martin argued that, if certain components of perfection are contradictory, such as omnipotence and omniscience, then the first <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> contrary to reason. Martin also proposed parodies of the argument, suggesting {{that the existence of}} anything can be demonstrated with Plantinga's argument, provided it is defined as perfect or special in every possible world.|$|E
5|$|While some 19th-century {{experiments}} {{suggested that}} the underlying <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> true if the heating is sufficiently gradual, according to contemporary biologists the <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> false: a frog that is gradually heated will jump out. Indeed, thermoregulation by changing location is a fundamentally necessary survival strategy for frogs and other ectotherms.|$|E
5|$|The game's <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to}} that of the {{original}} Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic's nemesis, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, is planning world domination through the power of the Chaos Emeralds and an army of robots powered by trapped animals. Specific to this game, he is additionally constructing an armored space station known as the Death Egg (a parody of the Death Star), also for the means of world domination.|$|E
50|$|The {{fallacy of}} {{exclusive}} <b>premises</b> <b>is</b> a syllogistic fallacy committed in a categorical syllogism that is invalid because both of its <b>premises</b> <b>are</b> negative.|$|R
50|$|But {{one could}} {{construct}} an argument {{in which the}} <b>premises</b> <b>are</b> inconsistent. This would satisfy the test for a valid argument since {{there would be no}} possible situation in which all the <b>premises</b> <b>are</b> true and therefore no possible situation in which all the <b>premises</b> <b>are</b> true and the conclusion is false.|$|R
25|$|At 30 June 2015, {{the company}} {{announced}} 1,011,973 <b>premises</b> <b>are</b> now able to order NBN services. Of that, 571,527 brownfields and 180,796 greenfields <b>premises</b> <b>are</b> able to order fixed-line services, Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull said. An additional 220,917 <b>premises</b> <b>are</b> able to order services in fixed wireless, and 38,743 premises have connected to the interim satellite service. There were 485,615 active users.|$|R
5|$|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic is a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle {{journalist}} Randy Shilts. The book {{chronicles the}} discovery and {{spread of the}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting—specifically in the United States—to what was then perceived as a specifically gay disease. Shilts' <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> that AIDS was allowed to happen: while the disease {{is caused by a}} biological agent, incompetence and apathy toward those initially affected allowed its spread to become much worse.|$|E
5|$|The boiling frog is {{a parable}} {{describing}} a frog being slowly boiled alive. The <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> {{that if a}} frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used {{as a metaphor for}} the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.|$|E
5|$|The show's <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> that Meyer is {{a former}} United States Senator who runs a failed Presidential {{campaign}} before being asked to be the winning candidate's Vice President. As Vice President, her world is kept in balance by her assistants: Amy Brookheimer (Anna Chlumsky) is the Vice President's chief of staff, while Gary Walsh (Tony Hale) is Meyer's grovelling personal aide. Selina also hires Dan Egan (Reid Scott), who threatens Amy's place in the staff, and Mike McLintock (Matt Walsh), a press spokesman. Meyer has no significant other, and requires that her daughter Catherine, from a past marriage, make appointments to see her.|$|E
50|$|An {{argument}} is “valid” {{if it is}} impossible for its <b>premises</b> to <b>be</b> true while its conclusion is false. In other words, the conclusion must be true if the <b>premises</b> <b>are</b> true. An argument can be “valid” even if one or more of its <b>premises</b> <b>are</b> false.|$|R
25|$|At 30 June 2015, 1,011,973 <b>premises</b> <b>were</b> able {{to order}} NBN services, 571,527 being brown fields and 180,796 greenfields <b>premises</b> <b>are</b> able to order {{fixed-line}} services, 220,917 fixed wireless, and 38,743 interim satellite service.|$|R
50|$|In 1923, the <b>premises</b> <b>was</b> sold to Wong's {{family and}} more houses were {{built on the}} garden along Kimberley Road. When the <b>premises</b> <b>were</b> sold house by house in the 1950s and 1960s, they were quickly {{replaced}} with multi-storey buildings.|$|R
5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{takes place}} in the fictional {{universe}} of the Castlevania series. The series' <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> the conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan and the immortal vampire Dracula. Thirty-six years before the start of Aria of Sorrow, Dracula was defeated once and for all by the Belmont clan, and his powers sealed into a solar eclipse. Shortly after Dracula's death, a prophecy was made that Dracula's reincarnation would come to his castle in 2035 and inherit all of Dracula's powers. This prophecy acts as {{the driving force behind the}} plot of Aria of Sorrow, and is the primary motivation of the supporting characters to be present. The game {{takes place in}} Dracula's castle, the most common setting for the series, with the castle divided into numerous areas that the player traverses over the course of the game.|$|E
25|$|Affirmative {{conclusion}} from {{a negative}} premise: If either <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> negative, the conclusion must also be.|$|E
25|$|Comedy Central advertised it as {{the first}} {{animated}} reality show, and in some episodes, characters participate in challenges {{that are similar to}} reality TV challenges, although the <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> largely dropped in later seasons.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the {{position}} of the middle term, Aristotle divides the syllogism into three kinds: Syllogism in the first, second and third figure. If the Middle Term is subject of one premise and predicate of the other, the <b>premises</b> <b>are</b> in the First Figure. If the Middle Term is predicate of both <b>premises,</b> the <b>premises</b> <b>are</b> in the Second Figure. If the Middle Term is subject of both <b>premises,</b> the <b>premises</b> <b>are</b> in the Third Figure.|$|R
50|$|The <b>premises</b> <b>were</b> {{almost entirely}} {{demolished}} in 1864.|$|R
50|$|Negative {{conclusion}} from affirmative <b>premises</b> <b>is</b> a syllogistic fallacy committed when a categorical syllogism has {{a negative}} conclusion yet both <b>premises</b> <b>are</b> affirmative. The inability of affirmative premises to reach a negative conclusion is usually cited {{as one of the}} basic rules of constructing a valid categorical syllogism.|$|R
25|$|The <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> that a mind-altering {{technology}} has for decades, {{at the behest}} of American intelligence during the Cold War, been withheld from scrutiny. Dispensing sensitive information in the interest of enhancing civilian life, the author shares his own notes as well as those left by earlier researchers.|$|E
25|$|The show {{is known}} for its {{portrayal}} of wealth, sex, intrigue, and power struggles. Throughout the series, the main <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> the longtime rivalry between the Ewings and the Barneses which came to head when the Barneses' daughter Pamela (Victoria Principal) eloped with a Ewing son, Bobby (Patrick Duffy), in the first episode.|$|E
25|$|Adam Warlock, under artist Jim Starlin, was {{influenced}} by Elric and made into a Marvel Comic version of that superhero, with concepts such as the Soul Gem stealing souls, the introduction of Master Order and Lord Chaos. The <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> similar to the Adam Warlock soul-stealing gems, which may well have borrowed from Elric.|$|E

25|$|Philip José Farmer {{portrays a}} very {{different}} Oz in his book A Barnstormer in Oz. The <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> that nothing after the first book occurred—Dorothy never returned to Oz, and instead grew up, got married, and had a son. Her son, Hank Stover, is the main character, a World War I veteran flier and the titular barnstormer. While flying in his Curtiss JN-4 biplane he enters a green haze and emerges in the civil war-stricken land of Oz.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} production {{involved a}} story {{that took place in}} the distant future. In this story, a crew of explorers in a spaceship visit an abandoned planet, discovering signs of an extraterrestrial civilization that left behind technological artifacts. The explorers initially assume that the occupants of the planet had died off, seeing no sign of them, but as the story progresses, the player was meant to discover something very different. This <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> similar to the finished game's story, but contains clear differences.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} Disney wanted to merge Tokyo (which {{is where the}} comic book version takes place) with San Francisco was partly because San Francisco had not been used by Marvel before, partly {{because of all the}} city's iconic aspects, and partly because they felt its {{aesthetics}} would blend well with Tokyo. The filmmakers' idea was that San Fransokyo is based on an alternate history in which San Francisco was largely rebuilt by Japanese immigrants {{in the aftermath of the}} 1906 earthquake, although this <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> never stated in the film.|$|E
50|$|In 1934 the <b>premises</b> <b>were</b> {{acquired}} by The Sisters of St Augustine, who established {{a home for}} the mentally ill, renaming the house St Peter’s Convent. The <b>premises</b> <b>were</b> enlarged over the years, becoming a care home for up to 50 patients, the 3 Sisters being assisted by 80 staff.|$|R

25|$|A reconstructed martial art {{necessarily}} {{rests on}} historical records, either combat manuals or pictorial representations. Martial arts reconstruction specifically does not claim an unbroken tradition of some historical martial arts. On the contrary, the <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> {{that in an}} unbroken tradition, styles significantly evolve over time. It is not necessary for the tradition to have been interrupted in order to reconstruct an earlier style; {{a case in point}} is classical fencing which reconstructs the sport fencing of the 19th century before it evolved into current Olympic fencing, or historical German ringen which over time developed into contemporary styles of folk wrestling. Claims of ancient martial arts which survive unchanged by unbroken tradition (e.g. as suggested by Yehoshua Sofer), do not fall under reconstruction and are by their nature unverifiable, even to the person making the claim.|$|E
25|$|The 1980s {{also saw}} the {{widespread}} acceptance of positioning theory. Although the theory originated with Jack Trout in 1969, it didn’t gain wide acceptance until Al Ries and Jack Trout wrote their classic book Positioning: The Battle For Your Mind (1979). The basic <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> that a strategy should not be judged by internal company factors but by the way customers see it relative to the competition. Crafting and implementing a strategy involves creating {{a position in the}} mind of the collective consumer. Several techniques enabled the practical use of positioning theory. Perceptual mapping for example, creates visual displays of the relationships between positions. Multidimensional scaling, discriminant analysis, factor analysis and conjoint analysis are mathematical techniques used to determine the most relevant characteristics (called dimensions or factors) upon which positions should be based. Preference regression can be used to determine vectors of ideal positions and cluster analysis can identify clusters of positions.|$|E
25|$|The state's {{ethnic groups}} {{are known for}} their unique musical styles as well as {{regional}} dances. The best known dance is the Danza de los Tlacoloteros. This originated in the Central Valleys region, and its theme is agriculture. The owners of “tlacololes” (cornfields) are called “tlacololoeros.” The basic <b>premise</b> <b>is</b> that these tlacololoeros chase away malevolent spirits from the crops, which are represented by naguals or fierce tigers. The dance has 15 characters. It is most often performed in places such as Chichuihualco, Taxco, Chilpancingo, Iguala and Atlixtac. Another dance that feature tigers is the Danza del Tecuano, where the animals stalk characters. This one is most often performed in Tuxpan, Ciudad Altamirano and Huitzuco. Other dances performed in the state include the Danza de los Diablos, the Danza de los Manueles, the Danza de los Gachupines, the Danza de los Siete Vicios, the Danza de los Pescados, the Danza de los Machos, the Danza de los Moros, the Danza de los Maizos, the Danza de los Zopilotes, the Danza de los Tejoneros and the Danza del Palomo de Guerrero.|$|E
