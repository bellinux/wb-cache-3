5000|$|Pneumatic drills were {{developed}} {{in response to the}} needs of mining, quarrying, excavating, and tunneling. In 1806 Samuel Miller invented a steam driven <b>percussion</b> <b>drill.</b> In 1838 Isaac Singer invented another steam driven drill. A pneumatic drill was proposed by a C. Brunton in 1844. [...] The first [...] "percussion drill" [...] was made in 1848 and patented in 1849 by Jonathan J. Couch of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. [...] In this drill, the drill bit passed through the piston of a steam engine. The piston snagged the drill bit and hurled it against the rock face. It was an experimental model. In 1849, Couch's assistant, Joseph W. Fowle, filed a patent caveat for a <b>percussion</b> <b>drill</b> of his own design. In Fowle’s drill, the drill bit was connected directly to the piston in the steam cylinder; specifically, the drill bit was connected to the piston’s crosshead. The drill also had a mechanism for turning the drill bit around its axis between strokes and for advancing the drill as the hole deepened. [...] By 1850 or 1851, Fowle was using compressed air to drive his drill, making it the first true pneumatic drill.|$|E

The forearm contraction level were measured by surface electromyography in four different muscles: Flexor Digitorum Superficialis (FDS), Flexor Carpi Ulnaris (FCU), Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus (ECRL) e Extensor Carpi Ulnaris (ECU). For the flexor muscles (FDS, FCU), an increase tendency in muscular contraction was observed when the operations are performed without gloves (2 - 5 % MVE increase in the FDS and 3 - 9 % MVE increase in the FCU). For the extensor muscles ECU a decrease tendency in muscular contraction was observed when the operations are performed without gloves (1 - 10 % MVE decrease).

40|$|Within the {{territory}} of Sagalassos, a classical city in the Western Taurus Mountains (SW Turkey), detailed sedimentological and palynological analyses in small catchments have revealed a strong local impact of human-induced land use changes on the physical environment during the so-called Bey¸sehir Occupation (BO) Phase. In order to test whether larger geomorphic systems respond similarly to human impacts in this mountain environment, we aim to reconstruct the late-Holocene floodplain sediment dynamics of the Bü˘gdüz River catchment (264 km 2). In total, 32 <b>percussion</b> <b>drill</b> corings, sampled every 10 cm, were made {{so far in the}} floodplain of the Bü˘gdüz River and a first approximation of sediment texture was made. From seven sub-samples, sufficient amounts of organic matter could be retrieved to be radiocarbon dated by AMS. First results revealed two distinct sediment deposition phases: first, up to 5 m of mainly coarse sediments alternating with thin silty layers were deposited. This phase was still active around Cal. 890 - 780 BC. Next, up to 2. 5 m of mostly silty sediment was deposited, the majority after Cal. AD 900 - 1000. No exact data on the transition from the first to the second phase are available, however. The average floodplain sedimentation rates, 1. 59 ± 0. 13 mm a− 1 for the first and 1. 46 ± 0. 13 mm a− 1 for the second phase, do not differ much. Towards the periphery of the floodplain, alluvial and colluvial deposits most likely interfinger, resulting in a considerably higher sedimentation rate since Cal. 780 - 410 BC (i. e. 2. 20 mm a− 1). Compared to smaller catchments, where the higher sedimentation rates during the BO Phase decline sharply afterwards, the sedimentation rates in the Bü˘gdüz River system remain rather stable, illustrating the greater buffering capacity of larger fluvial systems in response to important human-induced land use changes since classical times.

40|$|There {{are plans}} to build an energy storage in the rock at Önneslöv near Dalby in Skåne. The bedrock is of a part of Romeleåsen and mainly {{comprises}} gneiss, with elements of amphibolite and dolerite intrusions. The area is located immediately south of the Sydsten’s large rock quarry, which shows that the rock is mostly heavily fractured with clay weathered zones of different sizes. In connection with underground construction fractured zones and weathering constitutes a risk for problems with water inflow and stability. Furthermore, variations in depth to the upper surface of the rock can lead to stability problems in the upper portions of a planned construction. Electric resistivity tomography (ERT) is now an established pre-investigation method for tunnel projects, {{and it has been}} used on a large scale in connection with for example the Hallandsås Tunnel. The method provides continuous models of variations in the electrical properties of the rock in two (2 D) and three dimensions (3 D) that can be linked to variations in the rock mechanical and hydraulic properties. ERT measured by a combination of DC resistivity and induced polarization can be called DCIP tomography, which can provide additional information about the variation in the material properties of the rock. With the help of new and improved methods of data acquisition, processing and interpretation it is possible to collect large amounts of good quality IP data in a time and cost effective way, paving the way for better and more nuanced models of the rock and variations in its properties. The newly developed technology has been tested in full scale at Önneslöv. Three parallel DCIP sections about 1 km long, with a maximum survey depth of about 170 m were measured, plus a 800 m long cross-section. Furthermore, DCIP logging was carried out in two <b>percussion</b> <b>drill</b> holes down to 200 m depth in which it is furthermore made logging of diameter, natural gamma radiation, seismic velocity and flow rate during pumping. Geological interpretation of the DCIP results agree well with what one can expect from the documentation of soil depth, and variation in degree of fracturing and weathering as documented from drilling. A major advantage is continuous models that can be linked to variation in soil depth, structures in the rock and hydrogeological conditions. The combined surveys with surface-based measurements and borehole measurements are complementary and provide a more reliable overall picture of the variations in rock conditions...|$|E

40|$|Laser {{drilling}} {{provides a}} highly productive method for producing arrays of holes on planar and freeform shaped components. Industrial applications include fuel injection nozzles, {{printed circuit boards}} (PCB’s), inkjet printer heads, pinholes and slits for scientific instrumentation, high-resolution circuitry, sensors, fiber-optic interconnects, medical devices, and gas turbine combustion chamber panels. This thesis deals with time-optimal trajectory planning for two mainstream laser drilling methods: on-the-fly <b>drilling</b> and <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling,</b> which {{are used in the}} aerospace industry. The research has been conducted in collaboration with the Canadian aero-engine producer, Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC). The algorithms developed have been tested in a target application involving the laser drilling of cooling hole arrays on gas turbine engine combustion chamber panels. On-the-fly drilling is an operation in which each hole receives one low powered shot at a time while the workpiece is in motion, and the beam focal point is continuously proceeding to the next hole location. The positioning sequence repeats itself until all holes are gradually opened up in small increments. Each hole location has ample time to cool down before the next shot is received. Thus, this process can yield favorable material properties in terms of preserving the desired crystal structure, and also hole quality in terms of dimensional (size) and form (shape) accuracy, due to the reduction of local thermal loading. However, there is no existing trajectory planner, in industry, or in literature, capable of generating time-optimized positioning trajectories for on-the-fly laser drilling. This thesis studies this problem and presents a new algorithm, capable of handling 5 degree-of-freedom (axis) positioning capability. The ability to generate spline-based smooth trajectories is integrated within a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) type sequencing algorithm. The sequencing algorithm optimizes both the order of the waypoints (i. e., hole locations) and also the timing levels in between, which affect the temporal (time-dependent) nature of the motions commanded to the laser drilling machine’s actuators. Furthermore, the duration between consecutive holes has to be an integer multiple of the laser pulsing period, considering a machine configuration in which the laser is firing at a constant frequency, and unused pulses are diverted away using a quick shutter. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is capable of generating 17 - 25 % reduction in the beam positioning time spent during a manufacturing cycle, compared to some of the contemporary practices in industry. 17 % reduction in the vibrations induced onto the laser optics is also observed, which helps prevent downtime due to the optics hardware gradually losing alignment. The second type of laser drilling operation for which optimized 5 -axis trajectory planning has been developed is <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling.</b> In this process, a series of pulses are sent to each hole while the part is stationary. Once the hole is completely opened up, then positioning to the next hole proceeds. While <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling</b> is less advantageous in terms of local thermal loading and achievable part quality, it is used extensively in industry; due to its simplicity of automation compared to on-the-fly drilling. Thus, a TSP-style trajectory planning algorithm has also been developed for <b>percussion</b> laser <b>drilling.</b> The novelty, in this case, is concurrent planning of 5 -axis time-optimal point-to-point movements within the sequencing algorithm, and direct minimization of the total travel time, rather than just distance (in two Cartesian axes); as is the method for which significant portion of TSP solvers and trajectory planners in literature have been developed. Compared to currently applied methods at P&WC, 32 - 36 % reduction in the beam positioning time has been achieved. Also, 39 - 45 % reduction in the peak magnitude of vibration has been realized. Limited benchmarking with state-of-the-art TSP solvers from combinatorial mathematics, considering only 2 -axis Euclidean distance as the objective function, indicate that the proposed sequencing algorithm for <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling</b> is sub-optimal by 9 - 12 %. Thus, it can still use further improvement in future research. Nevertheless, the two trajectory planners that have been developed in this thesis for on-the-fly <b>drilling</b> and <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling</b> have experimentally demonstrated very promising improvements in terms of motion time and smoothness. As more advanced Computer Numerical Control (CNC) systems and laser control electronics with deterministic execution and rapid synchronization capability become available, such algorithms are expected to facilitate significant production gains in laser drilling processes used in different industries...|$|R

Based on these methods, the question, whether high pulse energy or a high repetition rate is more suitable for laser processing of CFRP, has been examined...|$|R
40|$|Results of spectroscopic {{temperature}} {{measurements of the}} laser-induced plasma generated during <b>percussion</b> <b>drilling</b> with a high power diode-pumped, pulsed Nd:YAG laser are presented. SAE 52100 steel was drilled with varying average powers. Helium and oxygen were each used as the shield gas. Emission spectra were collected with a monochrometer and an intensified charge coupled detector connected to the optical multichannel analyzer. The plasma electron temperatures were calculated from the relative intensities of the spectral lines. The spatial and temporal temperature distributions are presented. Both drilling times and spatial distributions indicate energy absorption by the plasma. © 1998 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
