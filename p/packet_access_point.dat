40|$|Abstract — The {{wireless}} multihop to an <b>access</b> <b>point</b> model {{appears to}} be a promising component of future network ar-chitectures, including multihop cellular networks and wireless access networks at the edges of mesh networks. Sophisticated software radios and core network protocols are being developed to support the integration of heterogeneous access networks. A challenge is managing diverse resources at <b>access</b> <b>points</b> (e. g., 3 G, WiFi or WiMax), as well as the distributed interference among the mobiles within a heterogeneous access network. We propose the use of a new anycasting protocol to guide <b>access</b> <b>point</b> discovery and path selection for balancing <b>access</b> <b>point</b> resource and routing <b>packets</b> to <b>access</b> <b>points</b> (APs). In addition, a hybrid proactive/reactive approach is used to reduce overhead of AP discovery.

The simulation study indicates that the use of the hybrid anycasting protocol for AP discovery, load balancing and routing, results in consistent performance improvements. I...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we proposes}} {{a method to}} utilize the huge number of IEEE 802. 11 <b>access</b> <b>points</b> in an inner city {{environment}} to distribute information such as local sensor values, votes or short text messages. Due to the overlapping channels on IEEE 802. 11 b/g {{it is possible to}} receive packets from neighboring channels by overhearing. This fact allows every <b>access</b> <b>point</b> to monitor a part of the frequency band without switching the current radio channel. Our novel idea is to add user data to network layer beacon <b>packets</b> which every <b>access</b> <b>point</b> continuously send on a user-selected radio channel. This method allows transferring small size messages between <b>access</b> <b>points</b> or an <b>access</b> <b>point</b> and a mobile device without any reconfiguration like disabling the WLAN encryption. We conduct a measurement in the inner city of Mannheim, Germany to evaluate the typical density and distribution of <b>access</b> <b>points</b> in such an environment. We then use the measured data to calculate for every <b>access</b> <b>point</b> the expected reception probability on the street segments around. Based on these statistics, we appraise the reception probabilities of the <b>access</b> <b>points</b> among each other and perform a simulation study to estimate the size of the dissemination area that can be reached. Additionally, we analyze the required time to distribute the information to all reachable <b>access</b> <b>points.</b> Based on the measurement and simulation results, we can conclude that the estimated connectivity of an ad-hoc network based on <b>access</b> <b>points</b> is sufficient to disseminate information in the proximity.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of serving {{multiple}} live video streams to several different clients from a single <b>access</b> <b>point</b> over unreliable wireless links, {{which is expected to}} be major a consumer of future wireless capacity. This problem involves two characteristics. On the streaming side, different video streams may generate variable-bit-rate traffic with different traffic patterns. On the network side, the wireless transmis-sions are unreliable, and the link qualities differ from client to client. In order to alleviate the above stochastic aspects of both video streams and link unreliability, each client typically buffers incoming packets before playing the video. The qual-ity of the video playback subscribed to by each flow depends, among other factors, on both the delay of packets as well as their throughput. In this paper we address how to schedule <b>packets</b> at the <b>access</b> <b>point</b> to satisfy the joint per-packet-delay-throughput performance measure. We test the designed policy on the traces of three movies. From our tests, it appears to outper-form other policies by a large margin...|$|R

They were designed such that an <b>Access</b> <b>Points</b> (AP) serves few associated clients with symmetric uplink/downlink traffic patterns. Usage of WiFi hotspots in locations such as airports and large conventions frequently experience poor performance in terms of downlink good-put and responsiveness. We study the various factors re-sponsible for this performance degradation. We analyse and emulate a large conference network environment on our testbed with 45 nodes.

We pose the problem of choosing the video quality and transmission power as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP).

40|$|Voice over IP (VoIP) is {{becoming}} more and more popular every day. The number of VoIP service providers is continuously increasing along with the number of customers they serve. Moreover, the latest generation of smartphones and mobile devices now incorporate VoIP support. This enables users within a wireless local area network (WLAN) cell to exchange VoIP traffic with other peers. This new traffic potentially poses a problem for WLANs, as the WLAN <b>access</b> <b>point</b> could be required to handle a large number of small packets of encoded speech. Since the access to the media can only be made by one node at a time, all of the devices must contend to access it. If there are multiple calls between nodes in the WLAN and nodes in the fixed network, then all of these packets must go to and from the <b>access</b> <b>point.</b> Moreover the <b>access</b> <b>point</b> needs to transmit the downlink traffic for all of these nodes. Because the <b>Access</b> <b>Point</b> has the same probability of getting access to the media as any other node, this can lead to high delays, and limits the maximum number of simultaneous calls to a rather small number, despite the increasing data rates that the WLAN interfaces are capable of. This project implements and evaluates a new solution that consists of aggregating downlink <b>packets</b> at the <b>access</b> <b>point</b> and transmitting a large multicast packet containing a set of voice frames that need to be sent to nodes within the cell.

30|$|With the {{popularity}} of {{wireless local area network}} (LAN), increasing the network coverage is the necessary development. IEEE 802.11 s draft [1] divides nodes into two categories, including mesh node and non-mesh node. A mesh node can support mesh services, but non-mesh node cannot, e.g., the original IEEE 802.11 station (STA) is a non-mesh node [2]. Mesh nodes are divided into two categories: mesh point (MP), which only supports mesh services such as route selection and <b>packet</b> forwarding; mesh <b>access</b> <b>point</b> (MAP), which provides <b>access</b> <b>point</b> (AP) functions for STAs and mesh services. For compatibility with the IEEE 802.11 LAN, wireless mesh LAN must be able to link with other networks; therefore, a mesh point portal (MPP) provides the functions of layer 2 bridge and layer 3 interworking [3]. Wireless mesh LAN topology can be mainly divided into 802.11 connected mesh and 802.11  mesh ad hoc[4]. In IEEE 802.11 s draft, the medium access control (MAC) layer protocol has great influence for wireless mesh LAN performance [5, 6] and it follows the original IEEE 802.11 e enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) [7], including congestion control [8, 9], power saving [10], synchronization [11] and beacon collision avoidance [12], and quality of service (QoS) [13 – 15].|$|R

Recently, remote wake-up control via a low-power wake-up radio (WuR) has been introduced to activate a node to instantly receive <b>packets</b> from an <b>access</b> <b>point</b> (AP). But link quality is not taken into account and protocol overhead of wake-up per node is relatively large. To solve these problems, in this paper, a broadcast-based wake-up control framework is proposed, and a low-power WuR is used to receive traffic indication map from an AP, monitor link quality, and perform carrier sense. Among the nodes which have packets buffered at the AP, only those whose SNR is above a threshold will be activated, contending via a proper contention window to receive packets from the AP. Optimal SNR threshold, deduced by theoretical analysis, helps to reduce transmission collisions and false wake-ups (caused by wake-up latency) and improve transmission rate. Extensive simulations confirm that the proposed method (i) effectively reduces power consumption of nodes compared with other methods, (ii) has less delay than power-save mode in times of light traffic, and (iii) achieves higher throughput than other methods in the saturation state...|$|R
