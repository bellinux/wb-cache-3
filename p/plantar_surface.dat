500|$|Dorsiflexion and plantar flexion {{refer to}} {{extension}} or flexion {{of the foot}} at the ankle. These terms refer to flexion between the foot and the body's dorsal surface, considered {{the front of the}} leg, and flexion between the foot and the body's <b>plantar</b> <b>surface,</b> considered the back of the leg. These terms are used to resolve confusion, as technically extension of the joint refers to dorsiflexion, which could be considered counter-intuitive as the motion reduces the angle between the foot and the leg.|$|E
500|$|Euryoryzomys emmonsae is {{a fairly}} large, long-tailed rice rat with long, soft fur. The hairs on the back are [...] long. It {{generally}} resembles E.nitidus in these and other characters, but has a longer tail. E.macconnelli is slightly larger and has longer and duller fur. In E.emmonsae, the upperparts are tawny brown, but a bit darker on the head because many hairs have black tips. The hairs of the underparts are gray at the bases and white at the tips; overall, the fur appears mostly white. In most specimens, there is a patch on the chest where the gray bases are absent. The longest of the vibrissae (whiskers) of the face extend slightly beyond the ears. The eyelids are black. The ears are covered with small, yellowish brown hairs and appear dark brown overall. The feet are covered with white hairs above and brown below. There are six pads on the <b>plantar</b> <b>surface,</b> but the hypothenar is reduced. The ungual tufts, tufts of hair which surround the bases of the claws, are well-developed. The tail is like the body in color above, and mostly white below, but in the [...] nearest the tail tip it is brown below.|$|E

2500|$|Esteban Sarmiento is a {{specialist}} in physical anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History. He has 25 years of experience with great apes in the wild. He writes, [...] "I did find some inconsistencies in appearance and behavior that might suggest a fake ... but nothing that conclusively shows {{that this is the}} case." [...] His most original criticism is this: [...] "The <b>plantar</b> <b>surface</b> of the feet is decidedly pale, but the palm of the hand seems to be dark. There is no mammal I know of in which the plantar sole differs so drastically in color from the palm." [...] (But see Meldrum, 170–71.) His most controversial statements are these: [...] "The gluteals, although large, fail to show a humanlike cleft (or crack)." [...] "Body proportions: ... In all of the above relative values, bigfoot is well within the human range and differs markedly from any living ape and from the 'australopithecine' fossils." [...] (E.g., the IM index is in the normal human range.) And: [...] "I estimate bigfoot's weight to be between 190 and 240 lbs." ...|$|E
2500|$|The four lumbricales {{have their}} origin on the tendons of the flexor digitorum longus, {{from where they}} extend to the medial side of the bases of the first phalanx of digits two-five. Except for {{reinforcing}} the plantar arch, they contribute to plantar flexion and move the four digits toward the big toe. They are, {{in contrast to the}} lumbricales of the hand, rather variable, sometimes absent and sometimes more than four are present. The quadratus plantae arises with two slips from margins of the <b>plantar</b> <b>surface</b> of the calcaneus and is inserted into the tendon(s) of the flexor digitorum longus, and is known as the [...] "plantar head" [...] of this latter muscle. The three plantar interossei arise with their single heads on the medial side of the third-fifth metatarsals and are inserted on the bases of the first phalanges of these digits. The two heads of the four dorsal interossei arise on two adjacent metatarsals and merge in the intermediary spaces. Their distal attachment is on the bases of the proximal phalanges of the second-fourth digits. The interossei are organized with the second digit as a longitudinal axis; the plantars act as adductors and pull digits 3-5 towards the second digit; while the dorsals act as abductors. Additionally, the interossei act as plantar flexors at the metatarsophalangeal joints. Lastly, the flexor digitorum brevis arises from underneath the calcaneus to insert its tendons on the middle phalanges of digit 2-4. Because the tendons of the flexor digitorum longus run between these tendons, the brevis is sometimes called perforatus. The tendons of these two muscles are surrounded by a tendinous sheath. The brevis acts to plantar flex the middle phalanges.|$|E
2500|$|As regards {{other parts}} of the skeleton, the {{proposed}} synapomorphies of pelagornithids and waterfowl are found mainly in the arm- and handbones: the ulna had a strongly [...] upper backside at its elbow end – at the handward end of which the scapulotricipital muscles attached –, a point-tipped dorsal cotyle and only a shallow depression to house the meniscus between ulna and radius; towards the elbow, the intercondylar sulcus of the ulna becomes wide and is bordered by a long winding ridge on the belly side. The radius, meanwhile, has a convex ventral border to the humeral cotyle, which prominently continues the hind edge of the knob where the biceps brachii muscle attaches; towards the upper side of the radius bone the surface becomes flat and triangular handwards of the articular surface for the ulna. The carpometacarpus of both Anseriformes and pseudotooth birds has a prominent pisiform process, which extends from the carpal trochlea far fingerwards along the bone's forward side. On the carpometacarpus' underside, there is a long but narrow symphysis of the distal metacarpals, with the large metacarpal bone having a mid-ridge that at its outer end curves tailwards, and the thumb joint has a well-developed knob on the hind side of its articular surface. The leg and foot bones, as is to be expected from birds not as specialized for swimming as waterfowl are, show less similarities between Anseriformes and pseudotooth birds: on the tibiotarsus there is a wide incision between the condyles and the middle condyle is narrower than the side condyle and protrudes forwards; the tarsometatarsus has a low distal vascular [...] with recessed opening on its <b>plantar</b> <b>surface</b> and a middle toe trochlea that is elongated, slightly oblique, projects to the underside of the foot and is pointed at the tip.|$|E
50|$|Colouration changes through development. Dorsum in newly metamorphosed juveniles is dark gray. The ventral {{surface is}} pale, {{partially}} translucent. Palmar and <b>plantar</b> <b>surfaces</b> are also pale. Later on, palmar and <b>plantar</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the posterior region of venter show a pallid orange colour that gets more intense over time. Larger juveniles have also dark green dorsal surface {{of body and}} limbs, dark blue ventral surface with white spots, and some orange-red patches on the axils and belly. Colouration is variable in adults. The dorsal colour varies from light to dark green to almost black. Ventral surface exhibits a green or grayish blue pattern with red patches; one patch is always present on abdominal region and axils, and often in gular and pectoral region. There are small white spots covering all ventral surface, including limbs, throat, pectoral and abdominal regions. Palmar and <b>plantar</b> <b>surfaces</b> have red orange colouration.|$|R

40|$|The plantar {{metatarsal}} arteries of some mammals were studied. In the dog, {{raccoon dog}} and cat, the second proximal perforating branch was fully developed and produced the plantar metatarsal arteries. These plantar metatarsal arteries {{ran on the}} <b>plantar</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the interosseous muscles along the metatarsal bones or intermetatarsal spaces, and {{gave rise to the}} digital arteries of the second to fifth toes. In the rabbit, a branch of the medial plantar artery ran transversely on the <b>plantar</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the metatarsal bones at a level distal to the bases of these bones, and produced the plantar metatarsal arteries. These plantar metatarsal arteries ran deep in the interosseous muscles along the metatarsal bones or intermetatarsal spaces, and joined with the digital arteries which were derived from the medial plantar artery. The plantar metatarsal arteries could be classified into four kinds of arteries (sM, sI, dM and dI) in relation to the interosseous muscles and metatarsal bones. This classification largely coincides with that of the human hand and foot (Murakami, 1969, 1971), the monkey hand and foot (Nakai et al., 1987; Hinenoya et al., 1987), and the forepaws of some animals, including the dog and cat (Murakami et al., 1987). </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{transmissibility}} of whole body vibration stimuli through human body in different standing postures to explore the mechanism in which vibration stimuli could be better used as a regimen for bone loss. Five volunteers were guided to stay at three standing postures and imposed of frequency-adjustable vibration stimuli on the <b>plantar</b> <b>surfaces</b> side-alternately. Motion capture system was used to acquire the vibration signals at head, pelvis, knee up, knee down and ankle, from which the transmissibility of vibration stimuli can be obtained. The results showed that transmissibility of vibration stimuli was closely correlated with frequency and skeletal sites. Transmissibility of vibration stimuli in head was much smaller than any other skeletal sites. Transmissibility in the ankle {{was always in the}} vicinity of unit one in all the three postures for the vibration stimuli applied side-alternately on the <b>plantar</b> <b>surfaces</b> of both feet. There was an obvious peak around 9 to 11 Hz in the transmissibility curves for knee joint and pelvis. In the resonant peak, transmissibility of vibration stimuli in knee joint and pelvis both exceeded unit one and reached 150 %. As the frequency increased after 11 Hz, transmissibility of vibration stimuli decayed rapidly as a function of frequency and dropped to 25 % at 30 Hz. This study may help to gain insight into the interaction mechanism between mechanical vibration stimuli and the responses of human musculoskeletal system.
