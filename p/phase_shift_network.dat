It {{is intended to}} be used with an external output stage and passive filter, for medium power applications of upto a few 100 Watts. The controller was optimized with regard to its loop gain to suppress the distortion of the output stage. In typical commercially available output stages, the distortion is dominated by dead time effects and the THD can be as low as 20 dB. The controller uses self-oscillation to generate the carrier. To control the self-oscillation a second order <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>network</b> is embedded in the loop. To increase the loop gain a fifth-order loop filter is added. For a switching frequency of 400 kHz the controller achieves a loop gain of 51 dB, nearly flat over the audio band. For reasons of flexibility, the order of the controller is made programmable, as well as the dead time and the delay in the loop. Full spice simulations of the controller combined with an external 120 Watt output stage indicate that a THD of upto 80 dB (better than 0. 01 %) can be obtained even under the worst case condition of a dead time of 50 ns...|$|E

This was due to a radical simplification of existing single sideband techniques {{by a group of}} General Electric Company engineers, which work was extensively publicized. The foundation of these techniques was the application of cascades of the well known, Muller R-C <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>networks</b> and other more complex lattices derived from this prototype. The theoretical discussion of networks appeared in December 1946 as the work of R. Dome of General Electric Company. In the Spring of 1948, this work was first {{brought to the attention of}} the author, then a student at the United States Naval Postgraduate School, Annapolis, Maryland. It was immediately obvious that existing design procedures did not result in optimum performance. The design procedure discussed here was first derived by the author in July of 1948 as a result of independent research stimulated by Dome's work, discussed in some detail below.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{provides}} the theoretical {{basis for the}} measurement of reactive and distortion powers from the wavelet transforms. The measurement of reactive power relies {{on the use of}} broad-band phase-shift networks to create concurrent in-phase currents and quadrature voltages. The wavelet real power computation resulting from these 90 phase-shift networks yields the reactive power associated with each wavelet frequency level or subband. The distortion power at each wavelet subband is then derived from the real, reactive and apparent powers of the subband, where the apparent power is the product of the v; i element pair's subband rms voltage and current. The advantage of viewing the real and reactive powers in the wavelet domain is that the domain preserves both the frequency and time relationship of these powers. In addition, the reactive power associated with each wavelet subband is a signed quantity and thus has a direction associated with it. This permits tracking the reactive power flow in each subband through the power system.

40|$|The {{noise figure}} {{performance}} of various delay-line networks fabricated from microstrip lines with varying number of elements was investigated {{using a computer}} simulation. The effects of resistive losses in both the transmission lines and power combiners were considered. In general, {{it is found that}} an optimum number of elements exists, depending upon the resistive losses present in the network. Small resistive losses are found to have a significant degrading effect upon the noise figure performance of the array. Extreme stability in switching characteristics is necessary to minimize the nondeterministic noise of the array. For example, it is found that a 6 percent tolerance on the delay-line lengths will produce a 0. 2 db uncertainty in the noise figure which translates into a 13. 67 K temperature uncertainty generated by the network. If the tolerance can be held to 2 percent, the uncertainty in noise figure and noise temperature will be 0. 025 db and 1. 67 K, respectively.

This is motivated by the possible {{reduction in the number}} of RF chains and analog-to-digital converters.

In this paper, we propose hybrid architectures based on switching networks to reduce the complexity and the power consumption of the structures based on phase shifters. We define a power consumption model and use it to evaluate the energy efficiency of both structures. To estimate the complete MIMO channel, we propose an open loop compressive channel estimation technique which is independent of the hardware used in the analog processing stage. We analyze the performance of the new estimation algorithm for hybrid architectures based on phase shifters and switches.

50|$|The {{operation}} is best {{explained in terms}} of the <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> the <b>network</b> introduces. At low frequencies L is low impedance and C' is high impedance and consequently the signal passes through the <b>network</b> with no <b>shift</b> in <b>phase.</b> As the frequency increases, the <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> gradually increases, until at some frequency, ω0, the shunt branch of the circuit, L'C', goes in to resonance and causes the centre-tap of L to be short-circuited to ground. Transformer action between the two halves of L, which had been steadily becoming more significant as the frequency increased, now becomes dominant. The winding of the coil is such that the secondary winding produces an inverted voltage to the primary. That is, at resonance the <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> is now 180°. As the frequency continues to increase, the phase delay also continues to increase and the input and output start to come back into phase as a whole cycle delay is approached. At high frequencies L and L' approach open-circuit and C approaches short-circuit and the phase delay tends to level out at 360°.|$|R
40|$|Planar {{electromagnetic}} lenses {{like the}} Rotman lens are attractive candidates for beambeam forming networks forming networks {{because of their}} high bandwidth of operation and their capability to form multiple beams at lower cost as comparable electronic <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>networks.</b> The principles of Rotman lenses have been studied for several decades and examples have been successfully built using different technologies, including parallel plate cavities fed by rectangular waveguides or microstrip lines on dielectric substrate. Due to the true time delay nature of Rotman lenses they theoretically exhibit extremely large bandwidth. However, lenses with rectangular waveguides as ports suffer from propagation of higher order modes inside the waveguide which limits the bandwidth to less than one octave in practical applications. Higher order waveguides, e. g. single or double ridged waveguides, allow for the propagation of a transversal electromagnetic (EM) mode and thus incorporate a larger bandwidth. But the symmetric nature of the TEM mode {{and the presence of}} the ridge complicate integration in the lens.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for high-speed wireless data communications to support consumers’ need for, among other things, real time streaming of high definition video and fast file transfers. One radio architecture that has a potential to meet the increasing demand for high-speed data communications is a radio technique based on the six-port architecture. In addition to high-speed, the six-port radio also allows low power consumption and low cost. In this thesis, a comprehensive study of the six-port radio technique for high data rate (> 1 Gbit/s) and low complexity are presented. Firstly, a technique to suppress the carrier leakage was proposed, analyzed and verified by measurements. The proposed technique uses only a <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>network</b> between the six-port correlator and its variable impedance loads, hence {{it is easy to}} implement. When the proposed carrier leakage suppression technique is used together with differential control signals, it also has the benefit of both improving the linearity and increasing the output power of the modulator. The same carrier leakage suppression technique can also be used in a six-port demodulator (receiver) to improve its performance. Secondly, Schottky diodes were proposed to be used as high-speed variable impedance loads. A six-port modulator operating at 7. 5 GHz, using the carrier leakage suppression technique together with Schottky diodes as variable impedance loads, was manufactured. Measurements on a 16 quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) signal with a symbol rate of 300 Msymbol/s, i. e., a data rate of 1. 2 Gbit/s, have proved high-speed operation, good modulation properties as well as carrier leakage suppression. Thirdly, a six-port demodulator was built for high data rate applications and measurements were conducted to characterize its performance. Demodulation of a 16 -QAM signal at a data rate of 1. 67 Gbit/s results in an acceptable bit error rate and error vector magnitude (EVM) performance. Last but not least, new diode configurations were proposed, analyzed and verified for use in six-port demodulators. Using the proposed diode configurations, the use of differential amplifiers, as commonly used in a six-port demodulator, can be avoided. Avoiding the use of differential amplifiers allows high-speed processing {{and at the same time}} reduces the power consumption and implementation complexity. In the context of the new diode configurations, it was shown that a six-port receiver has better EVM vs frequency performance and lower implementation complexity, compared to a five-port or four-port receiver...|$|R

However, current error-compensating algorithms can counteract the spatial nonuniformity only in linear miscalibrations of the <b>phase</b> <b>shift.</b> We describe an errorexpansion method to construct phase-shifting algorithms that can compensate for nonlinear and spatially nonuniform <b>phase</b> <b>shifts.</b> The condition for eliminating the effect of nonlinear and spatially nonuniform <b>phase</b> <b>shifts</b> is given {{as a set of}} linear equations of the sampling amplitudes. As examples, three new algorithms (six-sample, eight-sample, and nine-sample algorithms) are given to show the method of compensation for a quadratic and spatially nonuniform <b>phase</b> <b>shift.</b> © 1997 Optical Society of America [S 0740 - 3232 (97) 01604 - 9] Key words: phase measurement, interferometry, phase-shift algorithm, nonlinear <b>phase</b> <b>shift,</b> spatiall...|$|R
50|$|The filter {{produces}} a <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> that increases with frequency. It {{must have a}} maximum <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> of more than 180 degrees at high frequencies so the <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> at the desired oscillation frequency can be 180 degrees. The most common phase-shift network cascades three identical resistor-capacitor stages that produce a <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> of zero at low frequencies and 270° at high frequencies.|$|R

This is because light traveling toward the rear of a mirror will enter the glass plate, incurring k <b>phase</b> <b>shift,</b> and then reflect off the mirror with no additional <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> since only air is now behind the mirror, and travel again back through the glass plate incurring an additional k <b>phase</b> <b>shift.</b>|$|R
