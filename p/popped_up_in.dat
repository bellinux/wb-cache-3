5|$|In {{the seventh}} inning, the Yankees faced a new pitcher, this time southpaw Bill Hallahan, {{who served as}} both a starter and {{reliever}} for the Cardinals. After Severeid singled and subsequently advanced on a sacrifice bunt by Hoyt, he scored on a double hit into left field by Combs. The Yankees led 10–4 and did not get any more runs or hits in the eighth or ninth inning. The Cardinals came up to bat {{in the bottom of}} the ninth inning with Hoyt trying to hold on to his six-run lead. Hornsby singled to right field and advanced to second base on the following play. He then ran home to score a run on a Les Bell single to center field. Hafey then <b>popped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> foul territory, and Severeid made the catch. The game ended with a 10–5 score. Waite Hoyt pitched a complete game, allowing two earned runs on 14 hits while striking out eight batters. The Cardinals' five pitchers combined to give up 10 Yankee runs and 14 hits. With the series tied at two games apiece, both teams anticipated Game5, which featured a rematch between Herb Pennock and Bill Sherdel.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} some {{specialised}} passes {{that can be used}} during a rugby game. The 'dive-pass' is a pass which is sometimes used by the scrum-half if they are unable to get into the correct position for a long pass. The player dives as they release the ball, resulting in a quick pass. A 'flick-pass' is similar to a standard pass except the ball is passed with a flick of the wrists, making it a faster pass but with less distance. The 'pop-pass' is a short pass where the ball is simply <b>popped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a small loop to a player. The 'gut-pass' is a pass straight into the stomach area of a player and is mostly used by the forwards when moving the ball back through a maul.|$|E
25|$|Hiroshi Hiraoka, {{who was in}} the United States {{studying}} engineering, {{introduced the}} game to his co-workers at Japan’s national railways in 1878. He and his co-workers created the first baseball team, the Shimbashi Athletic Club, and dominated other teams which <b>popped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Japan. However, it wasn't until 1896 when a team from Ichikō, the elite University of Tokyo preparatory school, defeated a team from the Yokohama Country & Athletic Club 29 to 4 that the sport took a dominant hold in Japanese popular culture. The match was the first recorded international baseball game in Asia. After that victory, several other universities in Japan adopted the sport, and it quickly spread throughout Japan. Since then, teams from Japan have traveled to learn from their American counterparts. Waseda University {{was one of the first}} teams to cross the ocean to improve their skills. In 1905, the team traveled to the United States, where it played college teams from around the country. Other universities in Japan made similar trips, and U.S. teams traveled to Japan to play.|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving the}} Tri State area, Roberts and Brown next <b>popped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Florida working for Eddie Graham’s Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF). After {{working their way}} up the ranks, the duo {{challenged}} for and won the top tag team title in the promotion, the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship, from the team of Dick Slater and Stan Vachon in March 1974. The Blonds ruled the tag team division over the summer of 1974 until dropping the gold to Dick Slater and Toru Tanaka in the fall (either September or October). After their run with the titles ended, the Blonds moved on to another territory, the most natural territory for the team – NWA Hollywood Wrestling in Los Angeles. The Gene and Mike LeBell territory saw Roberts and Brown win the NWA Americas Tag Team Championship four times between December 1974 and August 1975, defeating such teams as Victor Rivera and Louie Tillet, Porkchop Cash and S.D. Jones, John Tolos and Louis Tillet, and the promotion's biggest tag-team attraction Black Gorman and Goliath. During their time in Los Angeles, the Hollywood Blonds were also involved in an angle that saw the Los Angeles version of the NWA North American Tag Team Championship shift over to New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) as their main tag team title of that day. On August 1, 1975, reigning champions Antonio Inoki and Seiji Sakaguchi fought the Hollywood Blonds to a no contest, after which the titles were declared vacant. A rematch in Nagoya, Japan saw the Blonds win the North American Tag Team titles on September 22. On October 2, Inoki and Sakaguchi regained the titles and they became more or less exclusive to NJPW after that date.|$|E

25|$|Iowa {{started the}} second half with the ball but they would punt the ball to Wisconsin after three plays. Wisconsin {{would do the same}} as they punted the ball back to Iowa. The Hawkeyes drive the ball to the Badgers 35-yard line. On fourth-and-one, Iowa decided to go for it and failed as the Badgers defense stuffed the run up the middle. Still the Badgers {{struggled}} to move the ball on the Iowa defense and punted it back to the Hawkeyes. The Wisconsin punt was downed at the Iowa 1-yard line. On the first play, Iowa tried to pass out of their own end zone. The pass was intercepted by CB Darius Hillary at the Iowa 20-yard line. During that play Iowa starting QB Jake Rudock was injured and would not return to the game. On the very next play, Joel Stave connected with WR Jared Abbrederis on a 20-yard touchdown pass. Jared Abbrederis was injured on the touchdown catch and he would not return to the game. Iowa's backup QB C.J. Beathard would come in but failed to pick up a first down so they punted. Wisconsin tried to move the ball but two holding penalties forced them to punt. Wisconsin punting into the wind again forced a 23-yard punt and Iowa took over at their own 40-yard line. Iowa would again get into the red zone at the Wisconsin 12-yard line but once again they were forced to settle for a 29-yard field goal. Wisconsin would have the ball as the third quarter came to a close with the Badgers holding onto a slight 14–9 lead. The Badgers got to midfield put punted the ball back to the Hawkeyes. The Badgers would get pressure on the Iowa backup QB and forced a bad throw that hit off an Iowa helmet, <b>popped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the air and was intercepted by DE Pat Muldoon at the Iowa 25-yard line. Three plays later, RB James White scored on an 11-yard touchdown run. The Badgers defense would again force another Hawkeye punt. Wisconsin took over at their own 24-yard line and on the second play of the drive, James White broke loose for a 59-yard run down to the Iowa 17. The Iowa defense tried to hold Wisconsin but finally James White punched it in with a 2-yard touchdown run giving the Badgers a 28–9 lead. With about and three and a half minutes left in the game, Iowa would again drive into the Wisconsin red zone but failed on fourth down and the Badgers closed out the game with a kneel down.|$|E
500|$|Before he {{shot his}} own head-smashing scene, {{he spoke to}} Gaspar Noé and {{asked him how he}} had done a similar scene in his film Irréversible (2002). Crossing the line from romance to violence, the scene begins with the Driver and Irene kissing tenderly. What they share is really a goodbye kiss, as he then becomes a [...] "werewolf," [...] violently stomping the hit man's head in. Subsequently, Irene sees the Driver in a new light. Of this scene Refn said: Every movie has to have a hearta place where it defines itselfand in every movie I've made there's always a scene that does that. On Drive, {{it was hard for me}} to wrap my head around it. I {{realized}} I needed to show in one situation that driver is the hopelessly romantic knight, but he's also completely psychotic and is willing to use any kind of violence to protect innocence. But that scene was never written. As I was going along, it just kind of <b>popped</b> <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> March 2012, Interiors, an online journal that is concerned with the relationship between architecture and film, released an issue that discussed how space is used in this scene. The issue highlights Refn's use of constricted space and his way of creating a balance between romance and violence.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, Paul Bettany was {{the first}} actor to portray two main {{characters}} within the universe, voicing Tony Stark's artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. in the Iron Man and Avengers films, and portraying Vision in Avengers films and Captain America: Civil War. Stan Lee, creator or co-creator {{of many of the}} characters seen in the MCU, has cameo appearances in all of the feature films and television series. In Iron Fist, it is revealed his on-set photograph cameo in the Marvel Netflix series is as NYPD Captain Irving Forbush. His cameo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sees Lee appearing as an informant to the Watchers, discussing previous adventures that include Lee's cameos in other MCU films; he specifically mentions his time as a FedEx delivery man, referring to Lee's cameo in Captain America: Civil War. This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos, with writer and director James Gunn noting that [...] "people thought Stan Lee is [...] and that all of these cameos are part of him being a Watcher. So, Stan Lee as a guy who is working for the Watchers was something that I thought was fun for the MCU." [...] Feige added that Lee [...] "clearly exists, you know, above and apart from the reality of all the films.

[...] Furthermore, most of the first season DVD reviews were positive towards the series as being one of the best American comedy shows. In a DVD review by Bill Treadway for DVD Verdict, he called the show [...] "the best animated American comedy since The Simpsons, it is a claim I stand behind." [...] Treadway said the show is [...] "accessible to all" [...] that [...] "adults will enjoy the witty satire and sly in-jokes subtly inserted into every episode." [...] He also mentioned that [...] "children will love the bright colors, spunky pace, and lively characters" [...] and that [...] "parents will {{not have to worry about}} violence or crude humor." [...] Jason Bovberg of DVD Talk called SpongeBob SquarePants [...] "the coolest Saturday morning cartoon since the heyday of Warner Bros." [...] In a separate review for the season's DVD release, Bovberg [...] "highly recommended" [...] the set and wrote [...] "I love the show so much, I can't see any way around giving this one a recommendation." [...] Bovberg was particular on the exclusion of the pilot episode [...] "Help Wanted", saying [...] "But why is 'Help Wanted' missing? I suppose I'll have to buy a [...] "theme" [...] disc down the road to secure that one. Sigh." [...] Furthermore, he described it as [...] "the only disappointment of the set." [...] Ron J. Epstein, also from DVD Talk, said that the character of SpongeBob is [...] "one of the strangest cartoon characters I have ever had the pleasure to watch." [...] He said that [...] "Unlike most cartoons today, SpongeBob SquarePants caters to both a child and an adult audience." ...|$|E

60|$|These {{were fine}} facilities, pleasantries, ironies, all these luxuries of gossip and philosophies of London and of life, {{and they became}} quickly, between the pair, the common form of talk, Milly professing herself delighted to know that {{something}} was {{to be done with}} her. If the most remarkable woman in England was to do it, so much the better, and if the most remarkable woman in England had them both in hand together, why, what could be jollier for each? When she reflected indeed a little on the oddity of her wanting two at once, Kate had the natural reply that it was exactly what showed her sincerity. She invariably gave way to feeling, and feeling had distinctly <b>popped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> her on the advent of her girlhood's friend. The way the cat would jump was always, in presence of anything that moved her, interesting to see; visibly enough, moreover, for a long time, it hadn't jumped anything like so far. This, in fact, as we already know, remained the marvel for Milly Theale, who, on sight of Mrs. Lowder, found fifty links in respect to Susie absent from the chain of association. She knew so herself what she thought of Susie that she would have expected the lady of Lancaster Gate to think something quite different; the failure of which endlessly mystified her. But her mystification was the cause for her of another fine impression, inasmuch as when she {{went so far as to}} observe to Kate that Susan Shepherd--and especially Susan Shepherd emerging so uninvited from an irrelevant past--ought, by all the proprieties, simply to have bored Aunt Maud, her confidant agreed with her without a protest and abounded in the sense of her wonder. Susan Shepherd at least bored the niece--that was plain; this young woman saw nothing in her--nothing to account for anything, not even for Milly's own indulgence: which little fact became in turn to the latter's mind a fact of significance. It was a light on the handsome girl--representing more than merely showed--that poor Susie was simply as nought to her. This was, in a manner too, a general admonition to poor Susie's companion, who seemed to see marked by it the direction in which she had best most look out.|$|E
