However, {{by the end of}} June, the sale of Once A Week to a new publisher was in progress. Rather than serialising The Vicar in the magazine, Bradbury and Evans issued it in eleven monthly shilling numbers, running from July 1869 to May 1870. Trollope could not object to this mode of independent publication; but it was one that had fallen out of favour with the public, and Trollope suffered a loss of reputation and readership as a result. He also suffered a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> of £300, agreeing for reasons unspecified to accept only £2500 for the novel.|$|E

40|$|Non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> can be {{characterized}} as losses that are suffered by damaging goods or interests which have in themselves no economic price or value on a financial market. Examples are damage to goods with a primarily sentimental value, such as an album of wedding photos, pain and suffering as a result of physical injury, damage to personal reputation, or even the death of a person. Due to the fact that these goods or interests have no substantial or direct market value, non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> are often characterized as losses that cannot be undone with money. Rogers (2001, p. 246) defines non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> as “losses which are not damage to a person’s assets or wealth or income and which is are therefore incapable of being quantified in objective financial manner by reference to a market”. Tort law, however, generally recognizes non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> to some extent as losses that should be compensated with money...|$|R

25|$|Unless {{otherwise}} {{provided by}} the act or by the contract, the compensation shall {{be limited to the}} injury actually suffered and the interests which have been lost. Interests which could have been normally expected are deemed to be the interests which have been lost, according to the ordinary course of things, the decided projects, equipment, or other particular circumstances. A person who has wrongfully caused the death of another shall also be bound to make compensation for the injury to any person incurring the medical expenses, increasing the need in living, or incurring the funeral expenses. If the deceased was statutorily bound to furnish maintenance to a third party, the tortfeasor shall also make compensation to such third party for any injury arising therefrom. In case of death caused by a wrongful act, the father, mother, sons, daughters and spouse of the deceased may claim for a reasonable compensation in money even if such injury is not a purely <b>pecuniary</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} has wrongfully damaged to the body, health, reputation, liberty, credit, privacy or {{chastity}} of another, or to another's personality in a severe way, the injured person may claim a reasonable compensation in money even if such injury is not a purely <b>pecuniary</b> <b>loss.</b> If it was reputation that has been damaged, the injured person may also claim the taking of proper measures for the rehabilitation of his reputation. A person who, intentionally or negligently, has wrongfully damaged the rights of another is bound to compensate him for any injury arising therefrom. The same rule shall be applied when the injury is done intentionally in a manner against the rules of morals. A person, who violates a statutory provision enacted {{for the protection of}} others and therefore prejudice to others, is bound to compensate for the injury, except no negligence in his act can be proved. If several persons have wrongfully damaged the rights of another jointly, they are jointly liable for the injury arising therefrom. The same rule shall be applied even if which one has actually caused the injury cannot be sure. Instigators and accomplices are deemed to be joint tortfeasors.|$|E

As a result, the demand to repeal them became the greatest issue in his life.|$|R
2500|$|Thus, upon {{a review}} of the pre-1977 English and present-day Australian case law, the Court of Appeal {{concluded}} that special damage is not limited to actual <b>pecuniary</b> <b>loss,</b> and it is not required that the applicant alone has suffered damage. An applicant asserting a violation of a public right must show that his [...] "personal interests are directly and practically affected over and above the general class of persons who hold that right". The Court declined to offer more specific guidelines as the special damage requirement is necessarily fact sensitive, dependent on individual cases.|$|E

In March 2004, they accepted a US$3,000,000 settlement. [...] The much lower final settlement was still reportedly {{one of the largest in}} the City of New York for a single man with no dependents under New York State's [...] "wrongful death law", which limits damages to <b>pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> by the deceased person's next of kin.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the age of}} 16, Sharkey was {{connected}} with the leading story-papers of New York City and Philadelphia. From her childhood, she wrote stories and poems for amusement, and given many {{of them to the}} local press without thought of remuneration. She then decided that writing, which she had previously done for pastime, would be a method of support. She conceived and executed the scheme of starting a literary journal in New Orleans. It was a most unpropitious time and place for such an enterprise. A few months convinced the young journalist of that fact, and she discontinued it before her finances were exhausted. Though that journalistic venture was a large <b>pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> to her, it gave her such prestige that applications to become a regular contributor poured in from different publishers. The amount of literary work that she accomplished in a given time was extensive. For at least 10 years, she received a larger salary for her work than any other writer in the Deep South, and larger than any official in the state of Louisiana.|$|E

It {{has been said that}} the malicious intention of Tallemant's work may be partly attributed to his bourgeois extraction and that the slights he received are avenged in his pages, but independent testimony has established the substantial correctness of his statements. In 1685 he was converted to Catholicism. It seems that the change was not entirely disinterested, for Tallemant, who had suffered considerable <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses,</b> soon after received a pension of 2,000 livres.

5000|$|Promissory {{estoppel}} being a state action, the Fourteenth Amendment applies, {{and hence}} the First Amendment is triggered, citing New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964). However, since the state principle of promissory estoppel is a generally applicable principle, there is no specific application of the First Amendment to the press, over and above {{that of any other}} citizen, citing Associated Press v. NLRB (1937). Cohen had not used the promissory estoppel argument to avoid the hurdle of a libel case, but for identifiable <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses,</b> distinguishing the case from Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell (1988). Consequently, any restriction on reporting was [...] "incidental, and constitutionally insignificant" [...] result of applying a generally applicable law.|$|R

It is surprising, perhaps, that the money value of Great Britain's claim should be so little short of that of France and actually in excess of that of Belgium. But, measured either by <b>pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> or real loss to the economic power of the country, the injury to her mercantile marine was enormous.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the dynamic interaction between norms — internalized restraints on opportunistic behavior — and institutions — restraints on such behavior deriving from external enforcement. When individuals following a norm suffer <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> to doing so, the norm is eroded. Institutions, {{on the other}} hand, are strengthened when institution designers are rewarded for improving them. The dynamic interaction between these two factors leads to both good steady states with functioning institutions, widespread norm compliance, and trade, and bad steady states where trade breaks down, institutions are dysfunctional and beneficial norms are violated. The model here shows the situations that lead economies to converge on good steady states rather than bad ones; why countries {{with a history of}} institutional success {{are more likely to be}} successful in future, why countries with a history of failure will require better institutions to acheive even the same level of compliance, and why functional institutions may not be readily transplated from successful to unsuccessful countries...|$|R

It was not the threatened <b>pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> which was troubling her. As far as money was concerned, she could have lived comfortably on her savings, for she was richer than most of her friends supposed.

[...] As for the hoppers, they did not count.

Aristagoras continued the siege four months; but inasmuch as, during all this time, Megabates did every thing {{in his power to}} circumvent and thwart every plan that Aristagoras formed, nothing was accomplished. Finally, the expedition was broken up, and Aristagoras returned home, disappointed and chagrined, all his hopes blasted, and his own private finances thrown into confusion by the great <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> which he himself had sustained.

In a memorial presented to Congress at this time the losses in Jackson County were placed at $175,000, and {{in the state of}} Missouri at $2,000,000.

The Senate committee at Washington reported that the matter was entirely within the jurisdiction of the state of Missouri. One of the latest appeals was addressed by Smith at Nauvoo in December, 1843, to his native state, Vermont, calling on the Green Mountain boys, not only to assist him in attaining justice in Missouri, but also to humble and chastise or abase her for the disgraces she has brought upon constitutional liberty, until she atones for her sin.” ...|$|R
