To own to his marriage and consequent disqualification for the bequest was easy in itself; but it involved telling at least one man what both Viviette and himself had great reluctance in telling anybody.

6000|$|From {{the moment}} she {{suspected}} he might be thinking what Mona would say to his chattering so to an underhand [...] "companion," [...] who was all but paid, this young lady's repressed emotion began to require still more repression. She grew impatient of her situation at Poynton; she privately pronounced it false and horrid. She said to herself that she had let Owen know that she had, {{to the best of}} her power, directed his mother in the general sense he desired; that he quite understood it and that he also understood how unworthy it was of either of them to stand over the good lady with a notebook and a lash. Wasn't this practical unanimity just practical success? Fleda became aware of a sudden desire, as well as of <b>pressing</b> <b>reasons,</b> to bring her stay at Poynton to a close. She had not, on the one hand, like a minion of the law, undertaken to see Mrs. Gereth down to the train and locked, in sign of her abdication, into a compartment; neither had she on the other committed herself to hold Owen indefinitely in dalliance while his mother gained time or dug a counter-mine. Besides, people were saying that she fastened like a leech on other people--people who had houses where something was to be picked up: this revelation was frankly made her by her sister, now distinctly doomed to the curate and in view of whose nuptials she had almost finished, as a present, a wonderful piece of embroidery, suggested, at Poynton, by an old Spanish altar-cloth. She would have to exert herself still further for the intended recipient of this offering, turn her out for her marriage with more than that drapery. She would go up to town, in short, to dress Maggie; and their father, in lodgings at West Kensington, would stretch a point and take them in. He, to do him justice, never reproached her with profitable devotions; so far as they existed he consciously profited by them. Mrs. Gereth gave her up as heroically {{as if she had been}} a great bargain, and Fleda knew that she wouldn't at present miss any visit of Owen's, for Owen was shooting at Waterbath. Owen shooting was Owen lost, and there was scant sport at Poynton.|$|E
6000|$|I {{know the}} theory and {{practice}} of the Roman Church; but, being bred of another persuasion (and sceptical and heterodox regarding that), I can't help doubting the other, too, and wondering whether Catholics, in their confessions, confess all? Do we Protestants ever do so; and has education rendered those other fellow-men so different from us? At least, amongst us, we are not accustomed to suppose Catholic priests or laymen more frank and open than ourselves. Which brings me back to my question,--does any man confess all? Does yonder dear creature know all my life, who has been the partner of it for thirty years; who, whenever I have told her a sorrow, has been ready with the best of her gentle power to soothe it; who has watched when I did not speak, and when I was silent has been silent herself, or with the charming hypocrisy of woman has worn smiles and an easy appearance so as to make me imagine she felt no care, or would not even ask to disturb her lord's secret when he seemed to indicate a desire to keep it private? Oh, the dear hypocrite! Have I not watched her hiding the boys' peccadilloes from papa's anger? Have I not known her cheat out of her housekeeping to pay off their little extravagances; and talk to me with an artless face, as if she did not know that our revered captain had had dealings with the gentlemen of Duke's Place, and our learned collegian, {{at the end of his}} terms, had very <b>pressing</b> <b>reasons</b> for sporting his oak (as the phrase is) against some of the University tradesmen? Why, from the very earliest days, thou wise woman, thou wert for ever concealing something from me,--this one stealing jam from the cupboard; that one getting into disgrace at school; that naughty rebel (put on the caps, young folks, according to the fit) flinging an inkstand at mamma in a rage, whilst I was told the gown and the carpet were spoiled by accident. We all hide from one another. We have all secrets. We are all alone. We sin by ourselves, and, let us trust, repent too. Yonder dear woman would give her foot to spare mine a twinge of the gout; but, when I have the fit, the pain is in my slipper. At the end of the novel or the play, the hero and heroine marry or die, and so there is an end of them as far as the poet is concerned, who huzzas for his young couple till the postchaise turns the corner; or fetches the hearse and plumes, and shovels them underground. But when Mr. Random and Mr. Thomas Jones are married, is all over? Are there no quarrels at home? Are there no Lady Bellastons abroad? are there no constables to be outrun? no temptations to conquer us, or be conquered by us? The Sirens sang after Ulysses long after his marriage, and the suitors whispered in Penelope's ear, and he and she had many a weary day of doubt and care, and so have we all. As regards money I was put out of trouble by the inheritance I made: but does not Atra Cura sit behind baronets as well as equites? My friends in London used to congratulate me on my happiness. Who would not like to be master of a good house and a good estate? But can Gumbo shut the hall-door upon blue devils, or lay them always in a red sea of claret? Does a man sleep the better who has four-and-twenty hours to doze in? Do his intellects brighten after a sermon from the dull old vicar; a ten minutes' cackle and flattery from the village apothecary; or the conversation of Sir John and Sir Thomas with their ladies, who come ten moonlight muddy miles to eat a haunch, and play a rubber? 'Tis all very well to have tradesmen bowing to your carriage-door, room made for you at quarter-sessions, and my lady wife taken down the second or the third to dinner: but these pleasures fade--nay, have their inconveniences. In our part of the country, for seven years after we came to Warrington Manor, our two what they called best neighbours were my Lord Tutbury and Sir John Mudbrook. We are of an older date than the Mudbrooks; consequently, my Lady Tutbury always fell to my lot, when we dined together, who was deaf and fell asleep after dinner; or if I had Lady Mudbrook, she chattered with a folly so incessant and intense, that even my wife could hardly keep her complacency (consummate hypocrite as her ladyship is), knowing the rage with which I was fuming at the other's clatter. I come to London. I show my tongue to Dr. Heberden. I pour out my catalogue of complaints. [...] "Psha, my dear Sir George!" [...] says the unfeeling physician. [...] "Headaches, languor, bad sleep, bad temper--" [...] ("Not bad temper: Sir George has the sweetest temper in the world, only he is sometimes a little melancholy," [...] says my wife.)

Mining is usually done to produce construction material which is valued {{as much as}} 50% cheaper than other rocks, such as from quarries.

50|$|The siege now {{developed}} into a stalemate. The Moors were {{not strong enough to}} break out of Gibraltar, nor to assault the Castilians from the north across their ditch. They also did not have the naval power required to outflank the Castilians by sea or to break the naval blockade of Gibraltar, which was bringing the garrison close to starvation. The Castilians did not have the strength either to storm Gibraltar or to drive away Mohammad IV's troops on the Sierra Carbonera. Alfonso XI also received the news that three powerful nobles - Juan Núñez III de Lara, Juan Alfonso de Haro and Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena - had revolted against him and were ravaging the king's own lands.

50|$|However, other <b>pressing</b> <b>reasons</b> {{motivated}} them to action. Researchers {{estimate that}} only {{ten percent of}} barbarians such as Spanish and Gallic warriors had access to swords, usually the nobility. By contrast Dacia had rich resources of iron and copper and were prolific metal workers. A large percentage of Dacians owned swords, greatly reducing Rome's military advantage. Dacia sported 250,000 potential combatants, enough to enable an invasion. It was allied to several of its neighbors and on friendly terms with others that Rome considered enemies. Rome had no concrete defense policy {{and would not have}} been able to sustain a war of defense. As such, the new Emperor Trajan, himself an experienced soldier and tactician, began preparing for war. That Dacia was considered a substantial threat can be seen by the fact that Trajan withdrew troops from other borders leaving them dangerously undermanned.|$|E

5000|$|Diversity {{training}} {{can be defined}} as any program designed to facilitate positive intergroup interaction, reduce prejudice and discrimination, and generally teach individuals who are different from others how to work together effectively.

In the narrowest sense, it is education about compliance - Affirmative Action (AA), Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), and sexual harassment." [...] Diversity training is instruction aimed at helping participants to gain cultural awareness in order to benefit the organization or company. Diversity training is the reality that is facing many human resource management teams - one of the <b>pressing</b> <b>reasons</b> is the growing ethnic and racial diversity in the workplace. While major corporations believe that diversity training and active diversity hiring will assist them in remaining competitive in a global economy, other large organizations (universities and colleges) have been slow to embrace diversity training.|$|E

On 17 May the Duke concentrated his Dutch and English troops at Tongeren, near Maastricht.

Marlborough wrote {{an appeal to the}} Duke of Württemberg, the commander of the Danish contingent - [...] "I send you this express to request your Highness to bring forward by a double march your cavalry so as to join us at the earliest moment …" [...] Additionally, the King in Prussia, Frederick I, had kept his troops in quarters behind the Rhine while his personal disputes with Vienna and the States General at The Hague remained unresolved. Nevertheless, the Duke could think of no circumstances why the French would leave their strong positions and attack his army, even if Villeroi was first reinforced by substantial transfers from Marsin’s command. But in this he had miscalculated. Although Louis XIV wanted peace he wanted it on reasonable terms; for that, he needed victory in the field and to convince the Allies that his resources were by no means exhausted.|$|E
50|$|The United States Government Accountability Office {{attending}} the event {{found that there}} were manybig factors in why the meeting between all the countries ended with no agreements globally on anysingle of the issues brought forward. One pressing issue that angered the larger Developed Nations wasthe unwillingness of many developing countries to completely open their markets for free trade.Without this compromise, the United States and the European Nations felt no inclination to cut downSubsidies and help these developing countries economically without a fair agreement on trade. This wasa hard standoff, as both sides of the argument wanted to increase global trade with a more openmarket, but neither was willing to settle for less than what they wanted.Other large problems found by the Government Accountability Office included too much on the agendafor the amount of time they had, a lack of clear organization for the debates and lectures, and too manycountries trying to participate while constantly realigning themselves solely to seek a better outcome fortheir countries. No one had the intentions to try and strike deals with each other as a whole, ratherthere were many back door deals throughout the conference as countries tried to swindle aroundeveryone. Since 1986, the membership of this conference has risen by 90 participants to a total of 146members. This has caused a large dilemma of satisfying all countries’ needs. As many of the earlierparticipants have already satisfied many of the open trade requirements in their countries, many of thenewer countries are reluctant from abiding to the tariff abolition and free trade encouragement.One of the <b>pressing</b> <b>reasons</b> for this overwhelming movement was because this Cancun World TradeOrganization conference {{was the first time the}} world had met since they had created the DohaDevelopment Agenda. This agenda is designed to lower trading barriers and encourage a global trade on a much larger scale, with more of the smaller countries. With over two years since its creation, many countries had so manypressing issues they had hoped to bring forward into the conference, yet there was too little time for allof them to be considered. Many of them were also quite large ordeals, causing much unrest within thefour-day conference.|$|E

Caroline’s husband William had become an abusive alcoholic, and Sue tired of her husband’s malaise at home, as well as his drinking and gambling while away.

The article makes a distinction between what research reveals about the existence of racial bias in policing and perceptions of racially biased policing. Existing racial bias is not always accurately identified nor perceived, which makes it harder to enact change. Examining how to counteract its potential influence, it reviews empirically based interventions to address both police behavior and community perceptions regarding race in policing. From a policy perspective, the article considers the use of police body-worn cameras as a means to promote equitable policing. It concludes with recommendations based on scientific literature, arguing that effective policies must address both the perception of and actual biased policing...|$|R
