50|$|Sartre {{tells us}} that by acting <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>faith,</b> the waiter and the woman are denying their own freedom, by {{actively}} using this freedom itself.

50|$|<b>Bad</b> <b>faith</b> is {{important}} to the concept of original position in John Rawls' theory of justice, where mutual commitment of the parties requires that the parties cannot choose and agree to principles <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>faith,</b> <b>in</b> that they have to be able, not just to live with and grudgingly accept, but to sincerely endorse the principles of justice; a party cannot take risks with principles he knows he will have difficulty voluntarily complying with, or they would be making an agreement <b>in</b> <b>bad</b> <b>faith</b> which is ruled out by the conditions of the original position.|$|R
