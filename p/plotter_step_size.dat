The position and velocity updating calculation uses a pre-calculated table and hence the control of <b>step</b> <b>size</b> can not use the integration formulas for <b>step</b> <b>size</b> control.

This variable time <b>step</b> <b>size</b> method chooses the suitable time <b>step</b> <b>size</b> for each particle at each step automatically according to the conditions. Simulation using fixed time step method is compared with that of using variable time step method. The difference in computation time for the same accuracy using a variable <b>step</b> <b>size</b> (compared to the fixed step) depends on the particular problem. For a simple test case the times are roughly similar. However, the variable <b>step</b> <b>size</b> gives the required accuracy on the first run.
