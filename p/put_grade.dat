50|$|The Aliquippa Jr/Sr High School {{was built}} in 1959 as the Aliquippa Junior High School.

The school was built from 1958 to 1959 and was built to house 1,000 Students. The school was estimated to cost $750,000 to $850,000. The Junior High School was operated from 1959 to 1985, When by {{the decision of the}} Aliquippa School Board, The schools Grades would be realigned, Aliquippa`s population was declining due to the collapse of the steel industry, And the school district's enrollment dropped from 3,900 in 1973 to 1,500 that year. The School Board decided to <b>put</b> <b>grades</b> Kindergarten through Sixth in the then New Sheffield Elementary School (currently Aliquippa Elementary School), And <b>put</b> <b>grades</b> Seventh through Twelfth Grades at the Aliquippa High school, And renaming it Aliquippa Junior/Senior High School. Thus closing the over 30-year-old Junior High School. This remained until 1991 when due to a spike up in Enrollment, The Aliquippa School Board voted to reopen the Junior High School after being closed for 6 years. But in order to reopen the Junior High, The building had to be brought up to Code by the Regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Department of Education, County of Beaver, and the City of Aliquippa. After the work was finished the School was dedicated. A new air conditioning system, doors to the classrooms/building, new kitchen equipment, floors, lights, ceiling panels,paint, and a new main school entrance. The School was renamed Aliquippa Middle School and the school did not really change until 2008. When the Aliquippa School Board decided to once again realign the Grades, Aliquippa Elementary School will house grades Kindergarten through Sixth, And Aliquippa Middle School will house grades Seven through Twelfth and be renamed Aliquippa Junior/Senior High School. Aliquippa High School, built in 1924, would be demolished. The Class of 2009 was the last graduating class from the former Aliquippa High School.

40|$|The Perspectives on Ion Permeation {{center around}} the {{question}} of which approach is the most adequate in describing ion permeation. Obviously, one way to decide is to compare {{the outcome of the}} various models with experimental results and to let the range of validity and the model&# 39;s ability of prediction be the major judge in grading models. An obstacle in doing so has been the lack of standards for electrophysiological recordings. A well−maintained, widely accepted, public database of raw data of current−voltage (IV) recordings and related measurements that, with time, becomes more complete will significantly improve the endeavor of finding realistic descriptions of ion permeation. The idea of a public database is old and databases for protein structures and gene sequences have proven very useful. They act as interfaces in highly multidisciplinary scientific communities. There is a similar need for a database in this case, and there would be many advantages. Modeling of ion permeation can only become better with increasing diversity of a set of data, whereas approaches constrained by a reduced set of data are of limited use since missing experimental data could contain crucial information; a database will help to avoid redundancies and will <b>put</b> <b>grading</b> of different approaches on a firm basis, which, as a result, will spark competition. Public access to a collection of experimental results facilitates cross−talk between experiment and theory. The database, and therefore the scientific community, will profit from additional experimental results that may not be published as parts of peer−reviewed articles because they are spin−offs of bigger experimental projects. Fuzziness of experimental data or its reproducibility might pose a problem that could become manageable by very carefully defining the experiments. Another caveat is that the database has to be maintained by dedicated persons within a bigger organization. How to start to set up a database? After agreeing upon a data format, one could start to ask labs specialized in channel ion permeation to contribute existing raw data to a public database available via the World Wide Web (J. D. Lear: synthetic channels; B. Sakmann: AChR; J. P. Rosenbusch: porins; O. S. Andersen: gramicidin). Hopefully, other labs will join in volunteering to upload data. The first experience will help to formulate standards, or a ranking system for grading raw data based on quality and completeness. A minimal standard for accepting data should then be formulated. At some stage, "wish lists" might be set up. For example a theoretician might wish to get a set of experiments that contains: (a) recordings of IV curves at varying symmetrical and asymmetrical bath concentrations. (b) IV recordings with voltage ranges extending beyond the physiological voltage range of about ± 100 mV. Membrane potentials of, say, ± 200 mV should be possible to achieve. Some characteristic properties of channels for which electrostatic forces dominate can be observed only at higher potentials. (c) IV recordings of channels subject to bath solutions with varying combinations of ionic specie...|$|R

One of these ways is to sing and play our way through the canon of music history. For music majors this can be both daunting and pleasurable at the same time. Depending on the strengths of aural training and the performance areas of the students, these experiences are rewarding in varying degrees. Placing a performance demand on students in a history-based course, however, is tricky, for to <b>put</b> a <b>grade</b> to their work is usually not appropriate or fair, since performance {{is not one of the}} learning objectives of the course.

In some guide books, where many Germans have done the first ascent, the UIAA scale is used for those climbs, and where the first ascent is done by a Scandinavian, the Scandinavian scale is used. The only way to know how the climb is rated is to know the first ascentist is German or Scandinavian.
