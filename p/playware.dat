5000|$|Jessen and Lund {{argue that}} the <b>playware</b> {{is not so much}} the result of the {{appearance}} of digital technology as it is the result of many children (and adults) in modern society not having the necessary knowledge and skills needed to initiate games and play. Earlier generations of children inherited games and learned play skills from older peers when participating in cross-age activities, for instance on the street or in the backyard. This is not to the same extent the case today and according to Jessen and Lund this has led to the need for inspiration from <b>playware.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the concept of remixing <b>playware,</b> which allows sampling and remixing of both physical and functional (e. g. music content) aspects of a system. Such remixing <b>playware</b> {{has a number of}} distinguished features which are explained in the paper: user-configurable modularity, which allows the user to interact and manipulate with samples; user-guided behavior-based system, which allows music compositions to emerge from the way performer interacts with the instruments that provide the primitive behaviours; intelligent sampling as the ability of creating samples that allow anybody to remix with the samples ensuring an engaging outcome. The paper exemplifies remixing <b>playware</b> with a variety of implementations in RoboMusic concerts, the virtual MusicTiles app, the physical MagicCubes, the physical dices in Peter Gabriel concerts, and the S'n'S system. These examples focus on music creation and performance, based upon the concept of RoboMusic, and it is argued that the concept of remixing <b>playware</b> extends to many other application areas of <b>playware...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{propose a}} novel <b>playware</b> as a merge between exergames and mobile fitness apps {{to engage the}} users in {{physical}} exercises, not only as competitive play, {{but also in the}} form of cooperative play. The concept connects modular interactive tiles with radio communication to Android tablets and smart phones, which can connect to the Internet. This allows the players to monitor their <b>playware</b> exergaming performance on the smart device(s). A test was set up over 8 days allowing two school classes to compete with each other on which class was going to collect the most points playing on the modular tiles during the test. The test subjects were from 6 th and 7 th grade (12 - 13 years old children). As a social <b>playware,</b> we investigated how the <b>playware</b> mediated cooperative and competitive play amongst the users. It was found that the majority of game play involved social interaction between players, and that 8 out of 10 pupils on the top- 10 were girls. The <b>playware</b> seemed to motivate the girls to become physically active...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an approach}} on how versatile, dynamic and adaptive playgrounds {{can be developed}} using multi-agent systems (MAS), artificial intelligence (AI) and <b>Playware</b> technology. By modelling {{the children and the}} <b>Playware</b> playground into a MAS, knowledge about the children’s favourite playing behaviour can be acquired. Experiments with children were conduced in order to record their playing behaviours on the <b>Playware</b> playground, which consists of tiles capable of sensing and actuation, and having abilities to communicate with neighbouring tiles. An ANN capable of classifying the children’s behaviour within eleven categories (i. e. favourite playing behaviour) was trained using a subgroup of the children. Validating the ANN against the remaining children’s behaviours, 93 % were correctly classified. An adaptive playground was implemented utilizing the ANN in classifying the children’s behaviour real-time and thus allowing for the children’s interest in the playground to be maintained and/or increased by using appropriate adaptation strategies. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} {{the design of}} modular robotic objects that may enhance playful experiences. The {{approach}} builds upon the development of modular robotics to create a kind of <b>playware,</b> which is flexible in both set-up and activity building for the end-user to allow easy creation of games. Key features of this design approach are modularity, flexibility, and construction, immediate feedback to stimulate engagement, activity design by end-users, and creative exploration of play activities. These features {{permit the use of}} such modular <b>playware</b> by a vast array of users, including disabled children who often could be prevented from using and taking benefits from modern technologies. The objective is to get any children moving, exchanging, experimenting and having fun, regardless of their cognitive or physical ability levels. The paper describes two prototype systems developed as modular robotic tiles, and discusses the challenges and opportunities of this modular <b>playware</b> when used by children with different cognitive abilities...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} for capturing and modeling individual entertainment (“fun”) preferences {{is applied to}} users of the innovative <b>Playware</b> playground, an interactive physical playground inspired by computer games, in this study. The goal is to construct, using representative statistics computed from children’s physiological signals, an estimator {{of the degree to}} which games provided by the playground engage the players. For this purpose children’s heart rate (HR) signals, and their expressed preferences of how much “fun” particular game variants are, are obtained from experiments using games implemented on the <b>Playware</b> playground. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that children’s reported entertainment preferences correlate well with specific features of the HR signal. Neuro-evolution techniques combined with feature set selection methods permit the construction of user models that predict reported entertainment preferences given HR features. These models are expressed as artificial neural networks and are demonstrated and evaluated on two <b>Playware</b> games and two control tasks requiring physical activity. The best network is able to correctly match expressed preferences in 64 % of cases on previously unseen data (p−value 6 · 10 − 5). The generality of the methodology, its limitations, its usability as a real-time feedback mechanism for entertainment augmentation and as a validation tool are discussed. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This report {{presents}} preliminary physical control experiments for capturing {{and modeling}} the affective state of entertainment — that is, whether {{people are having}} “fun ” — of users of the innovative <b>Playware</b> playground, an interactive physical playground. The goal is to construct, using representative statistics computed from children’s physiological hear rate (HR) signals, an estimator {{of the degree to}} which games provided by the playground engage the players. For this purpose children’s HR signals, and their expressed preferences of how much “fun” particular game variants are, are obtained from experiments using games implemented on the <b>Playware</b> playground. Neuro-evolution techniques combined with feature set selection methods permit the construction of user models that predict reported entertainment preferences given HR features. These models are expressed as artificial neural networks and are demonstrated and evaluated on two <b>Playware</b> games and the preliminary control task requiring physical activity. Results demonstrate that the proposed preliminary control experiment is not an appropriate control for physical activity effects since it may generate HR dynamics rather easy to separate from game-play HR dynamics, and allows one to distinguish entertaining game-play from exercise purely on the artificial basis of the kind of physical activity taking place. Conclusions derived from this study constitute the basis for the design of more appropriate control experiments and user models in future studies...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a multi-agent system (MAS) approach for modelling social behaviours in children’s play. The children, {{the dynamics of}} their play, and the playground are modelled into a MAS following the VOWELS [2] paradigm; thus, modelling the children as the agents, the playground as the environment, and the dynamics of their play as the interactions and organization. Utilizing the <b>Playware</b> playground [8, 9] as the environment, an interface to the environment can be defined, which allows us to formally model {{the children and the}} dynamics of their play (i. e. their individual and social behaviour) as populations and organizations in accordance with the PopOrg [3] paradigm. The MAS model has been used to design an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture capable of classifying social behaviours within appropriate categories. Experiments with children have been performed, and data recorded from the <b>Playware</b> playground during the experiments has been used to train the ANN. The ANN has been validated according to an external observer to correctly classify 70 % of the social behaviours observed during the experiments. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} {{constructing}} a metric {{of the degree}} to which a player enjoys a given game has been presented previously. In this paper, we attempt to construct such metric models of children’s ‘fun ’ when playing the Bug Smasher game on the <b>Playware</b> platform. First, a set of numerical features derived from a child’s interaction with the <b>Playware</b> hardware is presented. Then the Sequential Forward Selection and the n-Best feature selection algorithms are employed together with a function approximator based on an artificial neural network to construct feature sets and function that model the child’s notion of ‘fun ’ for this game. Performance of the model is evaluated by the degree to which the preferences predicted by the model match those expressed by the children in a survey experiment. The results show that an effective model can be constructed using these techniques and that the Sequential Forward Selection method performs better in this task than n-Best. The model reveals differing preferences for game parameters between children who react fast to game events and those who react slowly. The limitations and the use of the methodology as an effective adaptive mechanism to entertainment augmentation are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Several sub-disciplines of {{engineering}} {{are driven by}} the researchers ’ aim of providing positive change to the society through their engineering. These researchers are challenged by the traditional research method of experimental research with a waterfall model which demands clearly defined project definition and functional requirements, and impose a sequential processes leading to the final system evaluation, which may lead to solutions which work in the lab, but have little impact in the messy real world. Based on two decades research in developing engineering systems with a societal impact (e. g. in robotics, embodied AI, and <b>playware),</b> {{in this paper we}} suggest a cyclic research method based on a mix between participatory and experimental processes. In particular, inspiration from the action research method applied to interdisciplinary technology development becomes a participatory approach characterized by rapid prototyping cycles which allow iterative technology specification and development together with people in their real world environment...|$|E
