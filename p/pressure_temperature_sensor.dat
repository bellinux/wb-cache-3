40|$|Closed and {{pressure}} regulated fermentation systems with no gas inlets appear in many farming, medical and industrial applications. However, many of such systems still lack {{the capacity to}} obtain a complete profile of the gas production pattern {{or the ability to}} provide parameters that describe the patterns of gas production. Consequently, these models do not exploit the full potential for providing insights into the attributes of the resulted fermentation patterns. To date still there is no rigorous presentation that includes the outputs from gas, <b>pressure</b> and <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors,</b> while considering the effect of vented gases. Here, we introduce a versatile and scalable fermentation model for describing gas production processes. This new model uses a novel mass-flow equation for comprehensive profiling of the gases produced. The performance of this model is demonstrated by revealing the gas kinetic patterns that resulted when fecal matter, together with highly fermentable fiber, was incubated in an in-vitro system. The new model shows differences of up to 7 % and 9. 1 % in cumulative gas production and gas production rate, respectively, with respect to existing methods The model provides the first comprehensive solution for gas production profiling by accurately taking into account the measured data from gas, <b>pressure</b> and <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> for common fermentation systems that can potentially be of great importance for analyzing incubation units...|$|R
