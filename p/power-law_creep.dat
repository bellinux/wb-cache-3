Numerical results for two-dimensional cell analyses involving many grains are presented which demonstrate that random microstructural variations relative to an array of regular hexagonal grains invariably lead to an increase of the creep rate enhancement due to sliding. For <b>power-law</b> <b>creeping</b> grains and for the variations considered here, the effects amount to up to a 60 % increase.

40|$|Three {{models of}} <b>power-law</b> <b>creep</b> are {{frequently}} presented. Those of Weertman assume distributed sources of dislocations which spread until they meet dislocations from other sources. They then annihilate by bulk diffusion. If {{the density of}} sources is independent of stress, a 9 / 2 power law follows, but the creep rate is grossly less than that observed. Moreover, the more plausible assumption of a source density proportional to the cube of the stress leads to the conventional power law of 3. The model of Spingarn and Nix assumes dislocation glide with pile-ups at the grain boundaries. These cause steps on the boundaries, which are removed by grain-boundary diffusion. A fifth power law follows. The agreement in absolute creep rate shown in the original paper arises from a misreading of the tabulated data, and the true predicted creep rate is again far too low. Vacancy diffusion along dislocation cores {{in the interior of}} the grains is not likely to dominate grain-boundary diffusion, because the cross section of the dislocation network exceeds that of the grain boundary material only at large grain sizes. While Mecking and Estrin have shown that the vacancy concentration produced mechanically even in dislocation cell walls is likely to exceed that in thermal equilibrium only below 1 / 2 Tm, it seems possible that the highly mobile interstitials produced mechanically may migrate along dislocations of secondary glide systems to allow vacancy and interstitial dipoles of the primary system to annihilate mutually, with a probable power law of 5. However, the observations of Andrade and of Hanson, which may apply to the regime of power-law breakdown rather than <b>power-law</b> <b>creep,</b> strongly indicate that deformation is localized at the grain boundaries.

Factors or parameters believed to be directly related to the observed characteristic deformation modes leading to failure under in-service loading conditions are identified, and subsequently investigated using the cylindrical version of the higher-order theory for functionally graded materials in conjunction with the Robinson's unified viscoplasticity theory and the <b>power-law</b> <b>creep</b> model for modeling the response of the liner s constituents. Configurations are analyzed in which specific modifications in cooling channel wall thickness or constituent materials are made to determine the influence of these parameters on the deformations resulting in the observed failure modes in the outer walls of the cooling channel. The application of thermal barrier coatings and functional grading are also investigated within this context. Comparison of the higher-order theory results based on the Robinson and <b>power-law</b> <b>creep</b> model predictions has demonstrated that, using the available material parameters, the <b>power-law</b> <b>creep</b> model predicts more precisely the experimentally observed deformation leading to the 'dog-house' failure mode for multiple short cycles, while also providing much improved computational efficiency.

Based on the velocity-depth model along Profile OBH- 4 across the Xisha Trough, a seven-layer density-depth model is used to estimate density structure for the profile. The relationship between seismic velocity and radiogenic heat production is used to estimate the vertical distribution of heat sources in the lower crust. The 2 -D temperature field is calculated by applying a 2 -D numerical solution of the heat conduction equation and the thermal lithosphere thickness is obtained from the basalt dry solidus (BDS). The rheology of the profile is estimated {{on the basis of}} frictional failure in the brittle regime and <b>power-law</b> steady-state <b>creep</b> in the ductile regime. Rheological model is constructed for a three-layer model involving a granitic upper crust, a quartz diorite lower crust and an olivine upper mantle. Gravity modeling supports basically the velocity-depth model. The Moho along Profile OBH- 4 is of relatively high heat flow ranging from 46 to 60 mW/m(2) and the Moho beat flow is higher in the trough than on the flanks, The depth of the "thermal" lithospheric lower boundary is about 54 km in the center, deepens toward two sides, and is about 75 km at the northern slope area and about 70 kin at the southern Xisha-Zhongsha Block. Rheological calculation indicates that the two thinnest ductile layers in the crust and the thickest brittle layer in the uppermost mantle lie in the central region, showing that the Xisha Trough has been rheologically strengthened, which are mainly due to later thermal relaxation.

The resulting integral equations for the detected relaxation and <b>creep</b> <b>power-laws,</b> of exponent β, are characterized by fractional operators. Here strains in SBVloc are considered to account for time-like jumps. Consis-tently, starting from stresses in Lrloc, r ∈ [1, β− 1], β ∈ (0, 1) we reconstruct the corresponding strain by extending a result in [42]. The “minimal ” state is explored by showing that different histories delivering the same response are such that the fractional derivative of their difference is zero for all times. This equation is solved through a one-parameter family of strains whose related stresses converge to the response characterizing the original problem. This provides an approximation formula for the state variable, namely the resid-ual stress associated to the difference of the histories above. Very {{little is known about}} the microstructural origins of the detected power-laws. Recent rheological models, based on a top-plate adhering and moving on functionally graded microstructures, allow for showing that the resultant of the underlying “microstresses ” matches the action recorded at the top-plate of such models, yielding a relationship between the macroscopic state and the “microstresses”. 1.

This model has a jamming or yielding phase transition, around which <b>power-law</b> or Andrade <b>creep</b> is found. During primary creep, the relative strength of the strain rate fluctuations increases with time in both cases - the spatially averaged creep rate obeys the Andrade law ϵ_t ∼ t^- 0. 7, while the time dependence of the spatial fluctuations of the local creep rates is given by Δϵ_t ∼ t^- 0. 5. A similar scaling for the fluctuations is found in the logarithmic creep regime that is typically observed for lower applied stresses. We review briefly some classical theories of Andrade creep {{from the point of view}} of such spatial fluctuations. We consider these phenomenological, time-dependent creep laws in terms of a description based on a non-equilibrium phase transition separating evolving and frozen states of the system when the externally applied load is varied.

40|$|During ice-structure interaction, ice {{will fail}} in a brittle manner {{dominated}} by two processes. The first {{corresponds to the}} formation of macrocracks and the consequent spalling-off of large ice pieces. The second includes and intense shear-damage process in zones, termed critical zones, where high pressures are transmitted to the structure. The shear-damage process results in microstructural changes including microcrack formation and recrystallization. A range of tests on laboratory-prepared granular ice have been conducted to determine the fundamental behaviour of ice under various stress states and stress history, particularly as it relates to changes of microstructure. The test series was designed to study three aspects: the intrinsic creep properties of intact, undamaged ice; the enhancement of creep and changes in microstructure due to damage; and the effects of different stress paths. Tests on intact ice with triaxial confining pressures and deviatoric stresses, aimed at defining the intrinsic creep response in the absence of microcracking, showed that an accelerated creep rate occurred at relatively low deviatoric stresses. Hence, a minimum creep rate occurred under these conditions. Recrystallization to a smaller grain-size and void formation were observed. Ice damaged uniaxially and triaxially prior to testing showed enhancement of creep under both uniaxial and triaxial loading conditions. Creep rates in triaxially damaged ice were found to ben non-linear with high deviatoric stresses, corresponding to a <b>power-law</b> dependence of <b>creep</b> rate. Uniaxially damaged specimens contained microcracks parallel to the stressed direction which tended to close under triaxial confinement. Damage under triaxial conditions at low confining presses produced small recrystallized grains near zones of microcracking. At high confining pressures, a fine-grained recrystallized structure with no apparent cracking was observed uniformly across the specimen. The recrystallization process contributes significantly to the enhanced creep rates. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDifferent {{batches of}} {{austenitic}} stainless steels (316 LN) are subjected to numerous creep tests carried out at various stresses and temperatures between 525 °C to 750 °C up to nearly 50 • 103 h. Interrupted creep tests show an acceleration of the creep deformation only during the last 15 % of creep lifetime which corresponds to macroscopic necking. The modeling of necking using the Norton flow law allows lifetime predictions in fair agreement with experimental data up to a few thousand hours only. In fact, the experimental results show that, the extrapolation of the ‘stress – lifetime’ curves obtained at high stress leads to large overestimations of lifetimes at low stress. After FEG–SEM observations, these overestimates are mainly due to additional intergranular cavitation along grain boundaries as often observed in many metallic materials. The modeling of cavity growth by vacancy diffusion along grain boundaries coupled with continuous nucleation proposed by Riedel is carried out. For each specimen, ten FEG–SEM images (about 250 observed grains) are analyzed to determine the rate of cavity nucleation assumed to be constant during each creep test in agreement with many literature results. This constant rate is the only measured parameter which is used as input of the Riedel model. Lifetimes for long term creep are rather fairly well predicted by either the necking model or the Riedel model with respect to experimental lifetimes up to 200000 hours for temperatures between 525 °C and 700 °C. A transition {{time as well as}} a transition stress is defined by the intersection of the lifetime curves based on the necking and Riedel modellings. This is due to a change in damage mechanism. The scatter in lifetimes predicted by the Riedel model induced by the uncertainly of some parameter values is around 50 %. This model is also validated for martensitic steels (Lim et al., 2011.) and for other austenitic SSs 304 H, 316 H, 321 H (creep rupture data provided by Dr. F. Abe, NIMS). A transition from <b>power-law</b> to viscous <b>creep</b> behavior is reported in the literature at 650 °C– 750 °C. It allows us to predict even better lifetimes up to 200000 hours at very high temperature...|$|R
40|$|Chemomechanical {{coupling}} in single eukaryotic animal cells is investigated in the con- {{text of the}} attached (substratum-adhered) and the suspended (free-floating) states. These dichotomous configurations determine behavioral differences and commonalities relevant to therapeutic reimplantation of stem cells and to our general under- standing of the cell as an animate material. Analytical, simulation, and experimental techniques are applied to key questions including: (1) How deep can mechanosensitive attached cells "feel" into the adjacent environment? (2) In what manner do suspended cells deform, absent the prominent actomyosin stress fibers that arise upon attachment to a rigid substratum? (3) What explains the remarkable mechanical heterogeney among single cells within a population? (4) Can we leverage putative mechanical markers of useful stem cells to sort them before reimplantation in tissue generation therapies? Attached cells are found to barely detect an underlying rigid base more than 10 micrometers {{below the surface of}} a compliant coating. This conclusion, based on ex- tensions to the Boussinesq problem of elasticity theory, is validated by observations of cell morphology on compliant polyacrylamide coatings in a range of thicknesses. Analytical equations are developed for estimating the effective stiffness sensed by a cell atop a compliant layer. We also identify and consider conceptualizations of a "critical thickness," representing the minimum suitable thickness for a specific application. This parameter depends on the cell behavior of interest; the particular case of stem cell culture for paracrine extraction is presented as a case study. Suspended cells are found to exhibit no single characteristic time scale during de- formation; rather, they behave as power-law (or "soft glassy") materials. Here, optical stretching is used as a non-contact technique to show that stress fibers and probe-cell contact are not critical in enabling power-law rheological behavior of cells. Further- more, suspended cell fluidity, as characterized by both the hysteresivity of complex modulus and the <b>power-law</b> exponent of <b>creep</b> compliance, is found to be unaffected by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, showing that ATP hydrolysis is not the origin of fluidity in cells during deformation. However, ATP depletion does reduce the natural variation in hysteresivity values among cells. This finding, and the finding that changes in the power-law exponent and stiffness of single cells are correlated upon repeated loading, motivates study of how and why these parameters are coupled. To further explore this coupling, chemomechanical cues are applied to cell populations to elucidate the origin of the wide, right-skewed distribution of stiffness values that is consistently observed. The distribution and width are found to be not detectably dependent on cell-probe contact, cell lineage, cell cycle, mechanical perturbation, or fixation by chemical crosslinking. However, ATP depletion again reduces heterogeneity, now in the case of cell stiffness values. It is further found analytically that a postulated Gaussian distribution of power-law exponent values leads naturally to the log-normal distribution of cell stiffness values that is widely observed. Based on these connections, a framework is presented to improve our understanding of the appearance of mechanical heterogeneity in successively more complex assemblies of cell components. Two case studies are described to explore the implications of unavoidable intrinsic variation of cell stiffness in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Finally, all the single-cell mechanical parameters studied so far (stiffness during creep and recovery, stiffness heterogeneity among cells, and <b>power-law</b> exponents in <b>creep</b> and recovery) are characterized in mesenchymal stem cells during twenty population doublings with the aim of developing a high-throughput sorting tool. How- ever, mechanical and structural changes that are observed in the attached state during this culture time are not observed after cell detachment from the substratum. The absence in the suspended state of these alterations indicates that they manifest themselves through stress fiber arrangement rather than cortical network arrangement. While optical stretching under the present approach does not detect mechanical markers of extended passaging that are correlated with decreased differentiation propensity, the technique is nevertheless found capable of investigating another structural transition: mechanical stiffening over tens of minutes after adherent cells are suspended. This previously unquantified transition is correlated with membrane resorption and reattachment to the cortex as the cell "remodels" after substratum detachment. Together, these quantitative studies and models of attached and suspended cells de- fine the extremes of the extracellular environment while probing mechanisms that con- tribute to cellular chemomechanical response. An integration of the results described above shows that no one existing model can describe cell chemomechanics. However, the cell can be usefully described as a material [...] one in which animate mechanisms such as active contraction will generally, but not invariably, need to be considered as augmenting existing viscoelastic theories of inanimate matter. by John Mapes Maloney.
