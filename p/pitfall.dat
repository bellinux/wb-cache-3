5|$|Another {{potential}} protocarnivorous <b>pitfall</b> trap is {{a species}} of teasel, Dipsacus fullonum, which has been only suggested as a possible carnivore. Only one major study has examined D. fullonum for carnivory and no evidence of digestive enzymes or foliar nutrient absorption was revealed.|$|E
5|$|A protocarnivorous plant (sometimes also paracarnivorous, subcarnivorous, or {{borderline}} carnivore), {{according to}} some definitions, traps and kills insects or other animals but lacks the ability to either directly digest or absorb nutrients from its prey like a carnivorous plant. The morphological adaptations such as sticky trichomes or <b>pitfall</b> traps of protocarnivorous plants parallel the trap structures of confirmed carnivorous plants.|$|E
5|$|Drymoreomys albimaculatus {{appears to}} be a {{specialist}} of dense, moist, montane and premontane forest. It has been found in disturbed and secondary forests as well as in pristine forest, but probably needs contiguous forest to survive. Reproductive activity has been observed in females in June, November, and December and in males in December, suggesting that the species breeds year-round. Although some of its morphological traits, such as the very large pads, are suggestive of arboreal (tree-dwelling) habits, most specimens were collected in <b>pitfall</b> traps on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Nepenthes rajah is a {{carnivorous}} plant of the <b>pitfall</b> trap variety. It {{is famous for}} occasionally trapping vertebrates, even small mammals. There exist at least two records of drowned rats found in N. rajah pitchers. The first observation dates from 1862 and was made by Spenser St. John, who accompanied Hugh Low on two ascents of Mount Kinabalu. In 1988, Anthea Phillipps and Anthony Lamb confirmed the plausibility of this record when they managed to observe drowned rats in a large pitcher of N. rajah. In 2011, {{the discovery of a}} drowned mountain treeshrew (Tupaia montana) in a N.rajah pitcher was reported.|$|E
5|$|Other {{cultural}} controls {{may be used}} {{in combination}} with crop rotation: Mulching the potato crop with straw early in the growing season may reduce the beetle’s ability to locate potato fields, and the mulch creates an environment that favours beetle's predators; Plastic-lined trenches have been used as <b>pitfall</b> traps to catch the beetles as they move toward a field of potatoes in the spring, exploiting their inability to fly immediately after emergence; Flamethrowers may also be used to kill the beetles when they are visible {{at the top of the}} plant's foliage.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} usually {{straightforward}} to identify. The white-rumped swift {{is similar to}} Pacific swift, but its slender body and long, deeply forked tail make it appear quite different from its more powerfully built relative. A possible <b>pitfall</b> is a partially leucistic common swift with a white rump. The Pacific swift can be distinguished with care by its deeper tail fork, longer wings, bigger head, larger white throat patch and patterned underparts. In parts of Southeast Asia, migrating Pacific swifts pass through the resident ranges of former subspecies, and good views are then necessary {{to be sure of}} correct identification.|$|E
60|$|<b>Pitfalls</b> {{are often}} dug in great numbers, near frequented watering-places, to which {{numerous}} intersecting paths lead: by stopping up particular paths, the <b>pitfalls</b> {{can be brought}} separately into use; therefore, those <b>pitfalls</b> need never be employed in which animals have been freshly killed, and where the smell of blood would scare the game. It is difficult to prevent the covers of <b>pitfalls</b> becoming hollow: the only way is to build the roofs in somewhat of an arch, so as to allow for subsidence. If a herd of animals be driven over <b>pitfalls,</b> some are sure to be pushed in, as the crush {{makes it impossible for}} the beasts, however wary, to pick their way.|$|R
30|$|Awareness of {{diagnostic}} <b>pitfalls</b> {{is important to}} avoid both false-positive and false-negative interpretations. A systematic approach to mpMRI of the prostate using PI-RADS v. 2 helps {{in the identification of}} PCa, but there still remains a wide spectrum of <b>pitfalls.</b> These can be broadly split into two main groups: (1) <b>pitfalls</b> related to clinical indications and (2) technical and physiological artefacts (Table 1).|$|R

5|$|Another <b>pitfall</b> trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to produce at least one digestive enzyme and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is able to attract and kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, but so far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. The same could be said for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Choice is a {{significant}} aspect of the game, requiring a non-linear design to accommodate the customized characters. Level design began {{with a list of}} factors such as Disciplines, stealth and feats. Each area had to be viable for a shooting character (sufficient ammunition), a discipline-focused character (sufficient blood sources to keep the powers fueled) and a melee specialist (to reach enemies without being killed), with stealth options and option combinations. Level design began with a focus on stealth, taking into consideration the positioning of guards and the character's potential stealth capability at that point in the game. Then direct, combat-heavy and dialog paths were added. The amusement arcade area was to feature playable versions of Activision arcade games such as <b>Pitfall!,</b> though the idea was abandoned due to time constraints.|$|E
5|$|Subfossil {{deposits}} and midden remains {{suggest that the}} huia was once widespread in both lowland and montane native forest throughout the North Island, extending from the northernmost tip at Cape Reinga to Wellington and the Aorangi Range in the far south. Only a few huia are known from the extensive <b>pitfall</b> deposits in the karst of the Waitomo Caves area and they are also rare or absent in fossil deposits in the central North Island and Hawke's Bay; {{it seems to have}} preferred habitats that are not well sampled by the deposits known at present. Its range appears to have contracted following Māori settlement in the middle 12th century. By the time of European settlement in the 1840s, the bird was found only in the forests of the southern North Island, south of a line from the Raukumara Range in the east, across the Kaimanawa Range, to the Turakina River in the Rangitikei in the west. In the south, its range extended to the Wairarapa and the Rimutaka Range east of Wellington. Reports collected by Walter Buller and a single waiata (Māori song) suggest that the huia was once also found in the Marlborough and Nelson districts of the South Island; however, it has never been identified in the rich fossil deposits south of Cook Strait, and there is no other evidence of the species' presence.|$|E

40|$|Electrodiagnostic {{testing is}} used widely {{for the full}} {{characterization}} of neuromuscular disorders and for providing unique information on the processes underlying the pathology of peripheral nerves and muscles.

25|$|After High Rollers was {{cancelled}} in 1980, Trebek {{moved on}} to Battlestars for NBC. The series debuted in October 1981, and was cancelled in April 1982 after only six months on the air. In September 1981 Trebek took {{the helm of the}} syndicated <b>Pitfall,</b> which taped in Vancouver and forced him to commute, as he had done while hosting High Rollers and The $128,000 Question in 1978. <b>Pitfall</b> was cancelled after its production company, Catalena Productions, went bankrupt. As a result, he was never paid for that series. After both series ended, Trebek hosted a revival of Battlestars called The New Battlestars that ended after thirteen weeks, then shot a series of pilots for other series for producers Merrill Heatter (for whom he had worked hosting High Rollers and Battlestars) and Merv Griffin. The Heatter pilots were Malcolm, an NBC-ordered pilot featuring Trebek with an animated character as his co-host, and Lucky Numbers, an attempt at a revival of High Rollers that failed to sell. For Griffin, he shot two pilots for a revival of Jeopardy! This revival sold; he began hosting the revival in 1984 and has hosted ever since.|$|E

30|$|Nonetheless, the {{interpretation}} of mpMRI of the prostate can be challenging and new radiological skills are needed, especially when potential <b>pitfalls</b> (i.e., normal anatomic structures, benign conditions of the prostate or artefacts due to technical issues) might be erroneously interpreted as pathological conditions.

25|$|Like most Nepenthes species, N. jacquelineae is {{primarily}} insectivorous, {{although it does}} occasionally catch other types of invertebrates. The pitcher fluid of N. jacquelineae is extremely viscous and coats the pitcher walls. It {{has been suggested that}} the pitchers of this species function not only as <b>pitfall</b> traps but also as flypaper traps, with the sticky inner walls trapping flying insects above the surface of the fluid. Indeed, this trapping method is employed by the closely related N. inermis, which also produces highly viscous pitcher fluid.|$|E
25|$|A passive trap, <b>pitfall</b> traps attract prey with nectar bribes {{secreted}} by the peristome {{and bright}} flower-like anthocyanin patterning within the pitcher. The linings of most pitcher plants {{are covered in}} a loose coating of waxy flakes which are slippery for insects, causing them {{to fall into the}} pitcher. Once within the pitcher structure, digestive enzymes or mutualistic species break down the prey into an absorbable form for the plant. Water can become trapped within the pitcher, making a habitat for other flora and fauna. This type of 'water body' is called a Phytotelma.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pitfall</b> trap {{has evolved}} {{independently}} {{in at least}} two other groups. The Albany pitcher plant Cephalotus follicularis is a small pitcher plant from Western Australia, with moccasin-like pitchers. The rim of its pitcher's opening (the peristome) is particularly pronounced (both secrete nectar) and provides a thorny overhang to the opening, preventing trapped insects from climbing out. In at least one species, Sarracenia flava, the nectar bribe is laced with coniine, a toxic alkaloid also found in hemlock, which probably increases the efficiency of the traps by intoxicating prey.|$|E
