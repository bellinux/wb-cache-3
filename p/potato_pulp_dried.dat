Potato {{is one of the most}} important products in the world after rice, wheat and maize. <b>Potato</b> <b>pulp</b> is a by-product which remains after extraction of starch, and can be used as animal feed. Because of the high moisture content of the <b>potato</b> <b>pulp,</b> silage is the best way to maintain it. However, its high moisture content leads to inappropriate ensilage. Adding of moisture absorbents (MA) not only reduce the effluents, but also improve the silage quality. Materials with high content of cell wall are suitable candidates to be used as MA. Agro-industrial co-products including raisin wastes and pomegranate seed pulp have high cell wall and no report was found for their usage as MA.

Currently used chemical or biological methods for the eradication of S. sclerotiorum from a soil are not very effective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of eradication of S. sclerotiorum sclerotia from a soil using the Trichoderma isolates, which were multiplied on the organic carriers prepared from agro-industrial wastes and by-products: WsA (wheat straw + apple pomaces), WsP (wheat straw + <b>potato</b> <b>pulp)</b> and T-GRAN (<b>dry</b> onion rind, apples and strawberry pomaces, rapeseed meal). The results showed that soil amendment with organic materials overgrown with the Trichoderma fungi had a significant reducing effect on S. sclerotiorum. Especially effective was the carrier WsA overgrown with T. virens TRS 114, which completely prevented the survival of sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum regardless of the dose of application. Less effective was the WsP carrier. However, addition WsP overgrown with T. atroviride TRS 40 at the 5 % w/v, resulted in survival only 6. 7 % of sclerotia. In the greenhouse experiments with lettuce, the application of granulates T-GRAN into the soil had different impact on S. sclerotiorum depending on the conditions to the pathogen development.

40|$|Background. <b>Potato</b> <b>pulp</b> {{constitutes}} a complicated system of {{four types of}} polysaccharides: cellulose, hemi-cellulose, pectin and starch.

The aim of this research project was to assess the usefulness of commer-cial enzymatic preparations for the hydrolysis of <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} hydrolysates obtained in this way as raw materials for ethanol fermentation. Material and methods. Sterilised <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> was subjected to hydrolysis with commercial enzymatic preparations. The effectiveness of the preparations declared as active towards only one fraction of <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> (separate amylase, pectinase and cellulase activity) and mixtures of these preparations was analysed.

The application of amylolytic enzymes for <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> hydrolysis resulted in the release of only 18 % of raw material with glucose as the dominant (77 %) constituent of the formed product.

40|$|Due to {{the health}} effects of dietary fibre, as well as its water-holding {{capacity}} (WHC), food products are commonly fortified with fibre-rich sources. However, to be able to design food products with specific textural properties that also appeal to the consumer, {{it is important to understand}} and to characterise the physicochemical and chemical properties of the fibre. In this study the composition of dietary fibre, the solubility of pectin, the microstructure, rheological properties and water-holding capacity, as well as the sensory properties of fruit and vegetable suspensions and fibre-amended sausages, have been investigated. The plant materials used were tomato, apple, carrot and <b>potato</b> <b>pulp.</b> The variation in these properties following different kinds of processing, i. e. homogenisation and heat treatment, was also studied. The fibre suspensions responded differently to high-pressure homogenisation. This could be due to the fundamentally different inherent microstructures of the samples, probably originating from different proportions of soluble and insoluble fibre. A high content of insoluble pectin and a high perceived crispiness/graininess was found in suspensions with a microstructure consisting of large cell clusters and aggregates (carrot and <b>potato</b> <b>pulp).</b> The micro¬structure of these suspensions is degraded to smaller clusters by homo¬genisation, but retains their original cellular shape. However, suspensions with a microstructure consisting of single cells and cell fragments (tomato and apple), were more easily degraded by homogenisation, and contained lower amounts of insoluble pectin. The latter type of microstructure exhibited a higher WHC, elastic modulus and sensory perceived melting and slipperiness. The main effect of heat treatment was on the solubility of the dietary fibre. In carrot and apple suspensions where β-elimination was favoured by heating, an increase was seen in the amount of soluble pectin together with a decrease in the mean particle size of the insoluble fibre. With the decrease in the insoluble material, a significant decrease in the WHC was seen for both apple and carrot. Heat-treated <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> suspensions were affected differently, since starch remaining in the matrix started to swell, which led to a difference in the particle size distribution and morphology. There was also a significant increase in WHC with heating, probably resulting from the swelling of the starch. Low-fat sausages containing <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> exhibited greater firmness than the sausage without any fibre, according to a compression test. It is suggested that the high content of insoluble fibre in the <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> forms a strong fibrous network in the meat protein network of the sausages, thereby increasing the firmness...|$|R
