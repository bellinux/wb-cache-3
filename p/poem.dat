5|$|Another {{story of}} the poem's origin claimed that Helmer's funeral was held {{on the morning of}} May 2, after which McCrae wrote the <b>poem</b> in 20 minutes.

Regardless of its true origin, McCrae worked on the <b>poem</b> for months before considering it ready for publication. He submitted it to The Spectator in London but it was rejected.

5|$|As Eliot was {{finishing}} his second <b>poem,</b> World War II began to disrupt {{his life and}} he spent more time lecturing across Great Britain and helping out during the war when he could. It was during this time that Eliot began working on The Dry Salvages, the third <b>poem,</b> which was put together {{near the end of}} 1940. This <b>poem</b> was published in February 1941 and Eliot immediately began to plot out his fourth <b>poem,</b> Little Gidding. Eliot's health declined and he stayed in Shamley Green to recuperate. His illness and the war disrupted his ability to write and he became dissatisfied with each draft. He believed that the problem with the <b>poem</b> was with himself and that he had started the <b>poem</b> too soon and written it too quickly. By September 1941, he stopped writing and focused on his lecturing. It was not until September 1942 that Eliot finished the last <b>poem</b> and it was finally published.|$|E

As Coleridge worked on the <b>poem,</b> he and Fricker were married and they moved to the Clevedon home. During this time, Coleridge held an idealised view of his life with Fricker, and these thoughts work their way into the <b>poem.</b> The <b>poem</b> was published in the 1796 edition of Coleridge's poems and in all subsequent collections. Of his poems for the 1796 collection, Coleridge felt that The Eolian Harp was his favourite.|$|E

5|$|Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard is a <b>poem</b> by Thomas Gray, {{completed}} in 1750 and {{first published in}} 1751. The poem’s origins are unknown, but it was partly inspired by Gray’s thoughts {{following the death of}} the poet Richard West in 1742. Originally titled Stanzas Wrote in a Country Church-Yard, the <b>poem</b> was completed when Gray was living near St Giles' parish church at Stoke Poges. It was sent to his friend Horace Walpole, who popularised the <b>poem</b> among London literary circles. Gray was eventually forced to publish the work on 15 February 1751, to pre-empt a magazine publisher from printing an unlicensed copy of the <b>poem.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{began working}} on The Dry Salvages during World War II {{at a time when}} London was {{experiencing}} air-raids near the end of 1940. During the time, he moved around often and spent his time writing mostly lectures or tiny poems. However, he was able to find time to work on the third <b>poem</b> that would become part of the Four Quartets: Eliot envisioned that Burnt Norton, East Coker, The Dry Salvages, and a fourth, yet uncreated <b>poem</b> would be united in a set. Eliot wrote the <b>poem</b> quickly and sent the first draft off on 1 January 1941 to John Hayward. After Hayward received the draft, the two began corresponding about corrections and alterations to the <b>poem.</b> Geoffrey Faber joined in and then the <b>poem</b> was soon finished. It was published in the February 1941 issue of the New English Weekly.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the third Four Quartets <b>poem,</b> The Dry Salvages, Eliot's health declined and he stayed in Shamley Green, Surrey while he recovered. During this time, Eliot started writing Little Gidding. The first draft was completed in July 1941 but he was dissatisfied with it. He believed the problems with the <b>poem</b> lay with his own inability to write, and that, precipitated by air raids on London, he had started the <b>poem</b> with too little preparation and had written it too quickly. After the first draft was written, he set the <b>poem</b> aside, and he left in September to lecture throughout Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|From 1350 to 1400—the {{period in}} which the <b>poem</b> is thought to have been written—Wales {{experienced}} several raids {{at the hands of the}} English, who were attempting to colonise the area. The Gawain poet uses a North West Midlands dialect common on the Welsh–English border, potentially placing him in the midst of this conflict. Patricia Clare Ingham is credited with first viewing the <b>poem</b> through the lens of postcolonialism, and since then a great deal of dispute has emerged over the extent to which colonial differences play a role in the <b>poem.</b> Most critics agree that gender plays a role, but differ about whether gender supports the colonial ideals or replaces them as English and Welsh cultures interact in the <b>poem.</b>|$|E

5|$|In July 1793, Southey {{discussed}} {{the story of}} Joan of Arc with Grosvenor Bedford, his friend. The conversation led to him believe that Joan of Arc {{would serve as a}} good basis for an epic so he began to work a plan for the <b>poem</b> and started composing lines. The subject of the <b>poem</b> appealed to Southey because it reflected incidents surrounding the French Revolution that started in early 1793. By 8 August, he had around 300lines of the <b>poem</b> written. On 13 August, he devoted his time to writing a 12-book <b>poem</b> that he hoped to complete by the end of September. After admitting this desire for haste in the preface to the poem's first edition, critics accused Southey of not spending enough time on composing the <b>poem.</b> During Summer 1794, Southey attempted to find a publisher for John of Arc while taking up The Fall of Robespierre, a poetic drama about the French Revolution, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge.|$|E

5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's {{philosophy of the}} sensations, which argued that the senses were the origin of ideas. Information described {{in the beginning of}} the <b>poem</b> is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of the <b>poem</b> is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the <b>poem</b> deals with the senses and the ending describes how we are limited in our ability to understand the world. The <b>poem</b> takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the <b>poem</b> knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E
