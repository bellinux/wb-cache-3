The liquefied wood having a high wood to <b>polyhydric</b> <b>alcohol</b> ratio (W/P ratio) could be prepared by using the wood treated with ozone in the liquid phase. The liquefied wood with a W/P ratio of 2 [*]:[*] 1 had enough fluidity {{to act as a}} raw material for chemical products. To get some information about the effects of ozone treatment toward the wood components, cellulose powder and steamed lignin were treated with ozone and liquefied. In particular, ozone treatment in the liquid phase was found to be effective for wood and cellulose powder. On the other hand, steamed lignin self-condensed during liquefaction after treatment with ozone in the liquid phase. Thus, ozone treatment provided lignin with reactive functional groups, and caused the subsequent condensation reaction. Although lignin was converted to a more condensable structure by ozone treatment, the condensation reaction was found to be suppressed for wood during its liquefaction. The wood liquefied products displayed good solubilities in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) even after treatments of long duration. It was suggested that one of the main effects of ozone treatment toward wood was the decomposition of cellulose.|$|E
