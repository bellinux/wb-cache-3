50|$|The basal Hettangian-Sinemurian {{sequence}} is fully transgressive over basement rocks or Permo-Triassic sediments. At that time, the first open-marine sediments (yet rather poor in fossils) were being {{deposited in the}} Aquitaine Basin. The Lias Transgression, as it is also called, started to encroach on the entire Aquitaine during the Sinemurian, characterised by calcareous-dolomitic, partially oolitic sediments. Despite smaller regressions during the Pliensbachian {{towards the end of}} the Lias and at the beginning of the Dogger the sea had onlapped the basement rocks of the Massif Central and the western Vendée (reaching today's limits) by 30 km. On the Aquitaine Plateau in the north, an interior shelf was constructed as far south as the line La Rochelle-Angoulême-Périgueux-Figeac. On this shelf the generally detritic transgression sediments of the Hettangian normally comprise a base conglomerate, arkoses, and fairly thick layers of sand- and mud-stones rich in plant material. The rest of the Hettangian is made up of marine sediments deposited in a restricted environment (lagoonal) evolving towards a lacustrine facies (green shales, coloured marls, dolomitic limestones and platy limestones rich in dwarf fossils, and evaporitic interlayers). The sediments of the Sinemurian are again fully marine and carry a <b>pelagic</b> <b>fauna</b> (soft banded limestones and hard lithographic limestones). At the end of the Sinemurian, a sudden regression occurred, forming hardgrounds.|$|E
50|$|The up to 500 m {{thick layer}} of Lower Triassic (Buntsandstein) {{comprises}} conglomerates, breccia, brown sandstones, argillites, shales, and siltstones. The Middle Triassic (Muschelkalk) can attain a thickness of 400 m and shows silty shales, evaporite deposits, and dolomitic micrites. The up to 500 m thick Upper Triassic Keuper deposits {{are made up of}} carbonate-rich sediments, salt, siltstones, and intercalated ophitic diabases/olivine dolerites. The lower Lias is a transgressive sequence with up to 200 m of non-marine sandstone, near-shore marine limestone and evaporites. A <b>pelagic</b> <b>fauna</b> at the top suggests open marine conditions. The middle and upper Lias consist of 230 m of shallow marine platform sediments (bioclastic limestone, argillaceous limestone, and micritic limestone). During the Middle Jurassic, an oolitic barrier, made up mostly of argillaceous micrites, separates an outer shelf from an inner shelf. The Upper Jurassic (Malm) deposits are mainly shales and carbonates. Near the end of the Jurassic, restricted environments were established with dolomicrites, banded limestones, and evaporites. The Lower Cretaceous layer starts with sandstones, shales, limestones, and calcareous breccia in the Neocomian, followed by Barremian marls and limestones. During the lower Aptian, sandstones, shales, sandy marls, and limestones were laid down. The upper Aptian and the Albian are mainly marls and limestones. The Upper Cretaceous includes a littoral Turonian with sandstones and sandy limestones. By the beginning of the Senonian (Campanian), a deep trough had formed (the Subpyrenean Basin) receiving a very thick flysch sequence. The Campanian and Maastrichtian flyschs comprise 2000 to 3000 m of periodically interlayered fines (marls, calcareous shales, and mudstones) and coarser sediments (conglomerates, sandstones, and greywackes). Near the K/T boundary, the Subpyrenean Basin was filled with continental red deposits in Garumnian facies even including dinosaur eggs in a few places. At this point, the Subpyrenean Basin underwent folding accompanied by a weak metamorphism.|$|E

40|$|The {{redefinition}} {{of the lower}} boundary of a traditional stage {{by means of a}} GSSP must be adapted as closely as practicable to the traditional boundary level because divergence between the original sense of the stage concept and name and the new GSSP creates confusing nomenclature. The present GSSP for the lower boundary of the Emsian Stage in the Zinzilban section (Kitab Reserve, SE Uzbekistan) is too low in the section to fulfill this requirement. Accordingly, a {{redefinition of}} the boundary of the lower Emsian by the International Subcommission on Devonian Stratigraphy (SDS) and the IUGS Commission on Stratigraphy is necessary. A new GSSP must be defined at a higher level and this could be done in strata of the present stratotype area. The stratigraphic correlation of the traditional Lower Emsian boundary and the GSSP is based on Mauro-Ibero-Armorican and Rheno-Ardennan benthic and <b>pelagic</b> <b>faunas...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{relatively}} rich assemblages of {{shark teeth}} from pelagic limestone (Mississippian, late Viséan, late Asbian–middle Brigantian) of three northern European regions: the Rhenish Mountains (Westenfeld Quarry, Germany), the Holy Cross Mountains (Todowa Grz ą ba {{at the edge}} of Ostrówka Quarry, Poland), and Derbyshire (Cawdor Quarry, Matlock, England, UK) display certain similarities, with the absolute predominance of the teeth of Falcatidae (small Symmoriiformes) and the constant presence of Thrinacodus spp. The largest and most diverse assemblage from Todowa Grz ą ba contains at least three species of a falcatid Denaea, a xenacanthimorph Bransonella nebraskensis, a newly described phoebodontid Thrinacodus dziki sp. nov., a few ctenacanthiform and euselachian teeth, and two abraded euchondrocephalan dental elements. Anachronistidae, common in the most of late Viséan <b>pelagic</b> <b>faunas,</b> are absent from Todowa Grz ą ba and Westenfeld.

40|$|We present new {{and more}} {{complete}} information than previously available on the <b>pelagic</b> <b>fauna</b> of the Lena River Delta, eastern Siberia. Zooplankton samples collected between 2000 and 2011 from 11 varied aquatic habitats on Samoylov Island have been examined and clear differences noted between the zooplankton communities in different types of tundra waterbody. Well-marked synchronism {{in the development of}} common species populations was, however, revealed by analysis of their life cycles. The <b>pelagic</b> <b>fauna</b> of the investigated aquatic ecosystems is heterogeneous in origin, consisting mainly of aboriginal Arctic species but also including invasive species from more temperate latitudes and relicts of ice-age fauna. One hundred and twenty-five zooplankton taxa belonging to Rotifera (67) and Arthropoda (58) phyla were identified. Five Copepoda species and seven Cladocera species were recorded {{for the first time in}} the Lena River Delta; the presence of most of these species in the delta’s aquatic ecosystems is associated with Lena River water influx during spring flood. Two calanoid copepods, Eurytemora arctica Wilson and Tash and Eurytemora foveola Johnson, are new species to Palearctic <b>pelagic</b> <b>fauna,</b> previously known only from the Nearctic.

40|$|Sequestration, in {{contrast}} to export, is a mechanism of the biological pump occurring when carbon cannot return to the atmosphere in at least 100 years, normally the carbon transported below 1000 m depth. <b>Pelagic</b> <b>fauna</b> release carbon at depth through respiration, egestion, excretion, moulting, lipid consumption and mortality supporting deep-sea food webs. Knowledge about this transport in the mesopelagic layer is growing. However, {{the role of the}} <b>pelagic</b> <b>fauna</b> to fuel the bathypelagic zone, the layer where effective carbon sequestration occurs, is largely unknown. Here we report net zooplankton biomass in the meso- and bathypelagic zones showing significant relationships with primary production (PP) at a global scale during the Malaspina Circumnavigation Expedition. We also reviewed available data on zooplankton biomass at the different biogeographical provinces also showing significant correlations with large-scale estimates of PP, implying the transference of a significant fraction of PP from the epipelagic to the deep ocean. Carbon sequestration assessed only from conservative estimates of zooplankton mortality in the bathypelagic was 0. 43 PgC y- 1, in the order of recent estimates of gravitational carbon sequestration. These values and those recently reviewed due to lipid consumption almost triples ocean carbon sequestration estimates in Westerlies and Polar biomes. These results point at a pivotal role of the <b>pelagic</b> <b>fauna</b> in ocean carbon sequestration as, besides zooplankton, downward transport by macroplankton and micronekton should also be accounted for. Our results {{raises the question of whether}} we are severely underestimating carbon sequestration in the ocea...|$|E
30|$|The first {{sequence}} {{corresponds to}} the Aptian–Lower Albian interval and consists of two sedimentary members. The first member begins by two black shales indicating Barremian–Aptian transition which are related to OAE 1 a and are overlain by Upper Aptian olive-green clays and basal Lower Albian grey marlstones. The latter are enriched with <b>pelagic</b> <b>fauna</b> containing, especially pyritic ammonites. The second member is represented by thick black shales corresponding to OAE 1 b interbedded with nodular limestone becoming thicker and bioturbated at the top (Fig.  6).|$|E
50|$|Classic, low-density turbidites are {{characterized}} by graded bedding, current ripple marks, climbing ripple laminations, alternating sequences with <b>pelagic</b> sediments, distinct <b>fauna</b> changes between the turbidite and native pelagic sediments, sole markings, thick sediment sequences, regular bedding, and an absence of shallow-water features (Fairbridge, 1966). A different vertical progression of sedimentary structures characterize high-density turbidites.|$|R
40|$|The first {{appearance}} of the brachiopod Cyrtospirifer and related forms in the Late Devonian of South China significantly postdates {{the beginning of the}} Frasnian and the entry of the group {{in other parts of the}} world. Scattered data from different sections suggest that its first entry, associated with the emergence of other plicate spiriferids, such as theodossid and conispiriferid brachiopods, was late in the Middle Frasnian. At the same time, many rhynchonellids disappeared or be− came extinct locally in South China. This brachiopod faunal overturn near the Palmatolepis punctata–Early Pa. hassi zonal boundary is the most significant event in the Early–Middle Frasnian of South China, characterized by about a 35 % loss of existing species and the flourishing of the plicate spiriferids, which was coeval with the end of a major biogeochemical perturbation recently recognized in the Pa. punctata Zone. By contrast, atrypid brachiopods do not seem to show any significant diversity change. The brachiopod faunal change was probably related to a (local?) transgressive event in South China, which also brought new <b>pelagic</b> <b>faunas</b> northwards into some intra−shelf deeper water areas, such as the Shetianqiao area in central Hunan Province. Fifteen brachiopod species are described and illustrated, which include some taxa that are first recorded or recognized in South China, e. g., the spiriferid Pyramidaspirifer, which is now known from both North America and South China. One new species, Desquamatia qiziqiaoensis, is erected...|$|R
40|$|In the Huizache-Caimanero lagoon {{system on}} the Pacific coast of Mexico, data {{concerning}} lagoon hydrography was obtained and qualitative studies were made of the lagoon vegetation, bird <b>fauna,</b> <b>pelagic</b> and benthic <b>fauna.</b> Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei Boone and Penaeus (Litopenaeus stylirostlis Stimpson were the dominant penaeids and, numerically, Lile stolifera (Jordan and Gilbert), Anchoa panamensis (Steindachner) and Mugil curema (Civier and Valenciennes) were the dominant fish species within the lagoon. Two species of portunid crab, Callinectes arcuatus Ordway and Callinectes toxotes Ordway, occurred in the lagoon with the former by far the more abundant. Population densities were generally higher in the "esteros" (estuaries) and canals than in the open lagoons. Postlarval penaeid immigration was maximum in the wet season. Subsequent growth was rapid and estimates of growth rate of up to 0. 4 mm carapace length/day were obtained for P. vannamei. The natural diets of penaeid shrimps and portunid crabs, and the feeding modes of some important fish and bird species are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (DWHOS) necessitated a whole-water-column {{approach}} for assessment {{that included the}} epipelagic (0 - 200 m), mesopelagic (200 - 1000 m) and bathypelagic (3 ̆e 1000 m) biomes. The latter two biomes collectively form the largest integrated habitat in the GoM. This habitat received the initial oil/methane discharge, plus millions of liters of dispersant, and contained persistent deep (1100 m) plumes of oil and dispersant. By some estimates, {{only half of the}} discharged oil and none of the methane reached the ocean surface, demonstrating that DWHOS had an extensive deep-pelagic component. Before the DWHOS we had only a basic knowledge of the deep-pelagic GoM. Data regarding biodiversity, abundance, and distribution of the <b>pelagic</b> <b>fauna</b> were not comprehensive and thus, a large-scale program, the NOAA Offshore Nekton Sampling and Analysis Program (ONSAP), was implemented as part of the NRDA process. Here we provide the initial results of a 3 -month ONSAP field campaign in 2011 in which the <b>pelagic</b> <b>fauna</b> was sampled from 0 - 1500 m. During this campaign, from the 87, 402 specimens collected, a minimum total of 459 fish species were represented. Ongoing analyses will certainly increase this number, as hard-to-identify taxa are resolved. This figure represents nearly one-third of the fish species currently known for the GoM. Of these species, 53 are previously unknown in the GoM, including previously undescribed species...|$|E
30|$|The {{base of the}} Aptian is {{represented}} by olive-green ammonite-rich silty clays marked locally by glauconite with frequent yellow siliciclastic thin beds. At this time, the structural architecture of the basin was marked by tilted blocks on the normal E-W faults side. A thick sedimentary sequence with <b>pelagic</b> <b>fauna</b> filled the collapsed areas, whereas the condensed series of reduced thickness are typical of outer-shelf and peritidal setting on resistant blocks. Barremian–Aptian black shales are settled beside the top of resistant block in Oued Bou Hejba (OOB section) near Jebel Oust.

40|$|Much {{has been}} written over the last 20 yr on the Upper Kellwasser Event (Frasnian/Famennian or F/F boundary) as the major {{extinction}} event of the Middle Palaeozoic (Devonian) and as the fifth largest extinction event in the Phanerozoic; this opinion was based on analysis of family range data. These views are misleading. A current analysis of family extinction data, largely based on The Fossil Record 2, but updated in some respects, supersedes the data base of Raup and Sepkoski (1982) and shows that the Famennian has the highest total family extinction of marine taxa, with the Givetian in second and Frasnian in third place. If these new data are related to current (unreliable) estimated length of stages, then the severest extinction rates are: first, the Givetian at 14. 2 family extinctions per Ma, secondly the Frasnian at 11. 2 and thirdly the Eifelian at 6. 8. Many short-term 'events' have been named for the Devonian based on short-term distinctive sedimentary and/or faunal perturbations. A review of these shows how they are often transgression/regression couplets, many with an association of anoxia and poor in benthos, or spreads of <b>pelagic</b> <b>faunas,</b> and some are phased and complex. Evidence is presented {{to suggest that the}} transgressive pulses correspond to warm temperatures which are terminated by cooling. Possible links with orbitally forced patterns are considered. A common explanation seems required, not just for the Kellwasser Event, but for all these events. The relation of the family stage extinctions, especially the Kacak, Taghanic, Kellwasser and Hangenberg Events, which are of much more limited duration, is discussed particularly in relation to new and more precise data of the extinction events known within these stages. In the absence of detailed studies for many groups, those that have been well documented may serve as a temporary proxy for other...|$|R
40|$|Large {{numbers of}} waders {{migrating}} northward in spring use the Sivash, a large system of shallow, brackish and hypersaline lagoons in the Black Sea and Azov Sea region (Ukraine). The bottoms of these lagoons are often uncovered by the wind. Hence, for waders {{the time and}} space available for feeding depend on wind conditions. In hypersaline lagoons the benthic and <b>pelagic</b> <b>fauna</b> was very poor, consisting mainly of chironomid larvae (0. 19 g AFDM. m- 2) and brine shrimps Artemia salina, respectively. Brine shrimp abundance was correlated with salinity, wind force, wind direction and water depth. Dunlin Calidris alpina and curlew sandpiper Calidris ferruginea were the only species feeding on brine shrimp. As brine shrimp densities are higher in deeper water, smaller waders such as broad-billed sandpipers Limicola falcinellus are too short-legged to reach exploitable densities of brine shrimp. In brackish lagoons the benthic and <b>pelagic</b> <b>fauna</b> was rich, consisting of polychaetes, bivalves, gastropods, chironomid larvae, isopods and amphipods (8. 9 to 30. 5 g AFDM. m- 2), {{but there were no}} brine shrimps. Prey biomass increased with the distance from the coast, being highest on the site that was most frequently inundated. Dunlin, broad-billed sandpiper and grey plover Pluvialis squatarola were the most abundant birds in the brackish lagoon. Due to the effects of wind-tides only a small area was usually available as a feeding site. Gammarus insensibilis was the alternative prey resource in the water layer, and their density varied with wind direction {{in the same way as}} brine shrimp. Curlew sandpipers and dunlins in the hypersaline lagoons and broad-billed sandpipers in the brackish lagoons often changed feeding sites, probably following the variation in prey availability. Only because of the large size and variety of lagoons are waders in the Sivash always able to find good feeding sites...|$|E

Some large samples with C. pyramidata from the northern Red Sea made it possible to establish the correct identity of these populations. Though special variation, like described for Diacria and Cavolinia species (Van der Spoel, l. c.), is found for Red Sea populations of C. pyramidata, the populations are not separated as an endemic taxon as the specimens resemble closely Clio pyramidata forma convexa (Boas, 1886) (figs. 1 - 4).

Differences were attributed to higher nutrient input from marine organisms, such as penguins seals and petrels and probably also to a somewhat longer ice-free period Since the lakes of South Georgia lack fish, the <b>pelagic</b> invertebrate <b>fauna</b> is dominated by herbivorous macrozooplankton Rotifers are rare in the open water and are restricted to the vegetation (mainly mosses) in shallow areas and to the sediment surface Generally, the algal abundance at the sediment surface is high in subantarctic lakes, indicating that {{the main part of the}} primary production is provided by benthic algae, which is in contrast to what is normally the case in temperate water...|$|R
40|$|Gill nets set {{at three}} depths at an open-water station in Lake Titicaca during August 1984 {{captured}} only {{two species of}} endemic killifishes (Orestias ispi and o. mulleri) and an exotic silverside (Basilichthyes bonariensis). These species segregated strongly by depth, with B. bonariensis and o. mulleri occurring only in the surface and bottom sets, respectively, and O. ispi being most abundant in the mid-water set. All three species were feeding on zooplankton, but o. mulleri also included benthic crustaceans in its diet. Copepods were strongly selected by large (3 ̆e 200 mm SL) B. bonariensis, whereas smaller size classes ate mainly cladocerans. Copepods and cladocerans were about equally represented in the average diet of adult O. ispi, but larvae contained only copepods. Analysis of egg size-frequency distributions of gill-netted and seine-netted samples suggested that both Orestias species are fractional spawners. Horizontal trawls, made at depths between 10 m and the bottom, collected mainly Orestias larvae.

40|$|Abundance {{patterns}} of planktic and benthic foraminifera from a tropical Atlantic drill site (Ocean Drilling Program Site 1259, Demerara Rise, Suriname margin) display a pronounced 400 kyr cyclicity, uninterrupted throughout our ~ 87. 8 - 92 Ma record, between two clearly distinguishable assemblages: (1) a <b>pelagic</b> foraminifer <b>fauna,</b> which represents a deep oxygen minimum zone, and (2) another assemblage representing a shallow oxygen minimum zone where the foraminifer fauna {{is dominated by}} a higher diversity population of mostly small clavate and biserial species common in epicontinental seas. The cyclic changes in the long eccentricity band (400 kyr) between these two assemblages are proposed to reflect changes in the mean latitudinal position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Associated fluctuations in precipitation and trade wind strength may have influenced the upwelling regime at Demerara Rise leading to the observed cyclicity of planktic foraminiferal assemblages. The severe Turonian to Coniacian paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic changes in the Atlantic Ocean (e. g., gateway opening, cooling, and glaciation), however, seem to have no influence on the composition of tropical planktic foraminiferal faunas. There is no apparent relationship between foraminifer abundances and a major deflection in the stable isotope record interpreted elsewhere {{as a sign of}} the growth and decay of a large polar ice sheet...|$|R

According to the ancient Italian paleogeographic position and paleoenvironmental context (shallow water), tropical forms are the most common among fishes, but also pelagic associations are found, mainly in the Upper Cretaceous. Brackish-water ichthyofaunas are also possibly present. Chondrichthyes are usual components of teh <b>pelagic</b> fish <b>fauna.</b> Alepisauriforms, elopiforms and clupeomorphs are often the most common and differentiated among the osteichthyans; Picnodonts are frequent in shallow carbonate platform environments.

Indications are that most species encountered off Ghana may be widely distributed in the Gulf of Guinea, most notably the long-beaked common dolphin. The vulnerable Atlantic humpback dolphin, Sousa teuszii, remains unrecorded in Ghana and neighbouring nations despite apparently suitable coastal habitat. It is suggested that localized extinction may be blamed, possibly the result of accumulative bycatches and disturbance. A number of other cetacean species not yet encountered could occasionally occur in Ghana’s waters, e. g. Balaenoptera brydei, Mesoplodon densirostris, Kogia breviceps, Stenella coeruleoalba and Delphinus delphis </div...|$|R
40|$|A classic {{paradigm}} of oceanic ecology is that pelagic animal biomass decreases exponentially with depth. Results of a muti-year {{study of the}} distribution and ecology of the <b>pelagic</b> <b>fauna</b> over the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), from Iceland to the Azores, revealed that water column biomass maxima can occur at deep meso- and bathypelagic depths (3 ̆e 750 m). Further, topographic association of the deep-pelagic fauna occurs at some locations. For example, bathypelagic fish abundance and biomass maxima were observed within the benthic boundary layer (3 ̆c 200 m above the bottom) during the 2004 G. O. Sars MAR-ECO expedition. Results of a pelagic food-web model over the MAR suggest that alternate trophic pathways contribute significantly to this deep biomass maxima. Consumption of decapod crustacea and gelatinous zooplankton represented major portions of the total consumption by pelagic fishes. Stable isotope analysis of 63 species, from zooplankton to large benthic predators, suggest short food chains and high trophic efficiency may account for enhanced deep-pelagic biomass...|$|E
40|$|EN] The {{submarine}} volcano eruption off El Hierro Island (Canary Islands) on 10 October 2011 promoted dramatic perturbation of {{the water}} column leading {{to changes in the}} distribution of <b>pelagic</b> <b>fauna.</b> To study the response of the scattering biota, we combined acoustic data with hydrographic profiles and concurrent sea surface turbidity indexes from satellite imagery. We also monitored changes in the plankton and nekton communities through the eruptive and post-eruptive phases. Decrease of oxygen, acidification, rising temperature and deposition of chemicals in shallow waters resulted in a reduction of epipelagic stocks and a disruption of diel vertical migration (nocturnal ascent) of mesopelagic organisms. Furthermore, decreased light levels at depth caused by extinction in the volcanic plume resulted in a significant shallowing of the deep acoustic scattering layer. Once the eruption ceased, the distribution and abundances of the pelagic biota returned to baseline levels. There was no evidence of a volcano-induced bloom in the plankton community. </p...|$|E
40|$|In a {{changing}} ocean {{there is a}} critical need to understand global biogeochemical cycling, particularly regarding carbon. We have made strides in understanding upper ocean dynamics, but the deep ocean interior (>  1000  m) is still largely unknown, despite representing {{the overwhelming majority of}} Earth's biosphere. Here we present a method for estimating deep-pelagic zooplankton biomass on an ocean-basin scale. We have made several new discoveries about the Atlantic, which likely apply to the world ocean. First, multivariate analysis showed that depth and Chl were the basic factors affecting the wet biomass of the main plankton groups. Wet biomass of all major groups was significantly correlated with Chl. Second, zooplankton biomass in the upper bathypelagic domain is higher than expected. Third, the majority of this biomass comprises macroplanktonic shrimps, which have been historically underestimated. These findings, coupled with recent findings of increased global deep-pelagic fish biomass, suggest that the contribution of the deep-ocean <b>pelagic</b> <b>fauna</b> for biogeochemical cycles may be more important than previously thought...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy {{of the sites}} drilled during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 124 in the Celebes and Sulu Seas. It discusses preservation of foraminifers in pelagic sediments and in calcareous turbidites. In the Celebes Sea, pelagic carbonates are only found in the Eocene and Oligocene at Site 770. The faunas are poorly preserved due to severe dissolution and offer little biostratigraphic detail. In the Sulu Sea, pelagic carbonates {{are found in the}} upper Pliocene and Pleistocene at Sites 768 and 769 and throughout the recovered sequence at the shallower Site 771. The foraminifer faunas from these sediments allow for recognition of most standard zones. Variations in preservation of <b>pelagic</b> foraminifer <b>faunas</b> with time are due to changes in the depth of the lysocline. Shifts to improved preservation at Sites 768 and 769 are synchronous in the upper Pliocene/Pleistocene and may be related to global sea-level cycles. Planktonic foraminifers are also abundant in calcareous turbidites, which were deposited in both basins from the late Miocene onward. However, the turbidites are fine-grained, and biostratigraphic marker species are absent as a result of size-sorting during transport. In the Celebes Sea, shelf-derived material was a major component of early-late Miocene and middle Pliocene to early Pleistocene turbidites. Changes in the composition of the turbidites may correspond to global sea-level changes. In the Sulu Sea, a shift from shelf-derived material in Pliocene calcareous turbidites to a pelagic source in the Pleistocene may be related to subsidence of the Cagayan Ridge...|$|R
40|$|Zooplankton (Copepoda, Cladocera, Ostracoda, Rotifera and Diptera larvae) in nine North African lakes was {{collected}} from open water areas over twenty months during 1997 / 99. The results {{were used to}} monitor changes in the <b>pelagic</b> micro-invertebrate <b>fauna</b> of these sites {{with the purpose of}} exploring diversity structure and regional species occurrences. The studied sites formed three distinct groups based on hydrology and water quality criteria: (i) acid water with no marine connection (Megene Chitane); (ii) alkaline freshwater/brackish with no marine connection (Merja Sidi Bou Rhaba and Merja Bokka); (iii) freshwater/brackish with marine connection (Merja Zerga, Lac de Korba, Garaet El Ichkeul and three Nile Delta lakes). However, cluster analysis of the zooplankton data alone indicated four groups with Korba being separated because of its prevalence of species tolerant of summer hypersalinity. The total regional zooplanktonic species richness found was 88 taxa and these were characterized by species tolerant of widely fluctuating environmental conditions. However, some recorded species were very rare for North African freshwaters (e. g. Alonella excisa, Leydigia quadrangularis and, Ilyocryptus sordidus) and generally indicate favourable environmental conditions of low salinity and temperature. The sites influenced by marine waters generally exhibited slightly lower numbers of species but which generally demonstrate cosmopolitan distributions. Distinct seasonal patterns in species distributions were more similar to those observed in European lakes rather than to those of lower latitudes sites. Zooplankton {{play a key role in}} maintaining aquatic ecosystem quality in the North African study lakes and the community distributions described for the late 20 th century help set biodiversity base-line data for future studies. If the remaining wetland lakes in this region are to persist as important resources during the 21 st century, they will need to be managed in a way that ensures that aquatic diversity is maintained...|$|R
40|$|The Czorsztyn Succession is the shallowest Pienidic {{unit of the}} West Carpathian Pieniny Klippen Belt. After the Valanginian, a hiatus {{encompassing}} {{almost the}} whole Hauterivian, Barremian and Aptian occurred in this unit. The Tithonian-Lower Cretaceous limestones are overlain by pelagic Albian-Cenomanian marlstones, marly limestones and cherts (Chmielowa and Pomiedznik Formations). The nature of this hiatus was so far unclear, either representing a submarine non-deposition and erosion, or subaerial exposure. The paper brings provides a summary of data collected from the literature and new data from 5 re-examined sites and 5 new sites: Dolný Mlyn, Vršatec (3 sites), Horné Sŕnie, Lednica, Jarabina, Kamenica (all Slovakia), Czerwona Skała Klippe (Poland) and Vilki Dil (Ukraine). At two sites, the Albian marlstones and limestones overlie rocks older than Tithonian or Neocomian. In Jarabina, the Barremian-Aptian erosion reached the level of Kimmeridgian red micritic limestones, though clasts of limestones with "filamentous" microfacies indicate that Bathonian-Callovian limestones were also exposed and eroded. At Horné Sŕnie, the Albian deposits overlie Bajocian crinoidal limestones. The Bathonian to Hauterivian sediments are missing, which indicates that {{this part of the}} Czorsztyn sedimentary area experienced the deepest erosion. Unequivocal indicators of subaerial exposure and karstification, e. g. karren landform with vertical drainage grooves, small cavities in the bottom rock filled with younger sediment, bizarre fractures and veinlets filled with calcite, were revealed mainly at Horné Sŕnie and Lednica sites. The emersion was followed by pelagic of pelagic Albian marlstones and limestones. At this time, the palaeokarst surface was bored by bivalves and encrusted by deep-water Fe-Mn to phosphatic stromatolites. This suggests a very rapid relative sea-level rise, causing marine ingression. There were two transgression pulses in the Late Aptian and Albian, separated by a temporary emersion and karstification. The Upper Aptian sediments are still organodetrital with crinoids and other benthic fauna, whereas those of the Albian contain exclusively <b>pelagic</b> planktonic <b>fauna...</b>|$|R
