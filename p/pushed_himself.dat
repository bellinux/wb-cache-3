25|$|Alex Koslov put his {{recently}} won AAA Cruiserweight Championship {{on the line}} in the third PPV match of the night as he wrestled against Extreme Tiger, Crazy Boy and Alan Stone in a Elimination hardcore match. The match saw the frequent use of both tables and ladders throughout the match, mixed in with steel chairs for good measure. Koslov's reign as the first AAA Cruiserweight champion ended after just over two weeks as he was the first man eliminated from the match, pinned by Alan Stone. With Koslov eliminated it was a guarantee {{that there would be a}} new champion by the end of the match. Alan Stone's inexperience in Hardcore matches caused him to be eliminated secondly, leaving Crazy Boy and Extreme Tiger, both of whom had a great deal of experience with hardcore matches. The final section of the match had several slow sections where one wrestler set up a table, a ladder or an elaborate chair set up while the other wrestler had to lay on the mat and pretend to be knocked down. At one point Crazy Boy very obviously <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> into position so that Extreme Tiger could execute a leap off the top rope onto him. In the final moments of the match saw Extreme Tiger leap out of the ring and splash Crazy Boy through a table. After taking a moment to recover Extreme Tiger was able to get back in the ring, only seconds before the referee counted Crazy Boy out. With the count out victory Extreme Tiger was declared the new AAA Cruiserweight champion.|$|E
500|$|The album {{primarily}} featured co-production between Dr. Dre and Mel-Man and {{was generally}} well received by critics. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that Dr. Dre had expanded on the G-funk beats on his previous album, The Chronic, and stated, [...] "He's <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> hard, finding new {{variations in the}} formula by adding ominous strings, soulful vocals, and reggae, resulting in fairly interesting recontextualizations" [...] {{and went on to}} say, [...] "Sonically, this is first-rate, straight-up gangsta." ...|$|E
500|$|Crane <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> {{to write}} feverishly {{during the first}} months at Brede; he told his {{publisher}} that he was [...] "doing more work now than I have at any other period in my life". [...] His health worsened, and by late 1899 he was asking friends about health resorts. [...] The Monster and Other Stories was in production and War Is Kind, his second collection of poems, {{was published in the}} United States in May. [...] None of his books after The Red Badge of Courage had sold well, and he bought a typewriter to spur output. [...] Active Service, a novella based on Crane's correspondence experience, was published in October. [...] The New York Times reviewer questioned [...] "whether the author of 'Active Service' himself really sees anything remarkable in his newspapery hero." ...|$|E

2500|$|Adams' {{retirement}} in May 2002 meant Vieira became club captain. He described the feeling as [...] "daunting", {{but it was}} something he looked forward to: [...] "Taking the responsibility on my shoulders is something I relish. It will make me a better, more mature footballer and a more mature person as well." [...] Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in September 2002, Vieira was sent off for a late tackle on Gianfranco Zola; Arsenal's persistence nevertheless earnt them a point. In an interview with L'Équipe soon after, Vieira spoke of his desire to rest, as he felt [...] "burned out": [...] "I can hardly stand. My back aches, my legs hurt, it hurts all over. I'm going to see Arsène. He must give me time off to relax." [...] He featured in 66 games the previous campaign for Arsenal, but Wenger rejected the player's need for special treatment: [...] "I looked at the statistics for Tuesday's game and, physically, Patrick was outstanding. He <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> very hard and that explains why he was so tired." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michigan captain Paul Goebel won the toss {{and chose}} the south goal. Vanderbilt decided to kick. Kipke made {{a first down}} on the first drive, which started from his own 30-yard line, but Michigan punted the ball away soon after. Vanderbilt kicked back and Michigan punted again after three {{unsuccessful}} pass attempts. The best chance to break the tie came early {{in the first quarter}} when Vanderbilt was forced to punt from its own 7-yard line. [...] The Wolverines completed their first pass, Doug Roby to Goebel, setting in motion the change in field position which led to their being poised to score inside the 5-yard line. The Commodore punt was partially blocked, giving Michigan the ball at Vanderbilt's 25-yard line. Two end runs, two line bucks, and a forward pass brought them there, first and goal. Some six minutes had gone by at this point. The Commodores' defense stiffened and repelled four attempts at a touchdown. Three runs straight up the middle were stopped before the goal line. [...] Cappon made a yard, Kipke lost one, and Cappon then drove to within a foot of the goal. [...] Vanderbilt captain Jess Neely was heard shouting 'Stop em!' On fourth down, Michigan faked a field goal and ran with Harry Kipke off tackle to the right. Kipke was stood up just inches from the end zone. One Vanderbilt player even <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> off of the goal post, in an attempt to generate a greater backwards push, as the crowd cheered.|$|E

2500|$|Neely was {{captain of}} the undefeated 1922 team. In {{the second week of}} play Vanderbilt shut out Henderson-Brown 33–0, with Neely scoring a third-quarter touchdown. Despite an injured left arm, he started in the [...] at the {{dedication}} at Dudley Field. Vanderbilt was forced to punt from its seven-yard line early in the first quarter. [...] The Wolverines completed their first pass (from Doug Roby to Paul Goebel), setting in motion a change in field position which placed them inside the five-yard line. The Commodore punt was partially blocked, giving Michigan the ball at Vanderbilt's 25-yard line. Two end runs, two line bucks and a forward pass brought them to first and goal after six minutes. The Commodore defense stiffened, repelling four touchdown tries; three runs up the middle were stopped before the goal line. Franklin Cappon gained a yard, Harry Kipke lost one and Cappon drove to within a foot of the goal; Neely was heard shouting, [...] "Stop 'em!" [...] On fourth down, Michigan faked a field goal and ran with Harry Kipke off tackle to the right. Kipke was tackled inches from the end zone. A Vanderbilt player <b>pushed</b> <b>himself</b> off the goal post to generate a greater backwards push as the crowd cheered. Vanderbilt's only noteworthy offensive play occurred soon afterwards. The Commodores punted out of the shadow of their goalpost after a goal line stand; Neely tackled Kipke (or Irwin Uteritz) hard on the punt return, causing a fumble which he recovered. He then connected on a 20–plus-yard pass to Tot McCullough. This gave Vanderbilt the ball at Michigan's 20-yard line, but subsequent Vanderbilt plays saw runs stopped with little gain and a pass intercepted by Uteritz. The tie was reportedly preserved when Neely recovered a fumble near the Commodore goal. He and Lynn Bomar were acknowledged as Vanderbilt's players of the game, and Neely wept tears of joy by the game's end. Bomar spent much of his day tackling Michigan runners, and Neely was a battered, bruised captain playing hard despite his injuries. Franklin Cappon said after the game, [...] "What sort of a crazy man is this Neely? He played like a fiend and when he tackled me I thought I was broken in two. When I got up he was crying and cussed me out. I was the one who should have been crying".|$|E
