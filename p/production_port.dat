As of February 2012, the city had a population of 195,800. The city covers an area of 486 km². The city was promoted from Cam Pha District by February, 2012. Cẩm Phả was the site of one of the biggest coal mines in south of Asia which has been exploited for almost a century. The coal mine featured on a special commemorative Vietnam stamp in March 1959.

30|$|Initial {{relative}} permeability Soi and Swir were measured after the core saturation process. The FW was {{injected into the}} carbonate core, which was fully saturated with oil, to reach Swir at a constant flow rate of 4  cm 3 /min. The injection and <b>production</b> <b>port</b> pressures, and amount of produced fluid were recorded. Based on the Hafford method, the displacing fluid was injected at a high flow rate. Due to the high flow rate, the pressure difference of the experimental system was maintained above 20 psi, meaning that the influence of viscous forces exceeded capillarity influences, while restricting the pressure and saturation measurements to the inner sections of the cores, reducing capillary end effects (Honarpour and Mahmood 1988). The injection continued until no further oil was produced, to yield Sor.|$|E
40|$|CO 2 {{flooding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} promising techniques to enhance both light and heavy oil recovery. In light oil recovery, the production pressure in CO 2 flooding in general keeps constant in order to maintain the miscibility of injected CO 2 and crude oil; while in heavy oil recovery, a depleting pressure scheme may be able to induce foamy oil flow, thus the oil recovery could be further enhanced. In this study, different pressure control schemes were tested by 1 -D core-flooding experiments to obtain an optimized one. Numerical simulations were conducted to history match all experimental data to understand the mechanisms and characteristics of different CO 2 flooding strategies. For the core-flooding experiments, 1500 mD sandstone cores, formation brine and a heavy oil sample with a viscosity of about 869. 3 cp at reservoir condition (55  °C and 11  MPa) were used. Before each CO 2 flooding test, early stage water-flooding was conducted until the water cut reached 90 %. Different CO 2 injection rates and production pressure control strategies were tested through core-flooding experiments. Experimental results indicated that a slower CO 2 injection rate (2  ml/min) led to a higher recovery factor from 31. 1 % to 36. 7 %, compared with a high CO 2 injection rate of 7  ml/min; for the effects of different production strategies, a constant production pressure at the <b>production</b> <b>port</b> yielded a recovery factor of 31. 1 %; while a pressure depletion with 47. 2  kPa/min at the <b>production</b> <b>port</b> yielded 7 % more oil recovery; and the best pressure control scheme in which the production pressure keeping constant during CO 2 injection period, then depleting the model pressure with the injector shut-in yielded a recovery factor of 42. 5 % of the initial OOIP. For the numerical simulations study, the same oil relative permeability curve was applied to match the experimental results to all tests. Different gas relative permeability curves were obtained when the production pressure schemes are different. A much lower gas relative permeability curve and a higher critical gas saturation were achieved in the best pressure control scheme case compared to other cases. The lower gas relative permeability curve indicates that foamy oil was formed in the pressure depletion processes. Through this study, it is suggested that the pressure control scheme can be optimized in order to maximize the CO 2 injection performance for enhanced heavy oil recovery...|$|E

In the current study, levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in water and fish samples collected from Suez Gulf were assessed. In addition, gills and liver tissues of caught bass fish were used to address the interaction between pollution status and the expression of stress-related genes (Hsp 70 a, Hsp 70 b, Hsp 47, MT and CYP 1 A). Our analysis demonstrated that levels of PAHs in Floating and Tawfik ports were higher than {{those found in the}} Atakah Fishing Port and the Adabiya Port. In addition, MDA and PC contents were significantly higher in gills and liver tissues collected from Floating and Tawfik ports than those collected from Adabiya and Atakah ports. In correlation to the above results, all fish collected from the Floating and Tawfik ports presented a significant increase in Hsp-, MT- and CYP 1 A—mRNAs. On the other hand, fish samples collected from the Atakah Fishing and Adabiya ports showed no induction of the stress-related genes transcription in such tissues. In conclusion, the current research demonstrates that remarkable increase in PAH contaminants levels in Floating and Tawfik ports are correlated with the levels stress protein-related genes transcription in E. guaga gills and liver tissues...|$|E

50|$|Wine, {{produced}} in the Douro valley, {{was already in the}} 13th century transported to Porto in barcos rabelos (flat sailing vessels).
