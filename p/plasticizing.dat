25|$|The task {{consists}} in feeding 10–25% bottle flakes {{while maintaining the}} quality of the bottle pellets that are manufactured on the line. This aim is solved by degrading the PET bottle flakes—already during their first plasticization, which can be carried out in a single- or multi-screw extruder—to an intrinsic viscosity of about 0.30 dℓ/g by adding small quantities of ethylene glycol and by subjecting the low-viscosity melt stream to an efficient filtration directly after plasticization. Furthermore, temperature is brought to the lowest possible limit. In addition, with this way of processing, the possibility of a chemical decomposition of the hydro peroxides is possible by adding a corresponding P-stabilizer directly when <b>plasticizing.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} the {{influence}} of two different sizes of silica particles (micro-silica and nano-silica) was studied on mechanical properties of sulfur and sulfur composite. To improve the structural properties, sulfur was <b>plasticized</b> using dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and methyl styrene (MSt). <b>Plasticized</b> sulfur composite was prepared by melt blending of <b>plasticized</b> sulfur and silica particles. The increment in compressive and flexural strengths revealed that the micro-particles enhance mechanical properties of sulfur while nano-particles improved mechanical properties of <b>plasticized</b> sulfur. Viscosity measurements indicated that mechanical properties of nano composites containing matrix with low viscosity (sulfur <b>plasticized</b> with methyl styrene) are improved with increasing mixer speed but increasing the mixer speed had negative effect on composites containing matrix with higher viscosity (sulfur <b>plasticized</b> with dicyclopentadiene) ...|$|R

40|$|There exist {{important}} industrial applications, such as hoses {{or plastic}} windows, dealing with closely combining, <b>plasticized</b> and rigid poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). Nevertheless, migration of plasticizer causes severe {{variation of the}} mechanical performance of the end-products. In this work the common system <b>plasticized</b> PVC /di-octyl-phthalate /rigid PVC was studied under two-sided diffusion conditions, i. e. from a thin sheet of <b>plasticized</b> PVC to two sheets of rigid PVC, each in contact with {{one side of the}} <b>plasticized</b> sheet. Three different levels of initial plasticizer concentration (48, 66 and 100 phr) have been considered for a period of about five months, until equilibrium was reached. During this period the migration process was monitored by weight changes. It was proved that the Fick's law approximation for short times can be used to describe the migration kinetics for this solid/solid system. On the other hand, macroscopic observations revealed that no plasticizer was accumulated at the interface, i. e. all plasticizer leaving the <b>plasticized</b> sheet entered the rigid ones.

40|$|The {{high level}} of {{plasticizer}} in <b>plasticized</b> poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) ensures that plasticizer selection has an important influence on the suitability of PVC to function in blood-contacting applications. In this study, three types of <b>plasticized</b> PVC in sheet form, with di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), tri-(2 -ethylhexyl) trimellitate (TEHTM) and n-butyryltri-n-hexyl citrate (BTHC) as plasticizer, were selected for assessment and single solute fibrinogen adsorption was utilized as an initial index of interactions with blood components. Fibrinogen adsorption behavior shows a strong dependence on the plasticizer selection, plasticizer level at the surface and the adsorption conditions, such as adsorption time and fibrinogen solution concentration. Results indicate that BTHC <b>plasticized</b> PVC possesses the lowest adsorption capacity in {{the three types of}} <b>plasticized</b> PVC, while TEHTM <b>plasticized</b> PVC seems to have the strongest reactivity in certain fibrinogen solution concentrations. The alteration of surface plasticizer level was achieved by a methanol-cleaning treatment with a variety of cleaning times and the fibrinogen adsorption on <b>plasticized</b> PVC decreases with the reduction of surface plasticizer level.
