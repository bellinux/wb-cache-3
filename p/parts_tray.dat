40|$|Abstract. With ever {{increased}} demand for reduced sizes and increased complexity and accuracy, traditional machine tools have become ineffective for machining miniature components. Typical examples include dental implants, the parts used in mechanical watch movement, and the parts used in medical endoscope. With complex geometry and tight tolerance, few machine tools are capable of making them. This paper introduces our PC-based CNC Turn-Mill Machining Center. It has 5 axes, an automatic bar feeder, an automatic <b>part</b> collection <b>tray,</b> and a tool changer. In particularly, it has a special synchronization control algorithm that gives not only higher accuracy but also ease of use. In addition, to improve the accuracy, the software based volumetric error compensation system is implemented. Based on the experiment testing, the machining error is ± 3 µm in turning, ± 7 µm in milling and the maximum profile error is less than ± 7. 5 µm in gear hobbing. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis project {{seeks to}} {{optimize}} floor layouts for semiconductor equipment assembly operations. The assembly of semiconductor equipment {{is characterized by}} low volume and high product diversity and complexity. Demand for semiconductor equipment is highly periodic and often shifts rapidly from one type of semiconductor equipment to the other. Thus, {{the goal is to}} develop an assembly system that easily handles high part counts per assembly and facilitates material management, {{but at the same time}} allows reacting to changes in demand quickly and efficiently. Lead time and floor space usage are further metrics that are considered. Capturing the current state of the floor layout in a 3 D drawing software and documenting important aspects of current operations is the first step towards achieving those goals. Current assembly operations consist of the build of subassemblies in dedicated cells and the final assembly of machines in dedicated build lines. That is, each type of product is assembled in a specific area and the required inventory is stored within these areas. In order to increase production flexibility, reduce inventory levels, and to lower floor space usage, a new assembly system is developed. This system features consolidated inventory for both the build of subassemblies and final assembly. It is proposed that technicians pull parts for subassemblies by driving with a cart and attached foam cut-outs as <b>part</b> <b>trays</b> through an inventory aisle. This aisle accommodates inventory for all subassemblies, which is currently stored within approximately 20 cells spread over the production floor. (cont.) Subsequently, technicians drive these carts to generic workbenches and start assembly. Using generic, standardized workbenches rather than dedicated workbenches boosts flexibility and efficiency. Parts for the final assembly would be kitted for each machine by material handlers on movable racks. This allows building any type of machine in any area of the production floor. A block system is proposed to decouple assembly of different machines and to enable easy management of assembly operations. A floor layout based on these ideas is developed. Finally, a pilot proposal is developed to serve as a stepping stone towards full scale implementation and this proposal is in part physically implemented. by Richard Clemens Schwenke. Thesis (M.

Because the exposed part of these foils had to be harvested before extraction of the aerogel, numerous foil strips some 1. 7 mm wide and 13 or 33 mm long were generated during Stardusts's Preliminary Examination (PE). These strips are readily accommodated in their entirety in the sample chambers of modern SEMs, thus providing the opportunity to characterize in situ the size distribution and residue composition - employing EDS methods - of statistically more significant numbers of cometary dust particles compared to aerogel, the latter mandating extensive sample preparation.

The part models contain both exact and fuzzy descriptions of part features, and are stored in an object-oriented database.

Using fuzzy information stored in the model allowed part features that were essentially at the noise level to be extracted and used for identification. This was done by focusing attention on the portion of the part where the feature must be found if the current hypothesis of the part ID is correct. In going from one set of parts to another the only thing that needs to be changed is the database of part models.

40|$|Performance of {{the sheet}} metal cutting and forming tools {{producing}} baking <b>tray</b> <b>parts</b> was monitored. The baking trays are produced from the carbon steel sheet and from the Teflon coated steel sheet, where resistance of the steel substrate of the tool forming inserts against galling is very important, as well as resistance of the cutting inserts to wearing out. The operating inserts were produced from various Uddeholm steels. For the first cutting inserts, Sverker 21 was used, followed by Sleipner steel, both of them uncoated. In order to improve performance, PVD coating (nano-structured TiAlN) was applied on Sleipner substrate. A step forward was using of the powder metallurgy steels, Vanadis 6. The initial forming inserts were made from Vanadis 10 steel, whereas further investigations involved the recently launched steel Vancron 40, a steel type produced specifically for the applications where resistance against galling is a predominant wearing mechanism. The analysis shows that PVD coating provides cost savings due to less frequent tool resharpening. The currently obtained results indicate promising performance of the newly developed steel Vancron 40 for forming applications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn Additive Manufacturing (AM), {{parts are}} {{manufactured}} layer-upon-layer. This strategy affects the mechanical properties of AM parts, since they cannot just {{be assimilated to}} those of parts manufactured by traditional methods. The PolyJet AM technology uses UV energy to cure layers of photopolymer that are stacked {{one on top of}} the following. The amount of energy that reaches each layer is related to several aspects of the manufacturing procedure, such as jetting head displacement strategy or UV irradiation pattern. This work aims to analyse the relative influence of configuration parameters on the relaxation modulus E(t) of flat parts manufactured using PolyJet technology and orientated on the XY plane. Evolution of material properties with respect to time has been used since parts shall present viscoelastic behaviour. Four factors have been evaluated: part spacing along X axis (Δx) and along the Y axis (Δy), orientation of the <b>part</b> within the <b>tray</b> (φ) and surface quality (Q). Influence of Q has been included since material properties could be modified by UV shielding effect. Experimental results have pointed out that Y-spacing and orientation φ both affect E(t) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{occasional}} {{structural failure}} of distillation and absorption trays operating at low vapour rates has been attributed {{in the literature}} to fatigue of <b>tray</b> <b>parts</b> caused by flow-induced vibration. We suggest that synchronous oscillation of gas flow through tray perforations can occur when the perforations are evenly spaced, and the velocity through them is not too high. The controlling mechanism {{is that of a}} Helmholtz resonator, in which an oscillating mass of liquid near to each perforation cyclically exchanges kinetic energy with potential energy (head) in the bulk liquid across the tray. The rate of exchange is limited by the wave speed in the bulk liquid. A correlation scheme is suggested for the oscillation frequency based on literature data. We show that effective elastic constants can be calculated for perforated tray panels, and draw attention to the stress concentration around holes near the tray edge that exposes trays to fatigue cracking during vibration. Vibration analysis of an idealised tray structure identified the first 30 modes with resonant frequencies between 25 and 70 Hz, the range where excitation by flow-induced pressure pulsations is possible. Recommendations are made to avoid vibrational damage caused by such pulsations...|$|R
30|$|The fate of {{the extra}} {{cannulated}} screw which {{is used as a}} tap may depend on where you practice. In the USA, it is common hospital practice to discard any screw that is inserted into the body, even if it is immediately removed. This is due to concern that the screw may be weakened by insertion, e.g., if it is rubbing against the side of a plate during insertion. This practice is common in the USA during open reduction internal fixation of long bone fractures; a screw that is inserted and found to be too long or too short, is commonly discarded and replaced. However, {{in other parts of the}} world, this practice is less common, and a screw that is inserted briefly and removed can be recirculated into the tray to be used for another case. A third option is to select one long cannulated screw to be used as the ‘tap screw’ and keep it separate from the implant screws along with the instrument <b>part</b> of the <b>tray,</b> to be used over and over again, in a similar way as a tap is repeatedly used. Finally creating a special instrument (tap) supplied by the company is a good concept that could be considered by the instrument manufacturers.|$|R

This was confirmed by the part number on the stabiliser, 65C25746-76, which matched that of components on the missing 737. The fisherman received a reward of 50 million rupiah (equivalent to about $5,500) for his discovery. Later, other parts of the aircraft, including passenger seats, life jackets, a food <b>tray,</b> <b>part</b> of an aircraft tire, eight pieces of aluminium and fibre, an ID card, a flare and a headrest were also recovered from the area.

The total count of recovered objects associated with aircraft, as of 29 January, was 206, of which 194 were definitely from the 737. On 15 January, an unidentified fuel spill was spotted by the Singaporean reconnaissance aircraft along the western coast of Sulawesi, but by the time a ship arrived to attempt to determine whether the spill came from the aircraft, it had been moved by strong currents. Although it was searched for, it was not relocated.

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{experimental work}} on sieve trays in an air-water simulator, 2. 44 m in diameter. The liquid flow pattern, for flowrates {{similar to those}} used in commercial scale distillation, was observed experimentally by water cooling experiments, in which the temperature of the water is measured at over 100 positions over the tray area. The water is cooled by the rising air which is forced through the tray. A heat and mass transfer analogy is drawn whereby the water temperature is mapped to liquid concentration in mass transfer, and the water temperature profiles reveal how liquid channelling may reduce the tray efficiency. The first experiment was to observe the flow of water only over an unperforated tray. With the exception of very low weir loads, the flow separated at the ends of the inlet downcomer. This caused liquid to flow straight across the tray between the downcomers and large circulating regions to be formed in the side regions of the tray. The effect of the air crossflow on the flow pattern was then observed on a sieve tray of 10 % free area with 1 mm diameter holes (such as is used in cryogenic distillation). The flow patterns developed on the tray were similar to those produced with water only on the unperforated tray, but at low weir loads the air crossflow prevented separation of the water flow and the associated circulating regions. At higher weir loads, liquid channelling down the centre of the tray and circulation in the side regions occurred. The percentage of the tray occupied by circulating liquid depended upon the velocity of the liquid entering the tray, which was set by the weir load and size of the gap under the inlet downcomer. The water cooling experiments showed that the temperature of the water in a circulating region is much lower than in other <b>parts</b> of the <b>tray,</b> indicating that the driving force for heat transfer is reduced. In a column section where trays (and circulating areas) are mounted on top of each other, the circulating regions will cause air (or vapour) passing through them to have a reduced change in temperature or concentration leading a loss in tray efficiency...|$|R

It happen'd, when a plague broke out, (Which therefore made them more devout,) The king of brutes (to make it plain, Of quadrupeds I only mean) By proclamation gave command, That every subject in the land Should to the priest confess their sins; And thus the pious Wolf begins: Good father, I must own with shame, That often I have been to blame: I must confess, on Friday last, Wretch that I was! I broke my fast: But I defy the basest tongue To prove I did my neighbour wrong; Or ever went to seek my food, By rapine, theft, or thirst of blood. [...] The Ass approaching next, confess'd, That in his heart he loved a jest: A wag he was, he needs must own, And could not let a dunce alone: Sometimes his friend he would not spare, And might perhaps be too severe: But yet the worst that could be said, He was a wit both born and bred; And, if it be a sin and shame, Nature alone must bear the blame: One fault he has, is sorry for't, His ears are half a foot too short; Which could he to the standard bring, He'd show his face before the king: Then for his voice, there's none disputes That he's the nightingale of brutes. [...] The Swine with contrite heart allow'd, His shape and beauty made him proud: In diet was perhaps too nice, But gluttony was ne'er his vice: In every turn of life content, And meekly took what fortune sent: Inquire through all the parish round, A better neighbour ne'er was found; His vigilance might some displease; 'Tis true, he hated sloth like pease. [...] The mimic Ape began his chatter, How evil tongues his life bespatter; Much of the censuring world complain'd, Who said, his gravity was feign'd: Indeed, the strictness of his morals Engaged him in a hundred quarrels: He saw, and he was grieved to see't, His zeal was sometimes indiscreet: He found his virtues too severe For our corrupted times to bear; Yet such a lewd licentious age Might well excuse a stoic's rage. [...] The Goat advanced with decent pace, And first excused his youthful face; Forgiveness begg'd that he appear'd ('Twas Nature's fault) without a beard. 'Tis true, he was not much inclined To fondness for the female kind: Not, as his enemies object, From chance, or natural defect; Not by his frigid constitution; But through a pious resolution: For {{he had made a}} holy vow Of Chastity, as monks do now: Which he resolved to keep for ever hence And strictly too, as doth his reverence.[2] [...] Apply the tale, and you shall find, How just it suits with human kind. Some faults we own; but can you guess? --Why, virtue's carried to excess, Wherewith our vanity endows us, Though neither foe nor friend allows us. [...] The Lawyer swears (you may rely on't) He never squeezed a needy client; And this he makes his constant rule, For which his brethren call him fool; His conscience always was so nice, He freely gave the poor advice; By which he lost, he may affirm, A hundred fees last Easter term; While others of the learned robe, Would break the patience of a Job. No pleader at the bar could match His diligence and quick dispatch; Ne'er kept a cause, he well may boast, Above a term or two at most.

[...] The Chaplain vows, he cannot fawn, Though it would raise him to the lawn: He pass'd his hours among his books; You find it in his meagre looks: He might, if he were worldly wise, Preferment get, and spare his eyes; But owns he had a stubborn spirit. That made him trust alone to merit; Would rise by merit to promotion; Alas! a mere chimeric notion. [...] The Doctor, if you will believe him, Confess'd a sin; (and God forgive him!) Call'd up at midnight, ran to save A blind old beggar from the grave: But see how Satan spreads his snares; He quite forgot to say his prayers. He cannot help it, for his heart, Sometimes to act the parson's part: Quotes from the Bible many a sentence, That moves his patients to repentance; And, when his medicines do no good, Supports their minds with heavenly food: At which, however well intended, He hears the clergy are offended; And grown so bold behind his back, To call him hypocrite and quack. In his own church he keeps a seat; Says grace before and after meat; And calls, without affecting airs, His household twice a-day to prayers. He shuns apothecaries' shops, And hates to cram the sick with slops: He scorns to make his art a trade; Nor bribes my lady's favourite maid. Old nurse-keepers would never hire, To recommend him to the squire; Which others, whom he will not name, Have often practised to their shame. [...] The Statesman tells you, with a sneer, His fault is to be too sincere; And having no sinister ends, Is apt to disoblige his friends. The nation's good, his master's glory, Without regard to Whig or Tory, Were all the schemes he had in view, Yet he was seconded by few: Though some had spread a thousand lies, 'Twas he defeated the excise.[3] 'Twas known, though he had borne aspersion, That standing troops were his aversion: His practice was, in every station: To serve the king, and please the nation. Though hard to find in every case The fittest man to fill a place: His promises he ne'er forgot, But took memorials on the spot; His enemies, for want of charity, Said, he affected popularity: 'Tis true, the people understood, That all he did was for their good; Their kind affections he has tried; No love is lost on either side. He came to court with fortune clear, Which now he runs out every year; Must, at the rate that he goes on, Inevitably be undone: O! if his majesty would please To give him but a writ of ease, Would grant him license to retire, As it has long been his desire, By fair accounts it would be found, He's poorer by ten thousand pound. He owns, and hopes it is no sin, He ne'er was partial to his kin; He thought it base for men in stations, To crowd the court with their relations: His country was his dearest mother, And every virtuous man his brother; Through modesty or awkward shame, (For which he owns himself to blame,) He found the wisest man he could, Without respect to friends or blood; Nor ever acts on private views, When he has liberty to choose. [...] The Sharper swore he hated play, Except to pass an hour away: And well he might; for, to his cost, By want of skill, he always lost; He heard there was a club of cheats, Who had contrived a thousand feats; Could change the stock, or cog a die, And thus deceive the sharpest eye: Nor wonder how his fortune sunk, His brothers fleece him when he's drunk. [...] I own the moral not exact, Besides, the tale is false, in fact; And so absurd, that could I raise up, From fields Elysian, fabling Æsop, I would accuse him to his face, For libelling the four-foot race.
