40|$|Because we {{must often}} make {{decisions}} {{in light of}} imperfect information about our prospective actions, the standard <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>objective</b> obligation must be supplemented with <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> subjective obligation (which evaluate actions {{in light of what}} the agent believes about their circumstances and consequences). The point <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> subjective obligation is to guide agents in making decisions.

I show that there are many decisions for which “reasonable belief” principles can’t be used by the decision-maker, especially in cases in which whether (or how) the agent investigates or deliberates affects the nature of the prospective action itself.

To address {{inadequacy}} of association rules interestingness measure method currently, {{we present a}} novel method to measure interestingness with relatedness among items in frequent itemsets. It firstly computed relatedness between frequent k-itemsets and each subset of frequent 2 -itemsets, which is a linear combination of Complementarity Intensity (CI), Substitutability Intensity (SI) and Mutual Interaction (MI). The mean of relatedness of all frequent 2 -itemsets subsets was regarded as relatedness of frequent k-itemsets. Finally weighted computation method of association rule interestingness was given according to <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>objective</b> interestingness <b>of</b> association rule is inversely proportional to relatedness of frequent itemsets. The method can not only sort rules, but also analyze actual relationship among all items in frequent 2 -itemsets, which is conductive to selection of users on rules...|$|R

40|$|This {{practice}} {{among many}} peoples and {{in accord with}} some religious traditions in northern Africa affects {{hundreds of thousands of}} women.

Some argued for the importance of respecting local customs and beliefs despite the fact that embedded in such practices is the subordination and mutilation of women. I begin with this issue because a well-meaning doctor once asked me whether or not he could perform female circumcision for a woman from another culture who was demanding it because her husband expected it. After rehearsing the usual arguments, the physician then played the trump card: “But she wants it and you ethicists are always telling us to respect the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> autonomy for patients!” In what follows, I would first like to explain how autonomy needs to be understood as a condition of moral choice, but has been misconceived as an independent <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>objective</b> morality.
