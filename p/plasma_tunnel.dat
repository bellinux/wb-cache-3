40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{describe}} the end-to-end model of a <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnel.</b> A <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> is an useful facility for the ground-based experiment of high enthalpy flows including hypersonic flows, because it can provides a similar flow environment which is experienced by a vehicle during hypersonic flights. For the experimental research of high enthalpy flows, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Cologne research facility has an arc heated <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnel,</b> L 3 K. The accurate prediction of flow characteristics {{is very important to}} calibrate measurement devices and choose measurement methods in a <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> experiment. However, it is difficult to understand the detailed flow conditions of a <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnel,</b> because the flow inside a <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> is usually in strong chemical and thermal non-equilibrium state. we numerically simulate a high enthalpy flow inside a <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> using a multi-temperature model and compare with the measured data using CARS method.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the construction of}} the PWK 2 <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnel,</b> which has been constructed {{over the past three years}} at the Institute for Space Systems of the University of Stuttgart under a grant from the Federal Minister for Research and Technology. This system provides a further instrument for simulating the conditions which apply when entering the atmosphere of a planet. The system has been constructed to supplement the PWK 1 <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnel,</b> which until 1989 was the only system available in Europe for investigating heat-protection materials. While the PWK 1 <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> is employed primarily for the purposes of materials development, PWK 2 is to be used primarily for qualifying measuring processes for materials development, simulating the conditions which apply when entering the atmosphere of another planet and developing the plasma sources required for this purpose. Both <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnels</b> are suitable for qualifying oxidation-protected fiber composite ceramics made of C-C, C-SiC and SiC-SiC, and for investigating ablative materials in stagnation point flow. The simulation range of these <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnels</b> is presented and their operational limits are discussed by reference to several planned space missions. It is demonstrated that these <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnels</b> are particularly suitable for qualifying the intended heat-protection materials with regard to chemical resistance under heat. Particular attention is devoted to construction of the system, development of the new plasma source, the qualification of electrostatic and mechanical probes, the design of the Fabry-Perot interferometer and the development of processes to measure the surface temperatures of material specimens. (orig.) Der vorliegende Bericht beschreibt den Aufbau des Plasmawindkanals PWK 2, der am Institut fuer Raumfahrtsysteme der Universitaet Stuttgart mit Foerderung des Bundesministers fuer Forschung und Technologie in den vergangenen drei Jahren aufgebaut wurde. Mit dieser Anlage steht nun ein weiteres Instrument zur Verfuegung, um die Eintrittsbedingungen in die Atmosphaere eines Planeten zu simulieren. Die Anlage wurde als Ergaenzung zum Plasmawindkanal PWK 1 aufgebaut, der bis 1989 die einzig verfuegbare Anlage zur Untersuchung von Hitzeschutzmaterialien in Europa war. Waehrend der Plasmawindkanal PWK 1 hautpsaechlich fuer die Materialentwicklung eingesetzt wird, liegt der Aufgabenschwerpunkt des PWK 2 auf der Qualifikation hierfuer erforderlicher Messverfahren, der Simulation von Eintrittsbedingungen in die Atmosphaere anderer Planeten und der Entwicklung der hierfuer benoetigten Plasmaquellen. Beide Plasmawindkanaele eignen sich zur Qualifikation von oxidationsgeschuetzten Faserverbundkeramiken aus C-C, C-SiC und SiC-SiC und zur Untersuchung ablativer Materialien in Staupunktstroemung. Der Simulationsbereich dieser Plasmawindkanaele wird dargestellt und ihre Einsatzgrenzen werden am Beispiel einiger geplanter Raumflugmissionen diskutiert. Es wird gezeigt, dass sich diese Plasmawindkanaele fuer die Qualifikation der vorgesehenen Hitzeschutzmaterialien hinsichtlich chemischer Beanpsruchung unter Waermelast besonders eignen. Besondere Aufmerksamkeit wird neben dem Aufbau der Anlage, der Neuentwicklung der Plasmaquelle, der Qualifikation von elektrostatischen und mechanischen Sonden, der Auslegung des Fabry-Perot-Interferometers und der Entwicklung von Verfahren zur Messung der Oberflaechentemperatur von Materialproben gewidmet werden.

40|$|Hot {{structure}} design with ceramic matrix composites (CMC) {{which are based}} on carbon fiber reinforced materials like C/C-SiC is a key technology for the development of lightweight thermal protection systems (TPS) of advanced space reentry vehicles. In order to select suitable CMC and protective coating materials, ground based hypersonic flight simulation with <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> test facilities represents a valuable method for qualifying several structure components and to achieve {{a deeper understanding of the}} thermo-chemical interactions at the material’s surface. However, regarding the technical limitations with ground based test facilities it is indispensable to perform real flight testing with CMC structures in terms of validation of new design concepts {{which are based on}} innovative materials. This paper describes a reentry technology experiment – named “KERAMIK” – with its structural components designed and manufactured fully in C/C-SiC material, a special type of CMC developed by DLR. It was successfully flown on the Russian Foton-M 2 mission in June 2005. One of its C/C-SiC panels was partly protected with different coatings. Special attention is paid to an effective two-layer coating system that is based on yttrium silicate and was chosen to improve both oxidation protection and erosion resistance of the C/C-SiC material. Before selected for the flight test, this coating system was extensively tested in <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> facilities. A comparison of the test results with such coated C/C-SiC specimens obtained from test campaigns in different <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> facilities shows two principal approaches for systematic ground based reentry qualification tests...|$|R

The characterization of such materials in a nitrogen/methane atmosphere is of interest. A European ablative material, AQ 60, has been investigated in <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> tests at the IRS <b>plasma</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> PWK 1 using the magnetoplasma dynamic generator RD 5 as plasma source in a nitrogen/methane atmosphere.

The materials included five tin-gage (nominally 0. 025 - or 0. 037 -cm) oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) alloys and two thin-gage (nominally 0. 037 -cm) superalloys. Multiple reentry conditions were simulated through cyclic <b>Plasma</b> Arc <b>Tunnel</b> (PAT) exposure.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of heat fluxes {{is one of}} the key measurement techniques in high enthalpy facilities, since heat fluxes are important quantities for judging the quality of a thermal protection system. Furthermore, heat flux measurements are widely used for flow characterization.

Recently, a probe for stagnation point heat flux measurements, based on a “slug sensor” has been designed and realized.

40|$|MINI-IRENE is the Flight Demonstrator (FD) of IRENE, a new-concept capsule with a {{variable}} geometry, originally conceived by ASI {{to widen the}} range of available platforms to retrieve payloads and/or data from low Earth orbit. The main characteristics of IRENE is the “umbrella-like" deployable front structure that reduces the capsule ballistic coefficient, leading to acceptable heat fluxes, mechanical loads, stability and final descent velocity. The feasibility study of the IRENE deployable re-entry system {{has been carried out}} in 2011. The TPS materials, selected for the nose cone and for the flexible umbrella shield, have preliminarily been tested in the SPES hypersonic wind tunnel at the University of Naples, and in the SCIROCCO <b>Plasma</b> Wind <b>Tunnel</b> at CIRA. Such successful tests and the preliminary experimental results proved the concept feasibility and the viability of commercial materials for lowcost re-entry nacelles. After the preparation phases A and B were successfully completed, the European Space Agency funded the current phase of the program. The object is to design and built a Flight Demonstrator and a Ground Demonstrator to prove, with a suborbital flight and with a <b>Plasma</b> Wind <b>Tunnel</b> (PWT) test campaign, the functionality of the deployable heat shield. The Flight Demonstrator shall be included as a secondary payload in the interstage adapter of a VSB- 30 launcher from ESRANGE.

A test condition which could be set in both facilities was used to test a C/C based material coated with two different SiC layers and a glass coating to gain information about the impact of the different types of plasma generation on this kind of material. The erosion rates in the thermal arcjet were lower than in the MPG facility although the heat flux necessary to reach the required surface temperature on the sample was significantly higher in the arcjet facility. An additional test series was performed in the MPG wind tunnel to study the influence of a composition of different protection layers made of candidate compounds for use in high-temperature TPS applications. It was found that at low temperatures and low pressures the silica based protection layer was unable to protect from substrate erosion by means of crack sealing. At higher temperatures this feature improved but erosion of the silica layer increased. The combination of a conversion SiC layer and a CVD-SiC layer revealed promising results in terms of their mechanical properties as well as their protective function against oxidation. Erosion of the C/C substrate was found to be particularly severe if a crack within the coating led down onto the graphite matrix between the fibers. It was also shown that self-passivation of a material may be strongly impeded by the high speed, high enthalpy environment typical for re-entry flight. Tests performed in a static facility revealed a different behavior of the material, the reason for which has to be analyzed in detail. (orig.)

Examples in which in situ data on the interaction between satellites and the ionospheric plasma have been elucidated by the laboratory results are presented, and include evidence for a midwake axial ion peak, and ion current density in the near-wake region. The application of the ionospheric laboratory to basic space plasma physics is discussed, and its application to some types of solar system plasma phenomena is illustrated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We report {{studies of}} {{amplification}} {{arising from the}} dynamics of electron plasmawaves in a high electronmobility tran-sistor (HEMT) channel with injection from the gate exhibiting neg-ative differential conductance (NDC). The gate NDC can be real-ized in a resonant tunnel diode (RTD) gate structure integrated in the HEMT. Though the electron plasma wave by itself cannot enable amplification, when coupled with gate NDC, they together form a gain medium at terahertz (THz) frequencies due to the higher plasma wave group velocity than the electron drift velocity. The analysis is developed using a distributed circuit model based on the Dyakonov–Shur hydrodynamic theory. Numerical and an-alytical results suggest that these devices can realize power ampli-fication with a gain exceeding 5 dB while simultaneously providing conditional stability at THz frequencies.
