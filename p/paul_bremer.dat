25|$|On 13 July 2003, an Iraqi Governing Council was {{appointed}} by Coalition Provisional Authority Administrator L. <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer.</b>|$|E
25|$|When Coalition Provisional Authority chief {{executive}} <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer</b> {{took control of}} Iraq in 2003 he issued a series of decrees that restored the Iraqi criminal code back to the Iraq penal code of 1968 (as revised in 1988).|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} to his predecessors <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer</b> and John Negroponte in Baghdad, Khalilzad {{was considered a}} success as US Ambassador and credited with bringing a cultural sophistication and human touch to the job that helped connect with Iraqis.|$|E

5000|$|Seven years later, Davis {{applied for}} a 20-month [...] "leave of absence" [...] from the prison which was granted on November 3, 1932. Such {{leniency}} was common in Oklahoma during that time, even with such a criminal record as his, although Alvin Karpis later claimed that the state's decision was influenced by a $1,500 bribe. He was scheduled {{to return to the}} prison on July 1, 1934, but Davis went on the run instead. A month after his release, he reunited with girlfriend Edna Murray, who herself had escaped from prison for a third time. The couple joined the Alvin Karpis-Barker Gang who were then at the peak of their success {{and in the midst of}} a major crime spree. Davis and Murray were later implicated in the kidnapping of St. <b>Paul</b> banker Edward <b>Bremer</b> who was successfully ransomed for $200,000.|$|R
5000|$|In 1933, on {{the same}} weekend as the Kansas City Massacre, they kidnapped William Hamm, a millionaire Minnesota brewer. His ransom netted them $100,000. Shortly after this, they {{abducted}} St. <b>Paul</b> banker Edward <b>Bremer,</b> whose ransom brought them $200,000.The kidnappings, however, led to the gang's end. The father of the kidnapped Edward Bremer {{was a friend of}} President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt had even mentioned the kidnapping in one of his fireside chats, and fueled also by the Lindbergh kidnapping, the FBI and local police bureaus greatly stepped up their pursuit of those engaged in these types of crimes. The FBI had by this time organized a group of highly skilled agents called the [...] "flying squads," [...] which specialized in hunting down the leading public enemies, and they had been very effective. The year 1934 alone saw the deaths of John Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde, Charles [...] "Pretty Boy" [...] Floyd, Lester [...] "Baby Face Nelson" [...] Gillis, John [...] "Red" [...] Hamilton, Homer Van Meter, Tommy Carroll, and Eddie Green.|$|R
25|$|On March 28, the US {{overseer}} of Iraq, <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer,</b> {{ordered the}} 60-day closure of Al-Hawza, a newspaper published by Muqtada al-Sadr’s group, on {{the charges of}} inciting violence against the occupation. The next day thousands of Iraqis rallied outside the offices of Al-Hawza {{in support of the}} newspaper.|$|E

Past {{speakers}} have included Salman Rushdie, Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Film Maker Spike Lee, Maziar Bahari, Bob Woodward, Elie Wiesel, <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer,</b> Dr. Jack Kevorkian, Desmond Tutu, and Tenzin Gyatso, The 14th Dalai Lama.|$|E
25|$|On 13 December 2003, in Operation Red Dawn, Saddam Hussein was {{captured}} by American forces after being found hiding in {{a hole in the}} ground near a farmhouse in ad-Dawr, near Tikrit. Following his capture, Saddam was transported to a U.S. base near Tikrit, and later taken to the American base near Baghdad. On 14 December, U.S. administrator in Iraq L. <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer</b> confirmed that Saddam Hussein had indeed been captured at a farmhouse in ad-Dawr near Tikrit. Bremer presented video footage of Saddam in custody.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{supervision}} of chief executive of Coalition Provisional Authority L. <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer,</b> a convention was held on 24 May 2003 to select the first City Council {{in the history of}} this oil-rich, ethnically divided city. Each of the city's four major ethnic groups was invited to send a 39-member delegation from which they would be allowed to select six to sit on the City Council. Another six council members were selected from among 144 delegates to represent independents social groups such as teachers, lawyers, religious leaders and artists.|$|E
25|$|Various American {{commanders and}} ambassadors have been {{referred}} to as proconsuls. Writer Carnes Lord discusses William Howard Taft in the Philippines (1900–1903); Leonard Woodward in Cuba; Lucius D. Clay in Germany; Douglas Mac Arthur in Korea; Edward Lansdale in Vietnam; Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., ambassador to Vietnam in 1963–1964; Creighton Abrams, who commanded in the Vietnam War from 1968 to 1972; Ellsworth Butler, ambassador in Vietnam in 1967–1973; William Colby and Ellsworth Bunker in Vietnam; Wesley Clark in Bosnia in 1994–99, Lewis <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer</b> in Iraq in 2003; and David Petraeus in Iraq in 2004–08 and in Afghanistan in 2010–11.|$|E
25|$|The Terrorists of Iraq: Inside the Strategy and Tactics of the Iraq Insurgency 2003–2014 traces {{terrorist}} {{roots of}} the insurgency within Iraq which yielded {{the development of the}} later terrorist group known as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). The author faults the decision to begin the 2003 Iraq war by the Bush Administration as the impetus for subsequent chaos within the region. Nance notes the Iraq war was supported by a false premise, and elaborates that subsequent chaos in the country was exacerbated by mismanagement from individuals including <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer,</b> provisional leader of the country while the war was still ongoing.|$|E
25|$|The zoological park {{used to be}} {{the largest}} in the Middle East. Within eight days {{following}} the 2003 invasion, however, only 35 of the 650 animals in the facility survived. This was a result of theft of some animals for human food, and starvation of caged animals that had no food. South African Lawrence Anthony and some of the zoo keepers cared for the animals and fed the carnivores with donkeys they had bought locally. Eventually, L. <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer,</b> Director of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq from 11 May 2003 to 28 June 2004 ordered protection of the zoo and U.S. engineers helped to reopen the facility.|$|E
25|$|The Terrorists of Iraq: Inside the Strategy and Tactics of the Iraq Insurgency 2003–2014 is a non-fiction {{book about}} the Iraqi insurgency, written by U.S. Navy retired {{cryptology}} analyst Malcolm Nance. It was published by CRC Press in 2014. The book discusses terrorist evolution of the Iraqi insurgency {{which led to the}} formation of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). Nance cites the 2003 Iraq war by the Bush Administration for causing regional instability. He criticizes Coalition Provisional Authority leader <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer.</b> The book emphasizes lessons the U.S. neglected to learn from the Vietnam War, the Iraqi revolt against the British, and the South Lebanon conflict. Nance writes in favor of the Iran nuclear deal framework by the Obama Administration, saying it is in the interests of all parties involved.|$|E
500|$|The {{main reason}} behind this order was the {{coverage}} by the Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya television networks. The two networks had the only {{access to the}} city. They repeatedly reported that Marines were using excessive force and collective punishment, and their footage of dead babies in hospitals inflamed both Iraqi and world opinion. General Conway later summed up their effect on the battle by saying, [...] "Al Jazeera kicked our ass." [...] When the 2nd Iraqi Battalion was ordered to Fallujah, 30 percent of its soldiers refused or deserted, and within days over 80 percent of the police force and Iraqi National Guard in Anbar Province had deserted. After {{two members of the}} Iraqi Governing Council resigned over the attack and five more threatened to do so, CPA Leader <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer</b> and CENTCOM commander General John Abizaid were worried that Fallujah might bring down the Iraqi government and ordered a unilateral ceasefire.|$|E

2500|$|Steven E. Moore, who {{conducted}} survey research in Iraq for the Coalition Provisional Authority {{and was an}} advisor to <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer</b> for the International Republican Institute, ridiculed the Lancet study in an October 18, 2006 editorial in the Wall Street Journal. In a piece entitled, [...] "655,000 War Dead? A bogus study on Iraq casualties", Moore wrote, [...] "I wouldn't survey a junior high school, no less an entire country, using only 47 cluster points. Neither would anyone else..." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the General's {{major public}} works was the {{restoration}} and re-opening of the University of Mosul. Petraeus strongly supported {{the use of}} commanders' discretionary funds for public works, telling Coalition Provisional Authority director L. <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer</b> [...] "Money is ammunition" [...] during the director's first visit to Mosul. Petraeus's often repeated catchphrase was later incorporated into official military briefings and was also eventually incorporated into the U.S. Army Counterinsurgency Field Manual drafted with Petraeus's oversight.|$|E
2500|$|On February 5, 2005 the IRIN {{issued a}} report titled [...] "Iraq: Male {{homosexuality}} still a taboo." [...] The article stated, among other things, that [...] "honor killings" [...] by Iraqis against a gay family member are common and given some legal protection. [...] The article also stated that the 2001 amendment to the criminal code stipulating {{the death penalty for}} homosexuality [...] "has not been changed", even through <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer</b> clearly ordered the criminal code to go back to its 1980s edition.|$|E
2500|$|Vice President Cheney, {{there have}} been new {{developments}} in Iraq, especially {{having to do with}} the administration's handling. <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer,</b> the former head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, gave a speech in which he said that we have never had enough troops on the ground, or we've never had enough troops on the ground. Donald Rumsfeld said he has not seen any hard evidence of a link between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. Was this approved [...] of a report that you requested that you received a week ago that showed there was no connection between Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and Saddam Hussein? ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2003, <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer</b> {{announced}} {{the plan to}} hand over limited sovereignty to the Iraqi governing council by 30 June 2004. A draft constitution was written {{and approved by the}} Iraqi Governing Council in March 2004. [...] The United States has stated its plans to enter into what it calls a security agreement with the new Iraqi government and maintain military authority until a new Iraqi army is established. The Bush administration remained committed to this date despite the unstable security situation. The interim Iraqi government was named in May 2004, at which point the Iraqi Governing Council was dissolved, though there was heavy overlap between the two governing bodies.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq the Iraqi Army {{was defeated in}} a number of battles, including by Task Force Viking in the north, and the Battle of Nasiriyah and the Battle of Baghdad. The Iraqi Army was disbanded by Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 2 issued by U.S. Administrator of Iraq <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer</b> on May 23, 2003 after its decisive defeat during the Second Gulf War. Bremer said that it was not feasible to reconstitute the armed forces. [...] His justifications for the disbandment included postwar looting, which had destroyed all the bases; that the largely Shiite draftees of the army would not respond to a recall plea from their former commanders, who were primarily Sunnis, and that recalling the army would be a political disaster because to the vast majority of Iraqis it was a symbol of the old Baathist-led Sunni ascendancy..." ...|$|E
2500|$|L. <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer</b> was {{the leader}} of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq. As the {{appointed}} authority, Bremer wanted national elections to take place only after the creation of a constitution that included basic principles about the election process. This led to the delay of the elections, which led to serious problems. It was during this time that the power vacuum within Baghdad was being filled by a Shi'a cleric, a factor that Bremer failed to take into account. Insurgency among Sunni civilians first became a problem when American troops first became a presence on Iraqi soil. This insurgency led to Bremer kicking all the Sunni Ba'thists out the Iraqi administration and the disbandment of the Iraqi army, which only prompted a harsh response from the American troops. This was a very poor decision on Bremer's part, according to Sánchez, who viewed the insurgency as mostly provoked by Bremer. He is quoted as saying, ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics of {{ties between}} Iraq Study Group members and oil {{companies}} were {{highly critical of}} the report's recommendations to privatize the Iraqi oil industry. Author Antonia Juhasz argued that this recommendation amounted to a call for [...] "extending the war in Iraq to ensure that US oil companies get what the Bush administration went in there for: control and greater access to Iraq's oil." [...] Similarly, activist Tom Hayden noted that the Iraq Study Group represents the interests of the US oil industry. James A. Baker, III's law firm has interests in debt repayment to Kuwait and other Gulf States. Lawrence S. Eagleburger has ties to Halliburton and Phillips Petroleum, and is a former head of Kissinger Associates, a corporate consulting firm. (<b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer</b> was managing partner of Kissinger Associates.) Vernon E. Jordan, Jr. is a lawyer at Akin Gump who is closely associated with the Bilderberg Group. The expert working groups for the ISG include leaders of Bechtel, two representatives of Citigroup, and , an energy consulting firm.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2003, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, Kerik was {{appointed}} by the George W. Bush administration as interim Interior Minister of Iraq and senior policy adviser to U.S. presidential envoy to Iraq, L. <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer</b> III. [...] When Kerik arrived in Iraq the Ministry of Interior did not exist, having collapsed and dissolved during the U.S.–led coalition's invasion of Iraq. [...] Kerik was responsible for restructuring and rebuilding the ministry and all its constituent parts: the national police, intelligence service, and border and customs police, as well as choosing the officials who would take control of these institutions when he left. [...] Prior to Kerik's departure from Iraq on September 2, 2003, more than 35,000 Iraqi police were reinstated, 35 police stations were stood up in Baghdad with several more around the country, the senior deputy interior ministers were appointed, and the newly established governing council appointed the first Iraqi minister of interior, post–Saddam Hussein, Nouri Badran. [...] A United Nations UNODC fact-finding mission report dated May 18, 2003 {{at the beginning of}} his term, noted that Kerik's team made [...] "positive interventions in a number of areas." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, on May 11, 2003, the Bush Administration {{established}} the [...] "Coalition Provisional Authority" [...] (CPA) {{to take control}} of Iraq's domestic affairs away from the US military. Twelve days later, <b>Paul</b> <b>Bremer,</b> head of the CPA, issued an order dissolving the entire Iraqi military, as well as most civilian employees of the old government, and pledged to build a new military and government from scratch. One [...] "untainted by any ties to Saddam's regime," [...] according to the CPA. The Iraqi army’s abrupt end, against the protests of many US field commanders, sparked immediate rioting among former Iraqi soldiers. In addition to broader civil unrest as unemployment skyrocketed to 70% and practically every government service, from the police to trash collectors, ended without warning. Soon, large numbers of former Iraqi military personnel allied with the surviving Ba'ath loyalists and formed guerrilla units, igniting an eight-year insurgency against Coalition forces. Besides scattered attacks in Baghdad, these insurgents began to focus on taking and holding ground in and around Mosul, Tikrit and Fallujah. In the fall of 2003, these largely secular units were joined by religiously motivated [...] "Jihadists" [...] insurgents, both foreign and domestic. With the growing influence of religious fanatics, the insurgency's mostly traditional tactics of sniping, small unit ambushes and planting roadside improvised explosive devices against foreign military personnel began transforming into frequent suicide bombings and death squads targeting civilians that were perceived as [...] "loyal" [...] to coalition forces.|$|E
