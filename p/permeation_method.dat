40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the inhibitory effect of plant extracts, Ocimum sanctum, Aegle marmelos, and Solanum trilobatum, on the corrosion of mild steel in 1 N HCl medium was investigated using weightloss method, electrochemical methods, and hydrogen <b>permeation</b> <b>method.</b> Polarization method indicates plant extracts behave as mixed-type inhibitor. The impedance method reveals that charge-transfer process mainly controls the corrosion of mild steel.

40|$|Hydrogen ion {{diffusion}} in {{silicon nitride}} thin film is of significant interest {{because of its}} importance in barrier, sensor and catalytic coating applications. In this study, a novel method based on potential-pH response measurement {{was used to determine}} hydrogen ion diffusion in silicon nitride thin films. Hydrogen ion diffusion coefficient in silicon nitride films obtained from this method was 1 x 10 (- 19) cm(2) /S. A potential-pH response drift was observed and is believed to be due to the presence of a hydrated layer affecting the hydrogen ion diffusion onto the nitride film of the Si 3 N 4 -gate hydrogen ion-sensitive field effect transistors (ISFETs). The unique feature of the potential-pH response method is its relatively simple experimental procedure, which eliminates complications arising from surface-related effects and/or presence of hydrogen traps in membrane, such as those found in the conventional <b>permeation</b> <b>method.</b> The method also offers a considerable test time reduction, with the experiment being completed in 10 h as compared to the conventional electrochemical <b>permeation</b> <b>method</b> which takes as long as 5 days.

40|$|The barrier {{properties}} of one treated paper packaging and one standard plastic film (bi-oriented polypropylene, biOPP) were assessed for ethyl hexanoate. Three methods based either on sorption (gravimetry and micro-atmosphere-derived method) or permeation kinetic determination {{were used in}} controlled conditions of aroma vapor concentration (107 Pa), temperature (25 degrees C) and relative humidity (about 0 %). Ethyl hexanoate solubility values {{were on the same}} range of magnitude for both packaging films in spite of their different nature and composition. Ethyl hexanoate affinity for both films was well predicted by their respective solubility parameters. Solubility values were different according to the experimental method used. The micro-atmosphere-derived method and the <b>permeation</b> <b>method</b> both presented experimental limitations for the solubility determination. Ethyl hexanoate diffusivity values were significantly different between the three methods used. Particularly, the values were 10 -folds higher by the <b>permeation</b> <b>method</b> than by the sorption methods for the treated paper. Whatever the method, ethyl hexanoate diffusivity was always higher through the treated paper than through the biOPP. Ethyl hexanoate permeability was controlled by diffusivity for both films and probably linked to the evolution of the film structure during transfer. Permeability could thus not be calculated from the product of diffusivity and solubility coefficient...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{mechanical}} and deformation characteristics of mass concrete are considerably improved by adding long structural fibres. This addition, however, {{does not always}} extend the durability of concrete. One of the key factors {{in the evaluation of}} durability of fibre concretes is the assessment of permeability of their surface layer using one of the non-destructive methods. In this research, three of these methods were used: two <b>permeation</b> <b>methods</b> with a gaseous medium, TORRENT and CO 2 permeability method, and the British ISAT with a liquid medium, on the grounds of their simplicity of application and their possible combinability. The test results show that both TORRENT and ISAT methods can be used to assess the durability of both concrete and fibre concrete with dense aggregate. In the case of concrete containing concrete recyclate, however, the TORRENT method was not effective. Also the method of determining the permeability for CO 2 was not suitable for the concrete with concrete recyclate. Even for other concretes this method was too complicated and too dependent on the marginal conditions of the measurement...|$|R

In addition, the solubility and permeability of the pure gases in the polyimide membranes were also measured by sorption and <b>permeation</b> <b>methods.</b> The results showed that NMR measurements on pure gases are very reproducible and in relatively good agreement with those determined by the other methods.

A physiological solution was used as receiving phase and the cobalt powder was dispersed in synthetic sweat. The amount of metal passing through the skin was analysed by electro-thermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). Parallel polarographic analysis (differential pulse polarography—DPP) allowed evaluation of cobalt present as ions (Co 2 +) in donor and receiving phases. Measurements of cobalt skin content were also performed. Results Evaluation of metal in the receiving phase allowed us to demonstrate the permeation of cobalt through the skin. Steady-state flow of percutaneous cobalt permeation was calculated as 0. 0123 ± 0. 0054 mgrg cm– 2 h– 1, with a lag time of 1. 55 ± 0. 71 h.

40|$|New drug {{entities}} (NDE) {{are constantly}} being developed with most of them intended for oral administration. For this reason, {{there is a need}} to estimate their absorption in order to save time and money that would be lost if the drug enters the clinical stage and is then found to exhibit poor absorption. For many years, the use of animals was the most abundant method for studying pharmacokinetics to predict parameters such as intestinal absorption. However, these methods are time consuming, and expensive as well as being ethically unfavourable. As a result, developing other methods to evaluate a drug’s pharmacokinetics is crucial. The aim of this work was to develop in vitro methods for estimation of human intestinal absorption (%HIA) to replace the use of the aforementioned, less favourable methods involving the use of animals. Among the developed methods in this thesis is a unique type of chromatography known as micellar liquid chromatography (MLC) using biosurfactants such as bile salts as a mobile phase. Furthermore, studies investigated the effect of a change in the stationary phase in addition to investigating the effect of the change in temperature on the elution of the analysed compounds. It was found that R 2 PRED for the developed MLC methods was in the range of 43. 3 % - 91. 12 %. Another developed method was a spectrophotometric method based on the use of the solubilising effects of bile salts, as well as their binding to compounds. Therefore, two spectrophotometric methods were developed, a solubilisation method and a double reciprocal method, and used in the prediction of %HIA. It was found that the solubilisation method had a better predictability for %HIA than that of the double reciprocal method where R 2 PRED was found to be 82. 32 % and 61. 90 % respectively. Finally, a <b>permeation</b> <b>method</b> was developed using the ability of NaDC to form a hydrogel under specific conditions and applying the investigated drugs in an infinite dose to the prepared hydrogels. This facilitated the determination of permeability coefficients (Kp) that were then used in the prediction of %HIA using the obtained model. The two developed permeation methods were found to have close values of R 2 PRED for % HIA where R 2 PRED of the <b>permeation</b> <b>method</b> using flow through cells was found to be 79. 8 % while that of the <b>permeation</b> <b>method</b> using Franz cells was found to be 79. 67 %.

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{the interaction of}} auxins with membrane fractions prepared from etiolated epicotyl tissue of ‘Pisum Sativum’ seedling. The interaction of auxins with phospholipids was also examined. Two classes of high affinity binding tissue sites {{were found in the}} growing region of the epicotyl tissue. Kinetic analysis of the data resulted in dissociation constant values of: K[sub] 1 = 2. 2 x 10 [sup]- 7 M, n[sub] 1 = 1. 8 x 10 [sup]- 10 moles/g fresh wt; K[sub] 2 = 11 x 10 [sup]- 7 M, n[sub] 2 = 3 x 10 [sup]- 10 moles/g fresh wt. These sites were not found in the non-growing region of the pea epicotyl suggesting that they may be involved in the growth process. From the competition studies reported here, it would appear that site 2 showed greater auxin specificity than site 1 and this could be considered a candidate as an auxin receptor. Sucrose gradient fractionation techniques were employed to further separate the two binding sites and it was shown that site 2 binding was associated with fractions rich in plasma membrane while site 1 was associated with the endoplasmic reticulum.
