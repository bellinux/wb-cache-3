However, frequent operation of relay selection can bring enormous control message overhead and thereby decrease the performance of cooperative communication. To reduce the relay selection frequency, in this paper, we propose a relay selection scheme to choose the best relay with considering successive <b>packets</b> <b>transmission.</b> In this scheme, {{according to the length}} of data packet, data transmission rate and the estimated channel state information (CSI), the best relay is selected to maximize the number of successive <b>packets</b> <b>transmission</b> under the condition that the given symbol-error-rate (SER) is kept. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed relay selection scheme can support the operation of successive <b>packets</b> <b>transmission</b> in cooperative wireless networks and that the maximum number of successive <b>packets</b> <b>transmission</b> is affected by the different network parameters, i. e., data transmission rate, packet length and Doppler frequency at one relay node...|$|E

The data <b>packet</b> <b>transmission</b> success rate of sensor nodes of three different MAC protocols was disproportional to the transmission rate (refer to Fig.  3 a).

In a condition where the penetration of PUs’ activity is high, SUs might {{have only a}} few vacant channels for their <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions.</b> Thus, they should manage their <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions</b> efficiently, possibly by reducing the number of control <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions</b> and focusing on data <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions.</b> On-demand protocols do not require periodic control packet exchanges, but they broadcast and unicast control packets in the route discovery and route maintenance procedures for active routes. In other words, by eliminating periodic control packet exchanges, on-demand protocols reduce the number of <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions</b> required by SUs. Some routing protocols based on on-demand routing in CRAHNs, such as the connectivity-based routing [17], CAODV [18], and D 2 CARP [19], add the control <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions.</b> They discover multiple paths during the route discovery.

40|$|A new network {{architecture}} which uses several wavelengths as control channels for co-ordination of packet transmissions on data channels for single-hop WDMA networks and passive star topology is introduced in this paper. The presented multiwavelength control architecture distributes control information over the total control channels and {{in conjunction with}} a suitable network interface, reduces the headers electronic processing bottleneck at each end station. Also, the access schemes decrease the contention on data channels by avoiding part of the data channel collision. Some cases of multiple access protocols for asynchronous and synchronous (re) transmission categories are suggested. The proposed schemes adopt the slotted ALOHA protocol for the access to control and data multichannel systems in which the data <b>packets</b> <b>transmission</b> starts immediately after the control <b>packets</b> <b>transmission.</b> An analytic model is developed and analysed for performance measures evaluation based on Poisson approximations statistics and a finite population.

The obtained voice spectral efficiency is also compared with existent PMR networks and global system for mobile communications (GSM). The realistic system model considers both transmission protocols overhead, including internet protocol (IP) and robust header compression (ROHC), and air frame overhead. As LTE is not designed for low bit rate voice communications, we propose to optimize the layer one transmission parameters. We modify the standard algorithm by calculating the minima normalized values for both coding rate and transport block size, considering radio allocation possibilities. The newly computed values are optima for PMR voice transmission. The LTE voice communications capacity is given for the realistic and ideal values of the protocol stack overhead. The realistic results are compared to GSM and PMR voice spectral efficiencies, with the appropriate voice coders. LTE Release 9 seems promising for future data transfers, but is not yet favourable to voice services. Even though the air frame is highly configurable, the protocol stack overhead and the standard resource allocation constraints are not designed for real-time voice <b>packets</b> <b>transmission.</b> The ROHC compressed protocol overhead remains large for voice frames and demands important air resources.
