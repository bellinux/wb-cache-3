40|$|Weight bearing {{asymmetry}} (WBA) during dynamic tasks is {{prevalent in}} a variety of clinical populations. However, accurate measurement has previously been out of reach of the clinician due to the costly equipment and technical expertise required. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the test-retest reliability of WBA data obtained using an inexpensive and simple to use dual force plate system incorporating unmodified Nintendo Wii Balance Boards (NWBB) and customized software. A secondary outcome measure, individual limb COP <b>path</b> <b>velocity,</b> which represents the postural sway under each limb was also examined. Twenty-three participants performed squats both with and without visual WBA feedback on two separate occasions. Weight-bearing asymmetry as a percentage of body mass and individual limb center of pressure (COP) <b>path</b> <b>velocity</b> were recorded during these trials, with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 2, 1) analysis performed to assess test-retest reliability. This system provided reliable values for both outcome measures when performed with and without real-time visual feedback of WBA (ICC 2, 1 range= 0. 75 - 0. 91). In conclusion, recording WBA and COP <b>path</b> <b>velocity</b> data using NWBB is reliable. Given that tens of millions of NWBB have been sold worldwide, and that reprogramming them for clinical purposes is within the reach of most software developers, similar systems may soon become commonplace in the clinical setting. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a Model Predictive Control (MPC) {{framework}} based on <b>path</b> <b>velocity</b> decomposition paradigm for autonomous driving. The optimization underlying the MPC has a two layer structure wherein first, an appropriate path is computed for the vehicle followed by the computation of optimal forward velocity along it. The {{very nature of the}} proposed <b>path</b> <b>velocity</b> decomposition allows for seamless compatibility between the two layers of the optimization. A key feature of the proposed work is that it offloads most of the responsibility of collision avoidance to velocity optimization layer for which computationally efficient formulations can be derived. In particular, we extend our previously developed concept of time scaled collision cone (TSCC) constraints and formulate the forward velocity optimization layer as a convex quadratic programming problem. We perform validation on autonomous driving scenarios wherein proposed MPC repeatedly solves both the optimization layers in receding horizon manner to compute lane change, overtaking and merging maneuvers among multiple dynamic obstacles.

Objective: The main {{purpose of the current}} {{study was to determine the}} effect of different concentrations of Trolox as an antioxidant to freezing-thawing procedure on human sperm kinematic parameter. Materials and Methods: Semen was collected from 20 normal donors and divided into five aliquots prior to cryopreservation. The first aliquot was analyzed by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Other aliquots were mixed with cryo-protective agent containing 0, 20, 40, and 80 μmol Trolox and treated samples were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. After two weeks samples were thawed and sperm motion kinematics was measured by CASA. Percent motility (Mot), curvilinear velocity (VCL), straight-line velocity (VSL), average <b>path</b> <b>velocity</b> (VAP), linearity (LIN), and amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH) were compared before and after freeze. Results: Addition of 40 μmol Trolox resulted in significantly higher (p< 0. 05) post thaw VCL, VSL and VAP compared to other groups.

40|$|OBJECTIVE:: To {{examine how}} {{postural}} control changes following pediatric mild traumatic brain injury. SETTING:: Urban pediatric emergency department. PARTICIPANTS:: Children 11 to 16 years old who presented within 6 hours of sustaining mild traumatic brain injury. DESIGN:: Prospective observational cohort followed for 1 month. MAIN MEASURES:: Total {{center of pressure}} <b>path</b> <b>velocity</b> and <b>path</b> <b>velocity</b> within distinct frequency bands, ranging from moderate to ultralow, were recorded by the Nintendo Wii Balance Board during a 2 -legged stance. Measurements were recorded in 2 separate tests with eyes open and closed. The scores of the 2 tests were compared, and a Romberg quotient was computed. RESULTS:: Eleven children were followed for 1 month postinjury. The ultralow frequency, which reflects slow postural movements associated with exploring stability boundaries, was lower (p =. 02) during the eyes closed stance acutely following injury. The Romberg quotient for this frequency was also significantly lower acutely following injury (p =. 007) than at 1 month. CONCLUSION:: Following mild traumatic brain injury, children acutely demonstrate significantly more rigid sway patterns with eyes closed than with eyes open, which were highlighted by the Romberg quotient. The Romberg quotient could allow for accurate identification and tracking of postural instability without requiring knowledge of preinjury balance ability.

The {{aim of this study}} was to examine what effect anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has on traditional and modern measures of balance. Ninety subjects, 45 who had undergone ACLR and 45 matched controls, performed single leg static standing balance tests on their surgical or matched limb on a Nintendo Wii Balance Board. Data were analysed in the anterior-posterior axis of movement, which is known to be affected by ACLR. The traditional measures of <b>path</b> <b>velocity,</b> amplitude and standard deviation were calculated in this plane. Additionally, sample entropy and discrete wavelet transform derived assessment of <b>path</b> <b>velocity</b> in four distinct frequency bands related to (1) spinal reflexive loops and muscle activity, (2) cerebellar, (3) vestibular, and (4) visual mechanisms of postural control were derived. The ACLR group had significantly increased values in all traditional measures and all four frequency bands. No significant difference was observed for sample entropy. This indicated that whilst postural sway was amplified in the ACLR group, the overall mechanism used by the patient group to maintain balance was similar to that of the control group. In conclusion, modern methods of signal analysis may provide additional insight into standing balance mechanisms in clinical populations.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between stallion fertility and oxidative stress remains poorly understood. The {{purpose of this}} study was to identify criteria for thoroughbred fertility assessment by performing a logistical regression analysis using "dismount" sperm parameters as predictors and weekly per-cycle conception rate as the dependent variable. Paradoxically, positive relationships between fertility and oxidative stress were revealed, such that samples that produced pregnancies exhibited higher rates of 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine release (1490. 2 % vs. 705. 5 pg/ml/ 24 h) and lower vitality (60. 5 % vs. 69. 6 %) and acrosome integrity (40. 2 % vs. 50. 1 %) than those that did not. We hypothesized that the most fertile spermatozoa exhibited the highest levels of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), with oxidative stress simply being a by-product of intense mitochondrial activity. Accordingly, an experiment to investigate the {{relationship between}} oxidative stress and motility was conducted and revealed positive correlations between mitochondrial ROS and total motility (R² = 0. 90), rapid motility (R² = 0. 89), average <b>path</b> <b>velocity</b> (VAP; R² = 0. 59), and curvilinear velocity (VCL; R² = 0. 66). Similarly, lipid peroxidation was positively correlated with total motility (R² = 0. 46), rapid motility (R² = 0. 51), average <b>path</b> <b>velocity</b> (R² = 0. 62), and VCL (R² = 0. 56), supporting the aforementioned hypothesis. The relative importance of OXPHOS in supporting the motility of equine spermatozoa was contrasted with human spermatozoa, which primarily utilize glycolysis. In this study, mitochondrial inhibition significantly reduced the velocity (P < 0. 01) and ATP (P < 0. 05) content of equine, but not human, spermatozoa, emphasizing the former's relative dependence on OXPHOS.

Methods 97 participants (66 males, median age 28 years) 12 months post-ACLR and 48 healthy controls (20 males, median age 30 years) underwent balance assessment using a Nintendo Wii Balance Board during a single-leg squat.
