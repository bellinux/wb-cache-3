(2) How are products meant for men differentiated from products meant for women?

40|$|Background. Social network visual {{shopping}} {{trends are}} growing e-commerce at unprecedented levels. Images {{are used as}} product marketing material; however, image posts are triggering very low consumer behavior and low sales conversion. Objective. To explore how online stores can increase the purchasing prospects of their <b>products</b> using <b>images</b> on social networks. Methods. We introduce a theoretical probabilistic model to estimate consumer behavioral intention and purchasing prospect on social networks, outline parameters that can be exploited to increase click-rate and conversion, and motivate a new strategy to market products online. The model explores increasing online stores’ sales conversion by utilizing a product collection landing page that is marketed to consumers through a single “Hook” image. To implement the model, we developed a novel technological method that enabled online stores to post different “Hook” images on social networks and hyperlink them to the product collection landing pages they created. Results. Stores and marketers developed four types of “Hook” images: themed-collaged <b>product</b> <b>images,</b> single <b>product</b> <b>images,</b> lifestyle images, and model <b>images.</b> Themed-collaged <b>product</b> <b>images</b> accounted for 60 % of consumer traffic from social network sites. Moreover, consumer purchasing click rate increased at least twofold (4. 94 %) {{with the use of}} product collection landing pages...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Large-scale instance-level image {{retrieval}} aims at retrieving specific {{instances of}} objects or scenes. Simultaneously retrieving multi-ple objects {{in a test}} image adds {{to the difficulty of}} the problem, espe-cially if the objects are visually similar. This paper presents an efficient approach for per-exemplar multi-label image classification, which tar-gets the recognition and localization of products in retail store images. We achieve runtime efficiency through the use of discriminative random forests, deformable dense pixel matching and genetic algorithm optimiza-tion. Cross-dataset recognition is performed, where our training images are taken in ideal conditions with only one single training <b>image</b> per <b>product</b> label, while the evaluation set is taken using a mobile phone in real-life scenarios in completely different conditions. In addition, we pro-vide a large novel dataset and labeling tools for <b>products</b> <b>image</b> search, to motivate further research efforts on multi-label retail <b>products</b> <b>image</b> classification. The proposed approach achieves promising results in terms of both accuracy and runtime efficiency on 680 annotated images of our dataset, and 885 test images of GroZi- 120 dataset. We make our dataset of 8350 different <b>product</b> <b>images</b> and the 680 test images from retail stores with complete annotations available to the wider community. ...|$|R
50|$|For {{consumers}} to win, societal marketing must {{provide them with}} compelling benefits that increase their overall welfare. What benefits did societal marketing initiative actually provided to consumers? Are there direct benefits such as increased satisfaction with their interaction with commercial or nonprofit organization?Determining {{whether there is a}} win situation for society by societal marketing initiative is the most difficult question to be answered. We turn to the two questions proposed by Bloom, Hussien and Szykmann (1995): Is the society better off because of this program? Does corporate involvement result in better performance than if it would have been managed by NGOs or government agencies? Societal marketing is becoming globally popular but there exist a scarcity of research in this field. Therefore extensive future research is needed particularly investigating questions with respect to its impact on consumer attitudes to corporate image, <b>product</b> <b>image</b> and their purchase intention or brand choice as well as on positive impact on society.|$|E
