5|$|Kaja Bordevich Ballo (1988– March 28, 2008) was a {{university}} {{student in the}} French town of Nice; her father was Olav Gunnar Ballo, {{a member of the}} Norwegian Parliament. On March 28, 2008 Kaja Ballo took the <b>personality</b> <b>test</b> run by the Church of Scientology, and committed suicide later the same day. Family and friends stated that Ballo was happy prior to taking the test, and that her mood dramatically shifted after receiving the results. She committed suicide hours after getting the results of the test back; Ballo jumped from the fourth floor of her dorm room. In addition to a note, her family found the Scientology <b>personality</b> <b>test</b> among her belongings. French police investigated connections between Scientology and Ballo's death, and interviewed two leaders of the organization in France. Prosecutors stated in December 2008 that they were unable to establish a causative link between the Scientology test and Ballo's death.|$|E

Ron Hubbard, titled Battlefield Earth. Christman repeatedly called the New York City office of MTV in an attempt to get them to stop the satire from airing. In the eventual broadcast, which ran June 8, 2000, the South Park character Cartman was shown using a Scientology <b>personality</b> <b>test</b> as toilet paper. Christman believed she had succeeded in her mission, for she thought that her efforts prevented the book Dianetics from being used by Cartman, instead of the <b>personality</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Personality</b> <b>tests</b> {{have been}} around for a long time, but it wasn't until it became illegal for {{employers}} to use polygraphs that we began to see the widespread use of <b>personality</b> <b>tests.</b> The idea behind these <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> is that employers can reduce their turnover rates and prevent economic losses in the form of people prone to thievery, drug abuse, emotional disorders or violence in the workplace.|$|R
30|$|Potential {{employers}} frequently use <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> {{to screen}} applicants’ suitability for positions within their organizations. Although <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> {{have been around}} since they were adopted by the U.S. military in World War I, their use in the workplace expanded dramatically after 1998 when U.S. federal law banned the use of polygraphs by employers (Stabile 2002). A 2003 survey, for example, found that 30 percent of U.S. companies, ranging from small businesses to major corporations, were using <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> to screen job applicants (Heller 2005). In short, <b>personality</b> <b>testing</b> is big business and is growing rapidly (Hsu 2004).|$|R
5|$|A Scientology {{representative}} in France {{asserted that the}} Scientology <b>personality</b> <b>test</b> was not created by the Church of Scientology, {{and that it was}} not related to Ballo's death. The Church of Scientology's information chief in Norway, Matthias Fosse stated that the test was not dangerous and that the organization did not bear any responsibility for Ballo's death. Ballo's father retained a lawyer to investigate his daughter's death, and the family considered filing a lawsuit against Scientology. 500 people attended Ballo's funeral on April 11, 2008 at Grefsen Church in Oslo, Norway.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} received significant {{media coverage}} in Norway, and Verdens Gang and Dagbladet devoted multiple cover stories to investigating the controversy. The media faced criticism for its extensive coverage of Ballo's death. Norway parliament member Inga Marte Thorkildsen commented {{that she thought}} indications were that Scientology {{had a role in}} Ballo's suicide. Psychologist Rudy Myrvang told Aftenposten that the Scientology <b>personality</b> <b>test</b> was designed to break down an individual; he characterized the test as a form of recruitment tool for the organization. Scientology critic Andreas Heldal-Lund stated parents of those involved in Scientology contacted him with similar concerns. The Norwegian Psychological Association warned individuals against taking such types of personality tests.|$|E

40|$|<b>Personality</b> <b>tests</b> {{are being}} added to large panel studies with {{increasing}} regularity, such as the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). To facilitate the inclusion and interpretation of these tests, we provide some general background on personality psychology, personality assessment, and the validity of <b>personality</b> <b>tests.</b> In this review, we provide background on definitions of personality, {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the self-report approaches to <b>personality</b> <b>testing</b> typically used in large panel studies, and the validity of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> for three outcomes: genetics, income, and health. We conclude with recommendations on how to improve personality assessment in future panel studies. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{published an article}} in which we highlighted {{a number of issues}} {{associated with the use of}} self-report <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> in personnel selection contexts (Morgeson et al., 2007). Both Ones, Dilchert, Viswes-varan, and Judge (2007) and Tett and Christiansen (2007) have written responses to this article. In our response to these articles we address many of the issues raised by Ones et al. and Tett and Christiansen. In ad-dition to a detailed response, we make the following 4 key points: (1) Our criticisms of <b>personality</b> <b>testing</b> apply only to the selection context, not to all research on personality; (2) the observed validities of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> predicting job performance criteria are low and have not changed much over time; (3) when evaluating the usefulness of using <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> to select applicants, one must not ignore the observed, uncorrected validity; and (4) when discussing the value of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> for se-lection contexts, the most important criteria are those that reflect job performance. Implications for <b>personality</b> <b>testing</b> research and practice are discussed. We {{recently published}} an article in Personnel Psychology in which we highlighted a number of issues associated with the use of self-report <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> in personnel selection contexts (Morgeson et al., 2007). This article grew out of a panel discussion conducted at the 2004 Society Correspondence and requests for reprints should be addressed to Frederick P. Morgeson...|$|R
5000|$|The {{problem with}} <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> is ... that the {{validity}} of personality measures as predictors of job performance is often disappointingly low.

25|$|Two {{questionnaires}} were devised by Cloninger {{to measure the}} temperaments and characters of individuals. RD can be measured using both the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) <b>personality</b> <b>test</b> and by the newer and refined version of the <b>personality</b> <b>test</b> called Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and its revised version (TCI-R). Owing to the limitations encountered in the TPQ, in that the three dimensions’ clinical utility was not readily apparent to many clinicians, Cloninger revamped the questionnaire and produced the TCI scale, which incorporates four dimensions of “temperament” and three dimensions of “character”.|$|E
25|$|The <b>personality</b> <b>test</b> {{has been}} {{condemned}} by the psychologist Rudy Myrvang. He called the test a recruitment tool, aimed at breaking down a person {{so that the}} Scientologists can build the test-taker back up.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{methods to}} prevent {{socially}} desirable responding on behavior inventories. Some researchers believe {{it is necessary to}} warn test-takers not to fake good before taking a <b>personality</b> <b>test</b> (e.g., McFarland, 2003). Some inventories use validity scales {{in order to determine the}} likelihood or consistency of the responses across all items.|$|E
40|$|As organisations {{strive to}} {{maintain}} competitiveness and survive in an ever changing and dynamic market environment, our human capital (people) {{have never been}} of such importance to organisational success. Through selecting, recruiting, training and harnessing the right talent, competitive advantage may be achieved. Recruitment and selection is indeed an expensive, time consuming and sometimes unproductive task to undertake. It is a necessary yet often unyielding process if not approached in the correct manner and with the appropriate tools. In an attempt to identify {{the most effective and}} appropriate selection technique a study was undertaken into the effectiveness of <b>personality</b> <b>testing.</b> The reliability and validity of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> as a means of recruitment and selection were reviewed during this research study. In depth research into organisations that utilise <b>personality</b> <b>testing</b> were conducted and their opinions and results of <b>personality</b> <b>testing</b> as an effective selection tool were reviewed.

The organisations recruitment and selections procedure were monitored and compared to those organisations that utilise <b>personality</b> <b>testing...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{controversy}} in human resource practice and law today continues, to wit: –the use of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> in employment, typically online tests, which human resource practitioners are increasingly using in the hiring process, especially for executives, sales, {{and customer service}} positions. Selecting the right people for the right positions is, of course, one {{of the elements of}} success for any business. Accordingly, it is imperative for the employer to choose highly qualified people for open positions. This article examines the effectiveness, legality, fairness, and morality of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> in employment. Legal aspects of the use of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> are examined, principally pursuant to the U. S. Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. An ethical analysis of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> is provided to determine if their use in the context of employment is moral. The legal focus of the article is primarily on the private sector, but the principles are applicable across the board. The implications of the use of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> in employment are raised; and accordingly several recommendations are supplied to achieve a legal, moral, and practical use of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> in employment...|$|R
40|$|In this {{theoretical}} study objective <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> {{are presented}} as a possible means of assessing behavior in standardized settings. A new generation of objective <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> that are directly linked {{to the use of}} computers is described. One of the prime characteristics of these tests is {{that they do not have}} any face validity and are therefore less susceptible to the faking or other answer distortions that are regularly found in the subjective assessment of personality by means of questionnaires. Recent developments in the area of objective <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> are presented. The Hyperkinetic Syndrome Assessment Method (HKSD) is described as an example of the new generation of objective <b>personality</b> <b>tests.</b> The construction rationale, psychometric properties, and results on its validity are presented. Results from studies with clinical and non-clinical samples demonstrate the usefulness of the HKSD in practice. Objective <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> are discussed as alternatives in the field of psychological assessment and as valid, economical instruments for the assessment of behavior...|$|R
25|$|In 1947, a {{psychologist}} named Ross Stagner asked {{a number of}} personnel managers to take a <b>personality</b> <b>test.</b> After they had taken the test, Stagner, instead of responding with feedback based on their actual individual answers, presented each of them with generalized feedback that had no relation to their test answers but that was, instead, based on horoscopes, graphological analyses, and the like. Each of the managers was then asked how accurate the assessment of him or her was. More than half described the assessment as accurate, and almost none described it as wrong.|$|E
25|$|A {{generalization}} of Student's t statistic, called Hotelling's t-squared statistic, {{allows for the}} testing of hypotheses on multiple (often correlated) measures within the same sample. For instance, a researcher might submit a number of subjects to a <b>personality</b> <b>test</b> consisting of multiple personality scales (e.g. the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory). Because measures of this type are usually positively correlated, it is not advisable to conduct separate univariate t-tests to test hypotheses, as these would neglect the covariance among measures and inflate the chance of falsely rejecting at least one hypothesis (Type I error). In this case a single multivariate test is preferable for hypothesis testing. Fisher's Method for combining multiple tests with alpha reduced for positive correlation among tests is one. Another is Hotelling's T2 statistic follows a T2 distribution. However, in practice the distribution is rarely used, since tabulated values for T2 are hard to find. Usually, T2 is converted instead to an F statistic.|$|E
25|$|As the Sydney live metal scene {{began to}} recover {{with some new}} venues {{replacing}} those lost the year before, Rebel Razor ceased publication after the 24th issue in June 1996. Shortly afterward, Pacific Publications announced that HM was also being shut down. Several HM staff members including editor Jeremy Sheaffe then {{set up their own}} publishing house and produced the first issue of Loudmouth magazine in April 1997. By this time, nu metal had begun to have a strong influence over the domestic metal scene, with several of the more established metal acts taking aspects of that sound into their own, or shifting toward it completely. Superheist, a Melbourne group that had formed {{in the early part of}} the decade as a grindcore band, had re-invented themselves as a pop-laced nu metal act and before long was one of Shock's major bands with their songs being played on TV shows and added to mainstream compilation albums. Segression had begun to head in the same direction with their second album Fifth of the Fifth and by the time of their third release were well established as a nu metal band. Canberra band Henry's Anger had started out playing a dark alternative metal style similar to Tool but by 1997 they too were exploring a nu metal sound and by 1999 they were on the verge of a major breakthrough when their second album <b>Personality</b> <b>Test</b> was nominated for an ARIA Award in the Best Album Category. Another group was a Messiah from the Gold Coast. Formed in 1997 and with an 11-year-old drummer, the band created such a positive vibe that before long they had been signed to Sony and become Sunk Loto, a group who would have a serious mid-level career in the first part of the next decade.|$|E

In April 2008, Aftenposten noted that the French police were investigating connections between Scientology and Ballo's death. The investigation was being headed by a judge in France. In April 2008 the French police interviewed two leaders of Scientology in France. Prosecutor Eric de Montgolfier opened an investigation into the incident in France, in April 2008. A French investigating prosecutor told Dagbladet, [...] "We are almost convinced that it is a suicide. But the question is whether something encouraged her to this."

50|$|Employers {{may also}} view <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> as more {{accurate}} {{assessment of a}} candidate's behavioral characteristics versus an employment reference. But the problem with using <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> as a hiring tool is the notion a person's job performance in one environment will carry over to another work environment. However, {{the reality is that}} one's environment plays a crucial role in determining job performance, and not all environments are created equally. One danger of using <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> is the results may be skewed based on a person's mood so good candidates may potentially be screened out because of unfavorable responses that reflect that mood.|$|R

40|$|Although long {{thought to}} be {{unrelated}} to job performance, research in the early 1990 s provided evidence that personality can predict job perfor-mance. Accompanying this research was a resurgence {{of interest in the}} use of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> in high-stakes selection environments. Yet there are numerous potential problems associated with the current operational use of personality. As such, 5 former journal editors from Personnel Psy-chology and the Journal of Applied Psychology (2 primary outlets for such research), who have collectively reviewed over 7, 000 manuscripts and who have no vested interest in <b>personality</b> <b>testing,</b> reconsider the research on the use of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> in environments where impor-tant selection decisions are made. Their comments are based on a panel discussion held at the 2004 SIOP conference. Collectively, they come to several conclusions. First, faking on self-report <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> cannot be avoided and perhaps is not the issue; the issue is the very low valid-ity of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> for predicting job performance. Second, as such, using published self-report <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> in selection contexts should be reconsidered. Third, personality constructs may have value for em-ployee selection, but future research should focus on finding alternatives to self-report personality measures.
