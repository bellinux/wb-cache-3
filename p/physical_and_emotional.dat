5|$|Aesthetics as {{a factor}} of well-being. From the early austere {{principle}} that form should strictly follow function, {{there is a growing}} sensibility that aesthetics affect the <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> health of those who use a building or structure. Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and fresh air, and it may also be that harsh climatic conditions create an added imperative for uplifting aesthetics.|$|E

Further storylines include Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) relocating to a different hospital, and a group of new interns being intimidated by Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo).|$|E
5|$|Manning's {{books have}} {{received}} limited critical attention; as during her life, opinions are divided, particularly about her characterisation and portrayal of other cultures. Her works tend to minimise issues of gender, {{and are not}} easily classified as feminist literature. Nevertheless, recent scholarship has highlighted Manning's importance as a woman writer of war fiction and of the British Empire in decline. Her works are critical of war, racism, colonialism and imperialism, and examine themes of displacement and <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> alienation.|$|E
5|$|Portrait Diptych of Dürer's Parents (or Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the {{collective}} name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer. They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and Albrecht Dürer the Elder (c. 1427–1502), {{when she was}} around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of the <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> effects of ageing. The Dürer family was close and Dürer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter.|$|E

5|$|Though Tucker and Maria {{were warned}} against her having more {{children}} in her vulnerable <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> state, she again conceived, and died in pregnancy in February 1823. In the carriage to Washington after the funeral, Tucker muffled {{his face with a}} handkerchief to hide his tears and feigned a toothache in response to inquirers. Maria's death indeed weighed heavily upon him, as he reflected on his plausible neglect in the midst of her travails. He also was much concerned for his son Daniel's indolence and unbalanced behavior which years later would result in the son's hospitalization and ultimate death in 1838 in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Eric and Leslie Ludy {{met when}} Eric was 21 and Leslie was 16. They pursued a {{friendship}} {{for several months}} before starting to court, and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes Your Love Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but {{to wait for the}} life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes of sexual activity. Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool {{in the creation of the}} reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are supposed to look like.|$|E
5|$|Mengele used Auschwitz as an {{opportunity}} to continue his anthropological studies and research on heredity, using inmates for human experimentation. The experiments had no regard for the health, safety, or <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> suffering of the victims. He was particularly interested in identical twins, people with heterochromia iridum (eyes of two different colours), dwarfs, and people with physical abnormalities. A grant was provided by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, applied for by von Verschuer, who received regular reports and shipments of specimens from Mengele. The grant was used to build a pathology laboratory attached to Crematorium II at Auschwitz II-Birkenau. Dr. Miklós Nyiszli, a Hungarian Jewish pathologist who arrived in Auschwitz on 29 May 1944, performed dissections and prepared specimens for shipment in this laboratory. Mengele's twin research was in part intended to prove the supremacy of heredity over environment and thus bolster the Nazi premise of the superiority of the Aryan race. Nyiszli and others report that the twins studies may also have been motivated by a desire to improve the reproduction rate of the German race by improving the chances of racially desirable people having twins.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDually {{enrolled}} Medicare-Medicaid {{older adults}} are a vulnerable population. We tested House's Conceptual Framework for Understanding Social Inequalities in Health and Aging in Medicare-Medicaid enrollees {{by examining the}} extent to which disparities indicators, which included race, age, gender, neighborhood poverty, education, income, exercise (e. g., walking), <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> activity (e. g., housework) influence <b>physical</b> function <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> well-being. This secondary analysis included 337 Black (31 %) and White (69 %) older Medicare-Medicaid enrollees. Using path analysis, we determined that race, neighborhood poverty, education, and income did not influence physical function or emotional well-being.

This early injury interrupts the development of a robust sense of self and of others. Because <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> pain or neglect was often inflicted by attachment figures such as caregivers or older siblings, these individuals may develop a sense that they are fundamentally flawed and that others cannot be relied upon.|$|E
