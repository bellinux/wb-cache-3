5|$|Inspired by her new teacher, Blu Rain (Paula Patton), <b>Precious</b> finally {{learns to}} read and write. She meets {{sporadically}} with social worker Ms. Weiss (Mariah Carey), who learns about incest in the household when <b>Precious</b> reveals who fathered her children. While <b>Precious</b> is in the hospital giving birth to her second child, Abdul, she meets John McFadden (Lenny Kravitz), a nursing assistant who shows her kindness. Upon returning home, her mother carelessly drops 3-day-old Abdul and hits her, angrily declaring that Precious' revelation about the incest has resulted in their being cut off from welfare. <b>Precious</b> fights back and runs away from her home with Abdul. As they set out, she stops at a church window and watches the choir singing a Christmas hymn inside, imagining {{that she and her}} fantasy boyfriend are together and singing the song. <b>Precious</b> breaks into her school classroom seeking shelter. After Blu discovers her the next morning, she frantically calls local shelters looking for a safe place for <b>Precious</b> to stay. Later that night, <b>Precious</b> stays with Blu and her live-in girlfriend. The next morning, Blu takes her and Abdul to find assistance for them. She tells <b>Precious</b> that she will be able to continue her schooling while she raises Abdul in a halfway house.|$|E

5|$|At the Tehran Conference Winston Churchill {{made his}} famous remark that in wartime 'truth is so <b>precious</b> {{that she should}} always be {{attended}} by a bodyguard of lies.’ Clarke's principle was the opposite. His thesis was that the lie (the cover plan) was so <b>precious</b> {{that it should be}} flanked with an escort of truths.|$|E

5|$|While caddisflies in {{the wild}} {{construct}} their cases out of twigs, sand, aquatic plants, and rocks, the French artist Hubert Duprat makes art by providing wild caddisflies with <b>precious</b> stones and other materials. He collected caddisfly larvae from the wild {{and put them in}} climate-controlled tanks. He removes the larvae from their original cases and adds <b>precious</b> and semi-precious items such as grains of gold into the tank. The larvae then build new cases out of <b>precious</b> items, creating a unique form of artwork. The resulting works are sold across the world.|$|E

Both men and women would coil up their hair and many hair-coiling styles were developed.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} {{germanium}} has seen increasing use in <b>precious</b> metal alloys.

5|$|Mo'Nique as Mary Lee Johnston, Precious's {{verbally}} {{and physically}} abusive mother. Mo'Nique and Daniels had previously worked together in Shadowboxer (in which her character was named <b>Precious).</b>|$|E
5|$|Noting Daniels' {{admiration of}} the work of John Waters and Pedro Almodóvar and the joking {{attitude}} he and the actors sometimes took towards their material while making the movie, Jim Emerson argued that <b>Precious</b> is best understood as a deliberately over-the-top piece of camp in the vein of Waters's Female Trouble.|$|E
5|$|Nuskhuri, like Asomtavruli, is {{also often}} highly stylized. Writers readily formed {{ligatures}} and abbreviations for nomina sacra, including diacritics called karagma, which resemble titla. Because writing {{materials such as}} vellum were scarce and therefore <b>precious,</b> abbreviating was a practical measure widespread in manuscripts and hagiography by the 11th century.|$|E

From 1809 onwards, light metals, such as magnesium, aluminium, and titanium, were discovered, {{as well as}} less well-known heavy metals including gallium, thallium, and hafnium.|$|E
5|$|The listed items {{consist of}} {{materials}} such as wood over clay or to bronze. Often the articles were decorated {{using a variety of}} artistic techniques like gilding of <b>precious</b> metals, line engraving, maki-e, mother of pearl inlay or lacquer.

5|$|When Bi Sheng died, his fount of type {{passed into}} the {{possession}} of my followers (i.e. one of Shen's nephews), among whom it has been kept as a <b>precious</b> possession until now.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{has found}} many {{applications}} as catalyst in organic synthesis including asymmetric synthesis, being cheap and easily available alternative to <b>precious</b> metal complexes. The results (yield and ee) obtained with chiral zinc catalysts {{are comparable to}} those achieved with palladium, ruthenium, iridium and others, and zinc becomes metal catalyst of choice.|$|E
