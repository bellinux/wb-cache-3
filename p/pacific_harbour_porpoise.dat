40|$|The six {{species of}} {{porpoises}} inhabit the cold {{waters of the}} globe, displaying a textbook example of anti-tropical distribution in marine mammals. Nevertheless, the evolutionary history of the porpoises still remained poorly understood, but this knowledge is crucial to illuminate the conservation issues reported in these species (e. g. the nearly extinct vaquita, Yangzte finless porpoises; subspecies of harbour porpoises; poorly known spectacled and Burmeister porpoises). In this study, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of the porpoises in relation to past climatic changes. We used Next Generation Sequencing to assemble the mitochondrial genomes of 57 porpoises, resulting in a 16303 bps alignments. In contrast to previous beliefs, phylogenetic and population genetic analyses revealed that spectacled and Burmeister’s porpoises share a more recent common ancestor than with the vaquita. The vaquita would have split from the other during the Pliocene and then collapsed 3000 years ago. We also observed unreported subspecies level of divergence within the <b>Pacific</b> <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> similar to those reported in the North Atlantic, suggesting a richer evolutionary history than previously thought for this species.

The main aim of this thesis is to identify habitat preferences for <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise,</b> and key regions that embody these preferences, which could therefore be suitable as SACs; and to determine how <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> use these regions over time and space. Designed visual and acoustic line-transect surveys were conducted between 2003 and 2008. Generalised Estimating Equations (GEEs) were used to determine relationships between the relative density of <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> and temporally and spatially variable oceanographic covariates. Predictive models showed that depth, slope, distance to land and spring tidal range were all important in explaining porpoise distribution. There were also significant temporal variations in habitat use. However, whilst some variation was observed among years and months, consistent preferences for water depths between 50 and 150 m and highly sloped regions were observed across the temporal models. Predicted surfaces revealed a consistent inshore distribution for the species throughout {{the west coast of}} Scotland. Regional models revealed similar habitat preferences to the full-extent models, and indicated that the Small Isles and Sound of Jura were the most consistently important regions for <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise,</b> and that these regions could be suitable as SACs. The impacts of seal scarers on distribution and habitat use were also investigated, and there were indications that these devices have the potential to displace <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise.</b> These results should be considered in the assessment of sites for SAC designation, and in implementing appropriate conservation measures for <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> (Phocoena phocoena) {{is one of}} {{the common}} small {{cetaceans}} of European waters. This discreet and undemonstrative species is strongly represented throughout the cold waters of the northern hemisphere, and is the most abundant cetacean in the North Sea. In the last few years, some observations and studies indicate a shift of <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> distribution in European waters, from northern regions of the North Sea to the southern North Sea, English Channel and Celtic Sea. This shift may include a comeback around the coasts of France. <b>Harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> inhabit shelf-waters and are often observed in shallow waters, conditions offered for instance by the coasts of Brittany in north-western France. We used opportunistic sightings, aerial survey and a ten-year strandings database to study the presence of <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> along the coasts of Brittany. Opportunistic sightings made by non-specialists did not confirm a strong presence of <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> along the Brittany coasts, most probably because of the undemonstrative behaviour of this cetacean. However, aerial survey and stranding analysis indicate that <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> have become natural inhabitants of the Brittany coasts once more: 68. 6 % of cetacean school sightings made during a 1578 km aerial survey of the Brittany coasts concerned <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises,</b> with an encounter rate of 1. 5 individuals per 100 km that peaked to 5. 8 per 100 km {{to the top of the}} shallow waters of the south-western Western English Channel. The number of <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> strandings increased each year from 1997 to 2007, making a total of 135 along the coasts of Brittany. Other cetaceans did not show such an increase during the same period. Strandings of <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> were also characterized by an apparent increase as a proportion in relation to all the cetacean strandings during the months of September to January, by a marked impact of by-catch during winter, and by an almost total absence of stranded calves. The comeback of the <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> along Brittany coasts is clearly confirmed by our data, and a stable population seems to be established again along the coasts of Brittany. This tends to confirm the shift of the distribution of the species in certain European waters.

Although all cetaceans live in an aquatic environment, large differences exist between the behavioural ecologies of different species: corresponding variation in morphology and in dynamical swimming characteristics is expected between species. [...] Morphological variation was examined within a sample (n= 35) of <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> (Phocoena phocoena) to determine the values of several geometric parameters (including body volume, body surface area, volumetric coefficient, fineness ratio, fluke surface area, fluke aspect ratio and fluke sweep angle) for mature animals. <b>Harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> showed significant variation in several non-dimensional parameters with age, suggesting that other cetacean species may display similar variation. In general, juvenile <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> displayed lower fineness ratios and lower fluke aspect ratios than adult harbour porpoise: these results imply a lower propulsive efficiency for juvenile porpoise. [...] The morphologies of sexually mature <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> were statistically compared with a sample (n= 3) of Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus). <b>Harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> {{were found to have}} significantly lower fineness ratios than Atlantic white-sided dolphins, indicating a fatter body and a higher drag coefficient. <b>Harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> also displayed higher fluke aspect ratios. This suggests that the flukes of the <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> may have a higher propulsive efficiency than those of Atlantic white-sided dolphins, although the white-sided dolphins' high fluke sweep angles may compensate for their lower aspect ratio. [...] The morphologies of <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> and Atlantic white-sided dolphins were qualitatively compared with several other cetacean species. The largest between-species differences were observed for volumetric coefficient, fluke aspect ratio and the ratio of body surface area : fluke area. These morphological differences may reflect differences in relative swimming performance. [...] Dynamical swimming parameters, including swimming speed, fluke oscillation frequency, and stride length, were measured from videotape for a <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise,</b> an Atlantic white-sided dolphin and two long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas). Limited data on heave amplitude and maximum pitch angle of the flukes were also measured for the <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoise</b> and the white-sided dolphin.

Stride lengths were found to remain constant within species, and to vary significantly between species. The upstroke and downstroke of the flukes were found to be equally long for all speeds measured. [...] Finally, a statistical method to test the hypothesis of wave energy absorption by whales was developed, and the method was applied to the track of a long-finned pilot whale when corresponding wave conditions were known.

Bite mark characteristics were assessed in a retrospective analysis of photographs of dead <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> that stranded between 2003 and 2013 (n = 1081) on the Dutch coastline. There were 271 animals that were sufficiently fresh to allow macroscopic assessment of grey seal-associated wounds with certainty. In 25 % of these, bite and claw marks were identified that {{were consistent with the}} marks found on animals that had tested positive for grey seal DNA. Affected animals were mostly healthy juveniles that had a thick blubber layer and had recently fed. We conclude {{that the majority of the}} mutilated <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> were victims of grey seal attacks and that predation by this species is one of the main causes of death in <b>harbour</b> <b>porpoises</b> in The Netherlands. We provide a decision tree that will help in the identification of future cases of grey seal predation on porpoises...|$|R
