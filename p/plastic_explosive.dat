5|$|About 20 {{minutes before}} the plane landed, on its final descent, he {{secretly}} ignited a small explosive device consisting of a mix of <b>plastic</b> <b>explosive</b> powder and acid. Abdulmutallab apparently had a packet of the <b>plastic</b> <b>explosive</b> sewn to his underwear, and injected liquid acid from a syringe into the packet to cause a chemical reaction. While {{there was a small}} explosion and fire, the device failed to detonate properly. Passengers heard popping noises resembling firecrackers, smelled an odor, and saw the suspect's pants, leg and the wall of the plane on fire.|$|E
5|$|The RIRA {{initially}} took {{small amounts}} of materiel from Provisional IRA arms dumps {{under the control of}} McKevitt and other former Provisional IRA members, including the <b>plastic</b> <b>explosive</b> Semtex, Uzi submachine guns, AK-47 and AK-74 assault rifles, handguns, shotguns, detonators, and timing devices. The defection of senior Provisional IRA members also gave the RIRA the ability to manufacture home-made explosives and improvised mortars, including the Mark 15 mortar capable of firing a 200lb shell.|$|E
5|$|The first {{policeman}} {{to arrive}} on the scene noticed wires running from the van's dashboard through a hole into the back and {{reported that he had}} found the bomb. Forensic experts later estimated that the bomb weighed 1,500–1,600 kg (3,300–3,500 lb) and was a mixture of semtex, a military-grade <b>plastic</b> <b>explosive,</b> and ammonium nitrate fertiliser, a cheap and easily obtainable explosive used extensively by the IRA. Components of what may have been a tremble trigger were also found later, designed to detonate the bomb if it was tampered with.|$|E

50|$|Semtex {{was very}} similar to other <b>plastic</b> <b>explosives,</b> {{especially}} C-4, in being highly malleable; but it is usable over a greater temperature range than other <b>plastic</b> <b>explosives,</b> since it stays plastic between −40 and +60 °C. It is also waterproof. There are visual differences between Semtex and other <b>plastic</b> <b>explosives,</b> too: while C-4 is off-white in colour, Semtex is red or brick-orange.|$|R
50|$|The Convention on the Marking of <b>Plastic</b> <b>Explosives</b> for the Purpose of Detection is a {{multilateral}} anti-terrorism treaty {{that aims to}} prohibit and prevent the manufacture or storage of unmarked <b>plastic</b> <b>explosives.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} investigations at the site, which was cordoned off {{soon after the}} incident and screened by the investigating agencies, improvised explosive device (IED) was recovered from a metal dustbin, though no residue of the explosives, remains of any circuit or detonator were found, the device did not have shrapnel in it, thus there were no burn or shrapnel injuries, and all the injured were hit by pieces of wall that broke following the explosion, all suggesting the use of plastique explosive, PETN, TNT or C4. Early results revealed used of Semtex, a general-purpose <b>plastic</b> <b>explosive</b> containing RDX and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN); however, the final report of the Forensic Science Institute, Gujarat is awaited.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the damage}} to {{adjacent}} container AVN7511 to guide them, the investigators concluded that the explosion had occurred about 13inches (330mm) {{from the floor of}} AVE4041 and about 25inches (640mm) from the skin of the fuselage. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) investigators then conducted a series of tests in the United States, at which Alan Feraday of Britain's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) is understood to have been present. The tests involved using metal containers loaded with luggage, and detonating <b>plastic</b> <b>explosive</b> within Toshiba radio cassette players in garment-filled suitcases, so as to replicate the sooting and pitting pattern of AVE4041. The tests were said to have proved AAIB investigators' theory concerning both the position of the bomb and the quantity of explosive involved.|$|E
25|$|Boeselager was {{dispatched}} by Tresckow to urge his old commander, Kluge, {{to change}} his strategy and to join the conspiracy against Hitler. Kluge was now Commander-in-Chief in the West. Tresckow wanted Kluge to open the front in the West, begin negotiations for peace with the British and the Americans, and transfer units to the Eastern Front to fight the Soviets. Hitler and his national socialists would be eliminated. As Tresckow envisioned it, Kluge would arrange for the former's transfer {{so that he could}} help consolidate the coup. However, Kluge declined to participate in the plot or any planning. Boeselager continued to work with Tresckow and helped Wessel von Freytag-Loringhoven in procuring the British Hexogen <b>plastic</b> <b>explosive</b> and other parts used in the bomb meant to kill Hitler (a fact that his friends who were tortured by Hitler's security services never revealed).|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1980s, the Provisional IRA {{received}} {{large quantities}} of modern weaponry, including heavy weaponry such as heavy machine guns, over 1,000 rifles, several hundred handguns, rocket-propelled grenades, flamethrowers, surface-to-air missiles and the <b>plastic</b> <b>explosive</b> Semtex, from the Libyan regime of Muammar Gaddafi. There were four successful shipments between 1985 and 1986; three of these trips were {{carried out by the}} trawler Casamara and a fourth by the oil-rig replenisher Villa. All told, they brought in 110 tons of weaponry. A fifth arms cargo on board the coaster Eksund was intercepted by the French Navy in 1987. This brought the Provisional IRA's new capability {{to the attention of the}} authorities on either side of the Irish border. Five men were captured with the boat; three IRA members, including Gabriel Cleary, received jail sentences. Reportedly, Gaddafi donated enough weapons to arm the equivalent of two infantry battalions.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{recommendation}} {{that the site}} should be destroyed, the Royal Engineers stacked ten tons of British [...] bombs and captured German <b>plastic</b> <b>explosive</b> in the tunnels at Mimoyecques and detonated them on 9 May. This failed to achieve the desired effect, and on 14 May, a further 25 tons of explosives were used {{to bring down the}} north and south entrances to the railway tunnel into the site. A subsequent investigation by the British Bombing Research Mission concluded that the entrances had been heavily blocked {{and that it would be}} a very difficult and lengthy engineering task to reinstate them. The British action was taken without informing the French beforehand and infuriated Charles de Gaulle, who considered it a violation of France's national sovereignty.|$|E
500|$|A similar {{conclusion}} {{was the result}} of the capture of a steel hull trawler 15 July 1967 after three days of tracking by patrol aircraft and the radar picket, [...] After playing a cat-and-mouse game for three days with TF115 units the trawler headed for the mouth of the Sa Ky River on the Batangan Peninsula late on 14 July. The trawler was directed by Point Orient to heave to, but the hail was answered with gunfire. The cutter returned fire along with Wilhoite and gunboat , destroyer , and PCF-79. At 02:00 on 15 July, the trawler was boxed in and ablaze, and ran aground [...] from shore. South Korean marines directed artillery fire from the shore and at 06:00 with the trawler apparently abandoned, a U.S. Navy demolitions expert from Walker boarded the trawler and defused 2,000 pounds of TNT charges that were designed to scuttle the craft. Found on board were several thousand rounds of rifle and machine gun ammunition, mortar and rocket rounds, anti-personnel mines, grenades, and several thousand pounds of C-4 <b>plastic</b> <b>explosive</b> and TNT. Weapons found included several hundred machine guns, AK-47 rifles, AK-56 rifles, and B-40 rocket launchers.|$|E

500|$|The {{first flight}} {{took off in}} March 1964 from Tel Nof Airbase. The first weapons drop, {{witnessed}} on the ground by British mercenary Lieutenant Colonel Johnny Cooper, provided the royalists with a morale-boosting 180 old rifles, 34,000 rounds of Mauser and 17,000 rounds of [...]303 rifle ammunition, 72 six-pounder antitank shells and 150 pounds of <b>plastic</b> <b>explosive.</b> According to Hart-Davis, the Israelis had systematically concealed {{the source of the}} weapons delivered by the mercenaries, brazing out all the serial numbers, using Italian parachutes, and even ensuring that the packaging consisted of wood-shavings from Cyprus. The contracted aircraft flew along the Saudi coastline. The Saudis did not have radar systems, and would later state they were not aware of the airlifts. The planes would make the drops and then refuel in French Somaliland (now Djibouti) and return to bases in Israel. During the sixth flight, Boyle suggested that the IAF aircraft would also be used to bomb San'a. Weizman supported the idea and plans were made, but the Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff (Ramatkal) Yitzhak Rabin and Israeli Prime Minister, Levi Eshkol, denied him. The Porcupine operation went on over a period of slightly more than two years, during which the Stratofreighter carried out 14 nighttime sorties from Tel Nof to Yemen.|$|E
500|$|A large Real IRA {{explosives}} dump {{and arms}} cache {{were discovered in}} Dunleer, County Louth by Gardaí in October 2010, following a weekend of searches and arrests in {{the east of the}} country. In addition, two Real IRA men were charged in Dublin's non-jury Special Criminal Court of membership of an illegal organisation. The Real IRA claimed responsibility for kidnapping and shooting dead of one of their members, Kieran Doherty, for alleged drug dealing. Further significant seizures of Real IRA arms and explosives were made by the Gardaí during 2012 and 2013, leading to the arrest of over a dozen persons. In 2011 Michael Campbell, brother of Liam, was found guilty in Vilnius, Lithuania, of trying to purchase arms and explosives and was sentenced to twelve years in prison. In October 2013 Campbell was freed on appeal, only to have the Supreme Court of Lithuania order a retrial in June 2014. Campbell has maintained his innocence, accusing British intelligence of attempting to frame him. In June 2013 Gardaí arrested eight people after a Real IRA meeting and uncovered a massive haul of the <b>plastic</b> <b>explosive</b> Semtex in two raids in Dublin. In October 2013 the Real IRA claimed responsibility for [...] "executing" [...] an alleged leading cocaine dealer in north Belfast.|$|E
500|$|The 1947 nuclear {{stockpile}} {{consisted of}} nuclear weapons components, not weapons. Meeting with Truman in April 1947, Lilienthal informed him that not only were there no assembled weapons, but {{there were only a}} few sets of components, and no fully trained bomb assembly teams. By August 1946, Sandia Base held electrical and mechanical assemblies for about 50 Fat Man bombs, but there were only nine fissile cores in storage. The stockpile of cores grew to 13 in 1947, and 53 in 1948. Oppenheimer noted that the bombs were [...] "still largely the haywire contraptions that were slapped together in 1945." [...] With a half-life of only 140 days, the polonium-beryllium modulated neutron initiators had to be periodically removed from the plutonium pits, tested, and, if necessary, replaced. The cores had to be stored separately from the high explosive blocks that would surround them in the bomb because they generated enough heat to melt the <b>plastic</b> <b>explosive</b> over time. The heat could also affect the cores themselves, provoking a phase transition to a different allotrope of plutonium. They had to be periodically inspected by technicians wearing gloves and respirators. The bomb's electrical power for its radar fuzes and detonators came from a pair of lead-acid batteries similar to those used in cars. These had to be charged 24 hours before use. After a few days, the bomb had to be partially disassembled so that they could be re-charged; and three days after that the batteries had to be replaced.|$|E
