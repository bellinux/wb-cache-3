50|$|An {{electric}} {{command signal}} (flow rate set point) {{is applied to}} the integrated position controller which drives the pilot stage. The thereby deflected nozzle flapper system produces a pressure difference across the drive areas of the spool and affects its movement. The <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> (LVDT) which is excited via an oscillator measures the position of the spool (actual value, position voltage). This signal is then demodulated and fed back to the controller where it is compared with the command signal. The controller drives the pilot stage until the error between command signal and feedback signal will be zero. Thus the position of the spool is proportional to the electric command signal.|$|E

Of the 125 SJ trials, 69 trials (55. 2 %) were observed to have a SACM by the researchers. In the remaining 56 trials, 43 of these trials contained a force unload (= 10 % body mass) before initiation of the concentric action, indicating a SACM. Of the 119 SJ trials where a force unload was observed and detected by the force-time graph, 118 (99. 2 %) of these trials also showed a change in displacement using the displacement-time graph from the linear <b>position</b> <b>transducer.</b> The results of this study indicate that achieving compliance to protocol in the SJ is difficult, and that gross observation is inadequate in detecting a SACM in the SJ.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{determined}} the concurrent {{validity and reliability}} of force, velocity and power measurements provided by accelerometry, linear <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> and Samozino’s methods, during loaded squat jumps. 17 subjects performed squat jumps on 2 separate occasions in 7 loading conditions (0 – 60 % of the maximal concentric load). Force, velocity and power patterns were averaged over the push-off phase using accelerometry, linear <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> and a method based on key positions measurements during squat jump, and compared to force plate measurements. Concurrent validity analyses indicated very good agreement with the reference method (CV= 6. 4 – 14. 5 %). Force, velocity and power patterns comparison confirmed the agreement with slight differences for high-velocity movements. The validity of measurements was equivalent for all tested methods (r= 0. 87 – 0. 98). Bland-Altman plots showed a lower agreement for velocity and power compared to force. Mean force, velocity and power were reliable for all methods (ICC= 0. 84 – 0. 99), especially for Samozino’s method (CV= 2. 7 – 8. 6 %). Our findings showed that present methods are valid and reliable in different loading conditions and permit between-session comparisons and characterization of training-induced effects.

40|$|Tilting {{trains are}} {{provided}} with the ability of rotating their carbodies of several degrees {{with respect to the}} bogies about the longitudinal axis of the train. This permits a train to travel at a high speed while maintaining an acceptable passenger ride quality with respect to the lateral acceleration, and the consequent lateral force, received by the passengers when the train travels on a curved track at a speed in excess of the balance speed built into the curve geometry. When the carbody is tilted with respect to the bogie, the train pantograph needs to remain centered with respect to the overhead catenary, which is aligned with the track. The conventional solution is to mechanically link the pantograph to the bogie, but recent tilting trains have the pantograph connected to the carbody roof while a position servoloop continuously control the pantograph position such to keep it centered with the catenary. The merit of this design is to allow a gain of the useful volume inside the carbody. The pantograph position servoloop uses two position sensors providing a redundant position information to close the pantograph feedback loop and perform system monitoring. The monitoring functions presently implemented in pantograph position controls are able to detect the servocontrol failures, but in case of conflicting information from the two <b>position</b> <b>transducers</b> they are not always able to sort out which of the two transducer is failed because some failures of the <b>position</b> <b>transducers</b> cannot be detected by simply looking at the output signals of the transducer. As a result, if a difference between the output signals of the two <b>position</b> <b>transducers</b> is detected, the tilting function is disabled and the train speed is reduced. Also, the entire pantograph is then removed and replaced because the functionality of each individual transducer can only be checked at shop level. Developing better diagnostic techniques for the pantograph position control system have been encouraged by the train companies, but no work on this subject has so far been performed. A research activity was hence conducted by the Authors, that was aimed at developing an advanced diagnostic system that can both identify the presence of a failure and recognize which of the two <b>position</b> <b>transducers</b> is the failed one. In case of a transducer failure it is thus possible to isolate the failed transducer and keep the pantograph position control operational, thereby retaining the train tilting function. A further merit of the advanced diagnostic system is the reduction of maintenance time and costs because the failed transducer can be replaced without removing the entire pantograph from the train. The general architecture of this innovative diagnostic system, the associated algorithms, the mathematical models for the system simulation and validation, the simulation results and the possible future developments of this health management system are presented in the pape...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the validity of power measurement techniques during the jump squat (JS) utilizing various combinations of a force plate and linear <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> (LPT) devices. Nine men with at least 6 months of prior resistance training experience participated in this acute investigation. One repetition maximums (1 RM) in the squat were determined, followed by JS testing under 2 loading conditions (30 % of 1 RM [JS 30] and 90 % of 1 RM [JS 90]). Three different techniques were used simultaneously in data collection: (a) 1 linear <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> (1 -LPT); (b) 1 linear <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> and a force plate (1 -LPT + FP); and (c) 2 linear position transducers and a force place (2 -LPT + FP). Vertical velocity-, force-, and power-time curves were calculated for each lift using these methodologies and were compared. Peak force and peak power were overestimated by 1 -LPT in both JS 30 and JS 90 compared with 2 -LPT + FP and 1 -LPT + FP (p ≤ 0. 05). Peak power determined by 2 -LPT + FP was significantly higher than that determined by 1 -LPT + FP under the JS 90 loading condition. Peak vertical velocity determined by 2 -LPT + FP was significantly lower than that determined by either 1 -LPT and 1 -LPT + FP in JS 90. This investigation indicates that peak power and the timing of power output in the jump squat varies according to the measurement technique utilized. The 1 -LPT methodology is not a valid means of determining power output in the jump squat. Furthermore, the 1 -LPT + FP method may not accurately represent power output in free weight movements that involve a significant amount of horizontal motion...|$|E

During the first, 1 RM was assessed; during the second, load-velocity profiles were recorded with six loads (65 % to 90 % 1 RM) using a linear <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> recording at 1000 Hz; and during the third, minimal velocity thresholds (MVT) were recorded from the velocity of the last repetition during sets to volitional fatigue with 70 % and 80 % 1 RM with a linear <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> recording at 1000 Hz. Regression was then used to generate individualised load-velocity profiles and the MVT was used as a cut-off value from which to predict deadlift 1 RM. In general, velocity reliability was poor to moderate. More importantly, predicted deadlift 1 RMs were significantly and meaningfully less than actual deadlift 1 RMs (p < 0. 05, d = 1. 03 – 1. 75).
