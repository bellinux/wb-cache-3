25|$|<b>Process-oriented</b> {{psychology}}, {{also called}} process work, is a depth psychology theory and set of techniques developed by Arnold Mindell and associated with transpersonal psychology, somatic psychology and post-Jungian psychology. Process oriented psychology {{has been applied}} {{in a range of}} contexts including individual therapy and working with groups and organisations. It is known for extending dream analysis to body experiences and for applying psychology to world issues including socioeconomic disparities, diversity issues, social conflict and leadership.|$|E
25|$|With digital publishing, Fiztpatrick {{envisions a}} shift in the {{accepted}} conception of authorship from a solitary enterprise with a definite endpoint {{in the creation of the}} text to one of writing within a community as part of an ongoing process. This change is a result of the capabilities of word processing, which allows for the swift and simple revision of text, and the digital networking, which enables linking, reader commentary, and version control. By releasing text to be read and commented upon online authorship becomes ongoing, <b>process-oriented</b> work taking place in a community of interested readers.|$|E
25|$|Swiss {{psychiatrist}} Carl Jung, {{influenced by}} Freud, elaborated {{a theory of}} the collective unconscious—a primordial force present in all humans, featuring archetypes which exerted a profound influence on the mind. Jung's competing vision {{formed the basis for}} analytical psychology, which later led to the archetypal and <b>process-oriented</b> schools. Other well-known psychoanalytic scholars of the mid-20th century include Erik Erikson, Melanie Klein, D. W. Winnicott, Karen Horney, Erich Fromm, John Bowlby, and Sigmund Freud's daughter, Anna Freud. Throughout the 20th century, psychoanalysis evolved into diverse schools of thought which could be called Neo-Freudian. Among these schools are ego psychology, object relations, and interpersonal, Lacanian, and relational psychoanalysis.|$|E
25|$|By early 1995, the {{proposed}} CRA regulations were substantially revised to address criticisms that the regulations, and the agencies' implementation of {{them through the}} examination process to date, were too <b>process-oriented,</b> burdensome, and not sufficiently focused on actual results. The CRA examination process itself was reformed to incorporate the pending changes. Information about banking institutions' CRA ratings was made available via web page for public review as well. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) also moved to revise its regulation structure allowing lenders subject to the CRA to claim community development loan credits for loans made to help finance the environmental cleanup or redevelopment of industrial sites when {{it was part of}} an effort to revitalize the low- and moderate-income community where the site was located.|$|E
25|$|Behavioural change {{theories}} are attempts {{to explain why}} behaviours change. These theories cite environmental, personal, and behavioural characteristics as the major factors in behavioural determination. In recent years, there has been increased interest {{in the application of}} these theories in the areas of health, education, criminology, energy and international development with the hope that understanding behavioural change will improve the services offered in these areas. Some scholars have recently introduced a distinction between models of behavior and theories of change. Whereas models of behavior are more diagnostic and geared towards understanding the psychological factors that explain or predict a specific behavior, theories of change are more <b>process-oriented</b> and generally aimed at changing a given behavior. Thus, from this perspective, understanding and changing behavior are two separate but complementary lines of scientific investigation.|$|E

2500|$|Robert S. Cohen {{notes that}} the {{majority}} of English books on Buddhism use the term [...] "enlightenment" [...] to translate the term bodhi.

Cohen notes that bodhi is not the result of an illumination, but of a path of realization, or coming to understanding. The term [...] "enlightenment" [...] is event-oriented, whereas the term [...] "awakening" [...] is <b>process-oriented.</b> The western use of the term [...] "enlighten" [...] has Christian roots, as in Calvin's [...] "It is God alone who enlightens our minds to perceive his truths".|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, state {{media and}} some {{observers}} {{have pointed out}} that the CCDI has undergone significant structural reform in recent years aimed at making anti-corruption efforts more depoliticized, rules-based, and <b>process-oriented.</b> For much of its history the CCDI has been seen as a body that is largely inept at fighting corruption, but during the term of Hu Jintao the organization began a series of reforms strengthening its independence. Upon Xi's assuming the party leadership, further reforms were enacted to make the CCDI a bona fide control and auditing organization governed by a sophisticated set of rules and regulations to ensure professionalism and procedural fairness. [...] Under Xi, the CCDI became much less likely to face interference from local barons and vested interests in performing its duties. It has also strengthened internal regulations on the manner in which investigations are to be conducted, to ensure that CCDI officials themselves do not abuse their power and break the very same rules they are tasked with enforcing.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Spence {{wrote that}} [...] "Now comes a … powerful, wave of digital {{technology}} that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks. This process of labor substitution and disintermediation has been underway for some time in service sectors—think of ATMs, online banking, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, mobile payment systems, and much more. This revolution is spreading {{to the production of}} goods, where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor." [...] In his view, {{the vast majority of the}} cost of digital technologies comes at the start, in the design of hardware (e.g. 3D printers) and, more important, in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks. [...] "Once this is achieved, the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low (and declines as scale rises), and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero. With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing, the incentives to invest [...] are compelling." [...] Spence believes that, unlike prior digital technologies, which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world, the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies [...] "is cost reduction via the replacement of labor." [...] For example, as the cost of 3D printing technology declines, it is [...] "easy to imagine" [...] that production may become [...] "extremely" [...] local and customized. Moreover, production may occur in response to actual demand, not anticipated or forecast demand. Spence believes that labor, no matter how inexpensive, will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion, with labor-intensive, <b>process-oriented</b> manufacturing becoming less effective, and that re-localization will appear in both developed and developing countries. In his view, production will not disappear, but it will be less labor-intensive, and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion. Spence writes that [...] "the world we are entering is one in which the most powerful global flows will be ideas and digital capital, not goods, services, and traditional capital. Adapting to this will require shifts in mindsets, policies, investments (especially in human capital), and quite possibly models of employment and distribution." ...|$|E
