5|$|A {{natural setting}} for problem of Apollonius is inversive geometry. The basic {{strategy}} of inversive methods is to transform a given Apollonius problem into another Apollonius <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> simpler to solve; {{the solutions to}} the original problem are found from the solutions of the transformed problem by undoing the transformation. Candidate transformations must change one Apollonius problem into another; therefore, they must transform the given points, circles and lines to other points, circles and lines, and no other shapes. Circle inversion has this property and allows the center and radius of the inversion circle to be chosen judiciously. Other candidates include the Euclidean plane isometries; however, they do not simplify the problem, since they merely shift, rotate, and mirror the original problem.|$|E

The Indian government is implementing the world's largest child labour elimination program, with primary education targeted for ~250million. Numerous non-governmental and voluntary organisations are also involved. Special investigation cells {{have been set up}} in states to enforce existing laws banning employment of children (under 14) in hazardous industries. The allocation of the Government of India for the eradication of child labour was 10million in 1995–96 and 16million in 1996–97. The allocation for 2007 is 21million.|$|E

5|$|The usual {{magnetostrictive}} {{materials used}} for the transducer are either ferrite or compressed powdered iron. Mechanical filter designs often have the resonators coupled with steel or nickel-iron wires, but on some designs, especially older ones, nickel wire may be {{used for the}} input and output rods. This is because it is possible to wind the transducer coil directly on to a nickel coupling wire since nickel is slightly magnetostrictive. However, it is not strongly so and coupling to the electrical circuit is weak. This scheme also has the disadvantage of eddy currents, a <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> avoided if ferrites are used instead of nickel.|$|E

25|$|Child labour in India is {{a complex}} <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> rooted in poverty. Since the 1990s, the {{government}} has implemented a variety of programs to eliminate child labour. These have included setting up schools, launching free school lunch programs, creating special investigation cells, etc. Author Sonalde Desai stated that recent studies on child labour in India have found some pockets of industries in which children are employed, but overall, relatively few Indian children are employed. Child labour below the age of 10 is now rare. In the 10–14 age group, the latest surveys find only 2% of children working for wage, while another 9% work within their home or rural farms assisting their parents in times of high work demand such as sowing and harvesting of crops.|$|E
25|$|The <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{slowing down}} {{high-speed}} rail in Sweden is the present signaling system (ATC), {{which does not}} allow speeds over 200km/h. It can be upgraded, {{but it will not}} be done since it shall be replaced by the European signaling system ERTMS level 2 on major lines in the near future, allowing high speeds up to 250km/h. ERTMS level 2 has been installed and is being tried out on Botniabanan, and that railway allows 250km/h, although no passenger train goes above 200 for now. The train set X55-Regina has been delivered to the rail company SJ with the max speed of 200km/h but with the option to upgrade the EMU to 250km/h when possible. Also the mix with freight trains slow down the practical speed.|$|E

25|$|When using PCR in PGD, one {{is faced}} with a <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{inexistent}} in routine genetic analysis: the minute amounts of available genomic DNA. As PGD is performed on single cells, PCR has to be adapted and pushed to its physical limits, and use the minimum amount of template possible: which is one strand. This implies a long process of fine-tuning of the PCR conditions and a susceptibility to all the problems of conventional PCR, but several degrees intensified. The high number of needed PCR cycles and the limited amount of template makes single-cell PCR very sensitive to contamination. Another problem specific to single-cell PCR is the allele drop out (ADO) phenomenon. It consists of the random non-amplification {{of one of the}} alleles present in a heterozygous sample. ADO seriously compromises the reliability of PGD as a heterozygous embryo could be diagnosed as affected or unaffected depending on which allele would fail to amplify. This is particularly concerning in PGD for autosomal dominant disorders, where ADO of the affected allele could lead to the transfer of an affected embryo.|$|E
25|$|The {{traveling}} salesman {{problem is}} {{what is called a}} conventional optimization <b>problem.</b> <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> all the facts (distances between each destination point) needed to determine the optimal path to follow are known with certainty and the goal is to run through the possible travel choices {{to come up with the}} one with the lowest total distance. However, let's assume that instead of wanting to minimize the total distance traveled to visit each desired destination, we wanted to minimize the total time needed to reach each destination. This goes beyond conventional optimization since travel time is inherently uncertain (traffic jams, time of day, etc.). As a result, to determine our optimal path we would want to use simulation - optimization to first understand the range of potential times it could take to go from one point to another (represented by a probability distribution in this case rather than a specific distance) and then optimize our travel decisions to identify the best path to follow taking that uncertainty into account.|$|E

500|$|According to Chad Meister, {{professor}} of philosophy at Bethel College, most philosophers accept Plantinga's free will defense and thus see the logical problem of evil as having been sufficiently rebutted. Robert Adams says that [...] "it {{is fair to say}} that Plantinga has solved this <b>problem.</b> <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> he has argued convincingly for the consistency of God and evil." [...] William Alston has said that [...] "Plantinga [...] has established the possibility that God could not actualize a world containing free creatures that always do the right thing." [...] William L. Rowe has written [...] "granted incompatibilism, there is a fairly compelling argument for the view that the existence of evil is logically consistent with the existence of the theistic God", referring to Plantinga's argument.|$|E
500|$|Computing the {{interactions}} between the stars within a globular cluster requires solving what is termed the N-body <b>problem.</b> <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> each of the stars within the cluster continually interacts with the other N−1 stars, where N is {{the total number of}} stars in the cluster. The naive CPU computational [...] "cost" [...] for a dynamic simulation increases in proportion to N 2 (each of N objects must interact pairwise with each of the other N objects), so the potential computing requirements to accurately simulate such a cluster can be enormous. An efficient method of mathematically simulating the N-body dynamics of a globular cluster is done by subdividing into small volumes and velocity ranges, and using probabilities to describe the locations of the stars. The motions are then described by means of a formula called the Fokker–Planck equation. This can be solved by a simplified form of the equation, or by running Monte Carlo simulations and using random values. However the simulation becomes more difficult when the effects of binaries and the interaction with external gravitation forces (such as from the Milky Way galaxy) must also be included.|$|E
40|$|An {{object-oriented}} database model can support {{features such as}} abstract data types, methods, encapsulation, subtyping (or inheritance), complex structures, and object identity.
