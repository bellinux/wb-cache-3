Phosphorus solubilizing bacteria play role in phosphorus nutrition by enhancing its availability to plants through release from inorganic and organic soil P pools by solubilization and mineralization. Principal mechanism in soil for mineral phosphate solubilization is lowering of soil pH by microbial production of organic acids and mineralization of organic P by acid phosphatases. Use of phosphorus solubilizing bacteria as inoculants increases P uptake. These bacteria also increase prospects of using <b>phosphatic</b> <b>rocks</b> in crop production.

About 98 % of cropland in India is deficient in available forms of soil phosphorus and only 1 - 9 % has high phosphorus status. Intensive cropping pattern during this green and white revolution has also resulted in widespread deficiency of phosphorus. Although various amendments are available for management of P in different soil, all are costlier and practically difficult. Thus, even if the total soil P is high and also if P fertilizers are applied regularly, pH dependent chemical fixation determines the quantity of available P. The holistic P management involves a series of strategies involving manipulation of soil and rhizosphere processes, development of P efficient crops and improving P recycling efficiency. Microbial mediated P management is an ecofriedly and cost effective approach for sustainable development of agricultural crop.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the existing methods for extracting trace sulfate from francolite and measuring its concentration and sulfur isotope composition. <b>Phosphatic</b> <b>rocks</b> were chemically and thermally treated to remove non-structural SO 42 − in francolite, which would otherwise be inadvertently included in geochemical analyses of the structurally-bound sulfate. Acetic acid (10 % v/v) proved to be effective in removing calcite, dolomite and ankerite without affecting francolite. To remove all 'easily' soluble sulfates, such as Ca-sulfates and adsorbed sulfate, rinsing with 10 % v/v NaCl had to be repeated several times for most samples. For subsequent S isotope determination sample combustion at 600 °C was found to be an efficient way to remove non-francolite S-bearing phases. From a number of SO 42 − detection methods tested, ICP-AES proved to be the most accurate. For francolite-sulfate recovery, our recommended protocol involved repeated rinsing of powdered phosphorites with 10 % NaCl as well as NaOCl, and testing of the filtrate for SO 42 − in each wash. If only S isotope compositions are needed, combustion at 600 °C with a subsequent de-ionised water rinse could be undertaken instead of repeated NaOCl rinsing for studies of both francolite and carbonate.

40|$|Selenium (Se) is a {{naturally}} occurring metalloid element, which {{is essential to}} human and other animal health in trace amounts but is harmful in excess. Of all the elements, selenium {{has one of the}} narrowest ranges between dietary deficiency ( 40 gday 1) and toxic levels ( 400 gday 1) (WHO, 1996), which makes it necessary to carefully control intakes by humans and other animals, hence, the importance of understanding the relationships between environmental exposure and health. Geology exerts a fundamental control on the concentrations of selenium in the soils on which we grow the crops and animals that form the human food chain. The selenium status of populations, animals, and crops varies markedly around the world as a result of different geological conditions. Because diet is the most important source of selenium in humans, understanding the biogeochemical controls on the distribution and mobility of environmental selenium is key to the assessment of selenium-related health risks. High selenium concentrations are associated with some <b>phosphatic</b> <b>rocks,</b> organic-rich black shales, coals, and sulfide mineralization, whereas most other rock types contain very low concentrations and selenium-deficient environments are far more widespread than seleniferous ones. However, health outcomes are not only dependent on the total selenium content of rocks and soils but also on the amount of selenium taken up into plants and animals—the bioavailable selenium. This chapter demonstrates that even soils containing adequate total amounts of selenium can still produce selenium-deficient crops if the selenium is not in a form ready for plant uptake...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} stream sediment {{and gravity}} surveys carried {{out across the}} Berwyn Dome and adjacent areas. The gravity survey confirmed {{the presence of a}} broad regional Bouguer anomaly low in {{the central part of the}} Dome, on which is superimposed several smaller irregular highs and lows. Some of these local anomalies possibly reflect small igneous bodies but more detailed gravity surveys would be needed to determine their form. Near Corwen the Bryneglwys Fault coincides with a 4. 5 mGa 1 anomaly but southwards the two features diverge, suggesting that the density interface is related either to a splay fault or to the eastern margin of the Lower Palaeozoic Montgomery trough. Some other structural trends are weakly reflected on the Bouguer anomaly and aeromagnetic maps, but there is no clear correlation with known base metal mineralisation. The Bouguer anomalies cannot be attributed to particular structures with any certainty but are probably due to a number of factors, including variation in the Precambrian basement and changes in the lithology and thickness of Lower Palaeozoic sedimentary rocks. There is no evidence for a large granitic body in Lower Palaeozoic rocks underlying the mineralisation at Llangynog. The aeromagnetic map suggests the presence of a magnetic basement at a depth of 3 - 4 km centred beneath the northwestern margin of the Dome. The stream sediment survey involved the collection of a - 100 mesh stream sediment, panned concentrate and water sample from each of the 399 sites sampled. The sample density was 1 site per 1. 5 km*. Cu, Pb, Zn, Ba, Fe, Mn, Co, V, Cr, Ni, Zr, MO and Sn were determined in the stream sediments, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ba, Fe, Mn, Ce, Sn, Sb, Ti, Ni and As in the panned concentrates and Cu, Pb and Zn in stream waters. Major variations in the results are related to (i) hydrous oxide precipitation processes, (ii) contamination from human activities, (iii) base metal and baryte mineralisation, (iv) monazite concentrations in panned concentrates, (v) hitherto unrecorded gold mineralisation and (vi) lithological variations. The latter were related principally to shale-sandstone variation, but groups of elements attributable to the presence of basic intrusions, <b>phosphatic</b> <b>rocks,</b> coal measures, sandstones, limestones and volcanics were also discerned. Threshold levels were established from cumulative frequency curve analysis, and some anomalous sites were examined in the field. Anomalies did not form prominent coherent groups and were generally weak and scattered, with a wide variety of element groupings reflecting a range of causes. Many anomalous panned concentrates were examined mineralogically to try to. determine whether anomalies were related to chemically extreme background lithologies, contamination, or mineralisation. All the anomalies were related to one or more of the major causes of variation, although because of the very limited amount of follow-up work carried out the precise cause of many anomalies remains uncertain. No anomaly is considered to represent a strong prospect but several deserve further limited investigation, notably those associated with (i) gold mineralisation in the northwest of the area, (ii) baryte, perhaps accompanied by base metal ’ mineralisation, associated with Caradocian volcanics and <b>phosphatic</b> <b>rocks</b> at several localities, (iii) mineralisation associated with Llandeilian limestones and volcanic rocks north of Llanrhaeadr, and (iv) copper mineralisation associated with intrusives near the eastern margin of the Dome, where survey data is most incomplete...|$|E

It is intimately associated with feldspars that are the continental crust-dominant mineral species and suggest, by mass balance, {{that they are the}} host of 50 – 90 % of crustal P 2 O 5. The commonest and most extensive ores (87 %) are sedimentary and marine in origin (Van Kauwenbergh 2010). Phosphate rock (PR) is a globally accepted but imprecise term describing any naturally occurring geological material that contains one or more phosphate minerals suitable for commercial use. Five major types of phosphate sources in the world are as follows: marine phosphate deposits, igneous phosphate deposits, metamorphic deposits, biogenic deposits, and phosphate deposits as a result of weathering. Approximately 75 % of the world’s phosphate resources are from sedimentary, marine phosphate rock deposits, 15 – 20 % from igneous and weathered deposits, and only 1 – 2 % from biogenic resources and large bird and bat guano accumulations. Phosphate minerals in the primary environment include (1) fluorapatite (Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 F 2), in igneous and metamorphic environments, as in carbonatites and mica pyroxenites; (2) hydroxyapatite (Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 (OH) 2), in igneous and metamorphic environments and biogenic deposits, e.g., in bone deposits; (3) carbonate-hydroxy-apatites (Ca 10 (PO 4,CO 3) 6 (OH) 2), on islands and in caves, as part of birds and bat excrements, guano; (4) francolite (Ca 10 NaMg(PO 4) 6 (CO 3)F 2), carbonate-substituted apatite present in marine environments, and a much smaller extent in weathering environments for instance over carbonatites (Van Straaten 2002).|$|E

Additionally, trace-element concentrations in veg- etation samples collected from wetlands associated with mine waste-rock piles were compared with samples collected from a single reference wetland. In undisturbed areas, Se in vegetation growing in soils overlying and derived from Phosphoria Formation <b>phosphatic</b> <b>rocks</b> tended to be higher than vegetation in undisturbed Wells Limestone or Rex Chert soils. Vegetation growing in highly disturbed soils, such as those comprising waste-rock dumps, had the highest tissue Se. Vegetation in a wetland at the base of Wooley Valley Unit 4 waste-rock dump accumulated decreasing concentrations of Se with increasing distance away from the waste-rock dump along the wetland flow path. Iron oxides were observed coating wetland sediment surfaces and helped control Se bioavailability. Plant uptake, as well as coprecipitation and sorption of Se by iron oxides, were key processes in the natural attenuation of Se in this wetland. Legumes at the rock dumps contained higher Se (mean = 80 mg kg- 1) than trees (mean = 52 mgkg 1), grasses (mean = 18 mgkg 1), shrubs (mean = 6 mgkg 1), and forbs (mean = 3 mg kg- 1). However, grasses were among the highest Se accumulators among plant lifeforms in contaminated wetlands, with a mean value of 53 mg kg 1 Se. In most places, uptake of Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, and Zn was below critical high levels for plants. However, Se, Cd, Cr, and Zn uptake by some plants may have been large enough to affect their growth. Several plant lifeforms had Se concentrations that surpassed the acute and chronic toxicity thresholds for grazing livestock and wildlife, posing a lethal risk to these animals. Forages, particularly legumes, sampled from waste-rock dumps had increased Mo concentrations, resulting in Cu/Mo ratios below 1. High Mo (above 10 mg kg 1) and Cu/Mo ratios below 2 may cause molybdenosis in ruminants. There were instances where tree Zn content exceeded upper chronic intake for livestock/wildlife. This may pose some concern for browsing animals feeding upon trees, particularly in winter months. Based on the vegetation survey, possible remediation strategies via physical, chemical, and biologi- cal manipulations of the contaminated sites include removal of the most contaminated soils, capping contaminated soils and revegetating capping materials, application of selec- tive herbicides to remove legumes from reclaimed waste-rock dumps, and fencing some contaminated areas to better manage grazing...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} properties of zeolites and zeolite-like aluminophospate materials is their thermal behaviour (i. e., stability, phase transformations, rate, temperature and number of dehydration/ rehydration cycles) which is of crucial importance in the wide industrial applications of these materials (e. g. adsorbers, catalysts, molecular sieves). A number of factors contribute to the macroscopically observable thermal effects such as evolution of H 2 O and encapsulated organic species, variation in unit-cell volume and structural breakdown or modification [1, 2]. These effects, which modify the pore and channel geometry, affect the adsorption and diffusion of molecules in zeolites and microporous AlPO 4 frameworks, and consequently the adsorption, molecular sieving and catalytic properties of these materials. However, for many zeolite-type materials, detailed and accurate information on their response to heating is still missing and sometimes, even when available, controversial or unreliable. The present investigation strikes to give an exhaustive picture of the structural modifications upon removal of water in metavariscite (AlPO 4 · 2 H 2 O), by means of an in situ temperature-resolved powder diffraction study using synchrotron radiation. This Al-phosphate commonly occurs as a weathering product of <b>phosphatic</b> <b>rocks</b> as well as concretions due to phosphatization of kaolin during weathering. It bears a great importance for soil science, since its formation strongly reduces the effectiveness of phosphate fertilizers. The metavariscite structure consists of a three-dimensional framework in which the tetrahedral units link to one another by shared corner-oxygen atoms, and their formulae are designated as T(1) T(2) O 4, where T(1) represents the trivalent atom and T(2) is P. We have performed time-resolved dehydration experiments on metavariscite powders at the ID 22 beamline (ESRF, Grenoble), using a fixed X-ray wavelength of 0. 400031 (1) Å. X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded in the 0. 5 – 19. 5 2 θ range and the crystal structure evolution was continuously monitored through 30 Rietveld structure refinements from 30 ° to 800 °C. TG/DTA curves on a fraction of the same sample contained in an open alumina crucible were measured in air using a Netzsch STA 409 simultaneous TG/DTA thermoanalyser. Temperature range and heating rate were from room temperature (RT) to 900 °C and 10 °/min, respectively. The results of the above studies indicate that: (i) from room temperature to 150 °C metavariscite (monoclinic dimorph of AlPO 4 · 2 H 2 O) appears as the main phase, (ii) in the range of 170 °– 250 °C metavariscite starts to disappear giving rise to α-berlinite (trigonal form of AlPO 4) that is the stable phase up to about 610 °C, and (iii) above the latter temperature the structure adopts the more stable configuration of the tetragonal β-berlinite polymorph.

In the samples analyzed it is possible to observe that the 234 U/ 238 U activity ratio is approximately one.

A very good correlation exists between the activity concentrations found by alpha spectrometry and those found by gamma spectrometry. Continued application of phosphate fertilizers to soil over a period of many years could eventually increase the radium and uranium content of the soil, which would result in an increase of the dose to bone. In any case in order to estimate the environmental impact of fertilizers use, it is necessary to evaluate the transfer of radionuclides and their concentration distribution in the environmental matrices such as soil,vegetation, milk, etc. and the individual doses by using mathematical models...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Late Cretaceous Duwi Formation in Egypt overlies non-marine, varicolored shale of {{the middle}} Campanian Quseir Formation. It is {{conformably}} overlain by gray, laminated, foraminiferal-rich marine shale {{of the middle}} Maastrichtian Dakhla Formation. Detailed mineralogical and geochemical {{studies were carried out}} on the phosphate rocks of the Duwi Formation in Quseir-Safaga province (Geble Duwi Mine) to infer their source rocks, paleo-weathering and provenance of the sources. The importance of the effect of phosphate rock depends on the chemical form of phosphorus in which this element is combined. This information is important in the assessment of possible radiological hazards to human health; due to the presence of uranium in the apatite structure. The <b>phosphatic</b> <b>rock</b> materials may be used as building stones or as phosphatic fertilizers and animal feed ingredients. Mineralogically, they are composed mainly of apatite (fluor-apatite), calcite and quartz with minor amounts of pyrite. The studied Duwi phosphates are authigenic in origin, comparable to those of phosphatic nodules of Peru and Chile margins. They are most probably derived from pre-existing authigenic phosphorites. Provenance, they originate from reworked older sedimentary phosphorites and biogenic sources. The geochemical data, CIA values suggested that the Duwi Formation phosphates were subjected to low chemical weathering. Generally, the enrichment of the trace elements, REEs and uranium may have occurred during diagenesis. The studied phosphate samples were compared to the average of the Average World Phosphorite (AWP) and the Average Shale Composition (ASC). The major, trace and rare earth elements contents are compared with those in Egypt, North African, Asian and other localities. The ratios V/Cr, V/(V+Ni) and Mo/Al and the high concentrations of the redox sensitive elements revealed that the studied phosphates were deposited under anoxic reducing marine environments coupled with hydrothermal solutions, which is comparable to the environmental condition of the associated black shales. The concentration of the trace and toxic elements in the studied samples are considered to be below the limits for most field-grown crops...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the current situation of phosphorus, an element classified and considered as critical element by the European Union, at global, European and Spanish level. Its importance, although used in many industrial application it is associated to its ole as a nutrient in fertilizers production and use. It is estimated that the phosphate resources, in the form of <b>phosphatic</b> <b>rock,</b> are limited so it is considered a non-renewable source of phosphorus and its reserves are concentrated in a few deposits in a few number of countries. This has caused the entry of phosphorus into the designated critical elements in the EU and the necessity to apply the circular economy model for its use. In this way it is intended to close the cycle of phosphorus from secondary sources. The analysis carried out of the P cycles worldwide allow to conclude that recovery of phosphorus from a) the urban water cycle, specially from the sludge generated in the waste water treatment plants (WWTP), b) compost produced from the faeces (swine solids) from animal farms or, c) ashes originated from sludge incineration are the main secondary resources to be considered nowadays. However, it has been identified the need to promote tertiary sources by improving the efficiency of phosphorus processing and use in all sectors (mining and beneficiation, agriculture), also including restricting laws limiting the use of phosphorus for essential needs and changes feeding systems. In this project, a balance flow of phosphorus in Spain using the Substance Flow Analysis (SFA) methodology, allowed to the identification of the available secondary sources and compare with other ready-made for EU 27 and reference countries as Japan. Additionally to the SFA for Spain a proposal to promote and improve phosphorus cycling was centred in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area (BMA). WWTP from the BMA were as main secondary resource to promote the recovery of phosphorus from the WWTPs streams. This assessment required a detailed study of the Phosphorous balance in the BMA by using raw data provided by the WWTP management system of the BMA during the years 2011 - 2015. From the different streams evaluated sludge streams were considered key actors and specially the management routes and fates of sludge in these years. In 2011 most of the sludge was destined to cement industry, in a material co-substitution of coque, a fact that was declining until 2015 which were sent directly to composting plants due to the crisis in the construction sector with the reduction of cement production. This suggests the use of the sludge for the cement industry again, but the truth is that the objectives of EU on the circular economy approach for critical elements will cause that sewage sludge would not be use by the cement industry and then different sewage sludge options promoting the recovery of phosphorus will be needed. From these premises, four scenarios, postulating P-cycling options in the BMA by proposing the integration of different sludge management processes (anaerobic digestion, monoincineration, composting and recovery technology phosphorous, called Ecophos) were raised and evaluated in this project. Combining each other, a detailed analysis for energy balances, mass balances, phosphorus recovery, environmental and economic impact has been performed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Radioactive {{characteristics}} of pits drilled in the Al-Sharquieh mine while prospecting for recent phosphatic resources have been investigated. The {{results indicate that}} phosphatic layers are characterized generally by high radioactive intensities (more than 800 c. p. s). The lithological sec-tion {{in the study area}} is very complex sedimentologically, and characterized by high faciological variation in all directions. The Schlumberger geo-electrical configuration with fine separation of AB/ 2 was successfully applied to determine lithological boundaries, and the resistivities of the lay-ers of the lithological section, especially for thin layers. It was shown that the phosphatic layer resis-tivities increase or decrease as a function of associated material. As a result, two types of phosphatic layers have been geo-electrically distinguished. The first is characterized by high resistivity and rel-atively low radioactivity, which could be related to the <b>rock</b> <b>phosphatic</b> layers. The second is char-acterized by low resistivities and high radioactivity, which could be related to the sandy phosphatic layers. © 2001 Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2004 Triassic age rocks {{constitute}} an important sedimentary interval on the North Slope of Alaska, because they include organic-rich source rocks that generated {{much of the}} oil that accumulated in the Prudhoe Bay field. Three detailed measured sections {{in the northeast and}} north-central Brooks Range are characterized using sequence stratigraphy, chemostratigraphy, biostratigraphy and ichnofabric, allowing interpretations about the evolution of the depositional environment and general paleogeographic setting through the Middle and Upper Triassic. High resolution correlation provides insight into the timing and pattern of source rock accumulation in the Shublik and Otuk Formations. Sequence and chemo-stratigraphic analyses suggest that deposition took place on a broad, low-angle shelf under fluctuating paleoceanographic conditions. Recorded are three third order sequences, each containing a sea level rise and highstand. Glauconitic, <b>phosphatic,</b> and organic-rich <b>rocks</b> of the Shublik and Otuk Formations indicate deposition in an environment characterized by oceanic upwelling.

40|$|Scholarly {{attention}} has recently {{focused on the}} extent of the deterioration of the Great Barrier Reef and several authors have attempted to place that decline into historical context. We present documentary and oral history evidence that the extent and severity of mining in the Great Barrier Reef has been hitherto neglected in environmental histories of the ecosystem. Extraction of <b>phosphatic</b> sandstone, guano, <b>rock</b> phosphate and coral from many islands, cays and coral reefs have resulted in extensive transformations of some habitats. In particular, Raine, Lady Elliot, Lady Musgrave, North West and Holbourne Islands experienced intensive mining for guano and rock phosphate, while more sustained guano mining took place at Upolu, Oyster and Michaelmas Cays prior to 1940. Coral mining - which has not previously been documented for the Great Barrier Reef - also occurred in at least twelve locations between 1900 and 1940 with the result that thousands of tons of coral were removed from some reefs and pulverised to produce agricultural and industrial lime. This account suggests that historical mining in the Great Barrier Reef has left impacts in the landscape of several islands and cays. Further scientific research and monitoring is required to elucidate the impacts of coral mining, although comparisons with coral mining sites elsewhere in the world suggest that it is reasonable to presume that the impacts of that activity were severe for parts of several reefs, including Snapper Island, Kings and Alexandra Reefs...|$|R
30|$|Carbonates showed its {{presence}} in water at pH more than 8.3, and hence, in the present study, no carbonate (CO 3 -) alkalinity could be expected {{in any of the}} water sources (Narain and Chauhan 2000) as they had pH lower than 8.3. The total alkalinity therefore of the water sources could be considered almost entirely due to the presence of bicarbonates (Pawar 1993). Bicarbonate content (as CaCO 3) of the GW samples was observed in the range of 34 – 119  mg/L (mean 70  mg/L) in the wet seasons and 18 – 68  mg/L (mean 43  mg/L) in the dry seasons, respectively (Khound et al. 2012). Wet season HCO 3 − was found at slightly higher levels indicating some contribution from the carbonate weathering process due to heavy rainfall in the river basin. SW samples showed HCO 3 − values varied from 18 – 39  mg/L in the wet seasons and 28 – 54  mg/L in the dry seasons (Khound et al. 2012). However, all the water sources showed the bicarbonate alkalinity values within the WHO (1984) permissible limit (120  mg/L) for drinking water. In the present study, GW Cl− showed a wide range of values from 5.6 to 110.7  mg/L in the wet season with a mean value of 39.1  mg/L and from 8.8 to 90.7  mg/L with a mean value of 36.8  mg/L in the dry seasons (Khound et al. 2012). Similarly, SW Cl− content was found in the wide range of values from 5.9 to 25.3  mg/L with a mean value of 10.9  mg/L in the wet seasons and from 9.8 to 28.7  mg/L with a mean value of 15.5  mg/L in the dry seasons (Khound et al. 2012). 54 % of aquifers and 92 % of the SW sources presented higher Cl− values in the dry seasons than those of the wet seasons. The low chloride content of the water sources in both the seasons could be due to the (1) absence of industrial activities as well as low rate of percolation of agricultural and domestic wastes to the water bodies and (2) insignificant geogenic contributions from the area (Mariappan et al. 2000). However, all the water sources showed Cl− content below the permissible limit of 600  mg/L (WHO 2011) for drinking water and therefore the water was free from excessive presence of chloride in both the wet and dry season. The aquifers in the present study showed the SO 42 − content in a wide range from 7.1 to 83.1  mg/L with a mean value 21.4  mg/L in the wet seasons and 3.1 – 38.0  mg/L with a mean value 18.1  mg/L in the dry seasons (Khound et al. 2012). Similarly, SO 42 − contents of the SW sources were observed from 1.8 to 14.2  mg/L in the wet seasons and 3.4 – 28.4  mg/L in the dry seasons (Khound et al. 2012), respectively. The variation of SO 42 − concentration in both the seasons was thus very wide. 58 % of the dug wells and 85.8 % of the SW sources showed higher SO 42 − content in the wet season than in the dry season. However, all the water sources in both the wet and dry season were found to have sulfate contents much below the permissible limit (200  mg/L, WHO 2004) for drinking and other household purposes. The aquifers of the basin showed only small amounts of NO 3 − from BDL to 0.72  mg/L with a mean value of 0.11  mg/L in the wet seasons and BDL to 0.23  mg/L with a mean value of 0.04  mg/L in the dry seasons (Khound et al. 2012). 46 % of the GW samples possessed higher NO 3 − concentration in the dry season in compared to that of wet season. 38 % aquifers in the dry season and 18 % aquifers in the wet season showed NO 3 − concentration below the detection limit in the study area. The SW sources were also found to have only small amounts of NO 3 − from BDL to 1.23  mg/L in the wet and BDL to 0.43  mg/L in the dry seasons. 80 % of the SW samples showed higher NO 3 − concentration in the wet season, while the rest 20 % samples showed higher values in the dry season. 27 % SW sources in the dry season and 13 % sources in the wet season showed NO 3 − concentration below the detection limit in the study area. However, all the values were well below the WHO (2004) recommended value of 50  mg/L for drinking water in both the seasons. Smaller nitrate values of study area indicated that the nitrifying bacteria were not much active due to the presence of anaerobic conditions (the area having a water cover for most of the time) for the large part of the year. The presence of extensive paddy cultivation in the study area suggested that agricultural runoff was the probable source for this concentration (Kumar et al. 2011). High concentration of nitrate causes methemoglobinemia or blue baby syndrome and have been cited as a risk factor in developing gastric an intestinal cancer (Chapman 1996). However, the contents in the present work were very low to arouse such concern. GW PO 43 − values were recorded in the range from 0.01 to 1.27  mg/L with a mean value of 0.16  mg/L in the wet seasons and BDL to 0.98  mg/L with a mean value of 0.07  mg/L in the dry seasons (Khound et al. 2012). 82 % GW samples showed higher PO 43 − concentration in the wet season than the dry season. In dry season, 36 % of the aquifers showed PO 43 − content below the detection limit. The SW sources also showed similar PO 43 − content in the range from BDL to 1.48  mg/L in the wet seasons and from BDL to 1.14  mg/L in the dry seasons. In the wet seasons, 5.7 % and in the dry seasons, 37.2 % of the SW sources showed PO 43 − content below the detection limit, while 88.5 % SW samples possessed more PO 43 − concentration in the wet season than the dry season. PO 43 − enters SW through several routes including weathering of phosphate containing rocks, agricultural runoff carrying unused fertilizers and percolation of sewage and industrial wastes (Anda et al. 2001). The presence of vast paddy rice cultivation in the study area obviously pointed to agricultural runoff being the main source. The high PO 43 − concentration during the months of June and July, i.e., the monsoon period could be attributed to agricultural runoff and discharge of water containing detergents etc. from the surface (Kumar et al. 2011). In the present study, the fluoride concentration of the dug wells varied in the range of BDL– 0.49  mg/L (mean value: 0.06  mg/L) in the wet seasons and BDL– 0.70  mg/L (mean value: 0.08  mg/L) in the dry seasons (Khound et al. 2012), respectively. 36 % aquifer showed higher wet season F− than the dry season content. SW sources were also found to have F− content from BDL- 0.10  mg/L (mean value: 0.01  mg/L) in the wet seasons and BDL- 0.14  mg/L (mean value: 0.01  mg/L) in the dry seasons. In 22.9 % of the SW samples, the F− content was higher in the dry seasons, while in the wet seasons, most of the sources had fluoride below the detection limit mainly due to dilution. However, all the water samples had F− content well below the acceptable limit (1.5  mg/L) of WHO (1984) for drinking purposes in both the wet and dry season. The sources of F− ion in the studied water sources could be attributed to mineral and inorganic nutrients, agricultural and domestic sewage runoff (Rao et al. 2015). Fluoride enters SW sources mainly from weathering of <b>rocks,</b> <b>phosphatic</b> fertilizer usage, and sewage sludge. Hydrochemical analysis showed that the anion composition of all the ground and surface water sources was dominated by bicarbonate (as CaCO 3), chloride and sulfate with almost insignificant contribution from phosphate and nitrate, the order being HCO 3 −[*]>[*]Cl−[*]>[*]SO 42 −[*]≫[*]>[*]PO 43 −[*]>[*]NO 3 −[*]>[*]F− in both the wet and the dry seasons.|$|R
