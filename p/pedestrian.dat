5|$|A regular {{international}} ferry {{service provided}} by Brittany Ferries operates from Millbay taking cars and foot passengers directly to France (Roscoff) and Spain (Santander) {{on the three}} ferries, MV Armorique, MV Bretagne and MV Pont-Aven. The Cremyll Ferry is a passenger ferry between Stonehouse and the Cornish hamlet of Cremyll, which {{is believed to have}} operated continuously since 1204. There is also a <b>pedestrian</b> ferry from the Mayflower Steps to Mount Batten, and an alternative to using the Tamar Bridge via the Torpoint Ferry (vehicle and <b>pedestrian)</b> across the River Tamar.|$|E
5|$|Further along {{from the}} Welsh Bridge is the Porthill Bridge, a <b>pedestrian</b> {{suspension}} bridge running between the Quarry and Porthill, built in 1922. The next bridge {{along the river}} is Kingsland Bridge, a privately owned toll bridge, and the subsequent bridge is the Greyfriars Bridge, a <b>pedestrian</b> bridge between Coleham and the town centre. Following the Greyfriars Bridge is the English Bridge, historically called Stone Bridge, which was rebuilt in the 1930s. Beyond it is the railway station, which is partly built over the river. After the station is Castle Walk Footbridge, another modern <b>pedestrian</b> footbridge.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, the Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments (SCCOG) began a {{study of}} how to improve the Regional Intermodal Transportation Center (RITC), {{including}} Union Station. The study analyzed problems with the RITC – including poor <b>pedestrian</b> connections, minimal bus facilities, {{and a lack of}} food vendors – and considered but rejected a move to a Fort Trumbull site. The proposed alternative released in 2010, which would cost around $20 million, would relocate Water Street slightly to the west. The bus terminal would be expanded, with a new building adding onto the existing former baggage office. A <b>pedestrian</b> bridge was to be constructed connecting the Water Street Garage, the main station area, the northbound Amtrak platform, and the ferry terminal – a design that served station passengers as well as the ferries. Other <b>pedestrian</b> improvements were to include wayfinding signs, pedestrian-scale lighting, and expanded sidewalks.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s Dutch elm disease (Ceratocystis ulmi) {{killed off}} all the elms that once {{populated}} the park and crab apples were planted to replace the elms along the <b>pedestrian</b> mall. After deteriorating over the decades Washington Park saw a revival in the 1990s and 2000s with the flower beds being restored to their original specifications, the <b>pedestrian</b> mall removed of pavement and widened to its original dimensions with disease-resistant elms planted to form a canopy, the King Fountain relit at night, and the lilac shrub border around {{the periphery of the}} park being restored.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Zarqa, several bridges, {{vehicular}} and <b>pedestrian,</b> cross the river. The earliest of these was built by the Chechen founders of the city.

Two <b>pedestrian</b> bridges connect al-Zuhur Street and Baha' al-Din Street, and Wasfi al-Tal Street and Petra Street.|$|E
50|$|In January 2009, {{a notice}} issued to <b>pedestrians</b> {{walking to the}} customs complex caused {{confusion}} among <b>pedestrians</b> and the Singapore custom authorities.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a monocular night vision system specifically developed for detecting very distant <b>pedestrians.</b> The {{focus of the}} system is the recognition of <b>pedestrians</b> that are between 40 and 100 m away from the camera. The system is intended to integrate with an existing system, which is capable of detecting <b>pedestrians</b> at distances less than 40 m. At very large distances, <b>pedestrians</b> appear at low resolution, and this requires a specific detection algorithm, rather than an adaptation of an existing one. The presented system performs best in rural environments, where it can locate <b>pedestrians</b> at such great distances, that the <b>pedestrians</b> are hardly visible even to a human driver...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{presence}} {{of people in}} the city follows many cultural and social effects. The pedestrian-oriented spaces result in the {{presence of}} more <b>pedestrians</b> and hence increase cultural and social values; however, today with increasing cars, <b>pedestrians</b> are not considered more which significantly reduces the number of <b>pedestrians</b> walking in urban areas as well as cultural and social values. <b>Pedestrians</b> can also affect the urban identity. In this paper, the effect of <b>pedestrians</b> on the culture and identity of the city had been discussed. By investigating the current academic literature, studies concerning the <b>pedestrians,</b> urban space, culture and urban culture, identity and urban identity have been collected and finally, the effect of pedestrian-oriented spaces on the culture and urban identity have been discussed.   Since, the historic fabric of the city is the symbol of identity, part of this study discussing successful <b>pedestrians</b> that had been made in historical context...|$|R

40|$|We {{identified}} {{risk factors}} for road traffic injuries among road users who received treatment at two major trauma hospitals in urban Gambia. The study includes <b>pedestrians,</b> bicyclists, motorcyclists, and drivers/passengers of cars and trucks. We examined distributions of injury by age, gender, collision vehicle types and vehicle category, and driver and environment factors. Two hundred and fifty-four patients {{were included in the}} study. Two-thirds were male and one-third female. Two-thirds (67 %) of road traffic injuries involved <b>pedestrians,</b> bicyclists, and motorcyclists; and these were more common during weekdays (74 %) than weekends. Nearly half (47 %) of road traffic injuries involved <b>pedestrians.</b> One-third (34 %) of injured patients were students (mean age of students was less than 14 years), more than half (51 %) of whom were injured on the roadway as <b>pedestrians.</b> Head/skull injuries were common. Concussion/brain injuries were 3. 5 times higher among <b>pedestrians,</b> bicyclists, and motorcyclists than vehicle occupants. Crashes involving <b>pedestrians</b> were more likely to involve young people (< 25 years; aOR 6. 36, 95 % CI: 3. 32 – 12. 17) and involve being struck by a motor car (aOR 3. 95, 95 % CI: 2. 09 – 7. 47). <b>Pedestrians</b> contribute the largest proportion of hospitalizations in the Gambia. Young <b>pedestrians</b> are at particularly high risk.
