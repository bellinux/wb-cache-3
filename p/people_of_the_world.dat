5|$|Four months later, {{the player}} learns {{that the council}} city-states {{are now trying to}} find Remnants all around the world to use to fight the Conqueror, who is in turn binding and {{transforming}} the Remnants of the city-states, even those that are already bound. Rush and Irina's parents, once found, reveal that their research at the academy had been to create tablets that can transform Remnants and it is through one of these that Wagram stole that the Conqueror is able to do so. When the party travels to the God-Emperor's city, Undelwalt, to try to determine why he is supporting the Conqueror, they find Wagram, who tells them that the Conqueror is a Remnant himself. Wagram and the God-Emperor are supporting him in his quest to destroy the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> who are misusing Remnants and destroying the balance of the world.|$|E

25|$|His writing, {{which has}} been {{described}} as close to the people's voice, portrays the class struggle and the search for social justice of his countrymen and working class <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> His work usually mixes descriptions of the Ibero-American countryside and simple life beauty with naive humour and optimism with proletarian revolution conclusions and tone. This makes his work very popular among the intellectual middle classes and the working classes, specifically the campesinos (countryside people), who identify themselves with Changmarín's personality and language.

25|$|Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has {{invented the}} Esperanto language. It {{has all the}} {{potential}} qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice {{on the part of}} its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and {{become a part of the}} curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations. If one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not know the language. Therefore I hope that you will make the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread.|$|E

Rheannon also states that there is little coverage of social issues.

500|$|The plot of Deus Ex {{depicts a}} society on a slow spiral into chaos. There {{is a massive}} {{division}} {{between the rich and}} the poor, not only socially, but in some cities physically.

With no hope for the common <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> riots occur worldwide, and a number of terrorist organizations have formed with the professed intent of assisting the downtrodden, among them the National Secessionist Forces of the U.S. and a French group known as Silhouette.|$|E

After defeating Wagram, the party chases the Conqueror through the Sacred Lands, which are revealed to be the birthplace of Remnants and confronts him. He informs them that he is trying to release Remnants from the control of man and that the task was originally supposed to be Rush's, as he is also a Remnant. He believes that their purpose is to take back the Remnants from the world that in his opinion is misusing them for warfare and destruction and allow them in turn to destroy the <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Rush disagrees and instead destroys the source of the Remnants, sacrificing himself. The game ends with all of the Remnants disappearing around the world, but after the credits, Rush is heard talking with the Conqueror, saying; [...] "I'm going back. They're waiting for me".|$|E
