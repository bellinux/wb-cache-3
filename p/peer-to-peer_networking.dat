In August 1993, Windows for Workgroups, a special version with integrated <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networking</b> features and a version number of 3.11, was released. It was sold along Windows 3.1. Support for Windows 3.1 ended on December 31, 2001.|$|E

25|$|The {{application}} layer is the scope within which applications create user data and communicate this data to other applications on another {{or the same}} host. The applications, or processes, {{make use of the}} services provided by the underlying, lower layers, especially the Transport Layer which provides reliable or unreliable pipes to other processes. The communications partners are characterized by the application architecture, such as the client-server model and <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networking.</b> This is the layer in which all higher level protocols, such as SMTP, FTP, SSH, HTTP, operate. Processes are addressed via ports which essentially represent services.|$|E

25|$|On {{starting}} a session, a workspace, which contains a presentation area, is displayed. A list of notes are also shown. A list of {{users in the}} local subnet, with whom a collaboration session can be started, are automatically detected by using the People Near Me functionality, based on WS-Discovery in the <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networking</b> implementation in Windows Vista. Users outside the local subnet must be sent an e-mail or file invitation to participate. Applications can be shared in the session, which will be local to that session only. When an application is shared, Windows Meeting Space switches into presentation mode so that participants can see what the presenter is working on and collaboratively edit or review the shared application instance.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, several {{subscribers}} of Comcast high-speed Internet {{discovered that}} Comcast was interfering with {{their use of}} <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networking</b> applications. [...] Challenging Comcast's interference, Free Press and Public Knowledge—two non-profit advocacy organizations—filed {{a complaint with the}} FCC. [...] The complaint stated that Comcast's actions violated the FCC Internet Policy Statement, particularly violating the statement's principle that “consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice... to run applications and use services of their choice.” [...] Comcast defended its interference with consumers' peer-to-peer programs as necessary to manage scarce network capacity.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992 and 1993, Microsoft {{released}} Windows for Workgroups (WfW), {{which was}} available {{both as an}} add-on for existing Windows 3.1 installations and in a version that included the base Windows environment and the networking extensions all in one package. Windows for Workgroups included improved network drivers and protocol stacks, and support for <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networking.</b> [...] There were two versions of Windows for Workgroups, WfW 3.1 and WfW 3.11. Unlike prior versions, Windows for Workgroups 3.11 ran in 386 Enhanced Mode only, and needed at least an 80386SX processor. One optional download for WfW was the [...] "Wolverine" [...] TCP/IP protocol stack, which allowed for {{easy access to the}} Internet through corporate networks.|$|E

2500|$|Organized {{crime is}} {{involved}} in the production and distribution of child pornography, which is found as a common element of organized crime profiles. Organized into groups to produce and distribute pornography, they are often called [...] "sex rings." [...] In 2003, an international police investigation uncovered a Germany-based child pornography ring involving 26,500 suspects who swapped illegal images on the Internet in 166 different countries. In a 2006 case, US and international authorities charged 27 people in nine states and three countries in connection with a child pornography ring that US federal authorities described as [...] "one of the worst" [...] they have discovered. The assistant secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement added that the case reflected three larger trends that are becoming more common in child pornography rings. One is the increasing prevalence of [...] "home-grown" [...] pornographic images that are produced by predators themselves, and include live streaming video images of children being abused, not just the circulation of repeated images. Another trend is the growing use of sophisticated security measures and of <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networking,</b> in which participants can share files with one another on their computers rather than downloading them from a web site. The group used encryption and data destruction software to protect the files and screening measures to ensure only authorized participants could enter the chat room. A third trend is the increasingly violent and graphic nature of the images involving the abuse of younger children.|$|E

50|$|Peer-to-peer {{file sharing}} is the {{distribution}} and sharing of digital media using <b>peer-to-peer</b> (P2P) <b>networking</b> technology. P2P file sharing allows users to access media files such as books, music, movies, and games using a P2P software program that searches for other connected computers on a P2P network to locate the desired content. The nodes (peers) of such networks are end-user computers and distribution servers (not required).|$|R

Windows Vista also included a peer-to-peer API for name resolution and secure Group creation. This functionality can be accessed from the Winsock API as well. The <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networking</b> subsystem can discover others running the service in the local subnet, using a feature dubbed People Near Me and integrate with Windows Contacts to manage and store contact information. This facility can be used to develop ad-hoc collaborative applications, such as Windows Meeting Space. <b>Peer-to-peer</b> <b>networking</b> settings are configurable through netsh p2p and Group Policy.|$|E

50|$|SNA network {{installation}} and maintenance are complicated and SNA network products are (or were) expensive. Attempts to reduce SNA network complexity by adding IBM Advanced <b>Peer-to-Peer</b> <b>Networking</b> functionality were not really successful, if only because the migration from traditional SNA to SNA/APPN was very complex, without providing much additional value, at least initially. SNA software licences (VTAM) {{cost as much as}} $10000 a month for high-end systems. And SNA IBM 3745 Communications Controllers typically cost over $100K. TCP/IP was still seen as unfit for commercial applications e.g. in the finance industry until the late 1980s, but rapidly took over in the 1990s due to its <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networking</b> and packet communication technology.|$|E

50|$|Before 2006, most {{services}} used <b>peer-to-peer</b> (P2P) <b>networking,</b> {{in which}} users downloaded an application and data would be shared between the users {{rather than the}} service provider giving the now more commonly used streaming method. Now most service providers have {{moved away from the}} P2P systems and are now using the streaming media. The old P2P service was selected because the existing infrastructure could not handle the bandwidth necessary for centralized streaming distribution. Some consumers didn't like their upload bandwidth being consumed by their video player, which partially motivated the roll-out of centralized streaming distribution.|$|R
40|$|Cellular mobile devices, and in {{particular}} smartphones, have become ubiquitous. While bandwidth has steadily increased from 2 G devices with Edge to 3 G and now 3 G LTE (4 G), so has the demand for bandwidth intensive applications and streaming of multimedia content.

In this paper, we describe an approach to <b>peer-to-peer</b> cooperative <b>networking</b> that exploits the WiFi interface in peer-to-peer mode {{in order to reduce}} the demand on the cellular network while at the same time increasing the reliability of data delivery.
