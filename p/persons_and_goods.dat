25|$|In 1897, the {{completion}} of the Matadi-Leopoldville railway, but especially the foundation of Pointe-Noire in 1922, in view of the construction of a deep-water port and a railway line, will precipitate the decline of the Capital Loango. Indeed, its bay with its low draught does not allow the landing of ships for the traffic of <b>persons</b> <b>and</b> <b>goods.</b> Loango then only welcomes the burials of the nobles Vili and the settlers.|$|E

60|$|Publishing is, however, {{only one}} of the many similar trades equally {{profitable}} and equally likely to move outward to secondary centres, with the development and cheapening of transit. It is all a question of transit. Limitation of transit contracts the city, facilitation expands and disperses it.

40|$|A split {{review of}} the {{environmental}} impact of Norwegian consumption and production over the last decade illustrates that rising consumption is eliminating the bonus of eco-efficiency in production. Two key drivers behind this situation are the large increase in <b>person</b> <b>and</b> <b>goods</b> transportation <b>and</b> an increase in wealth that has allowed Norwegians to spend more on purchasing products and services. To achieve a sustainable development in rich countries, two major adjustments to the prevailing environmental policy are suggested: (1) The environmental impact of consumption should also be monitored as part of the official sustainability indicator monitoring system, e. g., by calculating the ecological footprint. (2) A specific consumption focus in environmental policy should be developed, beginning with the consumption categories with the largest footprint (volume) and the most negative development (change) ...|$|R
