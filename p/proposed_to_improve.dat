5|$|An earlier canal {{had been}} built in the Middle Ages to supply Glastonbury Abbey and the town with stone and produce. In the early 19th century a new canal was <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> {{commerce}} in Glastonbury and help with drainage of the surrounding area of the Somerset Levels. Several alternative routes were considered and costed before obtaining an Act of Parliament and issuing a prospectus to raise funds for the building of the canal. Construction commenced in the 1820s; however it was more expensive than envisaged and further funds had to be raised. It finally opened in 1833 but was only prosperous for a short period. The shortfall in income and engineering problems with water supply and waterlogged peat causing the clay puddling to fracture meant that it was sold to the Bristol and Exeter Railway. They used the canal to transport materials for the construction of the new Somerset Central Railway which opened in 1854.|$|E

500|$|Several {{additional}} hypotheses {{have been}} <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> upon and reconcile the LDR and BDR hypotheses. One predominantly favored hypothesis, first developed by Günter P. Wagner and Jacques Gauthier in 1999, involves a [...] "frameshift" [...] of the digits; the first digit fails {{to grow in}} the first developmental site due to not receiving the necessary signals, which has the effect of shifting digits I-III to the positions of II-IV. Thus, while digits I-III from the ancestral theropod are retained, they do not grow in the same location. A version of the frameshift hypothesis modified to incorporate both elements of BDR and fossil evidence from Limusaurus and other theropods, the [...] "thumbs down" [...] hypothesis of Capek et al., suggests that this frameshift took place after the reduction of both the first and the fourth digits in the theropod lineage. The major alternative hypothesis supported by Xu Xing et al., known as the [...] "lateral shift hypothesis", considers a partial, step-wise frameshift in which, from a four-fingered hand with reduced digits I and IV, I fully disappears while IV develops into a fully-fledged finger, with II-IV taking on the morphologies of the former I-III.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{policies}} have been <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> data collection and transparency in livestock production. [...] For example, the 2013 Delivering Antimicrobial Transparency in Animals (DATA) Act proposed the enactment of policies to acquire more accurate documentation of antibiotic use in growth promotion by farmers, drug manufacturers, and the FDA. [...] Also, the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act (PAMTA) was enacted to eliminate the use of medically important antibiotics in livestock. [...] In 2015, the Preventing Antibiotic Resistance Act (PARA) was passed with two components: requirement of drug companies to provide evidence that antibiotics that are approved for use in poultry, and that meat production does not add to the growing threat of antibiotic resistance in humans. Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) serve {{as an example of}} systematic monitoring and analysis of data via interdisciplinary and multi-sectoral collaboration.|$|E
2500|$|The Healthy Americans Act (HAA), {{also known}} as the Wyden-Bennett Act, is a Senate bill that had <b>proposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> health care in the United States, with changes that {{included}} the establishment of universal health care. It would transition away from employer-provided health insurance, to employer-subsidized insurance, having instead individuals choose their health care plan from state-approved private insurers. It sought to make the cost of health insurance more transparent to consumers, with the expectation being that this would increase market pressures to drive health insurance costs down. The proposal created a system that would be paid for by both public and private contributions. It would establish Healthy Americans Private Insurance Plans (HAPIs) and require those who do not already have health insurance coverage, and who do not oppose health insurance on religious grounds, to enroll themselves and their children in a HAPI. According to its sponsors, it would guarantee universal, affordable, comprehensive, portable, high-quality, private health coverage that is as good or better than Members of Congress have today; [...] A 2008 preliminary analysis by the Congressional Budget Office concluded it would be [...] "essentially" [...] self-financing in the first year that it was fully implemented.|$|E
