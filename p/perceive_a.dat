During this period, Australian minesweepers and frigates patrolled Malaysia's coastline to counter Indonesian infiltration parties travelling in small craft. These ships also bombarded Indonesian positions in East Kalimantan near the border with Malaysia on several occasions. The RAN's experiences during this conflict led it to <b>perceive</b> <b>a</b> need for light destroyers and patrol boats tailored to Confrontation-type tasks.|$|E
5|$|Theatre also greatly {{influenced}} Alejo Carpentier's work. In all his work, Carpentier uses the characters he creates {{to explore the}} notions of subjectivity and identity, analyzing {{the way in which}} individuals see themselves and others within cultural settings. In order to achieve such an analysis, Carpentier makes use of spectatorship: his characters <b>perceive</b> <b>a</b> spectacle in alterable ways which parallel their alterable ways of experiencing the world. Spectacle situations are also sometimes used by Carpentier as a tool for the characters to reframe and rethink the world, as well as to establish individual and group identity.|$|E

This study looked at the relation between work commitment and participant's perception of meaning in their job. Participants were tested in the areas of; <b>perceiving</b> <b>a</b> calling, job satisfaction, and job commitment. Results showed a moderate correlation between participants <b>perceiving</b> <b>a</b> calling and job commitment and a weak correlation between <b>perceiving</b> <b>a</b> calling and job satisfaction.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between and among parents, teachers, and administrators of elementary, junior and senior high school students regarding their perceptions of the difference between the present and desired applications of computer technology. The areas of computer technology were computer assisted instruction, computer managed instruction, and computer literacy. ^ The needs assessment survey, Applications of Computer Technology, was developed for the study. Respondents indicated to what extent they felt the school currently applied a particular area of computer technology and to what extent it should be applied. Responses were analyzed for each computer technology area by level (elementary, junior and senior high school) and sub-group (parents, teachers, and administrators). ^ The sample population was selected, through a random sampling technique, from parents, teachers, and administrators associated with the Lincoln Public Schools, Lincoln, Nebraska. ^ The following conclusions were drawn based on the perceptions of parents, teachers, and administrators surveyed: (1) Parents, teachers, and administrators <b>perceived</b> <b>a</b> need for greater implementation in all areas of computer technology. (2) Parents <b>perceived</b> <b>a</b> greater need for further implementation of computer assisted instruction and computer literacy than did teachers and administrators. (3) Elementary school parents, teachers, and administrators <b>perceived</b> <b>a</b> greater need for further implementation of computer managed instruction than junior high school parents, teachers, and administrators. (4) Parents of junior high school students <b>perceived</b> <b>a</b> greater need for further implementation of computer assisted instruction than elementary school parents. (5) Elementary school teachers <b>perceived</b> <b>a</b> greater need for further implementation of computer managed instruction than junior and senior high school teachers. Elementary school teachers also <b>perceived</b> <b>a</b> greater need for the implementation of computer literacy than senior high school teachers. (6) Elementary school administrators <b>perceived</b> <b>a</b> greater need for further implementation of computer managed instruction than junior high school administrators. ...|$|R

25|$|Upon seeing {{photographs}} of straight, gay, and bisexual people, participants correctly identified gay versus straight {{males and females}} at above-chance levels based solely on seeing a picture of their face, however, bisexual targets were only identified at chance. The data suggest that people do not differentiate between bisexual targets and gay targets, but do <b>perceive</b> <b>a</b> difference between straight targets and those who identify as either bisexual or gay.|$|E
25|$|These {{behavioral}} {{divisions are}} not permanent. For instance, if an alpha female {{is removed from}} a nest, then another female, usually the second-most dominant, beta female, assumes the role and behavioral profile of the removed dominant. Indeed, individuals alternate between different profiles of behavior within their own dominance rank position. When larvae were artificially removed, the frequency of worker reproduction increased. Therefore, workers lay eggs when they <b>perceive</b> <b>a</b> decline in queen power, as demonstrated by artificially empty cells.|$|E

25|$|Many {{languages}} {{spoken in}} Africa are tonal languages, {{leading to a}} close connection between music and language in some local cultures. These particular communities use vocal sounds and movements with their music as well. In singing, the tonal pattern or the text puts some constraints on the melodic patterns. On the other hand, in instrumental music a native speaker of a language can often <b>perceive</b> <b>a</b> text or texts in the music. This effect also forms the basis of drum languages (talking drums).|$|E
25|$|Multisensory integration, {{also known}} as {{multimodal}} integration, {{is the study of}} how information from the different sensory modalities, such as sight, sound, touch, smell, self-motion and taste, may be integrated by the nervous system. A coherent representation of objects combining modalities enables us to have meaningful perceptual experiences. Indeed, multisensory integration is central to adaptive behavior because it allows us to <b>perceive</b> <b>a</b> world of coherent perceptual entities. Multisensory integration also deals with how different sensory modalities interact with one another and alter each other's processing.|$|E
25|$|Following a {{confirmed}} detection, another important variable considered in a PDP is {{the speed with}} which the facts of the discovery would become public knowledge. For instance, should a signal of ET origin be sufficiently ambiguous or otherwise difficult to interpret, the detecting party may <b>perceive</b> <b>a</b> need to withhold information about the discovery to prevent unintended reactions from the general public or other political entities. Likewise, the detecting party could choose to limit information release in a bid to exploit the contact for personal gain.|$|E

These concerns include the protests against the 1960s effort to push a freeway through (and over) parts of the East Side, to a perception that municipal spending and planning favours {{other areas of the}} city (especially the West Side), to recent debates, such as expansion of the Port of Vancouver operation in East Vancouver and the expansion of the Port Mann bridge and predicted increased traffic through the East Side.|$|E
25|$|When the Colonies {{declared}} independence, many Floridians condemned it. They {{had been}} almost unaffected (because East and West Florida were backwoods areas) by the Stamp Act Crisis of 1765, which led the 13 colonies to <b>perceive</b> <b>a</b> common interest threatened by Britain. Florida declined to send delegates to the Continental Congress. The majority of Floridians were Loyalists, grateful to the Crown, that remained loyal to Britain. Many actually helped lead raids on the American South. One disastrous attempt {{on the part of}} the American Forces to invade East Florida occurred at the Battle of Thomas Creek in Nassau County. It was led on May 17, 1777. American Colonel John Baker surrendered to the British. Another attempt, the Battle of Alligator Bridge took place on June 30, 1778.|$|E

Her experiences in the culture have fueled an interest to preserve cultural traditions and understand the impact of the past on contemporary life. A well-known novelist and poet, Silko's career has been characterized by making people aware of ingrained racism and white cultural imperialism, and a commitment to support women's issues. Her novels have many characters who attempt what some <b>perceive</b> <b>a</b> simple yet uneasy return to balance Native American traditions survivalism with the violence of modern America. The clash of civilizations is a continuing theme in the modern Southwest and of the difficult search for balance that the region’s inhabitants encounter.|$|E

25|$|Boa constrictors {{generally}} live {{on their}} own, {{and do not}} interact with any other snakes unless they want to mate. They are nocturnal, but they may bask during the day when night-time temperatures are too low. As semi-arboreal snakes, young boa constrictors may climb into trees and shrubs to forage; however, they become mostly terrestrial as they become older and heavier. Boa constrictors strike when they <b>perceive</b> <b>a</b> threat. Their bite can be painful, especially from large snakes, but is rarely dangerous to humans. Specimens from Central America are more irascible, hissing loudly and striking repeatedly when disturbed, while those from South America tame down more readily. Like all snakes, boa constrictors in a shed cycle are more unpredictable, because the substance that lubricates between the old skin and the new makes their eyes appear milky, blue, or opaque, so that the snake cannot see very well, causing it to be more defensive than it might be otherwise.|$|E
25|$|The Northern and Western {{parts of}} the city, which are closer to the Fijeh springs, receive better service than the Southern and Eastern parts {{that are at the}} end of the {{distribution}} network. Service is also better in winter when the yield of the spring is highest. During winter residents in the Northwestern parts of Damascus typically receive a continuous flow of water, while residents in the Southeastern {{parts of the}} city receive water for only a few hours per day or even every couple of days during summer. For example, the town of Sahenya, 16km south-west of Damascus, was for 10 days without water in 2006. Most houses in Damascus have rooftop tanks to store water during periods of supply. Many houses have dual plumbing systems, with one tap for water that comes directly from the network and another tap for water that comes from the rooftop tank. As a consequence, many residents do not <b>perceive</b> <b>a</b> water crisis during most of the year, because they have sufficient water either from the network or from their rooftop tanks.|$|E
25|$|Phantom limbs are a {{phenomenon}} which occurs following amputation of a limb from an individual. In 90–98% of cases, amputees report feeling {{all or part}} of the limb or body part still there, taking up space. The amputee may <b>perceive</b> <b>a</b> limb under full control, or paralyzed. A common side effect of phantom limbs is phantom limb pain. The neurophysiological mechanisms by which phantom limbs occur is still under debate. A common theory posits that the afferent neurons, since deafferented due to amputation, typically remap to adjacent cortical regions within the brain. This can cause amputees to report feeling their missing limb being touched when a seemingly unrelated part of the body is stimulated (such as if the face is touched, but the amputee also feels their missing arm being stroked in a specific location). Another facet of phantom limbs is that the efferent copy (motor feedback) responsible for reporting on position to the body schema does not attenuate quickly. Thus the missing body part may be attributed by the amputee to still be in a fixed or movable position.|$|E
