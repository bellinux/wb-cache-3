5|$|The GCV {{must have}} been {{transportable}} by cargo aircraft, rail, and ship. The Army required it to meet the availability rates of the current Stryker. The Army did not limit the vehicle by {{the dimensions of the}} C-130 Hercules, which, in the past, constrained many designs. Air mobility would be provided by the more spacious C-17 Globemaster III. The GCV was to have good cross-country mobility, with a baseline requirement of 30mph off-road speed. The GCV should have delivered higher sustainability levels and consume less fuel than the Bradley or other vehicles of similar weight and power. The military was accepting both tracked and wheeled designs. The operational maintenance cost requirement of the GCV was up to $200 <b>per</b> <b>mile,</b> compared to $168 <b>per</b> <b>mile</b> for the M2 Bradley.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the time}} {{required}} to electrify the network the MTT continued to run horse trams until 1914. The cost of purchasing the tramways was funded by treasury bills and the act capped total construction costs at £12,000 <b>per</b> <b>mile</b> of track. £457,000 was let in contracts to March 1908 for construction of the tramways, trams, strengthening the Adelaide bridge over the River Torrens and associated works.

5|$|In 1854 {{there were}} five or six trains a day between Darlington and Redcar and three a day between Darlington and Frosterly. Travelling at average speeds of , {{passengers}} were charged from 1d <b>per</b> <b>mile</b> for third class to 2.2d <b>per</b> <b>mile</b> for first. Horses were still used on trains in the mid-1850s: a horse-drawn coach was still independently operated between Middlesbrough and Stockton in 1854 on Sundays, as the only S services that run on that day were the mail trains, and locomotives replaced horses on passenger trains to West Auckland in 1856. The S opened a carriage works south of Darlington North Road station in 1853 and later it built a locomotive works nearby to replace its works at Shildon. Designed by William Bouch, who had taken over from Hackworth as Locomotive Supervisor in 1840, it completed its first locomotive in 1864. In 1858 the Brusselton Inclines were bypassed by {{a line from the}} north end of Shildon Tunnel; the same year a passenger service started on the Hagger Leases branch and a mineral line opened from Crook via two inclines to Waterhouse. The section of the SD between West Auckland and Barnard Castle opened for minerals in July 1863 and passengers on 1 August 1863, together with a direct line from Bishop Auckland to West Auckland. Stations at Evenwood and Cockfield replaced stations on the Hagger Leases branch.|$|E

In anticipation of such a move, local officials and the military proposed extending the Blue and Green Lines to service each base. The proposed extension of the Green Line could cost $100 million <b>per</b> <b>mile</b> ($60 million per kilometer), and a light rail extension to Fort Belvoir was estimated to cost up to $800 million.

5|$|On September 15, 2014, Marshall County {{officials}} {{brought the}} extension of I-68 up again {{as a way for}} oil companies to have easier access to drill into the area, likely by fracking. Much like the second leg of the Southern Beltway in the Pittsburgh area, an extension of I-68 is being spurred in response to the Marcellus natural gas trend. If the extension were to be built, it would also include a widening of WV2 to four lanes and would cost an estimated $5 million <b>per</b> <b>mile.</b> It is expected that the project would be divided into two legs, first from Morgantown to Cameron, then Cameron to Moundsville.|$|E
5|$|This work {{led to an}} {{interesting}} discovery. When an engine was optimized specifically for high speed, it burned perhaps twice as much fuel at that speed than when it was running at subsonic speeds. However, the aircraft would be flying as much as four times as fast. Thus its most economical cruise speed, in terms of fuel <b>per</b> <b>mile,</b> was its maximum speed. This was entirely unexpected and implied {{that there was no}} point in the dash concept; if the aircraft was able to reach Mach3, it may as well fly its entire mission at that speed. The question remained whether such a concept was technically feasible, but by March1957, engine development and wind tunnel testing had progressed enough to suggest it was.|$|E

5|$|Construction on the Arroyo Seco Parkway, {{designed}} {{under the}} leadership of District Chief Engineer Spencer V. Cortelyou and Design Engineer A. D. Griffin, began with a groundbreaking ceremony in South Pasadena on March 22, 1938 and generally progressed from Pasadena southwest. The first contract, stretching less than a mile (1.5km) from Glenarm Street in Pasadena around Raymond Hill to Fair Oaks Avenue in South Pasadena, and including no bridges, was opened to traffic on December 10, 1938. A 3.7-mile (6.0km) section opened on July 20, 1940, connecting Orange Grove Avenue in South Pasadena with Avenue 40 in Los Angeles. The remainder in Los Angeles, from Avenue 40 southwest to the Figueroa Street Viaduct at Avenue 22, was opened on December 30, 1940, in time for the Tournament of Roses Parade and Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. However, the highway through South Pasadena was not completed until January 30, 1941, and landscaping work continued through September. The final cost of $5.75 million, under $1 million <b>per</b> <b>mile,</b> was extremely low for a freeway project because the terrain was favorable for grade separations.|$|E
5|$|The {{cost was}} $490 million (equivalent to $ million today) to build , 40 times {{the average cost}} <b>per</b> <b>mile</b> {{predicted}} by the planners of the Interstate Highway system. This figure exceeded that of Interstate 15 through the Virgin River Gorge, which was previously proclaimed the most expensive rural freeway in the United States. The construction of I-70 through Glenwood Canyon earned 30 awards for the Colorado Department of Transportation, including the 1993 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award from the American Society of Civil Engineers. At the dedication it was claimed that I-70 through Glenwood Canyon was the final piece of the Interstate Highway System to open to traffic. For this reason, the system was proclaimed to be complete. However, as of 2009, at least two sections of the original Interstate Highway System have not been constructed: a section of Interstate 95 in central New Jersey, and a section of I-70 in Breezewood, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|After 1976, gaps in {{the belt}} route were present from 2100 North near the airport to SR-201 and from State Street in Murray to 4600 South in Holladay. The first step in {{completing}} the gap was taken in June 1979, when construction of the interstate from State Street to 700 East began. This {{was followed by the}} Cottonwood Inc. lawsuit being awarded in favor of UDOT in November 1979. In July 1985, the route from 280 East to Union Park Avenue was completed. At the time, this portion of road was the most expensive in the state in terms of cost <b>per</b> <b>mile,</b> due to the road being depressed below surrounding neighborhoods. The next section to open was from 2100 North south to I-80 in 1987. This was followed by a section between Union Park Avenue and 2000 East, opened in November 1987, which was also built as a sunken freeway. The western quadrant of the freeway was completed in October 1988, closing the gap between SR-201 and I-80 (however, the California Avenue interchange wasn't opened until mid-1989). In August 1989, the road from 2000 East to 6200 South was finished, and the belt route was completed with the opening of freeway between 4500 South and 6200 South in October 1989.|$|E
