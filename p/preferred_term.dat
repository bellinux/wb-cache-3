40|$|A brief {{review of}} the rich {{heritage}} of classifications and terminologies is the background for {{a description of the}} Mayo Clinic's clinical terminology development. Vender specific system constraints prompted the scope and style of an interim problem list vocabulary. We describe the sources and review process which led to a working terminology for use in a Computer-based Patient Record (CPR). Because terminology development is often subjective and metrics against which to measure the quality of individual human judgements are few, we decided to compare the selection of <b>preferred</b> <b>terms</b> made by general internists with those made by sub-specialists. A significant difference between a sub-specialist's assignment of <b>preferred</b> <b>terms</b> and a general internist's (948 vs. 2271, P < 0. 001) was observed. Sub-specialists were less than half as likely as a generalist to designate a <b>term</b> as a <b>preferred</b> form.

25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) has {{recommended}} {{sexually transmitted infection}} as the <b>preferred</b> <b>term</b> since 1999. Sexually transmitted infection is a broader term than sexually transmitted disease. An infection is a colonization by a parasitic species, which may not cause any adverse effects. In a disease, the infection leads to impaired or abnormal function. In either case, the condition may not exhibit signs or symptoms. Increased understanding of infections like HPV, which infects {{a significant portion of}} sexually active individuals but cause disease in only a few, has led to increased use of the term STI. Public health officials originally introduced the term sexually transmitted infection, which clinicians are increasingly using alongside the term sexually transmitted disease in order to distinguish it from the former.|$|E
25|$|In Principles of Geology (first edition, vol. 3, Ch. 2, 1833) Lyell {{proposed}} that icebergs {{could be the}} means of transport for erratics. During periods of global warming, ice breaks off the poles and floats across submerged continents, carrying debris with it, he conjectured. When the iceberg melts, it rains down sediments upon the land. Because this theory could account for the presence of diluvium, the word drift became the <b>preferred</b> <b>term</b> for the loose, unsorted material, today called till. Furthermore, Lyell believed that the accumulation of fine angular particles covering much of the world (today called loess) was a deposit settled from mountain flood water. Today some of Lyell's mechanisms for geological processes have been disproven, though many have stood the test of time. His observational methods and general analytical framework remain in use today as foundational principles in geology.|$|E
25|$|In September 1911, Vanagaitis started {{publishing}} journal Birutė which began {{using the term}} Lithuania Minor more often, competing with previous <b>preferred</b> <b>term</b> Prussian Lithuania. This reflected {{a shift in the}} understanding of the term Lithuania. The society early on adopted the green–white–red flag that was historically used in the region (its origins are unknown); the flag eventually became the flag of Lithuania Minor. While the society promoted events and symbols from the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (such as the struggles against the Teutonic Order during the Lithuanian Crusade or the image of Grand Duke Vytautas as the great leader), it remained politically loyal to the German Empire. Birutė provided the first alternative to the historical memory promoted by the German Empire or the Church. Prussian Lithuanians knew more about the House of Hohenzollern and Margraviate of Brandenburg than about the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was an early attempt at finding own distinctive history and identity, which was continued by other organizations. While Birutė was plagued by lack of leadership and internal disagreements, its amateur concerts and theater performances sought to prove that the Lithuanian language was viable and equal to other languages.|$|E

40|$|Background. Understanding {{the patient}} safety {{literature}} has been compromised by the inconsistent use of language. Objectives. To identify key concepts of {{relevance to the}} International Patient Safety Classification (ICPS) proposed by the World Alliance For Patient Safety of the World Health Organization (WHO), and agree on definitions and <b>preferred</b> <b>terms.</b> Methods. Six principles were agreed upon—that the concepts and terms should: be applicable across {{the full spectrum of}} healthcare; be consistent with concepts from other WHO Classifications; have meanings {{as close as possible to}} those in colloquial use; convey the appropriate meanings with respect to patient safety; be brief and clear, without unnecessary or redundant qualifiers; be fit-for-purpose for the ICPS. Results. Definitions and <b>preferred</b> <b>terms</b> were agreed for 48 concepts of relevance to the ICPS; these were described and the relationships between them and the ICPS were outlined.

500|$|Sarah Graham {{wrote in}} Ariel, a journal {{published}} by the University of Calgary, that Eugenides' [...] "persisen" [...] {{use of the word}} [...] "hermaphrodite", instead of [...] "intersex", alludes to Hermaphroditus. Hermaphroditus, a young man, is chased by the nymph Salmacis. She begs the Gods to bind her and Hermaphroditus together, and the Gods literally fulfill her wish. Hermaphroditus' name is a compound of his parent's names—Hermes and Aphrodite. He instantaneously turns into someone of both sexes. Devastated because he is no longer fully male, he [...] "curses" [...] the location where he first met Salmacis. Graham stated that the use of [...] "hermaphrodite" [...] carries negative connotations: Based on this origin story, the hermaphrodite's lot is miserable, associated with disempowerment, the theft of identity and an unhappy dual existence. In addition, the term [...] "hermaphrodite" [...] may be deemed problematic because it alludes to an impossible state of being: no-one can be equally male and female and the <b>preferred</b> <b>term</b> [...] "intersex" [...] indicates a blended rather than divided state. While the modern term might indicate the possibility of redefining sexual ambivalence, Cal is associated in the novel with the mythic term and all it connotes. His connection to this tragic figure is confirmed by his performance as [...] "Hermaphroditus" [...] in a sex show at the age of fourteen, just as he is beginning his female to male transition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The Systematic Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) {{is being}} {{advocated}} {{as the foundation}} for encoding clinical documentation. While the electronic medical record is likely to {{play a critical role in}} pharmacovigilance - the detection of adverse events due to medications - classification and reporting of Adverse Events is currently based on the Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Complete and high-quality MedDRA-to-SNOMED CT mappings can therefore facilitate pharmacovigilance. The existing mappings, as determined through the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), are partial, and record only one-to-one correspondences even though SNOMED CT can be used compositionally. Efforts to map previously unmapped MedDRA concepts would be most productive if focused on concepts that occur frequently in actual adverse event data. We aimed to identify aspects of MedDRA that complicate mapping to SNOMED CT, determine pattern in unmapped high-frequency MedDRA concepts, and to identify types of integration errors in the mapping of MedDRA to UMLS. Methods Using one years' data from the US Federal Drug Administrations Adverse Event Reporting System, we identified MedDRA <b>preferred</b> <b>terms</b> that collectively accounted for 95 % of both Adverse Events and Therapeutic Indications records. After eliminating those already mapping to SNOMED CT, we attempted to map the remaining 645 Adverse-Event and 141 Therapeutic-Indications <b>preferred</b> <b>terms</b> with software assistance. Results All but 46 Adverse-Event and 7 Therapeutic-Indications <b>preferred</b> <b>terms</b> could be composed using SNOMED CT concepts: none of these required more than 3 SNOMED CT concepts to compose. We describe the common composition patterns in the paper. About 30 % of both Adverse-Event and Therapeutic-Indications <b>Preferred</b> <b>Terms</b> corresponded to single SNOMED CT concepts: the correspondence was detectable by human inspection but had been missed during the integration process, which had created duplicated concepts in UMLS. Conclusions Identification of composite mapping patterns, and the types of errors that occur in the MedDRA content within UMLS, can focus larger-scale efforts on improving the quality of such mappings, which may assist in the creation of an adverse-events ontology. </p...|$|R
