6000|$|Nobody went to {{bed that}} night, but {{in the morning the}} report was the same: [...] "Unconscious--a {{question}} of hours." [...] Once only did he recover consciousness, and then asked for Harz. A telegram had come from him, he was on the way. Towards seven of the evening the long-expected storm broke in a sky like ink. Into the valleys and over the crests of mountains it seemed as though an unseen hand were spilling goblets of <b>pale</b> <b>wine,</b> darting a sword-blade zigzag over trees, roofs, spires, peaks, into the very firmament, which answered every thrust with great bursts of groaning. Just beyond the veranda Greta saw a glowworm shining, as it might be a tiny bead of the fallen lightning. Soon the rain covered everything. Sometimes a jet of light brought the hilltops, towering, dark, and hard, over the house, to disappear again behind the raindrops and shaken leaves. Each breath drawn by the storm was like the clash of a thousand cymbals; and in his room Mr. Treffry lay unconscious of its fury.|$|E

5000|$|European table {{wines are}} {{generally}} {{made from the}} highest-yielding sites and vinified in an industrial manner. In the 1950s, when per capita consumption of wine was much higher, {{there was a need}} for vast quantities of cheap wine, but now much of it goes into the European Union's troublesome [...] "wine lake."

25|$|The {{history of}} Champagne {{has seen the}} wine evolve from being a <b>pale,</b> pinkish still <b>wine</b> to the {{sparkling}} wine now associated with the region. The Romans {{were the first to}} plant vineyards in this area of northeast France, with the region being cultivated by at least the 5th century, possibly earlier. When Hugh Capet was crowned King of France in 987 at the cathedral of Reims, located {{in the heart of the}} region, he started a tradition that brought successive monarchs to the region—with the local wine being on prominent display at the coronation banquets. The early wine of the Champagne region was a <b>pale,</b> pinkish <b>wine</b> made from Pinot noir.|$|R

2500|$|Today, White Zinfandels are {{considered}} part of the [...] "blush wine" [...] category of noticeably sweet, <b>pale</b> pink <b>wines</b> that often have very slight carbonation to give the wine a balance of acidity and some [...] "liveliness". Very often winemakers will blend aromatic varierties like Riesling, Gewürztraminer and Muscat to add to the fruity nose of the wine.|$|R
25|$|In the Valle d'Aosta DOC, locals {{refer to}} the {{indigenous}} grape Premetta as a rosato naturale due to the extremely thin and lightly pigmented skins of the variety that even with extended maceration can only produce a very <b>pale</b> rosé <b>wine.</b> According to wine experts Joe Bastianich and David Lynch, Valle d'Aosta Premetta rosés are very fruity with strawberry aromas and spicy cinnamon notes.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked hard}} at Harry {{as he walked}} in silence at my side; I stared at the houses we passed; I thought of the cab, the gas lighted hall in the Palace of Aladdin, the pictures, the letter, the oath, the dirk; the mysterious place where all these mysteries had occurred; and then, was almost ready to conclude, that the <b>pale</b> yellow <b>wine</b> had been drugged.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{created as}} a {{blending}} variety to add color to the <b>pale</b> red <b>wines</b> of Germany, plantings of Dornfelder were initially slow to take off. By 1970 there was only around 100 ha of the variety planted. The grape was officially approved for German wine production in 1980 with plantings rapidly increasing {{throughout the rest of}} the 20th century. From 2000 to 2005-2006, plantings again doubled as wine produced from Dornfelder earn commercial success.|$|R

The whole place seemed infected; and a strange thought came over me, that in the very damasks around, some eastern plague had been imported. And was that <b>pale</b> yellow <b>wine,</b> that I drank below, drugged? thought I. This must be some house whose foundations take hold on the pit. But these fearful reveries only enchanted me fast to my chair; so that, though I then wished to rush forth from the house, my limbs seemed manacled.|$|R
25|$|In the Jura wine region, the Arbois AOC makes very <b>pale,</b> pink red <b>wines</b> {{that are}} often mistaken for rosés from Pinot noir and the local Poulsard and Trousseau {{varieties}}. But the region also makes even paler actual rosés from the same grape varieties that are pressed {{after only a few}} hours of skin contact.|$|R
50|$|Pollino- The Pollino DOC {{is named}} for the nearby {{mountain}} range that forms part of the Apennines. Located near the border with Basilicata, the region produces <b>pale,</b> cherry red <b>wines</b> that need 2-3 years to develop. The wines are made primarily with Gaglioppo and Greco nero with up to 20% of white grape varieties permitted in the blend.|$|R
50|$|Producers in the Asti region try {{to model}} Grignolino on the wines of Beaujolais and those {{made from the}} Dolcetto grape in the Cuneo. These light bodied, <b>pale</b> colored <b>wines</b> are made to be {{consumed}} young and {{while waiting for the}} brawnier, Nebbiolo and Barbera based wines of the region age. While the grapes are relatively low in alcohol at around 11-12% ABV, they do have a significant amount of tannins due to the abundance of pips, or seeds. Modern winemaking techniques try to minimize the amount of tannin extraction by utilizing slow and gentle pressings. Wines made from Grignolino can have noticeably strong acidity and fruity aroma with alpine notes.|$|R
50|$|The {{olive oil}} of the {{district}} is abundant and good, {{and it is the}} peculiar flavour of the <b>pale</b> dry light <b>wine</b> of Montilla that gives its name to the sherry known as Amontillado. Montilla is the largest component of the Montilla-Moriles designated wine region. The large wineries Alvear and Gran Barquero are located in Montilla, which has an annual vendimia (wine-harvest) festival.|$|R
50|$|The sherry is {{manufactured}} {{using the}} same methods as a fino and results in a very <b>pale,</b> dry <b>wine.</b> In addition, the sherry {{is often described as}} having a salty flavour, believed to develop {{from the fact that it}} is manufactured on the sea estuary of the Guadalquivir river. Sanlúcar de Barrameda's cool temperatures and high humidity contribute to a higher yield of flor yeast than in Jerez or El Puerto de Santa María. The thicker cap of flor better protects the wine from contact with the air, resulting in a fresher, more delicate flavour than other varieties of fino. It is typically aged for five years in a solera, but some types may be aged longer.|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{the more}} {{continental}} {{climate of the}} Alta and Alavesa, the Rioja Baja is strongly influenced by a Mediterranean climate which makes this area the warmest and driest of the Rioja. In the summer months, drought can be a significant viticultural hazard, though since the late 1990s irrigation has been permitted. Temperatures in the summer typically reach 35°C (95 °F). A number of the vineyards are actually located in nearby Navarra but the wine produced from those grapes belongs to the Rioja appellation. Unlike the typically <b>pale</b> Rioja <b>wine,</b> Baja wines are very deeply coloured and can be highly alcoholic with some wines at 18% alcohol by volume. They typically do not have much acidity or aroma and are generally used as blending components with wines {{from other parts of}} the Rioja.|$|R
500|$|In 1977 a vine {{producing}} 'bronze' grapes {{was found}} in the vineyards of Cleggett Wines in Australia. They propagated this mutant, registered it under the name of Malian, and sold <b>pale</b> red <b>wines</b> under that name. In 1991 one of the Bronze Cabernet vines started producing white grapes. Cleggett registered this [...] "White Cabernet" [...] under the name of Shalistin. Compared to its Cabernet parent, Malian appears to lack anthocyanins in the subepidermal cells but retains them in the epidermis, whereas Shalistin has no anthocyanins in either layer. The team that went on to discover the VvMYBA1 and VvMYBA2 genes that control grape color have suggested that a gene involved in anthocyanin production has been deleted in the subepidermis of Malian, and then subepidermal cells invaded the epidermis to produce Shalistin.|$|R

2500|$|The term [...] "blush" [...] also {{originated}} in the 1970s when wine writer Jerry Mead visited the Sonoma County winery Mill Creek Vineyards and sampled a <b>pale,</b> pinkish <b>wine</b> that the winery made from Cabernet Sauvignon. The winemaker was thinking of calling the wine [...] "White Cabernet" [...] but Mead suggested the term [...] "blush" [...] instead. However, by the 1980s, white wines were still extremely popular among American consumers.

50|$|Dry white Graves de Vayres {{wines are}} made from 100% Sauvignon grapes. These wines are fresh, lively, and perfumed with floral notes and hints of citrus fruit. Barrel-fermented wines made with 100% Sémillon grapes are characterised by their slick, buttery, and rich, rounded texture. The sweet moelleux variety of Graves de Vayres is made from 100% Sémillon grapes, which are {{harvested}} only when they are over-ripe. This gives sweet and honey notes, and a <b>wine</b> <b>pale</b> yellow in colour. The majority of dry white Graves de Vayres is in fact composed of a blend of 70% Sauvignon, 20-25% Sémillion and 5-10% Muscadelle grapes.|$|R
5000|$|Poulsard (also Ploussard) {{is a red}} French {{wine grape}} variety from the Jura wine region. The name Ploussard is used mainly around the town of Pupillin but can appear on wine labels {{throughout}} Jura as an authorized synonyms. While technically a dark-skinned noir grape, the skins of Poulsard are very thin with low amounts of color -phenols and produces very <b>pale</b> colored red <b>wines,</b> even with extended maceration {{and can be used}} to produce white wines. Because of this, Poulsard is often blended with other red-skin varieties or used to produce lightly colored rosé wines. Additionally the grape is used to make blanc de noir white wines and sparkling cremants.|$|R
25|$|In the 18th century, {{the quality}} of roads in France became {{progressively}} better, which facilitated commerce in Burgundy wines. The first négociant houses of the region were established in the 1720s and 1730s. In the 18th century, Burgundy and Champagne were rivals for the lucrative Paris market, to which Champagne had earlier access. The two regions overlapped much in wine styles in this era, since Champagne was then primarily a producer of <b>pale</b> red still <b>wines</b> rather than of sparkling wines. A major work on Burgundy wines written by Claude Arnoux in 1728 deals with the famous red wines of Côte de Nuits and the Œil-de-Perdrix pink wines of Volnay, but only briefly mentions white wines.|$|R
5000|$|The Oeil de Perdrix {{style of}} wine is {{believed}} to have originated in the Middle Ages in Champagne region of France, prior to that region's development of the sparkling wine style that would take its name. During this period the Champenois were in competition with the Burgundy wine region for the favor of the Royal court and the lucrative Paris market. Red wine was particularly popular during this period and the northern location of the Champagne region had difficulties competing with the more fuller bodied wines of Burgundy. Winemakers in Aÿ, Marne began experimenting with creating a fuller bodied white wine from red wine grapes that the Champenois could uniquely market. Despite their best efforts, the Champenois did not have the technical expertise to make a truly [...] "white" [...] wine from red grapes, instead producing slightly <b>pale</b> colored <b>wines</b> which became known as Œil de Perdrix or the [...] "eye of the partridge". Centuries later, a Benedictine monk named Dom Pérignon would eventually perfect the method of white wine from red grape production that would be a vital component in the success of sparkling Champagne wine.|$|R
60|$|The {{last and}} loudest chorus had died away, and the Islanders were pouring forth their libation to their great enemy the Sun, when {{suddenly}} a vast obscurity {{spread over the}} glowing West. They looked at each other, and turned <b>pale,</b> and the <b>wine</b> from their trembling goblets fell useless on the shore. The women were too frightened to scream, and, {{for the first time}} in the Isle of Fantaisie, silence existed after sunset. They were encouraged when they observed that the darkness ceased at that point in the heavens which overlooked their coral rocks; and perceiving that their hitherto unsullied sky was pure, even at this moment of otherwise universal gloom, the men regained their colour, touched the goblets with their lips, further to reanimate themselves, and the women, now less discomposed, uttered loud shrieks.|$|R
50|$|Orange wine, {{although}} not commercially widely available, {{is produced in}} White River, South Africa, and by home wine makers. The taste is a light bodied <b>wine,</b> <b>pale</b> or golden in color, dry, thin in body, alcoholic. Outcome is reliant on the yeast used. Recipes {{are few and far}} between. Typically a home wine maker is receiving the bounty of their own orange tree or from a neighbors tree. The wine can be difficult to make because the fruit is very acidic, and the pH must be adjusted up. Further complications are encountered by a type of Penicillin bacteria that can stop the fermentation and spoil the wine. Great care must be taken to clean and sanitize the fruit. The remainder of the process is straightforward. The US government TTB has a standard for Orange Wine.|$|R
25|$|Grenache prefers hot, dry soils {{that are}} well drained but it {{relatively}} adaptable to all vineyard soil types. In southern France, Grenache thrives on schist and granite soils and has responded well to the stony soil of Châteauneuf-du-Pape with the area's galets roulés heat retaining stones. In Priorat, the crumbly schist soil of the region retain enough water to allow producers to avoid irrigation in the dry wine region. Vineyards with an overabundance of irrigation tend to produce <b>pale</b> colored <b>wines</b> with diluted flavors and excessive alcohol. The skin of Grenache is thin and lightly pigmented, making <b>wines</b> with <b>pale</b> color and low tannins. Older vines with low yields can increase the concentration of phenolic compounds and produced darker, more tannic wines such as {{those found in the}} Priorat region of Spain where yields are often around 5-6 hectoliters/hectare (less than half a ton per acre). Yield control is intimately connected with the resulting quality of wine with yields below 35 hl/ha (2 tons/acre), such as those practiced by many Châteauneuf-du-Pape estates, producing very different wines than those with yields closer to 50 hl/ha (5 tons/acre) which is the base yield for Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) wines labeled under the Côtes du Rhône designation. The strong wood canopy of Grenache makes the vine difficult to harvest with mechanical harvesters and pruning equipment and more labor-intensive to cultivate. In highly mechanized wine regions, such as Australia and California, this has contributed to a decline in the vine's popularity.|$|R
25|$|Grenache {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{varieties}} to be introduced to Australia in the 18th century and eventually became the country's most widely planted red wine grape variety until it was surpassed by Shiraz in the mid 1960s. Early Australian Grenache was a main component in the sweet fortified wines that was the lynchpin of the early Australian wine industry. In the 19th century, California wine growers prized the vine's ability to produce high yields and withstand heat and drought conditions. The grape was extensively planted throughout the hot San Joaquin Valley where it was mainly used as a blending component for <b>pale,</b> sweet jug <b>wines.</b> In the late 20th century, the Rhone Rangers movement brought attention to the production of premium varietal Grenache and Rhone style blends modeled after the Grenache dominate wines of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. In the early 20th century, Grenache {{was one of the}} first Vitis vinifera grapes to be successfully vinified during the early development of the Washington wine industry with a 1966 Yakima Valley rosé earning mention in wine historian Leon Adams treatise The Wines of America.|$|R
