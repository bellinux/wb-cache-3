5|$|The league drew ten member clubs {{from each}} of the two leagues for its inaugural season. The clubs {{selected}} to join from the Midland Combination were Barwell, Boldmere St Michaels, Bolehall Swifts, Pershore Town, Sandwell Borough, Shepshed Dynamo, Shifnal Town, Stapenhill, Stratford Town and West Midlands Police. Those selected from the West Midlands (Regional) League were Brierley Hill Town, Chasetown, Halesowen Harriers, Hinckley Athletic, Knypersley Victoria, Oldbury United, <b>Paget</b> Rangers, Rocester, Rushall Olympic and Willenhall Town. <b>Paget</b> Rangers won the first league championship by a margin of 12 points from Hinckley Athletic in the 1994–95 season, and gained promotion to the Southern League. The Alliance's status as a feeder to the Southern League was cemented when Armitage 90 were relegated in the opposite direction. Armitage went on to dominate the league in the 1995–96 season but disbanded midway through the season, with the result that their record was expunged from the table.|$|E
5|$|A salvage {{attempt was}} ordered by Secretary of State William <b>Paget</b> only {{days after the}} sinking, and Charles Brandon, the king's brother-in-law, took charge of {{practical}} details. The operation followed the standard procedure for raising ships in shallow waters: strong cables were attached to the sunken ship and fastened to two empty ships, or hulks. At low tide, the ropes were pulled taut with capstans. When the high tide came in, the hulks rose and with them the wreck. It would then be towed into shallower water and the procedure repeated until the whole ship could be raised completely.|$|E
50|$|The overall {{prevalence}} {{and severity of}} <b>Paget's</b> disease are decreasing; the cause for these changes is unclear. <b>Paget's</b> disease is rare in people less than 55 years of age, and the prevalence increases with age. Evidence from studies of autopsy results have demonstrated <b>Paget's</b> disease in about 3 percent of people older than 40 years of age. <b>Paget's</b> disease {{is more common in}} males than females. Rates of <b>Paget's</b> disease are about 50 percent higher in men than in women.|$|R
50|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>Paget's</b> disease varies considerably with geographic location. <b>Paget's</b> predominantly affects people of European descent, whereas people of African, Asian, or Indian descent are less commonly affected. <b>Paget's</b> disease is less common in Switzerland and Scandinavia {{than in the}} rest of Western Europe. <b>Paget's</b> disease is uncommon in the native populations of North and South America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. When an individual from these regions does develop <b>Paget's</b> disease, there is typically some European ancestry present.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Mammary <b>Paget's</b> {{disease and}} extramammary <b>Paget's</b> disease are {{neoplastic}} conditions, {{in which there}} is intraepithelial (usually intraepidermal) infiltration by neoplastic cells showing glandular differentiation. Mammary <b>Paget's</b> disease occurs exclusively on the nipple/areola complex from where it may spread to the surrounding skin. Case presentation We here describe a case of <b>Paget's</b> disease occurring on the thoracic wall site of a previous simple mastectomy, and also briefly summarise the most important aspects leading to a diagnosis of mammary <b>Paget's</b> disease. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of mammary <b>Paget's</b> disease occurring after mastectomy. The absence of the nipple/areola complex obviously raised some questions concerning whether it was mammary or extra-mammary <b>Paget's</b> disease, and how it could occur {{in the absence of the}} nipple/areola complex. </p...|$|R
5|$|In 1919, Compton {{was awarded}} {{one of the}} first two National Research Council Fellowships that allowed {{students}} to study abroad. He chose to go to Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory in England. Working with George <b>Paget</b> Thomson, the son of J. J. Thomson, Compton studied the scattering and absorption of gamma rays. He observed that the scattered rays were more easily absorbed than the original source. Compton was greatly impressed by the Cavendish scientists, especially Ernest Rutherford, Charles Galton Darwin and Arthur Eddington, and he ultimately named his second son after J. J. Thomson.|$|E
5|$|In October 1811, Aigle {{was sent}} to the Mediterranean where she and her crew raided the island of Elba before being asked to provide naval support during the {{invasion}} and occupation of Genoa. Refitted in January 1820, her square stern was replaced with a circular one, giving her a wider angle of fire and improved protection at the rear. Converted to a corvette in 1831, she returned to the Mediterranean under Lord <b>Paget.</b> From 1852, she became a coal hulk, then a receiving ship before being used as a target for torpedoes and broken up in 1870.|$|E

5|$|Re-rated as a 42-gun frigate in February 1817, Aigle {{underwent}} {{repairs and}} alterations at Woolwich from March 1817. In accordance with Surveyor of the Navy, Robert Seppings' designs, in January 1820, Aigle had her square transom removed and a circular stern fitted. This gave her improved {{protection in the}} rear and allowed a better field of fire. She was subsequently laid up then repaired and cut down to a 24-gun corvette between March and July 1831. Recommissioned in August 1841 under Lord Clarence <b>Paget,</b> she {{was sent to the}} Mediterranean.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} tinnitus and deafness in subjects with <b>Paget's</b> disease of bone. Materials and methods: One hundred and thirty-four subjects in total (77 with <b>Paget's</b> disease) were identified and audiologically examined. Subjects' experience of tinnitus was surveyed via a questionnaire and the results {{compared with those of}} age-matched controls. Results: Hearing loss in those with <b>Paget's</b> disease of bone was significantly worse than in controls. Hearing handicap was also much worse in the <b>Paget's</b> subjects. Sixty-one per cent of the <b>Paget's</b> subjects suffered from tinnitus, compared with 36 per cent of the controls.

40|$|<b>Paget’s</b> {{disease of}} the breast shows {{eczematous}} changes of the nipple-areolar complex, and characteristichistopathological feature of this condition {{is the presence of}} <b>Paget’s</b> cell in the keratinizing epithelium of the nipple, whichhas large and pale cytoplasm and round or oval shape with large nuclei and prominent nucleoli. <b>Paget’s</b> {{disease of the}} breastis limited to non-invasive or micro-invasive, and has a favorable prognosis. <b>Paget’s</b> disease with invasive lesions isclassified as Pagetoid cancer. We report six cases of <b>Paget’s</b> disease of the breast. Four cases were performed mastectomyand two cases were performed breast-conserving surgery. Four cases were performed sentinel lymph node biopsy. Skinbiopsy and cytology, and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were useful for the diagnosis of <b>Paget’s</b> disease. In particular,MRI detected the extent of intraductal lesions and identified otherwise disease. MRI for patients with <b>Paget’s</b> disease wasuseful to distinguish it from Pagetoid cancer and determine the extent of surgical treatment...|$|R
5|$|To claim her right, Mary Tudor began {{assembling}} {{her supporters}} in East Anglia and demanded to be recognised as queen by the Privy Council in London. When her letter arrived on 10 July 1553 during dinner, the Duchess of Suffolk, Jane's mother, and the Duchess of Northumberland broke into tears. Mary was gathering strength, and on 14 July the Duke marched to Cambridge with troops to capture her. As it came, {{he passed a}} tranquil week until he heard on 20 July that the Council in London had declared for Mary. On the orders of the Privy Council Northumberland himself now proclaimed Queen Mary at the market-place and awaited his arrest. His wife {{was still in the}} Tower, but was soon released. She tried to intercede personally for her imprisoned husband and five sons with Mary, who was staying outside London. However, five miles before reaching the court the Duchess was turned away on the Queen's orders. She then wrote a letter to her friend Lady <b>Paget,</b> the wife of William, Lord <b>Paget,</b> asking her to plead with the Queen's ladies for her husband's life. Her plea, if it went not unheard, was in vain, and the Duke of Northumberland was executed on 22 August 1553 on Tower Hill after having recanted his Protestant faith.|$|E

Former members include Nick Crandle and Jason James; both were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. Financial difficulties dictated the name change, which {{was followed by a}} change in music direction. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the pathogenesis of <b>Paget's</b> disease of the vulva and the breast remains limited. Current evidence supports the fact that angiogenesis {{plays an important role}} in the pathogenesis of several diseases. Therefore, we sought to define its role, as correlated with microvessel density, in <b>Paget's</b> disease of the vulva and the breast. Microvessels were analysed using anti-von Willebrand factor antibody in 105 cases of <b>Paget's</b> disease of the vulva and the breast comprising 71 cases of <b>Paget's</b> disease of the vulva, including 8 cases with invasive disease, and 34 cases of <b>Paget's</b> disease of the breast. The latter included 12 cases with DCIS, 5 cases with both DCIS and invasive carcinoma, and 6 with carcinoma alone. Eleven cases had no underlying tumour identified. Increased microvessel density was demonstrated in <b>Paget's</b> disease of the breast with DCIS and with carcinoma alone compared to <b>Paget's</b> disease of the breast alone, < 0. 08 and < 0. 013, respectively. There were no significant differences in microvessel density in the vulval cases. Neovascularisation is an important process in the development of <b>Paget's</b> disease of the breast. Other biological and molecular processes are more involved in the pathogenesis of <b>Paget's</b> disease of the vulva...|$|R

50|$|<b>Paget's</b> {{disease of}} bone (also termed osteitis deformans or ambiguously, just <b>Paget's</b> disease) {{is caused by}} the {{excessive}} breakdown and formation of bone, followed by disorganised bone remodelling.

At Cambridge, Nobel Prize in Physics laureates George <b>Paget</b> Thomson and William Lawrence Bragg wanted the government to take urgent action to acquire uranium ore. The main source of this was the Belgian Congo, and they were worried that it could fall into German hands. Unsure {{as to how to}} go about this, they spoke to Sir William Spens, the master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In April 1939, he approached Sir Kenneth Pickthorn, the local Member of Parliament, who took their concerns to the Secretary of the Committee for Imperial Defence, Major General Hastings Ismay.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Hyperprolactinemia is an {{uncommon}} cause of erectile dysfunction in men. <b>Paget's</b> {{disease of the}} skull is a relatively common disease. This case proposes a rare example of a causative link between the two and how treatment of the <b>Paget's</b> disease with bisphosphonates helped the patient regain erectile function. Case presentation A 67 -year-old man with <b>Paget's</b> disease of the skull presented with prostatitis, erectile dysfunction, and hyperprolactinemia. Radio-isotope scanning showed increased vascularity around the sphenoid bone. Treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates improved the active <b>Paget's</b> disease as indicated by declining alkaline phosphatase levels and the patient's erectile function while serum prolactin levels became normal and serum testosterone levels remained unchanged. Conclusion It is possible that hyperprolactinemia is unrecognised in other patients with <b>Paget's</b> disease of the skull. Normalizing elevated prolactin levels by using bisphosphonates in treating <b>Paget's</b> disease {{appears to be more}} appropriate than traditional treatment for hyperprolactinemia. </p...|$|R
