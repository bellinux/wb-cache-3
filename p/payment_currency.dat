40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis caused dramatic widening and elevated volatilities among basis spreads in cross currency {{as well as}} domestic interest rate markets. Furthermore, the wide spread use of cash collateral, especially in fixed income contracts, has made the effective funding cost of financial institutions for the trades {{significantly different from the}} Libor of the corresponding <b>payment</b> <b>currency.</b> Because of these market developments, the text-book style application of a market model of interest rates has now become inappropriate for financial firms; It cannot even reflect the exposures to these basis spreads in pricing, to say nothing of proper delta and vega (or kappa) hedges against their movements.

40|$|We {{examine the}} wealth {{effects of a}} {{comprehensive}} sample of UK bidders offering contingent payment, or earnout, as consideration for their acquisitions. We show that bidders using earnout generate significantly higher announcement and post-acquisition value gains than bidders using non-earnout currencies (such as cash, stock exchange, or mixed payments). We construct a logistic model to predict when it is optimal for a bidder to offer earnout. We show that bidders offering earnout optimally enjoy significantly higher announcement and post-acquisition gains than bidders offering non-earnout currencies, consistent with our model of {{the choice of the}} optimal method of payment. Overall, we provide robust evidence that earnout is an effective payment mechanism to mitigate valuation risk to acquirers, and also enhances acquirer value during the announcement and post-acquisition periods. Our paper contributes to the broader literature on how corporate acquirers use <b>payment</b> <b>currency</b> to manage information asymmetry and the attendant valuation risk...|$|E

40|$|The article’s main {{objective}} is to investigate the empirical link between the fiscal balance and the current account (i. e. the twin deficits phenomenon). The article focuses on transition economies which are according to their different characteristics divided into three major groups, i. e. Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), Southern and Eastern Europe (SEE) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). In fact, the inconsistency between public sector instability and currency overvaluations which led to current account balance deterioration was denoted {{as one of the}} key determinants of the balance of <b>payments</b> (<b>currency)</b> crisis seen in transition economies like Czech Republic (1997) and Russia (1998). Moreover, the importance of the so- called Horioka-Feldstein puzzle in transition economies is examined in order to draw some conclusions about the regions’ integration with international capital markets. For this purpose, pooled cross-sectional and time-series techniques are used to characterize the properties of current account variations across selected groups of transition economies in the 1990 - 2003 period. The empirical results suggest that high budget deficits in transition countries have signaled relatively low level of substitutability between private and public savings, implying a relatively high correlation between fiscal and external imbalances. Accordingly, special emphasis should be paid to the fiscal policy shift in these economies. Indeed, the main element of the economic policy reversal in transition countries should involve a substantial reduction of fiscal deficits in the future {{in order to reduce the}} probability of a balance of <b>payments</b> (<b>currency)</b> crisis. Finally, the article provides some evidence of the existence of the Horioka-Feldstein puzzle in transition economies. ...|$|R

40|$|Although wide {{variation}} {{in the type of}} consideration offered in corporate acquisitions is observed in practice, little is known about how bidders or targets choose the method of payment in takeovers. Further, several empirical studies report that shareholders of both targets and bidders earn higher returns in cash offers than in equity offers, but the reasons for this more favourable impact of cash offers have not been empirically established. This study attempts to fill these gaps in the literature by addressing three research questions:- 1) What factors determine the method of payment used by bidders in corporate acquisitions? 2) How do target shareholders choose between cash and equity when the bidder has offered "equity with a cash alternative" as the method of payment? 3) Why are bid premia higher in cash offers than in equity offers? In examining how bidders choose the method of payment this study in contrast to all previous studies, emphasises that there is a simultaneous and joint relationship between the method of payment and the choice of accounting policy. Accordingly, we adopt a simultaneous equations framework with payment method and accounting policy choices as endogenous variables. Our results show that payment method has a significant impact on accounting policy choice whereas the reciprocal effect is not significant. This result reflects the fact that UK accounting rules have eroded the distinction between merger and acquisition accounting which is more clearly observed in the US. We study how target shareholders choose the <b>payment</b> <b>currency</b> by examining how a choice is made between cash and equity when the bidder has offered "equity with a cash alternative" as the method of payment. We find that information about the opportunities for realising synergies in the acquisition have no influence on the choice of payment method by target shareholders. The choice is based primarily on the difference in value between the cash and equity offers. This is consistent with the theoretical predictions based on the efficient market hypothesis, that all publicly available information about a security can be reduced into a single index, namely the share price. We tested some of the popular explanations which have been advanced in the literature to explain the higher returns to cash offers. The capital gains tax compensation and the wealth redistribution hypotheses are rejected. Information asymmetry between managers and shareholders can explain some of the higher returns observed in cash offers. This is consistent with signalling models which predict that the use of equity to finance investments signals a belief by managers that their shares are overvalued...|$|E

In this article, we compare and contrast major currencies and their design features. We conclude that the designs of the two most widely used currencies in the world-the U.

40|$|Although {{many papers}} have already {{proposed}} empirical models of currency crises, {{the timing of}} such crises has received relatively little attention so far. Most papers use indeed a static specification and impose the same lag structure across all explanatory variables. This, by construction, prevents from specifically timing the crisis signals sent by the leading indicators. The objective here is to fill this gap by considering a set of dynamic discrete choice models. The first contribution is to identify how early in advance each explanatory variable sends a warning signal. Some indicators are found to signal {{a crisis in the}} very short run while others signal a crisis at more distant horizons. The second contribution is to show that state dependence matters, albeit mostly in the short run. The results have important implications for crisis prevention in terms of the timeliness and usefulness of the envisaged policy response.
