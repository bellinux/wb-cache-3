5|$|A series frontiersmen {{assemblies}} {{were held}} {{over several years}} across the Willamette Valley, with many on the French Prairie at Champoeg. The death of prominent settler Ewing Young on 9 February 1841, who left neither a will or had an heir in Oregon Country, left the future of his property uncertain. Jason Lee chaired the first meeting organised {{to discuss the matter}} on the 17th. He proposed the creation of an authority over the pioneers centered on a governor. French-Canadian settlers blocked the measure and instead a <b>probate</b> <b>judge</b> and a few other positions were appointed.|$|E

A hearing was held on September 23, 2011, at which time <b>Probate</b> <b>Judge</b> Alan King ruled that Dave Holloway had met the requirements for a legal presumption of death.

Loring, a Suffolk County <b>probate</b> <b>judge</b> who also served as U.S. commissioner of the Circuit Court in Massachusetts, ordered that Burns be forced back into slavery in Virginia, outraging abolitionists and the increasingly antislavery public in Massachusetts. Under the pressure of a public petition campaign spearheaded by William Lloyd Garrison, the legislature passed two Bills of Address, in 1855 and 1856, calling for Judge Loring {{to be removed from}} his state office, but in both cases Gardner declined to remove Loring. A third Bill of Address to remove Loring from office was later approved by Gardner's Republican successor, Nathaniel Prentice Banks.|$|E

Moore's attorneys continued to assert that the orders of the Alabama Supreme Court, which required Alabama's <b>probate</b> <b>judges</b> to deny same sex couples marriage licenses, were still in effect, and that Moore's January 6 Administrative Order was mischaracterized by the JIC, {{despite the fact that}} Moore stated in his January 6 order, [...] "...

500|$|Other court clerks in the U.S. {{have also}} refused to issue {{marriage}} licenses to same-sex couples. The probate judges of several counties in Alabama have stopped issuing marriage licenses to anyone. <b>Probate</b> <b>Judge</b> Nick Williams of Washington County, Alabama, said he stopped issuing licenses altogether to avoid discrimination and said, [...] "I completely disagree with the authority the Supreme Court has." [...] <b>Probate</b> <b>Judge</b> John Enslen of Elmore County, Alabama, said the federal government, not state probate offices, should be the entity issuing same-sex marriage licenses. Casey Davis (unrelated to Kim Davis), a clerk in Casey County, Kentucky, said, [...] "We've not tried to prevent same-sex marriages, we've only tried to exercise our First Amendment rights", adding that such applicants could apply in other counties.

[...] She suggested the possibility of other options {{to meet the needs}} of same-sex applicants, such as an online service. The ACLU has no plans for legal action against other court clerks or probate judges. National attention has not been on them as the ACLU brought no case against them, speculated University of Kentucky political science professor D.B. Riggle: [...] "The action in Rowan County may be in part due to the availability of plaintiffs for a case." ...|$|E
