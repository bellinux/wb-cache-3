40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} all {{procedures}} from the application {{for the public}} <b>procurement</b> <b>notice,</b> {{the implementation of the}} public procurement procedure and adaptation, to the granting of the certificate of occupancy for the building. The first part contains the issue of the Central Pharmacy associated with the bad repair of the rooms and its rich history going back to the 16 th century. The second part contains the entire chronology of the Law on public procurements (ZJN) since its first announcement in the year 1997. The first announcement of the Law on public procurements was due to the lacking experience of the preparers full of absurd provisions that from the EU. For this reason, the new Law on public procurements (ZJN- 1 A) was passed in the year 2000. Soon after its enactment, the same one showed many imperfections and it got many critical remarks from the domestic and foreign public, because it senselessly took over the regulations of the EU members. In 2004, the Amendments to the law ZJN- 1 A were passed, which contains a series of harmonisation of the ZJN- 1 A with the EU regulations on public procurements and the correction of imperfections in the ZJN- 1 A shown in practice. The third part contains the preparation of documentation and announcement of the public procurement. It represents the procedure of preparing a bid of one of the bidders and the selection of the most favourable bidder out of the bidders submitting the complete bid. The selection of the most favourable bidder was carried out according to the procedure of point marking of the handed bids. The bids which did not contain the complete documentation were eliminated. The last part describes the adaptation procedure, the problems which arose in this connection and the solving method. The comparison of the bid value and the final value of the carried out works shows that the final costs are higher than anticipated and that during the adaptation some unforeseen extra works have been arising. Usually the profit of the executor is hidden in these extra works...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the construction of}} the LOTED 2 ontology for the representation of European public <b>procurement</b> <b>notices.</b> LOTED 2 follows initiatives around the creation of linked data-compliant representations of information regarding tender notices in Europe, but focusing on placing such representations within their legal context. It is therefore considered a legal ontology, as it supports the identification of legal concepts and more generally, legal reasoning. Unlike many other legal ontologies however, LOTED 2 is designed to support the creation of Semantic Web applications. The methodology applied for building LOTED 2 therefore seeks to find a compromise between the accurate representation of legal concepts and the usability of the ontology as a knowledge model for Semantic Web applications, while creating connections to other relevant ontologies in the domain...|$|R

40|$|On November 15, 2009, the Chinese {{government}} promulgated the “Notification Regarding the Launch of National Indigenous Innovation Product Accreditation Work for 2009 ” (Notice 618), a {{new national}} accreditation program {{that is part of}} a bigger national innovation policy scheme. The new directive states that products can be accredited as “indigenous” if their commercial trademarks, patents, copyrights and non-patented technology and knowhow have originated in China. Further, Notice 618 explicitly specifies that “indigenous” products cannot be subject to foreign restrictions; the trademarks used must be registered in China first and cannot be constrained by any related foreign brand. After the accreditation procedure, “indigenous” products are added to a national catalogue that is used for the national government procurement market, i. e. “indigenous” products are given priority in government <b>procurement</b> projects. <b>Notice</b> 618 has attracted great attention from foreign investors in China immediately after its publication since their products would not qualify to obtain an “indigenous” product status. The immediate strong reaction of foreign investors against the implementation of Notice 618 has pressured the Chinese government to reconsider parts of its original indigenous innovation program and to submit a revised version. The content analysis in this paper revealed that changes made in the revised version of Notice 618 were able to be traced to the concerns raised by the foreign actor community as a whole at the meso level. Further, it can be assumed that foreign actors, specifically multinational corporations via their representative organizations, as a group {{had an impact on the}} national policy formation process in regard to the implementation of indigenous innovation in China. The findings of the content analysis have two implications for the Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ). First, the importance of the indigenous innovation program and its serious discussion among foreign actors provides enough information for the GIZ to consider its involvement on the topic. Second, the foreign actors currently contributing to the discussion of the topic are in high demand, i. e. indicating that the GIZ in China could play a potentially crucial role in mediating the concerns regarding the indigenous innovation to influential Chinese state actors. Moreover, GIZ could acquire a position within the cumulative pressure group of meso-level actors. As a major knowledge transfer agent, the GIZ with its research department for “Innovation and Technology” can offer its expertise within the discussion of indigenous innovation in China. Hence, one of the policy recommendations for GIZ is to contribute to the topic at the macro level by providing unbiased and objective advice to its current partners at the Executive summary V NDRC and the Research Office of the State Council. Another policy recommendation presented in this paper relates to the GIZ as an actor with vast experience in project implementation. GIZ could play a major role on the provincial and local level, assisting local governments and firms to implement the changes within the development of the indigenous innovation program...|$|R
