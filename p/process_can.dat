5|$|A {{stochastic}} or random <b>process</b> <b>can</b> {{be defined}} as a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used to index the random variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time. Each random variable in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or -dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time. A stochastic <b>process</b> <b>can</b> have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.|$|E
5|$|A {{stochastic}} <b>process</b> <b>can</b> {{be classified}} in different ways, for example, by its state space, its index set, or the dependence among the random variables. One common way of classification {{is by the}} cardinality of the index set and the state space.|$|E

5|$|When some {{component}} of a trait is heritable, selection alters the frequencies of the different alleles, or variants of the gene that produces the variants of the trait. Selection {{can be divided into}} three classes, {{on the basis of its}} effect on allele frequencies: directional, stabilizing, and purifying selection. Directional selection occurs when an allele has a greater fitness than others, so that it increases in frequency, gaining an increasing share in the population. This <b>process</b> <b>can</b> continue until the allele is fixed and the entire population shares the fitter phenotype. Far more common is stabilizing selection, which lowers the frequency of alleles that have a deleterious effect on the phenotype – that is, produce organisms of lower fitness. This <b>process</b> <b>can</b> continue until the allele is eliminated from the population. Purifying selection conserves functional genetic features, such as protein-coding genes or regulatory sequences, over time by selective pressure against deleterious variants.|$|E
5|$|All known {{isotopes}} of curium are radioactive {{and have}} a small critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. They predominantly emit α-particles, and the heat released in this <b>process</b> <b>can</b> serve as a heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, but this application is hindered by the scarcity, high cost, and radioactivity of curium isotopes. Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the 238Pu radionuclide for power sources in artificial pacemakers. It served as the α-source in the alpha particle X-ray spectrometers installed on several space probes, including the Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity Mars rovers and the Philae lander on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to analyze the composition {{and structure of the}} surface.|$|E

The specifications cover all the essential requirements of the manufacture of the Indian flag including sizes, dye colour, chromatic values, brightness, thread count and hemp cordage.

5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} somatic cells, the poly(A) tail of most mRNAs in the cytoplasm gradually get shorter, and mRNAs with shorter poly(A) tail are translated {{less and}} degraded sooner. However, {{it can take}} many hours before an mRNA is degraded. This deadenylation and degradation <b>process</b> <b>can</b> be accelerated by microRNAs complementary to the 3' untranslated region of an mRNA. In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tails are not degraded, but are instead stored without being translated. They are then activated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation after fertilisation, during egg activation.|$|E

5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on the phenotype, or {{the observable}} characteristics of an organism, but the genetic (heritable) basis of any phenotype {{that gives a}} reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this <b>process</b> <b>can</b> result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process {{in the evolution of}} a population. Natural selection can be contrasted with artificial selection, in which humans intentionally choose specific traits, whereas in natural selection there is no intentional choice.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} is {{a general}} process involving the motion of adatoms, molecules, and atomic clusters (adparticles) at solid material surfaces. The <b>process</b> <b>can</b> generally be thought of in terms of particles jumping between adjacent adsorption sites on a surface, as in figure 1. Just as in bulk diffusion, this motion is typically a thermally promoted process with rates increasing with increasing temperature. Many systems display diffusion behavior that deviates from the conventional model of nearest-neighbor jumps. Tunneling diffusion is a particularly interesting example of an unconventional mechanism wherein hydrogen {{has been shown to}} diffuse on clean metal surfaces via the quantum tunneling effect.|$|E

As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform.
