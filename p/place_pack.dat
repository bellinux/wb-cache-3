40|$|Broadcast {{treatments}} of Volak (Brodifacoum) applied at rates of approx. 20 lbs/acre gave 98 % control of voles when active ingredient levels were from 0. 005 % to 0. 0005 % in the bait. Of the two Rozol (Chlorophacinone) formulations tested, the French (Lipha) pelleted formulation {{appeared to be}} slightly better than what is currently being marketed in the USA. The Maki (Bromodialone) bait formulated in the same wax bait carrier as the Rozol-USA gave no better control than Rozol. Ramik-Brown (Diphacinone) {{did not appear to}} be as good as the other anticoagulants tested when applied either as a broad¬cast or as a hand placed bait. Plastic <b>place</b> <b>pack</b> Volak gave excellent control of voles when placed under shingles, old tires split in half, or cinder blocks. A new pelleted Zinc Phosphide formulation from Bell Labs gave excellent control of pine voles when applied as a hand placed or broadcast bait. Zinc Phosphide oat and corn, surface-coated, grain formulations did not perform well. In a separate experiment a laquard wheat formulation of Chlorophacinone performed well as a hand placed bait at 10 lbs/A under shingles...|$|E

5000|$|Prior to 2015, d-CON {{primarily}} {{used two}} active {{ingredients in the}} bait products. In the rat bait pellets, mouse bait pellets, <b>place</b> <b>packs,</b> and wedge baits, the active ingredient was brodifacoum, typically at 0.005% concentration.

[...] The use of brodifacoum was discontinued {{at the end of}} 2014 following an agreement with the EPA, and was replaced with less potent first-generation vitamin K anticoagulants such as diphacinone.|$|R

50|$|The column can {{be filled}} with random dumped packing (creating a random packed column) or with {{structured}} packing sections, which are arranged or stacked (creating a stacked packed column). In the column, liquids tend to wet {{the surface of the}} packing and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where mass transfer takes <b>place.</b> <b>Packing</b> material can be used instead of trays to improve separation in distillation columns. Packing offers the advantage of a lower pressure drop across the column (when compared to plates or trays), which is beneficial while operating under vacuum. Differently shaped packing materials have different surface areas and void space between the packing. Both of these factors affect packing performance.|$|R
