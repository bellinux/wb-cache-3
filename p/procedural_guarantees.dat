5|$|Black's view on {{due process}} drew from his reading of British history; to him, due process meant all persons {{were to be}} tried in {{accordance}} with the Bill of Rights' <b>procedural</b> <b>guarantees</b> and in accordance with constitutionally pursuant laws. Black advocated equal treatment by the government for all persons, regardless of wealth, age, or race. Black's view of due process was restrictive {{in the sense that it}} was premised on equal procedures; it did not extend to substantive due process. This was in accordance with Black's literalist views. Black did not tie procedural due process exclusively to the Bill of Rights, but he did tie it exclusively to the Bill of Rights combined with other explicit provisions of the Constitution.|$|E
500|$|Justice Black {{was well}} known for his {{rejection}} {{of the doctrine of}} substantive due process. Most Supreme Court Justices accepted the view that the due process clause encompassed not only <b>procedural</b> <b>guarantees,</b> but also [...] "fundamental fairness" [...] and fundamental rights. Thus, it was argued that due process included a [...] "substantive" [...] component in addition to its [...] "procedural" [...] component.|$|E

Despite this proscription of force, according to Flora Sapio it [...] "can easily occur because all basic <b>procedural</b> <b>guarantees</b> are removed as soon as shuanggui begins". Problems with Shuanggui, such as forced confessions, have occurred with inadequately-trained officials in areas controlled by local CDIs.|$|E

500|$|Chief Justice Earl Warren {{wrote the}} opinion of the Court, which spoke for eight justices in {{reversing}} the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Warren began by stating that the Court had never been [...] "previously called upon to decide whether the right of the accused to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor... is so fundamental [...] it is incorporated in the Due Process Clause". Because of the incorporation to states of other <b>procedural</b> <b>guarantees,</b> the [...] "right to offer the testimony of witnesses" [...] could be given no less weight. Warren wrote that it was critical to the ability to [...] "present a defense... defendant's version of the facts". This broad right was necessary to detail thoroughly, he wrote, because ignoring how the right would actually be applied would risk making the right to compel witnesses futile.|$|E
500|$|Human Rights Watch {{has stated}} that the [...] "re-education through labor" [...] system violates {{international}} law, specifically Article 9 (4.)of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which provides that [...] "Anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings before a court, in order that the court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his detention..." [...] Re-education through labor has also been criticized by numerous human rights groups for not offering <b>procedural</b> <b>guarantees</b> for the accused, and for being used to detain political dissidents, teachers, Chinese house church leaders, and Falun Gong practitioners. Furthermore, even though the law up until 2007 specified a maximum length of detainment of four years, at least one source mentions a [...] "retention for in-camp employment" [...] system that allowed authorities to keep detainees in the camps for longer than their official sentences.|$|E
500|$|Justice Harlan {{advocated}} a broad {{interpretation of the}} Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. He subscribed to the doctrine that the clause not only provided <b>procedural</b> <b>guarantees,</b> but also protected {{a wide range of}} fundamental rights, including those that were not specifically mentioned in the text of the Constitution. (See substantive due process.) However, as Justice Byron White noted in his dissenting opinion in Moore v. East Cleveland, [...] "no one was more sensitive than Mr. Justice Harlan to any suggestion that his approach to the Due Process Clause would lead to judges 'roaming at large in the constitutional field'." [...] Under Harlan's approach, judges would be limited in the Due Process area by [...] "respect for the teachings of history, solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms".|$|E
2500|$|Lochner's {{appeal was}} based on the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution: [...] "... nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." [...] In a series of cases {{starting}} with Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), the Supreme Court established that the Due Process Clause (found in both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments) is not only a <b>procedural</b> <b>guarantee,</b> but also a substantive limitation on the type of control that the government may exercise over individuals. Although that interpretation of the due process clause is a controversial one (see substantive due process), it had become firmly embedded in American jurisprudence {{by the end of the}} 19th century. Lochner argued that the right to contract freely was one of the rights encompassed by substantive due process.|$|R
40|$|Crawford v. Washington radically {{transformed}} the doctrine governing the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution. Before Crawford, a prosecutor could introduce against an accused {{evidence of a}} hearsay statement, even one made in contemplation {{that it would be}} used in prosecution, so long as the statement fit within a 2 ̆ 2 firmly rooted 2 ̆ 2 hearsay exception or the court otherwise determined that the statement was sufficiently reliable to warrant admissibility. Crawford recognized that the Clause is a <b>procedural</b> <b>guarantee,</b> governing the manner in which prosecution witnesses give their testimony. Therefore, a prosecutor may not introduce a statement that is testimonial in nature to prove the truth of a matter that it asserts unless the accused has, or has had, an opportunity to be confronted with the witness who made the statement...|$|R

2500|$|The Court {{first had}} {{to decide whether the}} prison inmates had a {{protected}} liberty interest in avoiding placement in OSP. [...] In the Sixth Circuit, Ohio had taken the position that they did not. [...] In the Supreme Court, however, Ohio conceded that they did. [...] Of its own force, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not guarantee that state prisoners will not be placed in more restrictive conditions of confinement. [...] However, individual state <b>procedural</b> <b>guarantees</b> may give rise to a protected liberty interest, as the Court had held in Sandin v. Conner, [...] [...] In Conner, the Court held that a protected liberty interest can arise only after examining the [...] "ordinary incidents of prison life". [...] Short periods of administrative segregation imposed as punishment for violating prison rules thus did not implicate a liberty interest, because inmates in the general population experience periods of lockdown, the degree of confinement in administrative segregation was not excessive, and the duration of the segregation period was not disruptive to the inmate's environment.|$|E

40|$|The Republic of Azerbaijan is a {{developing}} European country which regained its independence following {{the collapse of}} the USSR in 1991. As a young country Azerbaijan may face particular challenges with regard to human rights, above and beyond the more mainstream problems. However, it should be stressed that Azerbaijan has striven to improve the situation by enacting substantial legal and institutional reforms, as well as by becoming party to numerous international and regional treaties aimed at protection and promotion of human rights. According to the Constitution of Azerbaijan international treaties to which Azerbaijan is party become an indivisible part of the domestic legislature, and should have direct applicability. However, these treaties should be incorporated into domestic legislation for their better understanding and due application and such incorporation should be applied consistently and continuously, taking into consideration the jurisprudence of the relevant treaty bodies. The paper aims to illuminate the existing situation of ensuring the right to compensation as a <b>procedural</b> <b>guarantee</b> for legitimate deprivation of liberty for the purposes of criminal justice in the Republic of Azerbaijan and to determine the existing challenges.

40|$|Protection of the {{fundamental}} human rights and freedoms constitutes an essential function of the Constitutional Courts. This has been {{and continues to be}} the underlying reason for the establishment of these important mechanisms of the democratic state. However, the ways in which these fundamental human rights and freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitutional Courts vary from one country to another. In the majority of cases, this is realized not only through the abstract control of norms, or the incidental control (which is initiated by the courts of ordinary jurisdiction), but even through the individual complaints. On the other hand, the means and the area of constitutional control, exercised on the basis of individual complaints for the violation of fundamental human rights and freedoms, do not result to be the same ones. In this aspect, the Albanian case is presented as very particular and problematic. In pursuance of articles 42 and 131 /f of the Constitution, the individuals can be addressed to the Constitutional Court only in cases when they claim the violation of their right to due process of law. Actually, according to the case law of this court, this right has been understood and implemented only as a <b>procedural</b> <b>guarantee</b> in the context of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and not in the substantive context. Nevertheless, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Albania has made efforts to give a broader interpretation to the procedural context of the due process of law.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{analysis}} of meaning of Digest text D. 9. 2. 27. 14. An overview of different theories devoted to this text has been presented here with a critical review of their argumentation, and another possible way of interpretation has been proposed.

It is certain that neither Celsus nor Ulpian in the text D. 9. 2. 27. 14 doubted {{that in the case of}} weed pollution of soil, interdict quod vi aut clam can be given since all conditions for its implementation were fulfilled. With the interdict only the damage caused within a year can be claimed. For this reason this procedural means belongs to either the land owner or, if the land is leased, to the leaseholder. For the same reason along with the interdict, Aquilian claim is given, provided that only one of the two procedural means can be used. It belongs to both the land owner and the lease holder. It is given to the lease holder for the damage caused before the expiry of the lease, and to the land owner for the one caused later. Therefore, the lease holder who uses Aquilian claim has to provide a <b>procedural</b> <b>guarantee</b> that the land owner will not by any subsequent claim request compensation for damages on the same grounds. The claim is given to the lease holder on the grounds of yield owner and not on the grounds of land owner. The claim is given both to the owner and the lease holder not as a direct, but as actio in factum ex lege Aquilia. The reason for this cannot be determined with certainty, as it is possible that Ulpian quoted Celsus's opinion in a different context from the original one...|$|R
