The current study followed the efficacy of several types and isomers of alcohols on different bacterial species. Seven alcohols (ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, tert-butyl alcohol, and ethylene glycol) were used to evaluate their minimal inhibitory and bactericidal effects by microdilution method on bacteria that express many phenotypical characteristics: different cell-wall structure (Gram positive/negative bacteria), capsule production (Klebsiella pneumoniae), antibiotic resistance (MRSA vs MSSA) or high environmental adaptability (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Results: The best inhibitory effect was noticed for n-propyl, followed by iso-propyl, n-butyl, and iso-butyl alcohols with equal values. Ethylene glycol was the most inefficient alcohol on all bacteria. In K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, the bactericidal concentrations were higher than the inhibitory one, and to a level similar to that encountered for most of the Gram-positive bacteria. Among Gram-positive cocci, E. faecalis presented the lowest susceptibility to alcohols. Conclusions: All alcohols presented good effect on bacteria, even in low concentrations. Compared to ethanol as standard, there are better alternatives that can be used as antimicrobials, namely longer-chain <b>alcohols</b> such as <b>propyl</b> or butyric <b>alcohols</b> and their iso- isomers. Ethylene glycol should be avoided, due to its toxicity hazard and low antimicrobial efficacy.

Catalysts used were sulfuric acid at a concentration of 2 % of the oil/alcohol mixture in addition to hydrochloric acid and Amberlite IR- 120 cation exchange resin at the same molar concentration of H+ as in case of sulfuric acid. The reaction was fastest using sulfuric acid which has been then used to prepare esters of ricebran oil with methyl, ethyl, <b>propyl</b> and butyl <b>alcohols.</b> The four products have been evaluated as a fuel for diesel engines according to their fuel properties compared to regular diesel fuel. These properties include the calorific value, flash point, viscosity, pour point, cetane number, sulfur content and ASTM distillation characteristics.

The selection of the organic compounds was made in order to investigate the effect of the stereochemical structure and unsaturated bonds on the nickel electrocrystallization process. It was found that the presence of acetylenic compounds (butyne- 2 -diol 1, 4 and propyne- 2 -ol) in nickel plating baths leads to the predominance of high inhibited modes of crystal growth.

The incorporation of the monomer is carried out following two procedures. The first is the incorporation of the monomer by direct contact between the monomer and the organoclay. The second procedure involves a first step of impregnating the organoclay with <b>propyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and the subsequent incorporation of the monomer. Both procedures consist of the polymerization in situ via a free radical mechanism. PVA modified clays showed substantial improvements in thermal properties {{with respect to the}} organoclay (MMTHDTMA), corresponding to the greater stability to clay obtained by direct contact with the monomer, PVAMMT/HDTMA (VA). The clays prepared by both methods were incorporated into a HDPE matrix by melt blending, to study {{the effect of}} the method of preparing the organoclay with PVA in the polymer/clay compatibility and the effect on their thermal properties. The material characterization techniques were performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal analysis (TG, DTG, DSC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show a clear improvement in the HDPE thermal properties with the addition of organoclays containing PVA and allow a discussion of effect of preparation on compatibility and improved thermal properties.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that fermented food products possess a characteristic but pleasant flavor. The use of such foods, however, has been limited {{by the presence of}} ethanol. Thus the objective of this research was to investigate the possibility of producing non-alcoholic fermented juice concentrates. Three varieties of juices, Concord grape, apple, and blackberry, were ameliorated as needed and fermented to five to seven percent alcohol by volume. The fermented flavor was extracted with ethyl chloride and concentrated by distillation. These extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography using two different column temperatures. Low column temperature was 100 °C while high column temperature was 170 °C. Four peaks were found to contribute from 93 to 97 percent of the flavor compounds chromatographically separated from the three juices at low temperature. By use of the enrichment technique, these peaks appeared to be <b>propyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> isobutyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, and a mixture of isoamyl and active amyl alcohol. At high temperature separation, four peaks were observed to comprise 56 to 64 percent of the flavor components fractionated. These four peaks appeared to be a mixture of acetic acid and ethyl octanoate, caproic acid, phenethyl alcohol and caprylic acid. Other components were tentatively identified to be acetone, ethyl acetate, ethanol, n-amyl alcohol, ethyl hexanoate, n-hexanol, propionic acid, 2, 3 -butylene glycole, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, diethyl succinate, 4 -butyrolactone, valeric acid and capric acid. Freeze drying and a combined method of distillation and freeze centrifugation were the two methods employed to remove ethanol and water from the fermented juices. A fivefold concentration of the original juices was obtained. From 91 to 95 percent of the alcohol and 80 percent of the water were removed from the juices by freeze drying while the combined technique removed only 79 percent of the ethanol and 80 percent of the water. Total acids, color and total soluble solids were not affected by the freeze drying procedure whereas the combined technique for removal of the alcohol resulted in some loss of these constituents. The fermented dealcoholized juices were analyzed by gas chromatography using only high temperature columns. These data indicate that dealcoholization resulted in a decrease in the peak heights of the first ten peaks to be separated. The remainder of the peaks generally showed an increase although a few exceptions were noted. The dealcoholized fermented juice concentrates were reconstituted and evaluated by a flavor panel. The panel data indicated that the rank order of preference for the three juices was blackberry, apple and Concord grape. The flavor panel also preferred the juices served at the higher levels of sweetness. The total average panel score for these three juices was observed to be about a neutral rating of "neither like nor dislike"...|$|E
