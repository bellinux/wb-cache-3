40|$|A new {{scheme of}} {{personal}} income tax reform would eliminate the inefficiencies arising from differences in the tax treatment of investments in intangible human capital {{and other types of}} capital formation. It also would offset the exacerbation of those distortions caused by progressive taxation, without requiring abandonment of the latter principle. The proposed incremental reform of the {{personal income tax}} regime would permit full deductibility of private costs of education and training, but defer the exercise of the deduction credits. The novel instrument for achieving these objectives is an individually held, non- transferable asset: an untaxed, interest-bearing educational (expense) deduction account [...] christened the “UIBEDA,” and pronounced: “we- bedda. ” Under plausibly realistic assumptions about the time profile of education-associated earnings differentials, and the <b>progressiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> rate schedules, it is feasible for the Treasury adopting such a scheme to satisfy an intertemporal balanced budget constraint, while in effect acting as a financial intermediary in the market for human capital investments. The UIBEDA scheme facilitates shifting from direct educational subsidies to the use of publicly subsidized student loans, and also can be readily extended to promote selective immigration of workers who have incurred indebtedness for human capital investments abroad. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{commonly}} used policy approach to subsidize the private provision of public goods by granting agents deductions with respect to their income or corporate tax burden. Design/methodology/approach – In the framework of a microeconomic representative agent model the commonly used policy approach to subsidize donations by granting agents deductions with respect to their income tax burden is examined. The paper especially considers that most income tax schemes are progressive and deductibility is limited. After pointing to the problems arising from these specific properties of tax-refund schemes the paper turns towards the effects that such a tax-refund scheme has with respect to donations on the one hand and welfare on the other hand. Findings – Findings shows that the effects of the commonly practiced methods of supporting donations depend crucially on the specific properties of the tax scheme and preferences of agents. While Pareto-improvements and even Pareto-efficiency can result from the implementation of such a scheme, it is also conceivable that some agents perceive a utility reduction. Research limitations/implications – The analysis builds on a static approach although taxation also exerts important dynamic effects. These effects have been neglected in the current paper as the interaction of taxation and preferences is already quite complex. However, they should be considered in future research. Practical implications – Owing to the dependency of welfare effects on the tariff structure, income tax reforms as they are planned in many countries might not only induce a reduction in donations, but might as a result also alter the induced welfare effects. Originality/value – The paper shows that the generally applied tax-refund schemes constitute no effective means to induce optimal donation levels. Implications depend crucially on, e. g. deductibility ceilings and <b>progressiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> rates. Charitable donations, Government policy...|$|E

40|$|The {{personal}} income tax is not harmonised in the European Union that’s why there are different systems of the {{personal income}} tax which reflects in different nominal tax rates, different allowances, deductions and tax credits. The comparisons based on nominal tax rates predicate the real rate of taxation insufficiently because of these differences. More objective way how to measure the <b>tax</b> circumstances <b>of</b> the taxpayers in individual countries are relative indicators such as the <b>tax</b> incidence <b>of</b> the taxpayer with an average wage, the calculation <b>of</b> an effective <b>tax</b> rate or measuring the <b>tax</b> <b>progressiveness.</b> The index <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> <b>progressiveness</b> {{which is based on}} the effective tax rate predicates the effective tax burden and the relationship between the change of the income and the tax burden.

40|$|In {{exploring}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> policy on labor-market performance, the paper first investigates how tax reform impacts labor supply and equilibrium unemployment in representative agent models. The impact <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> policy on labor market performance depends importantly on various other labor-market institutions, such as minimum wage laws, wage bargaining, and unemployment benefits. In non-competitive labor markets, employment declines if a higher tax burden makes the outside option (i. e. unemployment) r elatively more attractive. Marginal tax rates typically di"er substantially across individuals. To explore the impact <b>of</b> specific <b>tax</b> policies, therefore, the paper relies on an applied {{general equilibrium model}} to investigate the consequences <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> reform with heterogeneous households. The model simulations reveal several trade-o"s between various objectives, such as cutting unemployment, stimulating the participation of secondary workers into the labor force, raising {{the quality and quantity}} of labor supply, and establishing an equitable income distribution. The paper also analyses how efficiency considerations a"ect the optimal <b>progressiveness</b> <b>of</b> labor income <b>taxes.</b> Finally, the optimal progression of the labor income tax is investigated in the presence of search unemployment, heterogeneous households and distributional concerns. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{identifies}} fiscal policies, specifically tax and expenditure policies, {{that would}} contribute to reducing horizontal (or group) inequalities (HIs). It reviews how to identify relevant groups {{and how best to}} measure inequalities between them – both in income and in other dimensions. It notes the lack of adequate socioeconomic data broken down according to ethno-cultural categories in many countries, and suggests ways in which existing data may be used instead. It then looks firstly at taxation policy, and identifies changes to such policy that {{would contribute to}} reducing HIs. These include improving the <b>progressiveness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> structure; tailoring taxes to group behaviour; altering the regional balance of taxation and revenue distribution; and raising the amount <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> collected to provide revenue for HI-reducing expenditures. Turning to expenditure policies, it notes that improvements in HI can be brought about through reallocation in the production, operation and consumption of publicly funded services. Policies are outlined for each category. These include: affirmative action policies changing group participation in government contracts for the construction of public facilities and in employment in the public sector; a focus on pro-poor public goods and those that favour particular groups; locating a higher proportion of public goods in regions where poor groups are concentrated; and appropriately designed transfer payments. The paper then provides an example, by reviewing the ways in which fiscal policies were used to reduce HIs in Malaysia. It concludes by setting out the processes by which the policies proposed could be put into practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to analyse tax reform {{measures}} to secure the tax revenue base, in particular the personal income <b>tax</b> structure <b>of</b> South Africa. The main objectives are: firstly, to identify personal income tax reform interventions so as to align the personal income tax structure in South Africa with international best practices. Secondly, the impact <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> reforms on revenue collection, given optimal economic growth levels, is determined. Thirdly, to determine the best tax reform scenario which could minimise the individual tax burden and maximise its efficiency. Lastly, the impact <b>of</b> the suggested <b>tax</b> reforms on fairness as a principle <b>of</b> a good <b>tax</b> system is evaluated. A static micro-simulation model is developed from survey data and used to simulate the proposed tax reforms. Different tax reforms were selected from a study <b>of</b> international <b>tax</b> reform trends and an analysis of the South African personal income tax structure. The literature provides clear margins for the structuring <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> bands and threshold margins. Tax elasticities are estimated in order to explain the methodology for determining the impact <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> reforms. These elasticities include the elasticities for determining the <b>progressiveness</b> <b>of</b> the PIT structure, determining the deadweight loss (tax efficiency) and also to determine the optimal levels <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> and economic growth and revenue maximisation. The different tax reform scenarios take the economy closer to or further away from optimum growth and optimum revenue. The results show that as far as marginal rates are concerned, a lowering in rates to levels on par with South Africa’s peers offers potential for improved levels of efficiency with the tax burden equal to or even below the optimal tax ratio from an economic growth point of view. Although such a ratio is below the optimal revenue ratio the results suggest that the loss in revenue could be minimised over time through a resultant increase in productivity and economic growth. By adjusting the non-taxable thresholds and taxable income bands according to the algorithm defined in the best practice scenario, more taxpayers will be included into the tax net but with a net decrease in tax liability. As a result the tax/GDP level also declines to a level below the optimal growth level but tax efficiency increases. The resultant loss in revenue will have to be recouped through increases in other than individual income taxes but improved levels <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> morality because <b>of</b> the lower margins for each tax band and increased productivity might also contribute to increased revenue performance. The tax structure is also more progressive which contributes towards the “fairness” <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> regime. Regarding tax expenditure reforms, the analysis shows that medical tax credits offer a more equitable form of relief than medical deductions which substantiate this kind of reform as already implemented by government and which is to be fully phased in over the next couple <b>of</b> years. <b>Tax</b> liability is slightly lower in the case of medical credits compared to medical deductions but the difference is only marginal as far as net revenue and optimal growth and efficiency is concerned. However, a medical credit which increases disposable income {{at the lower end of}} the scale and discriminates against higher income groups also improves <b>progressiveness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> regime and therefore the fairness thereof accordingly. Finally, the demographic impact of the suggested reforms also shows some important trends. Better education improves skills levels which seems to be positively correlated to taxable income levels. As far as age is concerned, the analysis shows that a substantial number of taxpayers in the categories below the age of 24 and above 65 fall within the lower taxable income groups. Those are also the most vulnerable groups from a subsistence point <b>of</b> view. Thus, <b>tax</b> reform that specifically improves their levels of disposable income should be prioritised in order to address equity and fairness as objectives for a “good” tax structure.

First, later adopters are not necessarily being progressive compared to earlier adopters even though states are more likely to do an action as time goes.

The models try to depict outcomes for the EMU countries. In the one-country model we obtain a priori results. In {{the case of the}} two-country model, we calculate the solution by using realistic estimates for the parameters. In the one-country model progressive taxation tends to stabilise output in the cases <b>of</b> demand and <b>tax</b> shocks. In the case of a supply shock, tax progressiveness tends to stabilise output if taxes are fully indexed. If they are not, the outcome depends especially {{on the size of the}} demand effect <b>of</b> <b>taxes.</b> Progressive taxation stabilises prices definitely only in the case <b>of</b> a <b>tax</b> shock. In the cases of demand and supply shocks, the outcome depends in opposite ways on the relative strengths of the demand and supply effects <b>of</b> <b>taxes.</b> In the two-country model progressive taxation tends to increase output stability in both countries in the face of a demand shock. Progressiveness stabilises prices if wages and prices react only modestly to changes in taxes, but destabilises them when these reactions are strong. In the case <b>of</b> a <b>tax</b> shock, progressive taxation tends to stabilise the output and prices of both countries. In the case of a supply shock, output and prices are not very sensitive to progressiveness. When tax indexation is low, progressiveness can, however, destabilise the output of the country where the shock originates. All in all, progressive taxation tends to stabilise output or has a neutral effect in most cases. The effects on price stabilisation are, however, more controversial.
