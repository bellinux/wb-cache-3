The aim of this study is to find out their influence on the emergence rate of Douglas fir. We have tested one specific seed lot originated from the Czech Republic subject to the following variants of pre-sowing treatment: soaking for 48 hours, stratification without a medium for 21 days and for 30 days after 48 hours of soaking and stratification for 30 days with a medium.

40|$|A {{greenhouse}} {{experiment was}} conducted to {{study the effects of}} abrasion, sulphuric acid, boiling water, cold stratification and seed exudate treatments on the germination of 10 Calligonum species. That are dominant shrubs used for restoration of desert vegetation in mobile sand dunes and stabilized sand fields in the northern desert of China. Little is known about their germination characteristics. In August–September 1998, seeds of Calligonum were collected and were treated by five <b>pre-sowing</b> <b>treatments</b> before the germination experiments. The results show that the germination response of seeds to the different pretreatments was more or less similar for all 10 Calligonum species. The germination percent of seed from the 10 species was lowest for exudate treatments and highest for abrasion treatments. The abrasion, sulphuric acid and cold stratification treatments significantly promoted overall germination. Compared with the control, the exudate treatment significantly hampered germination, rate of germination and bolstered dormancy for almost all species. The cold stratification treatment can break the dormancy of viable Calligonum seeds and increase the germination, but it has lethal effect on viable seeds probably as well as the boiling water treatments. Almost all germination parameters showed significant difference between the <b>pre-sowing</b> <b>treatments</b> for all 10 Calligonum species.

Although similar losses in germination capacity and decreases in radicle emergence rates occurred under both ageing conditions, differences {{with respect to the}} physiology of ageing were highlighted by changes in seedling growth and seed leakage. For example, increases in seed leakage observed during storage at 1 5 % SMC were not found at 100 % RH. Longer hydration treatments (either 24 h at l 5 °C in water or 20 h at 20 °C in - 0. 37 MPa PEG solution, followed by drying) improved the vigour of unaged seeds, but treated material deteriorated rapidly in storage compared to untreated controls. In contrast short hydration treatments (2 h at 25 ° C followed by drying) offered some protection of germinability during subsequent storage but did not affect the vigour of unaged seeds. When seeds were treated after storage, longer hydration periods were effective in producing substantial invigoration of viable deteriorated seeds (measured by evaluating T 50 or seedling growth) compared to little or no improvement by short hydration treatments. These results support earlier suggestions from work on tomato seeds that losses in seed vigour and viability are not necessarily a continuum of the same deteriorative sequence. The mechanisms of protection of germinability by short hydration treatments were not clear. Small decreases in T 50 's of unaged or aged seeds {{as a result of these}} treatments were due to leakage of germination inhibitory substances. However, the rapid germination of unaged and improved responses from aged seeds caused by longer hydration treatments suggested advances in germination processes and repair activity under these conditions. This aspect was pursued in further detail by studying changes in the hydrolytic metabolism of wheat seeds using the 20 h PEG treatment. Although the starchy endosperm of treated seeds showed some indications of protein degradation, there were no changes in proteolytic activity (determined as 'Azocoll' hydrolysing activity at pH 6. 8) as a result of ageing or <b>pre-sowing</b> <b>treatment</b> after storage. However, there were some indications of loss of control over proteolytic activity in seeds subjected to treatment before storage. Severe damage to m embrane permeability in these seeds appears to be a post-mortem event as this was only found in samples showing drastic losses in seed germinability. <b>Pre-sowing</b> <b>treatment</b> caused a buildup of germinative a-amylase activity in unaged but not in aged seeds, although both showed similar radicle emergence rates. Quick resumption of a-amylase production during subsequent imbibition by treated seeds, irrespective of ageing, suggests that components involved in de novo enzyme synthesis are tolerant to desiccation in wheat seeds. Increased a-amylase activity in treated seeds or its m aintenance during subsequent storage, surprisingly did not cause damage to stored starch. There was no relationship between increased a-amylase activity and early radicle emergence. The ageing-induced delay in germinative a-amylase production appeared to be due to delayed gibberellin synthesis by the aged embryo. <b>Pre-sowing</b> <b>treatment</b> of seeds after storage effectively decreased the lag period for enzyme production in deteriorated seeds. Ageing effects on aleurone were characterised by investigating changes in the responsiveness of embryoless half seeds to gibberellic acid with respect to a-amylase production in vitro. Ageing of seeds caused a significant reduction in aleurone enzyme production. These changes were at least in part, reversed by <b>pre-sowing</b> <b>treatment</b> of aged seeds.

30|$|The {{nature of}} overall {{dynamics}} of lectin {{activity in the}} control and infected plants was the same, but the maximum values of lectin activity were substantially higher under the stress conditions, indicating induction of lectin activity by pathogen. <b>Pre-sowing</b> <b>treatment</b> of winter wheat seeds with nonionic solution of metal nanoparticles (zinc, silver, iron, manganese, and copper) caused the increase of LA, even more evident in the infected plants. Same trend was also observed in the non-treated variants, which might indicate the induction of endogenous defense reactions to pathogen infection in wheat seedlings. Winter wheat seedlings obtained from the seeds treated with solution of copper nanoparticles demonstrated similar dynamics of lectin activity to that in control, but five to ten times higher than LA values in control. However, in variants with plant infection, the level of lectin activity was the lowest, due to the fungicide properties of copper.|$|E
40|$|Apre-sowing {{treatment}} {{was applied to}} black cumin (Nigella sativa L.) seeds, which were surface-sterilized and soaked for 5, 10 or 15 h in 10 – 6, 10 – 5, or 10 – 4 Maqueous solution of gibberellic acid (GA). The potted plants were then analysed at 50, 70 and 90 days after sowing for leaf chlorophyll (Chl) content, stomatal conductance (gs), carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity, nitrate reductase (NR) activity, total protein content, net photosynthetic rate (PN), capsule number and seed yield at harvest (130 days after sowing). All these parameters {{were found to be}} appreciably enhanced by the hormone treatment. The most prominent results were obtained with 10 – 5 M GA following a <b>pre-sowing</b> <b>treatment</b> for 10 h, in which case the values for PN, CAand NR activity, and seed yield were elevated by 44, 40, 30 and 40 % respectively over the control at the 70 day stage...|$|E
30|$|Churilov [18] has {{demonstrated}} that ultra disperse metal powder had stimulated growth and development of medicinal plants. In addition, usage of metal nanopowders, comparing to controls, had increased the content of biologically active substances like ascorbic acid, carotene, and carbohydrates in these plants. Thus, it can be assumed that <b>pre-sowing</b> seed <b>treatment</b> with nonionic solutions of biogenic metal nanoparticles will influence the formation of plant defense reactions under the action of either abiotic or biotic stressor.|$|R

Thus, a seed treatment with Ag and Cu nanoparticles has triggered similar but slightly earlier changes in the TBARS content in seedlings of the Myronivska 808 variety (both infected and the controls (uninfected) variants) to those observed in the variant with the P. herpotrichoides infection but {{without the use of}} nanoparticles.|$|R
40|$|Nickel {{toxicity}} affects many metabolic {{facets of}} plants and induces anatomical and morphological changes resulting in reduced growth and productivity. To overcome the damaging effects of nickel (Ni) stress, different strategies of the application of nutrients with plant hormones are being adopted. The present study was carried out with an aim {{to find out whether}} pre-sowing seed application of calcium chloride and gibberellic acid (GA 3) could alleviate the detrimental effects of nickel toxicity on metabolism of wheat plant (TriticumaestivumL.) cv. Samma. The <b>pre-sowing</b> seed <b>treatment</b> of Ni (50 mM) decreased growth characteristics (plant height, root length, fresh and dry weight) and physiological characteristics (chlorophyll content and carbonic anhydrase). However, Malondialdehyde content and electrolyte leakage were recorded maximum in plants raised from seed soaked with Ni alone. Moreover, all the growth parameters and physiological attributed (Chlorophyll content, proline content, carbonic anhydrase, peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase enhanced, in the plants developed from the seeds soaked with GA 3 (10 - 6 M) in combination with Ca 2 +(40 mM) and Ni (50 mM). The present study showed that <b>pre-sowing</b> seed <b>treatment</b> of GA 3 with Ca 2 + was more capable in mitigation of adverse effect of Ni toxicity by improving the antioxidant system...|$|R
