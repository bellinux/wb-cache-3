Gene disruption experiments suggested that hrdB is essential in S. coelicolor A 3 (2) but showed that hrdC and hrdD mutants are viable and are apparently unaffected in differentiation, gross morphology, and antibiotic production. S 1 nuclease mapping showed that hrdB and hrdD, but not hrdC, were transcribed in liquid culture. The most upstream of two hrdD promoters is internal to an open reading frame (ORF X) on the opposite strand. The predicted product of this gene is homologous to the <b>phosphinothricin</b> <b>acetyltransferases</b> of Streptomyces hygroscopicus and Streptomyces viridochromogenes.

40|$|A {{reproducible}} {{system for}} the generation of fertile, transgenic maize plants has been developed. Cells from embryogenic maize suspension cultures were transformed with the bacterial gene bar using microprojectile bombardment. Transformed calli were selected from the suspension cultures using the herbicide bialaphos. Integration of bar and activity of the enzyme <b>phosphinothricin</b> <b>acetyltransferase</b> (PAT) encoded by bar were confirmed in all bialaphos-resistant callus lines. Fertile transformed maize plants (R 0) were regenerated, and of 53 progeny (R 1) tested, 29 had PAT activity. All PAT-positive progeny analyzed contained bar. Localized application of herbicide to leaves of bar-transformed R 0 and R 1 plants resulted in no necrosis, confirming functional activity of PAT in the transgenic plants. Cotransformation experiments were performed using a mixture of two plasmids, one encoding PAT and one containing the nonselected gene encoding [beta]-glucuronidase.

40|$|Cell-autonomous genes {{have been}} used to monitor the {{excision}} of both endogenous transposons in maize and Antirrhinum, and transposons introduced into transgenic plants. In tobacco and Arabidopsis, the streptomycin phosphotransferase (SPT) gene reveals somatic excision of the maize transposon Activator (Ac) as green sectors on a white background in cotyledons of seedlings germinated in the presence of streptomycin. Cotyledons of tomato seedlings germinated on streptomycin-containing medium do not bleach, suggesting that a different assay for transposon excision in tomato is desirable. We have tested the use of the spectinomycin resistance (SPEC) gene (aadA) and a Basta resistance (BAR) gene (<b>phosphinothricin</b> <b>acetyltransferase,</b> or PAT) for monitoring somatic excision of Ac in tobacco and tomato. Both genetic and molecular studies demonstrate that genotypically variegated individuals that carry clones of cells from which Ac or Ds have excised from either SPEC or BAR genes, can be phenotypically completely resistant to the corresponding antibiotic. This demonstrates that these genes act non-cell-autonomously, in contrast to the SPT gene in tobacco. Possible reasons for this difference are discussed...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel and reproducible system for recovery of fertile transgenic maize (Zea mays L.) plants. The transformation was performed using microprojectile bombardment of cultured shoot apices of maize with a plasmid carrying two linked genes, the Streptomyces hygroscopicus <b>phosphinothricin</b> <b>acetyltransferase</b> gene (bar) and the potato proteinase inhibitor II gene, either alone or in combination with another plasmid containing the 5 [prime] region of the rice actin 1 gene fused to the Escherichia coli [beta]-glucuronidase gene (gus). Bombarded shoot apices were subsequently multiplied and selected under 3 to 5 mg/L glufosinate ammonium. Co-transformation frequency was 100 % (146 / 146) for linked genes and 80 % (41 / 51) for unlinked genes. Co-expression frequency of the bar and gus genes was 57 % (29 / 51). The co-integration, co-inheritance, and co-expression of bar, the potato proteinase inhibitor II gene, and gus in transgenic R 0, R 1, and R 2 plants were confirmed.

40|$|Particle {{bombardment}} and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation are two popular methods {{currently used}} for producing transgenic maize. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation {{is expected to}} produce transformants car-rying fewer copies of the transgene and a more predictable pattern of integration. These putative advantages, however, tradeoff with transformation efficiency in maize when a standard binary vector transformation system is used. Using Southern, northern, real-time PCR, and real-time RT-PCR techniques, we compared transgene copy numbers and RNA expression levels in R 1 and R 2 generations of transgenic maize events generated using the above two gene delivery methods. Our results demonstrated that the Agrobacterium-derived maize transfor-mants have lower transgene copies, and higher and more stable gene expression than their bombardment-derived counterparts. In addition, we showed that more than 70 % of transgenic events produced from Agrobacterium-mediated transformation contained various lengths of the bacterial plasmid backbone DNA sequence, indicating that the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was not as precise as previously perceived, using the current binary vector system.

DNA delivery parameters were optimized based on transient expression of R and C 1 maize anthocyanin regulatory elements in scutellar cells. The protocol for obtaining transgenic plants consists of the delivery of the bar gene to immature zygotic embryos and the imposition of bialaphos selection pressure at various stages during culture, from induction of somatic embryogenesis to rooting of regenerated plantlets. One in about every 350 embryos produced embryogenic tissues that survived bialaphos treatment; six transformed callus lines were obtained from three of the eight sorghum cultivars used in this research. Transgenic (T 0) plants were obtained from cultivar P 898012 (two independent transformation events). The presence of the bar and uidA genes in the T 0 plants was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA. <b>Phosphinothricin</b> <b>acetyltransferase</b> activity was detected in extracts of the T 0 plants.

40|$|Phosphinothricin (PPT) is {{the active}} {{component}} {{of a family of}} environmentally safe, nonselective herbicides. Resistance to PPT in transgenic crops has been reported by nuclear expression of a bar transgene encoding <b>phosphinothricin</b> <b>acetyltransferase,</b> a detoxifying enzyme. We report here expression of a bacterial bar gene (b-bar 1) in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Petit Havana) plastids that confers field-level tolerance to Liberty, an herbicide containing PPT. We also describe a second bacterial bar gene (b-bar 2) and a codon-optimized synthetic bar (s-bar) gene with significantly elevated levels of expression in plastids (> 7 % of total soluble cellular protein). Although these genes are expressed at a high level, direct selection thus far did not yield transplastomic clones, indicating that subcellular localization rather than the absolute amount of the enzyme is critical for direct selection of transgenic clones. The codon-modified s-bar gene is poorly expressed in Escherichia coli, a common enteric bacterium, due to differences in codon use. We propose to use codon usage differences as a precautionary measure to prevent expression of marker genes in the unlikely event of horizontal gene transfer from plastids to bacteria.

Activity of <b>phosphinothricin</b> <b>acetyltransferase</b> (PAT; gene, bar; one cysteine) expressed under control of the TR 1 ' or 35 S promoter was not similarly affected, thus excluding a redox modulation of transcription as the mechanism of NPTII activation by dithiothreitol. Western-blot analyses showed an increase in the amount of protein in response to dithiothreitol, whereas neither the steady-state level of NPTII mRNA nor the specific activity of the purified enzyme was affected. The same type of modulation was observed for transiently expressed beta-glucuronidase (nine cysteines) produced from a fusion with the 35 S promoter, {{with or without a}} signal peptide. Limitation of cotranslational and/or early posttranslational steps by excessively oxidizing sulfhydryl/disulfide redox potentials is postulated to explain the low net accumulation of cysteine-rich proteins of bacterial origin (i. e., NPTII and beta-glucuronidase) when expressed in plant protoplasts, and the marked increase in such proteins in response to externally added dithiothreito...|$|E

Florida and L 88 - 31 via particle bombardment, using the <b>phosphinothricin</b> <b>acetyltransferase</b> (pat) gene as a selectable marker. All six independent transgenic wheat lines recovered expressed the GST- 27 gene. T 1 progeny of these wheat lines were germinated on solid medium containing the chloroacetanilide herbicide alachlor, and tolerance to this herbicide was correlated with GST- 27 expression levels. In glasshouse sprays, homozygous T 2 plants were resistant not only to alachlor but also to the chloroacetanilide herbicide dimethenamid and the thiocarbamate herbicide EPTC. These additional GST- 27 activities, demonstrated via over-expression in a heterologous host, have not been described previously. T 2 plants showed no enhanced tolerance to the herbicides atrazine (an s-triazine) or oxyfluorfen (a diphenyl ether). In further experiments, T 2 wheat plants were recovered from immature transgenic scutella cultured on medium containing 100 mg/l alachlor, a concentration which killed null segregant and wild-type scutella.

We sought to improve the efficiency of the process by overexpression of the genes involved. A conventional approach of isolating the presumed epoxidase and its corresponding gene was not possible since cPA epoxidation could not be achieved with protein extracts. As an alternative approach, proteins induced by cPA were detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The observation that a 31 -kDa protein (EpoA) was both cPA induced and overaccumulated in a strain which more efficiently converted cPA suggested that it might take part in the bioconversion. EpoA was purified, its amino acid sequence was partially determined, and the corresponding gene was isolated from cosmid and cDNA libraries with oligonucleotide probes. The DNA sequence for this gene (epoA) contained two introns and an open reading frame encoding a peptide of 277 amino acids having some similarity to oxygenases. When the gene was subcloned into P. decumbens, a fourfold increase in epoxidation activity was achieved. epoA-disruption mutants which were obtained by homologous recombination could not convert cPA to FOM.

40|$|Rationale. Evaluation of the {{potential}} allergenicity of proteins derived from genetically modified foods has involved a weight of evidence approach that incorporates an evaluation of protein digestibility in pepsin. Currently, there is no standardized protocol to assess the digestibility of proteins using simulated gastric fluid. Potential variations in assay parameters include: pH, pepsin purity, pepsin to target protein ratio, target protein purity, and method of detection. The objective {{was to assess the}} digestibility of a common set of proteins in nine independent laboratories to determine the reproducibility of the assay when performed using a common protocol. Methods. A single lot of each test protein and pepsin was obtained and distributed to each laboratory. The test proteins consisted of Ara h 2 (a peanut conglutin-like protein), beta-lactoglobulin, bovine serum albumin, concanavalin A, horseradish peroxidase, ovalbumin, ovomucoid, <b>phosphinothricin</b> <b>acetyltransferase,</b> ribulose diphosphate carboxylase, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. A ratio of 10 U of pepsin activity/microg test protein was selected for all tests (3 : 1 pepsin to protein, w:w). Digestions were performed at pH 1. 2 and 2. 0, with sampling at 0. 5, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min. Protein digestibility was assessed from stained gels following SDS-PAGE of digestion samples and controls. Results. Results were relatively consistent across laboratories for the full-length proteins. The identification of proteolytic fragments was less consistent, being affected by different fixation and staining methods. Overall, assay pH did not influence the time to disappearance of the full-length protein or protein fragments, however, results across laboratories were more consistent at pH 1. 2 (91 % agreement) than pH 2. 0 (77 %).

40|$|Plant {{promoters}} are {{the principle}} cis-acting regulatory sequences {{responsible for the}} temporal and spatial expression of genes. One method for isolating plant promoters {{is based on the}} ability of a common soil bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, to transfer a specific segment of DNA (T-DNA) into plant cells. This specific T-DNA has been shown to integrate stably into the recipient plant genome. If the T-DNA contains a promoterless marker gene, then T-DNA integration events occurring adjacent and downstream to a promoter region can be detected by the activation of the marker gene. These T-DNA-mediated gene fusions, consisting of an unknown plant promoter sequence and the coding sequence of a marker gene, can be isolated using the marker gene as a promoter tag. The key objective of this work was to develop a novel, bifunctional selectable marker gene and assess its use as: a selectable marker gene in bacterial and plant transformation systems, and as a promoter tag for T-DNA promoter-tagging studies in dicots. A bifunctional fusion gene was produced between <b>phosphinothricin</b> <b>acetyltransferase</b> and neomycin phosphotransferase (PAT::NPT II), by fusing an NPT II coding sequence to the 3 ' terminus of the PAT gene. The PAT gene product confers tolerance to a non-selective herbicide L-phosphinothricin (Ignite™, Hoechst AG). The neomycin phosphotransferase ('npt II') gene allows for direct selection of transformed cells with the antibiotic, kanamycin. Using an in vivo Escherichia coli selection system, a translational fusion gene between these two reporter genes was achieved. The resulting protein had activities of both parent enzymes. This was demonstrated both in transformed Escherichia coli and in transformed Nicotiana tabacum and Brassica napus plants. Using this bifunctional selectable marker gene, a T-DNA promoter tagging vector, pBAU 2, was constructed and its utility was demonstrated in Nicotiana tabacum.

Essential modifications were made to conditions for Agrobacterium tumefaciens co-cultivation, results demonstrated that deletion of coconut water from the co-cultivation medium resulted in substantially increased transient and stable GUS gene expression. ^ The bar gene encoding <b>phosphinothricin</b> <b>acetyltransferase</b> that inactivates glufosinate-ammonium was transformed into peppermint. One hundred and forty-two transgenic peppermint plants were obtained and examined for herbicide resistance in the greenhouse after foliar application of glufosinate herbicide. Among them, forty-four lines were evaluated for herbicide resistance and agricultural performance under field conditions. Results showed that all transgenic plants had greater herbicide resistance, albeit a large variation was obtained among the transgenic lines. The transgenic line 94 - 2 was highly herbicide resistant, and no leaf injury, reduction in plant biomass and oil yield were observed to a 8 -fold recommended application dosage. Analysis of oil profiles showed that most plants produced a typical commercially acceptable peppermint oil. Results demonstrated that overexpression of the bar gene effectively protected transgenic peppermint plants. ^ Protocols and media constituents for efficient in vitro plant regeneration of Native Spearmint have been defined. Adventitious shoots were initiated either directly from morphogenetically competent cells of explants or primary callus. Explants from basal portions of leaves {{at the bottom of the}} 2 -month old shoots exhibited the greatest morphogenetic capacity. High frequency of meristemoids and morphogenetic callus were initiated from explants cultured onto a Murashige and Skoog basal media supplemented with 4 mg/L thidiazuron and 25 % (vol/vol) coconut water. Bud and shoot development require removal of both TDZ and CW from the media. Peppermint and spearmint are specialty crops of considerable economic value of mint essential oil. The primary constraint to oil production is crop yield loss attributable to pests and pathogens. However, host plant resistance to pests and diseases has not been achieved through conventional breeding because of their steribility. Transgenic approaches provide a powerful tool for utilizing biotechnology in mint crop improvement. In this study, substantial improvement in peppermint genetic transformation has been achieved so that the frequency of transgenic plants regenerated was more than 20 -fold greater than with the original protocol at 1 %.

40|$|Lily (Lilium spp.) {{is among}} the most {{traditional}} and beloved ornamental flowers worldwide. The genus Lilium comprises almost one hundred species, among which is the primary subject of our research, described in this thesis, the species Lilium longiflorum (Thunb.), known as trumpet lily or Easter lily. Despite the great economic importance of ornamental lily species, little is known about its biology at the molecular level so far. In a time when two genomes are fully sequenced, Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, only a few genes have been characterized in Lilium spp. yet. Possible reasons for this are discussed throughout this thesis. This work intends to be a contribution to bridging the fundamental research concerning transcription factors involved in development of flower morphology in model species and the applied objectives of molecular breeding for manipulating flower morphology, endeavouring to create new cultivars with specific and novel features, more specifically in Lilium spp. The ABC model for floral development was proposed more than 10 years ago and since then many studies have been performed in model species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Antirrhinum majus, petunia and many other species in order to confirm this model. This investigation has led to additional information on flower development and to more complex molecular models. In the first chapter of this thesis, notions of molecular floral development, the difficulties of working with molecular biology of lily, the state-of-the-art in lily transformation are introduced, as well as general overviews of transcription factors, MADS-box genes, the ABCDE model for flower development and functional characterization of genes in heterologous systems. These concepts will guide the reader throughout the work we present here. AGAMOUS (AG) is the only C type gene found in Arabidopsis and it is responsible for stamen and carpel development as well as floral determinacy. In the second chapter, we describe the isolation of LLAG 1, a putative AG orthologue from lily (L. longiflorum) by screening a cDNA library derived from developing floral buds. The deduced amino acid sequence of LLAG 1 revealed the MIKC structure and a high homology in the MADS-box among AG and other orthologues. Phylogenetic analysis indicated close relationship between LLAG 1 and AG orthologues from monocot species. Spatial expression data showed LLAG 1 transcripts exclusively in stamens and carpels, constituting the C domain of the ABC model. Functional analysis was carried out in Arabidopsis by overexpression of LLAG 1 driven by the CaMV 35 S promoter. Transformed plants showed homeotic changes in the two outer floral whorls with some plants having the second whorl completely converted into stamens. Altogether, these data indicate a functional relationship between LLAG 1 and AG. (SEP 3) is a MADS-box homeotic gene possibly determining the E function in the ABCDE model. This function is essential for proper development of petals, stamens and carpels. In order to gain further information on lily (Lilium longiflorum) flower development at the molecular level, the cDNA library constructed from developing floral buds was screened again and our findings are reported in the chapter three. A clone (LLSEP 3) was isolated with high similarity to the SEP 3 transcription factor from Arabidopsis. LLSEP 3 belongs to the AGL 2 subfamily of MADS-box genes and shares its closest relationships with DOMADS 1 and OM 1, from the orchid species Dendrobium grex and Aranda deborah, respectively. Expression analysis by Northern hybridisation showed that LLSEP 3 was expressed throughout lily flower development and in tepals, stamens and carpel tissues of mature flowers, whereas no expression was detected in leaves. Overexpression of LLSEP 3 in Arabidopsis under the CaMV 35 S promoter induced early flowering but did not induce any floral homeotic changes, which is in accordance with the effect of SEP 3 overexpression in this species. Altogether, these data are consistent with the putative role of LLSEP 3 as an E functional gene in lily flower development. Drawbacks found during our work on functional characterisation of LLAG 1, by means of complementing the agamous mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana are described and critically discussed in chapter four. Such difficulties are, on the one hand, the nature of the AGAMOUS gene, of which the loss of function induces sterility and, on the other hand, the unavailability of the defective ag- 1 allele in another Arabidopsis background than the Landsberg erecta ecotype, which is recognisably difficult to transform by the floral dip method. Even though we did not manage to complement the AG function with LLAG 1 in a defective ag genotype so far, we could observe clear floral homeotic changes in those Arabidopsis plants ectopically overexpressing LLAG 1, which together with our data on sequence identities and expression profile described in the previous chapter of this thesis, indicated that LLAG 1 is a strong candidate to control the C function in L. longiflorum. This work also contributes towards the improvement of lily transformation procedures. In the chapter five we describe a transformation of bulblet slices by particle bombardment using a vector carrying the ArabidopsisSUPERMAN gene driven by the petunia flower-specific FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN 1 promoter and the bialaphos resistance gene <b>phosphinothricin</b> <b>acetyltransferase</b> under the CaMV 35 S promoter. Our intentions were improving the transformation parameters for lily transformation in order to reach higher efficiency, and creating novel phenotypes in lily flowers using transcription factors originating from dicot plants. We were capable of obtaining transgenic lines expressing in vitro resistance to bialaphos. The transgenic plants were transferred to the greenhouse, grown and monitored for two flowering seasons. Flowers derived from these plants appeared normal and indistinguishable from wild-type flowers and the possible reasons for this are currently under investigation. Homeotic changes in floral organs of lily (Lilium spp.) are described in chapter six. Usually, lily flowers show similar organs in their first and second whorls called tepals. They constitute the appealing and colourful features determining flower appearance. Stamens and the pistil appear as the third and fourth whorls, respectively. A double lily flower shows replacement of stamens by tepals and of its carpel by a new flower in a reiterated manner, similar to what is seen in the agamous mutant of Arabidopsis. A novel floral phenotype of lily, denominated festiva here, has never been reported in other species so far and shows a complete homeotic change of stamens into tepals, but keeps the carpel identity. We tried to explain these phenotypes taking into consideration all the evidence on the genetic mechanisms involved in flower development gathered over the last 15 years. This work launches challenges and encouragement for exploiting the molecular mechanisms involved in flower development of lily. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system has shown to be of great potential in reverse plant genetics. Advantages of VIGS over other approaches, such as T-DNA or transposon tagging, include the circumvention of plant transformation, methodological simplicity and robustness, and speedy results. These features enable VIGS as an alternative instrument in functional genomics, even in a high throughput fashion. The system is already well established in Nicotiana benthamiana, but efforts are being addressed to improve VIGS in other species, including monocots. Current research is focussed on unravelling the silencing mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and VIGS, as well as finding novel viral vectors in order to broaden the host species spectrum. In chapter seven, we discuss the advantages of using VIGS to assess gene functions in plants. We address the molecular mechanisms involved in the process, present the available methodological elements such as vectors, inoculation procedures, and we show examples in which the system was applied successfully to characterize gene function in plants. Moreover, we analyse the potential application of VIGS in assessing genetic function of floral transcription factors from monocots. Analyses of gene functions involved in lily flower development and generation of useful information on the molecular breeding potential of this species were the main objectives of the work described in this thesis. The field for studying the molecular aspects of lily flower development is now wide open and the future may uncover very interesting aspects that will produce new tools for ornamental breeders as well as reveal particular features of monocots and the Liliaceae plant family...|$|E
