40|$|International audienceOn May 23, 2007 the European Parliament and the Council {{adopted the}} Directive 2007 / 23 /EC on the placing {{on the market}} of <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles.</b> This newly {{published}} text is another piece of the European regulation concerning explosives and <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles.</b> It completes the Directive 93 / 15 /EEC of 5 April 1993 on the harmonisation of the provision relating to the {{placing on the market}} and supervision of explosives for civil uses. These two Directives following the "new approach" aim at ensuring the free movement of products within the European Union (EU), improving safety of both consumers and professionals and implementing harmonised safety requirements for such products in all Members States. Thus, the Directive 2007 / 23 /EC applies specifically to <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles</b> and their placing on the EU market, but what are they {{and how do you know}} if you are concerned ? As Notified Body and Official Laboratory in France INERIS has gained a lot of experience in testing, certifying and approving explosives and <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles.</b> In this paper we give an insight of the different parts of the Directive 2007 / 23 /EC, we answer the title question and we present the possible frame of the CE marking and certification procedure for <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles...</b>|$|R

Therefore a European frame for the approval of <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles</b> for vehicles is now set up by introducing harmonized Essential Safety Requirements (ESR), CE marking and certification procedures. For manufacturers and importers that had to comply with a different regulation in each country to get technical approvals of their products the principle "tested once, accepted everywhere" is a great achievement. Although this EU directive will reduce the administrative burden for everybody, its substitution and application instead of the current national regulations may create difficulties at the beginning.

40|$|International audienceFor {{manufacturers}} and importers that generally have {{to comply with}} a different regulation in each country to get technical approvals for their products the principle "tested once, accepted everywhere" is a great expectancy. The Directive 2007 / 23 /EC [1] concerning the placing on the market and the use of <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles</b> could fulfil those dealing with automotive occupant restraint systems (mainly airbags and seat belts pretensioners). By introducing harmonised Essential Safety Requirements (ESR) this new Directive offers the possibilities to replace the National approval procedures concerned by a single legal framework throughout the European Union (EU) for these <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles.</b> Although this EU directive will reduce the administrative burden for everybody by introducing the CE marking and certification procedure, its substitution and application in replacement of the current National regulatory frameworks may create difficulties at the beginning. In this paper we present the different parts of the Directive specifically these concerning pyrotechnic devices for automotive safety and how to comply with it. As Notified Body and Official Laboratory in France INERIS has gained lot of experience in testing, certifying and approving explosives and pyrotechnic devices. In order to ease the understanding of the CE marking and certification procedure for automotive <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles,</b> we suggest and give examples of known test procedures to cope with the Essential Safety Requirements (ESR) ...|$|R
40|$|National audienceThe Directive 2007 / 23 /EC of the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council on the {{placing on}} the market of <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles</b> has been adopted by the European Union (EU) on the 23 rd of May, 2007. This Directive should help {{manufacturers}} and importers that had to comply with a different regulation in each country to get technical approvals of their <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles.</b> Although this directive will reduce the administrative burden for everybody by introducing the CE marking and certification procedure, its substitution and application instead of the current national regulations may create difficulties in the beginning. In this paper we present information related to the different parts of the Directive dealing specifically with fireworks; taking into account the present French regulation and European standards on fireworks, we remind and comment topics like categorisation, labelling, testing methods for fireworks characterisation and requirements for safety levels; these elements are reviewed and commented in the scope to help people concerned to comply with the Essential Safety Requirements (ESR) of the new Directive...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the European Union (EU) <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles</b> are {{subjected}} to comply with national regulations {{in addition to a}} series of EU Directives. In order to harmonize regulations in the EU, the placing on the market of <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles</b> is going to fall under the scope of a new European Directive. Among these <b>articles,</b> one finds <b>pyrotechnic</b> components of automotive safety equipment such as gas generators or igniters. In the very fast growing market of automotive safety industry, regulations might be perceived as non-technical barriers to innovation in the field. Conversely, through innovation arguments, industries sometimes try to promote specific cases of exemptions to comply various regulations. In a broad approach, we examine both regulation and industrial recent repercussions in the field of pyrotechnic devices for automotive safety, as these points of view face each other too often. Considerations regarding design, transport classification, approvals, safety features, environmental issues and treatment of end-life waste disposal are provided along the life cycle of the products. We enlighten needs in term of harmonized standards and technical procedures to answer regulation requirements. Such needs bring new perspectives and make room to various stakeholders for possible and efficient developments...|$|R

In the meantime, combustion heat has profound guiding significance for compound design and safe handling of <b>pyrotechnics.</b> This <b>article</b> utilizes oxygen bomb calorimeter to determine the combustion heat of certain kinds of pyrotechnics, using Hess Law to derive combustion reaction of pyrotechnics that may occur, and analyzing the reasons of differences between the theoretical value with the experimental value...|$|R
40|$|A basic {{characteristic}} of the supply chain of fireworks is that most manufacturers {{are located in the}} Far East. Considering control results on tests made by CERL and INERIS on fireworks coming from this area (mainly from China), and taking into account that a new Directive has been published in 2007 in Europe for the certification of <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles</b> (including fire-works), it seems clear {{that it is necessary to}} put in place an additional system for checking and certifying the fireworks, when importers of fireworks cannot check the imported batches by themselves according to the existing or newly arriving standards. This system could be applicable to manufacturers not belonging to the European Union or to control laboratories, and can be extended to any other country wishing to improve the safety of use of fireworks. We present in this paper our views concerning such a system;- a comparison between the checking procedure applied by the Canada (CERL) – i. e. on all imported batches- and those made by France (INERIS) – i. e. on samples taken on the spot in the importers warehouses on imported fireworks from the far east, and some results- some proposals on criteria of minimal competence (qualified or accredited testing laboratory, competent people, testing equipment, testing procedures, …) to put in place in order to qualify the manufacturers exporting into Europe, or local control bodies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMost {{fireworks}} {{that are}} used in Europe and North America are produced by manufacturers located in the Far East. Considering the results of tests performed by the Canadian Explosives Research Laboratory (CERL) and INERIS on fireworks imported into their jurisdictions (mainly from China), and taking into account that a new Directive has been published in 2007 in Europe for the certification of <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>articles</b> (including fireworks), it has becomes apparent {{that it is necessary to}} implement an additional system for examining and certifying the fireworks, when importers themselves are not capable of testing the products in accordance with the existing or newly introduced standards. This system could be applied to manufacturers or control laboratories outside of the European Union, and could be applicable to any country wishing to improve the safety of use of fireworks (safety for consumers and safety during display). We present our views in this paper regarding the proposed system : - a comparison between the examination procedures applied by Canada to imported fireworks and their consequential results, and those applied by France (INERIS) to grab samples taken in the importers warehouses imported fireworks from the far east, and their results - some proposals on criteria of minimal competence (qualified or accredited testing laboratory, competent people, testing equipment, testing procedures, [...] .) to implement in order to qualify the manufacturers exporting into Europe, or local control bodies...|$|R
5000|$|Chemicals are {{regulated}} under various laws including the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). In 2010, Congress was considering {{a new law}} entitled the Safe Chemicals Act. Over the following several years, the Senate considered a number of legislative texts to amend the TSCA. These included the Safer Chemicals Act, several versions of which were introduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), with the latest in 2013, and the Chemical Safety Improvement Act (S. 1009, CSIA) introduced by Senators Lautenberg and David Vitter (R-LA) in 2013. Senator Lautenberg died shortly after CSIA's introduction, and over time his mantle {{was picked up by}} Senator Tom Udall (D-NM), who continued to work with Senator Vitter on revisions to the CSIA. The result of that effort was the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, passed by the Senate on December 17, 2015. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Modernization Act of 2015 (H.R. 2576), passed the House of Representatives on June 23, 2015. Revised legislation, which resolved differences between the House and Senate versions, was forwarded to the President on June 14, 2016. [...] President Obama signed the bill into law on June 22, 2016. The Senator's widow, Bonnie Lautenberg, was present at the White House signing ceremony.
