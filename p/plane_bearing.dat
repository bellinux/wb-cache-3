However, {{at the end of the}} war he crashes in a <b>plane</b> <b>bearing</b> USSR insignia. Although rescued by North Korean troops he is felt to have risked revealing that Soviet aircrew participated in the conflict and on cessation of hostilities he is exiled in disgrace to a polar base. He has been befriended by one of his groundcrew, (throughout referred to as 'The Widow'), who follows him north, and he eventually marries her. He becomes a trainee cosmonaut, with little hope of a mission; he eventually volunteers for a risky mission to attempt a lunar landing ahead of Apollo 11, in an untested lunar craft. He knows that if he fails, his death will lead to little comment, and be denied by the USSR. He succeeds in achieving a landing, on the far side of the Moon, but the lander rocket has malfunctioned, leaving him no hope of return. The novel ends with his descending from the doomed craft to walk on the lunar surface, as the lights in the stranded craft gradually go out.|$|E

Nas orientações dadas pelo Currículo de Matemática da Secretaria da Educação do Estado de São Paulo (SEE), um estudo das retas, com suas equações, propriedades e aplicações deve ser introduzido no ensino básico, mais precisamente, no início da 3 ª Série do Ensino Médio.

As the need for energy conservation has increased, the field of composite bolted joints has found new applications in ground armoured vehicles. Thick panels able to withstand large in-plane and impact loads are critical. The present investigation evaluates the interior strain field, through the thickness, of a composite plate connected to an aluminium panel with a single-lap bolted joint. The area of interest is the <b>bearing</b> <b>plane</b> region close to the hole {{because of the presence}} of stress concentrations that heavily modify the stress field. Experimental data for the bolted joint were recorded by fibre-optic strain gauges that were embedded in the <b>bearing</b> <b>plane</b> of the composite plate. Numerical analyses were performed using ANSYS as a pre-processor and LS-DYNA as a solver. The overall goal was to evaluate the magnitude of contact strains around the hole and through the thickness of the composite. These values were analysed and compared with the finite-element method results: the finite-element analysis correlated reasonably well with the experiments. An investigation of error causes was also carried out, in particular to evaluate the influence of incorrect gauge positioning and the effect of friction coefficients.

Although very slow, poorly armed and virtually defenseless during the day, the nearly all-wood structure Po-2 was exceptionally cheap and reliable, could carry six small (50 kilo) HE bombs and was nearly silent when flown by an expert at night; its small, low-RPM five-cylinder radial piston engine produced only a muted rattling for a sound signature, far quieter and less identifiable than the supercharged aero-engines of a then-modern fighter/bomber.

The finite element approximations to the steady isothermal flows are computed without resorting to the lubrication approximation. We obtain the numerical solutions as long as the variation of the viscous stress S= 2 η(p,trD^ 2) D with the pressure is limited, say |∂S/∂ p|≤ 1. We show conclusively that the existing practice of avoiding the numerical difficulties by cutting the viscosity off for large pressures leads to results that depend sorely on the artificial cut-off parameter.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a quasi-homogeneous isenthalpic cavitation flow model, suitably modified to account for thermal cavitation, and its application to the study of <b>plane</b> journal <b>bearings</b> with constant eccentricity. The proposed model treats the cavitating and noncavitating portions of the fluid in a unified manner with the aim of avoiding the use of matching conditions at the phase interface, whose accuracy is questionable in the presence of significant inertial and/or unsteady effects. A non-linear analysis which accounts for the inertia of the lubricant is used to determine the reaction forces caused by the shaft eccentricity both in the viscosity-dominated regime and at intermediate values of the Reynolds number, where the inertia of the lubricant is no longer negligible. The classical iteration method for the Reynolds lubrication equation (Muster and Sternlicht, 1965; Mori and Mori, 1991; Reinhardt and Lund, 1975) has been extended to the two-phase flow case in order to account for flow acceleration effects in the presence of cavitation.
