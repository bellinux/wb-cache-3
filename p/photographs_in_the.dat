5|$|By {{the end of}} 1903, {{at the age of}} 26, Beebe had {{published}} more than thirty-four articles and <b>photographs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past year. For his contributions to science, he was elected a fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science.|$|E
5|$|While some Danish {{newspapers}} {{started to}} include <b>photographs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1890s, {{it was only}} in the 1950s that press photography was introduced throughout the country. Taking the French-based international photographic bureau Magnum as a model, Jesper Høm, Gregers Nielsen and others set up Delta Photos, a group designed to support journalistic photography.|$|E
5|$|All {{but two of}} the Hydrobatidae {{are mostly}} dark in colour with varying amounts of white on the rump. Two species have {{different}} plumage entirely, the Hornby's storm petrel which has white undersides and facial markings, and the fork-tailed storm petrel which has pale grey plumage. This is a notoriously difficult group to identify at sea. Onley and Scofield (2007) state that much published information is incorrect, and that <b>photographs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> major seabird books and websites are frequently incorrectly ascribed as to species. They also consider that several national bird lists include species which have been incorrectly identified or have been accepted on inadequate evidence.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{innovations}} of Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried, Farsari {{further developed the}} trade in photograph albums. His studio generally produced sepia monochrome albumen prints that were hand-coloured and mounted on album leaves. These pages were often hand decorated and bound between covers of silk brocade or lacquer boards inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl and gold. Like his contemporaries, Farsari usually captioned and numbered his <b>photographs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> images, often in white lettering on a black background.|$|E
5|$|Her father {{found her}} {{correspondence}} and sifted through it, burning letters and <b>photographs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fireplace. At 5:10 pm {{he called the}} Halstead Funeral Home, who contacted the police. The police arrived at 5:30 pm, accompanied by the deputy coroner. At {{the time of her}} death she was under surveillance by the FBI, and her phone had been tapped, so {{one of the first people}} informed about it was FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, via a teletype link. The news of her death was reported in Bay Area newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Douglas {{published}} no {{writings of}} his own and left no records of his ideas and thoughts. The only publication with which he was associated was the Abbey Square Sketch Book, which he edited. The book appeared in three volumes, the first dated 1872 and the others undated; it consisted of sketches and drawings (with some <b>photographs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third volume) by many contributors. The pictures depicted buildings and furniture, mainly dating from the late medieval period and the 16th and 17thcenturies, and mostly from Cheshire and northwest England. Douglas's only contribution was a jointly ascribed plate in the third volume. It is likely that he designed the title pages, or at least the drawing incorporated in it, of the Abbey Gateway in Chester.|$|E

5|$|Simon Kingdom (played by Dominic Mafham) was {{an unseen}} {{character}} (with {{the exception of}} some <b>photographs)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first series, with the final episode revealing that he had fled to Dublin, apparently to escape large debts. In the second series, he returns to Market Shipborough and is charged with faking his own death. Simon {{has a reputation as}} a ne'er-do-well, and usually behaves in a self-centered manner. At {{the end of the second}} series, he disappears after fleeing from a Mafia-type gang during a storm. It is revealed at the start of series three that he now really is dead, with the opening scene showing Peter, Beatrice and Auriel standing at his grave.|$|E
5|$|Square {{accumulated}} four SGI Origin 2000 series servers, four Onyx2 systems, and 167 Octane workstations for the film's production. The basic {{film was}} rendered at a custom render farm created by Square in Hawaii. It housed 960 Pentium III-933MHz workstations. Character movements were filmed using motion capture technology. Animator Matthew Hackett stated that while motion capture was effective {{for many of}} the scenes, in others animators still had to add movements manually. Hand and facial movements were all done manually. Some of General Hein's facial features and poses were based on Hackett. As animators did not want to use any actual <b>photographs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film, all backgrounds were done using matte paintings. 1,327 scenes in total needed to be filmed to animate the digital characters. The film consists of 141,964 frames, with each frame taking an average of 90 minutes to render. By the end of production Square had a total of 15 terabytes of artwork for the film. It is estimated that over the film's four-year production, approximately 200 people put in a combined 120 years of work on it.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Antoinism {{was very quiet}} after 1940. In Belgium, Joseph Nihoul, the President of the Antoinist Council, then his successors, led the {{religion}} until their death, alongside {{the members of this}} body. The authority of Catherine was challenged just after her death by the Belgian branch of the movement, which has withdrawn the religious changes she made: removal of <b>photographs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temples, deletion of baptism, marriage and communion, opposition to the translation of Antoine's works... However, a Belgian group who, claiming to be faithful to the true Antoinist tradition, opened a temple in Angleur on 1 April 1943, preferred to keep the portraits of the Antoines in the temple. In France, the Antoinists wanted to be faithful to all requirements provided by the founding couple. In spite of these differences, the two branches show each other support and tolerance. Thus, after the death of Catherine, there were two forms of Antoinism, which still remain different today: one in Belgium, and one in France.|$|E

25|$|He {{believed}} in composing his <b>photographs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> viewfinder, {{not in the}} darkroom. He showcased this belief by having nearly all his photographs printed only at full-frame and completely free of any cropping or other darkroom manipulation. He insisted that his prints were not cropped as they include the first few millimeters of the unexposed negative around the image area, resulting in a black frame around the developed picture.|$|E
25|$|<b>Photographs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{media of}} the pilot whale drive display a red sea soaked in blood with the bodies of dead pilot whales. These images cause outrage worldwide. Proponents of the whale drive will defend these images saying that blood is a natural {{consequence}} of any animal slaughter and {{that those who have}} been outraged have been alienated from the process and basic consequences of animal food production.|$|E
25|$|The Edna S. Purcell House {{was known}} to architects of its time, {{published}} and pictured extensively in the Western Architect. It was also published with several <b>photographs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> March 1917 issue of The Minnesotan. Purcell himself, and later architectural scholars like David Gebhard and H. Allen Brooks, would declare the house {{to be one of}} the most complete works of architecture by the firm of Purcell and Elmslie, if not the most complete.|$|E

25|$|Disobeying orders {{intended}} to smother {{news of the}} massacres (as the Ottoman Empire and Germany were allies), he gathered information on the massacres, collected documents, annotations, notes, and letters and took hundreds of <b>photographs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Armenian deportation camps in Deir ez-Zor, which later served to evidence {{the extent of the}} atrocities to which the Ottoman Armenians were subjected. At the Ottoman command's request, Wegner was eventually arrested by the Germans and recalled to Germany. While some of his photographs were confiscated and destroyed, he nonetheless succeeded in smuggling out many images of the Armenian persecution by hiding the negatives in his belt.|$|E
25|$|Rakes was {{swinging}} {{the flag and}} trying to hit him, not trying to spear him as it appears in the photo, and he narrowly missed. Landsmark was bloodied during the incident. An examination of all the <b>photographs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> roll Forman shot reveals that Rakes missed Landsmark with the flag. Although anti-busing activist Jim Kelly appears to pin Landsmark's arms behind him, he is actually helping Landsmark to his feet. Kelly later positions himself between Landsmark and the other protestors to protect the lawyer. Landsmark had already been knocked to the ground, losing his glasses and suffering a broken nose, {{by the time he}} got up the famous picture was taken.|$|E
