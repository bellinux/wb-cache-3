40|$|SUMMARY A {{diagnosis}} of <b>pulseless</b> <b>disease</b> {{was made in}} a young European female patient who presented with symptoms confined to the visual system. She demonstrated the classical ocular features of <b>pulseless</b> <b>disease</b> but developed the previously unrecorded complication of ischaemic optic neuropathy. These findings are discussed. Ocular symptoms may be the presenting feature of occlusive disease in vessels arising from the aortic arch. Reduced perfusion to {{the upper part of}} the body leads to diminished or absent peripheral pulses, making the descriptive term 'pulseless disease ' a suitable alternative to the many eponymous titles ' for this condition. In 1827 Robert Adams 2 recorded the first case of <b>pulseless</b> <b>disease.</b> Twelve years later an elegant des-cription by Davy 3 detailed the symptoms of confusion and syncope in a 55 -year-old British Army officer. His illness was attributed to a chest wound sustained at the Battle of Waterloo. At necropsy a thoracic aortic aneurysm was found with involvement of the great vessels suggesting a {{diagnosis of}} syphilis. During life diminished pulsation at the neck and wrist had been noted. In 1908 Takayasu 4 was the first to describe the retinal complications, and at the same meeting Onishi and Kagashini related the ocular changes to the absence of radial pulses. Comprehensive accounts of the clinical features with pathological correlation followed, and an elaborate review by Pinkham 5 in 1955 established visual symptoms in at least 70 % of the patients. In 1976 Uyama and Asayama 6 reclassi-fied the retinal changes and found a correlation between microaneurysm formation and the systolic ophthalmodynamometry pressures.

40|$|BACKGROUND Aortoarteritis is {{also known}} as Takayasu Arteritis, Aortic Arch Syndrome and <b>Pulseless</b> <b>Disease.</b> The disease is a rare {{vascular}} disease that cause progressive damage including inflammation, scarring, narrowing and abnormal ballooning inside the wall of aorta and major arteries with formation of aneurysms. Thus, the disease carries high morbidity and mortality. The occurrence of aortoarteritis during pregnancy is a very rare occurrence. The complications are fatal with the continuation of pregnancy. We are reporting a case of aortoarteritis in pregnancy diagnosed first at 19 weeks of gestation for Medical Termination of Pregnancy and successful outcome was achieved by combined multidisciplinary approach...|$|E
40|$|Takayasu's {{arteritis}} {{or disease}} is a rare, idiopathic, chronic inflammatory disease which causes narrowing, occlusion or aneurysms of blood vessels. It preferentially affects large arteries such as the aorta and its branches and hence its alternative names of <b>pulseless</b> <b>disease,</b> occlusive thromboaortopathy or aortic arch syndrome. Although most commonly found in oriental women, it occurs sporadically throughout the world. We present {{the case of an}} elderly primigravida with long-standing Takayasu's disease complicated by hospital and needle phobia who underwent a successful Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of Takayasu’s arteritis {{is likely to}} date {{back as far as}} 1830, owing to the first description of the Japanese Rokushu Yamamoto. Thereafter, several authors from certain geographical areas and in various historical periods described such a vascular disorder, by introducing a quantity of definitions. At present, it is defined as an eponymic disease, namely Takayasu’s arteritis, since Makito Takayasu, a Japanese ophtalmologist, reported in 1908 the clinical history of a woman showing some particular retinal anastomotic shunts of arterioles and venules. In the present study the description of an about 40 year-old woman suffering from a <b>pulseless</b> <b>disease,</b> as reported by Giovanni Battista Morgagni in 1761, is summarized. Such a description could be the first case report of Takayasu’s arteritis, according to some previous literature data and our critical analysis...|$|E
40|$|Absfrucf. Changes {{consistent}} with those of giant cell arteritis were found in the ascend-ing aorta of a mature male South American monkey, Cullimico goeldii. The essential change was necrosis of the tunica media with associated granulomatous inflammatory reaction. There also were compensatory fibroelastic thickening of the tunica intima and lymphocytic-plasniacytic cellular infiltrations of the tunica adventitia. The animal presented clinical signs of a respiratory infection 8 weeks before it died from circulatory insufficiency. Spontaneous diseases of nonhuman primates that simulate diseases i n man are potential models for use i n biomedical research.

40|$|The {{absence of}} pulses in both upper extremities, with normal or {{increased}} {{pressure in the}} lower ones, has been known as the so-called " <b>pulseless</b> <b>disease</b> " or Takayasu disease. In the reported cases, the cause was an arteritis of the aortic arch and, although mentioned as a possibility, no case due to an aortic arch anomaly has been described. In the case to be reported, the absence of pulses was due to a rather unusual anomaly of the aortic arch. Case Report A 30 -year-old man {{was admitted to the}} hospital ward with a right-sided hemiplegia, already improving. He was leading a normal life, working as a radio-operator, until 11 days before admission, when he com-plained of dizziness and headache, and after a few days {{woke up in the morning}} unable to walk or talk.

40|$|Background and objectivesTakayasu’s arteritis, {{so-called}} <b>pulseless</b> <b>disease,</b> is a syndrome mostly seen {{in young}} women. It is a chronic inflammatory arteritis affecting large vessels. It {{is associated with}} abnormal angiography of the upper aorta and its main branches, resulting in vascular impairment in the upper extremities. This report presents a case of successful pregnancy in a patient with Takayasu’s arteritis. CaseThe patient was a 36 years old G 2 P 1 woman. Her first child was delivered by cesarean section. She was suffering from Takayasu’s arteritis and was treated with prednisolone since 7 years ago. She had an unplanned pregnancy after expulsion of IUD. In her past medical history, in addition to Takayasu’s arteritis involving subclavian artery, an iodine 131 ablation for treatment of hyperthyroidism was noticed. She was first sought medical attention at 8 th week of pregnancy and as she had normal cardiopulmonary and renal functions, the pregnancy was continued. Subtotal thyroidectomy was performed at 10 th week of gestation following a suspicious FNA showing a cold thyroid nodule. She was then treated with thyroxine in addition to prednisolone to control the post-thyroidectomy hypothyroidism. At 37 th week, her pregnancy was terminated by cesarean section with epidural analgesia because of reduction of amniotic fluid index and a BPS of 8 / 10.

40|$|Takayasu's {{arteritis}} {{also known}} as <b>pulseless</b> <b>disease</b> {{is a kind of}} granulomatous vasculitis that characterized large size vessels involvement with massive intimal fibrosis. It is usually occurs in female gender in middle ages. Unusual Takayasu's arteritis case with different clinical presentation was reported in current paper. A 42 years old male patient was admitted to cardiovascular surgery clinic with sudden onset cyanosis in first finger of right hand. There was not any finding or complaint in his past medical history. The right brachial, radial and ulnar pulses were not palpable in physical examination and blood pressure could not measured from this extremity. Bilateral upper limb arterial doppler ultrasound revealed minimal flow in right and disrupted biphasic flow pattern in left. Peripheral angiography revealed total occlusion after the osteal segment of right subclavian artery, pre-occlusive stenosis in proximal segment of left subclavian artery and total occlusion in abdominal aorta just prior the iliac bifurcation. There was no serological or biochemical positivity in blood parameters and no additional visualization finding. Antiaggregant, anticoagulant and intravenous peripheral vasodilator therapy was utilized to patient for finger cyanosis. Patient was discharged with full recovery of finger coloration and referred to rheumatology clinic for further investigation. Microembolism may be messenger of wide-spread vascular disorders for example vasculitis. Thus, detailed systemic examinations should be applied in patients who admitted with micro-circulatory system symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Three {{patients}} with Takayasu's disease are described. In 2 cases aortography demonstrated an occlusion {{of the great}} vessels at {{the origin of the}} arch of the aorta. In 1 patient there was concomitant aneurysmal dilatation of the brachiocephalic trunk. Common and internal carotid artery stenosis occurred in 1 patient and was associated with hemiplegia and blindness. All 3 patients had constitutional symptoms and signs of the disease as well as markedly elevated erythro-cyte sedimentation rates: 2 patients had moderate clinical responses to steroid administration in the short term and 1 developed bilateral calf vein thrombosis. which responded satisfactorily to con-servative management S AIr Med J, 985 : 67 : 895 - 897. In 1908 Takayasu, a Japanese ophthalmologist, published a report of the curious fundal appearance in a 21 -year-old woman. ! He focused attention on a clinical syndrome, which had been described under a plethora of names, characterized by ocular disturbance and weakening or absent upper extremity pulses caused by narrowing or obliteration at the origin of the great vessels arising from the aortic arch. H The term <b>pulseless</b> <b>disease</b> was suggested by Shimizu and SanoB in 1951. Although the disease is prevalent in Asia, it is encountered throughout the world and a number of well-documented cases have been reported from Japan, Korea and South Africa. 9 The symptoms, signs and treatment of 3 {{patients with}} Takayasu's disease are discussed. Case reports Case 1 A 23 -year-old coloured woman presented with a 4 -month history of malaise, visual disturbance of the left eye of recent onset and manifestations of Raynaud's phenomenon of the left hand.

40|$|The present study, using {{patients}} with Thkayasu’s disease (<b>pulseless</b> <b>disease),</b> characterized by segmentally affected arterial lesions and stenotic conditions with a nonspecific inflammatory morbid condition, {{was designed to}} assess {{whether or not a}} low dose of aspirin can practically exert its preventive effect against the aggregation of platelets that have just passed along a rough-surfaced arterial wall. Twenty Japanese women with Takayasu’s disease were selected under the following criteria: (1) A unilateral upper extremity was angiographi-cally confirmed to be affected with the disease, while the contralateral limb was almost normal. (2) Systolic blood pressure on the affected side was almost half that on the nonaffected side. (3) The patients showed neither a positive CRP nor an accentuated ESR. In these patients, mean plasma levels of TXB 2 and 3 &mu;M ADP-induced platelet aggregation in blood obtained from the affected side were 156. 5 &plusmn; 17. 7 pg/ml, and 59. 5 &plusmn; 6. 0 %, respectively, which were significantly high as compared with 104. 5 &plusmn; 17. 6 and 41. 7 &plusmn; 8. 8 %, respectively, in samples from the nonaffected side. Forty and eighty mg of aspirin per day administered to two randomly composed groups, respectively, showed an improvement in plate-let aggregability and TXB 2 levels on the nonaffected side. In the affected limbs, though 80 mg/day led to significant decreases in TXB 2 levels (108. 0 &plusmn; 7. 8 pg/ml, p < 0. 05) and platelet aggregability (21. 3 &plusmn; 7. 6 %), the 40 -mg regimen showed no significant reductions (134. 6 &plusmn; 9. 4 pg/ml, 35. 6 &plusmn; 17. 1 %). Plasma levels of 6 -keto PGF 1 &alpha; revealed no differences between 40 - and 80 -mg regimens, or between before and after treatment. These data suggest that a dosage of 80 mg of aspirin per day is effective for long-term treatment in preventing thrombus formation in surface-damaged blood vessels...|$|E
40|$|The audiovestibular {{system can}} be {{affected}} by an immunological etiology; the presence of immune mediated sensorineural hearing loss (IMSNHL) as part of or {{in combination with other}} autoimmune diseases is well documented in the literature. Hearing loss can be caused by autoimmune disorders localized to the inner ear or secondary to systemic immune diseases (Cogan's syndrome, juvenile chronic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, scleroderma, <b>pulseless</b> <b>disease,</b> and SLE). A systemic autoimmune disorder can be present in fewer than one-third of cases The clinical presentation of immune inner-ear disease is extremely variable and depends on the type of immune reaction and on the site of injury within the inner ear. IMSNHL typically presents with an idiopathic, progressive unilateral and successive bilateral rapidly progressive sensorineural hearing loss; the course of the hearing loss occurs over weeks to months and is most common in middle-aged women; it may be accompanied by tinnitus and vertigo and is almost always unilateral. IMSNHL is still a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma, and predicting recovery from it is very difficult. Different factors may influence a prognosis: e. g., severity of hearing loss, duration of symptoms before treatment, presence of vertigo, type of audiogram, and age of patients. The therapeutic approaches normally used for this pathological condition include the systemic and local administration of cortisone, vasoactive agents, anticoagulants, vitamin complexes, a cytotoxic agent and plasmapheresis. These drugs can be effective in reversing such hearing loss, although at the cost of occasionally severe side effects. Currently, evaluating the importance of an autoimmune phenomenon in the genesis of inner-ear disease is difficult because the clinical and biological criteria of autoimmune deafness have not yet been well defined. A positive response to treatment is a criterion for the diagnosis of immune inner-ear disease. This chapter aims to assess the effect of sodium enoxaparin on the recovery of hearing in patients affected by ISSNHL. Sodium enoxaparin was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 4, 000 IU once a day for 10 days. Sodium enoxaparin is a particular kind of heparin with a low molecular weight (LMWH) and is endowed with a high antithrombotic activity. The literature does not report any therapeutic protocols for autoimmune IMSNHL treatment with sodium enoxaparin or other kinds of unfractionated heparin. Our decision to use enoxaparin was based both on the pathogenesis of this condition and on evaluation of the other classes of drugs currently used...|$|E
