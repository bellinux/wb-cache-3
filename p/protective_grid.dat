50|$|The JM model {{appeared}} in 1957, incorporating stamped sheet metal and four-speed gearbox. In 1959 the model Helix went on sale, with stamped metal construction again, and a <b>protective</b> <b>grid</b> {{on the rear}} fenders, probably {{to make it easier}} for women to sit aside on the motorcycle without the skirts been tangled with rear wheel.|$|E
50|$|In spring 2017, a {{comprehensive}} restoration {{program of the}} monument {{at a cost of}} two billion rubles began; {{for a year and a}} half the statue will be covered by scaffolding. The Motherland Calls will also be covered with a protective mesh, the sculpture will be painted over the <b>protective</b> <b>grid.</b> All formed cracks must be repaired and more than 6,000 m2 of concrete surfaces must be restored.|$|E
40|$|Use of a <b>protective</b> <b>grid</b> {{on small}} {{diameter}} microphones can prolong {{the lifetime of}} the unit, but the high frequency effects can complicate data interpretation. Analytical methods {{have been developed to}} correct for the grid effect at high frequencies. Specifically, the analysis pertains to quantifying the microphone <b>protective</b> <b>grid</b> response characteristics in the acoustic near field of a rocket plume noise source. A frequency response function computation using two microphones will be explained. Experimental and instrumentation setup details will be provided. The resulting frequency response function for a B&K 4944 condenser microphone <b>protective</b> <b>grid</b> will be presented, along with associated uncertaintie...|$|E
50|$|There is a {{great variety}} of {{modifications}} to the basic design. As the burner can get very hot, as a safety guard against burns it is often placed into the second, outer can (making the smoker double wall). Alternatively, the burner may be surrounded with a <b>protective</b> wire <b>grid.</b>|$|R
50|$|On August 1, 1966, Charles Whitman barricaded {{himself on}} the {{observation}} deck of the tower of the Main Building with a sniper rifle and various other weapons, killed 14 people on campus, and wounded many more, before being {{shot and killed by}} police. Prior to the massacre, he killed his mother and his wife, while sparing the life of his young son. Following the Whitman incident, the observation deck was closed until 1968, and then closed again in 1975 following a series of suicide jumps during the 1970s. In 1998, after installation of security and safety precautions, the tower observation deck reopened to the public. It is now surrounded by a <b>protective</b> metal <b>grid</b> to impede jumpers, and is open primarily on the weekends when the offices in the tower are not open. Visitors must pass through a metal detector and are accompanied by police and/or student chaperones while on the deck.|$|R
40|$|Br el & Kjaer (B&K) 4944 B {{pressure}} field microphone was judiciously selected to measure acoustic environments, 400 Hz 50 kHz, {{in close proximity}} of the nozzle during multiple firings of solid propellant rocket motors. It {{is well known that}} protective grids can affect the frequency response of microphones. B&K recommends operation of the B&K 4944 B without a <b>protective</b> <b>grid</b> when recording measurements above 10 to 15 kHz...|$|E
40|$|Figure 1 : Resizing a clock model (267 {{connected}} components) : Standard non-uniform scale {{distorts the}} shape of parts of the model, e. g. the dial (b). Our approach resizes the clock in a more natural manner protecting its shape (c). (d) and (e) show part of the <b>protective</b> <b>grid</b> before and after resizing. Resizing of 3 D models can be very useful when creating new models or placing models inside different scenes. However, uniform scaling is limited in its applicability while straightforward nonuniform scaling can destroy features and lead to serious visual artifacts. Our goal is to define a method that protects model features and structures during resizing. We observe that typically, during scaling {{some parts of the}} models are more vulnerable than others, undergoing undesirable deformation. We automatically detect vulnerable regions and carry this information to a <b>protective</b> <b>grid</b> defined around the object, defining a vulnerability map. The 3 D model is then resized by a space-deformation technique which scales the grid non-homogeneously while respecting this map. Using space-deformation allows processing of common models of man-made objects that consist of multiple components and contain non-manifold structures. We show that our technique resizes models while suppressing undesirable distortion, creating models that preserve the structure and features of the original ones...|$|E
