For the <b>past</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>year</b> numerous chromosome reports from plants have been published, especially in the Compositae, and these counts have been compiled in several major sources (Darlington 2 ̆ 6 Wylie, 1955; Cave, 1958 - 65; Ornduff, 1967 - 69; Fedorov, 1969; Moore, 1970 - 72). However, a rapid glance through these references indicates not only that many species never have been counted, but also that many taxa are known only from a single plant in one population. In view of the common occurrence of euploid and aneuploid races in plants as illustrated by several detailed investigations (e. g., Lewis, 1962, 1970; Stuessy, 1971 a), it is desirable to have several to many counts from each species before accurate judgments can be made regarding evolutionary relationships (Stuessy, 1971 b; Kovanda, 1972; Strother, 1972).

Absorbed optical and ultraviolet light heats the dust, whence infrared (including near-infrared to submillimeter) emission, the particular theme of this review. In some distant galaxies, most of the luminosity of the galaxy is thus converted into the infrared, though in the Milky Way the situation is not generally as extreme, except in localized regions of star formation. I briefly review the range of physical conditions in which the dust emits in the interstellar medium and the various sizes of dust probed. Of interest astrophysically are observations of both the spectrum and the spatial distribution of the emission, preferably in combination. In the <b>past</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>year</b> probes of dust emission have advanced significantly: through IRAS, KAO, COBE experiments, IRTS, ISO, and MSX.
