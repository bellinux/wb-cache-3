60|$|Whilst Henry was {{extending}} his conquests {{to the western}} limits of the known world, the whole fabric of his power was privately sapped and undermined, and ready to overwhelm him with the ruins, in the very moment when {{he seemed to be}} arrived at the highest and most <b>permanent</b> <b>point</b> of grandeur and glory. His excessive power, his continual accessions to it, and an ambition which by words and actions declared that the whole world was not sufficient for a great man, struck a just terror into all the potentates near him: he was, indeed, arrived at that pitch of greatness, that the means of his ruin could only be found in his own family. A numerous offspring, which is generally considered as the best defence of the throne, and the support as well as ornament of declining royalty, proved on this occasion the principal part of the danger. Henry had in his lawful bed, besides daughters, four sons, Henry, Richard, Geoffrey, and John, all growing up with great hopes from their early courage and love of glory. No father was ever more delighted with these hopes, nor more tender and indulgent to his children. A custom had long prevailed in France for the reigning king to crown his eldest son in his lifetime. By this policy, in turbulent times, and whilst the principles of succession were unsettled, he secured the crown to his posterity. Henry gladly imitated a policy enforced no less by paternal affection than its utility to public peace. He had, during his troubles with Becket, crowned his son Henry, then no more than sixteen years old. But the young king, even on the day of his coronation, discovered an haughtiness which threatened not to content itself with the share of authority to which the inexperience of his youth and the nature of a provisional crown confined him. The name of a king continually reminded him that he only possessed the name. The King of France, whose daughter he had espoused, fomented a discontent which grew with his years. Geoffrey, who had married the heiress of Bretagne, on the death of her father claimed to no purpose the entire sovereignty of his wife's inheritance, which Henry, under a pretence of guardianship to a son of full age, still retained in his hands. Richard had not the same plausible pretences, but he had yet greater ambition. He contended for the Duchy of Guienne before his mother's death, which, alone could give him the color of a title to it. The queen, his mother, hurried on by her own unquiet spirit, or, as some think, stimulated by jealousy, encouraged their rebellion against her husband. The King of France, who moved all the other engines, engaged the King of Scotland, the Earl of Flanders, then a powerful prince, the Earl of Blois, and the Earl of Boulogne in the conspiracy. The barons in Bretagne, in Guienne, and even in England, were ready to take up arms in the same cause; whether it was that they perceived the uniform plan the king had pursued in order to their reduction, or were solely instigated by the natural fierceness and levity of their minds, fond of every dangerous novelty. The historians of that time seldom afford us a tolerable insight into the causes of the transactions they relate; but whatever were the causes of so extraordinary a conspiracy, it was not discovered until the moment it was ready for execution. The first token of it appeared in the young king's demand to have either England or Normandy given up to him. The refusal of this demand served as a signal to all parties to put themselves in motion. The younger Henry fled into France; Louis entered Normandy with a vast army; the barons of Bretagne under Geoffrey, and those of Guienne under Richard, rose in arms; the King of Scotland pierced into England; and the Earl of Leicester, at the head of fourteen thousand Flemings, landed in Suffolk.|$|E

The University Medical Centre Utrecht introduced the task PPC {{in the care}} pathway for pa-tients with oesophagus and pancreas in May 2011. By introducing the task <b>Permanent</b> <b>Point</b> of Contact (PPC) {{the progress of the}} care process is monitored and patients have a single point of contact. Objectives To evaluate the task PPC in the care pathway for patient with oesophagus and pancreas cancer and thereby providing opportunities for refining and improving the task. In the long run, working with a PPC aims to reduce care discontinuity for cancer patients and improve cancer care. Method A formative evaluation using mixed methods has been conducted. The quantitative part was an analysis of a data file in which PPC’s noted their activities concerning the two element of their task in the period May till November 2011. The qualitative part was support-ive to these finding and consisted of interviews with PPC’s and with other health care workers (HCW’s) to explore their experiences with the task PPC. Results Almost all patients had contact with the PPC and the care process of almost all pa-tients had been guarded. For 72 (89 %) patients 232 actions had been performed after con-tact. For 42 % of the monitored patients 58 actions had been performed. Time spent per pa-tient is 2. 5 hours, per week 7. 5 hours. PPC’s and HCW’s find the task useful, not all HCW’s were aware of the existence and possibilities of the PPC. Conclusions The task PPC is feasible to perform. It might be expanded with the possibility to answer care related questions. To determine effectiveness in further research is needed...|$|E

Here a concept that is used in civil engineering; especially survey (Geological Survey Professional Paper, Volumes 1375 – 1984, Survey marking, Cornell University, Fall 1981), to locate a point using 3 parameters is used. The method is to permanently mark a point before closure of the days survey work with which the commencement of survey can be done without hassle on any subsequent day. The <b>permanent</b> <b>point</b> will be theoretically marked with two basic parameters and one validating parameter. There can be more number of points satisfying that basic parametric condition. The basic parameters are sufficient for encryption but the third dimension parameter or validating parameter is necessary for decryption. Hence this location system is a “ 3 –d coordinate system” that is very efficient for surveys that need to cover very large areas and requires more time to complete the work.|$|E

However, nobody monitored whether this care pathway was followed properly and forestall gaps in the care pathway. Therefore, the hospital started a pilot study in May 2011 introducing the task of <b>Permanent</b> <b>Point</b> of Contact (PPC). This PPC had two subtasks: provide a clear point of contact for the patient and guard the care pathway progress. Objectives To evaluate the PPC task in the care pathway for breast cancer patients. The study thereby provides opportunities for refining and improving the task. Ultimately, working with a PPC aims to improve care continuity for cancer patients and to thereby improve cancer care. Method A formative evaluation with a mixed method design has been conducted. The quantitative part, based on a log file where the PPC recorded their activities, explores professional adherence {{with respect to the}} two tasks of the PPC. The qualitative part, based on phenomenology, consisted of semi-structured interviews with PPCs and HCWs to examine their experiences regarding the task PPC. Results The PPCs had contact with 70 % of all patients. Following on a contact, the PPCs performed 98 actions. 74 % of the actions had a logistical character. The PPCs guarded 99 % of patients’ individual progress in the care pathway. In 40 % of all cases, it turned out that one or more omissions had occurred in the care pathway progress.
