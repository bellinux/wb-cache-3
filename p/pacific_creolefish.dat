Dorsal rays IX, 19-21; anal rays III, 9-11; pectoral rays 19-23. The tail fin is strongly concave. <b>Pacific</b> <b>creolefish</b> grow to ~36 cm.|$|E

50|$|As all fish species, the <b>Pacific</b> <b>creolefish</b> {{harbours}} {{a number}} of parasites, including, off Mexico, the digeneans Prodistomum orientalis, Brachyphallus sp., Lecithochirium sp., the nematodes Anisakis sp. and Spinitectus sp., the copepods Caligus sp., and the isopods Hatschekia sp. The diplectanid monogenean Pseudorhabdosynochus jeanloui was described in 2015 from this fish off Peru.|$|E
50|$|Paranthias colonus (<b>Pacific</b> <b>creolefish)</b> is {{a species}} of grouper found in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. They are {{typically}} found in small aggregations well above reefs, but will retreat to the reef at the approach of danger. They form large midwater schools while feeding on plankton. They occur up the a depth of 100 m. They feed mainly on small planktonic animals that are picked individually from the water, made possible by their shortened snout which facilitates close-range binocular vision.|$|E
40|$|Pseudorhabdosynochus jeanloui n. sp. (Monogenoidea, Diplectanidae) is {{described}} from specimens {{collected from the}} gills of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>creolefish,</b> Paranthias colonus (Perciformes, Serranidae) from a fish market in Chorrillos, Lima, Peru. The new species is differentiated from {{other members of the}} genus by the structure of its sclerotized vagina, which has two spherical chambers of similar diameter. This is the first Pseudorhabdosynochus species described from the Pacific coast of America, the third species of the genus reported from South America and the first described from a member of Paranthias...|$|E
