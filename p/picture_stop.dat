The <b>pictures</b> <b>stop</b> spinning and {{you realize that you}} have lost the round, as well as the money you just paid to play. You decide to try again, and you lose once again. Before you know it, you have played ten rounds without any success. Would you keep playing the game after your series of losses? What thoughts or underlying beliefs would motivate your decision to continue or discontinue gambling? Would your justification to continue to play revolve around the idea that your luck is likely to change for the better? Or would you give up gambling because you are feeling like you are having a ‘bad luck day?’ The present research seeks to understand underlying cognitions that may influence patterns of gambling behavior.|$|R

Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that [...] "the <b>picture</b> never <b>stops</b> coming at you". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars (out of four) and included the film among his Great Movies list.|$|R
50|$|In Disney's Pinocchio, Blanc {{was hired}} to perform the voice of Gideon the Cat. However, Gideon {{eventually}} was decided to be a mute character (similar to Dopey from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), so all of Blanc's recorded dialogue was deleted except for a solitary hiccup, which was heard {{three times in the}} finished film. Blanc also originated the voice (and laugh) of Woody Woodpecker for the theatrical cartoons produced by Walter Lantz for Universal <b>Pictures,</b> but <b>stopped</b> voicing the character after he was signed to an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. During World War II, Blanc served as the voice of the hapless Private Snafu in various war-themed animated shorts.|$|R
5000|$|Because of the {{new sound}} films (nicknamed [...] "talkies"), plans to include a stage for {{vaudeville}} and stage shows were abandoned. Instead, a small [...] "sound stage" [...] was built {{to the back of}} the proscenium opening to house the screen and [...] "newfangled" [...] speakers. If the [...] "talkies" [...] were just a fad, the sound stage could easily be replaced with a full stage house with the usual complement of dressing rooms, proper rooms, fly space for the scenery and the like. The talking pictures soon became the norm, and, in 1932, all motion <b>picture</b> studios <b>stopped</b> making silent <b>pictures,</b> thus sounding the death knell for vaudeville and stage shows.|$|R

5000|$|In April 2010, Oh's main rival, Edurne Pasaban from Spain, who {{was also}} aiming {{to become the first}} woman to climb all {{fourteen}} eight-thousanders, weighed in on the controversy. Pasabán spoke with Oh and her team while descending Annapurna, Pasabán's thirteenth eight-thousander. After Pasabán spoke with Elizabeth Hawley upon descending, Hawley agreed to mark Oh's summit of Kangchenjunga as [...] "disputed" [...] in her Himalayan Database. [...] On April 24, Hawley explained her decision, [...] "The only picture that anyone has seen shows Miss Oh standing on bare rock. But Miss Pasabán (who was on the mountain at the same time) showed me a picture of her team on the summit, and they are standing on snow." [...] She added that [...] "of the three Sherpas that climbed with Miss Oh, two have said she did not reach the summit." [...] The latter comment apparently stems from conversations Pasabán had with said Sherpas while on Annapurna. [...] Although her data is unofficial, Hawley is considered the final arbiter on such disputes. [...] Hawley still counts the climb as valid, but plans to do further investigation. [...] Ferran Latorre, a Spanish climber, claimed that the green rope affixed to the mountain by Oh's team (visible in the <b>picture)</b> <b>stopped</b> 200 meters short of the summit. [...] Eberhard Jurgalski of 8000ers.com, a website devoted to keeping mountaineering records, said, [...] "It's all mixed up, you cannot say what is true and what's invented." [...] On April 27, 2010, Nepal Mountaineering Association president Ang Tshering said, [...] "We recognize Oh's achievement as the first woman climber to scale all the highest mountains in the world." [...] 8000ers.com also credits Oh with having completed all fourteen eight-thousanders. [...] The Nepalese government also stated that it believes Oh climbed Kangchenjunga.|$|R

40|$|Speaking is {{a complex}} natural {{behavior}} that most people master very well. Nevertheless, systematic investigation {{of the factors that}} affect adaptive control over speech production is relatively scarce. The present experiments quantified and compared inhibitory control over manual and verbal responses using the stop-signal paradigm. In tasks with only two response alternatives, verbal expressions were slower than manual responses, but the stopping latencies of hand and verbal actions were comparable. When engaged in a standard picture-naming task using a large set of <b>pictures,</b> verbal <b>stopping</b> latencies were considerably prolonged. Interestingly, stopping was slower for naming words that are less frequently used compared to words that are used more frequently. These results indicate that adaptive action control over speech production is affected by lexical processing. This notion is compatible with current theories on speech self-monitoring. Finally, stopping latencies varied with individual differences in impulsivity, indicating that specifically dysfunctional impulsivity, and not functional impulsivity, is associated with slower verbal stopping...|$|R

Participants were instructed to click on the object mentioned in the sentence. In the critical sentences, a stop-initial target (e. g., "pot") was preceded by an [s], thus causing ambiguity regarding whether the sentence refers to a stop-initial or a cluster-initial word (e. g., "spot"). Participants made fewer fixations to the target <b>pictures</b> when the <b>stop</b> and the preceding [s] were cross-spliced from the cluster-initial word than when they were spliced from a different token of the sentence containing the stop-initial word.

50|$|Tabla Beat Science was {{a musical}} group founded in 1999 by Zakir Hussain and Bill Laswell. Its style {{consists}} of a mixture of Hindustani music, Asian Underground, ambient music, drum and bass and electronica. In 2001 Karsh Kale was approached by super producer Bill Laswell {{to contribute to a}} project he was calling “Tabla Beat Science”.

50|$|The {{exclusivity}} {{of animation}} {{also resulted in}} {{the birth of a}} sister industry that was used almost exclusively for motion <b>picture</b> special effects: <b>stop</b> motion animation. In spite of their similarities, the two genres of stop-motion and hand-drawn animation rarely came together during the Golden Age of Hollywood. Stop-motion animation made a name for itself with the 1933 box-office hit King Kong, where animator Willis O'Brien defined many of the major stop motion techniques used for the next 50 years. The success of King Kong led to a number of other early special effects films, including Mighty Joe Young, which was also animated by O'Brien and helped to start the careers of several animators, including Ray Harryhausen, who came into his own in the 1950s. George Pal was the only stop-motion animator to produce a series of stop-motion animated cartoons for theatrical release, the Puppetoon series for Paramount, some of which were animated by Ray Harryhausen. Pal went on to produce several live-action special effects-laden feature films.|$|R
