40|$|We {{study the}} problem of an {{efficient}} and precise sharing analysis of (constraint) logic programs. After recognizing that neither <b>plain</b> <b>Sharing</b> nor its non-redundant (but equivalent) abstraction scale well to real programs, we consider the domain proposed by C. Fecht [11, 12]. This domain consists {{of a combination of}} Pos with a quite weak abstraction of Sharing. While verifying that this domain is truly remarkable, in terms of both precision and efficiency, we have revealed significant precision losses for several real programs. This loss concerns groundness, pair-sharing and linearity. We define a simple domain for sharing analysis that supports the implementation of several widening techniques. In particular, with this domain it is straightforward to turn Fecht's idea into a proper widening. More precise widenings are also considered. However, in spite of thorough experimentation we found that, provided Pos is included in the domain, the first widening we propose is hard to improve on. K [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Orbital {{images from}} the MESSENGER {{spacecraft}} show that ~ 27 % of Mercury's surface is covered by smooth plains, the majority (greater than 65 %) of which are interpreted to be volcanic in origin. Most smooth <b>plains</b> <b>share</b> the spectral characteristics of Mercury's northern smooth plains, suggesting they also share their magnesian alkali-basalt-like composition. A smaller fraction of smooth plains interpreted to be volcanic in nature have a lower reflectance and shallower spectral slope, suggesting more ultramafic compositions, an inference that implies high temperatures and high degrees of partial melting in magma source regions persisted {{through most of the}} duration of smooth plains formation. The knobby and hummocky plains surrounding the Caloris basin, known as Odin-type plains, occupy an additional 2 % of Mercury’s surface. The morphology of these plains and their color and stratigraphic relationships suggest that they formed as Caloris ejecta, although such an origin is in conflict with a straightforward interpretation of crater size-frequency distributions. If some fraction is volcanic, this added area would substantially increase the abundance of relatively young effusive deposits inferred to have more mafic compositions. Smooth plains are widespread on Mercury, but they are more heavily concentrated in the north and in the hemisphere surrounding Caloris. No simple relationship between plains distribution and crustal thickness or radioactive element distribution is observed. A likely volcanic origin for some older terrain on Mercury suggests that the uneven distribution of smooth plains may indicate differences in the emplacement age of large-scale volcanic deposits rather than differences in crustal formational process...|$|R

These {{systems are}} appealing, for they combine the atomicity property of transactions with a liveness property that ensures {{the commitment of}} every transaction that eventually encounters no contention.

40|$|Measurements {{of major}} element ratios {{obtained}} by the MESSENGER spacecraft using x-ray fluorescence spectra are used to calculate absolute element abundances of lavas at the surface of Mercury. We discuss calculation methods and assumptions that {{take into account the}} distribution of major elements between silicate, metal, and sulfide components and the potential occurrence of sulfide minerals under reduced conditions. These first compositional data, which represent large areas of mixed high-reflectance volcanic plains and low-reflectance materials and do not include the northern volcanic <b>plains,</b> <b>share</b> common silica- and magnesium-rich characteristics. They are most similar to terrestrial volcanic rocks known as basaltic komatiites. Two compositional groups are distinguished by {{the presence or absence of}} a clinopyroxene component. Melting experiments at one atmosphere on the average compositions of each of the two groups constrain the potential mineralogy at Mercury's surface, which should be dominated by orthopyroxene (protoenstatite and orthoenstatite), plagioclase, minor olivine if any, clinopyroxene (augite), and tridymite. The two compositional groups cannot be related to each other by any fractional crystallization process, suggesting differentiated source compositions for the two components and implying multi-stage differentiation and remelting processes for Mercury. Comparison with high-pressure phase equilibria supports partial melting at pressure < 10. kbar, in agreement with last equilibration of the melts close to the crust-mantle boundary with two different mantle lithologies (harzburgite and lherzolite). Magma ocean crystallization followed by adiabatic decompression of mantle layers during cumulate overturn and/or convection would have produced adequate conditions to explain surface compositions. The surface of Mercury is not an unmodified quenched crust of primordial bulk planetary composition. Ultramafic lavas from Mercury have high liquidus temperatures (1450 - 1350. °C) and very low viscosities, in accordance with the eruption style characterized by flooding of pre-existing impact craters by lava and absence of central volcanoes. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract — Wireless {{growth has}} been limited by the {{shortage}} of radio spectrum. While the spectrum assigned to legacy technologies remain unused, new prominent technologies such as Mesh/WiFi networks are forced to crowd into a small unlicensed band, suffering from significant interference and degraded performance. Using economic incentives, dynamic spectrum auctions redistribute spectrum to make it available to new technologies while providing financial benefits to legacy owners. In this paper, we investigate the performance of dynamic spectrum auctions under traffic dynamics. Using measured traffic traces from deployed WiFi access points, we evaluate the advantages and artifacts of dynamic auctions over <b>plain</b> channel <b>sharing,</b> and investigate the impact of bidding formats and auction intervals. Our results show that short-term dynamic auctions with traffic-aware bidding can significantly improve system throughput and provide bidders with cost-effective spectrum usage. I...|$|R
