Through ARM, {{the effect of}} the potential can now be included consistently both during and after ionisation, providing a complete picture for the effects of the long-range potential. We find that the Coulomb effects modify the ionisation dynamics in several ways, including modification of (i) the ionisation (exit) times, (ii) the initial conditions for the electron continuum dynamics, (iii) the "tunnelling angle", at which the electron "enters" the barrier, and (iv) the electron drift momentum. We derive analytical expressions for the Coulomb-corrected ionisation times, initial velocities, momentum shifts and ionisation rates in circularly <b>polarised</b> <b>fields,</b> for arbitrary angular momentum of the initial state.

We report the order dependence of characteristic enhancements or suppressions of high harmonic production in aligned samples of both molecules. The ellipticity dependent studies in CO 2 clearly show how the destructive interference can be “switched off” by increasing the degree of ellipticity and thus shifting the effective resonance condition. The presence of an elliptically <b>polarised</b> <b>field</b> leads to a tilting in the electron momentum which in turn breaks the cylindrical symmetry introducing a dependence on the azimuthal angle .

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Initially a central topic for psychology, suggestibility has been forgotten, rediscovered, evaded definition, sabotaged experimentation and persistently triggers epistemological short-circuits when interconnecting psychological questions of memory, childhood and scientificity, with concrete legal issues of child witnesses' credibility, the disclosure of sexual abuse and psychological expertise in courts of law. The {{aim of this study}} is to trace suggestibility through history, theory, research and practice, and to explore its efficacy at the intersection of psychology and law, by examining and comparing the. concrete case of child witness practice in England and Germany. Taking a transdisciplinary approach the study draws on two interrelated sources of 'data' combining historical, theoretical and research literature with the analysis of empirical data. A genealogy if theory and research is combined with the results of reflexive interviews, conducted in England and Germany with practitioners from all those professions involved in creating, applying or dealing with knowledge about child witnesses and suggestibility: judges, prosecutors, lawyers, police officers, psychologists (researchers, experts) and social workers. Drawing on the work of G. Deleuze and 1. Stengers this study shows how practical tensions around reliable witnesses, evidence and expertise merge pragmatically with theoretical movements employed to adjust the discipline, thereby causing frictions and voids. In this sense suggestibility provides a liminal resource: It transgresses disciplinary boundaries and pervades pragmatic and theoretical, global and personal, historical and actual considerations, creating voids that allow us to reconsider the pragmatics of change and to redefine the issue of critical impact, as well as to reformulate the problem of child witness practice and children's suggestibility. The study hopes to make a concrete contribution to facilitating the just prosecution of sexual abuse by adding transparency to the complex and at times unhelpfully <b>polarised</b> <b>field</b> of child witness practice. By exploring the 'pragmatics of change' the study furthermore hopes to give an unsettling and productive impetus to theoretical debates within critical approaches to psychology...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of Floquet {{calculations}} of rates of photo-detachment from a short-range three-dimensional model atom in an intense high-frequency laser field. We find that beyond a certain intensity the atom becomes progressively more stable against ionisation and that at this intensity the ATI spectrum exhibits a plateau {{of the kind that}} has recently been reported in the literature [101]. We also discuss the angular distribution of the photo- electrons and examine the special case of a laser-induced degeneracy in the frequency-intensity plane. In the Floquet method one represents the time-dependent Schrodinger equation by an infinite series of coupled time-independent equations, although in practice one must truncate these to a system of finite size. We study the consequences of this truncation by performing a series of calculations for the rate of (resonant) multiphoton detachment from a one-dimensional model atom in a laser field. We find that if the wavefunction is modified to take full account of the truncation then the number of equations which must be retained in order to obtain accurate results is significantly reduced. In performing a Floquet calculation for a real atomic system it is generally assumed that the atom remains at all times in a single diabatic Floquet state, rather than in a superposition of such states. By constructing a suitable two- state model we investigate the validity of this approximation and discuss the usefulness of the Floquet method in modelling an actual experiment. We present results for the multiphoton ionisation of H(1 s) by a monochromatic circularly <b>polarised</b> <b>field</b> and by a linearly polarised bichromatic field of commensurable frequencies. In the monochromatic case we draw qualitative comparisons with the predictions of Keldysh theory and use the concept of a propensity rule to explain why the angular distributions remain essentially perturbative at high intensities. In the bichromatic case we study the structure of the ATI spectrum and in particular the role played by a relative phase. The angular distributions are found to be strongly affected by the low- frequency field even when its intensity is too small to cause any appreciable ionisation of the system...|$|E

30|$|The {{conventional}} MRI system {{creates the}} strong magnetic field which {{turns out to}} be the short comings of the system while moving towards to the hybrid scanner system. Hence, the field cycling phenomenon involves the switching between the polarising (strong) and the read out (weak) field. This idea diminishes the need for maintaining the homogeneity of magnetic field evolved. Initially, the <b>polarising</b> <b>field</b> of strength 1  T is set on for a short duration of less than 1  s and turning it off to onset the read out field which is around one-tenth of the polarizing field during which the image is acquired (Handler et al. 2006). Thereby, the contrast of the image could be enhanced by increasing the frequency of switching between the strong and weak field. This phenomenon is employed mainly in small-animal MR scanner. It could also be used in the hybrid system of sequential PET/MRI as a notion to fit in the PET subsystem within the gap of a strong magnet (Gilbert et al. 2006). Also, the concept gets rid of optical fibres with the PMTs in scintillation crystal to reduce the loss of light due to magnetic field (Handler et al. 2006). Due to rapid switching of the magnetic field at high frequency, it tends to deteriorate the functioning of PET sub-modality (Gilbert et al. 2009).|$|R

The magnet is a one sided device akin to a large NMR-MOUSE with the additional design specification of planes of constant field strength vertical bar B(0) vertical bar parallel to the surface. There is a strong gradient G in the field strength perpendicular to these planes. As with earlier GARField magnets, the ratio G/vertical bar B(0) vertical bar is a system constant although the method of achieving this condition is substantially different.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{fundamental}} compressional (L(0, 1)) Pochhammer-Chree mode interaction with nonaxisymmetric damages in cylinders. To this end, experimental and numerical investigations of non-axisymmetric vertical cracks are considered. A non-contact magnetostrictive device is used for experimental investigations. Magnetostrictive transducers are used to generate and receive compressional guided waves. These are enabled by using an axisymmetric and longitudinal magnetic <b>polarising</b> <b>field.</b> Both, the incident and the reflected signals are acquired by the same receiver which allows a direct calculation of the reflected power flow. Different vertical cracks with various depths milled in steel cylinders are considered. The power flows are compared with those obtained by a three dimensional numerical method. This numerical method {{is based on a}} hybrid three dimensional (3 D) approach combining the classical finite element (FE) method with the semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) technique. The near field surrounding the damage is analysed with the 3 D FE method whereas transparent conditions are applied to the wave guide sections for the far field analysis. These transparent conditions are based on modal expansions on cross-sections. The SAFE technique is used to compute the eigenmodes. Eigenforces and modal power flows are post-processed on a straightforward way. First, the hybrid method is validated with published results in the literature obtained for a free-end cylinder.

An ultra-high vacuum system was designed and constructed to create a very low- background pressure. A new technique of viewport construction was developed, allowing for the fabrication of economical, high-quality windows for transmission of mid-infra-red laser radiation. The construction of a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and an optical molasses, and the subsequent characterisation, are discussed. A theory for the ac-Stark shift of atoms in a far-detuned laser field was developed. The nature of the scalar and tensorial light-shifts of the ground and first excited states of alkali atoms - the 5 s(^ 2) S 1 / 2 and 5 p(^ 2) P 3 / 2 states of Rb - has been examined. The effect of the differential light-shifts between these states on the operation of efficient laser cooling is discussed. A quasi-electrostatic dipole trap (QUEST) was formed from 50 W of CO 2 laser power (٢ = 10. 6 μm), focussed to < 100 μm. The transfer of ultra-cold atoms from the MOT and optical molasses to the QUEST have been examined. Single beam and standing wave geometries of the QUEST have been implemented, with lifetimes of many seconds.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{an account of}} two {{distinct}} experiments with a common theme, which is the technique of dc SQUID NMR. Firstly {{the application of the}} technique for broadband spectroscopy on room temperature samples is described. The motivation behind this work was to try to obtain SQUID NMR signals from liquid samples such as water and the amino acid glycine in order to demonstrate a few of the potential applications of this technique in the low field regime. These include increased frequency resolution, the possible detection of relatively small amounts of oil contamination in water samples and low field J-spectroscopy as a chemical bond detector. Measurements were performed on samples of water and oil-water mixtures on a dipper probe that provided a simple, compact shielding arrangement that uses a two-stage SQUID sensor as the front end amplier. With the introduction of a low frequency amplier and modications to the setup the SNR was increased by a factor of 4. However, the SNR became limited by flux trapping in the superconducting materials surrounding the sample, leading to the investigation of alternative materials and methods to maintain low field homogeneity at higher <b>polarising</b> <b>fields.</b> The second part describes SQUID NMR measurements on a single crystal of the heavy fermion superconductor UPt 3. Despite serious experimental and theoretical efforts, the symmetry and nature of the unconventional superconducting order parameter has not been resolved due to contradicting experiments, in particular that of the Knight shift into the superconducting state. Measurements were performed on a dilution refrigerator. A two-stage SQUID was mounted onto the fridge, a 3 He marker was implemented for accurate local field determination and an overlapping superconducting shield was made to decrease the spectrometer deadtime. NMR measurements are presented for the static field parallel to the c-axis of the crystal from 600 mK down to 400 mK in a static field of 71. 5 mT. The Knight shift is measured to decrease from - 1. 7 % in the normal state to - 1. 35 % at 400 mK. Together with the results from a Knight shift experiment at 30 degrees to the c-axis, it is argued that these results may provide evidence for the E 2 u model. Strategies for future measurements are addressed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Photon {{emission}} by {{an electron}} {{embedded in a}} strong external field of general form is studied theoretically. The external field considered is a plane wave electromagnetic field of any number of components, period and polarisation. Exact, Volkov solutions of the Dirac equation with the 4 -potential of the general external field are obtained. The photon emission is considered in the usual perturbation theory using the Volkov solutions to represent the electron. An expression for the transition probability {{of this process is}} obtained after the usual spin and polarisation sums, trace calculation and phase space integration. The final transition probability in the general case contains a single sum over contributions from external field photons and an integration over one of the phase space components. The validity of the general expression is established by considering specific external fields. Known specific analytic forms of the transition probability are obtained after substitution of the 4 -potential for a circularly polarised and constant crossed external field.
