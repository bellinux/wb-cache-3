30|$|Facing the {{difficulties}} and advantages {{as well as}} disadvantages of certain DEA model choices, extended and more detailed frameworks could be helpful to guide the user through a well-founded selection of indicators {{as well as through}} the reasonable choice of proper DEA model characteristics. They should persuade the user to adequately consider all necessary questions, which is why such frameworks should be systematically and iteratively designed. Although there are already some useful and supportive works on frameworks for DEA (see, e.g., Emrouznejad and De Witte 2010), their validity still has to be successfully approved in practice. Moreover, such frameworks need to be further developed continuously to meet the requirements of all different types of DEA applications. Particularly, adopting a generalized perspective on DEA—such as the one developed in Dyckhoff and Allen (2001) which is based on a multi-criteria production theory (Dyckhoff 2018)—may provide some more valuable advice for the further enhancement of those frameworks (see Wojcik 2018 for such an approach). This is especially true regarding more detailed insights for the systematic derivation and justification of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators,</b> a <b>topic</b> which has not been discussed sufficiently in the literature so far. Thus, under certain circumstances, the application of DEA in instances which are not directly based on a classical production process can either be facilitated and enhanced or otherwise be avoided. Until now, however, empirical evidence that DEA has really improved the practice of performance measurement and benchmarking is lacking, even in pure production contexts.|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUNDThe {{development}} of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> that enable benchmarking between organizations {{is an important}} mechanism for accountability, organizational learning, and performance improvement. In the province of Quebec (Canada), 21 rehabilitation organizations developed {{a common set of}} <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> through interorganizational collaboration. PURPOSEThe aims of this study were to describe the rehabilitation organizations' use of a common set of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> and to identify the factors influencing such use. APPROACHA qualitative survey was performed. Individual semistructured interviews were conducted with executives (n = 18) working at 16 rehabilitation organizations using a common set of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> A thematic analysis of the factors of use was performed according to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. The use of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> was categorized as purposeful, political, or passive. FINDINGSOur results showed that all organizations used the common set of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> Four factors were identified as important to all the rehabilitation organizations to explain their interest in comparative performance indicators: the need to develop their own <b>performance</b> <b>indicators,</b> the compatibility of performance information with organizational needs, complexity/simplicity of performance information, and the support offered by their common association. Sixty-three percent of rehabilitation organizations made purposeful or political use of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> Three main factors contributed to typify those organizations from the others: the perceived quality of the <b>performance</b> <b>indicators,</b> the leadership of decision makers, and the resources available.

30|$|Section “Performance {{measurement}} models” {{explained that}} performance measurement models typically distinguish different performance perspectives for which <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> should be further defined. We must, however, note that we consider performance measures, performance metrics and (key) <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> as synonyms (Dumas et al. 2013). For reasons of conciseness, this work will mainly refer to <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> without mentioning the synonyms. In {{addition to a}} name, each <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> should also have a concretization or operationalization that describes exactly how it is measured and that {{can result in a}} value to be compared against a target. For instance, regarding the example in Table  1, the qualitative statements to measure customer satisfaction constitute an operationalization. Nonetheless, different ways of operationalization can be applied to measure the same <b>performance</b> <b>indicator.</b> Since organizations can profit from reusing existing <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> and the related operationalization instead of inventing new ones (i.e., to facilitate benchmarking and save time), this work investigates which <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> are used or mentioned in the literature on business process performance and how they are operationalized.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate content validity and predictive validity of I I <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> for the rehabilitation of workers with mental health problems. Research Design and Subjects: Content validity was assessed by experts who evaluated the validity of the <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> in 2 Delphi rounds. Predictive validity was evaluated by relating the <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> and their sum score to the outcome of a cohort of 191 employees absent from work as a result of mental health problems. Scores for the <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> were obtained by processing registration forms of consultations filled out by occupational physicians. Main Outcome Measures: Three outcome measures were used: time to return to work, change in level of fatigue, and patient satisfaction. Results: Ten of the I I <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> showed adequate content validity according to the expert panel. The evaluation of predictive validity yielded mixed results. One <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> did not show sufficient variability and was excluded from further analysis. The sum score of 9 <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> and <b>performance</b> on the evaluation of work disabilities were significantly related to a shorter time to return to work (hazard ratio [HR], respectively, 0. 7; confidence interval [CI], 0. 7 - 0. 9 and 0. 5; Cl, 0. 2 - 0. 9). Adequate care regarding interventions aimed at providers of care in the curative sector was related to a longer time to return to work (HR, 1. 8; Cl, 1. 1 - 3. 0).

However, lower quality of overall care was significantly related to moderately higher patient satisfaction (P = 0. 18; P < 0. 05).

A 10 -step process was developed to enable network coordinators to identify specific <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> to help them monitor their networks. The methodology {{was based on a}} listing of surveillance activities, the definition and choice of network's global priority objectives, the construction of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> and monitoring tables and the implementation of the system within the network. This process was implemented for the bovine clinical digestive salmonellosis surveillance network in France (RESSAB). The process produced a list of 26 activities synthesized into 15 global objectives, from which 12 were retained as priority objectives. This made it possible to develop 12 <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> Indicators retrospectively calculated for the year 2003 indicated that RESSAB was operating according to the objectives set by the network's stakeholders and its financial supporter.
