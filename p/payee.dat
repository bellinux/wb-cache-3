5|$|A {{negotiable}} instrument {{is a type}} of contract that allows the transfer of money, such as a cheque. With a cheque there are three parties - the person holding the bank account who gives the cheque (the drawer), the party the cheque is made out to (the <b>payee)</b> and the drawer's bank which promises to pay the money to the <b>payee</b> (the drawee).|$|E
5|$|The <b>payee</b> endorses the {{original}} paper check and presents {{it to the}} depository financial institution.|$|E
5|$|The legal {{elements}} and {{features of the}} major federal public corruption offenses differ. The various jurisdictional elements of the offenses require that the prosecution prove, alternatively: that the <b>payee</b> was a federal official; that the <b>payee</b> organization received $10,000 in federal funds; that the corrupt communications involved {{the use of the}} mail or interstate wires; that the corruption affected interstate commerce or interstate travel. The mens rea elements differ in whether they require a quid pro quo; a mere nexus is an easier element to prove; more difficult elements to prove include the intent to be influenced and inducement. The offenses also differ in whether the act to be procured from the public official must be an official, a violation of an official duty, a fraud on the United States, or an official transaction. The offenses also differ in whether the payor may be prosecuted in addition to the public official. Finally, the offenses differ in whether they are predicates for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and money laundering prosecutions, and in the maximum authorized prison sentence that may be imposed upon conviction.|$|E

25|$|The {{banks that}} had {{originated}} the checks were keen {{to ensure the}} depository institution used by Barker had acted properly in ensuring the checks had been received and endorsed by the check's <b>payee,</b> before its acceptance for deposit in Bernard Barker's account. Only in this way would the issuing banks not {{be held liable for}} the unauthorized and improper release of funds from their customers' accounts.|$|E
25|$|Issue of money, in {{the form}} of {{banknotes}} and current accounts subject to cheque or payment at the customer's order. These claims on banks can act as money because they are negotiable or repayable on demand, and hence valued at par. They are effectively transferable by mere delivery, in the case of banknotes, or by drawing a cheque that the <b>payee</b> may bank or cash.|$|E

25|$|The first bank to {{initiate}} the permanent issue of banknotes was the Bank of England. Established in 1694 {{to raise money for}} the funding of the war against France, the bank began issuing notes in 1695 with the promise to pay the bearer the value of the note on demand. They were initially handwritten to a precise amount and issued on deposit or as a loan. There was a gradual move toward the issuance of fixed denomination notes, and by 1745, standardized printed notes ranging from £20 to £1,000 were being printed. Fully printed notes that didn't require the name of the <b>payee</b> and the cashier's signature first appeared in 1855.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{simultaneously}} with the United States, online banking {{arrived in the}} United Kingdom. The UK's first home online banking services known as Homelink {{was set up by}} Bank of Scotland for customers of the Nottingham Building Society (NBS) in 1983. The system used was based on the UK's Prestel viewlink system and used a computer, such as the BBC Micro, or keyboard (Tandata Td1400) connected to the telephone system and television set. The system allowed on-line viewing of statements, bank transfers and bill payments. In order to make bank transfers and bill payments, a written instruction giving details of the intended recipient had to be sent to the NBS who set the details up on the Homelink system. Typical recipients were gas, electricity and telephone companies and accounts with other banks. Details of payments to be made were input into the NBS system by the account holder via Prestel. A cheque was then sent by NBS to the <b>payee</b> and an advice giving details of the payment was sent to the account holder. BACS was later used to transfer the payment directly.|$|E
500|$|The {{substitute}} check must accurately {{represent all}} information depicted {{on the front}} and back of the original paper check at the time the financial institution truncates that check, including the names of the payor and <b>payee,</b> courtesy and legal amounts, endorsements, and encoding information, among other details.|$|E

50|$|<b>Payees</b> use the {{information}} provided on the 1099 forms to help them complete their own tax returns. In order to save paper, payers can give <b>payees</b> one single Combined Form 1099 that lists all of their 1099 transactions for the entire year. Taxpayers are usually not required to attach Form 1099s to their own Federal income tax returns unless the Form 1099 includes a report for Federal income tax withheld by the payer from the related payments.|$|R
50|$|<b>Payees</b> {{receiving}} Form 1099-MISC for rents and royalties usually need to fill Schedule E (amount {{from this}} will go to line 17 of Form 1040).|$|R
2500|$|Applying {{the facts}} to the case, {{the court held that}} (1) the mistake of the bank in {{overlooking}} the instruction to stop the cheque caused the payment; that (2) as the bank was acting without mandate, no obligation of the Association to the <b>payee</b> was discharge, and it follows from this that the <b>payee</b> gave no consideration to the bank for payment; (3) {{there was no evidence of}} any change of position by the recipient. [...] Accordingly, the court ordered that the sums be repaid to the bank.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Goff J {{noted that}} a bank which pays a cheque drawn or purportedly drawn by a {{customer}} without a mandate is paying without mandate, and cannot debit the customer's account. [...] In such cases, the bank has paid out its own money. [...] However, the bank is entitled to recover the mistaken payment unless the <b>payee</b> has changed his position in good faith. [...] But if the payment had been within the customer's mandate (i.e. the mistake of fact had been related to something else entirely) {{there could be no}} recovery, as the payment would discharge the customer's debt to the <b>payee.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The judge then {{reviewed}} the various cases suggesting that where a <b>payee</b> has changed {{their position in}} good faith in reliance upon the payment, {{they should not be}} required to repay sums where it would be inequitable to do so. [...] Noting a number of technical rules which had evolved in the judgments, Robert Goff J confined himself to saying [...] "if, in due course, full recognition is given to the defence of change of position, there will be no further need for any such stringent rule and the law can be reformulated on a more rational and less technical basis." ...|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} alleged that annuity issuers will not address {{questions}} of <b>payees</b> whose payments {{are subject to}} a servicing agreement. Some factoring industry commentators suggest {{the reason for this}} phenomenon is that some structured annuity issuers will not [...] "split" [...] annuity payments (i.e. make payments to more than one place)ostensibly to save administrative cost. Others say that the practice is driven by the factoring companies simply as a means to secure new business. Several industry commentators have expressed concerns questioned whether such servicing agreements are in the structured settlement <b>payee's</b> [...] "best interest".|$|R
2500|$|The {{decision}} was also subject to limited academic criticism, including a strongly worded article by Professor Roy Goode in the Law Quarterly Review. [...] Goode {{argued that the}} case was wrongly decided for three reasons: first, although the bank lacked express authority to pay on the cheque, it had implied authority; secondly, that the <b>payee</b> had changed their position and so {{should have had a}} good defence in law; and thirdly (although slightly speculatively) the better solution would be to treat the payment as discharging the debt of the customer and for the bank to be able to reclaim the sums from the customer under the doctrine of subrogation. [...] Goode's criticisms of the decision have not been broadly accepted, either by commentators on the law of restitution, or on banking law.|$|E
2500|$|Under U.S. tax law, U.S. persons (regardless {{of country}} of residence) are {{generally}} {{required to report}} and pay U.S. federal income tax on income from all sources. The U.S. is unique in taxing not only non-resident citizens but also non-resident [...] "U.S. Persons for tax purposes". The law requires U.S. citizens living abroad to pay U.S. taxes on foreign income if the foreign tax should be less than U.S. tax ("taxing up"), independently within each category of earned income and passive income. For this reason, the increased reporting requirements of FATCA have had extensive implications for U.S. citizens living abroad. Taxpayer identification numbers and source withholding are also now used to enforce asset reporting requirements upon non-resident U.S. citizens. For example, mandatory withholding can be required via FATCA when a U.S. payor cannot confirm the non-U.S. status of a foreign <b>payee.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As {{proprietor}} of the playhouse, Lyly installed Evans as {{the manager of the}} new company of Oxford's Boys, composed of the Children of the Chapel and the Children of Paul's, and turned his talents to play writing. Lyly's Campaspe was performed at Blackfriars [...] and subsequently at Court on New Year's Day 1584; likewise, his Sapho and Phao was produced first at Blackfriars on Shrove Tuesday and then at court on 3 March, with Lyly listed as the <b>payee</b> for both Court appearances. In November 1583, Hunnis, still Master of the Chapel Children, successfully petitioned the Queen to increase the stipend to house, feed, and clothe the company. More finally obtained a legal judgement voiding the original lease at the end of Easter Term (June) of 1584, thereby ending the First Blackfriars Playhouse after eight years and postponing the performance of Lyly's third play, Gallathea.|$|E
