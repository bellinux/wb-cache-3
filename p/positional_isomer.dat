500|$|Amphetamine {{belongs to}} the phenethylamine class. It is also the parent {{compound}} of its own structural class, the substituted amphetamines, which includes prominent substances such as bupropion, cathinone, MDMA, and methamphetamine. As {{a member of the}} phenethylamine class, amphetamine is also chemically related to the naturally occurring trace amine neuromodulators, specifically phenethylamine and , both of which are produced within the human body.

500|$|The two {{amphetamine}} enantiomers that compose Adderall (i.e., levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine) {{alleviate the}} symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy by increasing {{the activity of the}} neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain, which results in part from their interactions with trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in neurons. [...] Dextroamphetamine is a more potent [...] stimulant than levoamphetamine, but levoamphetamine has slightly stronger cardiovascular and peripheral effects and a longer elimination half-life (i.e., it remains in the body longer) than dextroamphetamine. The levoamphetamine component of Adderall has been reported to improve the treatment response in some individuals relative to dextroamphetamine alone. Adderall's active ingredient, amphetamine, shares many chemical and pharmacological properties with the human trace amines, particularly phenethylamine and , the latter of which is a <b>positional</b> <b>isomer</b> of amphetamine.|$|E

40|$|Four {{isomeric}} sugar methylglycosides (alpha- and beta-D-gluco- and galactopyranosides) {{were evaluated}} as rubidium cation coordination adducts {{in the gas}} phase using variable-wavelength multiple-photon dissociation {{in the range from}} 2750 to 3750 cm(- 1). The adducts dissociated following photon absorption to yield neutral sugars and the rubidium cation, resulting in infrared "action" spectra. Well-resolved hydroxyl stretching bands clearly differentiate stereoisomers that vary solely in their asymmetry at single carbons. Density functional theory calculations of the lowest-energy gas-phase complexes indicate that rubidium coordinates with lone pairs of oxygen atoms as either bi- or tridentate complexes and that more than one <b>positional</b> coordination <b>isomer</b> could adequately account for most of the O-H stretch frequencies observed for each methylglycoside...|$|R

40|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} (MS) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and most trusted analytical methods for chemical identification. Advances in biology, such as metabolic analysis and proteomics, have fueled a growing number of refinements in this method. Unfortunately, isomers, for example, o- and p-xylene, are seldom identifiable by MS because they produce identical spectra. Time-consuming and less sensitive multidimensional methods are subsequently required for structural determination. The sensitivity of MS coupled with shaped femtosecond laser pulses that control molecular fragmentation and ionization results in a new, fast, and reproducible method for molecular identification which is used here to distinguish <b>positional</b> and geometric <b>isomer</b> compounds and quantify their relative concentration in mixtures. Standard mass spectrometry (MS) uses an electron gun to cause electron impact ionization of the analyte. In most cases, this method of ionization is not capable of showing sufficient differences to be used for reliable isomer identification. For subsecond trace analysis of compounds such as isomeric species in mixtures, simple solutions such as gas chromatography (GC) -MS are not acceptable. The pursuit of laser-based molecula...|$|R
40|$|A model {{explaining}} quantal Ca 2 ~ release as {{an intrinsic}} {{property of the}} inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) receptor has been put forward. The model {{is based on the}} hypothesis that the IP 3 receptor can catalyze a transformation f the IP 3 molecule differing from its conventional metabolism. A simple kinetic mechanism is considered, in-which IP 3 -induced Ca 2 § channel opening is followed by the step of IP 3 conversion and channel closure. Examination of the resulting mathematical model shows that it can reproduce well both partial release of stored Ca 2 ~ and the same responsiveness to subsequent IP 3 additions. On incorporation of an additional closed state of the channel, the model describes also a time-dependent channel inactivation at a high IP 3 dose. Temperature s nsitivity of the catalytic step accounts for the reported elimination of quantal responses and inactivation at low temperature. The transformation product is surmised to be a <b>positional</b> or stereo <b>isomer</b> of IP 3.

40|$|Trans {{vaccenic acid}} (TVA; trans- 11 18 : 1) is a <b>positional</b> and {{geometric}} <b>isomer</b> of oleic acid {{and it is}} the predominant trans isomer found in ruminant fats. TVA can be converted into cis- 9, trans- 11 conjugated linoleic acid (c 9, t 11 -CLA), a CLA isomer that has many beneficial effects, by stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD 1) in the mammary gland. The health benefits associated with CLA are well documented, but it is unclear whether trans fatty acids (TFAs) from ruminant products have healthy effects. Therefore, the effects of TVA on the proliferation of MCF- 7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells and MCF- 10 A human breast epithelial cells were investigated in the present study. Results showed that TVA inhibited the proliferation of MCF- 7 cells but not MCF- 10 A cells by down-regulating the expression of Bcl- 2 as well as procaspase- 9. In addition, the suppressive effect of TVA was confirmed in SCD 1 -depleted MCF- 7 cells. Our results suggested that TVA exerts a direct anti-carcinogenic effect on MCF- 7 cells. These findings provided {{a better understanding of the}} research on the anti-carcinogenic effects of TVA and this may facilitate the manufacture of TVA/c 9, t 11 -CLA fortified ruminant products...|$|R
40|$|Most {{phospholipids}} {{found in}} biological membranes are mixed-acid phospholipids. Yet {{there is little}} known about the physical properties of mixed-acid phospholipids in bilayers. In this work positional isomers were synthesized using modifications of published procedures. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to study the thermotropic properties of aqueous dispersions of l-oleoyl- 2 -palmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (OPPC), l-palmitoyl- 2 oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (POPC), l-oleoyl- 2 -stearoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (OSPC), l-stearoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (SOPC), l-oleoyl- 2 -arachidoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (OAPC), and l-arachidoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (AOPC). The gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition temperatures of these lecithins were different from each other, and {{from those of the}} parent single-acid lecithins. For each pair of <b>positional</b> isomers the <b>isomer</b> with the longer chain at the sn-l position had the lower transition temperature. – The thermotropic behavior of mixtures of cholesterol with four mixed-acid lecithins and three single-acid lecithins was studied using differential scanning calorimetry. Asymmetric endotherms were observed, and these were resolved into a narrow and a broad component. The narrow components disappeared at different levels of cholesterol for the different lecithins. The results suggested that for the OSPC-SOPC pair, cholesterol interacted more with OSPC than with SOPC. For the OAPC-AOPC pair, the interaction was greater between AOPC and cholesterol than between OAPC and cholesterol. Structural differences in the hydrocarbon region of the lecithin bilayers may account for these observations. – Phase diagrams were constructed for mixtures of 1, 2 -dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DPPC) and 1, 2 -dimyristoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DMPC) with some mixed-acid lecithins. The phase diagrams were analyzed using Regular Solution Theory, and excess interaction energies were obtained. – Gel phase immiscibility was observed in the mixtures of DPPC with OPOC and with SOPC, but not in mixtures of DMPC with POPC or with l-palmitoyl- 2 -stearoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine. The miscibility in the gel phase appeared {{to be related to the}} transition temperatures of the lipids. In the liquid-crystal there was complete miscibility in all four mixtures. The estimates of excess interaction energies suggested that transient clusters of like molecules in the liquid-crystal may occur. Computer simulations based on excess interaction energies were also presented...|$|R
