We report {{a case of a}} Mycoplasma haemofelis– like infection in an HIV-positive patient co-infected with Bartonella henselae. Hemoplasmas are a group of bacteria that infect animals. They are small epicellular parasites that adhere to the host’s erythrocytes. Diseases caused by these bacteria range from acute hemolytic anemia to asymptomatic infection. It is generally thought that most Mycoplasma spp. are host specific. However, there are occasional reports of infection in an animal species not perceived as primary hosts. These infections may have a <b>pathologic</b> <b>effect,</b> particularly when predisposing conditions, such as immunodeficiency, are present (1).

40|$|Polystyrene microspheres, {{the size}} chosen to plug {{capillaries}} and precapillaries, were {{injected into the}} arterial supply of rat sciatic nerves. They produced widespread segmental occlusion of capillaries in lower limb nerves. The clinical and <b>pathologic</b> <b>effect</b> was dose-related. One million microspheres produced selective capillary occlusion but no nerve fiber degeneration; approximately 6 million microspheres also produced selective capillary occlusion and associated foot and leg weakness, sensory loss, and fiber degeneration, beginning in a central core of the distal sciatic nerve; 30 million microspheres caused both capillary and arterial occlusion and a greater neuropathologic deficit. From these observations it is inferred that 1) occlusion of isolated precapillaries and capillaries does not produce ischemic fiber degeneration; 2) occlusion of many microvessels results in central fascicular fiber degeneration, indicating that these cores are watershed regions of poor perfusion; and 3) stereotyped pathologic alterations of nerve fibers and Schwann cells are related to dose, anatomic site, and time elapsed since injection...|$|E
40|$|Brush {{borders and}} plasma {{membranes}} have been purified from mucosal epithelial cells of rabbit ileum under control conditions and after treatment for 3 hr with cholera toxin in vivo. The activity of several enzymes in these preparations was measured. It {{was concluded that}} adenyl cyclase, like NaK-ATPase, seems {{not to be a}} normal constituent of brush borders. Both these enzymes are present in plasma membrane preparations derived largely from the basal and lateral margins of the epithelial cells, both may be phospholipid dependent enzymes and both are affected by cholera toxin. Adenyl cyclase activity is increased while NaK-ATPase is decreased. The activities of alkaline phosphatase, leucineaminopeptidase, 5 ′-nucleotidase, glucose- 6 -phosphatase, and Mg-ATPase were not found to be affected by the toxin.

Our use of Ad 4 -HIV E 3 -deleted (ΔE 3) recombinants as vaccines necessitates further examination of these viruses for enhanced pathogenesis. Equivalent infectious doses of Ad 4 wild-type (Ad 4 WT), Ad 4 ΔE 3, and two recombinants: Ad 4 ΔE 3 HIVenv and Ad 4 ΔE 3 HIVgag, were inoculated intranasally into cotton rats.

40|$|Mammalian {{reovirus}} type 3 binds to a 67 -kD surface glycoprotein on {{the membrane}} of neuronal cells. This interaction initiates the infective reovirus cycle. The physiological function of this virus receptor is not known, however, initial studies illustrate a striking structural and antigenic homology to the beta adrenergic receptor family. The earliest known <b>pathologic</b> <b>effect</b> of reovirus type 3 is an inhibition of host cell DNA synthesis within 8 - 10 h after virus attachment.

Methods 13 cases from 4 unrelated Portuguese families were selected, in which one or more hearing-impaired members had Met 34 Thr variant. ResultsMet 34 Thr variant was identified in 11 / 13 cases. Two cases have an additional mutation – Val 153 Ile and 35 delG. Hearing loss was mild in 2 patients (Met 34 Thr/Val 153 Ile; Met 34 Thr/Met 34 Thr), moderate in 3 (Met 34 Thr/WT; Met 34 Thr/ 35 delG; Met 34 Thr/Met 34 Thr), severe in 2 (2 Met 34 Thr/WT) and profound in 1 (Met 34 Thr/WT).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cerebral {{autosomal}} dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), {{which leads to}} strokes and dementia, is caused by single missense mutations or, in a few cases, small deletions in the NOTCH 3 gene. These mutations result in a gain or a loss of 1 (or, rarely, 3) cysteine residue in 1 of 34 epidermal growth factor-like repeats in the extracellular amino-terminal region of NOTCH 3. OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient with a novel NOTCH 3 mutation in whom clinical and laboratory findings of mitochondrial abnormalities were associated with a diagnosis of CADASIL. Patient A patient {{with a history of}} migraines, repeated transient ischemic attacks, and generalized fatigue underwent muscle biopsy, brain magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, and screening of mitochondrial DNA and NOTCH 3. RESULTS: Molecular genetic analysis showed a NOTCH 3 mutation (the first documented frameshift deletion in a patient with CADASIL) in exon 4. Although the screening of mitochondrial DNA did not show mitochondrial mutations, findings from muscle biopsy and brain magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging showed signs of mitochondrial impairment (ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities and increased parenchymal brain lactate, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A patient with CADASIL and a 5 -base pair deletion leading to a frameshift mutation showed clinical and laboratory evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction. This adds to the previously reported hypothesis of a pathogenetic role of NOTCH 3 or, less specifically, a microvascular <b>pathologic</b> <b>effect</b> on mitochondrial energy metabolism...|$|E

Besides the cytopathic effects (CPE) and tissue damage, inflammation is also a significant <b>pathologic</b> <b>effect</b> mediated by Emuc, reminiscent of the excessive inflammation during EBOV infection in clinic (Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011; Baize et al., 2002; Cilloniz et al., 2011) and the capacity of GP 1, 2 and shed GP (both containing Emuc) to activate inflammatory reaction of immune cells in vitro (Ning et al., 2017). As shown in Figure  1 I, many muscle fibers which seemed not to be infected by ADV-Emuc-TVA but were infiltrated by the inflammatory cells were damaged as well, suggesting that Emuc-mediated inflammation also plays important roles in the cell and tissue injury. Taken together, we consider that the tissue lesion could be mediated directly by the cytotoxicity of Emuc and indirectly by the host inflammatory responses triggered by Emuc although it remains undefined to what extents the two effects of Emuc, respectively, contribute to the tissue damage. Additionally, tissue injury and inflammation can trigger and promote each other under the physiological conditions.

To fully capitalize on these immittance measures for pediatric hearing care, developmental and <b>pathologic</b> <b>effects</b> {{need to be}} fully understood. Published literature on wideband immittance (reflectance, absorbance, tympanometry, and acoustic reflexes) is reviewed in this article to determine <b>pathologic</b> <b>effects</b> in newborns, infants, and children relative to standard audiologic tests such as otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), standard tympanometry, air and bone conduction auditory brainstem response, and otoscopy. Infants and children with surgically confirmed otitis media with effusion have lower absorbance in the mid-frequency range (1 to 3 kHz) for the affected ear(s). Newborns that do not pass OAE screening at birth also have lower absorbance for frequencies from 1 to 3 kHz, suggesting that nonpass results are frequently associated with middle ear issues at birth. In Newborn Hearing Screening Programs, WAI may help to interpret hearing screening results. Conclusions are limited {{by the fact that}} the true status of the middle ear and cochlea are not known for newborns and infants in studies that use OAE or tympanometry as the reference standard. Likelihood ratios for reflectance against surgery gold standards range from diagnostically suggestive to informative.

Being exposed to the occupations related to metals such as working in the mines, industries and chemical fertilizers in agriculture may cause manganism. Chelating agents have been used successfully in the treatment of severe manganism. This study was conducted to explore the capability of Para Amino Salicylic acid (PAS) in reducing Mn concentrations in body fluids and tissues of mn-exposed animals. Methods: Twenty vistar male rats (260 - 280 g) were divided into four groups (control, Mn, PAS, Mn+PAS takers). Mn animals received i. p. 8 mg/kg manganese chloride for one week as intoxication and PAS was injected by 1 cc of 1. 5 g/l PAS for four weeks as the treatment. Serum, urine and kidney tissue of animals were collected for biochemical and histopathological evaluation. Results: Mn exposure significantly increased the concentration of Mn in serum and urine (p< 0. 001) as well as in kidney extract(p< 0. 05). Following PAS treatment, Mn levels in serum and kidney extract reduced, whereas in urine increased. Serum urea (P< 0. 05) level increasing in all test groups indicated kidney destruction in them. Higher levels of cystatin C in PAS group animals serum (p< 0. 01) revealed side effects on kidneys that was treated by Mn consumption. Lowering the blood and protein occurrence in urine of animals that received Mn+PAS indicated the therapeutic effects of PAS. Benefits of PAS consumption was clear in histological assays especially in the kidney cortex.

40|$|When the {{developing}} brain {{is exposed to}} alcohol, neuronal death is a prominent <b>pathologic</b> <b>effect.</b> This loss of neurons may underlie many of the behavioral deficits observed in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Previous studies using whole animals and cultured neurons have demonstrated that the vulnerability of neurons to alcohol-induced death changes with development and can diminish markedly {{over the course of}} several days. This study examined the possibility that developmental stage-dependent alcohol resistance depends on a unique signaling pathway involving nitric oxide (NO), the NO-cyclic GMP (cGMP) -cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) pathway. Cerebellar granule neuron (CGN) cultures were established from neonatal rats. The cultures were exposed to alcohol (400 mg/dl) either when they were newly established (1 day in vitro, 1 -DIV) or when they were more mature (4 days in vitro, 4 -DIV). Viable neurons were quantified 24 h later. Although both 1 -DIV and 4 -DIV cultures were exposed to alcohol for an identical length of time (24 h), the 1 -DIV cultures were much more vulnerable to alcohol-induced neuronal death (22. 9 % neuronal loss) than the 4 -DIV cultures (2. 3 % neuronal loss). Thus, the cultures have a developmental stage-dependent alcohol resistance. To determine the role of the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway in this developmental stage-dependent alcohol resistance, the CGN cultures at 4 -DIV were exposed to agents that either activated or inhibited the pathway, either in the presence or in the absence of alcohol. Inhibition of the pathway at its first step with N(G) -nitro-l-arginine-methyl ester (NAME) or at its second step with LY 83583 converted the 4 -DIV cultures from alcohol resistant to alcohol sensitive. Alcohol-induced neuronal losses were as severe in the 4 -DIV cultures treated with pathway inhibitors as they were in the 1 -DIV cultures. Treatment of the CGN cultures with agents that activate the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway reduced background cell death, and this neurotrophic effect was not inhibited by the presence of alcohol. Furthermore, activation of the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway at sites downstream from sites of pathway inhibition restored alcohol resistance. Thus, the developmental stage-dependent alcohol resistance acquired by CGN cultures depends on a functional NO-cGMP-PKG pathway...|$|E

While predictable hormonal changes accompany commencement of menopause, several disease states are associated with ovarian dysfunction. These diseases include polycystic ovarian syndrome and hyperthecosis, both associated with androgenization. Ovarian tumors may also be associated with morphological and clinical alterations. While endocrinologically inert ovarian tumors are associated with morphologic evidence of stromal activation, endocrinologically active ovarian tumors may cause differentiation along either male or female lines {{as a consequence of}} differential productions of androgens and estrogens...|$|R
40|$|L-Tryptophan (L-TRP) is a nutritionally {{essential}} {{amino acid}} and the kynurenine (KYN) pathway is the major route of L-TRP catabolism. Besides being synthesized for proteins, L-TRP and its metabolites have critical roles for the functions of nervous and immune systems. Many researches show that optimal amounts of L-TRP in diets depend on species, developmental stages, environmental factors and health status. We have shown that KYN pathway-related enzyme activities vary among species, tissue and cell types in physiological conditions. Furthermore, the response of these enzyme activities to systemic and/or central nervous system immune activation and inflammation depends on species and cell types. Thus, {{it is very important}} to choose appropriate animal species and cell types in which to evaluate the physiologic and <b>pathologic</b> <b>effects</b> of increased KYN pathway metabolism. We believe that understanding L-TRP metabolism among species and cell types provides a better idea for analysis of human pathological condition...|$|R
40|$|Background: More {{than one}} million new cases of sexually {{transmitted}} diseases (STDs) occur each day. The immune responses and inflammation induced by STDs and other frequent non-STD microbial colonizations (i. e. Candida and bacterial vaginosis) can have serious pathologic consequences in women including adverse pregnancy outcomes, infertility and increased susceptibility to infection by other pathogens. Understanding the types of immune mediators that are elicited in the lower genital tract by these infections/colonizations can give important insights into the innate and adaptive immune pathways that are activated and lead to strategies for preventing <b>pathologic</b> <b>effects.</b> Methodology/Principal Findings: 32 immune mediators were measured by multiplexed immunoassays to assess the immune environment of the lower genital tract mucosa in 84 women attending an urban STD clinic. IL- 3, IL- 1 ß, VEGF, angiogenin, IL- 8, ß 2 Defensin and ß 3 Defensin were detected in all subjects, Interferon-a was detected in none, while th...|$|R
40|$|Infection with "pathogenic " {{microorganisms}} {{but without}} clinically apparent disease has been variously defined as latent, subclinical, dormant, occult, and inapparent. These terms are employed with varying meanings by clinicians, veterinarians, phytopathologists, and other biologists. For {{the sake of}} greater consistency, however, three general categories of infections without apparent disease have been proposed, defined, and broadly grouped under the term "attenuated infection " (1). These three categories are the carrier state, microbial persistence, and latent infection. Infection is herein defined {{as the presence of}} microorganisms within or upon tissues {{regardless of whether or not}} this results in detectable <b>pathologic</b> <b>effects.</b> The carrier state is that variant of attenuated infection characterized by a continuing infection with agents which are easily recoverable and recognizable. The infecting agents can be recovered from the host by means of the usual standard techniques. They can not be distinguished morphologically, physiologically, or biochemically from other members of the species isolated from instances of infectious disease or naturally occurrin...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{therapists}} commonly {{treat people}} with diabetes {{for a wide variety}} of diabetes-associated impairments, including those from diabetes-related vascular disease. Diabetes is associated with both microvascular and macrovascular diseases affecting several organs, including muscle, skin, heart, brain, and kidneys. A common etiology links the different types of diabetes-associated vascular disease. Common risk factors for vascular disease in {{people with diabetes}}, specifically type 2 diabetes, include hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, tobacco use, and obesity. Mechanisms for vascular disease in diabetes include the <b>pathologic</b> <b>effects</b> of advanced glycation end product accumulation, impaired vasodilatory response attributable to nitric oxide inhibition, smooth muscle cell dysfunction, overproduction of endothelial growth factors, chronic inflammation, hemodynamic dysregulation, impaired fibrinolytic ability, and enhanced platelet aggregation. It is becoming increasingly important for physical therapists to be aware of diabetes-related vascular complications as more patients present with insulin resistance and diabetes. The opportunities for effective physical therapy interventions (such as exercise) are significant...|$|R
