5|$|Like Nasser, Gaddafi favoured the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat and his group, Fatah, {{over more}} militant and Marxist Palestinian groups. As the years progressed however, Gaddafi's {{relationship}} with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate {{and calling for}} more violent action. Instead he supported militias like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, As-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization. He funded the Black September Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany, and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.|$|E
25|$|Palestinians {{view the}} Second Intifada {{as part of}} their ongoing {{struggle}} for national liberation and an end to Israeli occupation, whereas many Israelis consider it to be a wave of Palestinian terrorism instigated and pre-planned by then <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat.|$|E
25|$|After {{the suicide}} bombing, Palestinian {{university}} {{students at the}} An-Najah University in the West Bank city of Nablus created an exhibition celebrating {{the first anniversary of}} the Second Intifada. The exhibit’s main attraction was a room-sized re-enactment of the bombing at Sbarro. The installation featured broken furniture splattered with fake blood and human body parts. The entrance to the exhibition was illustrated with a mural depicting the bombing. The exhibit was later shut down by <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat.|$|E
5000|$|Yusef Urabi (also spelled Yusuf Orabi) was a Palestinian {{officer in}} the Syrian Army {{as well as an}} early member of Fatah's armed wing, al-Assifa. In 1966 he was killed in the Yarmouk Camp in Damascus during an attempt to ease {{tensions}} between <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat and Ahmed Jibril.|$|R
50|$|In April 2004 he was {{a member}} of a Gush Shalom {{delegation}} who visited <b>Palestinian</b> National Authority <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat at his headquarters in Ramallah to protest at what they claim was an Ariel Sharon, Israel's prime minister, threat against Arafat's life.|$|R
50|$|Although Matza {{retained}} {{his seat}} in the 1999 elections, Likud were defeated by Ehud Barak's One Israel alliance. Barak involvement in discussions with <b>Palestinian</b> Authority <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat over the division of Jerusalem led to Matza (then chairman of the Internal Affairs and Environment Committee) submitting a bill to amend the Jerusalem Law. The bill, which passed {{with the approval of}} 84 out of 120 Knesset members, stipulated that no decisions changing the status of Jerusalem could be made without majority consent.|$|R
500|$|Abnormally high {{concentrations}} of 210Po were detected in July 2012 in clothes and personal belongings of the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat, a heavy smoker, who died on 11 November 2004 of uncertain causes. The spokesman for the Institut de Radiophysique in Lausanne, Switzerland, where those items were analyzed, stressed that the [...] "clinical symptoms described in Arafat's medical reports were not consistent with polonium-210 and that conclusions could not be drawn {{as to whether the}} Palestinian leader was poisoned or not", and that [...] "the only way to confirm the findings would be to exhume Arafat's body to test it for polonium-210." [...] On 27 November 2012 Arafat's body was exhumed, and samples were taken for separate analysis by experts from France, Switzerland and Russia. On 12 October 2013, The Lancet published the group's finding that high levels of the element were found in Arafat's blood, urine, and in saliva stains on his clothes and toothbrush. The French tests later found some polonium but stated it was from [...] "natural environmental origin". Following later Russian tests, Vladimir Uiba, the head of the Russian Federal Medical and Biological Agency, stated in December 2013 that Arafat died of natural causes, and they had no plans to conduct further tests.|$|E

2500|$|Fischer {{has been}} criticized for {{attending}} a 1969 conference of the Palestine Liberation Organization, where <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat called for an all-out war on Israel [...] "until the end".|$|E
2500|$|Drosnin {{also made}} a number of claims and alleged {{predictions}} that have since failed. Among the most important, Drosnin clearly states in his book [...] "The Bible Code II", published on December 2, 2002, that there was to be a World War involving an [...] "Atomic Holocaust" [...] that would allegedly {{be the end of the}} world. Another claim Drosnin makes in [...] "The Bible Code II" [...] is that the nation of Libya would develop weapons of mass destruction that they would then be given to terrorists who would then use them to attack the West (specifically the United States). In reality Libya improved relations with the West in 2003 and gave up all their existing weapons of mass destruction programs. A final claim Drosnin made in [...] "The Bible Code II" [...] was that <b>Palestinian</b> Authority <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat would allegedly be assassinated by being shot to death by gunmen which Drosnin specifically stated would be from the Palestinian Hamas movement. This prediction by Drosnin also failed, as Yasser Arafat died on November 11, 2004 of what was later declared to be natural causes (specifically a stroke brought on by an unknown infection). The only conspiracy theories about Yasser Arafat allegedly being murdered have been made by a few Palestinian figures, and have involved alleged poisoning that was supposed to have been on the orders of Israeli officials. The only alleged Palestinian collaboration in this conspiracy theory involve two leading Palestinian figures from the Palestinian Fatah movement; those are current Palestinian Authority and Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas and Mohammed Dahlan the former head of Fatah in Gaza. Writer Randy Ingermanson criticized Drosnin by stating that; [...] "And that's all they are, even for Drosnin – possibilities. He believes that the future is not fixed, and that the Bible code predicts all possible outcomes. Which makes it not much of a predictive tool, but again, he seems not to mind this very much. If you are laying bets based on Drosnin, you had better be willing to bet on all possible outcomes." ...|$|R

2500|$|During the {{fighting}} several incidents of looting took place: a crowd took furniture, wall tiles and personal belongings from the villa of the by now deceased <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat; {{the home of}} former Fatah commander Mohammed Dahlan was also looted: [...] "An AFP correspondent witnessed dozens of Palestinians taking everything they could carry from Dahlan's villa – furniture, pot plants and even the kitchen sink, complete with plumbing fixtures such as taps,"; and at the Muntada, Abbas's seafront presidential compound, witnesses reported seeing Hamas fighters remove computers, documents and guns.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, the Palestinian {{delegation}} to the Madrid International Peace Conference included many notables from Ramallah. As the Intifada wound down and the peace process moved forward, normal life in Ramallah resumed. On September 13, 1993 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat shook hands at {{a meeting at the}} White House. Schoolchildren in Ramallah handed out olive branches to Israeli soldiers patrolling the streets. In December 1995, in keeping with the Oslo Accords, the Israeli army abandoned the Mukataa and withdrew to the city outskirts. The newly established Palestinian Authority assumed civilian and security responsibility for the city, which was designated [...] "Area A" [...] under the accords.|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} {{for the first}} film was mostly positive. The Hollywood Reporter praised Yasser Arafat as being [...] "an engrossingly edited, celebratory view of PLO <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat’s personal sacrifices during his political career".|$|R

2500|$|In 1992, Rabin was re-elected {{as prime}} {{minister}} on a platform embracing the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. He signed several historic agreements with the Palestinian leadership {{as part of the}} Oslo Accords. [...] In 1994, Rabin won the Nobel Peace Prize together with long-time political rival Shimon Peres and <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat. Rabin also signed a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994. In November 1995, he was assassinated by an extremist named Yigal Amir, who opposed the terms of the Oslo Accords. Rabin was the first native-born prime minister of Israel, the only prime minister to be assassinated and the second to die in office after Levi Eshkol. Rabin has become a symbol of the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.|$|E
2500|$|After Israel {{took over}} the West Bank and Gaza {{following}} the 1967 Six-Day War, some American blacks supported the Palestinians and criticized Israel's actions, for example by publicly supporting <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader</b> <b>Yasser</b> Arafat and calling {{for the destruction of}} the Jewish state. Immediately after the war, the editor of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee's (SNCC) newsletter wrote an article criticizing Israel, and asserting that the war was an effort to regain Palestinian land and that during the 1948 war, [...] "Zionists conquered the Arab homes and land through terror, force, and massacres". This article led to conflict between Jews and the SNCC, but black SNCC leaders treated the war as a [...] "test of their willingness to demonstrate SNCC's break from its civil rights past".|$|E
