Commonly, biofilm reactors are modeled as a single continuously stirred biofilm reactor (CSBR), or {{as a series of}} such.

A CSBR consists of a stirred tank, which the bulk water flows through, and from which substrates diffuse into a biofilm where they may be transformed into new substances by bacteria living in the biofilm. Here, standard assumptions are used to derive a general and flexible dynamic model of CSBR-systems, where the reaction kinetics are of zero or first order.

The parameters necessary for the SSS analysis are self generated using a Software program. SSS is capable of carrying out Eigenvalue analysis.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the {{evaluation}} of radiation effects in detectors based on p-type magnetic czochralski (MCz) Si that was converted to n-type by thermal donor (TD) introduction. As-processed p+-p-n+ detectors were annealed at 430 °C resulting in p+-n(TD) -n+ structures. The space charge sign and the electric field distribution E(x) in MCz Si p+-n(TD) -n+ detectors irradiated by 24 GeV/c protons were analyzed using the data on the current <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> and the Double Peak (DP) electric field distribution model for heavily irradiated detectors. The approach considers an irradiated detector as a structure with three regions in which the electric field depends on the coordinate, and the induced current <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> arises from the drift process of free carriers in the detector with variable electric field. Reconstruction of the E(x) profile from the <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> shapes is performed employing a new method for DP electric field reconstruction.
