The music on Electronic Sound, consisting of two extended instrumental pieces - [...] "Under the Mersey Wall" [...] and [...] "No Time or Space" [...] - was performed on a Moog IIIc modular system. Harrison bought the system directly from Robert Moog and later had it set up at EMI Studios in London for the Beatles to use on their recordings. In author Alan Clayson's view, the album was Harrison's [...] "gesture of artistic solidarity" [...] towards John Lennon and Yoko Ono, whose experimental collaborations, having first appeared on the Beatles' 1968 track [...] "Revolution 9", made up Zapple's other inaugural album, Life with the Lions. In a 1987 interview, Harrison said that Electronic Sound, like the Lennon-Ono album, was an example of Zapple's ethos of [...] "letting serendipity take hold" [...] rather than a formal creative work.|$|E

40|$|A compact 7 x 7 flat {{lens antenna}} design for Xband {{applications}} {{is presented in}} this paper. A new design with aperture-coupled E-shaped patch elements at 10 GHz is simulated and analyzed. This antenna design is realized by using two back-to-back printed patches with slotted common ground plane and feed horn antenna. The transmission loss obtained of 2. 2 dB is sufficiently low. A 320 º transmission phase range for the E-shaped <b>patch</b> <b>unit</b> cell is achieved with less than 1. 5 dB of deviation in the transmission loss level.

40|$|Infinite reflectarrays in the X-band {{frequency}} range has been designed, and various slot configurations {{have been proposed}} to optimize the design of reconfigurable reflectarray antennas in the X-band {{frequency range}}. It has been demonstrated that the introduction of slots in the patch element causes {{a decrease in the}} maximum surface current density (J) and electric field intensity (E) and hence causes a variation in the resonance frequency of the reflectarray. Waveguide simulator technique has been used to represent infinite reflectarrays with a two <b>patch</b> <b>unit</b> cell element. Scattering parameter measurements of infinite reflectarrays have been carried out using vector network analyzer and a change in resonant frequency from 10 GHz to 8. 3 GHz has been shown for a slot width of 0. 5 W (W is the width of patch element) as compared to patch element without slot. Furthermore a maximum attainable dynamic phase range of 314 °has been achieved by using slots in the patch element constructed on 0. 508 mm thick substrate with a maximum surface current density (J) of 113 A/m and Electrical field intensity (E) of 14 kV/m for 0. 5 W slot in the patch element...|$|E
40|$|A {{stretchable}} electromagnetic absorber fabricated using {{screen printing}} technology is proposed in this paper. We used a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate to fabricate the stretchable absorber since PDMS exhibits good dielectric properties, flexibility, and restoring capabilities. DuPont PE 872 (DuPont, Wilmington, CT, USA), a stretchable silver conductive ink, {{was used for}} the screen printing technique. The reflection coefficient of the absorber was measured using a vector network analyzer and a waveguide. The proposed absorber was designed as a rectangular <b>patch</b> <b>unit</b> cell, wherein the top of the unit cell acted as the patch and the bottom formed the ground. The size of the patch was 8 mm × 7 mm. The prototype of the absorber consisted of two unit cells such that it fits into the WR- 90 waveguide (dimensions: 22. 86 mm × 10. 16 mm) for experimental measurement. Before stretching the absorber, the resonant frequency was 11 GHz. When stretched along the x-direction, the resonant frequency shifted by 0. 1 GHz, from 11 to 10. 9 GHz, demonstrating 99 % absorption. Furthermore, when stretched along the y-direction, the resonant frequency shifted by 0. 6 GHz, from 11 to 10. 4 GHz, demonstrating 99 % absorption...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{performance}} of different unit cell shapes in the reflectarray antenna design {{and to provide a}} reference guide for researchers which reduce the time spent in the study of unit cell performance. Methods/Statistical Analysis: This paper employs related literature review and design. The design aspect being with the study of different unit cell elements, the optimized unit cell sizes are then used to build a reflectarray antenna. The antenna analysis was carried out via simulations on CST studio 2015. Findings: It is observed from exiting literature that although several unit cell have been studied in the design of reflectarry, no comparison has been made from the different unit cells performance. The simulated results show that reflectarray antenna can achieve high gain and high performance with the benefit of low cost, low weight, low transmission losses due to the low profile of the feeding mechanism and their small size. In addition, the study shows that circular <b>patch</b> <b>unit</b> cell elements perform better than the rectangular, triangular and cross shape studied in this paper. Applications/Improvements: This paper shows {{the performance of}} four different unit cell shapes at 12 HGz, the optimized unit cell are then used to achieve high gain reflector ray antenna...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{communication}} systems require intelligent antenna arrays to achieve increased phase range {{for the performance}} improvement. Moreover the design requirements of spacecraft antennas for satellite communications and telecommunication missions require multifunction antennas to prevent the propagation of electromagnetic waves in certain frequency bands. This project investigates the feasibility of employing reflectarray antenna integrated with FSS textured configurations to combat the scan blindness problem. Performance investigation of different strategic resonant elements {{has been carried out}} in X-band frequency range by using commercially available computer models of CST MWS and Ansoft HFSS based on Finite Integral Method (FIM) and Finite Element Method (FEM) respectively. Frequency Selective characteristics are also exploited by embedding the dipole, square loop and triangular loop resonant elements on top of the groundless substrate. Integrated FSS Reflectarray (FSS-RA) configurations based on iterative loop length approach are than implemented for operation in both X and Ku-band to improve the static phase range for the reduction of phase errors resulting in scan blindness. It has been demonstrated that the maximum static phase range of 540 ° can be obtained with the loop length variation of 6. 8 mm. Moreover novel algorithms based on mathematical models have been developed for the calculation of progressive phase distribution depicted by each individual resonant element and resonant frequency estimation of FSS reflectarrays. In order to validate the authenticity of numerical results waveguide scattering parameter measurements have been carried out by fabricating two <b>patch</b> <b>unit</b> cells for each reflectarray resonant element. Measured results demonstrated that reduction in reflection area of resonant elements from 105. 74 mm 2 to 7. 33 mm 2 tends to increase the reflection loss values from 2. 63 dB to 20. 25 dB. Moreover, an increased measured static phase range of 290 ° offering the reduction in phase errors is also shown by employing the triangular loop element...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} addressed {{problems in}} scaling, {{problems that are}} among the main challenges in remote sensing. The principal objective of the research {{was to investigate the}} effects of changing spatial scale on the representation of land cover. A second objective was to determine the relationship between such effects, characteristics of landscape structure and scaling procedures. Four research issues related to spatial scaling were examined. They included: (1) the upscaling of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); (2) the effects of spatial scale on indices of landscape structure; (3) the representation of land cover databases at different spatial scales; and (4) the relationships between landscape indices and land cover area estimations. ^ The overall bias resulting from non-linearity of NDVI in relation to spatial resolution is generally insignificant as compared to other factors such as influences of aerosols and water vapor. The bias is, however, related to land surface characteristics. Significant errors may be introduced in heterogeneous areas where different land cover types exhibit strong spectral contrast. Spatially upscaled SPOT and TM NDVIs have information content comparable with the AVHRR-derived NDVI. Indices of landscape structure and spatial resolution are generally related, but the exact forms of the relationships are subject to changes in other factors including the basic <b>patch</b> <b>unit</b> constituting a landscape and the proportional area of foreground land cover under consideration. The extent of agreement between spatially aggregated coarse resolution land cover datasets and full resolution datasets changes with the properties of the original datasets, including the pixel size and class definition. There are close relationships between landscape structure and class areas estimated from spatially aggregated land cover databases. The relationships, however, do not permit extension from one area to another. Inversion calibration across different geographic/ecological areas is, therefore, not feasible. Different rules govern the land cover area changes across resolutions when different upscaling methods are used. Special attention should be given to comparison between land cover maps derived using different methods. ...|$|E
