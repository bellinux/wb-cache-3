5000|$|If {{the metal}} {{has not yet}} started to crack, {{embrittlement}} can be reversed by removing the hydrogen source and causing the hydrogen within the metal to diffuse out through heat treatment. This de-embrittlement process, known as [...] "baking", is used to overcome the weaknesses of methods such as electroplating which introduce hydrogen to the metal, but is not always entirely effective. In the case of welding, often pre- and <b>post-heating</b> the metal is applied to allow the hydrogen to diffuse out before it can cause any damage. This is specifically done with high-strength steels and low alloy steels such as the chrome/molybdenum/vanadium alloys. Due to {{the time needed to}} re-combine hydrogen atoms into the hydrogen molecules, hydrogen cracking due to welding can occur over 24 hours after the welding operation is completed.|$|E

Experimental results showed that <b>post-heating</b> temperature affected the microstructure, electrical resistance, and optical transmittance of the AZO films. From the X-ray diffraction analysis, all films have hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure. Optical transmittance spectra of the AZO films exhibited transmittance higher than about 80 % within the visible wavelength region and the optical direct band gap (Eg) of these films was increased with increasing <b>post-heating</b> temperature.

40|$|In {{the light}} of extreme events of natural {{disasters}} (earthquakes or hurricanes) and accidents (fire or explosion), repairing and strengthening of existing concrete structures has become more common {{during the last decade}} due to the increasing knowledge and confidence in the use of composite advanced repairing materials. The past experience from real fires shows that it is exceptional for a concrete building to collapse as a result of fire and most fire-damaged concrete structures can be repaired economically rather than completely replacing or demolishing them. In this connection an experimental study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of fibre reinforced polymer jackets for axial compressive and seismic shear performance of <b>post-heated</b> columns. This study also investigates the effectiveness of ferrocement laminate for the repairing of <b>post-heated</b> reinforced concrete columns. A total of thirty-five reinforced concrete columns were constructed and then tested after categorising them into three main groups: un-heated, <b>post-heated</b> and <b>post-heated</b> repaired. The <b>post-heated</b> columns were initially damaged by heating (to a uniform temperature of 500 °C). The concrete cubes were also heated to various temperatures to develop the relation between compressive strength and ultrasonic pulse velocity. The residual compressive strength of the concrete cubes and reinforced concrete columns were determined by ultrasonic testing. The <b>post-heated</b> columns were subsequently repaired with unidirectional glass or carbon fibre reinforced polymer and ferrocement jackets. The experimental programme was divided into two parts. The columns of experimental part- 1 were tested under axial compressive loading. The columns of experimental part- 2 with a shear span to depth ratio of 2. 5 were tested under constant axial and reversed lateral cyclic loading. The results indicated that the trend of reduction in ultrasonic pulse velocity values and in residual compressive strength of concrete was similar with increasing temperature. The reduction in residual stiffness of both <b>post-heated</b> square and circular columns was greater than the reduction in ultimate load. The circular sections benefited more compared to the square cross-sections with fibre reinforced polymers for improving the performance of <b>post-heated</b> columns in terms of compressive strength and ductility tested under axial compression. GFRP and CFRP jackets performed in an excellent way for increasing the shear capacity, lateral strength, ductility, energy dissipation and slowed the rate of strength and stiffness degradation of fire damaged reinforced concrete square and circular columns tested under combined constant axial and reversed lateral cycle loading. However, the effect of a single layer of glass or carbon fibre reinforced polymer on the axial stiffness of <b>post-heated</b> square and circular columns was negligible. The use of a ferrocement jacket for the repairing of <b>post-heated</b> square and circular columns enhanced the axial stiffness and ultimate load carrying capacity of columns significantly.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the effect of {{different}} combinations of induction heating and autogenous CO 2 laser welding on the gradients of microstructure, microhardness and residual stresses in butt-joints of thermomechanically processed S 500 MC steel grade.

The induction-assisted CO 2 laser welding strategies were compared to individual CO 2 and Nd:YAG fiber welding procedures. The results demonstrate that induction heating can be combined to laser welding in order to effectively increase the cooling times. Martensite formation could be suppressed within the fusion and heat-affected zones and smooth hardness distributions were obtained by pre-heating and combined pre- and <b>post-heating.</b> The tensile residual stresses are, however, still of significance because of the high transformation temperatures (&# 62; 500 °C) observed for the S 500 MC steel.

40|$|Thermal {{treatments}} for tissue ablation rely upon the heating of cells past a threshold beyond which the cells are considered destroyed, denatured, or killed. In this article, a novel three-state model for cell death is proposed where {{there exists a}} vulnerable state positioned between the alive and dead states used {{in a number of}} existing cell death models. Proposed rate coefficients include temperature dependence and the model is fitted to experimental data of heated co-cultures of hepatocytes and lung fibroblasts with very small RMS error.

For the two cell lines employed in the experimental data, the three parameters for fast cell death appear to be linearly increasing with % content of lung fibroblast, while the sparse nature of the data did not indicate any co-culture make-up dependence for the parameters for slow cell death. A critical <b>post-heating</b> cell viability threshold is proposed beyond which cells progress to death; and these results are of practical importance with potential for more accurate prediction of cell death...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} few years various {{experimental}} destructive and non-destructive methods were developed to evaluate residual stresses. However it is impossible to obtain a full residual stress distribution in welded structures by means of experimental methods. This disadvantage can be solved by means of computational analysis which allows to determine the whole stress and strain fields in complex structures. In this paper the temperature distribution and residual stresses were determined in a single-pass butt joint welded by GMAW (Gas Metal Arc Welding) process by finite element model (FEM). A 3 D finite parametric element model has been carried out to analyze temperature distribution in butt weld joints and thermo-mechanical analyses were performed to evaluate resulting residual stresses. Temperature fields have been investigated by varying an initial preheating treatment. Moreover the technique of "element birth and death" was adopted to simulate the process of filler metal addition The high stresses were evaluated, with particular regard to fusion zone and heat affected zone. The influence of preheating and <b>post-heating</b> treatment on residual stresses was investigated. The residual stresses decrease when preheating temperature increases. The maximum value of longitudinal residual stresses without pre-heating can be reduced about 12 % and 38 % by using the preheating and <b>post-heating</b> process respectively...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of <b>post-heat</b> treatment on the physical and mechanical properties of MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard) panels.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to deposit dense intermetallic compound coatings by cold spraying directly using the compound feedstock powders due to their intrinsic low-temperature brittleness. A method to prepare intermetallic compound coatings in-situ employing cold spraying was developed using a metastable alloy powder assisted with <b>post-heat</b> treatment. In this study, a nanostructured Fe/Al alloy powder was pre-pared by ball-milling process. The cold-sprayed Fe/Al alloy coating was evolved in-situ to intermetallic compound coating through a <b>post-heat</b> treatment.

Expression of {{a dominant}} negative HSF 1 mutant (dnHSF 1), which among other effects depletes cells of HSF 1 -regulated chaperones, blocked <b>post-heat</b> shock refolding of luciferase targeted to the cytoplasm, nucleus, or peroxisomes, while refolding of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -targeted luciferase was inhibited by about 50 %. Luciferase refolding in the cytoplasm could be partially restored by expression of HSPA 1 A and fully by both HSPA 1 A and DNAJB 1. For full refolding of ER luciferase, HSPA 1 A expression sufficed. Neither nuclear nor peroxisomal refolding was rescued by HSPA 1 A. A stimulatory effect of DNAJB 1 on <b>post-heat</b> shock peroxisomal luciferase refolding {{was seen in}} control cells, while refolding in the cytoplasm or nucleus in control cells was inhibited by DNAJB 1 expression {{in the absence of}} added HSPA 1 A. HSPB 1 also improved refolding of peroxisomal luciferase in control cells, but not in dnHSF 1 expressing cells. HSP 90, HSPA 5, HSPA 6, and phosphomevalonate kinase (of which the synthesis is also downregulated by dnHSF 1) had no effect on peroxisomal refolding in either control or chaperone-depleted cells.

The fire performance of glass/epoxy laminates surface-coated with varied formulations was evaluated using a cone calorimeter under various external heat fluxes (25, 50 and 65 kW/m 2). Self-sustained ignition was significantly delayed for fire-protected laminates relative to the control. The peak heat release rates and the time to reach this event were significantly reduced in thermally-protected laminates. In addition to the chemical nature of flame retardant chemicals present in the coatings, the time to reach the peak heat release rate and {{the magnitude of the}} total heat release were influenced by the quantity and morphology of the char formed by each type of surface coating.

The <b>post-heat</b> treatment of the as-deposited coating was carried out in Ar at 400 ° and 800 °C, respectively. The coatings were characterized by means of an electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA) with wavelength dispersive X-ray spectrometers (WDS).

Therefore, the corrosion experiments were conducted for the substrate, the as-deposited coating and the <b>post-heat</b> treated coating at 800 °C.

The corrosion current density (Icorr) of this coating was approximately 3 and 4 times smaller than that corresponding to the as-deposited coating and steel substrate, respectively. This significant improvement of the corrosion behavior of the <b>post-heat</b> treated coating is mainly due to both the microstructural changes that take place in the coating and the diffusion of Ni into Fe at the coating-substrate interface, which ensures the presence of a metallurgical bond...|$|R

30|$|Changes in anhysteretic {{remanent}} magnetization (ARM) may mimic {{changes in}} TRM {{and have been}} used to monitor alteration. In the Shaw (1974) method, AF demagnetized ARMs acquired before and after the application of the total TRM step are used to assess alteration. Furthermore, expanding upon the idea of Kono (1978), Rolph and Shaw (1985) used the ratio of the pre- and <b>post-heating</b> ARMs to correct for non-linear alteration of the TRM at the same AF steps. The Rolph and Shaw (1985) correction to Shaw (1974) data is noted in the database. However, the degree to which ARM can correct for alteration of TRM is unclear (Tanaka and Komuro 2000; Valet and Herrero-Bervera 2009). To test the applicability of the ARM correction, Tsunakawa and Shaw (1994) incorporated a second TRM step: the double heating test (DHT). This compares the first TRM with the second TRM corrected using the ratio of ARMs before and after the second heating. If {{the difference between the two}} TRMs is greater than the experimental error, it is assumed that the ARM correction does not fully correct or over corrects the paleointensity estimate. As with methods to correct for alteration during Thellier-type methods, this correction should be treated with caution, especially for cases when the ratio of the pre- and <b>post-heating</b> ARMs is far from unity; however, this correction is a standard step in more recent applications of the Shaw (1974) method (e.g., Yamamoto et al.

30|$|This article {{presents}} an experimental study into thermal softening and thermal {{recovery of the}} compression strength properties of structural balsa wood (Ochroma pyramidale). Balsa is a core material used in sandwich composite structures for applications where fire is an ever-present risk, such as ships and buildings. This article investigates the thermal softening response of balsa with increasing temperature, and the thermal recovery behavior when softened balsa is cooled following heating. Exposure to elevated temperatures was limited to a short time (15 min), representative of a fire or postfire scenario. The compression strength of balsa decreased progressively with increasing temperature from 20 ° to 250 °C. The degradation rates in the strength properties over this temperature range were similar in the axial and radial directions of the balsa grains. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed only small mass losses (< 2 %) in this temperature range. Environmental scanning electron microscopy showed minor physical changes to the wood grain structure from 190 ° to 250 °C, with holes beginning to form in the cell wall at 250 °C. The reduction in compression properties is attributed mostly to thermal viscous softening of the hemicellulose and lignin in the cell walls. <b>Post-heating</b> tests revealed that thermal softening up to 250 °C is fully reversible when balsa is cooled to room temperature. When balsa is heated to 250 °C or higher, the <b>post-heating</b> strength properties are reduced significantly by decomposition processes of all wood constituents, which irreversibly degrade the wood microstructure. This study revealed that the balsa core in sandwich composite structures must remain below 200 °– 250 °C when exposed to fire to avoid permanent heat damage.|$|E

Achillopoulou and Karabinis (Achillopoulou and Karabnis 2015) use a high strength fibre-reinforced thixotropic material to repair the casting imperfection of RC square columns. After repairing with this material, the RC columns have a lower load-carrying capacity compared to the non-damaged RC column. The reduction is up to 22 % and {{it depends on the}} extent of damages. Yaqub and Bailey (Yaqub and Bailey 2011) use an epoxy resin to repair <b>post-heated</b> RC circular column. The result indicates that a patching to the spalling of <b>post-heated</b> RC column with epoxy resin could increase the capacity by 15 % compared to the non-spalling <b>post-heated</b> RC column. However, the patching itself could not restore the original capacity of the unheated RC column unless it is combined with the FRP composite wrapping. Meanwhile, various types of polymer-modified cementitious mortars have been used by Porto et al. (2012) to repair RC square columns. The structural performance of the repaired RC columns is lower compared the non-damaged RC column. They identified that the elastic modulus and compressive strength of repair material are key properties for assessing the suitability of repair material to restore the RC columns. With elastic modulus and compressive strength most similar to the concrete substrate, it is expected the repair material will restore the structural performance of the damaged RC columns.|$|R

As main outcome, the elevated temperature effected significantly the insulation layer and provided considerable reduction of the initial global stiffness and of the load carrying capacity...|$|E
40|$|A {{commercial}} foundry {{has been}} established which makes extensive use of fluid beds {{in the production of}} heat treated alloy steel castings. The castings are cooled immediately after solidification by fluidizing the mold sand in which they were cast. Castings are then normalized and tempered in separate fluid bath furnaces with the entire operation being completed within a few hours of pouring. Fluid baths are also used for cooling of spent sand and for quenching of castings. Trial applications with austempering cycles have been conducted with excellent results. A unique fluid bed bath which is used for preheating, weld positioning and <b>post-heating</b> of castings has also been produced. Substantial energy and material handling savings have been obtained. Areas requiring further design and development of fluid bed applications are also described...|$|E
30|$|Herein, in this study, we {{synthesized}} (Co, Mn) 3 O 4 nanogranules composite using {{a method}} of co-precipitation under O 3 oxidizing conditions followed by <b>post-heat</b> treatment. This precipitation process has very high production efficient within 1  h. The crystal structure and morphology are investigated. And the electrochemical tests show that the (Co, Mn) 3 O 4 electrode demonstrated a large specific capacitance and a long cycle life.|$|R
40|$|Nickel oxide (NiO) {{thin films}} were {{deposited}} by e-beam evaporation on glass and ITO coated glass substrates initially held {{at room temperature}} without <b>post-heat</b> treatments. The structural and optical properties were investigated using glancing incident X-ray diffractometer (GIXRD) and spectrophotometer. The electrochromic (EC) behavior of NiO thin film was investigated using electrochemical technique viz. cyclic voltammetry, constant current measurement, and chronoamperometry in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The transmittance modulation and switching time with different operating voltage were also studied...|$|R
40|$|In general, {{concrete}} structures {{have high}} fire-resistance. When exposed to fire, however, {{the strength and}} stiffness of the concrete and reinforcing steel deteriorate significantly. Fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) wraps are an excellent material for strengthening concrete to increase its axial load capacity. This paper describes an experimental study on fourteen concrete cylinders after exposure to 500 oC for one hour and cooling to room temperature which were then wrapped and tested under axial compression to failure to determine the ultimate axial strength. The {{purpose of the study}} was to extend the Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) confinement technique to investigate the residual concrete strength of <b>post-heated</b> RC cylinders strengthened/confined with CFRP fabrics. The experimental parameters included type of reinforcement and number of CFRP fabric layers. It was found that repairing heat-damaged cylinders with 1, 2 and 3 layers of unidirectional CFRP can be highly effective for enhancing the compressive strength of concrete damaged by high temperature. The residual concrete strength of <b>post-heated</b> cylinders can be restored to the original level or higher than that of unwrapped cylinders. The failure mode of the confined concrete was predominantly rupture of the CFRP sheets...|$|R
