5|$|Haynes asked Fitch {{to observe}} the ailerons through the <b>passenger</b> <b>cabin</b> windows to see if control inputs were having any effect. Fitch {{reported}} back that the ailerons were not moving at all. Nonetheless, the crew continued to manipulate their control columns {{for the remainder of}} the flight, hoping for at least some effect. Haynes then asked Fitch to take over control of the throttles so that Haynes could concentrate on his control column. With one throttle in each hand, Fitch was able to mitigate the phugoid cycle and make rough steering adjustments.|$|E
5|$|The de Havilland DH 106 Comet was the world's first {{commercial}} jetliner. Developed and manufactured by de Havilland at its Hatfield Aerodrome, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom headquarters, the Comet1 prototype first flew on 27 July 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four de Havilland Ghost turbojet engines {{buried in the}} wings, a pressurised fuselage, and large square windows. For the era, it offered a relatively quiet, comfortable <b>passenger</b> <b>cabin</b> and showed signs of being a commercial success at its 1952 debut.|$|E
50|$|The Tu-116 was a Tu-95 bomber {{fitted with}} {{pressurized}} <b>passenger</b> <b>cabins</b> built {{to serve as}} the official government transport. The two <b>passenger</b> <b>cabins</b> were fitted in the space of bomb bays and were not connected to each other or the flight deck.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>passenger</b> <b>cabins</b> (or capsules) {{are mounted}} on the wheel's {{outboard}} rim and are individually rotated by electric motors to smoothly maintain a horizontal cabin floor throughout each full rotation.

5|$|In May 1985, {{designers}} {{started work}} on the F1 project. In late 1985, designers presented the first exterior study models to F1 management, featuring a sports car-like design with a low-slung hood and narrow front profile. By 1986, the sedan used a three-box design with an upright stance, more prominent grille, and a two-tone body. Extensive modeling and wind tunnel tests resulted in a low drag coefficient for a conventional production vehicle of the time (C'd 0.29). For the <b>passenger</b> <b>cabin,</b> the materials-selection tests evaluated 24 different kinds of wood and multiple types of leather {{for two years before}} settling on specific trim combinations. By 1986, the Lexus marque was created to support the launch of the flagship sedan, and the vehicle became known as the Lexus LS. Following eight design reviews, subsequent revisions, concept approval in September 1986, and over US$1 billion in development expenses, the final design for the production Lexus LS 400 (chassis code UCF10) was frozen in May 1987 with design patents filed on 13 May 1987.|$|E

25|$|Maximum comfort was {{required}} for passengers and crew: the Kent's <b>passenger</b> <b>cabin</b> was 8ft 6 in (2.59 m) wide and 14ft (4.27 m) long. The seating was arranged in four rows of facing pairs, with a centre aisle, Pullman-style. The steward's pantry, situated {{on the port side}} aft of the <b>passenger</b> <b>cabin,</b> was equipped with twin-burner oil stoves on which stewards (and the valets of valued passengers) could cook meals in flight. The toilet and washroom were opposite the pantry; the mail and freight compartment was further aft.|$|E

The <b>passenger</b> <b>cabins</b> were set by day with a sofa which converted to two beds, one above the other, at night. The crew's quarters were located inside the hull and were reached by a catwalk. The galley was equipped with a single electric oven with two compartments and hot plates on top for cooking. One luxury that was not provided on the Graf Zeppelin was heating.|$|R

25|$|Investigators {{devised a}} new test {{involving}} a cargo hold with {{conditions similar to}} the conditions of Flight 295; the plastic covers and extra pallets provided fuel for the fire, which would spread quickly before generating enough smoke to activate smoke alarms. The hotter flame achieved in the new test heated {{the air in the}} cargo hold. This heated air had a higher pressure than normal, and overcame the pressure differential between the cargo hold and the <b>passenger</b> <b>cabin.</b> When the door between the passenger and cargo holds was open, smoke and gases therefore flowed into the <b>passenger</b> <b>cabin.</b>|$|E
