5|$|McGinnity {{began the}} 1902 {{season with the}} Orioles. However, the {{franchise}} began to fall into significant debt. Joe Kelley, star player for the Orioles and son-in-law of part-owner John Mahon, reported that the team owed as much as $12,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Unable to afford that debt, Mahon purchased shares of the team from Kelley and player-manager John McGraw, who had resigned from the team and signed with the New York Giants of the NL.

5|$|New York City {{attorney}} William Shea {{was attempting}} to create the Continental League, a rival league to Major League Baseball. Hunt met with him, and Shea suggested Harry Wismer, a minority shareholder in both the Washington Redskins and Detroit Lions, as a potential New York franchise owner for the new football league. Wismer was willing; he was feuding at the time with the Redskins' <b>principal</b> <b>owner,</b> George Preston Marshall, and realized he would never own the Washington franchise.

5|$|Kelley {{was named}} Orioles' captain and {{received}} some {{stock in the}} team. McGraw, player-manager of the Orioles, resigned from the team to take over as manager of the New York Giants on July 7, 1902. In his absence, Kelley and Wilbert Robinson took over in the interim. Under indefinite suspension by Ban Johnson by July 1902 for fighting with umpires, Kelley entertained the idea of leaving the Orioles with McGraw, who was becoming frustrated with Johnson, and had begun negotiating to join the New York Giants of the NL. With the team in financial straits, Kelley sold his shares of the Orioles to Mahon, who had purchased McGraw's shares when he left for New York, becoming principal shareholder of the Orioles. Mahon then sold controlling interest in the Orioles to Andrew Freedman, <b>principal</b> <b>owner</b> of the Giants, and John T. Brush, <b>principal</b> <b>owner</b> of the Cincinnati Reds, on July 17. On the day they owned the franchise, they released the best players on the Orioles from their contracts {{so that they could}} be signed by National League teams: Kelley and Cy Seymour signed with the Reds, while McGinnity, Roger Bresnahan, Dan McGann, and Jack Cronin signed with the Giants. Johnson, along with Orioles minority owners, took control of the Orioles franchise, which had to forfeit their game that day as they did not have enough players. Kelley stated that the Orioles owed $12,000 ($ in current dollar terms), and that selling his shares was the only way Mahon could pay the team's debts.|$|E
5|$|Rodriguez again won the AL MVP {{award in}} 2007, as his 54 {{home runs and}} 156 RBIs topped the AL; he scored 143 runs, the highest single-season number by a player since 1985. After {{starting}} the year 21–29, the Yankees rallied to win the AL's wild card berth; {{it was the first}} time in 10 seasons that they did not win the AL East. New York's season ended in the first round of the playoffs; the Indians won the opening two games of the ALDS and finished the series in four games. Manager Torre did not re-sign after the season, and Joe Girardi took his place. Rodriguez, who used an opt-out clause in his contract to become a free agent, stayed with the Yankees by signing for $275million over 10 seasons, an MLB record. The 2008 season was the Yankees' last in which they played at the original Yankee Stadium. The club had sought a new stadium to increase revenues, following the example set by other MLB teams. It was also the first in which Hal and Hank Steinbrenner ran the team as general partners; though George Steinbrenner was still the <b>principal</b> <b>owner</b> on paper, he yielded operational responsibilities during the 2007 offseason. Yankee Stadium was the site of the 2008 All-Star Game, but for the first time in 14 years did not host playoff action.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the board-member independence, family control, and financial performance in Swedish listed firms. The degree of independence is defined with respect to the <b>principal</b> <b>owners,</b> the management of the firm, and the employees. The definition of independence, as applied by the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance, together with good accessibility of detailed data on corporate governance variables, makes it possible to apply a precise measure of board-member independency.
