Prestress strands {{are the key}} {{parts of}} the <b>{{prestressed}}</b> <b>structure,</b> and {{the stress of the}} prestressed strands is one of the important indicators to assess prestress component security. Unfortunately, up to date, there are no qualified techniques to handle this issue due to that it is too hard for sensors to survive the harsh construction environments and the time-dependent service life of prestressed structures. In this paper, a novel smart steel strand based on the technique of GFRP-FBG rebar was introduced, and its sensing principle has also been given in details. The novel smart steel strand has been tested by serious experiments to research its mechanical and sensing properties. The monitoring results show that the mechanical properties of the smart strands are similar to ordinary strands, and its sensing properties include that distinguish-ability is less than 0. 466 % F•S, hysteresis less than 2. 15 % F•S, repeatability less than 1. 32 % F•S, linearity less than 0. 86 % F•S, and overall accuracy less than 2. 67 % F•S.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} the mathematical model and numerical procedure for geometrically and materially non-linear static analysis and fire resistance of <b>prestressed</b> concrete <b>structures.</b> The mathematical model {{is limited to}} pretensioned <b>prestressed</b> concrete <b>structure.</b> In the derivation of matematical model the slip effect between concrete part of the structure and prestressing steel is considered, while the concrete spalling is not included into the matematical model. Because the problem was very complex we decided to divide the thesis into two parts. The first part {{presents the}} static analysis and the system of fundamental equations of <b>prestressed</b> concrete <b>structures</b> considering slip effect between concrete part of structure and prestressing steel. Reissner’s planar beam theory is used to model the concrete part of the structure, while the prestressing steel is modelled as a rope model. The system of the fundamental equations has to be solved numerically. Therefore, a modified principle of virtual work is used to derive the strain based family of finite elements for a non-linear analysis of <b>prestressed</b> concrete <b>structures.</b> The applicability and {{the accuracy of the}} proposed mathematical model and numerical procedure of <b>prestressed</b> concrete <b>structures</b> subjected to static load are illustrated and verified by numerical examples avaliable in literature. It was found out that the slip effect between concrete part of the structure and prestressing steel has a significant influence on kinematic and static quantities in <b>prestressed</b> concrete <b>structures.</b> In the second part, which is {{the main part of the}} thesis the mathematical model and numerical procedure is expanded to the analysis of <b>prestressed</b> concrete <b>structure</b> exposed to fire. Because the problem is very complex, the problem was devided into two phases. In the first phase the temperature and moisture content in concrete section are analysed. The Luikov matematical model with two coupled non-linear partial differential equations is used to describe the simultaneous heat and moisture content. Material parameters are dependent on temperature and moisture content. Generally, the exact solution of this problem is not known, therefore the simultaneous heat and moisture content in porous material has to be solved numerically. In our case the finite difference method is used. The temperature field of the structure represents the temperature load in the second phase of the analysis, where the mechanical response of <b>prestressed</b> concrete <b>structures</b> simultaneously exposed to static load and fire is presented. Concrete, reinforcing and prestressing steel all depend on temperature. Also, the slip-shear stress relationship between concrete part of the structure and prestressing steel depend on temperature. The geometric strain increment is assumed to be the sum of increments of elastic, plastic, temperature and creep strain in concrete, reinforcing steel and prestressing steel and the increment of trainsent strain in concrete. The applicability and the accuracy of <b>prestressed</b> concrete <b>structures</b> subjected to static load and fire is illustrated and verified by numerical examples avaliable in literature. It was found out that simultaneous heat and moisture content has an important influence on the temperature and moisture content analysis in concrete.
