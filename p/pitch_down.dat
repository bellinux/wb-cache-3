5|$|When any {{aircraft}} {{passes the}} critical mach {{of that particular}} airframe, the centre of pressure shifts rearwards. This causes a <b>pitch</b> <b>down</b> moment on the aircraft if the centre of gravity remains where it was. The engineers designed the wings in a specific manner to reduce this shift, {{but there was still}} a shift of about 2metres. This could have been countered by the use of trim controls, but at such high speeds this would have dramatically increased drag. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of gravity, effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control.|$|E

500|$|In 1958 he {{was second}} {{in the league in}} both wins (17) and ERA (2.68); his seventh two-hitter, a 1–0 win on June 21 against the Baltimore Orioles in which the White Sox scored only an unearned run in the first inning, was {{followed}} by the greatest game of his career. On June 27 against the Senators, he retired the first 26 batters before pinch hitter Ed Fitz Gerald lined Pierce's first <b>pitch</b> <b>down</b> the first base line for an opposite-field double that landed about a foot from the foul line. Pierce then struck out Albie Pearson on three pitches to end the game; only twice did he go to a three-ball count. The lone hit marred what would have been a remarkable accomplishment; not only had no left-hander pitched a perfect game since Lee Richmond in 1880, but only one AL left-hander (Mel Parnell in 1956) pitched even a no-hitter between 1931 and 1962. Although disappointed by the near miss, Pierce praised his teammates for their defensive work, saying, [...] "Give Luis plenty of credit. And Sherm really mixed 'em up beautifully. The big thing is that we won." [...] At a Capitol lunch with several White Sox players during the following year's pennant race, Vice President Richard Nixon told Pierce that he had watched the game on television, saying, [...] "I'm a Washington fan, but that was one night I was rooting for the White Sox." [...] In a 1982 interview, Pierce said, [...] "The book on Fitz Gerald was that he was a fastball hitter on the first ball and liked it inside where he could pull it. So we threw him a curve away and he hit into right for a solid hit. I didn't feel that badly about it, really. It didn't mean that much at the moment. But now ... well, now I wish I had got it. It would have been nice." [...] His streak of 33 consecutive scoreless innings was ended with an unearned run in the seventh inning on July 1.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 October 2008, an Airbus A330-300 {{registered}} VH-QPA, travelling from Singapore Changi Airport to Perth, Western Australia as Qantas Flight 72, {{suffered a}} rapid loss of altitude in two sudden uncommanded <b>pitch</b> <b>down</b> manoeuvres causing serious injuries while [...] from Learmonth.

2500|$|At 1:38am the {{aircraft}} began its take-off roll one degree {{to the right}} of the runway center line.

The forward fuselage and main wing section were completely destroyed. The force of the impact tore away the tail section and it came to rest inverted separated from the burning forward section. Many of the survivors were seated in this part of the aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|By mid-1941 an Il-2 exemplar was {{experimentally}} {{fitted with}} a pair of Sh-37 cannons in underwing pods. By September 15, this aircraft had passed ground and air firing test at the factory, and was presented for state trials, which were conducted between September 23 and October 12, 1941. Each Sh-37 gun on this Il-2 was provisioned with 40 rounds of ammunition. The large ammunition magazine did not fit in the wings, and mandated a conformal gun pod mount of a rather bulky design. As fitted to the wing of the Il-2, the weight of the Sh-37 with the assembly and magazine was 302.5kg. The rate of fire measured in this latter installation was 169rpm; muzzle velocity was 894m/s. The underwing position of the 37mm gun pods in the Il-2 had the unpleasant effect that when the guns were fired in a dive, their recoil caused the aircraft to <b>pitch</b> <b>down</b> even further, thus reducing salvo accuracy. The flight characteristics of the Il-2 armed with the Sh-37 guns were substantially worse than for the regular versions fitted with 20 or 23mm guns. It was slower and more difficult to handle.

2500|$|The Gulfstream II is a twin-jet {{swept wing}} {{corporate}} transport powered by two Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines {{and designed to}} provide high speed and long range capability without sacrificing the airport performance, reliability, and other operational advantages of its predecessor, the turboprop Gulfstream I. Preliminary design of the wing was influenced by both cruise and low speed considerations. The aft-mounted engine location was selected after extensive analysis and design iterations considering aerodynamic, structural, and ground clearance requirements. Airfoil geometry was developed to maximum sweep benefit from the selected planform. [...] The interference problem at the wing-body juncture was treated by modification of the airfoil shape and thickness over the inner third of the wing span. The basic airfoils for the main area of the wing {{are similar to those}} of the Grumman A-6 Intruder aircraft and utilize NACA 6-series thickness distributions combined with an in-house mean line. A buffet boundary commensurate with the M=.85 speed capability was attained by incorporating a row of co-rotating vortex generators on the outer wing panel. In developing the wing contours, attention was paid to the aircraft's low speed requirements by tailoring the leading edge radius to preclude leading edge separation. The high lift configuration, consists of a one piece, single-slotted Fowler flap of 30% chord. [...] Stall initiation on the basic wing was found to occur at midspan but spread rapidly to the tip, particularly at large flap deflections. The addition of an upper surface fence at about midspan provided a strong <b>pitch</b> <b>down</b> at the stall, without sacrificing maximum lift, and also afforded an adequate margin between initial and tip stall.|$|E

Swiftly my thoughts ran--bad luck was nothing--a man had only to stick at a thing--what a fine, sharp, wonderful day for adventure! How the hounds bayed! Had R.C. sighted a bear somewhere below?

Leaping the ruts, bounding like a sheep from rock to rock, I covered my back tracks. All inside me seemed to flutter, yet I felt cold and hard--a sickening sense of reproach that I had left my brother in a bad position. Spang! His fifth and last shot followed swiftly after the fourth--too swift to be accurate. So hurriedly a man would act in close quarters. R.C. now had an empty rifle!... Like a flash I crossed that slope leading to the rocks, and tore around the cliff at such speed that it was a wonder I did not <b>pitch</b> <b>down</b> and break my neck.
