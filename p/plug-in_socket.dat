40|$|There is a {{trend in}} the optical {{industry}} to automate the edge-blackening of optical components. The goal of edge-blackening is to coat the areas outside the functional region of optical components, namely the peripheral areas including the surface edge or "diaphragm" and apertures, with light absorbing, index-matched material to minimise scattering light. The common method today is the manual application with brush or ink-writer of quick-drying liquid pigmented synthetic resin. The lenses are fitted at a rotary table with a vacuum-pump or with <b>plug-in</b> <b>socket.</b> The increasing diversity of components and the decreasing quantity of batch size are a considerable disadvantage inhibiting the automation. Another problem {{is the use of}} a high number of lacquers with different or partly unknown properties, due to varying chemical bases. There were developed some automatic techniques to black the optical components: airbrush, microdispensation, application by a canula. The optical and mechanical p roperties of the lacquer were investigated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—By {{applying}} the latest technologies in image compression {{for managing the}} storage of massive image data within cultural heritage databases and by exploiting the universality of the Internet we are now able not only to effectively digitize, record and preserve, but also to promote the dissemination of cultural heritage. In this work we present an application of the latest image compression standard JPEG 2000 in managing and browsing image databases, focusing on the image transmission aspect rather than database management and indexing. We combine the technologies of JPEG 2000 image compression with client-server socket connections and client browser plug-in, as to provide with an all-in-one package for remote browsing of JPEG 2000 compressed image databases, suitable for the effective dissemination of cultural heritage. Index Terms—JPEG 2000, image compression, progressive coding, progressive transmission, <b>plug-ins,</b> <b>sockets,</b> client-server, cultural image databases.

40|$|Over the years, {{with the}} rapid {{advancement}} of technology, the internet is increasingly becoming {{an integral part of}} our lives. When starting to create new tourist sites, parks and other public spaces, {{it is very important to}} invest in comfort zones for people and make it possible to make free use of the internet in the public environment. The aim of this work is to carry out the design and characterization of the high-performance outdoor internet router's complex plastic housing and compare its production costs in Lithuania and abroad. In the work according to the injection molding production requirements, an integrated field-to-Internet router's integrated body with a <b>plug-in</b> <b>socket</b> has been designed. Designing takes into account the design of the sealing and fastening hooks and adapt the design principles. Depending on the water absorption test and the analysis of the materials, the acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer and polycarbonate polymer blend are selected because of its low water absorption, good resistance to ultraviolet rays, a wide operating temperature range, and excellent impact resistance. The paper compiled a computer-based spatial model of the routing box body, carried out a strength analysis of the PCB board for fixing hooks, which revealed that the most vulnerable zone of the knife is the tie-down between the stiffening wall and the hook. After comparative analysis of the costs of manufacturing injection molding in a complex building in Lithuania and abroad, it has been established that at present, Lithuanian companies are highly competitive in terms of price, quality and transportation, and therefore it is recommended to produce a complex housing in Lithuania...|$|E
