40|$|In {{the early}} 1970 's a program was {{initiated}} at the Naval Surface Warfare Center/Indian Head Division (NSWC/IHDIV) {{to address the}} well-known problems associated with availability and suppliers of critical ingredients. These critical ingredients are necessary for preparation of solid propellants and explosives manufactured by the Navy. The objective {{of the program was}} to identify primary and secondary (or back-up) vendor information for these critical ingredients, and to develop suitable alternative materials if an ingredient is unavailable. In 1992 NSWC/IHDIV funded Chemical Propulsion Information Agency (CPIA) under a Technical Area Task (TAT) to expedite the task of creating a database listing critical ingredients used to manufacture Navy propellant and explosives based on known formulation quantities. Under this task CPIA provided employees that were 100 percent dedicated to the task of obtaining critical ingredient suppliers information, selecting the software and designing the interface between the computer program and the database users. TAT objectives included creating the Explosive Ingredients Source Database (EISD) for <b>Propellant,</b> <b>Explosive</b> and Pyrotechnic (PEP) critical elements. The goal was to create a readily accessible database, to provide users a quick-view summary of critical ingredient supplier's information and create a centralized archive that CPIA would update and distribute. EISD funding ended in 1996. At that time, the database entries included 53 formulations and 108 critical used to manufacture Navy propellant and explosives. CPIA turned the database tasking back over to NSWC/IHDIV to maintain and distribute at their discretion. Due to significant interest in propellant/explosives critical ingredients suppliers' status, the Propellant Development and Characterization Subcommittee (PDCS) approached the JANNAF Executive committee (EC) for authorization to continue the critical ingredient database work. In 1999, JANNAF EC approved the PDCS panel task. This paper is designed to emphasize the necessity of maintaining a JANNAF community supported database, which monitors PEP critical ingredient suppliers' status. The final product of this task is a user friendly, searchable database that provides a quick-view summary of critical ingredient supplier's information. This database must be designed to serve the needs of JANNAF and the propellant and energetic commercial manufacturing community as well.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{combustion}} {{of the new}} solid nitrate ester 2, 3 -hydroxymethyl- 2, 3 -dinitro- 1, 4 -butanediol tetranitrate (SMX, C 6 H 8 N 6 O 16). SMX was synthesized {{for the first time}} in 2008. It has a melting point of 85 °C and oxygen balance of 0 % to CO 2, allowing it to be used as an energetic additive or oxidizer in solid propellants. In addition to its neat combustion characteristics, this work also explores the use of SMX as a potential replacement for nitroglycerin (NG) in double base gun propellants and as a replacement for ammonium perchlorate in composite rocket propellants. ^ The physical properties, sensitivity characteristics, and combustion behaviors of neat SMX were investigated. Its combustion is stable at pressures of up to at least 27. 5 MPa (n = 0. 81). The observed flame structure is nearly identical to that of other double base propellant ingredients, with a primary flame attached at the surface, a thick isothermal dark zone, and a luminous secondary flame wherein final recombination reactions occur. As a result, the burning rate and primary flame structure can be modeled using existing one-dimensional steady state techniques. A zero gas-phase activation energy approximation results in a good fit between modeled and observed behavior. ^ Additionally, SMX was considered as a replacement for nitroglycerin in a double base propellant. Thermochemical calculations indicate improved performance when compared with the common double base propellant JA 2 at SMX loadings above 40 wt-%. Also, since SMX is a room temperature solid, migration may be avoided. Like other nitrate esters, SMX is susceptible to decomposition over long-term storage due to the presence of excess acid in the crystals; the addition of stabilizers (e. g., derivatives of urea) during synthesis should be sufficient to prevent this. the addition of Both unplasticized and plasticized propellants were formulated. Thermal analysis of unplasticized propellant showed a distinct melt-recrystallization curve, which indicates that a solid phase solution is being formed between SMX and NC, and that SMX would not act as plasticizer. Analysis of propellant prepared with diethyleneglycol dinitrate (DEGDN) plasticizer indicates that the SMX is likely dissolved in the DEGDN. The plasticized material also showed similar hardness and modulus to JA 2. However, both plasticized and unplasticized propellants exhibited deconsolidated burning at elevated pressures due to the high modulus of the propellant. Increased amounts of plasticizer or improved processing of the nitrocellulose should be investigated to remedy this issue. Safety characterization showed that sensitivity of the plasticized propellant is similar to JA 2. In short, replacing NG with SMX results in a new family of propellants with acceptable safety characteristics and which may also offer improved theoretical performance. ^ Finally, composite propellants based on SMX were theoretically and experimentally examined and compared to formulations based on ammonium perchlorate (AP). Thermochemical equilibrium calculations show that aluminized SMX-based formulations can achieve theoretical sea level specific impulse values upwards of 260 s– slightly lower than an AP-based composite. Both ignition sensitivity (tested via drop weight impact, electro-static discharge, and BAM friction) and physical properties (hardness and thermal properties) are comparable to those of the AP-based formulations. However, the SMX-based formulation could be detonated using a high explosive donor charge in contact with the propellant, as do other low smoke propellants. Differential scanning calorimetry of the SMX-based propellant indicated an exotherm onset of 140 °C, which corresponds to the known decomposition temperature of SMX. The propellant has a high burning rate of 1. 57 cm/s at 6. 89 MPa, with a pressure exponent of 0. 85. This high pressure sensitivity might be addressed using various energetic and/or stabilizing additives. ^ With high density and performance, smokeless combustion products, and stable combustion, SMX appears to be a viable replacement for existing energetic ingredients in a wide variety of <b>propellant,</b> <b>explosive,</b> and pyrotechnic applications. ...|$|E
