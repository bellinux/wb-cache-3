Flight370 was a scheduled commercial flight with 227 passengers and 12 crew which departed Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at 0:41 and was scheduled to land in Beijing, China at 6:30China Standard Time (6:30MYT; 22:30UTC, 7 March). Malaysia has worked in conjunction with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to co-ordinate the analysis, which has also involved the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Inmarsat, and US National Transportation Safety Board, among others. Others have also made efforts to analyse the satellite communications, albeit challenged by a lack of publicly available information for several months after the disappearance. On 29July 2015, debris was discovered on Réunion Island which was later confirmed to come from Flight 370; it is the first physical evidence that Flight370 ended in the Indian Ocean.|$|E

25|$|Soviet {{documents}} declassified in March 2003 {{showed that}} the KGB had conducted their own investigation of the accident, in addition to one government and two military investigations. The KGB's report dismissed various conspiracy theories, instead indicating that the actions of airbase personnel contributed to the crash. The report states that an air traffic controller provided Gagarin with outdated weather information, and {{that by the time}} of his flight, conditions had deteriorated significantly. Ground crew also left external fuel tanks attached to the aircraft. Gagarin's <b>planned</b> <b>flight</b> activities needed clear weather and no outboard tanks. The investigation concluded that Gagarin's aircraft entered a spin, either due to a bird strike or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft. Because of the out-of-date weather report, the crew believed their altitude to be higher than it actually was, and could not react properly to bring the MiG-15 out of its spin.|$|E

25|$|NASA {{initially}} {{planned to}} withdraw Atlantis from service in 2008, as the orbiter {{would have been}} due to undergo its third scheduled OMDP.

However, with the significant <b>planned</b> <b>flight</b> schedule up to 2010, the decision was taken to extend the time between OMDPs, allowing Atlantis to be retained for operations. Atlantis was subsequently swapped for one flight of each Discovery and Endeavour in the flight manifest. Atlantis had completed what was meant to be its last flight, STS-132, prior to the end of the shuttle program, but the extension of the Shuttle program into 2011 led to Atlantis being selected for STS-135, the final Space Shuttle mission in July 2011.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringDale E. SchinstockThe {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop methods and tools for generating <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A method of generating <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> is needed to describe data collection missions, such as taking aerial photographs. The <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> are two-dimensional and exist in a plane a fixed distance above the Earth. Since the flight areas are typically small, the Earth's curvature is not accounted for in <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> generation. Designed to completely cover a specified field area, the plans consist of a series of line and arc segments and are described in a format that is recognized by the Piccolo autopilot used by the Kansas State University Autonomous Vehicle Systems (AVS) Lab. Grids are designed to cover the field area, and turn maneuvers are designed to ensure efficient <b>flight</b> <b>plans.</b> The <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> generation process is broken into several parts. Once a field area is defined, path lines covering this area are calculated. Optimal turn maneuvers are calculated to smoothly connect the path lines in a continuous <b>flight</b> <b>plan.</b> Two methods of determining path line order are discussed. One method flies the lines in the order that they are arranged spatially; the other method decides line order by calculating the shortest turn maneuver to another path line. After the <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> is generated, a text file is created in a format that is readable for the autopilot. In order to easily generate <b>flight</b> <b>plans,</b> a graphical user interface (GUI) has been created. This GUI allows a user to easily generate a <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> without modifying any code. The <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> generation software is used to build example <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> for this thesis.

500|$|During {{his time}} in Canada, Worsley had made the {{acquaintance}} of a young Canadian, Grettir Algarsson, who was of Icelandic descent and was preparing a ship for a voyage to the Arctic. Algarsson's voyage proved short-lived, as his ship collided with floating wreckage while in the North Sea. Undeterred, he set about preparing an expedition for the following year and invited Worsley, who had provided advice for his previous voyage, to join him. The plan was to sail to Spitzbergen, in the Arctic Circle, and Algarsson was to fly {{from there to the}} North Pole where he would crash the plane, and, with his pilot, sledge back. Worsley was to captain the ship that Algarsson had purchased for the expedition, a [...] diesel-engined brigatine called the Island. A lack of funds resulted in the cancellation of the <b>planned</b> <b>flight</b> as a suitable plane could not be found. However, the 15-man expedition, known as the Algarsson North Polar Expedition, went ahead with certain mapping and scientific objectives, among them a search for Gillis Land, northeast of Spitzbergen, which had not been sighted since 1707, as well as sounding the continental shelf between Spitzbergen and Franz Josef Land. [...] With the plane flight no longer viable, and the focus of the expedition now primarily on maritime matters, Algarsson offered Worsley co-leadership of the expedition, which he accepted.
