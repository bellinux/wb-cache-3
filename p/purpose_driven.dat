5|$|What's So Amazing About Grace? sold well at {{secular and}} Christian stores. Its {{popularity}} in the United Kingdom grew in 2003, when the impending Iraq War boosted sales of religious literature in the country. That March, it was the seventh-bestselling religious book in the UK, behind Rick Warren's The <b>Purpose</b> <b>Driven</b> Life, John Ortberg's If You Want to Walk on Water, You've Got to Get Out of the Boat and Eugene H. Peterson's The Message. What's So Amazing About Grace? is Yancey's best-known book, having sold more than 15million copies by 2006. Initially, the book was especially popular among baby boomers. Its popularity helped increase sales of Yancey's 2000 book Reaching for the Invisible God, which appeared on religion bestseller lists immediately after publication. What's So Amazing About Grace? {{is one of several}} books by Yancey that have become international bestsellers.|$|E

500|$|Christians of many {{denominations}} treat What's So Amazing About Grace? as a handbook. In it, Yancey {{coined the}} phrase [...] "scandal of grace", {{referring to the}} idea that God may choose to forgive people who have done evil deeds, citing the conversion of Paul the Apostle who was persecuting Christians. The phrase [...] "scandal of grace" [...] has become widely used in Christian circles. In 2005, the Barna Group, a California-based research firm, asked senior pastors across the United States which books they had found helpful during the past three years. What's So Amazing About Grace? was one of nine books mentioned by at least two percent of the respondents; the other eight included Rick Warren's The <b>Purpose</b> <b>Driven</b> Church and The <b>Purpose</b> <b>Driven</b> Life and John C. Maxwell's The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership.|$|E

500|$|Shortly afterwards, Wallace {{became a}} spiritualist. At {{about the same}} time, he began to {{maintain}} that natural selection cannot account for mathematical, artistic, or musical genius, as well as metaphysical musings, and wit and humour. He eventually said that something in [...] "the unseen universe of Spirit" [...] had interceded {{at least three times}} in history. The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter. The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals. And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in humankind. He also believed that the [...] of the universe was the development of the human spirit. These views greatly disturbed Darwin, who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that sexual selection could easily explain apparently non-adaptive mental phenomena. While some historians have concluded that Wallace's belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism, other Wallace scholars have disagreed, and some maintain that Wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas. Reaction to Wallace's ideas on this topic among leading naturalists at the time varied. Charles Lyell endorsed Wallace's views on human evolution rather than Darwin's. Wallace's belief that human consciousness could not be entirely a product of purely material causes was shared by a number of prominent intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, many, including Huxley, Hooker, and Darwin himself, were critical of Wallace. As the historian of science Michael Shermer has stated, Wallace's views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of the emerging Darwinian philosophy, which were that evolution was not teleological (<b>purpose</b> <b>driven)</b> and that it was not anthropocentric (human-centred). Much later in his life Wallace returned to these themes, that evolution suggested that the universe might have a purpose and that certain aspects of living organisms might not be explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes, in a 1909 magazine article entitled The World of Life, which he later expanded into a book of the same name; a work that Shermer said anticipated some ideas about design in nature and directed evolution that would arise from various religious traditions throughout the 20th century.|$|E

However, less is known about the origins of national accounting and the disagreements over its fundamental purpose and design.

50|$|At {{the heart}} of the matter is {{scientific}} hubris. Bateson argues that Occidental epistemology perpetuates a system of understanding which is <b>purpose</b> or means-to-an-end <b>driven.</b> <b>Purpose</b> controls attention and narrows perception, thus limiting what comes into consciousness and therefore limiting the amount of wisdom that can be generated from the perception. Additionally Occidental epistemology propagates the false notion that man exists outside Mind and this leads man to believe in what Bateson calls the philosophy of control based upon false knowledge.|$|R

40|$|The {{accounting}} literature frequently publishes {{articles that}} establish the adoption rates of accounting information systems, {{such as the}} Balanced Scorecard (BSC) or Activity-Based Costing, and subsequently examines the factors that drive this adoption. However, much less {{is known about the}} specific purposes for which these systems are used. In this paper, I examine the purposes for which managers use the Balanced Scorecard. Data was collected from a survey administered in 19 Dutch firms which had indicated that they used a BSC. The survey resulted in 224 responses from individual managers. Using exploratory factor analysis on Doll and Torkzadeh's [Doll, W. J., Torkzadeh, G., 1998. Developing a multidimensional measure of system-use in an organizational context. Information and Management 33, 171 - 185. ] instrument of multidimensional MIS usage, I find that managers use the BSC for: (1) decision-making and decision-rationalizing; (2) coordination; and (3) self-monitoring. In the second step, I consider drivers of BSC usage for the three different purposes. These drivers are dimensions of evaluation style, alternative controls that are used in the organizational unit, and the receptiveness of managers to new types of information. I find that BSC usage for decision-making and decision-rationalizing <b>purposes</b> is <b>driven</b> by the degree of action controls used and manager's receptiveness to new information types. BSC usage for coordination <b>purposes</b> is <b>driven</b> by the emphasis placed on managerial evaluation of subordinates and the manager's receptiveness to new types of information. Finally, BSC usage for self-monitoring <b>purposes</b> is <b>driven</b> by the emphasis placed on managerial evaluation. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

This paper will model the manner in which one school developed and integrated the teaching of grammar, from a functional perspective, into existing literacy session routines. In particular, the paper details how a dialogic approach (Alexander, 2008) and a framework of games-based pedagogies were used in the Early Years classrooms within the context of an author study. The paper demonstrates high levels of student engagement with the functionally oriented grammar content and details their new knowledge and understandings through peer interactions and their written work...|$|R
