50|$|Malleable iron is cast {{as white}} iron, the {{structure}} being a metastable carbide in a pearlitic matrix. Through an annealing heat treatment, the brittle structure as first cast {{is transformed into}} the malleable form. Carbon agglomerates into small roughly spherical aggregates of graphite leaving a matrix of ferrite or pearlite according to the exact heat treatment used. Three basic types of malleable iron are recognized within the casting industry: blackheart malleable iron, whiteheart malleable iron and <b>pearlitic</b> <b>malleable</b> <b>iron.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Malleable</b> <b>iron</b> {{was used}} {{as early as the}} 4th century BCE, and <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> {{artifacts}} have been discovered by archaeologists between 4th century BCE and 9th century CE in China. By the Tang Dynasty, the use of <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> in China waned, although there are <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> artifacts dating to the 9th century. <b>Malleable</b> <b>iron</b> is mentioned in England in a patent dating to the 1670s. Réaumur conducted extensive research on <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> in 1720. He discovered that iron castings which were too hard to be worked could be softened by packing them into iron ore or hammer slag and exposing them to high temperature for a number of days. Creating <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> began in the United States in 1826 when Seth Boyden started a foundry for the production of harness hardware and other small castings.|$|R
40|$|<b>Malleable</b> <b>iron</b> {{lost the}} {{interest}} and the development stopped in the turbulent seventies of tremendous developments of new technologies. The personal computer, emission spectrometer, thermal analysis, cold-box core system and automatic vertical moulding were introduced into the foundry industry. Experience shows that these new technologies do not always match up with <b>malleable</b> <b>iron.</b> Solidification and mould filling simulation programs are not always capable to handle a low carbon equivalent <b>iron</b> like <b>malleable</b> <b>iron.</b> Recent developments show however by using these new technologies and combined with practical experience, {{it is possible to}} increase the casting yield of <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> to the same level as ductile iron. The mechanical properties, especially the yield strength of <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> according to the standard are equivalent to those of ductile iron, however the yield strength of oil quenched <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> is significantly higher than that of ductile iron. An extensive investigation is made between ductile iron, air quenched and oil quenched <b>malleable</b> <b>irons</b> based on the properties of more than 350 test bars produced under the same conditions. The results are compared with the existing international standards and discussed. Other properties like fatigue strength and response to surface treatments as induction hardening are also discussed. The costs of <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> are reviewed and compared with other ferro alloys. These recent developments in increasing the casting yield, the understanding of the strength, makes <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> competitive with ductile iron and cheaper than the first grade of ausferritic ductile iron, or steel qualities. It is possible to design lighter and save weight which is essential in the automotive industry. An example of “green cast” development for typical applications, used in automotive transmissions and engines are shown...|$|R

5000|$|Like similar irons {{with the}} carbon formed into spherical or nodular shapes, <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> {{exhibits}} good ductility. Incorrectly {{considered by some}} to be an [...] "old" [...] or [...] "dead" [...] material, <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> still has a legitimate place in the design engineer's toolbox. <b>Malleable</b> <b>iron</b> is a good choice for small castings or castings with thin cross sections (less than 0.25 inch, 6.35 mm). Other nodular irons produced with graphite in the spherical shape can be difficult to produce in these applications, due to the formation of carbides from the rapid cooling.|$|R

50|$|The M&KR used stone block {{sleepers}} with Birkinshaw's patent <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> rails. At {{this early}} date {{the technology of}} rail configuration had not matured, but John Birkinshaw had secured a patent in 1820 for a T-section fish-bellied edge rail of <b>malleable</b> <b>iron.</b> His patent specified {{that they should be}} formed by passing through rollers—as they were fish-bellied, presumably only the head was shaped in the rollers. Cast iron, as used until then, is brittle and ill-suited to heavy railway use; <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> is heat treated after casting and is able to withstand shocks. The Stockton and Darlington Railway was the first public railway to adopt Birkinshaw's rail; the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway was either the second or the third public railway.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} of microstructure and mechanical properties of <b>malleable</b> cast <b>iron</b> using metal casting process. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the influence of different annealing rate to the mechanical properties and microstructure of <b>malleable</b> cast <b>iron.</b> The thesis describes the proper sand casting process in order to investigate the effect on microstructure and mechanical properties of <b>malleable</b> cast <b>iron.</b> The CO 2 sand {{was used as the}} mould and pig iron as the raw material to produce <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> in this thesis. The studies of mechanical properties that are involved in this thesis consists of hardness, tensile strength, percent of elongation, carbon content, and the composition of <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> before and after metal casting process. Three different annealing rate was used {{in order to determine the}} correlation between mechanical properties and microstructure of <b>malleable</b> cast <b>iron.</b> As result, we observed that as the annealing rate increases, ductility of the samples also increased but compromising with hardness and strength. The microstructure shows graphite nodules in the samples, however it decreases the strength and percent of elongation. As for the recommendation, the mechanical properties including the wear, corrosion resistance, impact resistance, and noise reduction should be considered in order to optimally select a material for its specific application...|$|R

50|$|In 1869 Alfred Pope {{left the}} family {{business}} and, with loans from his brother-in-law Joshua Brooks and others, bought into the Cleveland <b>Malleable</b> <b>Iron</b> Company, a concern which had been formed a year earlier by five Cleveland men.

He was also involved with several other manufacturing enterprises and financial institutions.
