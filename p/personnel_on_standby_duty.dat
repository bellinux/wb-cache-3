50|$|In {{countries}} such as Canada and the United States, the term 'motor lifeboat', or its US military acronym MLB, is used to designate shore-based rescue lifeboats which are generally manned by full-time coast guard service <b>personnel.</b> <b>On</b> <b>standby</b> rather than <b>on</b> patrol mode these vessels are ready for service rather like a crew of fire fighters standing by for an alert. In Canada, some lifeboats are 'co-crewed', meaning that the operator and engineer are full-time personnel while the crew members are trained volunteers.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the short}} term nature of these operations, they were often {{unsustainable}} and had limited success. To counter this, the Rapid Deployment Unit {{was set up in}} 2000. The Unit receives support through additional tactical training by the U.S. Marines. As a result, it has specifically trained and prepared <b>personnel</b> <b>on</b> <b>standby,</b> who possess ready supplies, transport and support materiel for deployment. The unit receives regular training and refresher courses. It operates independently of Administration Police in their area of deployment, and so it does not affect normal operations.|$|R

Not long after, a hurricane watch was issued for coastal areas extending from Panama City, Florida to Vermilion Bay in Louisiana. Although forecasts showed that Frederic posed no threat to Sarasota, Florida, the city readied barrels of water if distribution was necessitated to Sarasota County's 58emergency shelters.

50|$|Immediately {{following}} Rusty's landfall, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services placed 30 <b>personnel</b> <b>on</b> <b>standby</b> {{and began}} aerial surveys {{to determine if}} residents needed aid. Residents in Pilbara were warned {{of the dangers of}} asbestos in damaged or destroyed structures in early March as they were allowed to return home. A week after Rusty passed through Pilbara, an algal bloom the size of Tasmania appeared offshore. Unprecedented turbidity from the storm stirred up a large column of nutrients from the seafloor and brought it to the surface, causing the rapid increase in algae. Despite its size, it was not expected to have any lasting effects in the region.|$|R
50|$|The {{allocation}} at Camberwell decreased {{slightly over}} the years from 165 in 1952 until the closure of Walworth garage in 1985 increased the allocation to 142.

50|$|Due to {{problems}} experienced with No. 26 whilst at Hebburn {{that required the}} hiring of a South Maitland Railways locomotive and since that SMR was short of locos due {{to the state of}} their loco fleet at the time, JABAS purchased 4-6-4T 3013 from the New South Wales Department of Railways. This locomotive was built by Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1903 (builder's No. 4456). This loco was delivered to Hebburn Colliery at Weston on 15 May 1967, where it remained until the closure of Hebburn No. 2 Colliery in June 1972 when it was transferred to Hexham on 12 July 1972. It was regularly used on duties at Hexham until the arrival of the second SMR Ten class loco in May 1973, when it was used mainly <b>on</b> <b>standby</b> <b>duties</b> until being stored in 1976. In 1981 the loco was sold to the Lachlan Valley Railway, where it was dismantled for overhaul. In October 2009 the dismantled loco was transferred to the Canberra Railway Museum.|$|R

40|$|Sewage is {{generated}} by human activities continuously. As the population increases in the country, the quantities of sewage also increases every year. Many sewage systems were introduced {{in the country to}} protect the health of human and environment. From the year 1993, the sewage system in Malaysia has been given to the private management. Now, it is Indah Water Konsortium Sdn. Bhd. 's (IWK) responsibility to manage the sewage systems in the country. This study was conducted to study the sewage management needs in Kuantan from the year 2013 to year 2020. The objectives of this study are to study the sewage management system used in Kuantan through community perception, to identify the problems faced by IWK Kuantan in sewage management and to recommend improvements to the existing sewage management system. The information collected for this study was obtained from IWK and several housing areas in Kuantan. The information included in this study were new and old sewage systems used in Kuantan and how IWK manage the problems in sewage management. As a conclusion, IWK in Kuantan is responsible for improvements to the sewage management in Kuantan. Therefore, IWK should provide <b>personnel</b> <b>on</b> <b>standby</b> during weekends and public holidays to handle any problems that may crop up. Thus, it can provide good quality sewerage and protect the health of both humans and the environment...|$|R

On 8 June, she debarked these units at Puerta de Andres, Dominican Republic and loaded other Army units for a voyage back to the east coast. She returned to Little Creek on 15 June, but {{before the end of}} the year completed three more Caribbean deployments; 13 August to 15 September 25 October to 10 November, and 18 November to 8 December.

Since schools would be turned into evacuation centers, Candelario Viola, the mayor of Hinatuan, ordered the suspension of all classes in the town. Mar Roxas, the Interior and Local Government Secretary, said that National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council’s disaster monitoring systems were set up in several regions across the Philippines. [...] "In accordance with President PNoy’s marching orders to ensure zero casualties from disasters, as much as possible, I have ordered our regional directors {{to make sure that}} the necessary precautions are undertaken to mitigate the effects of Tropical Storm Bopha," [...] he said. [...] "We have our existing protocols, and it is just a matter of implementing them and making other necessary preparations as appropriate." [...] Roxas added. As preparations continued, Storm signal number 1 was declared over Siquijor, Bohol, Biliran, Camotes Island, Cebu Southern Leyte, Leyte, Eastern Samar, Western Samar, Surigao del Norte, Siargao Island, Dinagat Island, Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, rest of Davao Oriental, Davaol del Norte including Samal Island, Compostela Valley, Bukidnon, Misamis Occidental, Misamis oriental, Camiguin, Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur. Also, signal number 2 was raised over Surigao del Sur and the northern part of Davao Oriental.

50|$|Early in Pam's history, a {{damaging}} {{storm surge}} was felt in Tuvalu, forcing {{a state of}} emergency declaration after 45 percent of the nation's residents were displaced. Torrential rainfall occurred in the southeastern Solomon Islands, particularly in the Santa Cruz Islands. In Vanuatu, all emergency centers were activated and relief <b>personnel</b> were put <b>on</b> <b>standby</b> with Pam assessed as having the potential {{to be one of the}} nation's worst tropical cyclones. Catastrophic damage occurred as the storm moved through the archipelago, particularly in Efate, location of the Ni-Vanuatu capital of Port Vila; and the Tafea islands of Erromango and Tanna. The cyclone crippled Vanuatu's infrastructure: an estimated 90 percent of the nation's buildings were impacted by the storm's effects, telecommunications were paralyzed, and water shortages continue to plague the small nation. Pam later brought heavy winds and rough surf to New Zealand's North Island during its weakening stages.|$|R

40|$|The Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Main Electronics Module (MEM) {{power supply}} heat sink {{temperature}} {{is critical to}} the Landsat- 7 mission. It is strongly dependent on the thermal louver design. A lower power supply heat sink temperature increases the reliability of the MEM, and reduces the risk of over heating and thermal shut-down. After the power supply failures in ETM+ instrument thermal vacuum tests # 1 and # 2, the author performed detailed thermal analyses of the MEM, and proposed to reduce the louver set-points by 7 C. At the 1998 Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference (IECEC), the author presented a paper that included results of thermal analysis of the MEM. It showed that a 70 C reduction of the louver set points could reduce the maximum power supply heat sink temperature in thermal vacuum test and in flight to below 20 "C in the cooler outgas mode and in the nominal imaging mode, and has no significant impact <b>on</b> the <b>standby</b> heater <b>duty</b> cycle. It also showed that the effect of Earth infrared and albedo on the power supply heat sink temperature is small. The louver set point reduction was implemented in June 1998, just prior to ETM+ thermal vacuum test # 3. Results of the thermal vacuum tests, and temperature data in flight validate the MEM thermal performance improvement due to the 70 C reduction of the louver set points...|$|R
