5|$|In April 1952 Sihanouk married Paule Monique Izzi, the {{daughter}} of <b>Pomme</b> Peanga Cambodian lady, and Jean-François Izzi, a French banker of Italian ancestry. Monique became Sihanouk's lifelong partner, and in the 1990s she changed her name to Monineath. Before his marriage to Monique, Sihanouk had married five other women including Phat Kanhol, Sisowath Pongsanmoni, Sisowath Monikessan, Mam Manivan Phanivong, and Thavet Norleak. Monikessan died of childbirth in 1946, and his marriages to the other women all ended in divorce. Sihanouk sired fourteen children with five different wives except for Thavet Norleak, who bore him no children. During the Khmer Rouge years, five children and fourteen grandchildren disappeared; Sihanouk believed they {{were killed by the}} Khmer Rouge.|$|E
50|$|Similar potato sides {{that can}} be used instead of <b>pommes</b> dauphine include <b>pommes</b> noisette, <b>pommes</b> {{duchesse}} or <b>pommes</b> soufflées. <b>Pommes</b> dauphines are unique, however, in that they are made from choux pastry, which gives them a lighter density. <b>Pommes</b> noisette have a similar round shape but are only made of potato and are significantly smaller.|$|R
25|$|The thick-cut fries {{are called}} <b>Pommes</b> Pont-Neuf or simply <b>pommes</b> frites (about 10mm); thinner {{variants}} are <b>pommes</b> allumettes (matchstick potatoes; about 7mm), and <b>pommes</b> paille (potato straws; 3–4mm). (Roughly 0.4, 0.3 and 0.15 inch respectively.) <b>Pommes</b> gaufrettes are waffle fries. A popular dish in France is steak-frites, which is steak accompanied by thin French fries.|$|R

5|$|The East Plains Trail {{followed}} the older routes of the West Plains Trail from Pembina to Breckenridge, Minnesota, then struck east {{by a variety}} of routes out of the Red River Valley across the upper valleys of the <b>Pomme</b> de Terre and Chippewa Rivers (tributaries of the Minnesota River), to Saint Cloud and Sauk Rapids on the Upper Mississippi. Soon however, a branch was added to connect the East Plains Trail with the Woods Trail. This link skirted the west slope of the Leaf Mountains and joined the East Plains routes at Elbow Lake or near the Otter Tail River. At times, this eastern connection may have been the better-travelled of the two variants.|$|E

25|$|The Lake of the Ozarks, <b>Pomme</b> de Terre Lake, and Truman Lake in the {{northern}} Ozarks were formed by impounding the Osage River and its tributary the <b>Pomme</b> de Terre River in 1931, 1961 and 1979 respectively. Grand Lake in northeast Oklahoma was created in 1940. Stockton Lake was formed by damming the Sac River {{near the city of}} Stockton, Missouri in 1969 and supplements the water supply of Springfield in nearby Greene County. Most of the dams were built for the dual purpose of flood control and hydropower generation.|$|E

25|$|The {{village was}} built on hillsides and is {{dominated}} by Fort Napoleon. The village has a post office, a city hall, a chapel and a police station {{as well as a}} grocery, a bakery, and two galleries. In 2017 a pizzeria will be opening. The port area houses the office of the Capitaine du Port, a clothing store and small general store. In between there is a bazaar (Le Bazar d'Héliopolis) offering food, hardware, a tabac and cafe bar. There are a number of hotels and bed-and-breakfasts, and seven restaurants (Le Gecko, La Fourmi, La Palmeraie, La Gambaro, Héliotel, Le Minimum, La <b>Pomme</b> d'Adam), all catering for naturists.|$|E
25|$|The word entered Late Middle English in {{the fourteenth}} century via Old French orenge (in the phrase <b>pomme</b> d'orenge). The French word, in turn, comes from Old Provençal auranja, based on Arabic nāranj. In several languages, the initial n present in earlier forms of the word dropped off because {{it may have been}} mistaken as part of an {{indefinite}} article ending in an n sound—in French, for example, une norenge may have been heard as une orenge. This linguistic change is called juncture loss. The color was named after the fruit, and the first recorded use of orange as a color name in English was in 1512.|$|E
25|$|Lambic {{with the}} {{addition}} of raspberry (framboise), peach (pêche), blackcurrant (cassis), grape (druif), or strawberry (aardbei), as either whole fruit or syrup. Other, rarer fruit lambic flavorings include apple (<b>pomme),</b> banana (banane), pineapple (ananas), apricot (abricot), plum (prune), cloudberry (plaquebière), lemon (citron), and blueberry (myrtille). Fruit lambics are usually bottled with secondary fermentation. Although fruit lambics are among the most famous Belgian fruit beers, the use of names such as kriek, framboise or frambozen, cassis, etc. does not necessarily imply that the beer is made from lambic. The fruit beers produced by the Liefmans Brewery, for example, use an oud bruin, rather than a lambic as a base.|$|E

25|$|On 9 May 1945, , {{which had}} set out from Plymouth, arrived in Jersey to accept the {{surrender}} of the occupying forces. Two naval officers, Surgeon Lieutenant Ronald McDonald and Sub Lieutenant R Milne, were met by the Harbour Master who escorted them to the Harbour Master's Office where they together hoisted the Union Flag, before also raising it on the flagstaff of the <b>Pomme</b> D'Or Hotel. This has been re-enacted every year on Liberation Day since 1995. From 2003 to 2011 Harbour Master and Jerseyman Captain Howard Le Cornu performed this annually. His father John E. Le Cornu and uncle David M. Le Cornu {{had been in the}} crowds and had witnessed the occasion on 9 May 1945.|$|E
25|$|His {{admiration for}} Molière found {{expression}} in the stanzas addressed to him (1663) {{and in the second}} satire (1664). In 1664 he composed his prose Dialogue sur les héros de roman, a satire on the elaborate romances of the time, which may be said to have once for all abolished the lucubrations of La Calprenède, Mlle de Scudéry and their fellows. Though fairly widely read in manuscript, the book was not published till 1713, out of regard, it is said, for Mlle de Scudéry. To these early days belong the reunions at the Mouton Blanc and the <b>Pomme</b> du Pin, where Boileau, Molière, Jean Racine, Jean de La Chapelle and Antoine Furetière met to discuss literary questions. To Molière and Racine he proved a constant friend, and supported their interests on many occasions.|$|E
25|$|Teutschbein {{has been}} the KKB's musical {{director}} since February, 2007, and his first joint project with the choir was to organize the sixth EJCF in May, 2007, in Basel. In September, the choir appeared in the Jugendkulturfestival Basel ("Basel Youth Culture Festival") as well as The Glue's Lala Blabla <b>Pomme</b> d'Adam Festival. In January, 2008, Handel's Messiah was performed with the Berner Freitagsakademie in the original English with great success; in March, there followed a concert tour through Hungary with four more Messiah concerts, one of {{which took place in}} Matthias Church in Budapest. In the fall, the choirboys participated in an open-air production of Orff's Carmina Burana. In October, 2008, the changed voices performed Luigi Cherubini's Requiem in D Minor for men's chorus in the Basel Münster and in the music hall of Stadtcasino Basel; the concert was rounded out by César Franck's Psalm 150 and Georges Bizet's Te Deum.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the next}} year and a half, Paterson and Weston {{continued}} to produce [...] "new" [...] material. This led to intense disagreements with Big Life and the Orb soon left the label to sign a deal with Island Records. Their first release on Island Records was the live album Live 93, which gathered highlights from their recent performances in Europe and Asia. It featured the live crew of Paterson, Weston, producers Nick Burton and Simon Phillips, as well as audio engineer Andy Hughes, who had stepped in previously when Weston had decided to stop touring. The Orb's first studio production on Island Records was <b>Pomme</b> Fritz, a chaotic EP noted for its heavy use of strange samples and its lack of conventional harmonies. Though <b>Pomme</b> Fritz reached [...] #6 on the British charts, critics panned it as [...] "doodling". Island Records [...] "hated it" [...] and [...] "didn't understand it at all", according to Paterson. Soon after production finished on <b>Pomme</b> Fritz, Paterson, Weston, and Orb contributor Thomas Fehlmann joined with Robert Fripp to form the group FFWD as a side project. FFWD released a single self-titled album on Paterson's Inter-Modo label, which Fehlmann later described as [...] "an Orb track which became so long that it became a whole album!". Due to this aimlessness, FFWD lacked an artistic goal and disbanded after a single release. Soon after the release of FFWD in August 1994, Weston suddenly left the Orb. Paterson claimed that Weston's departure was due to his desire to have more control in the Orb. In an interview with i-D, Weston attributed the split to Paterson, saying that Paterson [...] "didn't do his 50 per cent of the work." [...] Paterson reaffirmed the status of the Orb saying, [...] "The Orb is the Orb, and nothing can change that", and continued work with Hughes and Fehlmann.|$|E
500|$|One of the Orb's {{most notable}} {{contributions}} to electronic music is {{their idea of}} blurring the distinction between sampling and remixing. Albums such as <b>Pomme</b> Fritz, though released {{as a piece of}} original work, consist largely of manipulated samples. Conversely, the Orb's remixes typically use only small sections of the original track, most notably in the case of their single [...] "Toxygene". [...] "Toxygene" [...] was originally commissioned as a remix of Jean Michel Jarre's [...] "Oxygene 8" [...] from Oxygene 7-13. The Orb [...] "obliterated it" [...] and reassembled only a few fragments for their remix, much to the chagrin of Jarre, who reportedly refused to release it; The Orb released the track themselves under the name [...] "Toxygene", which further irritated Jarre, to whom Paterson retorted [...] "The French are always five years behind us, anyway." [...] In statements made after the release of [...] "Toxygene", Jarre denied that he rejected the original remix because of disliking it.|$|E
2500|$|Pat's [...] "Digging for apples" [...] {{could be}} a cross-language pun, as <b>pomme</b> de terre (literally; [...] "apple of the earth") means potato and <b>pomme</b> means apple, which little English girls {{studying}} French would easily guess.|$|E

2500|$|In heraldry, a roundel is a {{circular}} charge. [...] Roundels {{are among the}} oldest charges used in coats of arms, dating from at least the twelfth century. Roundels in British heraldry have different names depending on their tincture. Thus, while a roundel may be blazoned by its tincture, e.g., a roundel vert (literally [...] "a roundel green"), it is more often described by a single word, in this case <b>pomme</b> (literally [...] "apple", from the French) or, from the same origins, pomeis—as in [...] "Vert; on a cross Or five pomeis".|$|E
2500|$|Since the 50th {{anniversary of}} Liberation in 1995, {{a pattern of}} {{official}} ceremonies has developed based in and around Liberation Square in Saint Helier where the events at the Harbour Master's Office and <b>Pomme</b> D'Or Hotel occurred in 1945. Following a special sitting of the States of Jersey in the morning, States Members, clergy, the Bailiff of Jersey, the Lieutenant-Governor, Jurats, Crown Officers and other officials process from the Royal Square to Liberation Square accompanied by the Royal Mace and the Bailiff's Seal. An open air ecumenical service takes place in Liberation Square followed by the singing of [...] "Man Bieau P'tit Jèrri"/"Beautiful Jersey" [...] (in Jèrriais and English) and a re-enactment of the raising of flags (including that at Fort Regent). A parade of vintage and military vehicles, bands and service organisations is reviewed by the official party.|$|E
2500|$|The Pomerol region, and its {{northern}} border, the Barbanne river was historically considered the frontier {{boundary between the}} north where people spoke the Langues d'oïl and the south where they spoke the Langue d'oc. Though {{it is difficult to}} pinpoint exactly when grapes were first planted in the Pomerol region there is enough evidence to show that viticulture was present in the area {{during the time of the}} Romans. Similarly there is uncertainty as to the origins of the name [...] "Pomerol", although there is some speculation that it stems from the Latin word poma which refers to a fruit bearing seeds and is the origin of the French word <b>pomme,</b> meaning apple. This theory is supported by the region's long history of polyculture with many other crops, particularly fruits and grains, being cultivated in the area long before viticulture became a primary focus.|$|E
