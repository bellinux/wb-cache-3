With reasonable frequency planning, {{the system can}} be used in multi-standard wireless communication applications(GSM, WCDMA, GPRS, TD-SCDMA, WLAN(802. 11 a/b/g)). The implementation is achieved by a 0. 13 μm RF CMOS process.

The {{state of the art}} of circuit development in this area is the use of a large amount of active and passive components to realize telecommunication systems. The development of methods to increase the integration complexity has been one major aspect of this work. Low noise amplifiers, mixers, oscillators and <b>prescalers</b> have been developed. To increase the integration complexity, the integration of planar inductors serving as matching elements and for the realization of LC-resonant circuits has been investigated. If a sufficient quality factor can be achieved planar inductors can replace several external components and lead to the monolithic integration of receivers and transmitters. The results show, that BiCMOS technologies can be used to realize successfully telecommunication systems in the frequency range of 1 GHz and in future far beyond this limit. The integrated inductors are without any variation of the technology (high ohmic areas, thicker metalization, thicker oxides) not suitable to replace external inductors, especially for use in oscillators.

40|$|The use of {{resonant}} CMOS frequency dividers {{with direct}} injection in frequencysynthesizers {{has increased in}} recent years due to their lower power consumptioncompared to conventional digital <b>prescalers.</b> The theoretical and experimentalaspects of these dividers have received great attention. This masters thesis workis a continuation of earlier work, based on the fundamentals of Injection-LockedFrequency Dividers (ILFD’s). The LC CMOS ILFD with direct injection is wellknownfor its divide-by- 2 capability. However, it does not divide well by oddnumbers. The goal of this master thesis work is to modify the LC CMOS ILFDwith direct injection {{so that it can}} divide equally well by odd and even integers. In this master thesis report, an introduction to the basic concepts behindInjection-Locked frequency dividers is first presented. Some of the previous workand the background of a reference LC CMOS ILFD design are studied. The author,studied the reference design, and the experimental setup used for characterizingit’s locking behavior. The algorithm used to characterize the locking behavior ofthis ILFD are explored to reproduce the results for divide-by-even numbers for theexisting ILFD topology. Using a Spice model these results are also reproduced insimulations. Over the years, numerous ILFD circuit topologies have been proposed, most ofwhich have been optimized for division by even numbers, especially divide-by- 2. It has been more difficult to realize division by odd numbers, such as divide-by- 3. This master thesis work develops a simple modification to an LC CMOS injectionlocked frequency divider (ILFD) with direct injection, which gives it a wide lockingrange both in the “divide-by-odd number” mode and in the conventional “divideby-even number” regime, thereby opening up applications which require frequencydivision by an odd number.

50|$|Prescalers are {{typically}} used {{at very high}} frequency to extend the upper frequency range of frequency counters, phase locked loop (PLL) synthesizers, and other counting circuits. When {{used in conjunction with}} a PLL, a <b>prescaler</b> introduces a normally undesired change in the relationship between the frequency step size and phase detector comparison frequency. For this reason, it is common to either restrict the integer to a low value, or use a dual-modulus <b>prescaler</b> in this application. A dual-modulus <b>prescaler</b> is one that has the ability to selectively divide the input frequency by one of two (normally consecutive) integers, such as 32 and 33. Common fixed-integer microwave prescalers are available in modulus 2, 4, 8, 5 and 10, and can operate at frequencies in excess of 10 GHz.|$|E
50|$|Today, most dual-modulus prescalers exist {{inside of}} PLL chips, making it {{impossible}} to probe actual signals during operation. The first dual-modulus prescalers were discrete ECL devices, separate from the PLL chips. Here {{is an example of a}} dual-modulus <b>prescaler</b> in use. This circuit happens to use a Motorola MC145158 with a Fujitsu MB-501 dual-modulus <b>prescaler</b> operating in the 128/129 mode. The PLL is locked at 917.94 MHz (fo) with a channel spacing frequency of 30 kHz (fr). The total integer count therefore is 30,598. Dividing this by 128 (M) yields a quotient of 239 with a remainder of 6, N and A respectively. The result of this frequency choice is that the <b>prescaler</b> spends most of its time counting at 128, and just a brief period at 129.|$|E

50|$|The AVR {{line can}} {{normally}} support clock speeds from 0 to 20 MHz, with some devices reaching 32 MHz. Lower-powered operation usually requires a reduced clock speed. All recent (Tiny, Mega, and Xmega, but not 90S) AVRs feature an on-chip oscillator, removing {{the need for}} external clocks or resonator circuitry. Some AVRs also have a system clock <b>prescaler</b> that can divide down the system clock by up to 1024. This <b>prescaler</b> can be reconfigured by software during run-time, allowing the clock speed to be optimized.|$|E
5000|$|A {{frequency}} divider, {{also called}} a clock divider or scaler or <b>prescaler,</b> is a circuit that takes an input signal of a frequency, , and generates an output signal of a frequency: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>prescaler</b> is to allow the timer to be clocked at the rate a user desires. For shorter (8 and 16-bit) timers, there will often be a {{tradeoff}} between resolution (high resolution requires a high clock rate) and range (high clock rates cause the timer to overflow more quickly). For example, one cannot (without some tricks) achieve 1 µs resolution and a 1 sec maximum period using a 16-bit timer. In this example using 1 µs resolution would limit the period to about 65ms maximum. However the <b>prescaler</b> allows tweaking the ratio between resolution and maximum period to achieve a desired effect.|$|E
50|$|So {{while we}} still have a factor of M being multiplied by N, we can add an {{additional}} count, A, which effectively gives us a divider with a fractional part. Only the <b>prescaler</b> needs to be constructed from high-speed parts, and the reference frequency can remain equal to the desired output frequency spacing.|$|E
50|$|The Butterfly's ATmega 169 CPU {{is capable}} of speeds up to 8 MHz, however it is factory set by {{software}} to 2 MHz to preserve the button battery life.

Alternatively, this may be accomplished by changing the CPU <b>prescaler</b> in the application code.|$|E
5000|$|Suppose {{that the}} {{programmable}} divider, using N, is {{only able to}} operate at a maximum clock frequency of 10 MHz, but the output fo is {{in the hundreds of}} MHz range; [...] Interposing a fixed <b>prescaler,</b> which can operate at this frequency range, with a value M of say, 40, drops the output frequency into the operating range of the programmable divider. However, a factor of 40 has been introduced into the equation, so the output frequency is now: ...|$|E
50|$|High {{clock rates}} impose {{additional}} design {{constraints on the}} counter: if the clock period is short, {{it is difficult to}} update the count. Binary counters, for example, need a fast carry architecture because they essentially add one to the previous counter value. A solution is using a hybrid counter architecture. A Johnson counter, for example, is a fast non-binary counter. It can be used to count very quickly the low order count; a more conventional binary counter can be used to accumulate the high order count. The fast counter is sometime called a <b>prescaler.</b>|$|E
50|$|Frequency {{counters}} {{designed for}} radio frequencies (RF) are also common and {{operate on the}} same principles as lower frequency counters. Often, they have more range before they overflow. For very high (microwave) frequencies, many designs use a high-speed <b>prescaler</b> to bring the signal frequency down {{to a point where}} normal digital circuitry can operate. The displays on such instruments take this into account so they still display the correct value. Microwave frequency counters can currently measure frequencies up to almost 56 GHz. Above these frequencies the signal to be measured is combined in a mixer with the signal from a local oscillator, producing a signal at the difference frequency, which is low enough to be measured directly.|$|E
