30|$|Also of {{interest}} are the insights provided here about marking materials, lacquer and soot-based ink. Lacquer was exploited much earlier in Chinese history than ink, for example for lacquer vessels, as an adhesive agent, for painting, {{and even for}} writing. Historical documents and archaeological evidence both indicate that ink was produced during the late Zhou Dynasty (1050 - 221 bc) to write on bamboo and wooden slips [33, 36, 37], such as the two fragmentary wooden slips found at Qingchuan [34]. In addition, a broken <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>soot</b> for ink-making, 2.1  cm in diameter and 1.2  cm in height, {{was found in the}} Qin tomb of Shuihudi in 1976 [4, 38], while the tomb of Marquis Yi (ca. 475 - 433 bc) of the Zeng State [35] yielded earlier bamboo slips with ink characters. Given the preliminary evidence presented here for soot-based ink marking evidence on the Qin bronze triggers, an important question remains how widespread such painted/inked marking is on the wider assemblage of crossbows from Pit 1 or {{in other parts of the}} rest of the mausoleum complex. There is a much greater likelihood that such inked marks will have faded or disappeared altogether from the trigger surface, and/or further vestiges can probably only be identified with close analytical prospection. We suggest a more comprehensive programme of study involving multispectral imaging and verification by SEM and Raman spectroscopy is worthwhile in future.|$|E

Methods: In the period from 2007. to 2011. the soot immission was followed at two sites: in Kosovska Mitrovica and Zvecan. The concentration <b>of</b> <b>soot</b> is determined by the reflectometric method. The statistical hypotheses were tested on statistical significance level of 0. 05.

Advances include the spectroscopy of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and optical diagnostics for PAHs in flames, new approaches to identify the structure and composition <b>of</b> incipient <b>soot,</b> and the latest refinements for soot particle detection and quantification. Improvements of selective and quantitative PAH measurements have been made possible with supersonic expansion of flame extracted samples, coupled with laser induced fluorescence (jet-cooled LIF) and mass-spectroscopy combined with resonance enhanced or synchrotron selective photoionisation.

In particular, optical exploration has led to new insight into soot inception, including the identification <b>of</b> particular <b>soot</b> precursors from large PAHs to nanoparticles passing through stacked PAHs, polymeric-like structures and aliphatic-linked PAHs. Despite the various improvements, the ultimate accuracy <b>of</b> the <b>soot</b> diagnostic methods such as laser induced incandescence, light extinction and elastic light scattering relies on our knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>soot</b> optical properties which may vary as a function <b>of</b> <b>soot</b> age in flames.
