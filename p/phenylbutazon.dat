The definitely unfavourable effect of indomethacin, <b>phenylbutazon,</b> etamsylate and H.

40|$|Necrotising {{fasciitis}} can be life threatening, requiring prompt {{diagnosis and}} surgical debridement. We report {{a case of}} necrotising fasciitis caused by an adulterate traditional Asian medication—Jamu Pegal Linu, containing toxic levels of phenylbutazone and dipyrone. The patient presented with severe neutropenia and sepsis. An urgent extensive debridement was carried out (within 6 hours of presentation). Repeated debridements were performed on days 2 and 5, augmented with antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{and efficacy}} of a cinchophen prednisolone combination preparation (PLT) were assessed in the dog. Cinchophen administered at a dose rate of 12 - 5 mg/kg intravenously had a volume of distribution (Vd area) of 0 ??? 13 litres/kg, a clearance rate (Cl) of 0 ??? 15 litres/h and a half-life (t 1 / 2 ?? of 7 ??? 92 hours. Following oral administration the bioavailability was 87 - 21 per cent. Prednisolone administered at a dose rate of 0 ??? 15 mg/kg intravenously had a Vd area of 2 ??? 7 litres/kg, a CI of 0 ??? 116 litres/h and a t 1 / 2 ?? of 1 ??? 11 hours. PLT given to dogs with osteoarthritis at a dosage range of between 25 and 44 mg/kg per day cinchophen and between 0 ??? 125 and 0 ??? 220 mg/kg per day prednisolone for a maximum of 14 days significantly improved lameness (P< 0 ??? 001), weight bearing (P< 0 ??? 005), joint mobility (P< 0 ??? 01) and stiffness (P< 0 ??? 001) scores and was similar in clinical efficacy to <b>phenylbutazon...</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The drug-plasma protein {{interaction}} {{is a fundamental}} issue in guessing and checking the serious drug side effects related with other drugs. The purpose {{of this research was}} to study the interaction of cephalexin with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and displacement reaction using site probes. Methods: The interaction mechanism concerning cephalexin (CPL) with BSA was investigated using various spectroscopic methods and molecular modeling method. The binding sites number, n, apparent binding constant, K, and thermodynamic parameters, ΔG 0, ΔH 0, and ΔS 0 were considered at different temperatures. To evaluate the experimental results, molecular docking modeling was calculated. Results: The distance, r= 1. 156 nm between BSA and CPL were found in accordance with the Forster theory of non-radiation energy transfer (FRET) indicating energy transfer occurs between BSA and CPL. According to the binding parameters and ΔG 0 = negative values and ΔS 0 = 28. 275 j mol- 1 K- 1, a static quenching process is effective in the CPL-BSA interaction spontaneously. ΔG 0 for the CPL-BSA complex obtained from the docking simulation is - 28. 99 kj mol- 1, which is close to experimental ΔG of binding, - 21. 349 kj mol- 1 that indicates a good agreement between the results of docking methods and experimental data. Conclusion: The outcomes of spectroscopic methods revealed that the conformation of BSA changed during drug-BSA interaction. The results of FRET propose that CPL quenches the fluorescence of BSA by static quenching and FRET. The displacement study showed that <b>phenylbutazon</b> and ketoprofen displaced CPL, indicating that its binding site on albumin is site I and Gentamicin cannot be displaced from the binding site of CPL. All results of molecular docking method agreed with the results of experimental data...|$|E
