Will nobody contrive a more expeditious mode of progress? The jog-trot movement, to my thinking, is {{little less than}} positive torture. Upon my word we have not made {{more than a hundred}} miles the hour since leaving home! The very birds beat us--at least some of them. I assure you that I do not exaggerate at all. Our motion, no doubt, seems slower than it actually is--this on account of our having no objects about us by which to estimate our velocity, and on account of our going with the wind. To be sure, whenever we meet a balloon we have a chance of perceiving our rate, and then, I admit, things do not appear so very bad. Accustomed as I am to this mode of travelling, I cannot get over a kind of giddiness whenever a balloon passes us in a current directly overhead. It always seems to me like an immense bird of prey about to pounce upon us and carry us off in its claws. One went over us this morning about sunrise, and so nearly overhead that its drag-rope actually brushed the network suspending our car, and caused us very serious apprehension. Our captain said that if the material of the bag had been the trumpery varnished [...] "silk" [...] of five hundred or a thousand years ago, we should inevitably have been damaged. This silk, as he explained it to me, was a fabric composed of the entrails of a species of earth-worm. The worm was carefully fed on mulberries--kind of fruit resembling a water-melon--and, when sufficiently fat, was crushed in a mill. The paste thus arising was called papyrus in its primary state, and went through a variety of processes until it finally became [...] "silk." [...] Singular to relate, it was once much admired as an article of female dress! Balloons were also very generally constructed from it. A better kind of material, it appears, was subsequently found in the down surrounding the seed-vessels of a plant vulgarly called euphorbium, and at that time botanically termed milk-weed. This latter kind of silk was designated as silk-buckingham, on account of its superior durability, and was usually prepared for use by being varnished with a solution of gum caoutchouc--a substance which in some respects must have resembled the gutta percha now in common use. This caoutchouc was occasionally called Indian rubber or rubber of twist, and was no doubt one of the numerous fungi. Never tell me again that I am not at heart an antiquarian.|$|E

50|$|This {{antihelix}} {{plastic surgery}} is {{performed with the}} incision-suture technique. A long incision is made {{on the back of}} the ear and a strip of skin is removed. The cartilage is completely cut through in several places. With thick cartilage, the back of the antihelix is made thinner by using a scalpel to remove cartilage. If the cavum conchae (hollow before the ear canal entrance) is large, it is made smaller by additionally removing a crescent-shaped piece of cartilage from the concha. Or a so-called conchal rotation is performed by first removing muscle and connective tissue from the sulcus posterior (region where the ear is attached to the head), and then the ear is turned towards the head with sutures running between the <b>pericranium</b> and the cartilage of the concha, thus reducing its distance to the head. Using several mattress sutures that are anchored in the cartilage, a new antihelix fold is formed, or a weakly developed antihelix fold is bent more strongly. After the insertion of a drainage tube for 1 or 2 days, the skin wound {{on the back of the}} ear is sutured. Occasionally the newly formed antihelix is additionally fixed with outer mattress sutures that are made over small swabs so that they don’t cut into the skin. Dressing is usually applied for 1 or 2 weeks.|$|E
50|$|The five {{layers of}} the scalp, from {{superficial}} to deep, can be easily memorized by using the mnemonic SCALP. The Skin of the scalp is the thickest of the human body, measuring up to 8 mm in thickness and contains approximately 100.000 hairs. Hair lines make scalp reconstruction difficult because the hair lines have to be respected to get a satisfying aesthetic result.The subCutis is a layer of fat, enclosed in compartments formed by rigid fibrous septa. Their inelasticy prevents bleeding vessels to collapse and retract under the skin to achieve haemostasis. All large blood vessels and nerves of the scalp are located in this layer.The next layer is the galea Aponeurotica, which separates the underlying bone and the overlying layers. The large blood vessels and nerves of the scalp don’t pierce this layer.Loose connective tissue between the periostium and the aponeurosis makes these two rigid structures easily slide over each other and contributes to skin movement. Thus, if vascular and nervous anatomy is respected, the skin, sucutaneous tissue and galea aponeurotica can be lifted off the skull with minimal bleeding, nerve damage, or chance of necrosis. This method was first described by Orticochea in 1967, but has been updated to minimize scarring.The fifth layer is the Periosteum of the skull, {{also referred to as}} <b>pericranium.</b> It can be separated from the skull, except near the sutures. The skull consists of an inner and outer table, with spongy bone in between known as diploë.|$|E

Five symptomatic patients with Chiari I malformation and one patient with syringomyelia-Chiari I complex were operated on with this technique. The indications to perform a duraplasty were accidental arachnoid breaching in three patients during an extra-arachnoidal approach and arachnoidal dissection due to intraoperative findings of arachnoid pathology in the remaining three patients. The overall morbidity of this technique was nil.

METHODS: Radiological markers {{were placed in the}} subcutis of Wistar rats undergoing subperiosteal detachment of the <b>pericranium</b> with pulling and fixation of the flap. We performed radiography on postoperative days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 45. A p-value of < 0. 05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis of the data indicated that the flaps in the surgical adhesive group remained in place with no change from the immediate postoperative position. However, the flaps in the suture anchored in the skull bone tunnel group and in the control group showed similar healing, with a loss of attachment of 9. 7 % and 22 %, respectively, compared with the immediate postoperative position. There was no quantitative difference between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: This experimental model created acceptable experimental conditions for testing different soft tissue fixation methods.
