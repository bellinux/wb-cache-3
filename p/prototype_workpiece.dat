40|$|Abstract. Oval {{bevel gear}} is {{introduced}} {{as a new}} gear transmission type of intersecting axes, in which high-order, denaturing and eccentric one are included. Based on the theory of spatial engagement, spatial spherical coordinate system of the noncircular bevel gearing was developed and a generalized tooth profile equation of noncircular bevel gears was also proposed. The gear profile can be enveloped for the generating movement between conical cutter and oval bevel gear according to the envelope principle of conjugate profiles. Then a new and general parametric design method for oval bevel gear was founded. The classification and gear variability condition of oval bevel gear were discussed. Meanwhile, its pitch curve, addendum and dedendum curve were studied, and the corresponding equations were deduced. A roll check experiment is performed on the <b>prototype</b> <b>workpiece.</b> Then the influences of motor speed and load on transmission ratio were analyzed. Finally, the design method, profile generation method and manufacture method of oval bevel gear were certified as correct by comparing experimental curve of transmission ratio with theoretical one...|$|E
40|$|In many {{of today}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{industrial}} robot applications, motions of the manipulator are planned using a <b>prototype</b> <b>workpiece</b> and played back for {{the execution of the}} actual manufacturing processes. This thesis addresses the problem of programming and controlling of industrial robots with the aim of responding to the demands for increased reliability and productivity with the desired quality and adaptability to environmental changes. The developed system has been applied to the assembly of automotive Body-In-White parts, namely, the hinge and fender. Robotic systems consist primarily of a manipulator and actuators that drive the manipulator links. Currently available robot controllers require exact knowledge of both robot and motor dynamics and acceleration feedback. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 presents a new approach that does not require exact knowledge of robot-actuator system. In chapter 4, This is achieved by adopting adaptive feedback linearization techniques. Enhancing those techniques, to be applied in an optimal sense by exploiting the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, minimizes the required control effort. The results demonstrate an asymptotic tracking response for the output; this is achieved using minimum control effort. By implementing an observer that guarantees asymptotic stability for the estimation errors, the acceleration feedback constraint is removed, which has a significant impact from a practical point of view since acceleration feedback is not available for most industrial controllers. Moreover, applying this technique removes linear growth constraints on the nonlinearities inherent in the system in order to guarantee global stability. Chapter 5 presents a different approach to the same problem by adopting a robust adaptive motion controller that requires only position measurements. The global stability of the proposed controller tracking performance is proved in the Lyapunov sense. In addition, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the asymptotic tracking performance of the closed-loop system. The significance of the above mentioned technique {{is that it does not}} require that a general expression and bound for the control input signal be found. In addition, it does not assume the availability of velocity measurements, which, for practical purposes may not be readily available. In Chapter 6, an adaptive controller ensuring zero force and tracking errors has been proposed. The stability of the proposed controller tracking performance is proven in the Lyapunov sense. The presented method establishes global as opposed to local convergence, in the presence of unmodelled dynamics. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

50|$|The term Dexel has {{two common}} uses:Dexel ("depth pixel") {{is a concept}} used for a discretized {{representation}} of functions defined on surfaces used in geometrical modeling and physical simulation, sometimes {{also referred to as}} multilevel Z-map. Dexel is a nodal value of a scalar or vector field on a meshed surface. Dexels are used in simulation of manufacturing processes (such as turning, milling or rapid <b>prototyping),</b> when <b>workpiece</b> surfaces are subject to modifications. It is practical to express the surface evolution by dexels especially when the surface evolution scale {{is very different from the}} structural finite element 3D model discretization step (e.g. in machining the depth of cut variation is often several orders of magnitude smaller (1-10 µm) than the FE model mesh step (1 mm)).|$|R

40|$|The method {{consists}} of a repeated sequence of the following steps: (a) application of a thin layer (13) consisting of a mould material, with cutouts (14) corresponding to the workpiece geometry, onto a carrier structure (18); and (b) filling of the cutouts with a castable workpiece material (16). The mould material is removed after a required number of repetitions of the above two steps. Alternatively thin layers of a workpiece material is applied onto a carrier structure. The layers are provided with contour lines and cutouts or grooves which subsequently are filled with a mould material. After a required number of repetitions of these steps the mould material is removed. USE - For production of <b>workpiece</b> <b>prototypes</b> consisting, in particular, of metals or ceramics.
