50|$|The wheel diameter(tread) reduces due {{to brake}} {{application}} as the brake blocks rub against the wheel tread. Over {{a period of}} time, the wheel diameter reduces up to 819 mm. 819mm is the condemnation diameter for the wheels. This diameter is also not sacrosanct and is changed depending upon the supply position of the wheels. The maximum variation in the wheels on the same axle is permitted up to 0.5 mm, between two wheels of the same bogie up to 5 mm and among the four wheel sets of the same coach up to 13 mm. The diameter of a new wheel is 915 mm. Hence maximum wheel tread wear allowed is (915 mm - 819mm) = 96 mm. In order to adjust for {{the difference in the}} wheel tread, a packing is placed under the flange of the lower spring seat. This <b>packing</b> <b>ring</b> is generally made up of NFTC(Natural Fiber Thermosetting COMPOSITE) or UHMWPE (Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene) material.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to try and understand hypercompressor <b>packing</b> <b>ring</b> failures better with a view of ultimately reducing or even eliminating their occurrences. In order to gain further understanding of <b>packing</b> <b>ring</b> failures, we seek to obtain an appreciation of the stresses they experience during operation. First we consider a conventional simulation of an axisymmetric <b>packing</b> <b>ring</b> and cup subjected to the typical pressure loading conditions experienced by these components when installed in a hypercompressor cylinder. The key locations of interest are along the bimaterial interface, and in particular at the ends of the interface. These ends effectively represent a butt joint in contact and a butt joint under pressure. To begin to gain an appreciation of the stresses at these locations, we undertake a finite element analysis (FEA) of the configuration with traditional interface and contact conditions. Unfortunately the traditional analysis does not produce stresses that appear to converge at either end as judged by simple convergence checks. As is indicated by previous research, a singularity is expected to occur at the butt joint under pressure, and thus diverging stresses. However, for the butt joint in contact the situation is les...|$|E
40|$|Turbomachinery sealing is a {{challenging}} problem {{due to the}} varying clearances caused by thermal transients, vibrations, bearing lift-off etc. Leakage reduction has significant benefits in improving engine efficiency and reducing emissions. Conven-tional labyrinth seals have to be assembled with large clearances to avoid rubbing during large rotor transients. This results in large leakage and lower efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel Progressive Clearance Labyrinth Seal {{that is capable of}} providing passive fluidic feedback forces that balance at a small tip-clearance. A modified <b>packing</b> <b>ring</b> is supported on flexures and employs progressively tighter teeth from the upstream to the downstream direction. When the tip-clearance reduces below the equilibrium clearance, fluidic feedback forces cause the <b>packing</b> <b>ring</b> to open. Conversely, when the tip-clearance increases above the equilibrium clearance, the fluidic feedback forces cause the <b>packing</b> <b>ring</b> to close. Due to this self-correcting behavior, the seal provides high differential pressure capability, low leakage and non-contact operation even in the presence of large rotor transients. Theoretical models for the feedback phenomenon have been developed and validated by experimental results.

40|$|The {{nonuniform}} abrasion {{failure and}} high-temperature thermal failure of packing rings {{have a significant}} influence on compressor reliability, particularly that of oil-free compressors. In this study, a test rig was constructed to measure the dynamic temperature of packing rings under different operational conditions in an oil-free reciprocating compressor. The dynamic axial and radial temperature distributions of the packing rings were obtained using an innovative internal temperature testing device that kept the thermocouples and packing box relatively static during compressor operation. A three-dimensional heat transfer model was also developed to analyze the temperature distribution of the packing boxes, piston rod, and cylinder during such operation. Good agreement was observed between the simulation results and experimental data, which showed an average relative error of less than 2. 35 %.
