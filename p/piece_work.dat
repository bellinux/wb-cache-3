[...] Longacre submitted two designs to Pettit, and before the latter died on May31, 1853, he selected one of the two; relief models quickly followed the approval. [...] Longacre's models, both for the obverse and reverse, did not have lettering on them, as the legends and numbers were to be punched once a reduction was made.

The <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> cross section is changed by the forming process asymmetrically and symmetrically to a <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> axis (3). The <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> cross section is changed in different radial levels, which are spaced apart from each other in direction of a <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> axis. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for partial forming of a <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> for interior high pressure form, comprises carrying out the forming process via a tool though which a discharge geometry of the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> is approximated in a sub region of a <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> cross section of the interior high pressure form to create <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> geometries. The <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> cross section is changed by the forming process asymmetrically and symmetrically to a <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> axis (3). The <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> cross section is changed in different radial levels, which are spaced apart from each other in direction of a <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> axis. The tool has a pressing roll (5) with a surface section (4) and the pressing roll is subjected with a force in such a manner that the surface section with the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> is brought into unit to transform the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> in a partially transforming step. The pressing roll and the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> are moved relatively to each other. The surface section of the pressing roll has multi regions of different geometry, by which a definite region is brought into the unit with the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> by swiveling the pressing roll around a swivel axis (8). The tool has multi pressing rolls, which are aligned in radial direction around the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> to change the <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> cross section. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for: (1) a device for partial forming of a <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> for interior high pressure form; and (2) an interior high pressure- formed <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> produced from semi-finished product. USE - Useful for partial forming of a tubular <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> for interior high pressure form (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The method increases the cost-efficiency of the forming of a <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> and ensures high flexibility and high quality of the partially formed <b>work</b> <b>piece</b> for interior high pressure form...|$|R

In December 1874, Blavatsky met the Georgian Mikheil Betaneli. Infatuated with her, he repeatedly requested that they marry, to which she ultimately relented; this constituted bigamy, as her first husband was still alive.
