Differential thermal analysis studies were conducted on whole buds and isolated primordia in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> nucleation. The results showed {{that some of the}} water in isolated primordia remained supercooled in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> nucleation. Although most tissue water froze (57. 5 %) following ice nucleation at − 2. 5 °C, a considerable amount of water was found to supercool. In the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> nucleation, increased hydration of isolated primordia resulted in the elimination of the supercooling characteristic. The structural integrity of isolated primordia appeared to be essential for supercooling...|$|R

25|$|On 7 October 2009, the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> water <b>ice</b> was {{confirmed}} {{on the surface}} of 24 Themis using NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility. The surface of the asteroid appears completely covered in ice. As this ice layer is sublimated, it may be getting replenished by a reservoir <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> under the surface. Organic compounds were also detected on the surface. Scientists hypothesize that some of the first water brought to Earth was delivered by asteroid impacts after the collision that produced the Moon.

50|$|A radar can {{be useful}} in {{detecting}} ice, but the returning signal which bounces <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> (even <b>icebergs)</b> is very faint, much lower than from ships. Conventional marine radars are designed for target detection and avoidance. Enhanced marine radars provide a higher definition image <b>of</b> the <b>ice</b> that the vessel is transmitting and will result in a much clearer image. This image can be used to identify the quantity and sort <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> that has to be dealt with. In standard radar, sea clutter affects the ability to see in the near vicinity of the vessel.

40|$|Although {{scientific}} evidence {{prior to that}} from ODP Leg 119 indicates the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> an <b>ice</b> sheet on East Antarctica by at least the earliest Oligocene, {{the question as to}} the size and stability <b>of</b> that initial <b>ice</b> sheet is still contested. Current hypotheses include (1) the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a small <b>ice</b> sheet in the earliest Oligocene with stepwise growth during the Neogene, (2) the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a continental-sized <b>ice</b> sheet in the late middle Eocene with no major evidence of subsequent deglaciation, and (3) the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> glacial <b>ice</b> in the earliest Oligocene with a major ice sheet during the mid-Oligocene, followed by growth and decay <b>of</b> several <b>ice</b> sheets with characteristics similar to the temperate <b>ice</b> sheets <b>of</b> the Pleistocene of North America but with changes over a longer time scale (millions of years vs. 100, 000 yr).

40|$|This paper makes a {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} thermophysical properties <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> slurry with conventional single-phase secondary fluids used in thermal storage cooling systems. The ice slurry is a two-phase fluid consisting of water, antifreeze and ice crystals. It is a new technology that has shown great energy potential. In addition to transporting energy as a heat transfer fluid, it has thermal storage properties due to the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice,</b> storing coolness by latent heat of fusion. The single-phase fluids analyzed are water-NaCl and water-propylene glycol solutions, which also operate as carrier fluids in <b>ice</b> slurry. The <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> changes the thermophysical properties of aqueous solutions {{and a number of}} these properties were determined: density, thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity. Data were obtained by software simulation. The results show that the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> 10 % by weight <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> provides a significant increase in thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity, without causing changes in density. The rheological behavior <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> slurries, associated with its high viscosity, requires higher pumping power; however, this was not significant because higher thermal conductivity allows a lower mass flow rate without the use of larger pumps. Thus, the ice slurry ensures its high potential as a secondary fluid in thermal storage cooling systems, proving to be more efficient than single-phase secondary fluids...|$|R

40|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of permafrost and the surface modification due to frost effects and the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> on Mars dates from early observations. Later analysis of the Viking Orbiter imagery produced evidence suggesting the former <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> sheets that could have played a part in shaping the surface of Mars. Similarities were pointed out between a number of streamlined Martian channel features and similar streamlined landforms created by Antarctic ice sheet movement. A study of Viking Orbiter imagery of Granicus Valles and the surrounding terrain in Elysium has produced further evidence of glaciation on Mars. Volcanism has {{played an important role in}} developing the landscapes of the Elysium region. A possible explanation is that subsidence occurred during formation of the Martian moberg ridges due to the melting <b>of</b> ground <b>ice</b> near the eruption area while at a distance most <b>of</b> the ground <b>ice</b> in the permafrost is still present and the original elevation was preserved. Meltwater during and following eruptions might be suddenly released during subglacial volcanism into Granicus Valles in one case and into Hrad Valles in the other.

40|$|Changes in the {{formation}} of dense water in the Arctic Ocean and Nordic Seas [the "Arctic Mediterranean" (AM) ] probably contributed to the altered climate of the last glacial period. We examined past changes in AM circulation by reconstructing radiocarbon ventilation ages of the deep Nordic Seas over the past 30, 000 years. Our results show that the glacial deep AM was extremely poorly ventilated (ventilation ages of up to 10, 000 years). Subsequent episodic overflow of aged water into the mid-depth North Atlantic occurred during deglaciation. Proxy data also suggest that the deep glacial AM was ∼ 2 ° to 3 °C warmer than modern temperatures; deglacial mixing of the deep AM with the upper ocean thus potentially contributed to the melting <b>of</b> sea <b>ice,</b> <b>icebergs,</b> and terminal ice-sheet margins...|$|R
