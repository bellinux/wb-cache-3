The unique nature of the Stolypin agrarian reform in Russia provides a natural experiment with exogenous variation in liquidity constraints.

Some communes were not affected by the reform, permitting difference-in-differences analysis.

40|$|The {{first part}} of the thesis studies the impact of {{liquidity}} crashes on asset prices. In financial markets, liquidity could have large downward jumps. The thesis proposes a dynamic model where investors face the risk of <b>potential</b> <b>liquidity</b> crises. We find that investors choose optimal portfolios not only to hedge the risk of asset fundamentals, but also to hedge the risk of <b>potential</b> <b>liquidity</b> crashes. The potentially illiquid assets tend to have a lower price, a higher volatility, and a lower volume turn-over. Liquidity hedging could induce high return premium and asset returns could have excess volatility over the fundamentals. The risk of <b>potential</b> <b>liquidity</b> crises will also generate rich patterns in return dynamics and the expected asset returns could be driven by risks that are not systematic. The second part of the thesis analyzes the effect of illiquidity on the extreme risk of hedge funds. Hedge funds' returns often exhibit positive autocorrelations, which suggests illiquidity in their asset holdings. In this part, using a data set containing monthly returns of over 5, 600 hedge funds, I study how illiquidity affects the extreme risk of hedge funds. I use MA(q) processes to model hedge funds' returns and use smoothing coefficients as proxies for liquidity. The tail risks are estimated using the extreme value theory and the generalized Pareto distribution. We find that illiquidity in general has a negative impact on the tail risk of hedge funds' returns. In particular, the true Value-at-Risk (VaR) of hedge funds could be much higher when illiquidity is taken into consideration. (cont.) The third part of the thesis studies asset pricing under heterogeneous information. In an asset market where agents have heterogeneous information, asset prices not only depend their expectations of the true fundamentals but also depend on their expectations of the expectations of others. Iterations of such expectations lead to the so-called "infinite regress" problem, which makes the analysis of asset pricing under heterogeneous information challenging. In this part, we solve the infinite-regress problem in a simple economic setting under a fairly general information structure. This allows us to examine how different forms of information heterogeneity impacts the behavior of asset prices, their return dynamics, trading volume as well as agents' welfare. by Weiyang Qiu.

A survey research design and documentary analysis were used. Based on the results, commercial banks had problems in sourcing funds. Sources of funds were mainly transitory deposits with little coming from treasury activities, interbank activities and offshore lines of credit. There was no lender {{of the last}} resort function by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. Some banks struggled to raise the minimum capital requirements. After the dollarisation of the economy, progressively commercial banks took up the lending activity. Locally owned banks were aggressive while foreign owned banks took a passive stance. The banks that were aggressive in lending had problems of non-performing loans especially from the corporate clients, which exposed the banks to liquidity risk. The other <b>potential</b> source of <b>liquidity</b> risk emanated from liquidity risk management by the commercial banks. As much as all commercial banks had comprehensive policies and procedure manuals, some banks were not adhering to them. In addition some banks violated set risk limits.

Indeed, fluctuations in various measures of liquidity are significantly correlated across common stocks(Chordia, Roll and Subrahmanyam (2000)).

We interpret the Fed's early-stage liquidity programs as working to dampen balance sheet amplifications arising from the positive feedback between financial constraints and asset prices. By comparison, the Fed's later-stage crisis programs take into account adverse-selection amplifications that operate via increases in credit risk and the externality imposed by risky borrowers on safe ones.
