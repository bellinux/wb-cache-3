40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} {{is to examine the}} {{formation}} of a separate risk management committee (RMC) and its effect on the modified audit report among the non-banking and financial companies listed in Bursa Malaysia. Data was collected from the annual reports of a sample of 300 companies from 2004 until 2009. Both descriptive and multivariate analyses were employed to address the research objectives. The results indicate that a separate RMC is negatively related with the acceptance of the modified audit report. Further, the RMC’s members with independent non-executive status and members with accounting and financial background will also probably reduce the acceptance of the modified audit report. However, losses recorded for <b>previous</b> <b>financial</b> <b>years</b> are likely to increase the issuance of modified audit report by the auditor. The period of auditor engagement with the client and client size will also affect the modified audit report. The findings provide empirical evidence on the development and importance of a separate RMC for the modified audit report...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{provides a}} summary of current crime trends in Victoria. PreambleVictoria Police Crime Statistics Official Release is prepared for release each year by Corporate Statistics, and includes statistical summaries of offences recorded by police in Victoria for the previous financial year. This release contains crime statistics for the 2012 / 13 financial year, and includes data from recent financial years for basic trend analysis. The purpose of this document is to provide {{a summary of}} current crime trends, and not to comment on Victoria Police performance, or to assess or evaluate Victoria Police operational strategies. Statistics included in this publication were compiled from data stored on the Law Enforcement Assistance Program (LEAP) and extracted on 18 July 2013. LEAP is a dynamic database designed primarily for operational policing purposes. Victoria Police update existing records with new information as it becomes available, and revise records when investigation identifies additional information. The Central Data Entry Bureau of Victoria Police also amends records when quality control checks identify inaccurate or incomplete information. Due to the dynamic nature of LEAP, statistics produced at different times from the same data may vary. Because of this, statistics produced in this publication for <b>previous</b> <b>financial</b> <b>years</b> will differ slightly from those previously published. Recorded crime consists of those offences recorded on LEAP during the reporting period, regardless of when the offence occurred or when it was reported to police. Information contained in this publication relates only to those crimes reported to or detected by Victoria Police. The method of recording crime clearances has been changed since 2011 / 12 (see Appendix 2). All figures are rounded to one decimal place. Because of this, percentage point differences in clearance rates may appear different than when calculated from the rounded figures in the tables and graphs. Care should be taken in interpreting large percentage changes where actual counts are small, as these changes may not be statistically significant. Detailed crime classification rules and definitions are included in Appendix 1 to provide assistance in the interpretation of statistics. As the information presented in this document is by no means exhaustive, any requests for additional information should be directed to the Chief Statistician, Corporate Statistics...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate challenges affecting the effective implementation of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No. 1 of 1999 as amended by Act No. 29 of 1999) in the Eastern Cape Province with specific reference to the Provincial Department of Public Works. The research study has been conducted in such a manner that the reason to send a team of experts by the DPSA on approval by the President to come to the Eastern Cape and assist the ailing administrations of four departments is determined. The four departments that had a problem were: 1. Department of Roads and Public Works 2. Department of Health 3. Department of Education and 4. Department of Social Development The roads function of the Department of Roads and Public Works was later transferred to the Department of Transport and the Department of Roads and Public Works changed the name to Department of Public Works in September 2004. The team that was sent to the Eastern Cape together with the Director-General of the Province and the Superintendent-General of the Provincial Treasury formed up the IMT. The objective was to introduce turnaround strategies that would enable the four departments to effectively and efficiently implement the PFMA to the best interest of the South African Government. The PFMA is part of the broader strategy on improving public financial management in the public sector in the Republic of South Africa. It prescribes measures to ensure responsibility, accountability and transparency in national and provincial departments. Qualified Auditor-General’s reports for the <b>previous</b> <b>financial</b> <b>years</b> compelled the President in 2002 to establish Interim Management Team (IMT) in the Eastern Cape, comprising of experts from national government, to assist the ailing administration in four provincial departments, including the Department of Roads and Public Works. Questionnaires to employees, Auditor-General, Provincial Director-General, Superintendent-General of Provincial Treasury and as well as to the Accounting Officer of the Department of Public Works, were designed and issued out for completion. Interviews were also conducted to some of the employees. The assumption is that the majority of employees do not understand policies and procedures of the department and they displayed this by remaining neutral in questions asked and disagreed with some of the statements. During the interview process, the majority emphasised their protest against over usage of consultants by the department. Preference given to candidates from outside the department when senior posts are advertised instead of looking for excellently performing candidates from the internal ranks of serving employees, has been outlined as one of the elements contributing to low moral and low productivity in the workplace. Over usage of consultants and a big number of employees who disagreed with statements and remained neutral signify incapacity of the management to perfectly implement the PFMA for sound public financial management in the department. It has been established that regular risk assessments are not conducted, poor organisational structure with many posts that are not filled, no Anti-Corruption Unit to implement Public Service Anti-Corruption Strategy and, no clear managerial lines of accountability due to poor planning, ineffective internal controls and procedures, all render the department incapable of becoming one of the best provincial departments that get unqualified audit report from the Auditor-General. The findings provide clear indication that drastic transformation of the department into an institution that can perfectly implement the PFMA is necessary. The implication is that mismanagement of financial resources and fraud and corruption defeat service delivery objectives. Strategic objectives of the department are not achieved. The Eastern Cape Provincial Departments are obliged to align their strategic plans to the Provincial Growth and Development Plan (2004 – 2014). Therefore the implication is that, poor performance by the Department of Public Works impacts negatively to this provincial objective. Lack of effective control systems has negative implications on the administration of the department and renders it vulnerable to fraud and corruption...|$|E
