50|$|Climbing/falling film <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> designs can be group into single-effect and multiple-effect film plate designs.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic design}} of the climbing/falling film <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> {{consists}} of two phases. In the climbing phase, the liquid feed is heated by a flow of steam as it rises through a corrugated plate. In the subsequent falling phase, the liquid flows downward at high velocity under gravitational force. Evaporation and cooling occurs rapidly in the falling phase.|$|E
5000|$|Climbing/falling film <b>plate</b> <b>evaporators</b> {{are used}} {{in a range of}} applications: ...|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} <b>plate</b> <b>evaporators</b> {{have been used}} {{for a wide range of}} {{applications}} such as fruit juice evaporation, desalination aboard ships, refrigerants and smaller industrial applications. None of these types of <b>plate</b> <b>evaporators</b> is suitable for larger industrial evaporation duties. The background for the development of and experience with such a large industrial evaporator is given...|$|R
50|$|The liquid {{entering}} the circulation evaporator will boil in the separator, {{not on a}} heating surface, hence minimising fouling, whereas with <b>plate</b> <b>evaporators,</b> boiling will occur on a heating surface. It {{is for this reason}} that circulation evaporators are preferred for liquids with a higher tendency to foul. Minimal fouling also means that the cleaning cycles are not as frequent as with other <b>evaporators</b> such as <b>plate</b> <b>evaporators.</b>|$|R
50|$|A climbing/falling film <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> is a {{specialized}} type of evaporator {{in which a}} thin film of liquid is passed over a rising and falling plate to allow the evaporation process to occur. It {{is an extension of}} the falling film evaporator, and has application in any field where the liquid to be evaporated cannot withstand extended exposure to high temperatures, such as the concentration of fruit juices.|$|E
50|$|Minimizing {{residence}} time {{is important in}} order to minimize the occurrence of chemical reactions between the feed and the evaporator materials, thus reducing fouling within the evaporator. This guideline is especially important in the food processing industry, where purity of output product is paramount. In this application, {{residence time}} bears directly on product quality, thus {{it is important for the}} climbing and falling film <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> to have low residence time.|$|E
50|$|In {{designing}} a film <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator,</b> {{the use of}} superheated liquid needs to be controlled {{in order to prevent}} nucleate boiling. Nucleate boiling will cause product deterioration resulting from increases in chemical reaction rates that come from the raise in temperature. Nucleate boiling will cause fouling to occur, thus affecting the rate of heat transfer of the process. In order to avoid nucleate boiling, the liquid superheat should be in the range of 3 to 40 K depending on the liquid used.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{problems}} related to climbing and falling film <b>plate</b> <b>evaporators.</b> One {{of them is the}} energy intensive system. In order to improve the productivity of the plant, the energy consumption needs to be reduced with the intention of reducing the use of steam. New strategies had been proposed by investigator to reduce the utilization of steam to improve the system of economic steam. The examples of operating strategies are flashing of feed, product and condensate, splitting of feed and steam and use of optimum feed flow series.|$|R
40|$|Research on the direct-expansion solar-assisted {{heat pump}} (DX-SAHP) system with bare <b>plate</b> <b>evaporators</b> for space heating is {{meaningful}} but insufficient. In this paper, experiments on a DX-SAHP system applying bare <b>plate</b> <b>evaporators</b> for space heating are {{conducted in the}} enthalpy difference lab with a solar simulator, with the ambient conditions stable. The independent effects of ambient temperature, solar irradiation, and relative humidity on the system performance are investigated. When ambient temperature changes as 5 °C, 10 °C, and 15 °C, COP increases as 2. 12, 2. 18, and 2. 26. When solar irradiance changes as 0 [*]W m− 2, 100 [*]W m− 2, 200 [*]W m− 2, 300 [*]W m− 2, and 500 [*]W m− 2, COP of the system changes as 2. 07, 2. 09, 2. 14, 2. 26, and 2. 36. With ambient temperature of 5 °C and solar irradiance of 0 [*]W m− 2, when relative humidity is 50 %, no frost formed. Whereas with relative humidity of 70 % and 90 %, frost formed but not seriously frosted after 120 [*]min of operating. Frost did not deteriorate but improved the heating performance of the DX-SAHP system. The change of relative humidity from 70 % to 90 % improves the evaporating heat exchange rate by 35. 0 % and increases COP by 16. 3 %, from 1. 78 to 2. 07...|$|R
40|$|General {{trend of}} free trade in {{regional}} level {{as well as in}} the direction of European Union has motivated sugar factories located in Serbia to invest into technologies that are more efficient in order to make their products more competitive at the markets in Europe. The aim of this work was to evaluate effects of falling film <b>plate</b> <b>evaporators</b> on the energy consumption of evaporation plant, as well as to validate performance of this type of evaporators. It was found that this type of evaporator decreased energy requirements and in the same time evaporation process was more effective due to high values of heat transfer coefficients. ...|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of climbing/falling film <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> is its short residence time. Since the liquid feed does not {{remain in the}} evaporator for long, this evaporator is suitable for heat/temperature sensitive material. Thus, this evaporator is used widely in food, beverages and pharmaceutical industries. Besides that, the colour, texture, nutritional content and taste of the liquid feed can be preserved too. Despite its functionality, this evaporator has a few drawbacks such as large energy consumption. Future development compromises installing large number of steam effects and recycle the steam where possible for better energy efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Work by Viviane Renaudin {{has led to}} the {{development}} of a new type of multiple-effect <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator,</b> which can be used for the desalination of brackish or sea water. The proposed distillation process is based on the principle of multiple-effect dripping film plate evaporators. The innovation lies in the horizontal transfer of vapour to the condensation zone. From a socio-economic point of view, thanks to its human-scale dimensions, its modular construction and its ease of assembly, the system has the advantage of being usable by unskilled operators in developing countries. The process also has political value: it enables countries to end their dependence on their neighbours for their drinking water supplies.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{evaporator}} {{is mainly}} used in processes dealing with heat-sensitive materials, the residence {{time should be}} kept as low as possible. Residence time is the time taken for the product to be in contact with heat. To improve the product quality, short heat contact period from single pass operation can minimize product deterioration. The climbing and falling film <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> is capable of satisfying this requirement. Short residence time {{can be achieved by}} higher liquid flow rates down the tube in the falling film evaporator. The effect of gravitational force will increase the flow rate of the liquid resulting in the short residence time.|$|E
40|$|A chiller is {{a device}} which cools a fluid by {{removing}} heat from it, either through a vapour – compression or absorption refrigeration cycle; {{with the key}} components being the compressor, condenser, evaporator and expansion device [...] This paper emphasizes on studying the design procedure followed in the industries and performance evaluation of two different configruatons of 5 ton based chilling plant. The two such configurations studied are scroll compressor and <b>plate</b> heat <b>evaporator</b> and scroll compressor and {{shell and tube evaporator}} with R 404 A refrigerant. the results on basis of this experiment shows that the configruation scroll compressor and <b>plate</b> heat <b>evaporator</b> can give better results as compared to the configruation scroll compressor and shell and tube evaporator...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of two <b>evaporators</b> (round tube <b>plate</b> fin and microchannel) and {{their effect on}} system performances were experimentally investigated in R 410 a residential air conditioning systems. Both systems share identical components except evaporators and system performance were measured under AHRI A, B and C conditions. Under all test conditions, the system with the microchannel evaporator outperformed the baseline system with the round tube <b>plate</b> fin <b>evaporator.</b> Up to 10. 6 % increase of capacity and 13. 1 % increase of COP were achieved if both systems were operated under the same compressor speed. Up to 23. 8 % improvement of COP was obtained if the cooling capacities of both systems were kept the same. The refrigerant charge was reduced by 13. 4 % compared with the baseline system, due to the smaller internal volume of the microchannel evaporator. The air side heat transfer area of microchannel evaporator was just Â½ of the baseline round tube <b>plate</b> fin <b>evaporator,</b> {{and so was the}} face area...|$|R
50|$|This alloy {{exhibits}} good {{fatigue strength}} and has relatively high thermal conductivity. It {{is used for}} seawater condensers, condenser <b>plates,</b> distiller tubes, <b>evaporator</b> and heat exchanger tubes, and saltwater piping.|$|R
5000|$|The heat {{transfer}} {{performance of the}} climbing and falling film <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> is affected by several factors, including {{the height of the}} feed inside the tube and the temperature difference. The height of the feed water is inversely related to the climbing film height. The low height of feed water will lead to the high height of climbing film. Higher height of the climbing film will increase the percentage of saturated flow boiling region therefore it will lead to an increase in the local {{heat transfer}} coefficient. The optimum height ratio of feed water is found to be [...] Any height ratio less than 0.3 will cause the local heat transfer coefficient to decrease. Besides that, small liquid content in the tube can minimize the foaming problem.|$|E
50|$|Climbing and falling-film plate {{evaporators}} have {{a relatively}} large surface area. The plates are usually corrugated and are supported by frame. During evaporation, steam flows through the channels formed by the free spaces between the plates. The steam alternately climbs and falls parallel to the concentrated liquid. The steam follows a co-current, counter-current path {{in relation to the}} liquid. The concentrate and the vapor are both fed into the separation stage where the vapor is sent to a condenser. This type of <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> is frequently applied in the dairy and fermentation industries since they have spatial flexibility. A negative point of this type of evaporator is that it is limited in its ability to treat viscous or solid-containing products. There are other types of plate evaporators, which work with only climbing film.|$|E
50|$|Evaporation {{of liquid}} film in film {{evaporators}} {{is very important}} in order to cool the flowing liquid and the surface on which the liquid flows. It can also increase the concentration of the components in the liquid. The climbing/falling film <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> is specifically designed to produce a thin film during both the climbing and falling phases. For the climbing film evaporators, the feed is introduced {{at the bottom of the}} tubes. Evaporation causes the vapor to expand thus causing a thin film of liquid to rise along the tubes. The vapor shear will push the thin film to climb up the wall of the tubes. The feed for the falling film evaporator on the other hand is introduced at the top of the tubes. The liquid flows down the tubes and it will get evaporated as it descends. The flow of the liquid down the tubes is driven by the vapor shear stress and the gravitational forces. The effect of the vapor shear and the gravity will lead to a higher flow rates and shorter residence time. The flow of the thin liquid film in the falling film evaporator is possible in two ways: cocurrent and countercurrent. It is cocurrent if the vapor is drawn from the top to the bottom of the tubes and vice versa for the countercurrent flow. The cocurrent flow will increase the flow rates resulting in a shorter residence time. The type of flow can be described in figure 2.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the investigation of refrigerant flow boiling heat transfer in multi-microchannel copper cold <b>plate</b> <b>evaporators.</b> A comprehensive review of recent studies related to saturated flow boiling in minichannels and microchannels is first presented. The review {{focuses on the}} functional dependence of heat transfer characteristics on thermodynamic vapor quality. Results from recent investigations in the literature are compiled and analyzed. Correlations for flow boiling are quantitatively assessed by comparing them against independent data sets from the published literature. ^ Flow boiling heat transfer data for the refrigerants R- 134 a and R- 245 fa in multi-microchannel copper cold <b>plate</b> <b>evaporators</b> are obtained using a carefully designed and fabricated experimental setup. The first test section contains 17 channels with hydraulic diameters of 1. 09 mm. The second test section contains 33 channels with 0. 54 mm hydraulic diameter. The heat transfer coefficient is measured locally for a thermodynamic vapor quality range from - 0. 2 to 0. 9 (negative quality indicates subcooled inlet conditions), a saturation temperature range from 8 to 30 °C, a mass flux range from 20 to 350 kg m- 2 s- 1 and heat fluxes ranging from 0 to 22 W cm- 2. Measurement results were repeatable and showed low measurement uncertainty. The heat transfer coefficient is found to vary significantly with heat flux and vapor quality, but only slightly with saturation pressure and mass flux for the range of values investigated. ^ Finally, a composite correlation including nucleate boiling and convective heat transfer terms is developed. The values predicted by the correlation are compared to a database of 3899 measured heat transfer coefficients from 14 studies covering 12 different wetting and non-wetting fluids {{and a range of}} hydraulic diameters from 0. 16 to 2. 92 mm. The database encompasses mass fluxes from 20 to 3000 kg m- 2 s- 1, heat fluxes from 0. 4 to 115 W cm- 2, vapor qualities from 0 to 1, and saturation temperatures from - 194 to 97 °C. The correlation is able to predict the measured heat transfer coefficients with a mean absolute error of 28 % even though several measured data sets show opposing trends to the predictions with respect to some operating parameters. ...|$|R
40|$|Flow boiling heat {{transfer}} with the refrigerants R- 134 a and R- 245 fa in copper microchannel cold <b>plate</b> <b>evaporators</b> is investigated. Arrays of microchannels of hydraulic diameter 1. 09 and 0. 54 mm are consid- ered. The aspect ratio of the rectangular {{cross section of the}} channels in both test sections is 2. 5. The {{heat transfer}} coefficient is measured as a function of local thermodynamic vapor quality in the range À 0. 2 to 0. 9, at saturation temperatures ranging from 8 to 30 °C, mass flux from 20 to 350 kg mÀ 2 sÀ 1, and heat flux from 0 to 22 W cmÀ 2. The heat transfer coefficient is found to vary significantly with heat flux and vapor quality, but only slightly with saturation pressure and mass flux for the range of values investi- gated. It was found that nucleate boiling dominates the heat transfer. In addition to discussing measure- ment results, several flow {{boiling heat transfer}} correlations are also assessed for applicability to the present experiments...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{will examine}} {{the development of a}} thermal control system (TCS) for future space missions utilizing a single active cooling loop. The system architecture enables the TCS to be reconfigured during the various mission phases to respond, not only to varying heat load, but to heat rejection temperature as well. The system will consist of an accumulator, pump, cold <b>plates</b> (<b>evaporators),</b> condenser radiator, and compressor, in addition to control, bypass and throttling valves. For cold environments, the heat will be rejected by radiation, during which the compressor will be bypassed, reducing the system to a simple pumped loop that, depending on heat load, can operate in either a single-phase liquid mode or two-phase mode. For warmer environments, the pump will be bypassed, enabling the TCS to operate as a heat pump. This presentation will focus on recent findings concerning two-phase flow regimes, pressure drop, and heat transfer coefficient trends in the cabin and avionics micro-channel heat exchangers when using the heat pump mode. Also discussed will be practical implications of using micro-channel evaporators for the heat pump...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOwning to {{the high}} heat {{transfer}} coefficient and relatively small heat transfer areas, <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> is now becoming more dominant in the desalination market. However, literatures on <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> performance for seawater desalination are rather limited. Physical and mathematics model for <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> with corrugated plate was developed for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. Two-phase flow and heat transfer characteristics in the channel of <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> were analyzed in detail. The effects of different geometric parameters of corrugated plate inclination angle on seawater evaporating performance were revealed and discussed. In order to verify the simulation results, the experimental correlation for flow performance characteristics of <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> was employed to {{compare with that of}} CFD results. The results may benefit the design of plate evaporators for multi effect distillation seawater desalination...|$|E
40|$|Compact <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> designs offer {{high rates}} of heat transfer, {{with a number of}} {{advantages}} which have been well researched in the beet industry. However, such designs are not well established in the cane sugar industry, mainly because of the fears of {{high rates of}} fouling and consequent blockages. During the 1996 - 97 season, a Balcke Durr falling film <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> pilotplantwasinstalled at theGledhow sugarfactory. Tests were carried out with the objectives of assessing the performance of the unit under factory conditions, and identifying potential problems of operating such a unit in the cane sugar industry.

Although the season was short some heat transfer measurements were possible, and these gave encouraging results. Aspects of fouling and cleaning, including scale analysis, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The local {{two-phase}} {{heat transfer}} coefficient is a critical parameter {{in the design of}} microchannel cold <b>plate</b> <b>evaporators</b> used in applications such as electronics cooling systems. Only a few past studies on microchannels have investigated the heat transfer characteristics over the entire vapor quality range and conflicting trends have been reported even in these studies. Therefore, the present study focuses on the investigation of the local flow boiling {{heat transfer coefficient}} at different vapor qualities of the refrigerant R- 134 a. An experimental setup was built to measure the local heat transfer coefficient and to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} underlying physics. Two evaporators were considered in this study. They employ parallel microchannels with 1. 09 and 0. 54 mm hydraulic diameter and an aspect ratio of 2. 5. Measurements were conducted at saturation temperatures ranging from 9 to 29 °C, mass fluxes from 20 to 300 kg m- 2 s- 1 and wall heat fluxes of up to 20 W cm- 2. A comparison between measurements and established correlations from the literature is presented...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} an experimental investigation of refrigerant liquid mass fraction (LMF) in the exit flows of <b>plate</b> <b>evaporators.</b> The {{objective is to}} identify a sensor {{that is capable of}} measuring small amounts of refrigerant liquid in the superheated vapor at evaporator exits. This sensor should have the potential to be combined with an active control scheme that increases the fill factor of the evaporator while simultaneously reducing superheat temperature at the evaporator exit. Four methods were used to detect refrigerant droplets in the superheated vapor stream exiting a plate evaporator: (1) an energy balance calculation, (2) a microfabricated thin-film resistance sensor developed specifically for this project, (3) an exposed beaded thermocouple, and (4) photodiodes that detected laser light scattered by droplets. The design, fabrication, calibration procedures, and theory of operation of the MEMS thin-film resistance sensor are also presented in this report. Experimental results indicate that a MEMS thin-film resistance sensor is more sensitive than a beaded thermocouple to LMF of non-equilibrium evaporator exit flows. The MEMS sensor accurately detected refrigerant LMF as low as 1. 5 % in superheated evaporator exit flows...|$|R

40|$|A pilot <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> plant {{using the}} new AlfaVap 700, {{together}} with a controller test rig, was installed at Malelane Sugar Mill. The <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> was first installed in parallel to the first effect then the second and fourth effects. Measurements were taken to determine the heat transfer coefficients. It {{was found that the}} values measured in the second effect exceeded those for Roberts vessels operating under similar conditions, while results for the first and fourth effects compared favourably with design values for Roberts vessels. Although provision was made for chemical cleaning, this was never found to be necessary. For completeness of the study, a chemical clean was performed after the fourth effect test was completed. In the study it was found that heat transfer coefficients comparable to or better than those achievable with a shell and tube design can be expected using plate heat exchangers. None of the fouling problems previously experienced with plate evaporators were detected while testing the new AlfaVap 700 pilot plant...|$|E
40|$|Tests {{intended}} {{to determine the}} variation of some parameters, mainly refrigerant mass flow and velocity, on the low side of the A/C system during start up conditions were performed in a ' 94 Caravan. The tests were designed to capture the rapid changes in conditions at the evaporator outlet during air conditioning system start up. In particular {{we were interested in}} finding the range of refrigerant flow rates under transient operation to determine conditions at the <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> that might produce acoustic resonance...|$|E
40|$|An ammonia loop {{heat pipe}} (LHP) {{with a flat}} <b>plate</b> <b>evaporator</b> is {{developed}} and tested. The device uses a nickel wick encased in an aluminum-stainless steel casing. The loop is tested for various heat loads and different sink temperatures, and it demonstrated reliable startup characteristics. Results with {{the analysis of the}} experimental observation indicate that the conductance between the compensation chamber and the heater plate can significantly influence the operating temperatures of the LHP. A mathematical model is also presented which is validated against the experimental observations...|$|E
5000|$|... "Frost-Free" [...] refrigerator/freezer units usually use {{a heating}} element to defrost their evaporators, a pan to collect and {{evaporate}} water from the frost that melts from the cold <b>plate</b> and/or <b>evaporator</b> coil, a timer which turns off the compressor and turns on the defrost element usually from once to 4 times a day for periods usually ranging from 15 to 30 minutes, a defrost limiter thermostat that turns off the heating element before the temperature rises too much while the timer {{is still in its}} defrost phase. Some models also feature a drain heater to prevent ice from blocking the drain.|$|R
50|$|<b>Plate</b> Forced Circulation <b>Evaporators</b> utilize a {{centrifugal}} pump which forces liquid to circulate through the plate structures and heat exchanger. The flexibility of this design {{is a major}} advantage, as {{the rate of evaporation}} can be manipulated by either adding or removing extra plates, allowing it to perform a wide range of duties that require greater heat transfer co-efficient. More specifically, products with higher viscosity have been better suited to this design, with the <b>plate</b> forced circulation <b>evaporator</b> demonstrating higher performance and improved evaporation with comparison to the tubular forced circulation system. The liquid must undergo superheated temperature, which exceeds the original boiling point of the liquid by a large degree, forcing rapid evaporation. In addition, to flexibility, this system is compact, only needing small space and is easy to clean and maintain as plates are readily accessible. With regards to suitability, this design is currently being used in processes that involve liquids with low to medium evaporation rates and consist of minute portions of undissolved solutes with close to no capacity to induce fouling.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{explored the}} effects of fractionation and distribution of R- 407 c in brazed <b>plate</b> <b>evaporators</b> with an emphasis at low mass flux. Experiments were performed in parallel with R- 22. A parametric study was performed with nominal and reduced mass fluxes, with and without distributor and with various orientations of the evaporator. Also, operating conditions were varied to investigate the effect of refrigerant inlet quality and superheat at the exit of the evaporator. This investigation took an evaporator {{as part of a}} system approach rather than evaluating local heat transfer. All experiments show that R- 407 c is a viable replacement for R- 22. Overall heat transfer coefficients for R- 407 c were essentially equal to that of R- 22 when operating at nominal conditions. U-values for R- 407 c at low mass flux were up to 15 % less than R- 22. However, R- 407 c U-values were approximately 10 % greater than R- 22 when operating with a saturated refrigerant outlet condition. Contrary to expectations, only slight fractionation was seen for all test conditions and evaporator configurations. It was concluded that lower inlet quality slightly increases refrigerant composition shift. Also seen in this investigation was greater composition shift at greater mass flux for individual experiments. This condition could be related to significant oil hold-up seen at low mass flux. A distributor was developed in this investigation to allow better distribution when operating with refrigerant flow in the downward direction. While downward flow did not have an effect on refrigerant composition shift in this investigation, this orientation may be useful for other applications where more severe fractionation is seen. Other issues addressed were superheat instability and oil hold-up in the evaporator. Liquid droplets were seen at the exit of the evaporator when operating with low superheat. Also, it was found that up to 35 % of the volume of the evaporator could be filled with oil even when operating at nominal capacity...|$|R
