25|$|Many {{long-term}} {{problems with}} hip replacements {{are the result}} of osteolysis. This is the loss of bone caused by the body's reaction to polyethylene wear debris, fine bits of plastic that come off the cup liner over time. An inflammatory process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around the implants. In an attempt to eliminate the generation of wear particles, ceramic bearing surfaces are being used in the hope that they will have less wear and less osteolysis with better long-term results. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty) were also developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication. At the same time that these two bearing surfaces were being developed, highly cross linked polyethylene <b>plastic</b> <b>liners</b> were also developed. The greater cross linking significantly reduces the amount of plastic wear debris given off over time. The newer ceramic and metal prostheses do not always have the long-term track record of established metal on poly bearings. Ceramic pieces can break leading to catastrophic failure. This occurs in about 2% of the implants placed. They may also cause an audible, high pitched squeaking noise with activity. Metal-on-metal arthroplasty releases metal debris into the body raising concerns about the potential dangers of these accumulating over time. Highly cross linked polyethylene is not as strong as regular polyethylene. These <b>plastic</b> <b>liners</b> can crack or break free of the metal shell that holds them.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project was to develop an innovative manufacturing method that allows reinforcing fibres to be on-line impregnated with thermoplastics during wrapping and laid on a liner. The new process {{is based on the}} principle of in-situ extrusion of molten polymer on to a conventional fibre strand, which was not impregnated with the polymer, just before the fibres are laid on the liner. The project is divided into three units consisting of eight work steps in total to produce a demonstration component {{in the form of a}} fully-wrapped plastic cylinder for service pressures up to 300 bar (burst pressure greater than 900 bar). The concept of on-line impregnation with thermoplastics has been successfully realised using a partially reinforced steel liner. Based on a number of full-scale tests carried out, the good bursting behaviour, fatigue strength and ageing resistance of the component have been demonstrated. A <b>plastic</b> <b>liner</b> has been developed, which is produced by the rotational moulding process and into which the metallic end pieces (openings) are introduced during the moulding process. The <b>plastic</b> <b>liner</b> has been shown to be compatible with and to have a low permeability for the gases such as air and natural gas to be contained in it at high pressure. The <b>plastic</b> <b>liner</b> reinforced with fibres by the wet winding method has attained a burst pressure of 1050 bar on average. Compared to a conventional steel cylinder, its weight is reduced by about 70 %. The new winding technique could not be satisfactorily adopted with the <b>plastic</b> <b>liner.</b> It is therefore necessary to try out other thermoplastics or to develop new process steps in order to achieve sufficient temperature stability during winding.

50|$|Dielectric unions, with {{dielectric}} insulation, separate dissimilar metals (such as {{copper and}} galvanized steel) to prevent galvanic corrosion.

When the metals are {{in direct contact with}} each other, the electric current {{from one to the other}} also moves metallic ions from one to the other; this dissolves one metal, depositing it on the other.

5000|$|The {{practical}} drawbacks {{are more}} numerous. First, since some hard-sided waterbeds are {{of different sizes}} than other mattresses, bed sheets are harder to find and come in fewer varieties. Soft-sided mattresses are conventionally sized to avoid this problem. Second, moving a waterbed is a more difficult process than moving a normal bed; the water must be drained and the frame disassembled, then the frame must be reassembled, the mattress refilled with water, and the water heated for a potentially long period to get the new water to the correct temperature. And heating the bed can be costly: a waterbed consumes between 300 and 1500 kW·h/year, depending on the climate, bed size, and other factors. The energy usage can be decreased by about 60% {{with the use of}} a soft-sided waterbed. The water itself can pose challenges: occasionally, water mattresses may leak. <b>Plastic</b> <b>liners</b> will reduce damage, but emptying, patching, refilling, and reheating it (and sleeping elsewhere until all this is completed) is an inconvenience.|$|E
5000|$|After a six-stage zinc {{phosphate}} rustproofing process and two minutes submerged in a [...] electrophoretic painting vat (Fisher Body Division’s [...] "Elpo" [...] electrophoretic deposition of polymers process) to prime and further {{protect them from}} rust, assembled bodies were dried, wet-sanded, sealer-coated, sprayed with acrylic lacquer and baked in a [...] degree oven. Fisher's rustproofing was faulty. Failure to penetrate a gap between front fenders and cowl allowed moist debris and salt to rust the untreated steel, and trapped air prevented coating inside {{the tops of the}} front fenders, which on early Vegas had no protective liners.

50|$|With lined tubing, {{the thin}} inside liner {{is made of}} a {{chemically}} resistant material such as poly-olefin and PTFE that form a barrier {{for the rest of}} the tubing wall from coming in contact with the pumped fluid. These liners are materials that are often not elastomeric, therefore the entire tube wall cannot be made with this material for peristaltic pump applications. This tubing provides adequate chemical compatibility and life to be used in chemically challenging applications. There are a few things to keep in mind when using these tubes - any pin holes in the liner during manufacturing could render the tubing vulnerable to chemical attack. In the case of stiff <b>plastic</b> <b>liners</b> like the polyolefins, with repeated flexing in the peristaltic pump they can develop cracks, rendering the bulk material again vulnerable to chemical attack. A common issue with all lined tubing is delamination of the liner with repeated flexing that signals the end of the tube's life. For those with need for chemically compatible tubing, these lined tubing offer a good solution.|$|E

25|$|If the {{economic}} and geological conditions are right, the mining company will level large areas of land with a small gradient, layering it with thick plastic (usually HDPE or LLDPE), sometimes with clay, silt or sand beneath the <b>plastic</b> <b>liner.</b> The extracted ore will typically be run through a crusher and placed in heaps atop the plastic. The leaching agent will then be sprayed on the ore for 30–90 days. As the leaching agent filters through the heap the uranium will break its bonds with the oxide rock and enter the solution. The solution will then filter along the gradient into collecting pools which will then be pumped to on-site plants for further processing. Only some of the uranium (commonly about 70%) is actually extracted.|$|R
