50|$|Marco Breuer (born 1966, in Landshut) is a German {{photographer}} {{known for}} his radical approach to the medium. Much of his work is undertaken {{without the aid of}} a camera, aperture, or film, being instead produced through a combination of photogrammic, abrasive, and incisive techniques. Throughout his twenty-year career, Breuer has examined fundamental questions of photographic form and practice. Breuer works in and outside of the darkroom, exposing photographic material to heat, light, and physical abrasion. Drawing implements have included 12-gauge shotguns, the guts of electric frying pans, modified turntables, razor blades, and <b>power</b> <b>sanders.</b>|$|R
50|$|In boat {{building}} lots of sanding requires {{using either}} dry sandpaper, or {{wet and dry}} paper, to achieve a reasonable paint or varnish finish. Sandpaper is graded from 40 (very coarse) to 400 (ultrafine). Wet and dry sandpaper lasts longer than dry sandpaper. Wet and dry is best used on paint finishes, while dry paper is best used on dry wood. About 2 sheets of sandpaper for every foot of hull length is a good guide. Less sheet sandpaper is needed if <b>power</b> <b>sanders</b> are used. Spatula applicators, with a flexible stainless steel blade, are used to apply filler. A knife type and a flat 3"(75mm) type will cover most needs.|$|R
50|$|Founded by the American {{inventor}} Albert J. Dremel in 1932, {{the company}} is located in Racine, Wisconsin. Albert J. Dremel held 55 patents across {{a wide range of}} inventions, including the electric eraser, electric fish scaler, electric shoe polisher, electric screwdriver, <b>power</b> <b>sanders,</b> scroll saws, a device to keep tabs on chicken's egg production and first design of the now standard walk behind rotary lawn mower. His first product released within the company was with an electric razor blade sharpener. This success was soon brought to a halt after popularity of cheap, disposable razors came into effect. This then forced Albert J. Dremel to come up with his next invention, seen as the most important of his career - the high speed rotary tool, later named the Dremel Multitool. Compact, lightweight and versatile, this invention was successful in the hobby and craft market.|$|R

50|$|In {{the final}} evaluation, Ruth's main {{critique}} in the episode {{is that her}} plaster job was horrible (which would require many hours of sanding with a <b>power</b> <b>sander</b> and many coats of plaster to fix) {{and that she had}} used too much mortar to tile, while Candace's main critique was that she did not keep her workplace clean. The hammer falls hard on Jeff, though, as the experts thought that he made the largest amount of mistakes.|$|E

5000|$|In autumn, 2013, Stephen Hannock {{became the}} first American artist to be signed by Marlborough Fine Art, London, since Richard Diebenkorn 40 years before. [...] The painter was {{featured}} in a solo exhibition there--Stephen Hannock: Moving Water, Fleeting Light--which opened on February 4, 2014 and ran through March 1. Jason Rosenfeld, Ph.D., Distinguished Chair and Professor of Art History at Marymount Manhattan College, New York, curated the show of thirteen paintings and wrote in the accompanying catalogue: “Hannock’s approach involves an intricate layering of glazes of subtly modulated acrylic or oil across the prepared surfaces, repeatedly honing down the paint using <b>power</b> <b>sanders,</b> veneering the final sanded pigment layer with sheets of reflective resin, and then polishing that down to a matte sheen. This allows light to penetrate deeply into the strata of the picture plane and reemerge with an exceptional radiance." ...|$|R

40|$|A talented performer, Jamesie’s {{contributions}} to the history and devel-opment of the music now called quelbe are {{well known in the}} Caribbean, particularly by people in the Leeward Islands. Shot mainly in St. Croix USVI, Denmark and the continental United States, Leland’s film is organized into three acts. The first touches on Jamesie’s life, Crucian culture and quelbe’s historical background, the second follows Jamesie on trips to Denmark and mainland United States, and the third docu-ments his return to St. Croix from overseas. The film begins in St. Croix with Jamesie building a sardine-pan banjo-ukulele from scratch. Viewers are drawn in by the sound of him working—a hand held <b>power</b> <b>sander</b> and a machete chopping up a comb for parts are in remarkable balance with insects chirping in the back-ground. This acoustic space envelops the viewer until finally, Jamesie-as-narrator proclaims, “No man could afford to buy instruments.

50|$|Traditional carvel methods leave a small {{gap between}} each plank {{that in the past}} was filled with any {{suitable}} soft, flexible, fibrous material, sometimes combined with a thick binding substance. This caulking would gradually wear out and the hull would leak. Likewise, when the boat was beached for a length of time, the planks would dry and shrink, so when first refloated, the hull would leak badly unless recaulked — a very time-consuming and physically demanding job. The modern variation is to use much narrower planks that are edge-glued instead of caulked. With modern <b>power</b> <b>sanders</b> a much smoother hull is produced, as all the small ridges between the planks can be removed. This method started to become more common in the 1960s with the more widespread availability of waterproof glues, such as resorcinol (red glue) and then epoxy resin. Modern waterproof glues, especially epoxy resin, have caused revolutionary changes in both carvel and clinker style construction. Whereas in traditional construction it was the nails that provided the fastening strength, now it is the glue. It has become quite common since the 1980s for both carvel and clinker construction to rely almost completely on glue for fastening. Many small boats, especially light plywood skiffs, are built without any mechanical fasteners such as nails and lag screws at all, as the glue is far stronger.|$|R
50|$|Random orbit <b>sanders</b> are {{hand-held}} <b>power</b> {{tools for}} sanding {{in which the}} sanding blade delivers a random-orbit action. That is, the angle of rotation {{of the head and}} disk is variable. Perhaps the first introduced in 1976 by Festool but in 1982, random orbit sanders combine the speed and aggressiveness (again by Festool, Festo in 1982) of a belt sander with the ability to produce a finer finish than that available from a standard, slow speed orbital finishing sander. Random orbital sanders generally come in three different types: electric powered, air powered, and orbital floor sanders. The electric and air <b>powered</b> orbital <b>sanders</b> are handheld, while the floor orbital sanders are large machines that roll.|$|R

50|$|While early mass {{production}} of guitars dramatically {{increased the number}} of guitars in circulation, each instrument was still handcrafted by a single or team of luthiers. For luthiers who still choose to handcraft their instruments, methods have changed very little over the past 500 years. As more advanced tooling options become available, however, less of the work in manufacturing a guitar is necessary to complete by hand. Handcrafting guitars is a time and labor-intensive method of production. Some common tools used by luthiers today are a Band saw, Drill Press, Table Saw, Stationary Sander, Jointer, C Clamps, Sanding Board, Column <b>Sander,</b> <b>Power</b> Planer, Dovetail Saw, Scraper blades, Hand Files, Router, and Sand Paper.|$|R
50|$|Victor resumes {{chasing the}} Sheriff, Andrew and Dougherty and corners {{them in the}} water {{ambulance}} with Randy's corpse. They barricade themselves in and the Sheriff calls for the National Guard on the ambulance's radio, telling them they're being attacked by crazed gunmen. The National Guard tells them they'll be there in ten minutes. Just as they settle down and think everything's safe, Victor begins to saw {{his way through the}} boat wall with the gas <b>powered</b> belt <b>sander.</b> The Sheriff tells them not to move, if they try to leave, they'll get killed, while Andrew thinks they should leave while he's busy cutting through the wall. Amanda, Deputy Winslow and Marybeth arrive at the Swamp outside the burned down Crowley house. Amanda calls out for Victor, telling him they have his father. Upon hearing his ex-wife's voice, Sheriff Fowler attempts to leave, only to be grabbed by Victor and beheaded with the belt sander; his arms then move around in the air before collapsing. Andrew and Dougherty are trapped in the boat with Victor {{on the other side of}} the broken door. Dougherty attempts to slowly get the Sheriff's gun, but Victor grabs and pulls her through the hole on the door, which disembowels her. Andrew smartly remains in the boat, keeping himself out of sight of Victor.|$|R
40|$|Occupational {{exposures}} to wood dust {{have been associated}} with an elevated risk of sinonasal cancer (SNC). Wood dust is recognized as a human carcinogen but the specific cancer causative agent remains unknown. One possible explanation is a co-exposure to; wood dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs could be generated during incomplete combustion of wood due to heat created by use of power tools. To determine if PAHs are generated from wood during common wood working operations, PAH concentrations in wood dust samples collected in an experimental chamber operated under controlled conditions were analyzed. In addition, personal air samples from workers exposed to wood dust (n = 30) were collected. Wood dust was generated using three different <b>power</b> tools: vibrating <b>sander,</b> belt sander, and saw; and six wood materials: fir, Medium Density Fiberboard (MDF), beech, mahogany, oak and wood melamine. Monitoring of wood workers was carried out by means of personal sampler device during wood working operations. We measured 21 PAH concentrations in wood dust samples by capillary gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Total PAH concentrations in wood dust varied greatly (0. 24 - 7. 95 ppm) with the lowest being in MDF dust and the highest in wood melamine dust. Personal PAH exposures were between 37. 5 - 119. 8 ng m(- 3) during wood working operations. Our results suggest that PAH exposures are present during woodworking operations and hence could {{play a role in the}} mechanism of cancer induction related to wood dust exposure...|$|R
