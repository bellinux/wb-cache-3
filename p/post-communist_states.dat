40|$|This paper {{examines}} the, {{effect of}} communist regimes on <b>post-communist</b> <b>state</b> weakness through a detailed {{case study of}} the Roma-nian political system. The central claim is that the totalitarian, Neo-Stalinist communist Romanian regime {{was responsible for the}} <b>post-communist</b> <b>state</b> weakness. Through such measures as cadre rotation, the "blending " of state and Party structures, and planning, the Romani-an state apparatus was transformed into a servile conveyor belt for Ni-colae Ceau~escu's orders and ensured the hollowing-out of the state. This proved a major factor during the post-communist transformation, paving the way to post-communist patronage networks linking politi-cians, enterprise managers, and the state...|$|R

5000|$|The next {{important}} {{chapter in}} the history of shock therapy was the collapse of communism in Europe in 1989.

50|$|According to Eurostat, in 2011, 17.1% of EU {{population}} {{lived in}} overcrowded households by the above definition, {{with the number}} varying strongly between countries: the overcrowding rate stood at 43.1% in 12 newest member states compared to only 10.1% in 15 oldest members. Within the EU <b>post-communist</b> <b>states,</b> {{the extent to which}} the commodification of housing has improved occupancy standards appeared to be modest. For instance, during 2005-2010 the percentage of overcrowded population in Romania and Latvia remained the highest in the EU (55%). Conversely, the Czech Republic showed the best performance in 2010, with overcrowding falling from 33% to 22% over the period, becoming lower than in Italy and Greece. In the remaining EU <b>post-communist</b> <b>states,</b> overcrowding fell moderately over the period, accounting for 35-49% in 2010. Lifecycle has remained a powerful determinant of overcrowding. Eastern Europeans aged under 18 are on average 2.5 times more likely to experience overcrowding than those aged over 65. Affordability problems of young adults, who had to delay home leaving, contributed to unrelenting overcrowding, but so did the legacy of a housing stock composed of many small dwellings. In the EU <b>post-communist</b> <b>states,</b> between 51-87% of dwellings had no more than three rooms.|$|E

40|$|This article explores a key {{question}} in political sociology: Can post-communist policy-making be described with classical theories of the Western state or do we need a theory of the specificity of the <b>post-communist</b> <b>state?</b> In so doing, we consider Janine Wedel's clique theory, concerned with informal social actors and processes in post-communist transition. We conducted {{a case study of}} drug reimbursement policy in Poland, using 109 stakeholder interviews, official documents and media coverage. Drawing on 'sensitizing concepts' from Wedel's theory, especially the notion of 'deniability', we developed an explanation of why Poland's reimbursement policy combined suboptimal outcomes, procedural irregularities with limited accountability of key stakeholders. We argue that deniability was created through four main mechanisms: (1) blurred boundaries between different types of state authority allowing for the dispersion of blame for controversial policy decisions; (2) bridging different sectors by 'institutional nomads', who often escaped existing conflicts of interest regulations; (3) institutional nomads' 'flexible' methods of influence premised on managing roles and representations; and (4) coordination of resources and influence by elite cliques monopolizing exclusive policy expertise. Overall, the greatest power over drug reimbursement was often associated with lowest accountability. We suggest, therefore, that the clique theory can be generalized from its home domain of explanation in foreign aid and privatizations to more technologically advanced policies in Poland and other post-communist countries. This conclusion is not identical, however, with arguing the uniqueness of the <b>post-communist</b> <b>state.</b> Rather, we show potential for using Wedel's account to analyse policy-making in Western democracies and indicate scope for its possible integration with the classical theories of the state...|$|R
40|$|This study {{considers}} whether EU {{cohesion policy}} and related pre-accession instruments {{have contributed to}} the development of a more compound polity in Romania and, specifically, considers the extent to which there is a process of Europeanization characterized by emergent features of multi-level governance. In particular, it brings forward a number of explanatory factors which account for the process of regions’ creation in a centralized unitary <b>post-communist</b> <b>state</b> such as Romania. It shows that the regional reforms and regionalization have occurred in a very functional way and mostly as a means of accessing and managing regionallevel structural funds. It concludes by illustrating the emergence of new patterns of multi-level governance in the context of socialization and engagement with the EU’s cohesion policy. status: publishe...|$|R

It {{is a problem}} facing post-communist countries as they transition to democracies and market economies, as well as established democracies and other regimes. While the causes of corruption are varied, the tools often suggested to combat corruption include expanded use of whistleblowing in terms of incentives to encourage it and laws to protect whistleblowers. This article examines the role of whistleblowing {{as a tool to}} combat corruption.

50|$|The most {{important}} type of nearly neoclassical shock {{is due to}} market failure and imperfect markets.

40|$|While {{there is}} much {{research}} on the developmental trajectories of <b>post-Communist</b> <b>state</b> institutions and the external and domestic influences that have shaped their paths, much less is known about institutional performance, that is, {{the manner in which}} institutions operate {{and the extent to which}} they produce predictable patterns of effects. Academic analysis has been reluctant to shift attention from institutionalisation to effects, not least because of the fluidity of many formal institutions. The present article documents that over the last decade state institutions in East Central Europe have increasingly stabilized, especially at the macro-institutional level. The analysis highlights insights from institutional theory - notably how degrees, time, preferences and resources matter - to encourage further research in the field.

40|$|Abstract: The chief {{function}} of the modern Chinese press has been enlightenment and propaganda, not provision of information. This paper traces and compares the three prevailing models of Chinese journalism [...] Confucianism, Maoism, and Communist capitalism—with reference to press role, conception of journalists and audience, as well as source of media legitimacy. The Maoist model shares the Confucian emphases of elite (cadre) responsibility while fighting against elitism {{in the name of}} the “masses. ” The post-Mao media in what Deng Xiaoping called “socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics ” are, in effect, the media in “Communist (and <b>post-Communist)</b> <b>state</b> capitalism with authoritarian characteristics. ” Despite their seemingly irreconcilable differences, all three models conceive of the press as an instrument of China’s century-old quest for national wealth and strength. They see the press as a means, not as an end. Their implications (barriers) to Chinese democracy are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Economic trends {{associated}} with post-communism include denationalization, hyperinflation, liberalization, neoliberalism, and privatization. A fundamental challenge in post-communist economies is that institutional pressures {{that reflect the}} logic of capitalism and democracy are exerted on organizations (including firms and government agencies) that were created under communism and are, to this day, run by managers socialized in that context, resulting in {{a great deal of}} continuing tension in organizations in <b>post-communist</b> <b>states.</b>|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the process of EU enlargement and its impact upon ethnopolitics in contemporary Estonia. After discussing {{the construction of the}} <b>post-communist</b> <b>state</b> order within the context of emerging CSCE and CoE norms on minority rights, the author looks at how Estonia was able to reconcile its so-called ‘ethnic democracy’ with the EU Copenhagen criteria requiring the ‘respect for and protection of minorities’. The author draws attention to the subsequent shift away from ‘nationalizing statehood’ in Estonia towards a new strategy of ‘multicultural integration’ (where ‘multicultural democracy’ is portrayed as the ideal end-point of the integrative processes currently underway). In conclusion, the author discusses some of the ambiguities surrounding the concept of ‘multicultural integration’. Whilst deemed consistent with EU norms, it is argued that the meaning of this term remains vague and contested within an Estonian context. As a consequence, its relationship to existing Western models – and its applicability to post-Soviet Estonia – is still not entirely clear...|$|R

The <b>post-communist</b> <b>state</b> interferes {{more than other}} governments into social structure and supports strong actors. This hinders expansion of the main actor of a successful transition - the middle class. Its stagnation or adverse development causes that the social structure (disintegrated, polarized and unstable) implicitly becomes the main social problem itself which generates other "minor" problems. The middle-class perspective frames many tensions and there can be exhibited four of them: between pensioners and economically active; between working and non-working poor; between {{the middle class and}} other groups and between the entrepreneurial and white-collar middle class. Social cohesion cannot be reached by redistribution only. Redistribution must remain within restricted limits in order not to hinder social change by distorting individual motivation and personal effort. The delineation of such limits should also involve consideration of the social structure. transition, social structure, social policy, Czech Republic...|$|R
