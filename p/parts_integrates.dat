40|$|Some {{naturally}} occurring strains of fungi cease growing through successive subculturing, i. e., they senesce. In Neurospora, senescing strains usually contain intramitochondrial linear or circular plasmids. An entire plasmid or its <b>part(s)</b> <b>integrates</b> into the mtDNA, causing insertional mutagenesis. The functionally defective mitochondria replicate {{faster than the}} wild-type mitochondria and spread through interconnected hyphal cells. Senescence could also be due to spontaneous lethal nuclear gene mutations arising in the multinucleated mycelium. However, their phenotypic effects remain masked until the nuclei segregate into a homokaryotic spore, and the spore germinates to form a mycelium that is incapable of extended culturing. Ultimately {{the growth of a}} fungal colony ceases due to dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation. Results with senescing nuclear mutants or growth-impaired cytoplasmic mutants suggest that mtDNA is inherently unstable, requiring protection by as yet unidentified nuclear-gene-encoded factors for normal functioning. Interestingly, these results are in accord with the endosymbiotic theory of origin of eukaryotic cells...|$|E
