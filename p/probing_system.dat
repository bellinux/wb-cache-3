Quantitative {{dimensional}} metrologies of Nano/microstructures {{are increasingly}} demanded following the rapid developments in, for instance, semiconductor and precision engineering industry, microsystem technology and materials science.

A CMM is an instrument of direct measurement which function is to measure physical geometrical characteristics of an object.

In order to integrate a developed micro <b>probing</b> <b>system</b> in the CMM, a wireless electronic evaluation system has been developed. This electronic system is based on FPGA and digitalizes the analog signal using an Analog Digital Converter, sending wirelessly the values from the micro probe to the machine. Therefore, it allows the interfacing of the micro <b>probing</b> <b>system</b> without cables. In addition to this, the electronic system can be controlled and monitored through the computer. The developed system is able to send the values (selected by sending a command through the computer) from the micro probe to the machine and also to the PC, achieving a frequency of 1 kilohertz.

40|$|The {{continued}} {{trends of}} product miniaturisation and increased part complexity {{have led to}} a requirement for highly accurate coordinate metrology, suitable for small parts. Coordinate metrology of such parts is performed on a micro-coordinate measurement machine (micro-CMMs), for which a specialised micro-scale <b>probing</b> <b>system</b> is required. These probing systems consist of a probe onto which a stylus is mounted. The probe provides significant flexibility allowing the stylus tip to be easily deflected during contact with a surface. Achieving an optimum stiffness for the probe represents a significant design challenge, and often leads to undesirable compromises. For example, as stylus tip size reduces the contact pressure for a given load increases, requiring the probe stiffness to be kept as low as possible to prevent damage to the part surface; however, for a more robust <b>probing</b> <b>system</b> the stiffness should be increased. This thesis presents an improved tactile micro-probing system that makes use of an active suspension structure that can be tuned to have either low or high stiffness as required for each phase of a measurement. Development of the probe includes analytical and numerical modelling for a range of solutions as well as empirical investigations into the manufacture of a smart suspension structure for a prototype <b>probing</b> <b>system.</b> Modelling results demonstrate significant stiffness reduction is possible by using the concept of adjusting the internal strain of suspension beam elements. In principle stiffness may be reduced down to zero at the point of beam buckling. It is also shown that such a <b>probing</b> <b>system</b> can provide isotropic stiffness for a range of different styli lengths. A prototype of the suspension structure was fabricated using a chemical etching process and 6. 6 mm long stylus. The stiffness of the structure was assessed by measuring the modal frequencies of the suspension structure that correspond to vertical and lateral probe motion. Using this method, results show it is possible to reduce the frequency of the vertical mode and the torsional mode by 70...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDimensional {{measurement}} of work piece {{in between the}} manufacturing process is an essential method to achieve the precision components. The machine tool <b>probing</b> <b>system</b> can measure machined features of work piece placed on the machine table after partial or final machining operation. The in-process machine tool <b>probing</b> <b>system</b> is helpful in minimising the lead time of component by eliminating the unloading time on the machine and loading and inspection time on the measuring instrument. It also improve the part quality through process control. In this research, the component inspection is performed by optical machine tool probe when position into the spindle of CNC milling machine. The relative movement between the probe and job are programmed by developing a CNC part program. The probe touches the machined surface as per the program codes and the optical machine interface (Transceiver) receives signal data through infrared optical waves and these signals transformed into the CNC controller through wired network. The CNC controller displays the data points on the screen. These data points were transferred into CAD system for generating lines, curves and thereafter surfaces and these generated surfaces were analysed against CAD model of the designed component for dimensional evaluation.
