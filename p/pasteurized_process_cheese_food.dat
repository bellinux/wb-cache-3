50|$|Cheese is a main {{ingredient}} in cheese soup, and is typically {{used in the}} dish in grated form or in chunks or pieces. Cheeses used include hard cheeses like Cheddar, Gruyère and Parmesan cheese and soft ones such as farmer cheese, Gouda cheese, muenster cheese, queso blanco and queso Chihuahua. The cheese adds both flavor and nutritional value to the soup. Processed cheese (including Velveeta), such as pasteurized process cheese and <b>pasteurized</b> <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> <b>food</b> is sometimes used instead of natural cheese. Some cheese soups have a rich flavor and may be high in fat due {{to the use of}} high-fat ingredients such as butter and heavy cream, in addition to the fat in the cheese. Fat content of the soup can be reduced by the use of ingredients such as low- or non-fat cheese, fat-free milk and fat-free stock.|$|E

40|$|Three {{batches of}} milk were ultrafiltered to 60, 65, or 70 % volume {{reduction}} before diafiltration. Starting diafiltration at 70 % volume reduction took less time and water without affecting nutrient recovery. Whole milk was heated to 60, 72, and 82 °C for 16 s. Milk representing each heat treatment {{was divided into}} three batches, one unacidified (pH 6. 6), the others acidified to pH 6. 2 and 5. 8. The milk was ultrafiltered, diafiltered, and concentrated to 5 x (80 % volume reduction). Retentate was inoculated with. 5 % lactic culture and incubated at 28 °C to pH 5. 1. Each lot of fermented retentate was evaporated under 76 kPa vacuum until moisture was reduced to 35 - 38 %, then made into <b>pasteurized</b> <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> <b>food</b> by cooking to 82 °C. The final product contained 43 - 44 % moisture, 24 - 28 % fat, 1. 7 % salt, and 2. 5 % sodium citrate. Fat and protein recovery were not affected by heat treatment or pH adjustment of the milk. Recovery of calcium, phosphorus, and riboflavin were significantly reduced following acidification of milk. Riboflavin recovery was higher when milk was preheated to 60 °C as opposed to 72 or 82 °C. Effect of cooking temperature on meltability of process cheese food was evaluated by repeating the above experiment at three cooking temperatures, 70, 76, or 81 °C. Cooking temperature significantly affected meltability. Cheese cooked to 70 °C melted best for all treatments. At all cooking temperatures, cheese from unacidified milk (pH 6. 6) had greater meltability than cheese from milk acidified to pH 5. 8 or 6. 2. Cooking temperature had a greater effect on meltability of process cheese food made from ultrafiltered retentate than calcium content. Preheating milk before ultrafiltration did not significantly affect meltability of <b>pasteurized</b> <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> <b>food.</b> Meltability of <b>pasteurized</b> <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> <b>food</b> was best when made from retentate heated (following ultrafiltration) to 61 °C for 16 sand poorest when retentate was heated to 72 or 83 °C. During ultrafiltration without diafiltration, amino acid analysis was on samples taken at 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 % volume reduction. There were no differences in amino acid composition (g/ 100 g protein) between milk and 5 x retentate. Soluble nitrogen at pH 4. 6 in <b>pasteurized</b> <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> <b>food</b> was an approximate measure of undenatgred whey protein. As processing temperature increased from 66 to 82 °C, undenatured whey protein decreased. Decrease in meltability due to increased processing temperature was related to denaturation of whey protein. Process cheese food made from blends of UF curd and Cheddar cheese had acceptable meltability with up to 66 % UF curd when the final processing temperature was 68 °C. Milk with high bacterial numbers (7. 8 x 106 CFU/ml) was heated to 72 °C for 16 s, acidified to pH 5. 8 and ultrafiltered to a 5 x concentration.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate and compare the effects of potassium chloride (KCl) and potassium based emulsifying salts as a salt (NaCl) replacer on the chemical, physical, microbiological and sensory characteristics of <b>pasteurized</b> <b>processed</b> <b>cheese.</b> The treatment 1 (T 1) was made using the potassium chloride (KCl) and the treatment 2 (T 2) was made using a mixture of 50 % of potassium chloride and 50 % of sodium chloride (NaCl+KCl). The control sample of <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> was made using the sodium chloride (NaCl) only. The <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> samples were analyzed for chemical (fat, moisture, protein, salt, pH, and meltability), physical (hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, chewiness and gumminess), microbiological (total plate, coliform, yeast, and mold counts), and sensory (color, texture, and saltiness) characteristics. The results of fat content, moisture content, pH and meltability in T 1 and T 2 were not significantly different than the control, but in the microbial results, the control had the lowest number of microbial counts followed by T 1 and T 2. The replacement of NaCl using KCl had a significant effect on sensory properties including hardness, bitterness and saltiness of <b>processed</b> <b>cheese.</b> In conclusion, potassium chloride has high potential for use as a salt replacer without changing the chemical properties, but it has limited 314 Journal of Student Research application for use in <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> because of short shelf life and low sensory qualities compared with the control.

40|$|Four {{batches of}} <b>pasteurized</b> <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> were {{prepared}} {{from the same}} Cheddar cheese by cooking to 82 C {{in the presence of}} sodium citrate, disodium phosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate or sodium aluminum phosphate. Each batch contained the same moisture (40. 6 %) and emulsifying salt concentration (2. 5 %). The <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> was sampled for microstructural and rheological examination after 0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 min in the cooker at 82 C. Even though each emulsifying salt affected the physical properties of the <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> differently, the cheese generally became firmer, stiffer, more elastic and less meltable as cooking time increased from 0 to 40 min. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in the dimension of fat masses and an increase in the degree of emulsification as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The degree of emulsification (fineness of fat particles) seemed directly related to firmness, poor meltability, toughness, breaking force, apparent stiffness modulus, degree of elasticity, apparent ultimate stress and inversely related to hysteresis and apparent ultimate strain. Tetrasodium pyrophosphate produced the most rapid emulsification of the fat in the cheese and sodium aluminum phosphate the slowest. The effect of the other salts was intermediate. The softest most meltable cheese was poorly emulsified while the firmest most sliceable was well emulsified. Sodium citrate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate crystals remained undissolved in the cheese after 40 min in the cooker while sodium aluminum phosphate crystals were still undissolved after 10 min. There was a close statistical relationship among several of the rheological measurements viz. meltability and firmness, toughness and breaking force, and meltability and breaking force. Future rheological studies on <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> should not require all of the above measurements. An increase in the fineness of the fat emulsion as determined by scanning electron microscopy was generally accompanied by increased firmness, poorer meltability and increased toughness...|$|R
