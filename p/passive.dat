40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} how children comprehend event <b>passives</b> and state <b>passives</b> in Mandarin {{and whether they}} can distinguish {{these two types of}} <b>passives</b> or not. Chinese action verbs were classified into three types: achievement, destructive, and creative. Each verb type was involved in a picture identification task using two kinds of <b>passives,</b> event and state <b>passives.</b> Sixty children grouped according to age (4, 5 and 6 -year-olds) as well as twenty adults completed the tasks. Results showed that adults and 6 -year-olds could distinguish event <b>passives</b> from state <b>passives,</b> while younger subjects were liable to treat event <b>passives</b> as state <b>passives.</b> Young Mandarin-speaking children (4 and 5 -year-olds) tend to analyze event <b>passives</b> as equivalent to the corresponding state <b>passives,</b> whose structures are similar to adjectival constructions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceImpersonal <b>passives</b> are <b>passives</b> of intransitive verbs. Applying passivisation to an intransitive verb {{results in}} a derived verb-form with no {{referential}} argument; the surface subject of the construction is then either absent or realised by an expletive subject. Consequently, the analysis of impersonal <b>passives</b> inherits the complexities {{of at least three}} related domains: (i) the cross-linguistic definition of <b>passives</b> in general, (ii) the analysis of subjectless sentences and (iii) the syntax of sentences withexpletive subjects. The first section reviews the most influential characterisations of <b>passives</b> in the literature in terms of subject demotion and object promotion. The analyses of impersonal <b>passives</b> in the literature will be presented against this general backdrop. The second section presents evidence that subject demotion does not yield a uniform class of <b>passives</b> based on the literature on Romance, Celtic, Slavic and Germanic. In particular, constructions that suppress the logical subject differ in whether they yield a syntactically transitive or intransitive output when applied to a transitive verb. Based on this observation, {{it has been argued that}} constructions that suppress the subject but do not de-transitivise the underlying verb should not be analysed as passives; instead these constructions should be treated as impersonal verb forms, more similar to transitive sentences with an overt impersonal subject such as Engl. one, French on, Germanic man/men than to <b>passives.</b> Arguably, this distinction between valency reducing <b>passives</b> and valency-preserving impersonals is preserved when the relevant constructions are applied to intransitive verbs. The final section examines the question what role overt expletives play in the syntax of impersonal <b>passives.</b> The literature on expletives constructions in Germanic and particularly in Scandinavian provides a wealth of data that will be used to place the overt expletive subject found with impersonal <b>passives</b> in the context of expletive constructions more generally...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates children’s {{acquisition}} of benefactives and <b>passives</b> in Japanese. It has {{been pointed out}} that Japanese complex constructions with mora-w (receive) are acquired later than their counterparts with age-ru (give) (Uyeno et al. 1978). Also, many researchers report that <b>passives</b> are more difficult for children than active counterparts (Borer and Wexler 1987, Fox and Grodzinsky 1998, among others). In this paper, we first argue that benefactives and <b>passives</b> in Japanese share the similar syntactic properties such as movement and case-marking pattern. In particular, both mora-w (receive) benefactives and <b>passives</b> are derived from their age-ru (give) and active counterparts by movement which forms A-chain. Moreover, ni-phrases (by-phrases in English) both benefactives and <b>passives</b> contain can be replaced by kara-phrases (from-phrases) expressing source theta-role. Based on the observation, we examine the results of experiment we conducted with three native Japanese children. The results lead us {{to claim that the}} reason why mora-w (receive) benefactives and <b>passives</b> are difficult for children lies in the Agent marking ni-phrase (by-phrases) rather than in movement, rejecting the previous researches on both benefactives and <b>passives.</b> 1...|$|R
5|$|<b>Passive</b> constructions {{also use}} {{auxiliary}} verbs. A <b>passive</b> construction rephrases an active construction {{in such a}} way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the <b>passive</b> phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get. For example, putting the sentence she sees him into the <b>passive</b> becomes he is seen (by her), or he gets seen (by her).|$|E

40|$|This paper argues {{against the}} view that Japanese {{indirect}} <b>passives</b> are restricted {{with respect to the}} base verb that they take. Specifically, it argues that, despite its initial plausibility, the oft-proposed generalization that unaccusatives cannot appear in indirect <b>passives</b> is too strong and the alleged distribution is a tendency at most, albeit a strong one. After closely examining the restriction along with the counterevidence discussed in the literature, this paper presents novel empirical evidence against the restriction. Moreover, it also argues that no stipulations specific to indirect <b>passives</b> need to be introduced in accounting for the purported evidence for the unaccusative restriction: pragmatic inferences {{play a crucial role in}} deriving the observed aversion to unaccusative-based indirect <b>passives.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{a set of}} {{surprising}} contrasts {{between two}} major classes of adjectives in Tagalog. It is concerned, in particular, with the discovery that adjectival <b>passives</b> in Tagalog cannot occur as the main predicate of various types of impersonal clauses—i. e., clause types in which the adjective’s sole argument cannot be promoted to subject. I argue that this fact follows ultimately from the claim that adjectival <b>passives</b> are unaccusative. This claim is compared with the observation that, in many other languages (e. g., Hebrew), adjectival <b>passives</b> apparently pattern as unergative. I explore the hypothesis that differences relating to the argument structure of adjectival <b>passives</b> {{can be related to}} larger architectural differences among languages, relating—in particular—to the structure of VP...|$|R

The post state vs. target state ambiguity of adjectival <b>passives</b> is accounted for by deriving the two readings from a semantically underspecified representation that requires the pragmatic machinery to infer a suitable contextual instantiation. ...|$|R
