The radio observations reveal a compact (< 0. 2 pc) nuclear source with a spectrum that turns over sharply near 5 GHz.

40|$|A rising {{concern in}} our society is {{preventing}} the proliferation {{of nuclear weapons and}} fissionable material. This prevention can be incorporated at multiple levels, from the use of nuclear safeguards in nuclear facilities to the detection of threat objects in the field. At any level, systems used for such tasks need to be specially designed for use with Special Nuclear Material (SNM) which is defined by the NRC as plutonium and uranium enriched in U- 233 or U- 235 isotopes. These radioactive materials have the particularity of emitting both fast neutrons and gamma rays; thus, systems able to detect both particles simultaneously are particularly desirable. In the field of nuclear nonproliferation and safeguards, detection systems capable of accurately imaging various sources of radiation can greatly simplify any monitoring or detection task. The localization of the radiation sources can allow users of the system to focus their efforts on the areas of interest, whether it be for radiation detection or radiation characterization. This thesis describes the development of a dual-particle imaging system at the University of Michigan to address these technical challenges. The imaging system relies on the use of organic liquid scintillators that can detect both fast neutrons and gamma rays, and inorganic NaI(Tl) scintillators that are not very sensitive to neutrons yet yield <b>photoelectric</b> <b>absorptions</b> from gamma rays. A prototype of the imaging system has been constructed and operated. The system will aid the remote monitoring of nuclear materials within facilities, and it has the scalability for standoff detection in the field. A software suite has been developed to analyze measured data in real time, in an effort to obtain a system as close to field-ready as possible. The system’s performance has been tested with various materials of interest, such as MOX and plutonium metal, measured at the PERLA facility of the Joint Research Center in Ispra, Italy.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of {{simultaneous}} XMM-Newton X-ray and 3. 5 m/CAHA optical spectroscopic observations of the Seyfert galaxy Mrk 993. This galaxy exhibited in the past significant variations of its broad emission lines which classified it as Sy 1, Sy 1. 5 and Sy 1. 9 in different epochs. In order to test the X-ray/optical consistency of the unified AGN model we have compared the amount of <b>photoelectric</b> X-ray <b>absorption</b> with the Balmer decrement of broad emission line components. The optical data show that during our observations Mrk 993 was in a Sy 1. 8 state with a Balmer decrement of 9. The X-ray absorbing gas amounts only to 7 E 20 cmE- 02, most likely due to the host galaxy. For a normal gas to dust ratio in the absorbing material (expected to arise in the molecular torus) both quantities are clearly discrepant with an intrinsic Balmer decrement of 3. 4. We therefore conclude that the Balmer ratio is intrinsic rather than produced by obscuration and therefore that in this object the optical broad line emission properties are dictated by the physics of the broad line region rather than orientation/obscuration effects.

40|$|Accretion is a {{fundamental}} process which establishes {{the dynamics of the}} protoplanetary disk and the final properties of the forming star. In solar-type stars, the star-disk coupling is determined by the magnetic field structure, which is responsible for funneling material from the disk midplane to higher latitudes on the star. Here, we use pan-chromatic data for the Herbig Ae star MWC 480 to address whether similar processes occur in intermediate-mass stars. MWC 480 has X-ray emission typical of actively accreting Herbig Ae stars, but with 5 - 9 x more <b>photoelectric</b> <b>absorption</b> than expected from optical and FUV data. We consider 3 sources for the absorption: the disk absorption in a wind or jet, and accretion. While we detect the disk in scattered light in are-analysis of archival HST data. the data are consistent with grazing illumination of the dust disk. We find that MWC 480 's disk is stratified, geometrically thin, and is not responsible for the observed <b>photoelectric</b> <b>absorption.</b> MWC 480 drives a bipolar jet, but with a mass loss rate which is low compared to other Herbig Ae stars, where the outflow is more favorably oriented and enhanced <b>photoelectric</b> <b>absorption</b> is not seen.

40|$|Abstract. If γ-ray bursts are {{associated}} with dense star-forming regions in young galaxies, <b>photoelectric</b> <b>absorption</b> by the dense circumburster material (CBM) will occur. As the burst evolves, the surrounding material is photoionized, leading to fluorescence line emission and reduced <b>photoelectric</b> <b>absorption</b> opacity. We have analyzed this process in detail, accounting for the time-dependent <b>photoelectric</b> <b>absorption,</b> photoionization and fluorescence line emission from the CBM. We find that even if GRBs are hosted in dense star-forming regions, photoionization of the GRB environment leads to a constant, but very weak level of delayed fluorescence line emission on timescales of weeks to years after the burst. A temporally evolving iron K edge absorption feature can serve as diagnostic tool to reveal the density structure of the CBM and may {{provide an opportunity for}} redshift measurements. We also investigated whether <b>photoelectric</b> <b>absorption</b> could be responsible for the spectral evolution of the low-energy slopes of some bright BATSE γ-ray bursts displaying extremely hard spectra below the peak energy, inconsistent with the optically-thin synchrotron shock model. We find that a very strong metal enrichment (∼ 100 times solar-system abundances) in the γ-ray burst environment and a rather peculiar spatial distribution of the CBM would be necessary in order to account for the observed hard spectra below a few 100 keV and their temporal evolution.
