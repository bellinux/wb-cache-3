[...] Music writer Richard Goldstein relates his impression of Wilson based on a meeting in 1967: [...] "He came across as ... deeply insecure about his creative instincts, terrified that the songs he was working on were too arty to sell."

500|$|After {{months of}} {{recording}} and media hype, the original Smile project was shelved due to corporate pressures, technical problems, internal power struggles, and legal stalling. Business partner David Anderle attempted to form Brother Records, an independent label, {{with the intention}} of giving [...] "entirely new concepts to the recording industry, and to give the Beach Boys total creative and promotional control over their product." [...] A March 1967 lawsuit seeking $255,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) was launched against Capitol Records over neglected royalty payments. Within the lawsuit, there was also an attempt to terminate the band's contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiry. Band quarrels led Parks to leave the project in April 1967, with Anderle following suit weeks later. Dennis Wilson explained that the group had become [...] "very paranoid about the possibility of losing our public.... Drugs played a great role in our evolution but as a result we were frightened that people would no longer understand us, musically." [...] Brian said that Smile leftovers like [...] "Surf's Up" [...] were left unreleased because he lacked a [...] "commercial feeling" [...] for those songs, surmising that [...] "Maybe some <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> hang on to certain songs as their own little songs that they've written, almost for themselves.

2500|$|After {{privatisation}} in 1982, British Telecom {{introduced the}} KX100, a more utilitarian design, which began to replace {{most of the}} existing boxes. The KX100 {{was one of a}} series of designs, including the wheelchair-accessible open-sided KX200, and the triangular-footprint KX300. In January 1985, [...] Nick Kane, the Director of Marketing for BT Local Communications Services announced that the old red telephone boxes would be replaced because they [...] "...no longer meet the needs of our customers. Few <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> use them. They are expensive and difficult to clean and maintain and cannot be used by handicapped people". This time, BT did not relent, despite another vociferous campaign. Many local authorities used legislation designed to protect buildings of architectural or historic importance to keep old telephone boxes in prominent locations and around 2,000 of them were given listed status. Several thousand others were left on low-revenue mostly rural sites but many thousands of recovered K2 and K6 boxes were sold off. Some kiosks have been converted to be used as shower cubicles in private homes. In Kingston upon Thames a number of old K6 boxes have been used to form a work of art resembling a row of fallen dominoes. It is estimated that 11,000 traditional red telephone boxes remain in public service. The KX+, better known as the KX100 PLUS, introduced in 1996 featured a domed roof reminiscent of the familiar K2 and K6. Subsequent designs have departed significantly from the old style red boxes. BT followed the KX series with the Multi.phone in 1999 and the ST6 in 2007.|$|E

[...] Head of BBC Children's, Joe Godwin said: [...] "Our young viewers are our priority and the vast majority of children in the UK already tune in to CBeebies and CBBC to find their favourite BBC children's programmes.
