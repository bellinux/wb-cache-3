5|$|The first <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering</b> on {{any type}} of vehicle dates to 1876, but little is {{recorded}} of the system. Other {{attempts were made to}} add <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering</b> to motorized vehicles such as in the 1903 Columbia 5-ton truck and other heavy vehicles, {{but it was not until}} 1928 that a practical hydraulic power system was invented by Francis W. Davis. It was used on some armored vehicles and heavy trucks during World War II, but it took more than decades before the system was commercialized in passenger automobiles.|$|E
25|$|The SIBMAS {{was built}} with <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering,</b> {{automatic}} transmission, and run-flat tyres. It {{could also be}} fitted with night vision sights, a {{nuclear biological and chemical}} (NBC) protection suite, an electrical air conditioning system, heater, and a winch.|$|E
500|$|Chrysler {{introduced}} the first commercially available passenger car power-steering {{system on the}} 1951 Chrysler Imperial, marketed {{under the name of}} Hydraguide. [...] The option was available for less than $200. General Motors followed suit the next year, offering it as an option for the 1952 Cadillac. Two years later, Cadillac was the first manufacturer to offer <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering</b> as standard equipment.|$|E

50|$|The <b>power-assisted</b> {{rack-and-pinion}} <b>steering</b> {{is connected}} to an adjustable steering column that is topped by a custom Motolita steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|It did offer a {{combination}} of features which were advanced in this category in Australia at the time: rack and pinion <b>steering,</b> <b>power-assisted</b> disc brakes, MacPherson strut front suspension, front hinged bonnet, glued-in windscreen and concealed windscreen wipers, {{as well as the}} familiar Australian-made Borg Warner gearboxes (including 3 speed column shift) and a live rear axle.|$|R
500|$|Terai Engineering {{attempted}} {{to enter the}} J2X-C at the 500 km of Suzuka in April 1992, but the car was far from ready, and did not attend. The J2X-C was first tested on 9 July 1992, with Costas Los selected to drive it at Pembrey Circuit. He said of the car; [...] "the J2X felt very different to a regular Group C car... Contrary to most Group C cars I had driven, {{it was a lot}} more tuneable than I was accustomed to." [...] However, he did state that the car's lack of <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering</b> was a problem. The team struggled to find a buyer for the car, as the Group C era was drawing to a close by 1992 and 1993; the IMSA GTP Championship was on its last legs, and the World Sportscar Championship was beginning to shift away from the category.|$|E
2500|$|The car was {{introduced}} in September 1968. <b>Power-assisted</b> <b>steering</b> and leather upholstery were standard on the 2.8L De Luxe and 4.2L models and air conditioning was offered as an optional extra on the 4.2L. Daimler versions were launched in October 1969, {{in a series of}} television advertisements featuring Sir William. In these spots, he referred to the car as [...] "the finest Jaguar ever". An unusual feature, inherited from the Mark X and S-Type saloons, was the provision of twin fuel tanks, positioned {{on each side of the}} boot / trunk, and filled using two separately lockable filler caps: one on the top of each wing above the rear wheel arches. Preliminary reviews of the car were favourable, noting the effective brakes and good ride quality.|$|E
50|$|There were 2.2 turns {{lock to lock}} for the <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering</b> or 2.5 for unassisted.|$|E

[...] The disk brakes are controlled via a four-channel Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution and Brake Assist. [...] Although 60 mph to 0 stopping distances of 117 ft to 195 ft have been reported, the average appears to be between 140 ft and 147 ft.|$|R
50|$|The Didgori is {{assembled}} on {{and around}} the chassis of US Ford Super Duty F-550 heavy duty pickup trucks with V8 Power Stroke Turbo Diesel engines and <b>power-assisted</b> hydraulic <b>steering.</b> The product basis choice has proven very effective during trials and in the field on various types of terrain.The max. speed on paved roads is 120-140 km/h and reduced to 80 km/h on terrain. Acceleration from 0-100 km/h is achieved in 22 seconds. The cruising range at 60 km/h is 500 km. Each unit {{has at least one}} 20 L fuel can in reserve. The vehicle can operate at temperatures ranging from -32 °C to +55 °C and remains unaffected by heavy meteorological conditions. The wheels consist of Hutchinson 12r20 mpt80 type tyres which have a run flat capability of 50 km at 50 km/h. The Didgori has 400mm ground clearance and is able to climb slopes at a 60% gradient and drive sideways along a slope at a 40% gradient. The vehicle base version is not amphibious - although such a variant is an option, but can move in up to 1m deep water.|$|R
50|$|In automobiles, power {{steering}} (also <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering</b> (PAS) or steering assist system) helps drivers steer by augmenting steering {{effort of the}} steering wheel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Power-assisted</b> <b>steering</b> was standard, {{the later}} 4.2 cars {{receiving}} Marles Varamatic Bendix (Adwest) variable ratio steering boxes, designed by an Australian, Arthur Bishop.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the advanced engine, the SVO featured several key modifications over the standard Mustang to help increase performance. The front suspension geometry was modified, 15:1 ratio <b>power-assisted</b> rack-and-pinion <b>steering</b> system replaced the standard system, a limited slip, 3.45:1, 7.5" [...] Traction-Lok axle was added {{for the first year}} of production (later models used a 3.73:1 ratio, 7.5" [...] axle), a new, ventilated four-wheel-disc braking system (sourced from the Fox platform Continental Mark VII) replaced the GT's disc/drum setup (a first for the Mustang), specially designed pedals were used to aid [...] "heel-and-toe" [...] shifting and a complete KONI suspension system featuring specially tuned adjustable front struts, rear shocks, and horizontal rear dampers replaced the setup used on the Mustang GT. Five-lug, 16 × 7-inch aluminum wheels with P225-50R16 VR Goodyear Eagle [...] "Gatorback" [...] tires were standard, as well (originally with German Goodyear NCT tires, and later Gatorbacks). The rear disc brakes, the five-lug hubs, the 16-inch (406 mm) wheels, the quad-shock rear end (early 84 units used a solid steel traction bar with a rubber cover), and the KONIs were used on the SVO before any other Mustang.|$|R
5000|$|... 1953 was Ford's 50th anniversary. The {{big news}} for 1953 was the {{availability}} of <b>power-assisted</b> brakes and <b>steering,</b> which had previously been limited to the Mercury and Lincoln lines. The center grill bullet lost its ring and was now flanked by vertical black stripes, while the corner markers were plain rectangular lights rather than the circular [...] "intakes". All 1953 Fords featured commemorative steering wheels marking the company's 50th anniversary. Mechanical changes included two-inch wider tread, and a k-bar frame with five cross-members. [...] William Clay Ford paced the Indianapolis 500 in a Sunliner convertible with a dummy Continental tire kit (Coronado kit). [...] This was also {{the last year for}} real wood trim on the Country Squire wagon. Toward the end of the year, Ford added [...] "Master-Guide" [...] power steering as an option on cars with V8s. Full instrumentation was still used. An unusual service provided by Ford was that the radio preset buttons would already be set to local stations by the dealer. The heater was $74.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Swinger" [...] {{name was}} applied to all the Dart two-door hardtops except in the high-line custom series. A number of other changes {{were made to the}} Dart line to avoid {{internal}} competition with Dodge's new Challenger: the Dart convertible was discontinued along with the optional 383 cuin L V8, leaving the [...] 340 4-barrel V8 as the top Dart engine. The performance model in the Dart line for 1970 was the Swinger 340 2-door hardtop. The 1970 Swinger 340 came with functional hood scoops with 340 emblems. Standard equipment included front disc brakes (only on the Swinger), heavy duty [...] "Rallye" [...] suspension, a 3.23:1 rear axle ratio, fiberglass-belted bias-ply tires mounted to 14" [...] × 5½" [...] steel wheels, and a bumble bee stripe. Optional equipment included an upgrade over the standard bench seat with all-vinyl bucket seats, with which a center console could be ordered. A performance hood upgrade with scoops was painted flat black with hood tie-down pins. Mechanical options included <b>power-assisted</b> brakes and <b>steering.</b> Rallye wheels and wire wheel covers were also optional, as was a 6000 rpm tachometer and a vinyl roof covering in black or white.|$|R
50|$|A short- & long-arm (SLA) {{independent}} front suspension with speed-sensitive <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering</b> was {{combined with}} a multi-link rear live axle. Optional equipment included off-road under-body skid-plate protection, Traction-Lok rear limited-slip differential, and a heavy-duty trailer towing package.|$|E
50|$|A {{naturally}} aspirated version {{known as the}} GX was offered in the Japanese market, with production ending in 1983. The Starion GX was offered without power windows, air conditioning, independent rear suspension, fuel injection or <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|E
50|$|The SIBMAS {{was built}} with <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering,</b> {{automatic}} transmission, and run-flat tyres. It {{could also be}} fitted with night vision sights, a {{nuclear biological and chemical}} (NBC) protection suite, an electrical air conditioning system, heater, and a winch.|$|E
50|$|The {{two major}} {{complaints}} {{of the vehicle}} in the civilian market were poor fuel consumption and poor ride quality especially in the rear seats. The suspension was indeed harsh with live axles and leaf springs all around. It features almost no creature comforts, like power-windows and <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|E
50|$|Also {{inherited}} from the previous model was the combination of disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear, but now with twin braking circuits as an additional safety feature, and servo-assistance. The 26M received enlarged front brake discs to complement its <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering,</b> twin halogen headlights, and twin exhaust pipes.|$|E
50|$|Wheeled {{vehicles}} {{have the}} advantage of being cheaper to build and easier to maintain with greater mobility. Tire pressure can be regulated to allow good mobility off-road and there is <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering</b> on the front four wheels. It lowers 3 hydraulic stabilizers into the ground prior to firing, and has a roof mounted crane to assist with ammunition loading.|$|E
50|$|The second {{generation}} Rogue is {{a version of}} Nissan X-Trail and inspired by the Hi-Cross Concept to adapt to North American market. Changes include optional third row 7 passenger seating, standard 4-wheel independent suspension, electric <b>power-assisted</b> <b>Steering,</b> 4-wheel disc brakes with an anti-lock braking system. This generation has an interior size similar to Nissan's Murano, Altima, and Maxima.|$|E

50|$|March 1975 - Introduction of the Renault 30 TS, a large 5-door {{hatchback}} {{available in}} only one specification, the TS with the 2664 cc V6 PRV engine (developed jointly between Peugeot, Renault and Volvo), with a choice between a 4-speed manual or 3-speed automatic gearbox. The R30 TS had <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering,</b> four round Quartz-Iodide headlights, electric front windows and central locking.|$|E
5000|$|The 600 was {{available}} {{in a number of}} different trims. All models had <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering</b> (PAS), electric front windows, remote central locking with alarm and immobiliser and tinted windows. The Si had split rear seats, Si Auto and above got a sunroof. SLi trim added electric rear windows and wooden door trim; GSi models received 15" [...] multispoke alloys and full leather trim.|$|E
50|$|The Ford EcoSport comes {{equipped}} {{with a variety of}} features, including the latest Ford SYNC driver connect system, a unique voice command system co-developed with Microsoft. Advanced climate control and a centrally mounted LCD screen with SYNC controls are also included. Safety features include Airbags, Seat belts, anti-lock brakes (ABS), electronic stability program (ESP), electric <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering</b> (EPAS) with Hill Launch Assist and rear parking sensors.|$|E
50|$|Standard {{equipment}} on both models includes air-conditioning, driver and front passenger air-bags, CD/radio head unit, ABS brakes, EBD, trip computer, central locking, power-assisted windows, power-assisted side mirrors, <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering,</b> reflector halogen headlamps, and folding seats. Optional extras {{can be purchased}} from Honda Dealers/Service Centers all around Malaysia at retail price. A three-year warranty is standard for all Jazz models purchased from authorized Honda dealers in Malaysia.|$|E
5000|$|The Cappuccino {{featured}} 4-wheel {{disc brakes}} and rear wheel drive. Later versions in Japan had an early production iteration of speed-sensing electric <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering</b> and aluminium double wishbone suspension. Production began in 1991 and ceased in 1997. The Cappuccino's closest competitor {{of the time}} were the Autozam AZ-1, Honda Beat and the Daihatsu Leeza Spyder. (The Autozam AZ-1, Honda Beat and Suzuki Cappuccino were together called the Sporty K-Car's ABC.) ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{advertised in}} The Times, Friday, 2 October 1959: The {{cylinder}} block and heads are cast in aluminum alloy and hydraulic tappets operate the overhead valves. The engine has a compression ratio of 8 to 1 and is fitted with twin carburetors with automatic choke.Other features available include fully automatic transmission, <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering,</b> electrically operated ride control, redesigned and more flexible air conditioning, electric rear window demisters and press button window lifts.|$|E
50|$|These models also {{received}} a 1 in lowered ride height with a performance-tuned suspension and unique front and rear body kits. The lower stance is accented by the 18 inch 5-spoke chrome wheels {{and the absence of}} the roof rack, giving them a smoother design flow compared to the standard models. The GXP had twin hood scoops, hydraulic <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering</b> (as opposed to the electric power-assisted standard Torrent), improved interior trim with unique gauges, and a dual chrome-tipped exhaust.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} independents also took the PD3 and the Ulster Transport Authority took {{examples}} with fully fronted MCW bodies finished by the operator. Some of these on PD3/5 chassis had the newly optional O.680 11.1-litre 150 bhp engine and a luggage boot, {{for use on}} Belfast Airport services; some of the PD3/4s for rural routes also had a rear luggage boot, while the PD3/4s allocated to Derry City had the first instance of <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering</b> on a Leyland double-decker.|$|E
5000|$|The FW16 {{featured}} <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering,</b> hydraulically driven and {{reacting to}} input from electronic sensors, {{a system that}} drew heavily from the knowledge gained from the teams active suspension technology. It lacked the fully automatic gear change system of the preceding year and was restricted to a [...] "semi-automatic" [...] transmission. In accordance with the new 1994 regulations, the FW16 did not have adjustable anti-roll bar controls accessible by the driver from the cockpit, which was present in FW15C and earlier Williams F1 cars.|$|E
50|$|This action puts {{strain on}} the rack and pinion, pump, tie rods, and bearings, {{especially}} causes undue wear to the steer wheels, and can be exceptionally difficult {{in the absence of}} <b>power-assisted</b> <b>steering.</b> Although in most modern cars the steering components are sturdy enough to handle dry steering without taking damage, it is still not recommended due to stronger tire wear. This is the reason automatic parking systems are usually designed not to dry steer, although their design would be somewhat simpler if they used dry steering.|$|E
