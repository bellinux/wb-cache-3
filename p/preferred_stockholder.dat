40|$|This Article {{examines}} whether corporations should owe {{fiduciary duties}} to its preferred stockholders as preferred stockholders across all settings of preferred stock holding. In one context, sophisticated venture capitalists purchase preferred stock after carefully negotiating the stock price, {{control over the}} corporate governance, and other key stipulations by contract. Additionally, because the initial <b>preferred</b> <b>stockholder</b> could protect its interests through staged financing or board control, the <b>preferred</b> <b>stockholder</b> might not discount the stock even if it lacked protection since the other protective devices made the lack of such protections inconsequential so the initial holders won’t pay for these added fiduciary protections. In such settings {{it does not make}} sense for the corporation to owe fiduciary duties to the preferred stockholders as preferred. In fact, doing so rearranges the basis on which the initial stockholders purchased the stock and implying a fiduciary term constitutes a hit to the common stockholders and thus ignores the terms of the claimants and the risk and targeted return for each of them. However, while it makes sense for sophisticated venture capitalists to rely only on bargained-for contractual protections, this Article identifies two specific contexts where a limited fiduciary obligation should be extended to preferred stockholders who lack bargaining power. The first is when non-working children are given preferred stock in a family business. The second is when a corporation takes on a new unfamiliar product line, allowing common stockholders to wipe out the value of publicly traded preferred stock. When the preferred stock is purchased in the public marketplace, the preferred stockholders will not have any bargaining power in the preferred stock’s contractual arrangement. Moreover, the additional terms routine in shareholder agreements between VC’s and founders are almost never found in the Charter documents, so those provisions won’t be transferable. To the subsequent purchaser of preferred stock the lack of such protections might call for a limited fiduciary duty if the markets for preferred stock are not as efficient as for common stock or if there are chinks in the efficient capital market hypothesis. Where the disciplining effects of the market are weaker, subsequent buyers of the preferred stock may not price the stock accurately to reflect the lack of transferable protections, providing a justification for a limited fiduciary duty in that context if implying the term would add value. to be published by the Rutgers University Law Review...|$|E
40|$|Marilyn Cane, Recent Developments Concerning <b>Preferred</b> <b>Stockholder</b> Rights Under Deleware Law, 5 Virginia Law 2 ̆ 6 Business Review 377 (2011). This is {{a timely}} article {{focusing}} on the conflicting duties owed to preferred and common stockholders. Delaware is the leading corporate law jurisdiction in the United States. Preferred stock is a key component in angel and venture capital transactions. Historically the Delaware courts have accepted as a general principle the proposition that since the preferred rights are contractual in nature, they must be expressly defined in the preferred stock contract {{in order for the}} preferred to successfully assert those rights. Accordingly, the directors owe correlative duties to the preferred {{to the extent that the}} rights are articulated in the contract. The Delaware courts maintained such position for many decades. In contrast, the Jedwab decision rendered in 1986 stated that the application of the general rule is confined to the situation where the matters relate to the preferences themselves. The Jedwab court then held that where the right asserted by the preferred does not relate to a preference as against the common stockholders, but rather the rights shared equally with the common, then fiduciary, rather than contractual, principles apply. Controversy ensued as to whether the Jedwabdecision was an exception to, or a violation of, the general rule. In connection with the proposition that the directors’ duties to the preferred are limited to the extent that the preferred rights are defined in the contract, the recently decidedTrados case added another layer to the ongoing debate. In 2009, the Trados court addressed the issue of whether directors breached their duty of loyalty to the common stockholders by improperly favoring the interests of the preferred stockholders. In that case, the court determined that it is possible a director could breach her duty by improperly favoring the interests of the preferred over those of the common. The court examined the role of directors who were affiliated with preferred stock investors, which is not an uncommon situation in venture and start-up capital situations. As a consequence, this case will likely have a significant impact on corporate lawyers and their clients. The Trados decision has been discussed both in the press and at major continuing legal education conferences. In March of 2010, the Delaware Court, in the LC Capital case, attempted to reconcile the Trados decision with the Jedwab decision.

40|$|Preferred {{stock has}} always posed {{something}} of a puzzle. Straddling the line between debt and equity, preferred stock has long existed in a shadowland between the realms of contract law on the one hand, and corporate law on the other. Depending on the situation, <b>preferred</b> <b>stockholders</b> have sometimes been entitled {{to the protection of}} corporate law fiduciary duties, and sometimes been left to lie in the contractual bed they have made. Historically, what little scholarship exists on preferred stock has consisted largely of calls for greater fiduciary protections for <b>preferred</b> <b>stockholders.</b> <b>Preferred</b> stock has taken on increased importance in recent years, as the favored mode of investment for venture capitalists. Moreover, in a recent trio of cases, the Delaware Chancery Court has restated – some have claimed re-made – the doctrinal treatment of preferred stock in venture capital deals, generating substantial confusion in the process. This Article takes a fresh look at the role of fiduciary duties in venture capital deals, examining the traditional rationales for fiduciary duties in corporate law and analyzing {{the extent to which they}} apply in the context of venture capital-financed startups. I conclude that the traditional rationales do not apply, and that venture capitalists, as <b>preferred</b> <b>stockholders,</b> should never be afforded fiduciary protections. Where <b>preferred</b> <b>stockholders</b> control the board, however, they should owe fiduciary duties to the common stockholders. Taken together, these conclusions provide what has long been lacking in this area of the law: a firm theoretical foundation and clear criteria for resolving disputes involving preferred stock...|$|R

40|$|In {{several recent}} cases, the Delaware Chancery Court has {{emphasized}} that where {{a conflict of}} interest exists between holders of a company’s common stock and holders of its preferred stock, the standard of conduct for directors requires that they strive to maximize the value of the corporation for the benefit of its common stockholders rather than for its <b>preferred</b> <b>stockholders.</b> This article interrogates this view of directors’ fiduciary duties from the perspective of incomplete contracting theory. Building on the seminal work of Sanford Grossman and Oliver Hart, incomplete contracting theory examines the critical role of corporate control rights for addressing conflicts that arise between a firm’s investors so as to maximize firm value. It therefore provides a natural starting point for examining how the control rights residing in a company’s board of directors should be used for resolving conflicts between common and <b>preferred</b> <b>stockholders.</b> This analysis highlights the utility of a default fiduciary duty that prioritizes common stockholder welfare for maximizing the value of the corporation. In particular, such a duty helps facilitate Coasian bargaining among investors to resolve unanticipated conflicts that can arise while also minimizing the risk of bargaining failure. Critically, however, a dictate for directors to maximize stockholder welfare can operate in this fashion only to the extent it exists as a default rule that a director can opt out of when elected to represent the interests of a particular investor or group of investors, as is common among <b>preferred</b> <b>stockholders.</b> Moreover, close inspection of Delaware case law highlights how such a dynamic is consistent with Delaware’s corporate jurisprudence which has historically viewed stockholder wealth maximization as ultimately a means to maximize the value of the corporation. To ensure the continuing vitality of the corporate form, Delaware courts should, accordingly, abandon any pretense that corporate directors have an immutable duty to maximize common stockholder value and revert to their traditional focus on policing against the bargaining failures that can occur when investors use directors to address the incomplete contracting challenges that are replete in corporate finance...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{cross-sectional}} {{analysis of the}} relationship between common stock price reactions to announcements of convertible security calls and variables that represent possible determinants of changes in common stockholders' wealth. The variables are measures of the following effects of convertible security calls: (1) the change in interest expense tax shields, (2) the potential redistribution of wealth from common <b>stockholders</b> to <b>preferred</b> <b>stockholders</b> and debt holders,(3) the decrease in the value of conversion privileges heldby convertible security holders, (4) the relative increase in shares outstanding and (5) the change in earnings per share. A significant relationshipis found only between the measure of the reduction in interest expense tax shields and the stock price response to call announcements. The apparent corporate tax effect is consistent with some combination of effects due to (1) a reduction in interest expense tax shields and (2) unfavorable information about the calling firm's value of earnings prospects that is conveyed by a call of convertible securities. The evidence is consistent with theories of capital structure that imply optimal financial leverage depends on earnings prospects and with theories that imply reductions in leverage convey unfavorable information about firm value. ...|$|R

40|$|Venture capital {{contracts}} are inherently incomplete. When interpreting such contracts, courts {{could deal with}} the expectations of parties formally by inquiring only about the plain meaning of the contract or qualitatively by enforcing the presumed expectations of the parties, regardless of whether those expectations are expressed in the contract. The Delaware courts have opted for a formal approach. In doing so, {{they appear to be}} engaged in an effort to force contracting parties toward completeness. While the duty of good faith appears to respond to the inevitable incompleteness of contracts, the courts largely ignore this duty in preferred stock cases. This omission, coupled with the doctrine of independent legal significance - which treats charter amendments via merger separately from charter amendments via board and stockholder approval - virtually ensures that <b>preferred</b> <b>stockholders</b> will be subject to opportunistic behavior by common stockholders. Whether courts should respond to claims of injustice in this context depends on comparative institutional analysis. Just because market contracting produces incomplete contracts does not mean that courts should be obligated to fill such contracts. On the other hand, this Article suggests that the application of the duty of good faith in this context might provide valuable incentives to renegotiate when unexpected circumstances arise...|$|R

In the report of the committee, it is said that a plan was {{advanced}} for forming the new corporation with capital, of which $1,500,000 was to be preferred stock, and $1,500.000, common. Of the latter amount 11,400 was to be accepted by the holders of the company's notes and debentures in full settlement of their claims on a 40 per cent, basis. The preferred stock was to be an eight per cent, accumulative issue, maturing at the end of five years, and redeemable pro rata at any time during that period at the discretion of the directors, by the payment of ten per cent, per annum, the holders to receive the benefit of the premium, whether the stock ran to maturity or not. In addition, the new company was to acquire all the assets of the Pacific Packing and Navigation Company, and the Pacific American Fisheries Company at receiver's sale. The directors of the company were to consist of five residents of San Francisco, two of Seattle, and two of New York, all of whom were to represent the <b>Preferred</b> <b>Stockholders.</b> Common stockholders had no vote until all the preferred stock has been redeemed.

40|$|This Article {{takes the}} {{occasion}} of the simultaneous collapse of the high technology stock market and the failure of the dot-coin startups, along with the subsequent retrenchment of the venture capital business, to examine the law and economics of downside arrangements in venture capital contracts. The subject matter implicates core concerns of legal and economic theory of the firm. Debates about the separation of ownership and control, relational investing, takeover policy, the law and economics of debt capitalization, and bankruptcy reform, all grapple with the downside problem of controlling and terminating unsuccessful managers for the benefit of outside debt and equity investors (and the related upside problem of incentivizing effective but fallible managers). The factors motivating these debates also bear on venture capital contracting. But venture capital presents a special puzzle for solution. Convertible preferred stock is the dominant financial contract in the venture capital market, at least in the United States. This contrasts with other contexts in corporate finance, where preferred stock is thought to be a financing vehicle long in decline. The only mature firms that finance with preferred, which once was ubiquitous in American capital structures, tend to be firms in regulated industries having little choice in the matter. Tax rules favoring debt finance provide the primary explanation for preferred 2 ̆ 7 s decline. But many corporate law observers would suggest dysfunctional downside contracting as a concomitant cause. Simply, preferred performs badly on the downside, where senior security contracts supposedly are at their most effective. <b>Preferred</b> <b>stockholders</b> routinely have been victimized in distress situations by opportunistic issuers who strip them of their contract rights, transferring value to the junior equity holders who control the firm 2 ̆ 7 s management.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} 2 ̆ 2 speculative leveraging 2 ̆ 2 theory of hostile corporate takeovers in the merger {{wave of the}} 1980 s.

When firms 2 ̆ 7 debt was lower and investment was higher than <b>preferred</b> by <b>stockholders,</b> debt-financed takeovers might create premiums by promising to raise the first and lower the second. ^ Underpinning the speculative leveraging theory is a framework in which financial practices and pricing may be unstable and destabilizing to the real sector of the economy.

Then the institutional and competitive financial market changes of the 1960 s and 1970 s are examined within that theoretical framework, drawing out the dynamics hypothesized to become important in the 1980 s takeover wave. ^ The speculative leveraging theory is specified in a qualitative response raider 2 ̆ 7 s choice model.

Statistical results show that the free cash flow model does not explain takeover status, while the speculative leveraging model does so more strongly as hypothesized, during the 1980 s. ^ These theoretical, historical, and empirical findings suggest that the premiums accompanying 1980 s takeovers should not be assumed to indicate prospective efficiency gains. ...|$|R
40|$|Steel {{manufacturers}} and <b>stockholders</b> <b>prefer</b> bandsawing for cutting off raw materials {{compared to other}} techniques as it enjoys competitive advantages of higher accuracy of cut, better surface finish, lower kerf loss, better straightness of cut, long tool life and high metal removal rate. Along with the geometries of the bandsaw tooth, bandsaw cutting edge condition (e. g., edge sharpness and burr) significantly affects the cutting performance of a bandsaw. Currently the production of bandsaw is largely done by milling operation due to the scale of manufacturing and the economics of milling compared to other processes (e. g., grinding). Ideally, the bandsaw teeth should possess sharp cutting edges with no burr. In general, two types of burr are commonly seen in the bandsaw teeth manufactured by milling operation namely tooth tip burr and side burr. Current research undertaken at Northumbria University in collaboration with a major bandsaw producer {{is focused on the}} mechanism of burr formation in the bandsaw teeth. This paper briefly outlines the factors affecting the burr formation in bimetal (High Speed Steel edge wire and soft steel backing material) bandsaw teeth manufactured by milling process and suggests the necessary steps to be considered for manufacturing burr free bandsaw with sharp cutting edges. The investigation showed that flank wear in the milling cutter has a major influence on the side burr formation in the bandsaw teeth, whereas tooth tip burr was influenced by both flank wear and ''V'' type notch wear found at the crossover point on the flank face. It was also concluded that TiN coating on the milling cutter could control the burr formation in bandsaw teeth to some degree...|$|R
