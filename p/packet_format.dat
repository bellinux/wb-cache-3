50|$|Gnutella2 has an {{extensible}} binary <b>packet</b> <b>format,</b> {{comparable to}} an XML document tree, which was conceived as {{an answer for}} some of gnutella's less elegant parts. The <b>packet</b> <b>format</b> was designed so that future network improvements and individual vendor features could be added without worry of causing bugs in other clients on the network.|$|E
50|$|The Data Streaming {{specification}} supports messaging {{with different}} <b>packet</b> <b>formats</b> and semantics than the Messaging specification. Data Streaming <b>packet</b> <b>formats</b> support {{the transfer of}} up to 64K of data, segmented over multiple packets. Each transfer {{is associated with a}} Class of Service and Stream Identifier, enabling thousands of unique flows between endpoints.|$|R

40|$|A brief {{description}} of the RPCNET architecture is given in the beginning of this manual, then, the protocols and the <b>packet</b> <b>formats</b> of RPCNET are described. More precisely, Chapter 1 deals with a general description of the RPCNET, Chapter 2 deals with the 1 st level protocol (Line and Reconfiguration protocols), Chapter 3 deals with the 2 nd level protocol (End-to-End protocol), and Chapter 4 deals with User-Level protocols, including the description of RNAM, the generalized Access Method supplied by RPCNET. Appendix A is the hardware scheme of the BSC-modified line connection, Appendix B gives an example of how the reconfiguration protocol works, and finally Appendix C describes the <b>packet</b> <b>formats...</b>|$|R
50|$|ATM Operation and Maintenance {{is a set}} of {{protocols}} defining how Asynchronous Transfer Mode interfaces {{can test}} their reliability. Not unlike many other OA&M protocols, ATM OAM relies a predefined <b>packet</b> <b>format</b> for its monitoring functions.|$|E
50|$|The LZMA <b>packet</b> <b>format</b> {{has already}} been described, and this section {{specifies}} how LZMA statistically models the LZ-encoded streams, or in other words which probability variables are passed to the range decoder to decode each bit.|$|E
50|$|Since ARP {{translates}} Layer 3 addresses to Layer 2 addresses, InARP may {{be described}} as its inverse. In addition, InARP is implemented as a protocol extension to ARP: it uses the same <b>packet</b> <b>format</b> as ARP, but different operation codes.|$|E
30|$|Message packet format: it {{specifies}} {{the network}} <b>packets</b> <b>format</b> used to encapsulate application messages. There are two standards {{from which the}} applicationâ€™s designer can choose, the Internet Protocolv 6 (IPv 6) or the WAVE Short Message Protocol (WSMP) [12].|$|R
5000|$|ERT is an OOK {{modulated}} {{radio signal}} which is transmitted in the unlicensed 900-920 MHz band. The message is transmitted {{in the clear}} and uses Manchester encoding. The protocol uses frequency-hopping, a multiple access method to avoid interference with other nearby meters. SCM and IDM <b>packet</b> <b>formats</b> are described in US Patent 7,830,874: ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>packet</b> <b>formats</b> of the Name Service are {{identical}} to DNS. The key differences are {{the addition of}} NetBIOS [...] "Node Status" [...] query, dynamic registration and conflict marking packets. They are encapsulated in UDP. Later implementation includes an optional Scope part of the name, making NetBIOS name hierarchical like DNS, but this is seldom used.|$|R
50|$|Because MTP/IP uses {{proprietary}} algorithms, {{compatible software}} must be installed {{on both ends}} of a communication path. Use of the UDP <b>packet</b> <b>format</b> permits compatibility with standard Internet Protocol (IP) network hardware and software. MTP/IP applications may use any available UDP port number.|$|E

50|$|The NPL {{network was}} later {{interconnected}} with other networks, including the ARPANET in 1973. The NPL network used a line speed of 768 kbit/s in 1967. Influenced by this, the proposed line speed for ARPANET was upgraded from 2.4 kbit/s to 50 kbit/s {{and a similar}} <b>packet</b> <b>format</b> adopted.|$|E
30|$|IEEE 802.11 ac {{is also in}} {{the process}} of {{collecting}} specific proposals and its ratification for MU-MIMO inclusion. In particular, the recently available amendment [18] has proposed some modifications on physical layer convergence protocol (PLCP) header and control <b>packets</b> <b>format.</b> PLCP header will indicate the mode of transmission (SU-MIMO or MU-MIMO) while control packet will indicate the group of receivers selected for MU-MIMO transmission by assigning common group identity. As major modification is required at the MAC layer to smooth operating rules in widen channels during variable network condition, IEEE 802.11 ac is on the process to modify the control <b>packets</b> <b>format</b> on {{such a way that it}} could indicate traffic types, packet length, supported bandwidth, and padding sequences. The very high throughput (VHT) control field will be present in a control wrapper frame and explicit sounding and compressed matrix feedback will be used.|$|R

Designed specifically to plug into IBM PC-AT or compatible computer and to handle {{input and output}} of data in <b>packet</b> <b>formats</b> like those of telemetric data streams used throughout NASA and aerospace industry. Reduces amount of auxiliary equipment needed...|$|R
50|$|PCP was {{standardized}} in 2013 as {{a successor}} to the NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP), sharing similar protocol concepts and <b>packet</b> <b>formats</b> with it. As one of the design differences, NAT-PMP is pretty much limited to the deployment on consumer-grade devices, while PCP is designed to also support carrier-grade equipment. Since 2005, NAT-PMP has been implemented in various Apple products.|$|R
50|$|Alan Johnston {{named the}} {{protocol}} ZRTP because in its earliest Internet drafts {{it was based}} on adding header extensions to RTP packets, which made ZRTP a variant of RTP. In later drafts the <b>packet</b> <b>format</b> changed to make it syntactically distinguishable from RTP. In view of that change, ZRTP is now a pseudo-acronym.|$|E
50|$|UniPro short-header packets use {{a single}} header byte for L3 information. It {{includes}} the 7-bit L3 destination address. The remaining bit indicates the short-header <b>packet</b> <b>format.</b> For short-header packets, the L3 source address {{is not included}} in the header because it is assumed that the two communicating devices have exchanged such information beforehand (connection-oriented communication).|$|E
50|$|Gnutella's <b>packet</b> <b>format</b> {{has been}} criticized {{because it was not}} {{originally}} designed with extensibility in mind, and has had many additions over the years, leaving the packet structure cluttered and inefficient. Gnutella2 learned from this, and aside from having many of the added features of gnutella standard in Gnutella2, designed in future extensibility from the start.|$|E
5000|$|Adaptation layer for {{interoperability}} and packet formats: An adaptation {{mechanism to}} allow interoperability between IPv6 domain and the IEEE 802.15.4 {{can best be}} viewed as a layer problem. Identifying the functionality of this layer and defining newer <b>packet</b> <b>formats,</b> if needed, is an enticing research area. [...] proposes an adaptation layer to allow the transmission of IPv6 datagrams over IEEE 802.15.4 networks.|$|R
5000|$|Currently {{supports}} pcap standard <b>packet</b> capture <b>format,</b> as used by tcpdump, Wireshark, {{and other}} programs.|$|R
50|$|The Flow Control {{specification}} defines <b>packet</b> <b>formats</b> and protocols {{for simple}} XON/XOFF flow control operations. Flow control packets can be originated by switches and endpoints. Reception of a XOFF flow control packet halts transmission of a flow or flows until an XON flow control packet is received or a timeout occurs. Flow Control packets {{can also be}} used as a generic mechanism for managing system resources.|$|R
