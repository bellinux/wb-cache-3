Orbital symptoms frequently precede intracranial spread of the infection [...] Other complications include sinobronchitis, maxillary osteomyelitis, and frontal bone osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis of the frontal bone often originates from a spreading thrombo-phlebitis. A periostitis of the frontal sinus causes an osteitis and a periostitis of the outer membrane, which produces a tender, puffy swelling of the forehead.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: A 44 -year-old man {{developed}} bilateral blindness following severe <b>periorbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> and pansinusitis. CT and MR imaging demonstrated bilateral cavernous sinus thrombosis. Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed reduced apparent {{diffusion coefficient}} in bilateral optic nerves, suggesting optic nerve ischemia {{caused by the}} cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis (CST). Following surgical debridement of pansinusitis, antimicrobial therapy, and anticoagulation, the patient recovered from the infectious episode but sustained permanent bilateral blindness. This case shows that both retinal and optic nerve ischemia can {{be the cause of}} blindness after CST. Arguments supporting an arterial-versus-venous origin for the ischemia are discussed. Septic cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis (CST) is a rareand potentially life-threatening complication of infections involving the sinuses, face, and/or auricular region. 1 It can also occur as a complication of orbital cellulitis, bacterial meningi-tis, subdural empyema, or epidural abscess, as well as rhino-plasty and oral surgery. 1 Before efficacious antimicrobials, the mortality rate of CST was effectively 75 %. 2 With aggressive management, themortality rate is now 30 %, 1, 3 andmorbid...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Ewing's sarcoma is a rare, {{malignant}} tumour predominantly affecting young adolescent males. We describe a unique {{case of an}} isolated extra-skeletal metastasis from a skeletal Ewing's sarcoma primary, arising in the right sinonasal cavity {{of a young man}} who presented with severe epistaxis and <b>periorbital</b> <b>cellulitis.</b> Results: Histologically, the lesion comprised closely packed, slightly diffuse, atypical cells with round, hyperchromatic nuclei, scant cytoplasm and occasional mitotic figures, arranged in a sheet-like pattern. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining only for cluster of differentiation 99 glycoprotein. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation identified the Ewing's sarcoma gene, confirming the diagnosis. Management: Complete surgical resection was achieved via a minimally invasive endoscopic transnasal approach; post-operative radiotherapy. Ten months post-operatively, there were no endoscopic or radiological signs of disease. Conclusion: Metastatic Ewing's sarcoma within the head and neck is incredibly rare and can pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. An awareness of different clinical presentations and distinct histopathological features is important to enable early diagnosis. This case illustrates one potential management strategy, and reinforces the evolving role of endoscopic transnasal approaches in managing sinonasal cavity and anterior skull base tumours. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{examine whether}} {{diabetes}} {{and the degree}} of glycaemic control is associated with an increased risk of acute eye infection, and prescribing of ocular antimicrobial agents. Design and setting: A retrospective cohort study was carried out using the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre database (RCGP RSC), a large primary care database in the United Kingdom. We compared ocular infection rates in people aged ≥ 15 years without diabetes to those with diabetes, both type 1 and type 2. We developed logistic regression models to assess the excess risk in diabetes of: conjunctivitis, blepharitis, stye/chalzion, <b>periorbital</b> <b>cellulitis,</b> keratitis/keratoconjunctivitis, lacrimal gland infection, endopthalmitis, and ocular antimicrobial prescriptions over a six-year period (2010 – 2015).

40|$|Abstract Background Mucormycosis (or zygomycosis) is {{the term}} for {{infection}} caused by fungi of the order Mucorales. Mucoraceae may produce severe disease in susceptible individuals, notably patients with diabetes and leukemia. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis most commonly manifests itself in the setting of poorly controlled diabetes, especially with ketoacidosis. Case Presentation A 31 -year-old diabetic man presented to the outpatient clinic with the following signs and symptoms: headache, periorbital pain, swelling and loss of vision in the right eye. On physical examination his right eye was red and swollen. There was <b>periorbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> and the conjunctiva was edematous. KOH preparation of purulent discharge showed broad, ribbonlike, aseptate hyphae when examined under a fluorescence microscope. Cranial MRI showed involvement of the right orbit, thrombosis in cavernous sinus and infiltrates at ethmoid and maxillary sinuses. Mucormycosis was diagnosed based on these findings. Amphotericin B (AmBisome ®; 2 mg/kg. d) was initiated after the test doses. Right orbitectomy and right partial maxillectomy were performed; the lesions in ethmoid and maxillary sinuses were removed. The duration of the liposomal amphotericin B therapy was approximately 6 months and the total dose of liposomal amphotericin B used was 32 grams. Liposomal amphotericin B therapy was stopped six months later and oral fluconazole was started. Conclusions Although a total surgical debridement of the lesions could not be performed, it is remarkable that regression of the disease could be achieved with medical therapy alone. </p...|$|E
40|$|Cefamandole nafate was {{effective}} {{in the treatment of}} a variety of infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes group A, Streptococcus pneu-moniae, and Haemophilus iniiuenzae in infants and children. The infections included <b>periorbital</b> <b>cellulitis</b> and ethmoiditis, bacteremia, cellulitis, pneumonia, and lymph-adenitis. In vitro, cefamandole {{was effective}} in inhibiting the growth of H. influenzae isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid of patients with meningitis or sepsis. In two patients rash developed and cefamandole was discontinued. Other significant adverse effects were not noted. Cefamandole is a new cephalosporin derivative available in parenteral form as cefamandole na-fate. It is active against a wide range of bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes group A, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and members of the Enterobacteriaceae [1, 2]. Cefa-mandole has greater activity than currently avail-able cephalosporins against Haemophilus influ-enzae. The {{purpose of this study is}} to report the in vivo effect of cefamandole in the treatment of a variety of infections of infants and children.

40|$|We {{described}} the occult bacteremia (OB) and bacteremia with diagnosed focus (BwF) picture among children managed as outpatients at the pediatric emergency room (PER) in southern Israel, {{before and after}} the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) introduction in a retrospective study enrolling all three- to 36 -month-old patients with fever > 38. 0 °C during 2005 – 2014. Of 511 (0. 82 % of all febrile patients) true bacteremias, 230 (45 %) were managed as outpatients; 96 of 230 (41. 7 %) had OB and 134 (3. 59 %) had BwF. OB and BwF rates were 0. 22 % and 3. 02 %, respectively. A significant decrease was noted in OB and BwF rates (p = 0. 0008 and p = 0. 02, respectively). S. pneumoniae (SP, 37. 5 %), K. kingae (11. 4 %) and Brucella spp. (8. 7 %) were the most common OB pathogens and SP (29. 8 %), S. viridans (13. 4 %), and Brucella spp. (12. 7 %) were the most common in BwF patients. PCV 13 serotypes were not found among the serotypes isolated post-PCV 13 introduction. During 2010 – 2014 there was an increase in non-PCV 13 serotype isolation (p = 0. 005).

40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} {{sensitivity}} of an Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) algorithm to detect common skin conditions in children in Fiji. Methods We collected data from the assessments of children aged between 2 months and 5 years who presented {{to one of two}} health clinics. Every child was assessed by a nurse trained {{in the use of the}} IMCI algorithm and also an expert paediatrician. We used a kappa statistic to measure agreement between the nurse/algorithm assessment method and the paediatrician’s diagnosis. Findings High sensitivity for identifying skin problems (sensitivity: 98. 7 %; 95 % confidence interval, CI: 95. 5 – 99. 9) was found for the algorithm applied by IMCI-trained nurses, who were able to identify the one child with a severe skin infection and all three children with <b>periorbital</b> <b>cellulitis.</b> Sensitivity was high for the classification of abscess/cellulitis (sensitivity: 95 %; 95 % CI: 75. 1 – 99. 9) and infected scabies (sensitivity: 89. 1 %; 95 % CI: 77. 8 – 95. 9), but lower for identification of impetigo, fungal infection and, in particular, non-infected scabies. Conclusion The IMCI skin algorithm is a robust tool that should be incorporated into the IMCI after some modifications relating to scabies and impetigo. Its use by primary health-care workers will reduce the burden of skin diseases in children in Fiji through improved case identification and management. The algorithm should be considered in other countries where skin diseases in children are a priority, particularly in the Pacific region.
