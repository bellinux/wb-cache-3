40|$|By {{means of}} a novel {{adaptation}} of the Evelyn <b>photoelectric</b> <b>colorimeter</b> to the measurement of relative turbidities, {{the question of the}} flocculation maximum (F. M.) in acetate buffer solutions of varying pH and salt content has been studied on (a) an exceptionally stable prothrombin-free fibrinogen and its solutions after incipient thermal denaturation and incomplete tryptic proteolysis, (b) plasma, similarly treated, (c) prothrombin, thrombin, and (brain) thromboplastin solutions. All the fibrinogens show a remarkable uniformity of the precipitation pattern, viz. F. M. = 4. 7 (± 0. 2) pH in salt-containing buffer solutions and pH = 5. 3 (± 0. 2) in salt-poor buffer (N/ 100 acetate). The latter approximates the isoelectric point (5. 4) obtained by cataphoresis (14). There is no evidence that denaturation or digestion can produce any "second maximum. " The data support the view that fibrin formation (under the specific influence of thrombin) is intrinsically unrelated to denaturation and digestion phenomena, although all three can proceed simultaneously in crude materials. A criticism is offered, therefore, of Wöhlisch's blood clotting theory. Further applications of the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>colorimeter</b> to coagulation problems are suggested, including kinetic study of fibrin formation and the assay of fibrinogen, with a possible sensitivity of 7. 5 mg. protein in 100 cc. solution...|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} quantitative {{procedure for}} bilirubin of Van den Bergh (1) {{was based upon}} comparison {{of the color of}} an ether extract, first with ferric thiocyanate solutions and later with cobalt sulfate standards. This inaccuracy of standardization has been eliminated by the availa-bility of purified bilirubin in both solid form and in comparatively stable solutions, and by the adaptation of the procedure to spectrophotometers and <b>photoelectric</b> <b>colorimeters,</b> both of which isolate narrow bands of light as compared to the entire spectrum used with visual colorimeters. The second problem was that of precipitation of the proteins by the addition of ethanol in the determination of total bilirubin, accompanied by subsequent loss of some bilirubin by adsorption, and by incomplete dissociation from the assumed protein-bilirubin complex. The solution to this problem was worked out by Malloy and Evelyn (2), who found that the serum proteins did not precipitate in 50 % methanol provided the final protein concentration was below a certain level. At this con-centration of methanol, full color development of the azorubin takes place. The final dilution in the original method was about 1 to 40 or 50, with a protein concentration of 300 - 400 mg. per 100 ml.

40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{the study}} was to study the ability to inhibit urease by some {{pharmaceutical}} compositions that are promising in the prevention of tuberculosis reactivation. In particular, according to a number references sources, quercetin is able to successfully inhibit urease by a non-competitive mechanism. Another compound - dipyrone (metamizol sodium) according to preliminary molecular modeling has a pharmacophore structure similar to urea. Materials and methods. The biochemical studies (urease activity) of some substances effect on urease was carried out. As the leader substances – inhibitors was used quercetin and metamizole, another substances are not shown inhibition activity on the urease. As the substrate a 0. 5 % aqueous urea solution was used. The reaction was carried out at a temperature of 37 ° C, the incubation time was 10 minutes. The activity of urease was determined by the color reaction with the hypochlorite reagent. Photometry was performed on a FEK- 3 M <b>photoelectric</b> <b>colorimeter</b> at a wavelength of 590 nm. Results and discussion. Quercetin and metamizole sodium have the strongest inhibitory properties for urease, since the lowest values of semi-inhibitory concentrations are obtained for them. In the presence of chlorophyllipt, the inhibitory activity of quercetin against urease is not suppressed. Metformin showed no inhibitory activity against urease, and it was low for other substances. Conclusion. The highest anti-urease activity showed a composition based on metamizole sodium and quercetin, a little less - based on quercetin and vitamin D.

40|$|The methods most {{commonly}} employed for {{the estimation of}} blood glucose are dependent upon the ability of glucose to reduce alkaline copper solutions. Reagents containing phosphomolybdic acid are then frequently used to form a blue com-plex by combination with the reduced copper. All these methods suffer the disadvantage that the final colour fades at such a rate as to imperil its accu-rate comparison with a standard glucose solution similarly treated. Fading was neither very apparent nor of much importance when visual colorimeters were em-ployed with direct comparison of standard and unknown colours. Folin (1929) first recorded the existence of fading and described a method to combat it. Interest was aroused by the general adoption of the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>colorimeter,</b> and many technical modifications were introduced to circumvent fading. These were remarkable for their variety rather than for their success in routine use. In the present investigation the factors influenc-ing fading have been determined and a new modifi-cation of the Folin and Wu technique has been evolved which simplifies the standard technique {{at the same time}} as it eliminates fading.

Moisture driven from the sample was collected above the refluxed solvent in a trap inserted between the water-cooled condenser and the sample. In order to avoid limiting the apparatus to location near a water outlet, and for greater ease and speed in handling the condensers, air cooling has since been substituted. A choice of several designs of trap is offered. Boiler-receiver tubes made to fit the Klett-Summerson <b>photoelectric</b> <b>colorimeter</b> provide for the extraction and the development and reading of the colors, {{all in the same}} tubes.

Evidence continues to accumulate that when this drug is administered to patients or experimental animals, the production of thyroid hormone is inhibited, resulting in a fall of the basal oxygen consump-tion, increased activity of the anterior pituitary, and consequent hyperplasia of the thyroid gland. We have also pointed out (1) the importance of knowing more about the pharmacological proper-ties of this drug, particularly the rate of absorp-tion and excretion and its metabolism. For these studies, we found that it was necessary to establish methods for the estimation of this sub-stance in tissues and body fluids. The methods which we found suitable (1) are based on Grote's observation (4) that a color develops when sub-stances of a C =S type are treated with a special sodium nitroferricyanide reagent.

Results {{were compared with}} the determination of “prompt direct reacting bilirubin ” and of total bilirubin by the Ducci-Watson modification of the Malloy-Evelyn method. Comparisons show that the Weber-Schalm method more accurately measures conjugated bilirubin concen#{ 149 } trations in serum in which the bilirubin is mostly conjugated, but that it gives falsely high values for unconjugated bilirubin in serum in which more of the bilirubin is in the unconjugated form. The two methods gave statis-tically identical total bilirubin values for the native serum tested. A method is described for correcting the unduly low values for prompt, direct reacting bilirubin in terms of percentage of conjugated bilirubin. H IJMANS VAN DEN BERGH observed (1,. 2) that some sera react rapidly in aqueous solution (the “direct ” reaction) while others react in this fashiononly afterthe additionofethanol (the“in-direct ” reaction). His observations remained un-explained until the discovery of two chemically different bilirubins during 1950 to 1956 (3 - 9).

The aim of this work was to assess the influence of copper (II) sulphate on intensity of lipid peroxidation (LPO) of Chlorobium limicola IMV K- 8 by measuring the content of primary (conjugated dienes and lipid hydroperoxides) and secondary lipid peroxidation products (TBA-reactive products). Microorganisms were cultivated at a temperature of 28 °C in GSB cultivation medium with exposure to light of wavelength 700 – 800  nm and intensity 40 lux. A suspension of C. limicola ІМV К- 8 cells in the phase of exponential growth was treated for one hour with metal salt solution in concentrations 0. 05 – 0. 50 mM for investigation of the influence of copper (II) sulphate on its physiological and biochemical properties. The control samples did not contain any copper (II) sulphate. Biomass was determined by turbidity of diluted cell suspension by application of <b>photoelectric</b> <b>colorimeter</b> KFK- 3. A mixture of n-heptane and isopropyl alcohol was added into cell-free extract for conjugated dienes determination. The samples were incubated at room temperature and centrifuged. Water was added into the supernatant and the samples were stirred. Ethanol was added to the heptanes phase and adsorption was measured at 233 nm. The content of lipid hydroperoxides was determined by a method based on protein precipitation by trichloroacetic acid followed by addition of ammonium thiocyanate. The concentration of TBA-reactive products in the cell-free extracts was determined by color reaction with malondialdehyde and thiobarbituric acid exposed to high temperature and acidity of the medium, which causes formation of trimetinic adduct with maximal absorption at 532 nm. It was shown that when CuSO 4 was added to the incubation medium the content of conjugated dienes and lipid hydroperoxides increased with the enhancement of salt concentration. However, its value decreased by the seventh and eighth days of cultivation. The content of TBA-reactive products under the influence of copper (II) sulphate varied depending on the duration of cultivation and concentration of the metal. Its highest quantity was observed on the eighth day of cultivation. Thus it was determined that under the influence of CuSO 4 the content of conjugated dienes, lipid hydroperoxides and TBA-reactive products increases. This indicates the increased activity of lipid peroxidation processes and the free radical chain reaction damage mechanism to lipids under these conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} facts {{relating to the}} reaction between phage, sodium penicillin G, and the K race of Staphylococcus aureus are: 1. Except when [P] is very high, massive lysis of the cellular substrate occurs considerably sooner in the P-PN-B mixture than in preparations containing P alone or PN alone. 2. The accelerative effect is present in concentrations of PN varying from 0. 1 to 1 x 104 units/ml. 3. Acceleration of lysis can be secured by exposing staphylococci to PN prior to treatment with P. 4. In certain concentrations of P and B in tryptose-phosphate broth, P formation apparently takes place without bacterial reproduction. The extent to which P is produced is influenced very little by [PN] 0 but is markedly dependent upon [P] 0. With low P/B ratios the [P] curve shows a lag followed by a rapid rise to a peak of 25 to 30 times [P] 0. When the P/B ratio approaches unity there is a considerable primary drop in [P] and later an increase which, however, fails to bring the total P produced above [P] 0. When P/B is still higher, the [P] curve drops profoundly as the bacteria lyse and never enters into a productive phase. 5. In Locke's solution mixtures of P-PN-B, containing 5 to 10 per cent broth, P formation occurs {{in the absence of}} detectable cellular reproduction to the extent of a four- to sixfold increase over [P] 0. 6. Direct microscopic examination of wet preparations removed during the P-PN-B reaction has disclosed swelling of the staphylococci. The swollen cells are three times the diameter of normal S. aureus secured from an 18 hour culture. Cellular swelling apparently accounts for the experimental observation that the curve for lysis plotted from [B]K lags considerably behind the [B]D curve. Increase in the size of individual cells would tend to keep the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>colorimeter</b> measurements high even while the direct count was diminishing. 7. When the P-PN-B reaction is carried out in broth, attainment of the peak in P production is followed by a moderate loss of P. This does not occur when P, PN, and B react in Locke's solution. The reaction dealt with here between P, PN, and S. aureus is similar in a good many respects to that investigated by Price for P, PN, and S. muscae. For example, in both cases P is produced without bacterial reproduction. There are, however, certain noteworthy differences: (a) PN increases the time of half-lysis for S. muscae and lessens it for S. aureus. (b) The yields of P in ranges of [P] and [PN] permitting P formation without bacterial reproduction are higher for S. muscae than for S. aureus. (c) An increase in [PN] from 33 units/ml, to 833 units/ml, greatly reduces the final plaque count secured with S. muscae as a substrate but has no discernible influence on the reaction when S. aureus is used. Currently studies are in progress on the P-PN-B reaction in a synthetic medium in order to obtain information on the mechanism involved...|$|E

On the other hand, fibrinogen remained fairly constant level throughout whole periods of pregnancy, parturition and lactation. 3) Fat, total cholesterol, lecithin and blood sugar concentration in the serum decreased markedly during pregnancy and reached the minimum level at parturition, but thereafter it began to increase. 4) Non-protein nitrogen, urea nitrogen and uric acid concentration in the serum decreased during pregnancy and reached the minimum level at parturition, but thereafter it began to decrease. 5) Chlorine, sodium, potassium, magnecium, calcium and inorganic phosphorus concentration in the serum decreased gradually during pregnancy and reached the minimum level at parturition, but thereafter it began to increase. 6) Alkaline phosphatase concentration in the serum incresed markedly during pregnancy and reached the maximum level at parturition, but thereafter it began to decrease gradually. And these blood componects described above recovered gradually to normal on about 30 - 40 days after parturition. B. The variation of various blood components during development of foetus and infant. 1) The serum moisture concentration decreased gradually during development of foetus and infant. 2) Total plasma protein concentration increased markedly during development of foetus and infant. In the absolute concentration of its protein fractions, albumint, α-and β-globulin increased markedly during development of foetus and infant, but α-globulin of them reached the maximum level on 10 - 20 days after birth and thereafter it began to decrease slightly. γ-globulin began to appear slightly in the serum on 25 days foetal age and it reached the maximum level in newborn, but thereafter it decreased till 20 days after birth and then again increased gradually. On the other hand, fibrinogen remained fairly constant level during development of foetus and infant. 3) Fat, total cholesterol and lecithin concentration in the serum decreased markedly during development of foetus and infant, total cholesterol and lecithin concentration of them reached the minimum the level on 10 days after birth and thereafter it began to increase gradually. 4) Blood sugar concentration in the serum decreased gradually during development of foetus and infant, but it reached the minimum level on 10 days after birth {{and then began to}} increase markedly. 5) Non-protein nitrogen- and amino-acid nitrogen concentration in the serum increased markedly during development of foetus and infant, but amino-acid nitrogen concentration of them reached themaximum level on 5 days after birth and thereafter it began to decrease. On the other hand, uric acid began to appear slightly in the serum on 5 days after birth and its concentration increased gradually during development of infant. 7) Alkaline phosphatase concentration in the serum increased markedly during development of foetus and infant, and it reached the maximum level on 10 days after birth, but thereafter it began to decrease markedly. And these blood components described above reached to the abult level on 2 ～ 3 months after birth. C. The quantitative differences of various components between the maternal and foetal blood. 1) The serum moisture concentration was higher in the foetal than in the maternal serum. 2) Total protein concentration was lower in the foetal thanin the maternal plasma. Albumin, a-and / 3 -globulin concentration were lower in the foetal than in the maternal plasma protein and also Y-globulin concentration lower in the early foetal than in the maternal plasma protein, but it was higher in the foetal at full term than in the maternal plasma protein. There were no significant difference in fibrinogen concentration between the foetal and maternal plasma protein. 3) Fat, total cholesterol and lecithin concentration were higher in the foetal than in the maternal serum. 4) There wereno significant differences in chlorine, sodium, potassium and magnecium concentration between the foetal and maternal sera, but calcium and inorganic phosphorus concentration were always higher in the foetal than in the maternal serum. 5) Blood sugar concentration was slightly lower in the foetal than in the maternal serum. 6) Amino-acid nitrogen concentration was always higher in the foetal than in the maternal serum, whereas non-protein nitrogen and urea nitrogen concentration were lower in the early foetal than in the maternal serum, but they were higher in the foetal at full term than in the maternal serum. 7) Alkaline phosphatase concentration was higher in the foetal than in the maternal serum...|$|E
