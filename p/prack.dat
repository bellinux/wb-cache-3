50|$|Rudolf <b>Prack</b> (2 August 1905 - 2 December 1981) was an Austrian film actor.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1930s he began to be hired more and more for films with regional backgrounds, such The Forester's Daughter (1931) and Hubertus Castle (1934), usually playing huntsmen, foresters or landowners, and often in adaptations of the novels of Ludwig Ganghofer. Thanks to Richter’s deep love of nature, and mountaineering experience, he was able to give such performances a reality that contrasted favorably to Rudolf <b>Prack’s</b> similar performances in the 1950s. [...] At the end of the 1950s, a difficult eye operation ended Richter’s film career.|$|R
