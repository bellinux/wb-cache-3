5|$|As {{early as}} the 1960s, Oak Ridge National Laboratory could produce 650grams of {{promethium}} per year and was the world's only large-volume synthesis facility. Gram-scale production of promethium has been discontinued in the U.S. in the early 1980s, but will <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> resumed after 2010 at the High Flux Isotope Reactor. Currently, Russia {{is the only country}} producing promethium-147 on a relatively large scale.|$|E

5|$|Mixing monosodium {{phosphate}} (NaH2PO4) {{with a solution}} of actinium in hydrochloric acid yields white-colored actinium phosphate hemihydrate (AcPO4·0.5H2O), and heating actinium oxalate with hydrogen sulfide vapors at 1400°C {{for a few minutes}} results in a black actinium sulfide Ac2S3. It may <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> produced by acting with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide on actinium oxide at 1000°C.|$|E

Ayanokoji tachi are slender with small kissaki. The jihada uses soft jigane, small mokume-hada mixed with masame-hada, {{abundant}} ji-nie, yubashiri and chikei.

In 2012 a fossil bumblebee, Bombus (Bombus) randeckensis was described from the Miocene Randeck Maar in southwestern Germany and confidently placed in the subgenus Bombus.|$|E
5|$|When President Kennedy first {{chartered}} the Moon landing program, {{a preliminary}} cost estimate of $7 billion was generated, but this proved an extremely unrealistic guess {{of what could}} not <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> determined precisely, and James Webb used his judgment as administrator to change the estimate to $20 billion before giving it to Vice President Johnson.|$|E

5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end, at Ysgwrfa, the final five locks before Glynneath have been severed by a realignment {{of the road}} and the construction of a culvert, but the road has carried a lot less traffic since the A465 bypass was opened, and could <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> rerouted along its original course, where the bridge over the canal still exists. The Neath Canal Act has not been repealed, and so there is still a right of navigation along this section, which should ease the process of reinstating it. The terminus would then be near the Lamb and Flag public house, south of the final two locks, which are unlikely to be restored.|$|E
5|$|By 11,000 BC, {{the makers}} of the long blades had gone. Two timber {{platforms}} have been identified within the peat at Titchwell, and may <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> rare Bronze Age (2,500–800BCE) survivals. Seahenge is another early Bronze Age site found on the coast at Holme in 1998. It consists of a ring of 55 oak posts and was built in 2049BC; a similar nearby structure, Holme II, may be almost two centuries older. A large Iron Age fort at Holkham enclosed 2.5ha (6.1acres) {{at the end of}} a sandy spit in what was then salt marsh, and remained in use until the defeat of the Iceni in 47AD.|$|E

5|$|Early genetic {{studies were}} focused on lions from eastern and {{southern}} parts of Africa, and already showed that lions can <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> divided in two main clades: one {{to the west of}} the Great Rift Valley and the other to the east.

5|$|From {{his later}} {{marriage}} to Matasuntha, {{he had a}} son, also called Germanus, born posthumously (late 550/early 551). Nothing further is known of him with certainty, although he can <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> identified with the patricius Germanus, a leading senator in the reign of Emperor Maurice (r. 582–602) whose daughter married Maurice's eldest son Theodosius. Michael Whitby identifies the younger Germanus with Germanus, a son-in-law of Tiberius II Constantine and Ino Anastasia.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} sinkhole's collapse, there were plans {{to fill it}} in with a soil cement made from cement, limestone, and water known locally as lodocreto ("mudcrete"). This {{substance}} was also used {{to fill in the}} 2007 Guatemala City sinkhole. However, another technique, which geologists call the graded-filter technique, in which the sinkhole is filled with successive layers of boulders, smaller rocks, and gravel, could <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> a better solution. This is because filling the hole in with cement diverts water runoff to other areas, potentially increasing the risk of sinkholes occurring {{in other parts of the}} city. The graded-filter technique, on the other hand, allows water to seep through.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Sega {{noted that}} the game was {{frequently}} requested by fans as a title for re-release. The company {{has been criticized for}} their reluctance to do so; 1UP.com and Hardcore Gamer 101 felt Sonic Gems Collection (2005) to be incomplete as it lacked the title. In 2010, the head of Sonic Team, Takashi Iizuka, expressed interest in developing a sequel to the game. Also taking an interest was Christian Whitehead, the developer of the 2011 remaster of Sonic CD, who said in a 2014 interview that he would <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> open to remaking the game using the Retro Engine.|$|E
5|$|On Jupiter, cirrus {{clouds are}} {{composed}} of ammonia. When Jupiter's South Equatorial Belt disappeared, one hypothesis put forward by Glenn Orten was that a large quantity of ammonia cirrus clouds had formed above it, hiding it from view. NASA's Cassini probe detected these clouds on Saturn and thin water-ice cirrus on Saturn's moon Titan. Cirrus clouds composed of methane ice exist on Uranus. On Neptune, thin wispy clouds which could <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> cirrus have been detected over the Great Dark Spot. As on Uranus, these are probably methane crystals.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{damage was}} done to the church in 1400 during the {{rebellion}} of Owain Glyndŵr; his forces also destroyed the Bishop's Palace at Llandaff. The damage was extensive enough to cause Bishop Blethyn to notify his fellow clergymen in 1575 that he believed the cathedral to <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> damaged beyond repair. Most of the other damage was repaired, most notably by Bishop Marshall, whose reredos partly survives. The northwest tower, the one without a spire, was added by Jasper Tudor and is now named after him. He assumed the lordship of Cardiff after the accession to the throne of his nephew, King Henry VII of England.|$|E
