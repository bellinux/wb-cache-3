5|$|When {{made with}} chickpeas, falafel {{is high in}} protein, complex carbohydrates, and fiber. Key {{nutrients}} are calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, copper, manganese, vitamin C, thiamine, <b>pantothenic</b> acid, vitamin B, and folate. Phytochemicals include beta-carotene. Falafel is high in soluble fiber, which {{has been shown to}} be effective in lowering blood cholesterol.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Chicago, Morgan held brief teaching appointments at smaller schools before earning a doctorate and taking the position at Berkeley. Morgan's lab conducted significant research into the nutritional composition of foods and the biochemistry of vitamins, especially <b>pantothenic</b> acid (vitamin B5). Her work correlated decreasing bone density with increasing age and connected serum cholesterol levels with dietary fat intake.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} scientific research to emerge from Morgan's laboratory concerned the biochemistry of vitamins and the nutritional value of foods. She became best known for her work examining the effects of <b>pantothenic</b> acid (vitamin B5) on adrenal gland function. In her early research work, Morgan analyzed processed foods and characterized their vitamin composition. She was the first to establish that a preservative, sulfur dioxide, protected vitamin C but damaged thiamine.|$|E
5|$|Some non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} are {{not found in}} proteins. Examples include 2-aminoisobutyric acid and the {{neurotransmitter}} gamma-aminobutyric acid. Non-proteinogenic amino acids often occur as intermediates in the metabolic pathways for standard amino acids– for example, ornithine and citrulline occur in the urea cycle, part of amino acid catabolism (see below). A rare exception to the dominance of α-amino acids in biology is the β-amino acid beta alanine (3-aminopropanoic acid), which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of <b>pantothenic</b> acid (vitamin B5), a component of coenzyme A.|$|E
5|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, <b>pantothenic</b> acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pantothenic</b> acid, {{also called}} vitamin B5 (a B vitamin), is a {{water-soluble}} vitamin. <b>Pantothenic</b> acid {{is an essential}} nutrient. Animals require <b>pantothenic</b> acid to synthesize coenzyme-A (CoA), {{as well as to}} synthesize and metabolize proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. The anion is called pantothenate.|$|E
25|$|Since <b>pantothenic</b> acid {{participates in}} {{a wide array of}} key {{biological}} roles, it is essential to all forms of life. As such, deficiencies in <b>pantothenic</b> acid may have numerous wide-ranging effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pantothenic</b> acid was {{discovered}} by Roger J. Williams in 1933.|$|E
25|$|Only the {{dextrorotatory}} (D) isomer of <b>pantothenic</b> acid possesses biologic activity. The levorotatory (L) form may antagonize {{the effects}} of the dextrorotatory isomer.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>pantothenic</b> acid supplementation {{is under}} {{preliminary}} research {{for a variety}} of human diseases, there is insufficient evidence to date that it has any effect.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pantothenic</b> acid in {{the form}} of CoA is also {{required}} for acylation and acetylation, which, for example, are involved in signal transduction and enzyme activation and deactivation, respectively.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pantothenic</b> acid– {{involved}} in the metabolism of sugars and lipids. A deficiency of this vitamin could lead into increase hydrogen sulfide production with off-aromas in the resulting wine.|$|E
25|$|Peanut {{butter is}} a rich source (20% {{or more of the}} Daily Value, DV) of dietary fiber, vitamin E, <b>pantothenic</b> acid, niacin, and vitamin B6 (table, USDA National Nutrient Database). Also high in content are the dietary {{minerals}} manganese, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, and copper (table). Peanut butter is a moderate source (10–19% DV) of thiamin, iron, and potassium (table).|$|E
25|$|Certain {{alcoholic}} beverages can also contain congeners that {{may also be}} bioactive; therefore, the consumption of varying {{alcoholic beverages}} may result in different health consequences. An individual’s nutritional intake also {{plays a role in}} the development of this disease. Depending on the specific dietary habits, they may have a deficiency of one or more of the following: thiamine (vitamin B1), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), <b>pantothenic</b> acid and biotin, vitamin B12, folic acid, niacin (vitamin B3), and vitamin A.|$|E
25|$|Raw brown {{mushrooms}} are 92% water, 4% carbohydrates, 2% protein {{and less than}} 1% fat. In a 100 gram (3.5 ounce) amount, raw mushrooms provide 22 calories and are a rich source (20% {{or more of the}} Daily Value, DV) of B vitamins, such as riboflavin, niacin and <b>pantothenic</b> acid, selenium (37% DV) and copper (25% DV), and a moderate source (10-19% DV) of phosphorus, zinc and potassium (table). Vitamin C and sodium have no or minimal content.|$|E
25|$|Raw, yellow, sweet maize kernels are {{composed}} of 76% water, 19% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and 1% fat (table). In a 100-gram serving, maize kernels provide 86 calories and are a good source (10-19% of the Daily Value) of the B vitamins, thiamin, niacin, <b>pantothenic</b> acid (B5) and folate (right table for raw, uncooked kernels, USDA Nutrient Database). In moderate amounts, they also supply dietary fiber and the essential minerals, magnesium and phosphorus whereas other nutrients are in low amounts (table).|$|E
25|$|For U.S. {{food and}} dietary {{supplement}} labeling purposes {{the amount in}} a serving is expressed {{as a percent of}} Daily Value (%DV). For <b>pantothenic</b> acid labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 10 mg, but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 5 mg to bring it into agreement with the AI. A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. Food and supplement companies have until January 1, 2020 to comply with the change.|$|E
25|$|In {{the typical}} serving size of 1–3 cloves (3–9 grams), garlic {{provides}} no significant nutritional value, with {{the content of}} all essential nutrients below 10% of the Daily Value (DV) (table). When expressed per 100 grams, garlic contains several nutrients in rich amounts (20% {{or more of the}} DV), including vitamins B6 and C, and the dietary minerals, manganese and phosphorus. Per 100 gram serving, garlic is also a moderate source (10–19% DV) of certain B vitamins, including thiamin and <b>pantothenic</b> acid, as well as the dietary minerals, calcium, iron, and zinc (table).|$|E
25|$|Minerals or milk salts, are {{traditional}} names {{for a variety}} of cations and anions within bovine milk. Calcium, phosphate, magnesium, sodium, potassium, citrate, and chlorine are all included as minerals and they typically occur at concentration of 5–40 mM. The milk salts strongly interact with casein, most notably calcium phosphate. It is present in excess and often, much greater excess of solubility of solid calcium phosphate. In addition to calcium, milk is a good source of many other vitamins. Vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, K, E, thiamine, niacin, biotin, riboflavin, folates, and <b>pantothenic</b> acid are all present in milk.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pantothenic</b> acid {{is used in}} the {{synthesis}} of coenzyme A (CoA). Coenzyme A may act as an acyl group carrier to form acetyl-CoA and other related compounds; {{this is a way to}} transport carbon atoms within the cell. CoA is important in energy metabolism for pyruvate to enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) as acetyl-CoA, and for α-ketoglutarate to be transformed to succinyl-CoA in the cycle. CoA is also important in the biosynthesis of many important compounds such as fatty acids, cholesterol, and acetylcholine. CoA is incidentally also required in the formation of ACP, which is also required for fatty acid synthesis in addition to CoA.|$|E
25|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{refers to}} the {{collective}} set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined {{the same as in}} United States. For women and men over age 11 the Adequate Intake (AI) is set at 5 mg/day. AI for pregnancy is 5 mg/day, for lactation 7 mg/day. For children ages 1–10 years the AI is 4 mg/day. These AIs are similar to the U.S. AIs. The EFSA also reviewed the safety question and reached the same conclusion as in United States - that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL for <b>pantothenic</b> acid.|$|E
2500|$|No dietary {{requirement}} for <b>pantothenic</b> acid {{has been established}} as synthesis of <b>pantothenic</b> acid by ruminal microorganisms appears to be 20 to 30 times more than dietary amounts. [...] Net microbial synthesis of <b>pantothenic</b> acid in the rumen of steer calves has been estimated to be 2.2mg/kg of digestible organic matter consumed per day. [...] The degradation of dietary intake of <b>pantothenic</b> acid {{is considered to be}} 78 percent. [...] Supplementation of <b>pantothenic</b> acid at 5 to 10 times theoretic requirements did not improve performance of feedlot cattle ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{found in}} foods, most <b>pantothenic</b> acid {{is in the}} form of CoA or acyl carrier protein (ACP). [...] For the {{intestinal}} cells to absorb this vitamin, it must be converted into free <b>pantothenic</b> acid. [...] Within the lumen of the intestine, CoA and ACP are hydrolyzed into 4'-phosphopantetheine. [...] The 4'-phosphopantetheine is then dephosphorylated into pantetheine. [...] Pantetheinase, an intestinal enzyme, then hydrolyzes pantetheine into free <b>pantothenic</b> acid.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pantothenic</b> acid {{deficiency}} is exceptionally {{rare and}} has not been thoroughly studied. [...] In the few cases where deficiency has been seen (victims of starvation and limited volunteer trials), nearly all symptoms can be reversed with the return of <b>pantothenic</b> acid.|$|E
2500|$|Content of <b>pantothenic</b> acid varies among {{manufactured}} {{and natural}} foods, especially fortified ready-to-eat cereals, [...] infant formulas, energy bars and dried foods. [...] Major food sources of <b>pantothenic</b> acid are dried mushrooms, liver, {{dried egg yolks}} and sunflower seeds. Whole grains are another source of the vitamin, but milling removes much of the <b>pantothenic</b> acid, as it {{is found in the}} outer layers of whole grains. In animal feeds, the most important sources are alfalfa, cereal, fish meal, peanut meal, molasses, mushrooms, rice, wheat bran, and yeasts.|$|E
2500|$|Free <b>pantothenic</b> acid {{is absorbed}} into {{intestinal}} cells via a saturable, sodium-dependent active transport system. [...] At {{high levels of}} intake, when this mechanism is saturated, some <b>pantothenic</b> acid may also be absorbed via passive diffusion. As intake increases 10-fold, however, absorption rate decreases to 10%.|$|E
2500|$|The {{derivative}} of <b>pantothenic</b> acid, pantothenol (panthenol), {{is a more}} stable form of the vitamin and is often used {{as a source of}} the vitamin in multivitamin supplements. [...] Another common supplemental form of the vitamin is calcium pantothenate. [...] Calcium pantothenate is often used in dietary supplements because, as a salt, it is more stable than <b>pantothenic</b> acid.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pantothenic</b> acid is the amide between pantoic {{acid and}} β-alanine. Its name {{derives from the}} Greek pantothen, meaning [...] "from everywhere", and small {{quantities}} of <b>pantothenic</b> acid are found in nearly every food, with high amounts in fortified whole-grain cereals, egg yolks, liver and dried mushrooms. [...] It is commonly found as its alcohol analog, the provitamin panthenol (pantothenol), and as calcium pantothenate.|$|E

2500|$|Toxicity of <b>pantothenic</b> acid is unlikely. [...] In fact, no Tolerable Upper Level Intake (UL) {{has been}} established. Large {{doses of the}} vitamin, when ingested, have no {{reported}} side effects and massive doses (e.g., 10g/day) may only yield mild intestinal distress, and diarrhea at worst. There are also no adverse reactions known following parenteral (injected) or topical (skin) applications of the vitamin. <b>Pantothenic</b> acid, in an animal study, was shown to induce adrenal hyper-responsiveness to stress stimulation.|$|E
2500|$|In a 100-gram serving, raw white {{mushrooms}} provide [...] of {{food energy}} and {{are an excellent}} source (> 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of the B vitamins, riboflavin, niacin, and <b>pantothenic</b> acid (table). Fresh mushrooms are also a good source (10–19% DV) of the dietary mineral phosphorus (table).|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{introduction}} of complex nutritional supplements and advances in freeze-dried cultures of LAB, winemakers would cultivate their inoculum of lactic acid bacteria from culture slants provided by laboratories. In the 1960s, these winemakers {{found it easier to}} create starter cultures in media that contained apple or tomato juice. This [...] "tomato juice factor" [...] was discovered to be a derivative of <b>pantothenic</b> acid, an important growth factor for the bacteria.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for B {{vitamins}} in 1998. At {{that time}} there was not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs for <b>pantothenic</b> acid. In instances such as this, the Board sets Adequate Intakes (AIs), {{with the understanding that}} at some later date, AIs will be replaced by more exact information. The current AI for teens and adults ages 14 and up is 5 mg/day. AI for pregnancy is 6 mg/day. AI for lactation is 7 mg/day. For infants up to 12 months the AI is 1.8 mg/day. For children ages 1–13 years the AI increases with age from 2 to 4 μg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of <b>pantothenic</b> acid there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).|$|E
2500|$|Symptoms of {{deficiency}} {{are similar}} to other vitamin B deficiencies. [...] There is impaired energy production, due to low CoA levels, which could cause symptoms of irritability, fatigue, and apathy. Acetylcholine synthesis is also impaired; therefore, neurological symptoms can also appear in deficiency; they include numbness, paresthesia, and muscle cramps. [...] Deficiency in <b>pantothenic</b> acid can also cause hypoglycemia, or an increased sensitivity to insulin. [...] Insulin receptors are acylated with palmitic acid {{when they do not}} want to bind with insulin. [...] Therefore, more insulin will bind to receptors when acylation decreases, causing hypoglycemia. [...] Additional symptoms could include restlessness, malaise, sleep disturbances, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. [...] In a few rare circumstances, more serious (but reversible) conditions have been seen, such as adrenal insufficiency and hepatic encephalopathy.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the absence}} of nitrogen, yeast will begin to shut down and die off. Some strains will begin {{breaking}} down sulfur containing amino acids like cysteine and methionine releasing a sulfur atom that can combine with hydrogen to produce hydrogen sulfide (...) which can impart rotten egg odors to the wine. However, {{there is not a}} direct correlation between YAN levels and hydrogen sulfide production since H2S can be produced by yeast even in the presence of abundant nitrogen but with instead other vital nutrients (such as the vitamin <b>pantothenic</b> acid) lacking. There are even some strains of S. cerevisiae that produce H2S as a response to having too much available nitrogen (particularly too much glutamic acid and alanine). This is why a prophylactic approach of indiscriminately adding nitrogen supplementation to every fermentation may not have the desired results of preventing H2S.|$|E
2500|$|Primary {{metabolite}} enzymatic cofactors include {{members of}} the vitamin B family. Vitamin B1 as thiamine diphosphate is a coenzyme for pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase which are all involved in carbohydrate metabolism. [...] Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is a constituent of FMN and FAD which are necessary for many redox reactions. [...] Vitamin B3 (nicotinic acid or niacin), synthesized from tryptophan is {{a component of the}} coenzymes NAD and NADP which in turn are required for electron transport in the Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, as well as many other redox reactions. Vitamin B5 (<b>pantothenic</b> acid) is a constituent of coenzyme A, a basic component of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism as well as the biosynthesis of fatty acids and polyketides. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxol, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine) as pyridoxal 5′-phosphate is a cofactor for many enzymes especially transaminases involve in amino acid metabolism. Vitamin B12 (cobalamins) contain a corrin ring similar in structure to porphyrin and is an essential coenzyme for the catabolism of fatty acids as well for the biosynthesis of methionine.|$|E
