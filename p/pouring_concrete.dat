This {{involved}} a massive {{conversion of the}} theater including <b>pouring</b> <b>concrete</b> ramps into the seating area. When the show closed, the theater was used to film The Oak Ridge Boys Live series for TNN before it was gutted and renovated.|$|E
25|$|Following Gacy's {{marriage}} to Carole Hoff, {{his new wife}} and stepdaughters moved into the Summerdale Avenue house. Gacy had quit {{his job as a}} cook and started his own construction business, PDM Contractors (PDM being the initials for 'Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance'). The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, <b>pouring</b> <b>concrete</b> and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, remodeling, installation, assembly, and landscaping. By 1978, the gross of PDM's annual turnover was over $200,000.|$|E

25|$|As {{far back}} as 2001, Turnpike Authority {{officials}} and contractors knew of thousands of leaks in ceiling and wall fissures, extensive water damage to steel supports and fireproofing systems, and overloaded drainage systems. A $10 million contract, signed off as a cost overrun, was used to repair these leaks. Many of the leaks were a result of Modern Continental and other subcontractors failing to remove gravel and other debris before <b>pouring</b> <b>concrete.</b> This information was not made public; engineers at MIT (volunteer students and professors) performed several experiments and found serious problems with the tunnel.|$|E

2500|$|Corrosion inhibitors, such as calcium nitrite , {{can also}} {{be added to the}} water mix before <b>pouring</b> <b>concrete.</b> Generally, 1–2wt.% of [...] with respect to cement weight is needed to prevent {{corrosion}} of the rebars. The nitrite anion is a mild oxidizer that oxidizes the soluble and mobile ferrous ions (Fe2+) present at the surface of the corroding steel and causes them to precipitate as an insoluble ferric hydroxide (Fe(OH)3). This causes the passivation of steel at the anodic oxidation sites. Nitrite is a much more active corrosion inhibitor than nitrate, which is a less powerful oxidizer of the divalent iron.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the space}} {{limitations}} around the construction site - the site is situated {{on one of the}} busiest transport arteries of Istanbul, Buyukdere Avenue - and to minimize the impact of construction activities on the traffic, all <b>concrete</b> <b>pouring</b> activities using <b>concrete</b> mixer trucks are performed at night.|$|R

2500|$|The {{recommendation}} {{to establish a}} lighthouse on North Reef was made by a select parliamentary committee in 1864. The site was then a small sandbank on a coral reef. The proposal called for a cast iron cylindrical tower, [...] in diameter and [...] tall, which would rest on the coral, penetrating the sand. A hollow base would be formed by <b>pouring</b> <b>concrete</b> into the cylinder, which would {{also serve as a}} fresh water tank, and the residence will surround it. Tenders were called in January 1876, and the winning offer was for £7,964 by Walker and Company of Maryborough. Construction was to be completed in by July 1877 but delays, first in approval of the money and then in construction, delayed the completion until November 1878.|$|E
2500|$|Thos. S. Byrne, Ltd. was the {{contractor}} for the project, with A. T. Seymour as project manager. [...] Virgil Earp and L. G. Shaw, Byrne's project superintendents, designed forms with a cycloid shape {{that were made}} from hinged plywood and lined with an oily coating {{so they could be}} reused to pour concrete for multiple sections of the vaults, helping to ensure consistency. [...] The long, straight channels at the bottoms of the shells were cast first so they could be used as platforms to support the workmen <b>pouring</b> <b>concrete</b> for the cycloid curves. [...] After all the concrete had been poured and strengthened with internal post-tensioning cables, however, the curved parts of the shells carried the weight of their lower straight edges instead of the other way around.|$|E
2500|$|Building of the dam's main {{concrete}} structure started in July 1940 after the cable systems {{had been completed}} and the mixing plant came on line. Steel buckets capable of carrying [...] of concrete, weighing 16 tonnes when full, traveled back and forth along the lines. For three years, thousands of men labored building the dam's massive abutments, <b>pouring</b> <b>concrete</b> into large modular [...] "blocks" [...] square and [...] deep. These blocks were shaped using wooden forms, which were removed when the concrete dried and rebuilt to handle the next block above it. The concrete was [...] "vibrated" [...] into place using specialized equipment, filling in any accidental cavities and bubbles to ensure maximum density and strength. After the concrete dried, the surface was cleaned and smoothed by sandblasting. At the same time, the railroad that ran through the temporary [...] tunnel {{on the west side}} of the river was rerouted.|$|E

40|$|Construction labor {{productivity}} variations are {{the results}} of several factors. However most of the productivity models developed address only {{the effect of a}} single factor. There are a few models, limited to masonry construction, in which multiple factors are considered. Regression analysis has been the common tool used in productivity studies, but in recent years neural networks have been a successful alternative for problems similar to construction labor productivity modeling. This study involved development of multivariate productivity models for <b>concrete</b> <b>pouring,</b> formwork, <b>concrete</b> finishing, and granular fill. A large sample was obtained from eight projects of a building contractor. Several neural network and regression models were compared. Modeling approaches, and results of the models were discussed...|$|R
