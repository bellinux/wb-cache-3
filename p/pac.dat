5|$|When clocked, {{the phase}} {{accumulator}} (PA) creates a modulo-2N sawtooth waveform {{which is then}} converted by the phase-to-amplitude converter (<b>PAC)</b> to a sampled sinusoid, where N {{is the number of}} bits carried in the phase accumulator. N sets the NCO frequency resolution and is normally much larger than the number of bits defining the memory space of the <b>PAC</b> look-up table. If the <b>PAC</b> capacity is 2M, the PA output word must be truncated to M bits as shown in Figure 1. However, the truncated bits can be used for interpolation. The truncation of the phase output word does not affect the frequency accuracy but produces a time-varying periodic phase error which is a primary source of spurious products. Another spurious product generation mechanism is finite word length effects of the <b>PAC</b> output (amplitude) word.|$|E

40|$|Chiral {{pharmacologically}} active compounds (<b>PACs)</b> are environmental pollutants. They {{enter the}} environment mainly through insufficiently treated sewage, waste effluents from manufacturing processes, runoff and sludge. They are bioactive, ubiquitous and persistent with synergistic properties. Surprisingly, the environmental fate {{and effects of}} <b>PACs</b> are assessed without taking into consideration their enantiomeric forms (this is despite existing knowledge on enantiomer dependant toxicity of <b>PACs</b> to humans, taking thalidomide as a flagship example). Such an approach leads to an underestimation of toxicity of <b>PACs,</b> incorrect environmental risk assessment, and direct risk {{to the environment and}} human health, as <b>PACs</b> are likely to be present in the environment in their non-racemic forms(in the case of single enantiomer <b>PACs</b> racemisation in-vivo can also take place).

Moreover, the numbers of donors and dollars contributed to sponsored <b>PACs</b> aggregated by congressional district during 1996 - 2006 are relatively unaffected by electoral competi-tion, presidential cycles, or changes in campaign finance regulations, and the effects of urbanization are less uniform than for nonconnected <b>PACs.</b> <b>PACs</b> sponsored by economic institutions therefore expand the pool of donors beyond the usual suspects...|$|R

50|$|Premature atrial contractions (<b>PACs),</b> {{also known}} as atrial {{premature}} complexes (APC) or atrial premature beats (APB), are a common cardiac dysrhythmia characterized by premature heartbeats originating in the atria. While the sinoatrial node typically regulates the heartbeat during normal sinus rhythm, <b>PACs</b> occur when another region of the atria depolarizes before the sinoatrial node and thus triggers a premature heartbeat. The exact cause of <b>PACs</b> is unclear; while several predisposing conditions exist, <b>PACs</b> commonly occur in healthy young and elderly people. Elderly people that get <b>PACs</b> usually don't need any further attention besides follow ups due to unclear evidence. <b>PACs</b> are often completely asymptomatic and may be noted only with Holter monitoring, but occasionally they can {{be perceived as a}} skipped beat or a jolt in the chest. In most cases, no treatment other than reassurance is needed for <b>PACs,</b> although medications such as beta blockers can reduce the frequency of symptomatic <b>PACs.</b>|$|R

Thousands of <b>PACs</b> are approved for human/veterinary use, although {{only a very}} small percentage of these compounds have been studied in the environment. Some of the most commonly used <b>PACs</b> are sold in hundreds of tonnes/year in the UK alone. <b>PACs</b> enter the environment mainly through insufficiently treated sewage, waste effluents from manufacturing processes, runoff and sludge (if used as fertiliser or transported to landfill). They are ubiquitous and persistent (due to their continuous introduction into the environment) with synergistic properties. <b>PACs</b> have also been detected in drinking water, which poses a direct risk to humans and raises the issue of contaminated water sources. The necessity of research into <b>PACs</b> is widely acknowledged and the need for action to further improve our understanding of risks posed by <b>PACs</b> is often highlighted. The aim of this presentation is to discuss efficiency of different wastewater treatment processes in the removal of <b>PACs</b> and to raise awareness of two important but underreported issues relating to the presence and fate of <b>PACs</b> in wastewater and their ecotoxicity. These are: (i) the possibility of under-reporting of the measured concentrations of certain <b>PACs</b> due to lack of routine measurement of these compounds in solids and (ii) possibility of a significant under or overestimation of toxicity of chiral <b>PACs</b> and incorrect environmental risk assessment due to lack of data on enantiomer-specific fate of these compounds during wastewater treatment and in the environment...|$|R
40|$|Stability of {{polycyclic}} aromatic compounds (<b>PACs)</b> in {{polyurethane foam}} (PUF) disks upon O- 3 exposure was studied in a flow tube. A wide range of <b>PACs</b> was evaluated by spiking PUF disks with <b>PACs</b> and exposing to O- 3 at concentrations that were equivalent to two months exposure, a typical deployment period for these passive air samplers. Ambient concentrations of O- 3 (similar to 50 ppb) at 0 % and 50 % relative humidity (RH) were applied. At 0 % RH, 23 of 68 <b>PACs</b> yielded more than 50 % loss after exposure. The mean percent loss was 30 % with perylene and 9, 10 -dimethylanthracene the most reactive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and alkylated PAHs, respectively. At 50 % RH, 77 % of the studied <b>PACs</b> was stable upon O- 3 exposure (PAC(exposed) /PAC(unexposed) > 0. 7). The mean percent loss was 17 % and only 7 of 68 <b>PACs</b> yielded greater than 50 % loss. In general, the reactivity {{of most of the}} <b>PACs</b> decreased at higher RH, except for the reactive PAHs (acenaphthylene, 2, 3 -dimethylanthracene, 9, 10 -dimethylanthracene, dibenzothiophene, and 2 -methyldibenzothiophene) which demonstrated lower RH dependence. The experimental conditions in this study represent a worst case scenario for the stability of <b>PACs</b> sorbed to PUF. In reality, the sampling of <b>PACs</b> in ambient air represents an &# 39;aged&# 39; component of <b>PACs</b> where the most reactive species have already partially been removed. Also, <b>PACs</b> in ambient air will be associated with the particle phase to varying extents that will help to enhance their stability. Therefore, under regular operating conditions, over a 2 -month exposure, we expect a minimal error in the measurement of total concentration of <b>PACs</b> in air using the PUF disk passive sampler.

The effects work consisted mainly of peripheral additions: architecture, vehicles, crowds and furniture. CIS used 3D modeling package Maya to animate city scenes before rendering them in mental ray; they generated matte paintings in Softimage XSI and Maya, and used Digital Fusion for some 2D shots. The team's work began with research into 1928 Los Angeles; they referenced historical photographs and data on the urban core's population density. CIS had to generate mostly new computer models, textures and motion capture because the company's existing effects catalog consisted primarily of modern era elements. CIS supplemented exteriors with skylines and detailed backdrops. They created set extensions digitally and with matte paintings. CIS created city blocks by using shared elements of period architecture that could be combined, rearranged and restacked to make buildings of different widths and heights; that way, the city could look diverse {{with a minimum of}} textural variation. CIS referenced vintage aerial photographs of downtown Los Angeles so shots would better reflect the geography of the city, as Hancock felt it important to have a consistency that would allow audiences to understand and become immersed in the environment.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Type 2 {{diabetes}} (T 2 D) {{is associated}} with reduction and dysfunction of circulating pro-angiogenic cells (<b>PACs).</b> DPP- 4 inhibitors, a class of oral agents for T 2 D, might possess pleiotropic vasculoprotective activities. Herein, we tested whether DPP- 4 inhibition with Saxagliptin affects the function of circulating <b>PACs</b> from T 2 D and healthy subjects. METHODS: <b>PACs</b> were isolated from T 2 D (n[*]=[*] 20) and healthy (n[*]=[*] 20) subjects. Gene expression, clonogenesis, proliferation, adhesion, migration and tubulisation were assessed in vitro by incubating <b>PACs</b> with or without Saxagliptin and SDF- 1 α. Stimulation of angiogenesis by circulating cells from T 2 D patients treated with Saxagliptin or other non-incretinergic drugs was assessed in vivo using animal models. RESULTS: Soluble DPP- 4 activity was predominant over cellular activity and was successfully inhibited by Saxagliptin. At baseline, T 2 D compared to healthy <b>PACs</b> contained less acLDL+Lectin+ cells, and showed altered expression of genes related to adhesion and cell cycle regulation. This was reflected by impaired adhesion and clonogenesis/proliferative response of T 2 D <b>PACs.</b> Saxagliptin[*]+[*]SDF- 1 α improved adhesion and tube sustaining capacity of <b>PACs</b> from T 2 D patients. CD 14 + <b>PACs</b> were more responsive to Saxagliptin than CD 14 - <b>PACs.</b> While Saxagliptin modestly reduced angiogenesis by mature endothelial cells, circulating PACs-progeny cells from T 2 D patients on Saxagliptin treatment displayed higher growth factor-inducible in vivo angiogenetic activity, compared to cells from T 2 D patients on non-incretinergic regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Saxagliptin reverses <b>PACs</b> dysfunction associated with T 2 D in vitro and improves inducible angiogenesis by circulating cells in vivo. These data add knowledge to the potential pleiotropic cardiovascular effects of DPP- 4 inhibition...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} issue of {{political}} action committees (<b>PACs)</b> within the campaign finance reform debate. Since campaign finance reform is being discussed {{in the media and}} Congress, it is a very timely topic to cover. However, this timely topic has many implications for the way campaigns are financed well into the future. Closely intertwined in this debate is the future of <b>PACs</b> and how any new legislation would affect them. Beginning with a history of campaign financing, there is an introduction to <b>PACs</b> and where they began. The financing of campaigns has gone through many cycles, reflecting the changing needs of candidates throughout the years. Because of these changes, the rules and regulations regarding financing had to be written in the 1970 's. These regulations brought about the first official recognition of <b>PACs.</b> The McCain-Feingold and Daschle campaign finance reform plans are studied in detail, specifically noting how these plans before the 105 th Congress would affect the future of <b>PACs.</b> Both plans call for the elimination of <b>PACs</b> or a reduction in the amount <b>PACs</b> can contribute. Beyond these plans, other options such as full public financing and my own ideas for campaign reform are discussed. The importance of <b>PACs</b> within the financing system is also presented as reasons for them not becoming the loser in finance reform. Although there many be some perceived negative aspects of <b>PACs,</b> the positive actions outweigh the negative aspects. Most importantly, what is shown is that much of the reform that could occur would be symbolic. Also, the problem really lies in soft money. <b>PACs</b> as special interests are often blamed for the problems when they really lie in the under-the-table soft money contributions...|$|R
