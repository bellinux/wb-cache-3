The attempts to enclose the lands, used as commons, resulted in riots, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> of disturbances that ran across the disafforested royal lands. In 1633, the Court of Exchequer Chamber of Charles I decreed the rights of the public to {{two thirds of the}} lands on the Malvern Hills, and rights of Sir Cornelius Vermuyden and his descendants, and the Crown, to one third (quoted in the preamble to the Malvern Hills Act of 1884). By that time, Malvern had become an established community and the major settlement in the Malvern Chase.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{had wanted}} to {{organize}} the Nebraska Territory without explicitly addressing the matter of slavery, but Douglas could not get enough southern support to accomplish this. Pierce was skeptical of the bill, knowing it would result in bitter opposition from the North. Douglas and Davis convinced him to support the bill regardless. It was tenaciously opposed by northerners such as Ohio Senator Salmon P. Chase and Massachusetts' Charles Sumner, who rallied public sentiment in the North against the bill. Northerners had been suspicious of the Gadsden Purchase, moves towards Cuba annexation, {{and the influence of}} slaveholding Cabinet members such as Davis, and saw the Nebraska bill as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> of southern aggression. The result was a political firestorm that did great damage to Pierce's presidency.|$|E
5|$|Saruman is in {{part the}} {{architect}} of his own downfall. Kocher, Randall Helms and Shippey write that Saruman's actions {{in the first half}} of The Two Towers, although intended to further his own interests, in fact lead to his defeat and that of Sauron: his orcs help split the Fellowship at Parth Galen, and in carrying off two of the hobbits initiate a series of incidents that lead to his ruin. In turn this frees the Rohirrim to intervene at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and then together with the men of Gondor to assault Sauron's stronghold of Mordor and distract him from Frodo's final effort to destroy the Ring. Shippey says that this demonstrates the value of persistence in the face of despair, even if a way out cannot be seen; Kocher and Helms write that it is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> of providential events and of the reversed effects of evil intentions throughout the book.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} consecration, John bought Bath Abbey's grounds from the king, {{as well as}} the city of Bath itself. Whether John paid Rufus for the town or whether he was given the town as a gift by the king is unclear. The abbey had {{recently}} lost its abbot Alfsige, and was according to Domesday Book the owner of large estates in and near the town. It would have been the wealth of the abbey that attracted John to take over the monastery. By acquiring the town of Bath, John also acquired the mint that was in the town. In 1090 he transferred the seat, or administration, of the bishopric to Bath Abbey, probably as an attempt to increase the revenues of his see. Bath was a rich abbey, and Wells had always been a poor diocese. By taking over the abbey, John increased his episcopal revenues. William of Malmesbury portrays the moving of the episcopal seat as motivated by a desire for the lands of the abbey, but it was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> at the time of moving cathedral seats from small villages to larger towns. When John moved his episcopal seat, he also took over the abbey of Bath as his cathedral chapter, turning his diocese into a bishopric served by monks instead of the canons located at Wells that had previously served the diocese.|$|E
5|$|Tensions and the {{geographic}} {{differences between the}} working and ruling classes led to Bacon's Rebellion in 1676, by which time current and former indentured servants made {{up as much as}} 80% of the population. Rebels, largely from the colony's frontier, were also opposed to the conciliatory policy towards native tribes, and one result of the rebellion was the signing at Middle Plantation of the Treaty of 1677, which made the signatory tribes tributary states and was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> of appropriating tribal land by force and treaty. Middle Plantation saw the founding of The College of William & Mary in 1693 and was renamed Williamsburg as it became the colonial capital in 1699. In 1747, a group of Virginian speculators formed the Ohio Company, with the backing of the British crown, to start English settlement and trade in the Ohio Country west of the Appalachian Mountains. France, which claimed this area as part of their colony of New France, viewed this as a threat, and the ensuing French and Indian War became part of the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). A militia from several British colonies, called the Virginia Regiment, was led by then-Lieutenant Colonel George Washington.|$|E
5|$|Bath was ravaged in {{the power}} {{struggle}} between the sons of William the Conqueror following his death in 1087.

However, his nomination was immediately in jeopardy because 44 Senate Republicans had previously vowed to derail any nominee in order to push for a decentralized structure to the organization. [...] This was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> of conflict between Republicans in the Senate and the Obama administration that had led to record numbers of blocked and failed nominations. On July 21, 2011, Senator Richard Shelby wrote an op-ed article for The Wall Street Journal affirming continued opposition (that went back to a May 5 letter to the President) to a centralized structure, noting that both the Securities Exchange Commission and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had executive boards and that the CFPB should be no different. Politico interpreted Shelby's statements as saying that Cordray's nomination was [...] "Dead on Arrival". In October, as the nomination continued to be on hold, the National Association of Attorneys General endorsed Cordray. On December 8, 2011, the Senate failed to secure cloture on Cordray's nomination.

500|$|Matt Hills and Rebecca Williams also {{discuss the}} {{treatment}} of Cordelia (and Darla) in [...] "Angels Monstrous Mothers and Vampires with Soul: Investigating the Abject in 'Television Horror'", from [...] by Stacey Abbot. They see the send-offs of Cordelia, Fred and other characters as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> of highly gendered [...] "elaborated abjection" [...] seen in Angel. They also see Cordelia's possession in season four {{as part of a}} recurring pattern: [...] "More so than other characters in [...] and Angel, Cordelia has suffered or been threatened with bodily invasion and rape, either symbolically or literally" [...] and recounts the demon impregnation in [...] "Expecting", and similarly in [...] "Epiphany", where she develops a gestating demon in her head and then told she must mate with the Groosalugg in [...] "Through the Looking Glass". Cordelia even remarks on this, as Hills and Williams quote her as she remarks on her [...] "status as a violated and devalued character"; Cordelia states, [...] "If you ever {{figure out how to get}} us out of here, I want you to find me a dimension where some demon doesn't want to impregnate me with his spawn!" [...] They liken the horror motif in these examples, and in [...] "Inside Out", to what Barbara Creed called the 'monstrous womb' in her book The Monstrous-feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis. Jes Battis also comments how, in comparison with the Fred-Illyria season five storyline, Cordelia's storyline is not as positive as Fred's rebirth, because Fred got to [...] "'live on' through Illyria, whereas Cordelia is taken right out of the show and receives no interesting blue-haired reincarnation". Continuing, they say that in fact, there is no meaningful connection between the [...] "real" [...] Cordelia and Jasmine, as the Cordelia who did those bad things is killed the moment Jasmine is, [...] "and the 'true' Cordy wakes up from her coma". Further illustrating the comparisons, [...] "Fred/Illyria become a joined mother/daughter subjectivity, a dual being whose constituent essences are inseparable; Cordelia is never so intimately connected with her evil child and is remembered as the healthy, vibrant Cordy that everyone knew." [...] Pointing out symbolic parallels in the subtexts of these gestations, Battis notes Cordelia, a vocal advocate of her own privilege, creates a fully formed supernatural being, Jasmine, who attempts (shockingly) to control the world. Fred, on the other hand, who internalizes her own privilege and cannot express it except in terms of insecurity and awkwardness, has her body devoured from the inside by the demon Illyria.|$|E
