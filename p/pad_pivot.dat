40|$|A novel {{tilting pad}} journal bearing model {{including}} pivot flexibility {{as well as}} temporal fluid inertia effects on the thin film fluid flow aims to accurately predict the bearing forced performance. The predictive model also accounts for the thermal energy transport effects in a TPJB. A Fortran program with an Excel GUI models TPJBs and delivers predictions of the bearing static and dynamic forced performance. The calculation algorithm uses a Newton-Raphson procedure for successful iterations on the equilibrium pad radial and transverse displacements and journal center displacements, even for bearings pads with very soft pivots. The predictive model accounts for the effect of film temperature on the operating bearing and pad clearances by calculating the thermal expansion of the journal and pad surfaces. The pad inlet thermal mixing coefficient (lambda) influences moderately the predicted fluid film temperature field. <b>Pad</b> <b>pivot</b> flexibility decreases significantly and dominates the bearing stiffness and damping coefficients when the pivot stiffness is lower than 10 % of the fluid film stiffness coefficients (with rigid pivots). Pivot flexibility has a more pronounced effect on reducing the bearing damping coefficients than the stiffness coefficients. <b>Pad</b> <b>pivot</b> flexibility may still affect the bearing behavior at a light load condition for a bearing with a large pad preload. <b>Pad</b> <b>pivot</b> flexibility, {{as well as the}} fluid inertia and the pads? mass and mass moment of inertia, could influence the bearing impedance coefficients, in particular at high whirl frequencies. The stiffness and damping coefficients of a TPJB increase with a reduction in the operating bearing and pad clearances. The work delivers a predictive tool benchmarked against a number of experimental results for test bearings available in the recent literature. The static and dynamic forced performance characteristics of actual TPJBs can not be accurately predicted unless their pad flexibility and pivot flexibility, fluid film temperature, pad inlet thermal mixing coefficient, operating bearing and pad clearances, among others are well known in advance. However, the extensive archival literature showcasing test procedures and experimental results for TPJBs does not report the above parameters. Thus, reasonable assumptions on the magnitude of certain elusive parameters for use in the predictive TPJB model are necessary...|$|E
40|$|Abstract âˆ’ Recent studies {{emphasize}} the importance of pivot stiffness in the analysis of tilting pad bearings (TPBs). The present paper develops a finite element model of the <b>pad</b> <b>pivot</b> and compares the predicted pivot stiffness to the results of Hertzian contact model calculations. Specifically, a finite element analysis generates tetrahedral mesh models with ~ 40, 000 nodes for a ball-socket pivot and ~ 50, 000 nodes for a rocker-back pivot. These models assume a frictionless boundary condition in the contact area. Increasing the applied loads on the pad in conjunction with increasing time steps ensures rapid convergence during the nonlinear numerical analysis. Predictions are performed using the developed finite element model for increasing the differential diameters between the <b>pad</b> <b>pivot</b> (or ball) and the bearing housing (or socket). The predictions show that the pivot contact area increases with decreasing dif-ferential diameters and increasing applied loads. Further, the maximum deformation occurring at the pivot center increases with increasing differential diameters and increasing applied loads. The pivot stiffness increases non-linearly with decreasing differential diameters and increasing applied loads. Comparisons of results of the developed finite element model to those of Hertzian contact model calculations assuming a small contact area show that the latter model underestimates the pivot stiffnesses predicted by the finite element models of the ball-socket and rocker-back pivots, particularly for small differential diameters. This result implies the need for cautionduring the desig...|$|E

40|$|Plans to {{shut down}} nuclear power plants in some European {{countries}} as well as increased electricity production by wind and solar power will increase the work load on hydroelectric power plants in the future. Also, due to the power grid regulations, hydroelectric power plants undergo more frequent start-ups and shut-downs. During such transient periods, a large amplitude shaft motion can occur, especially in the power plants with vertical shafts. Large shaft motion is not desirable because {{it can lead to}} a machine failure. Furthermore, performance limitations of conventional white metal or babbitted bearings call for the development of new bearing designs. An outstanding tribological performance can be achieved by introducing compliant polymer liners. At the same time, bearings with compliant liners may alter rotor-bearing system dynamic behaviour compared to the systems with conventional white metal bearings. The research approach of this thesis is to employ nonlinear analysis to provide further understanding of the compliant bearing dynamic response to synchronous shaft excitation. Plain cylindrical journal bearings with different compliant liner thicknesses were analysed using a nonlinear approach. The numerical model was verified with an in-house developed code at steady state conditions. Results obtained by the numerical models showed good agreement. After verification of the numerical model for fixed geometry journal bearings, models for tilting pad journal bearings were developed. Results for the tilting pad journal bearing with three pads with line pivot geometry were compared with published data in dynamic conditions.

40|$|Due to {{government}} regulations together with {{health and safety}} reasons, there are increasing demands on reducing hazardous polluting chemicals from fossil fuel power plants. Therefore, more efforts are imposed on using renewable resources such as water, wind, solar and tide to produce clean/green electricity. On top of that, there is another increasing demand from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to operate power plants with higher load while keep the power loss to the minimum. These requirements drive conventional fluid film bearings to its mechanical and temperature limits. This calls {{for the development of}} new bearing system designs. An outstanding tribological performance such as low start-up and break-away friction, excellent resistance to chemical attack and anti-seizure properties, can be achieved by introducing compliant polymer liners. At the same time, bearings with compliant liners may alter rotor-bearing system dynamic behaviour compared to the systems with conventional white metal bearings. The research approach of this thesis is to implement compliant liner on bearing surface, impose synchronous shaft excitation and investigate the effect of bearing design parameters on bearing dynamic response. Plain cylindrical journal bearings with different compliant liner thicknesses were analysed using a FEM approach. The numerical model was compared with an in-house developed code based on the finite difference method (FDM) for a bearing operated at steady state conditions. Results obtained by the numerical models showed good agreement. After verification of the numerical model for fixed geometry journal bearings, models for tilting pad journal bearings were developed. Dynamic behaviour of the tilting pad journal bearing with three pads with line pivot geometry was compared with published data. A good agreement was obtained between the two numerical models.

It is shown how these factors should be selected to control the journal orbit sizes. Misalignments in compliant tilting pad journal bearings were analysed for load between pivots and load on pivots with consideration of thermal effects. Significant improvements in bearing performance were obtained with compliant bearings compared to white metal bearings. Furthermore, different polymer materials (PTFE, UHMWPE, pure PEEK and PEEK composite) were characterized using Frequency Response Function (FRF). It was shown that as the excitation frequency increased the equivalent stiffness was more or less constant while equivalent damping decreased exponentially. PTFE had similar equivalent stiffness compared to PEEK. As for equivalent damping, PTFE had slightly higher damping compared to PEEK or UHMWPE.

40|$|Measured and {{predicted}} static and dynamic characteristics are provided for a four-pad, rocker-pivot, tilting-pad journal bearing in the load-on-pad and load-between-pad orientations. The bearing has the following characteristics: 4 pads,. 57 <b>pad</b> <b>pivot</b> offset, 0. 6 L/D ratio, 60. 33 mm (2. 375 in) pad axial length, 0. 08255 mm (0. 00325 in) radial clearance in the load-on-pad orientation, and 0. 1189 mm (0. 00468 in) radial clearance in the load-between-pad orientation. Tests {{were conducted on}} a floating test bearing design with unit loads ranging from 0 to 2903 kPa (421. 1 psi) and speeds from 6. 8 to 13. 2 krpm. For all rotor speeds, hot-clearance measurements were taken to show the reduction in bearing clearance due to thermal expansion of the shaft and pads during testing. As the testing conditions get hotter, the rotor, pads, and bearing expand, decreasing radial bearing clearance. Hot-clearance measurements showed a 16 - 25 % decrease in clearance compared to a clearance measurement at room temperature. For all test conditions, dynamic tests were performed over a range of excitation frequencies to obtain complex dynamic stiffness coefficients {{as a function of}} frequency. The direct real dynamic stiffness coefficients were then fitted with a quadratic function with respect to frequency. From the curve fit, the frequency dependence was captured by including a virtual-mass matrix [M] to produce a frequency independent [K][C][M] model. The direct dynamic stiffness coefficients for the load-on-pad orientation showed significant orthotropy, while the load-between-pad did not. The load-between-pad showed slight orthotropy as load increased. Experimental cross-coupled stiffness coefficients were measured in both load orientations, but were of the same sign and significantly less than direct stiffness coefficients. In both orientations the imaginary part of the measured dynamic stiffness increased linearly with increasing frequency, allowing for frequency independent direct damping coefficients. Rotordynamic coefficients presented were compared to predictions from two different Reynolds-based models. Both models showed the importance of taking into account pivot flexibility and different pad geometries (due to the reduction in bearing clearance during testing) in predicting rotordynamic coefficients. If either of these two inputs were incorrect, then predictions for the bearings impedance coefficients were very inaccurate. The main difference between prediction codes {{is that one of the}} codes incorporates pad flexibility in predicting the impedance coefficients for a tilting-pad journal bearing. To look at the effects that pad flexibility has on predicting the impedance coefficients, a series of predictions were created by changing the magnitude of the pad's bending stiffness. Increasing the bending stiffness used in predictions by a factor of 10 typically caused a 3 - 11 % increase in predicted Kxx and Kyy, and a 10 - 24 % increase in predicted Cxx and Cyy. In all cases, increasing the calculated bending stiffness from ten to a hundred times the calculated value caused slight if any change in Kxx, Kyy, Cxx, and Cyy. For a flexible pad an increase in bending stiffness can have a large effect on predictions; however, for a more rigid pad an increase in pad bending stiffness will have a much lesser effect. Results showed that the pad's structural bending stiffness can be an important factor in predicting impedance coefficients. Even though the pads tested in this thesis are extremely stiff, changes are still seen in predictions when the magnitude of the pad?s bending stiffness is increased, especially in Cxx, and Cyy. The code without pad flexibility predicted Kxx and Kyy much more accurately than the code with pad flexibility. The code with pad flexibility predicts Cxx more accurately, while the code without pad flexibility predicted Cyy more accurately. Regardless of prediction Code used, the Kxx and Kyy were over-predicted at low loads, but predicted more accurately as load increased. Cxx, and Cyy were modeled very well in the load-on-pad orientation, while slightly overpredicted in the load-between-pad orientation. For solid pads, like the ones tested here, both codes do a decent job at predicting impedance coefficient...|$|E
40|$|Tilting pad journal {{bearings}} (TPJBs) supporting rotors for high performance turbomachinery have undergone steady design improvements to satisfy more stringent operating conditions that include large specific loads due to smaller footprints, and high surface speeds that produce larger drag power losses and lubricant temperature rise. Simultaneously, predictive models continuously evolve to include minute details on bearing geometry, <b>pads</b> and <b>pivots?</b> configurations, oil delivery systems, etc. This thesis introduces a fluid film flow model including both <b>pad</b> and <b>pivot</b> flexibility {{to predict the}} static and dynamic force performance of typical TPJBs. This performance encompasses journal eccentricity, drag power loss, lubricant temperature rise, fluid film thickness, fluid film pressure, bearing complex stiffnesses, static stiffnesses, damping coefficients and virtual mass coefficients. A finite element (FE) pad structural model (with/without the Babbitt layer) is coupled to a thin film flow model to determine the mechanical deformation of the pad upper surface. Recently, Gaines and Childs conducted experiments with three TPJB sets, each having three pads, over a range of load and rotational speed conditions. To quantify the effect of pad flexibility on the bearings? dynamic performance, the pad thickness varies from thin to thick, t= 8. 5 mm, 10 mm and 11. 5 mm. The test data shows that pad flexibility reduces the journal eccentricity and the dynamic force coefficients. The current model with both <b>pad</b> and <b>pivot</b> flexibility delivers predictions correlating favorably with the test data, in particular the bearing stiffnesses, yet it overestimates the bearing damping coefficients. Predictions for bearing models available in the archival literature show that the maximum pad surface deformation occurs on the loaded pad at both its leading and trailing edges; i. e. under mechanical pressure a pad opens. The deformation at the pad mid-plane (Z= 0) is slightly larger than that at the pad side edges (Z=? 1 / 2 L). Contrary {{to the effect of}} pivot flexibility that leads to an increase in journal eccentricity, pad flexibility tends to reduce the journal eccentricity, similar as in tests reported by Gaines. A soft pad (elastic) decreases significantly the bearing stiffnesses and the damping coefficients by up to 20 %. A parametric study follows to quantify the influence of pad thickness on the rotordynamic force coefficients of two sample TPJBs: one with three pads of increasing preload, (p r = 0, 0. 25 and 0. 5), and another one with four pads of null preload (p r = 0). The bearing pads are either rigid or flexible by varying their thickness. For design considerations, dimensionless static and dynamic characteristics of the bearings are presented versus the Sommerfeld number (S). An appendix introduces a one-dimensional beam equation to approximate the pad deformation accounting for the Babbitt layer. Based on this equation, a dimensionless pad flexibility parameter is defined. Pad flexibility shows a more pronounced effect on the journal eccentricity and the force coefficients of a TPJB with null pad preload than for bearings with large pad preloads (0. 25 and 0. 5), in particular for operation with a small load or at a high surface speed (S> 0. 8). With the same pad preload, pad flexibility affects more the dynamic force coefficients for a load on pad (LOP) bearing than those for a load between pad (LBP) bearing...|$|R

40|$|Measured and {{predicted}} static and dynamic load characteristics are provided for a three-pad, rocker-pivot, tilting-pad journal bearing in the load-between-pad orientation. The bearing has the following characteristics: 3 pads,. 50 <b>pad</b> <b>pivot</b> offset, 0. 6 L/D ratio, 60. 69 mm (2. 4 in) pad axial length, and 0. 0762 mm (0. 003 in) radial clearance. Three interchangeable pad configurations were tested with pad thicknesses of 8. 5 mm (0. 33 in), 10 mm (0. 39 in), and 11. 5 mm (. 45 in). Tests {{were performed on}} a test bearing floating about a rigid rotor design with unit loads ranging from 172 to 1, 724 kPa (25 to 250 psi) and speeds from 6 to 12 krpm. Cold and hot clearances were taken to measure the nominal and operating, respectively, radial bearing clearance. The cold clearance was taken at room temperature while the hot clearance was taken for each operating speed immediately after the rig was shut down. The hot bearing clearance shows a 23 ? 34 % decrease in radial bearing clearance. As the operating speed increased, the operating temperature in the bearing increased. The increase in operating temperatures caused the bearing and pads to expand and reduced the radial bearing clearance. Static load tests were performed once the test rig reached steady-state conditions. The maximum measured eccentricity ratio was over one for each pad configuration. As pad flexibility increased, the static eccentricity ratio decreased. The eccentricity ratio predictions agreed well with the measured results in the loaded direction. The measured attitude angles were as high as approximately 10 ?. The attitude angles remained fairly constant at low rotational speeds for tp = 8. 5 mm and tp = 10 mm and decreased as unit load increased for tp = 11. 5 mm. XL_TPJB? predicted attitude angles that had a smaller magnitude than the measured results for all rotational speed and unit load conditions and were negative. The temperatures did not vary greatly across pad configurations. The predictions agreed well with the measured values at low speeds and low unit loads. As the operating speed and unit load increased, the predictions were lower than the measured values. Pad flexibility was characterized as {{the change in the}} pad?s bending stiffness or the change in pad thickness. A finite-element model (FEM) was created in SolidWorks? to predict the structural bending stiffness of each pad configuration. Once the pivot was fixed in the FEM, a uniform pressure distribution was applied to the rotor-side surface of the pad. Results from the finite-element analysis (FEA) show an increase in pad flexibility as the thickness of the pad decreased. Dynamic load tests were performed for all nominal test conditions over a range of excitation frequencies to obtain complex dynamic-stiffness coefficients as a function of excitation frequency. The real and imaginary parts of dynamic-stiffness were fitted with quadratic and linear models, respectively, with respect to excitation frequency. A constant coefficient [K][C][M] model produced frequency-independent rotordynamic coefficients. For the load-between-pad configuration, the dynamic-stiffness coefficients show significant bearing orthotropy, especially as the unit load increased. In general, the dynamic-stiffness was larger in the non-loading direction {{than it was in the}} loading direction. Negative virtual mass coefficients were commonly obtained for all pad configuration. To examine the effect of pad flexibility on the rotordynamic coefficients, the measured results were compared across each pad configuration. The measured results show that the increase in pad flexibility decreased the direct damping coefficients by 12 - 20 % and, on average, decreased the cross-coupled damping coefficients by approximately 10 %. On average, the measured results show a slight increase in the stiffness coefficients as pad flexibility increased. The direct stiffness coefficients varied from an increase of 12 % at low unit loads and a decrease of 3 % at high unit loads. The cross-coupled stiffness coefficients change by 0 to 12 % as pad flexibility increased. In general, the direct virtual mass coefficients decreased by approximately 29 % as pad flexibility increased. The average change for the cross-coupled coefficients is an increase in Mxy and Myx by 2 % as pad flexibility increased. XL_TPJB? was used to predict the performance of the tilting-pad bearing tested in this work. XL_TPJB? accounts for pad and pivot flexibility. The predictions using XL_TPJB? agreed well with the measured values for direct stiffness coefficients. For a given pad set, the predictions agreed well with the measured results for one operating speed case and were either lower or higher than the measured results for the remaining speed cases for Cxx. The predicted values were generally higher than the measured values for Cyy at low unit loads and were lower than measured values at high unit loads. The measured values had a smaller magnitude than the predictions for the direct virtual-mass coefficients at lower speeds. At higher speeds, the predictions had a lower magnitude than the measured direct virtual-mass coefficients. All cross-coupled-coefficient predictions were nearly zero and, the measured values were typically non-zero and negative. A non-dimensional pad flexibility parameter ?flex was used to relate the pad flexibility of multiple bearings of different sizes. The parameter related the average deflection across the pad surface to the pad?s arc length. XL_TPJB? was used to predict the percent change in direct damping coefficients for a rigid pad, flexible pivot and flexible pad, flexible pivot for a surface speed of 54 m/s and a unit load of 783 kPa. The results show the pads tested in this thesis are extremely flexible compared to pads used in industry. Results show that the pad?s structural bending stiffness or flexibility is important when predicting the bearing?s dynamic performance. Damping is consistently over-predicting when excluding pad flexibility, and this could have a significant impact in predicting the bearing?s stability characteristics. In general, all codes should account for pad flexibility, as well as pivot flexibility, to properly predict the performance of a tilting-pad journal bearing...|$|E
40|$|Many {{researchers}} have compared predicted stiffness and damping coefficients for tilting-pad journal bearings (TPJBs) to measurements. Most {{have found that}} direct damping is consistently overpredicted. The thrust {{of this research is}} to explain the difference between measured and predicted stiffness and damping coefficients for TPJBs, and to provide some confidence to designers that TPJB dynamic coefficients can be accurately predicted. 	Most analytical models for TPJBs are {{based on the assumption that}} explicit dependence on pad motion can be eliminated by assuming harmonic rotor motion such that the amplitude and phase of pad motions resulting from radial and transverse rotor motions are predicted by rotor-pad transfer functions. In short, these transfer functions specify the amplitude and phase of pad motion (angular, radial, translational, etc.) in response to an input rotor motion. 	A new pad perturbation model is developed including the effects of angular, radial, and circumferential pad motion and changes in pad clearance due to pad bending compliance. Though all of these pad variables have previously been included in different analyses, there are no publications containing perturbations of all four variables. In addition, previous {{researchers have}} only perturbed the journal, while both the bearing and journal motions are perturbed in the present analysis, and the applicability of comparing rotor-perturbed bearing impedance predictions to impedances measured on a bearing-perturbed test rig is discussed. This perturbation model was implemented in a Reynolds-based TPJB code to predict the frequency-dependent bearing impedances and rotor-pad transfer functions. 	Direct measurements of pad motion during test excitation were recorded to produce measured transfer functions between rotor and pad motion, and a comparison between these measurements and predictions is given. Motion probes were added to the loaded pad (having the static load vector directed through its pivot) of a 5 -pad TPJB to obtain accurate measurement of pad radial and tangential motion, as well as tilt, yaw, and pitch. Strain gages were attached to the side of the loaded pad to measure static and dynamic bending strains, which were then used to determine static and dynamic changes in pad curvature (pad clearance). 	Good agreement was found between the amplitude of the measured and predicted transfer functions concerning radial and transverse pad motions throughout the range of speeds and loads tested, while pad tilt was moderately underpredicted. 	For the bearing investigated, radial pad motions resulting from pivot compliance were as large as 60 % of the radial component of shaft motion when operating at 4400 rpm under heavily loaded conditions. Hence, if a dynamic load applied to the shaft resulted in a shaft displacement of 25 microns (1 mil), the pad would displace radially 15 microns (0. 6 mils), and the fluid film height would only decrease by 10 microns (0. 4 mils). The consequence of this pad motion is that fluid film stiffness and damping forces produced by relative rotor-pad motions are significantly reduced, resulting in a bearing having significantly less direct stiffness and damping than predicted. A similar effect occurs when shaft motions produce significant changes in pad clearance due to pad compliance. For the pad tested here, the measurements show that predicting TPJB stiffness and damping coefficients without accounting for pad and pivot compliance will produce large errors, and is not advised. 	Transverse pad motion was predicted and observed. Based on phase measurements, this motion is lightly damped, and appears to be caused by pivot deflection instead of slipping. Despite observing a lightly damped phase change, an increase in magnitude at this natural frequency was not observed. 	Predicted direct stiffness and damping for unit loads from 0 - 3200 kPa (0 - 450 psi) fit through 1. 5 ? running speed are within 18 % of measurements at 4400 rpm, while predictions at 10200 rpm are within 10 % of measurements. This is a significant improvement on the accuracy of predictions cited in literature. 	 	Comparisons between predictions from the developed bearing model neglecting <b>pad,</b> <b>pivot,</b> and pad and pivot flexibility show that predicted direct stiffness and damping coefficients for a model having a rigid pad and pivot are overestimated, respectively, by 202 % and 811 % at low speeds and large loads, by 176 % and 513 % at high speeds and high loads, and by 51 % and 182 % at high speeds and light loads. While the reader is likely questioning the degree to which these predictions are overestimated in regard to previous comparisons, these predictions are based on measured operating bearing clearances, which are 20 - 30 % smaller than the cold bearing clearances that previous comparisons were based on. 	The effect of employing a full bearing model (retaining all of the pad degrees of freedom) versus a reduced bearing model (where only journal degrees of freedom are retained) in a stability calculation for a realistic rotor-bearing system is assessed. For the bearing tested, the bearing coefficients reduced at the frequency of the unstable eigenvalue (subsynchronously reduced) predicted a destabilizing cross-coupled stiffness coefficient at the onset of instability within 1 % of the full model, while synchronously reduced coefficients for the lightly loaded bearing required 25 % more destabilizing cross-coupled stiffness than the full model to cause system instability. This overestimation of stability is due to an increase in predicted direct damping at the synchronous frequency over the subsynchronously reduced value. This increase in direct damping with excitation frequency was also seen in highly loaded test data at frequencies below approximately 2 ?running speed, after which direct damping decreased with increasing excitation frequency. This effect was more pronounced in predictions, occurring at all load and speed combinations. 	The same stability calculation was performed using measured stiffness and damping coefficients at synchronous and subsynchronous frequencies at 10200 rpm. It was found that both the synchronously measured stiffness and damping and predictions using the full bearing model were more conservative than the model using subsynchronously measured stiffness and damping. This outcome contrasts with the comparison between models using synchronously and subsynchronously reduced impedance predictions, which showed the subsynchronously reduced model to be the most conservative. This contrast results from a predicted increase in damping with increasing excitation frequency at all speeds and loads, while this increase in damping with increasing excitation frequency was only measured at the most heavily loaded conditions...|$|E
40|$|Nonlinear response, bifurcations and {{stability}} of rotor-fluid film bearing systems are studied using various numerical investigation schemes such as autonomous/non-autonomous shooting, arc-length continuation, direct numerical integrations, Poincar? sections, Lyapunov exponents, etc. Two types of hydrodynamic bearings, a floating ring bearing (FRB) and a tilting pad journal bearing (TPJB), are employed in this study. The nonlinear characteristic of each bearing is analyzed as supports of a rigid rotor system {{as well as a}} flexible rotor system. Depending on the existence of the unbalance force on the rotor/disks, autonomous (free vibration) and non-autonomous responses (mass unbalanced excitation) are both identified, and the nonlinear reaction force produced on the lubricant layer is obtained using the finite element method. In addition to isoviscosity lubricants, thermo-hydrodynamic lubricant model is developed to investigate thermal effects on rotordynamic bifurcations; in the procedure, a variable viscosity Reynolds equation and the energy equation are solved simultaneously. For computation efficiency in the analytical bifurcation study, an advanced shooting algorithm, which is combined with the deflation theory and the parallel computing strategy, is proposed for both the autonomous and the non-autonomous cases. In the study with flexible rotors, the finite element based beam models are employed and the model reduction technique such as Component Mode Synthesis is utilized to condense the system degree of freedom. This dissertation consists of four main discussions regarding: 1) nonlinear response and bifurcations of a rigid rotor supported by FRBs; 2) effects of a thermo-hydrodynamic (THD) FRB model on rotordynamic bifurcations; 3) nonlinear response and bifurcations of a rigid rotor supported by TPJBs; 4) extension of study to general, complex, multi-mass rotor beam models. In case 1), multiple coexistent solutions and bifurcation scenarios are identified, and those are depended on the ratio of floating ring length to diameter (L/D). Numerical illustrations regarding jumps between two stable limit cycles and quenching large vibrations are demonstrated, and chaos is investigated with the aid of Lyanpunov exponent. In case 2), the Hopf bifurcation onset is strongly dependent on thermal conditions, and the saddle node bifurcation points are significantly shifted compared to the isothermal model. In addition, the unbalanced responses stability and bifurcation onsets are highly reliant on the lubricant supply temperature. In case 3), loci of bifurcations are identified, and heavily loaded bearings and/or high unbalance force may induce consecutive transference of response in forms of synchronous to sub-synchronous, quasi-periodic responses and chaotic motions. The periodic doubling bifurcations, saddle node bifurcations and corresponding local stability are reliably determined by selections of <b>pad</b> preload, <b>pivot</b> offset, and lubricant viscosity sets. In case 4), two industrial applications such as a turbocharger supported by FRBs and an eight-stage centrifugal compressor supported by TPJBs are numerically analyzed. The turbocharger shows that torus appears with Neimark-Sacker bifurcation events and the motions are dominant in the high speed ranges (> 60, 000 rpm). In the compressor, sub-/super-synchronous motions are identified other than the ? 1 synchronous response, and the appearance of each harmonic is highly depended on the selection of <b>pad</b> preload and <b>pivot</b> offset...|$|R
40|$|A bearing damper, {{operating}} on the support flexure of a <b>pivoted</b> <b>pad</b> in a tilting-pad type gas-lubricated journal bearing, has been designed, built, and tested under externally-applied random vibrations. The NASA Brayton Rotating Unit (BRU), a 36, 000 rpm, 10 -Kwe turbogenerator had previously been subjected in the MTI Vibration Test Laboratory to external random vibrations, and vibration response data had been recorded and analyzed for amplitude distribution and frequency content {{at a number of}} locations in the machine. Based on data from that evaluation, a piston-type damper was designed and developed for each of the two flexibly-supported journal bearing pads (one in each of the two three-pad bearings). A modified BRU, with dampers installed, has been re-tested under random vibration conditions. Root-mean-square vibration amplitudes were determined from the test data, and displacement power spectral density analyses have been performed. Results of these data reduction efforts have been compared with vibration tolerance limits. Results of the tests indicate significant reductions in vibration levels in the bearing gas-lubricant films, particularly in the rigidly-mounted pads. The utility of the gas-lubricated damper for limiting rotor-bearing system vibrations in high-speed turbomachinery has thus been demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Three flexure <b>pivot</b> <b>pad</b> {{bearings}} (FPBs) {{with different}} preloads are evaluated {{for use in}} high performance applications by comparing them to a hybrid hydrostatic bearing (HHB). One application of these bearings is in turbopumps for liquid rocket engines. To evaluate bearing performance, the lift-off speed of the shaft from the bearing surface is experimentally determined. Experimental data of lift-off are collected using a circuit running through the shaft and the designed bearing. Other methods for measuring liftoff speeds were attempted but did not yield consistent results. Water {{is used as a}} lubricant to simulate a low viscosity medium. In comparison to load-capacity-based predictions for FPBs, the experimental results showed lower lift-off speeds, higher load capacities, higher eccentricity ratios, and lower attitude angles. The bearings? predicted load capacity determined lift-off speed predictions, but the experimental results show no clear trend relating lift-off speed to load capacity. This was for a range of running speeds, with the design speed defined as the final speed in a particular test case. At 0. 689 bar supply pressure and for a design speed of 3000 rpm, the HHB showed greater load capacities and lower eccentricities than the FPBs, but the FPBs had lower lift-off speeds and attitude angles. In fact, the FPBs in the load-between-pad orientation outperformed the HHB in the load-on-pocket orientation with lower lift-off speeds for the shaft weight-only case. An increased supply pressure lowered the lift-off speeds in the HHB tests. If the load in the bearing application remains relatively small, a FPB could be substituted for an HHB...|$|R
40|$|TRACT The current design {{trend of}} {{rotating}} machines like turbogenerators, compressors, turbines, and pumps {{is focused on}} obtaining both high dynamic performances and high versatility of machines in different operating conditions. The first target is nowadays achieved by equipping machines with tilting pad journal bearings. For the second target, State-of-the-Art researches {{are focused on the}} development of active systems able to adapt the dynamic behavior of the machine to the external environment and new operating conditions. Typical causes of large vibration in rotating machines are faults, residual unbalance, resonance condition and instabilities. Aiming at vibration reduction, in recent years many studies are carried out to investigate different solutions; one of them is based on active tilting pad journal bearing. In this paper, the authors investigate, by simulations, the reduction of shaft vibration by controlling the motion of the pads of a tilting pad journal bearing. The basic idea is to balance the exciting force on the shaft with a suitable resulting force of the oil-film pressure distribution. In particular, a sliding mode controller has been considered and both angular rotation of the <b>pads</b> about the <b>pivot</b> and the radial motion of the pivot have been analyzed. Sliding mode control guarantees high robustness of the control system in real applications that can be characterized by a strong non-linear behavior. In the paper a general consideration about the bearing, the actuating methods and the control system have been provided. A numerical analysis of large size rotor equipped with active pads has been carried out in order to verify the effectiveness of the system in several conditions, even during the most critical operating phase, i. e. the lateral critical speed...|$|R
40|$|LectureTilting pads {{journal bearing}} (TPJB) force {{coefficients}} are usually {{evaluated by the}} Lund approach where pad degrees of freedom are reduced {{to those of the}} shaft (8 Synchronous Reduced Coefficients), therefore for each shaft perturbation pads are assumed to simultaneously response. This assumption might not remain valid {{in the presence of a}} particular combination of rotor-bearings system and operating condition. In such systems pad inertia leads to a phase delay between the same pad and shaft movement. Depending on the rotor-bearing system the synchronous reduced assumption may not be accurate to identify the instability threshold speed and an explicit modeling of pad dynamic (degree of freedom) has to be incorporated into the rotordynamic analysis. The synchronous reduced method is still accurate in the determination of threshold speed for current turbomachine technology. For future advanced challenging applications the understanding and definition of the applicability of the reduced method is necessary. The predicted sub-synchronous instability (negative logarithmic decrement) presented in this paper are calculated by introducing in the finite element model (beam elements) additional nodes (respect to shaft generalized coordinates) at bearing locations to represent the pads degrees of freedom. The calculations were repeated to predict the instability threshold speed using the classical Lund approach and it has been verified that using this method the instability threshold speed is over predicted with respect to those obtained in the above mentioned analysis. The comparison of the calculations highlights the important difference in the speed threshold values given by the two methods for the system considered. A development activity has been performed to test a configuration of rotor-bearings system of high peripheral speed (> 75 m/s) and large bearing diameter (> 180 mm) verifying the tools prediction capability. The scope of this work is to compare experimental observed sub-synchronous vibration (instability threshold speed) with the predictions in order to consolidate the reliability of the method. To enforce the validation the same test are repeated with different TPJB designs in order to test different bearing configurations in terms of micro-geometry, <b>pad</b> arc length, <b>pivot</b> stiffness etc...|$|R
40|$|Static, dynamic, {{and thermal}} {{characteristics}} (measured and predicted) are presented for a 4 -pad, spherical-seat, TPJB with 0. 5 pivot offset, 0. 6 L/D, 101. 6 mm nominal diameter, and 0. 3 preload in the LBP orientation. One bearing is tested four separate {{times in the}} following four different lubrication configurations: (1) flooded single-orifice (SO) at the bearing shell, (2) evacuated leading edge groove (LEG), (3) evacuated spray-bar blocker (SBB), and (4) evacuated spray-bar (SB). The LEG, SBB, and SB are all considered methods of ?directed lubrication?. These methods rely on lubrication injected directly to the pad/rotor interface. The same set of pads is used for every test to maintain clearance and preload; each method of lubrication is added as an assembly to the bearing. Test conditions include surface speeds and unit loads up to 85 m/s and 2. 9 MPa respectively. Static data includes measured bearing clearances prior to operation (cold) and immediately after operation (hot), rotor-bearing eccentricities and attitude angles, and {{a new approach to}} locating the hot center of a bearing. Dynamic data includes: (1) impedance values calculated from measured accelerations, displacements, and excitation forces; and (2) four sets (one set for each bearing configuration) of direct and cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients derived from measurements and fit to a frequency independent KCM model. Thermal data include measured temperatures from sixteen bearing thermocouples along with inlet, outlet, stator housing, and ambient thermocouples. Twelve of the bearing thermocouples are embedded in the babbitt layer of the pads while the remaining four are oriented at the leading and trailing edge of the loaded pads exposed to the lubricant. Bearing thermocouples provide a circumferential and axial temperature gradient. The <b>pivot</b> stiffness (<b>pad</b> and <b>pivot</b> in series) is measured and incorporated into predictions. Measured static, dynamic, and thermal values are compared to predictions from XL_TPJB, a computer code developed at the Texas A&M University Turbomachinery Lab for predicting bearing performance. Measurements show significant cross-coupled stiffness terms with opposite signs and magnitudes that are 20 - 50 % of the direct terms, a max axial temperature gradient of 9. 6 ?C, and attitude angles as high as 29 ?; all of these indicate that the tilt motion of the pad may be impeded by friction between the spherical <b>pivot</b> and the <b>pad.</b> Temperature measurements show directed lubrication, coupled with an evacuated bearing housing, reduces max bearing temperatures up to 13. 9 ?C for the LEG, 10. 2 ?C for the SBB, and 12. 8 ?C for the SB. Although the SB and SBB reduce the max bearing temperature as intended, they can also cause an increase in temperatures at the leading and trailing edges of the loaded pads. The LEG typically reduced temperatures at all locations. Compared to the base case of the flooded SO, directed lubrication reduces the max bearing temperature. Additionally, the dynamics of the system can also be significantly impacted. Using directed lubrication can reduce direct stiffness by up to 18 % for the LEG, 25 % for the SBB, and 20 % for the SB. Similarly, the direct damping can be reduced by up to 24 % for the LEG, 45 % for the SBB, and 34 % for the SB...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis concerns computer simulations of the lubrication process. The main subject of interest is elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) and, to some extent, hydrodynamic lubrication (HD). The thesis comprises an introductory section and three papers; referred to as A, B and C. Simulation of EHL is an inter-disciplinary task, incorporating the fields of fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, thermodynamics and rheology. In almost all numerical simulations of lubrication performed today, the hydrodynamics are modelled using the Reynolds equation. This equation {{is derived from the}} equations of momentum and continuity and using the thin film approximation. However, the assumptions made when deriving this equation limits the size of the computational/spatial domain and the equation cannot predict pressure variations across the lubricating oil film. The subject of papers A and B are numerical simulations using the full equations of momentum and continuity, (Paper B), and the equation of energy (Paper A). The main aim of the work was to investigate the possibilities of carrying out numerical simulations based on the above equations. The rheology was assumed to be Newtonian; the equations are then commonly referred to as the Navier-Stokes equations (N-S). The second aim of the work was to investigate the possibilities of using a commercial software, CFX 4. 3 [1], to carry out the numerical simulations. The results in Paper A show {{that it is possible to}} simulate thermal EHL line contacts up to pressures of approximately 1 GPa. The limitations of the approach are due to a singularity that can occur in the equation of momentum when a critical shear stress is reached. With a more complete rheological model (non-Newtonian rheology) it should be possible to perform simulations at even higher contact pressures. Paper B presents the results of isothermal simulations comparing the N-S and Reynolds equation approaches. The result show that there may be some discrepancies between the two approaches; although only small discrepancies have been observed in the smooth line contact simulations made. The characteristics of the EHL-contact with a wide range of scales and large gradients in pressure, viscosity and temperature make developing accurate numerical simulations to a difficult task. The computational cost is high due to the small under-relaxations factors that must be used in order to obtain converged numerical solutions. The work to date has shown that is possible to use the extended approach in conjunction with a commercial software, CFX 4. 3 [1]. This approach makes it possible to extend the computational domain in future in EHL-simulations, where the Reynolds approach is not valid. Paper C presents the results of simulations of a lubricated pivoted thrust bearing. The objective of this study was to verify a thermo-hydrodynamic (THD) model for this type of bearing. The model developed handles three-dimensional temperature distribution in the oil film and pad, as well as two-dimensional temperature variation in the runner. The viscosity and density are treated as functions of both temperature and pressure. Experiments have been performed in a test rig consisting of two identical equalising <b>pivoted</b> <b>pad</b> thrust bearings. Experimentally measured power loss, runner temperature and pressure profiles as a function of load and rotational speed were compared with the theoretical investigations. The results showed fairly good agreement when the oil inlet temperature and heat transfer coefficients were modified in order to obtain the same runner temperature in both theory and experiment.
