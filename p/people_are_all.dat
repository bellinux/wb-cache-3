25|$|From about 1500 BC, bronze was {{gradually}} introduced, but {{the use of}} stone implements continued; Norway had few riches to barter for bronze goods, and the few finds consist mostly of elaborate weapons and brooches that only chieftains could afford. Huge burial cairns built close to the sea as far north as Harstad and also inland in the south are characteristic of this period. The motifs of the rock carvings differ from those typical of the Stone Age. Representations of the Sun, animals, trees, weapons, ships, and <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> strongly stylised.|$|E

Now the <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> right, but I just didn't like the town." [...] He also stated that it began to affect his {{performance}} on the mound, and that he began to get [...] "lazy" [...] from being with the club so long. He did, however, have praise for his catcher: [...] "The best thing that happened to me there was pitching to Steve O'Neill. He caught me for nine years in Cleveland and knew me so well he didn't even need to give me a sign".|$|E

500|$|Film analyst Lina Badley {{has written}} that the Alien's design, with strong Freudian sexual undertones, {{multiple}} phallic symbols, and overall feminine figure, provides an androgynous image conforming to archetypal mappings and imageries in horror films that often redraw gender lines. O'Bannon himself later described the sexual imagery in Alien as overt and intentional: [...] "One thing that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> disturbed about is sex... I said 'That's how I'm going to attack the audience; I'm going to attack them sexually. And I'm {{not going to go}} after the women in the audience, I'm going to attack the men. I am going to put in every image I can think of to make the men in the audience cross their legs. Homosexual oral rape, birth. The thing lays its eggs down your throat, the whole number.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Nobody Sees" [...] {{features}} the entire line-up of Powderfinger in {{shot in the}} dark at nighttime with the Melbourne cityscape in the background. The group's lead vocalist, Bernard Fanning, who in all previous recordings would play keyboards and piano parts, did not record any of these parts for Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, as these duties were fulfilled by Benmont Tench. Though Tench performed the keyboard in the recording of the song, Fanning appears at the keyboard in the music video. The scenes of the band playing are intercut with video shots of a do-it-yourself carwash, and five shots of people by themselves. These <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> initially shown being still then as the video progresses, the people are shown performing highly energetic actions in slow motion. The actions shown include running, falling and jumping. There are instances through Ian Haug's guitar solo where John Collins' bass guitar and Darren Middleton's electric guitar are also shown in close-up and slow motion.|$|E
500|$|Research by the Centre for Tropical Urban and Regional Planning at James Cook University has {{concluded}} that Palm Island has most of the resources {{it needs to be}} largely self-sufficient through housing, agriculture and tourism. [...] However Barry Moyle the Chief Executive Officer of the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council and former Mayor of Johnstone Shire Council suggests that the tourism potential of the island is hindered by the negative reputation that Palm Island is considered to have. [...] Moyle asserts that once potential tourists get past that negative image [...] "they will find really nice and beautiful people, with a rich culture, living on this untouched tropical gem of North Queensland". [...] Further, according to Moyle, [...] "it could be considered a big ask that people will get past the perception that the <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> no-hoper alcoholics and perpetrators of domestic violence, which is considered to be the general reputation that Palm Islanders have in broader Australia. [...] Locals say that there are bad eggs, but that is the same in all communities." ...|$|E

[...] An uncomfortable Ben tells Leslie they should tell her about their relationship, but Leslie {{does not want to}} lose the bubble. [...] Fed up, Ben storms into Marlene's office and tells her that he is dating her daughter and asks her to keep it secret. [...] Marlene laughs off the situation and tells Leslie that she approves of Ben. [...] Meanwhile, Ron tells Chris the changes do not play to his staff's strengths because Jerry only does well in the background, Tom only does well if <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> aware of his activities, and April only does well if people leave her the hell alone. Chris takes in Ron's well-reasoned arguments and they cut a deal where Chris will return everything to the way it was after Ron does one more week of interacting with the public. Nevertheless, Tom is frustrated with the experience and begins to contemplate leaving his city hall job to pursue his own entrepreneurial interests.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a simple}} example, suppose that a set [...] of <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> seeking jobs from among {{a set of}} [...] jobs, with not all people {{suitable}} for all jobs. This situation can be modeled as a bipartite graph [...] where an edge connects each job-seeker with each suitable job. A perfect matching describes a way of simultaneously satisfying all job-seekers and filling all jobs; Hall's marriage theorem provides a characterization of the bipartite graphs which allow perfect matchings. The National Resident Matching Program applies graph matching methods {{to solve this problem}} for U.S. medical student job-seekers and hospital residency jobs.|$|E
2500|$|Starkweather taught Fugate how to drive, {{and one day}} she crashed his 1949 Ford {{into another}} car. Starkweather's father paid the damages, as he {{was the owner of}} the vehicle. This caused an altercation between Starkweather and his father. Refusing to condone his son's behavior, he banished his son from the family home. Starkweather quit his job at the {{warehouse}} and became employed as a garbage collector for minimum wage. Starkweather began progressing towards his nihilistic views on life, believing that his current situation was the final determinant of how he would live the rest of his life. He used the garbage route to begin plotting bank robberies and finally conceived his own personal philosophy by which he lived the remainder of his life: [...] "Dead <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> on the same level".|$|E

2500|$|Even worse is the {{portrayal}} of the Japanese in American Propaganda. [...] Though the way the Germans are shown to be might be considered offensive, the attacks are generally focused on Nazi officials such as Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels, and Göring. [...] On the other hand, the Japanese are targeted on a much broader level. [...] These range from showing the Japanese as being vicious and feral, as {{on the cover of}} Marvel Comic's Mystery Comics no. 32, to using every horrific stereotype available. [...] This is the case in the Loony Tune's cartoon Tokio Jokio (aired May 13, 1943), in which the Japanese <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> shown to be incredibly stupid (such as one man using an incendiary bomb to roast a hot dog over), obsessed with being polite, cowardly, and physically [...] short with buckteeth, big lips, squinty eyes, and glasses. [...] The entire cartoon is also narrated in broken English, with the letter [...] "R" [...] often replacing [...] "L" [...] in pronunciation of words, a common stereotype. [...] Slurs used against Japanese were common as well. [...] In the Popeye cartoon Scrap the Japs (aired November 20, 1942), Popeye at one point exclaims [...] "I never seen a Jap that wasn't yella!" [...] In Nip the Nips, a Bugs Bunny cartoon first aired on April 22, 1944, Bugs passes out explosives disguised as ice cream to a number of Japanese soldiers, referring to them individually as, [...] "bow legs," [...] "monkey face," [...] and [...] "slanty eyes." [...] Perhaps nowhere is the difference in portrayals more solidly seen than in Theodor Geisel's comics created during the Second World War. [...] Hitler may be seen as weak, cowardly, and ineffective, but Hideki Tojo and Emperor Hirohito are always shown to have the same physical stereotypes already discussed.|$|E
