5000|$|Quevedo {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agricultural centers of Ecuador and is the geographical point where all major roads (including the Pan-American highway) in the region intersect. The area surrounding Quevedo mainly produce bananas, corn, rice, and soybeans. The alluvial soils in the region generate excellent harvests year-round. Many banana producers complement their banana plantations with fields that produce corn, soy and rice in the wet season. In the city, this produce is often industrialized into super-market ready products, such as instant-meals, <b>pre-packaged</b> <b>products,</b> noodles and other traditionally Asian foods. In recent years, Quevedo agro-industrial complex has added value to its output by developing a strong presence in the organic product's niche both locally and overseas.|$|R

40|$|Packaging plays a very {{important}} role in influencing purchase decision. Globalization and development of technology accompanied with change in life style has made packaging an important and fundamental element in retail business. This study was carried out to determine the role of packaging in influencing purchase decision or <b>pre-packaged</b> food <b>products.</b> A descriptive cross- sectional survey was conducted in Dar es Salaam, from July to August, 2013. A questionnaire was used to collect information on the role of food packaging in influencing consumer purchase decision from 286 consumers intercepted after they had purchased <b>pre-packaged</b> food <b>products</b> in Shoprite supermarket located at Mlimani city mall. The collected data were analysed to assess the role of both the visual and informational elements of packaging on purchasing decision of pre-packaged food items and whether this role was different across selected variables such the buyer’s age, gender, income level, education level, and household size. The results show that both food packaging elements play a role in influencing purchase decision and that the informational elements are relatively more important. There results further show significant differences in the role played by food packaging across consumer’s income level and household size. Thus, it is recommended that food manufacturer should incorporate packaging in their marketing strategy and should consider varying them across different class of people in terms of income level and household size. Regulatory bodies should consider strengthening enforcement measures on the quality of packaging. ...|$|R

This push has seen many Australian universities develop international strategies to offer teaching programs and courses globally. The tyranny of distance in global course offerings has provided a variety of challenges for universities that enter the international arena. In addition {{to the quality of the}} programs being delivered, one of the concerns or objectives when the same subject is taught across various teaching locations and modes is to maintain uniformity in the standard of delivery and assessment. The study examines student performance (measured by academic grades) of four different student cohorts located in Australia and South-East Asia (Malaysia and Singapore) studying an introductory accounting subject offered by Monash University.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of diet induced {{diseases such as}} cancer, high blood pressure, stroke, cardiovascular/heart disease, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis and malnutrition are rampant in our world today and therefore topical. The practice of nutritional labeling is being advocated as a panacea for this malaise and hence a sizeable number of researches are being undertaken in this direction. Large chunk of these studies are concentrated in the advanced countries. Unfortunately, there is dearth of such studies in developing countries including Nigeria. Consequently, this study sought to empirically determine consumers’ reaction to nutritional labeling of <b>pre-packaged</b> food <b>products</b> in Nigeria. The study was purely descriptive and data collected aptly analyzed through the instrumentality of pertinent statistical tools. Findings show that consumers read, comprehend, trust the authenticity and are significantly aware of nutritional labeling {{and are able to}} relate the effects of nutrition information to their health. Not surprising therefore, consumers consciously search for nutrition information, which significantly influence their purchase decisions of these kinds of products. These results hold some implications for both policy-makers and pre-packaged food marketers. Further research should be in areas of quantity and position of disclosure of nutrition information and use of symbols in nutritional labeling in Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on place branding {{has shown that}} the tourism industry is a critical component of the brand equity of places. The growing attention on place branding generated by the evolution of tourists’ behaviour and competition between countries, regions and cities brought out the need of a new strategic approach for tourism organizations. One of the main avenues through which tourism organizations develop the competitiveness of a place, and hence its equity, is service bundling, a practice which is gaining popularity in the tourism industry. Nowadays tourism products are predominantly product-and-service bundles, and customers can choose their favourite solution along a continuum with two extremes: entirely <b>pre-packaged</b> tourism <b>products</b> on one side and completely individual arrangements on the other side (Zins, 1998). Cooperation in tourism destination management is key to create effective service bundling. Dickinson and Ramaseshan (2004, 2008) observe that the tourism industry performance is positively and significantly influenced by cooperation among operators, and that has a positive impact on the brand image of a destination. Therefore brand image of a place is positively influenced by cooperation, which helps the destination in being perceived as unique and well-connected. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to shed light on the role of collaboration among tourism operators in place branding. Our research is focused on hoteliers, who represent a reference point for tourists, and hence a critical player in the tourism industry. Thanks to their close contact with customers, they can be the initiators or promoters of potential partnerships. We investigate the impact of benefits (economic and non-economic) achievable through service bundling on hoteliers’ orientation to networking, i. e. their willingness to collaborate with other organizations such as restaurants, theme parks, spas, etc. We want to test whether the perception of higher benefits through service bundling increases hoteliers’ propensity to cooperate. We interviewed a sample of 164 hoteliers located in Aosta Valley, a small Italian region which has been involved for a long time in promoting its destination as a brand. The main result is that trust in other touristic operators mediates the impact of relational benefits on networking orientation. Another interesting result is the significant impact of operators’ innovativeness, which mediates the relationship between economic benefits and networking orientation...|$|R

The shop specialised in imported products including wines, biscuits, canned food and beverages. Wellcome was the first supermarket to establish a Home Delivery Service division, and an average of 600 customers enjoyed this one-of-a-kind service through orders in person daily. Wellcome was acquired by Dairy Farm in 1964. The company {{was the first to}} introduce a [...] "self-service" [...] retailing concept. Customers no longer require the assistance of service staff to get products; they have to select products from the shelf. Wellcome was the first to offer <b>pre-packaged</b> rice <b>products</b> in 1973. In the 1980s, Wellcome launched its first corporate brand [...] "No Frills", offering customers over 300 products at the lowest prices as compared to other products in the same category. Later, Wellcome became the first supermarket to employ Electronic data interchange (EDI) technology to improve the efficiency of operation. Wellcome expanded to Taiwan and acquired Ding Hao supermarket. Wellcome opened its first 24-hour store in Great George Street, Causeway Bay on 23 October 1998. Wellcome established its second corporate brand, First Choice, with a product range of over 1,000 items. With prices at 20-30% less than competitive international brands, it is a well-known brand in Hong Kong. A HK$400 million investment, [...] "Wellcome Fresh Food Centre" [...] was opened in 1998, occupying an area of 161,000 sq. ft.

According to the report of 2004-2008, Wellcome supermarkets and thus increase the number of branches. Wellcome introduced the [...] "Vote For Your Favourite Brand" [...] campaign in 2000 and soon opened a superstore at Tuen Mun Town Plaza. The Wellcome superstore introduced a new [...] "one-stop" [...] shopping service, embracing the concepts of both wet market and grocery shop under one roof. Wellcome also began its double refund offer with lowest price guarantee by doubling the difference back to customers. Wellcome unveiled its Stanley store in January 2003. It is the first supermarket located inside a 100-year-old historical building - the old Stanley Police Station. In 2014, Wellcome Taiwan was found to have used contaminated ingredients in its mushroom and minced pork seasonings, drawing it into the 2014 Taiwan food scandal.|$|R
40|$|Our {{wellbeing}} {{depends upon}} the services provided by ecosystems and their components. Despite recent advances in academic understanding of ecosystem services, and consideration in UK national environmental policy, a greater awareness is needed at community and individual levels. Dynamic features of virtual globe applications have considerable potential for helping convey the multi-dimensional context of ecosystem services and promoting general awareness. In a case study targeting residents in a small urban fringe river catchment in Norfolk, UK, representatives from local authorities and responsible agencies collaborated with scientists to produce extensive customisation of virtual globes in this context. By implementing a virtual flight over the catchment, different views and scales are traversed to set the context for landscape features and ecosystem services. Characteristic sites, e. g. supplying cultural services, are displayed and relationships with the natural environment are explained using linked on-screen text. Implementation is cost-effective and described for practitioners in ecosystem and landscape management, who may be inexperienced in landscape visualisation. Supplied as three <b>pre-packaged</b> virtual tours, <b>products</b> are made available for download and are publicised {{at a variety of}} engagement events, including teaching events with schoolchildren. The tours have attracted public interest and generated positive feedback about improving knowledge of local natural assets. Schoolchildren show confidence with the interface, but supplementary problem-based activities can improve learning opportunities. The capacity of virtual globes to support more participatory involvement of the public in local ecosystem management may increase in the future, but such visualisations can already help promote community awareness of local landscape benefits...|$|R
