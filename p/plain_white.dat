5|$|In 1888, Darlington's kit {{consisted}} of a shirt with black and white vertical stripes, black shorts and black socks. Apart from a period between the 1910s and 1936, when blue shorts were worn, the basic colours of the home kit have remained black and white. The shirt design has varied, from the 1888 vertical stripes, through hoops, <b>plain</b> <b>white,</b> and back to hoops again in the 1990s. Sponsors' names have appeared on Darlington's shirts since the 1980s. A table of kit manufacturers (since the 1970s) and shirt sponsors appears on the right.|$|E
5|$|Tom Pryce's helmet design was, in {{comparison}} to later drivers', simple and restrained. His helmet was <b>plain</b> <b>white</b> all over until 1970. At that year's race at Castle Combe, his father asked Pryce to make his helmet stand out more {{so that he could}} easily identify him in a pack of cars. Pryce added five black vertical lines to his helmet, placed just above his visor. From that time the only change to this design was the addition of a Welsh flag to the side of his helmet in 1974.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 {{the station}} {{underwent}} a major modernisation, removing the murals {{installed on the}} Central and Bakerloo line platforms in the 1980s and replacing them with <b>plain</b> <b>white</b> tiles, in a style {{similar to those used}} when the station opened in 1900. One 1980s mural remains on one of the platforms. The Central line platform works were substantially complete and a new Station Operations Room at top level opened. This enabled the entire CCTV system to be switched over to new recordable digital technology. The original motifs designed by Hans Unger on the Victoria line platforms were restored.|$|E

5|$|In {{the times}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795), a banner of the Commonwealth was also used, {{combining}} the heraldic symbols of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Commonwealth banner was initially <b>plain</b> <b>white</b> emblazoned with {{the arms of the}} Commonwealth which consisted of the heraldic charges of Poland (White Eagle) and Lithuania (Pursuer). Since both Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms consisted of white (Argent) charges in a red (Gules) field, these two colors started to be used for the entire banner. During the 17th century, the banner was usually divided into two, three or four horizontal, often swallow-tailed, stripes of red and white.|$|E
5|$|Live'r Than You'll Ever Be is a bootleg {{recording}} of the Rolling Stones' concert in Oakland, California, from 9 November 1969. It {{was one of the}} first live rock music bootlegs and was made notorious as a document of their 1969 tour of the United States. The popularity of the bootleg forced the Stones' label Decca Records to release the live album Get Yer Ya-Yas Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert in 1970. Live'r is also one of the earliest commercial bootleg recordings in rock history, released in December 1969, just two months after the Beatles' Kum Back and five months after Bob Dylan's Great White Wonder. Like the two earlier records, Live'rs outer sleeve is <b>plain</b> <b>white,</b> with its name stamped on in ink.|$|E

The Westchester helped to re-establish <b>White</b> <b>Plains</b> as Westchester County's shopping mecca, following the decline of White Plains' two older malls, the <b>White</b> <b>Plains</b> Mall and The Galleria at <b>White</b> <b>Plains.</b> The city's property taxes were not raised during his four-year tenure.|$|R
5|$|Apart from Bank, {{which was}} {{completely}} below ground, all stations had buildings designed by Harry Bell Measures. They were single-storey structures {{to allow for}} future commercial development above and had elevations faced in beige terracotta. Each station had lifts manufactured by the Sprague Electric Company in New York. The lifts were provided {{in a variety of}} sizes and configurations to suit the passenger flow at each station. Generally they operated in sets of two or three in a shared shaft. Station tunnel walls were finished in <b>plain</b> <b>white</b> ceramic tiles and lit by electric arc lamps. The electricity to run the trains and the stations was supplied from the power station at Wood Lane at 5,000V AC which was converted at sub-stations along the route to 550V DC to power the trains via a third rail system.|$|E
5|$|In 1725 the Qing Yongzheng Emperor {{bestowed}} the hereditary {{title of}} Marquis on {{a descendant of}} the Ming dynasty Imperial family, Zhu Zhilian (朱之璉), who received a salary from the Qing government and whose duty was to perform rituals at the Ming tombs, and was also inducted the Chinese <b>Plain</b> <b>White</b> Banner in the Eight Banners. Later the Qianlong Emperor bestowed the title Marquis of Extended Grace posthumously on Zhu Zhilian in 1750, and the title passed on through twelve generations of Ming descendants {{until the end of}} the Qing dynasty in 1912. The last Marquis of Extended Grance was Zhu Yuxun (朱煜勳). In 1912, after the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution, some advocated that a Han Chinese be installed as Emperor, either the descendant of Confucius, who was the Duke Yansheng, or the Ming dynasty Imperial family descendant, the Marquis of Extended Grace.|$|E
5|$|Other {{characters}} in the Arthurian legends are described with coats of arms. Lancelot starts with <b>plain</b> <b>white</b> arms but later receives a shield with three bends gules signifying the strength of three men (Brault 47). Tristran was attributed a variety of arms. His earliest arms, a gold lion rampant on red field, are shown {{in a set of}} 13th-century tiles found in Chertsey Abbey (Loomis 1915, 308). Thomas of Britain in the 12th century attributed these arms (Loomis 1938, 47) in what is believed to be heraldic flattery of his patron, either Richard I or Henry II, whose coats of arms contained some form of lion (Loomis 1922, 26). In other versions the field is not red, but green. Gottfried von Strassburg attributed to Tristan a silver shield with a black boar rampant (Loomis 1922, 24; Loomis 1938, 49). In Italy, however, he was attributed geometric patterns (argent a bend gules per Loomis 1938, 59).|$|E
5|$|Once <b>White</b> <b>Plains</b> {{became the}} county seat of Westchester in 1759, the road between this village {{and the city of}} New York (then {{encompassing}} only Manhattan) became an important route and was established as the <b>White</b> <b>Plains</b> Post Road. Before 1797, the main road heading to points north and east out of Manhattan went via Kingsbridge along the old Boston Post Road. A new bridge over the Harlem River (the original Harlem Bridge) was opened in 1797, shortening the route out of Manhattan. This also relocated the Boston and <b>White</b> <b>Plains</b> Post roads to a new alignment along Third Avenue and Boston Road. The <b>White</b> <b>Plains</b> Post Road separated from the Boston Post Road in Bronxdale, with the road to Boston heading east and the road to <b>White</b> <b>Plains</b> heading north. The old <b>White</b> <b>Plains</b> Post Road roughly followed the alignment of modern-day <b>White</b> <b>Plains</b> Road, which was laid out in 1863. (The original post road was to the east of the modern-day avenue). The <b>White</b> <b>Plains</b> Post Road continued north through Olinville, Wakefield, and Mount Vernon, where the route shifted east to modern-day <b>White</b> <b>Plains</b> Post Road, going through Bronxville and Scarsdale to <b>White</b> <b>Plains.</b>|$|R

5|$|With the {{establishment}} of a dynastic union with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1386, it became customary to use two bannersPolish and Lithuanianas equally important insignia of royal authority. In the mid-16th century, before the creation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (real union) in 1569, a single banner for the entire entity also came into use. The Commonwealth banner was initially <b>plain</b> <b>white</b> emblazoned with the arms of the Commonwealth which combined the heraldic charges of Poland (White Eagle) and Lithuania (Pursuer). During the 17th century, the banner was often divided into three or four horizontal stripes of white and red, ending with swallowtails. Elective kings' dynastic arms were often placed in an inescutcheon. Variants with the White Eagle and the Pursuer placed side by side without an escutcheon directly in the field or with the Eagle on the obverse and the Pursuit on the reverse side of the banner were also used.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1991 season, Zerex {{ended their}} {{sponsorship}} of Kulwicki's team. Junior Johnson came calling again, {{looking for a}} driver for his revived second team that had last seen Neil Bonnett behind the wheel in 1986. Kulwicki turned down Johnson's $1 million offer thinking that he had secured a sponsorship deal with Maxwell House Coffee. Johnson then went to Maxwell House himself and obtained the sponsorship for his new car, which Sterling Marlin was hired to drive instead. Kulwicki was forced to begin the season without a sponsor, paying all of the team's expenses {{out of his own}} pocket. At the opening race of the season, the 1991 Daytona 500, fivecars raced with paint schemes representing different branches of the United States military to show support for the American forces involved in the Gulf War. It was the first use of special paint schemes in NASCAR history. Kulwicki's car was sponsored by the United States Army in a one-race deal. After running the second and third races of the season in a <b>plain</b> <b>white</b> unsponsored car, Kulwicki's luck finding a sponsor changed for the better at Atlanta Motor Speedway.|$|E
5|$|The first popular {{rock music}} bootleg {{resulted}} from Bob Dylan's activities between largely disappearing {{from the public}} eye after his motorcycle accident in 1966, {{and the release of}} John Wesley Harding at the end of 1967. After a number of artists had hits with Dylan songs that he had not officially recorded and released himself, demand increased for these recordings, particularly when they started airing on local radio in Los Angeles. Through various contacts in the radio industry, a number of pioneering bootleggers managed to buy a reel to reel tape containing a selection of unreleased Dylan songs intended for distribution for music publishers and wondered if {{it would be possible to}} manufacture them on an LP. They managed to convince a local pressing plant to press between 1,000 and 2,000 copies discreetly, paying in cash and avoiding using real names or addresses. Since the bootleggers could not commercially print a sleeve, due to it attracting too much attention from recording companies, the LP was issued in a <b>plain</b> <b>white</b> cover with Great White Wonder rubber stamped on it. Subsequently, Dylan became one of the most popular artists to be bootlegged with numerous releases.|$|E
