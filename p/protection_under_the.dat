5|$|Proponents of the Act, {{including}} Trumbull and Wilson, {{argued that}} Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment authorized {{the federal government}} to legislate civil rights for the States.

Seeking more substantial justification, and fearing that future opponents would again seek to overturn the legislation, Congress and the states added additional protections to the Constitution: the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) defining citizenship and mandating equal <b>protection</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law, and the Fifteenth Amendment (1870) banning racial voting restrictions.|$|E

In 1987, the USFWS removed the animal from the endangered species list, as it was considered to be fully recovered.

5|$|Frederick grew {{up during}} a tumultuous {{political}} period as {{the concept of}} liberalism in Germany, which evolved during the 1840s, was gaining widespread and enthusiastic support. The liberals sought a unified Germany and were constitutional monarchists who desired a constitution to ensure equal <b>protection</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law, the protection of property, and the safeguarding of basic civil rights. Overall, the liberals desired a government ruled by popular representation. When Frederick was 17, these emergent nationalistic and liberal sentiments sparked a series of political uprisings across the German states and elsewhere in Europe. In Germany, their goal was to protect freedoms, such as the freedom of assembly and freedom of the press, {{and to create a}} German parliament and constitution. Although the uprisings ultimately brought about no lasting changes, liberal sentiments remained an influential force in German politics throughout Frederick's life.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of the millions of black former slaves. By 1869, amendments had been passed to abolish slavery and provide citizenship and equal <b>protection</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> laws, but the election of Ulysses S. Grant to the presidency in 1868 convinced a majority of Republicans that protecting the franchise of black male voters was important for the party's future. On February 26, 1869, after rejecting more sweeping versions of a suffrage amendment, Congress proposed a compromise amendment banning franchise restrictions on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude. After surviving a difficult ratification fight, the amendment was certified as duly ratified and part of the Constitution on March 30, 1870.|$|E

5|$|Myriostoma is a fungal genus in {{the family}} Geastraceae. The genus is monotypic, {{containing}} the single species Myriostoma coliforme. It is an earthstar, so named because the spore-bearing sack's outer wall splits open {{into the shape of}} a star. The inedible fungus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and has been found in Africa, Asia, North and South America, and Europe, where it grows in humus-rich forests or in woodlands, especially on well-drained and sandy soils. A somewhat rare fungus, it appears on the Red Lists of 12 European countries, and in 2004 it was one of 33 species proposed for <b>protection</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Bern Convention by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and feeds on carrion, {{but will also}} eat eggs or kill newborn animals. In areas populated by humans, it also feeds at garbage dumps. It finds its meals either by using its keen eyesight or by following other (New World) vultures, which possess {{a keen sense of}} smell. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It lays its eggs in caves or hollow trees or on the bare ground, and generally raises two chicks each year, which it feeds by regurgitation. In the United States, the vulture receives legal <b>protection</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. This vulture also appeared in Mayan codices.|$|E
5|$|The list of {{threatened}} fauna of Michigan includes almost 400 endangered, threatened and special concern {{species that are}} located in Michigan {{as a part of}} the fauna of the United States. Endangered and threatened species in Michigan are protected through the Endangered Species Act of the State of Michigan, part of the 1994 Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act. The list was last updated in 2009 to its sixth iteration. At this time, 69 new species were added, including many species of freshwater mussels and snails, and 13 species were removed. The state also recognizes species of special concern, which are not protected under the Act. These species have low or declining numbers in the state or a need for additional information on their populations in Michigan. If the species' numbers decline, they are moved to threatened or endangered status and afforded <b>protection</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Act; if they increase, they are removed from the list without further action.|$|E
