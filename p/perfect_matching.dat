25|$|A <b>perfect</b> <b>{{matching}}</b> (a.k.a. 1-factor) is {{a matching}} which matches all vertices of the graph. That is, every vertex of the graph is incident to exactly one {{edge of the}} matching. Figure (b) above {{is an example of}} a <b>perfect</b> <b>matching.</b> Every <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> is maximum and hence maximal. In some literature, the term complete matching is used. In the above figure, only part (b) shows a <b>perfect</b> <b>matching.</b> A <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> is also a minimum-size edge cover. Thus, , that is, the size of a maximum matching is no larger than the size of a minimum edge cover.|$|E

25|$|The graphs {{of several}} polyhedra and polytopes are claw-free, {{including}} {{the graph of}} the tetrahedron and more generally of any simplex (a complete graph), the graph of the octahedron and more generally of any cross polytope (isomorphic to the cocktail party graph formed by removing a <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> from a complete graph), the graph of the regular icosahedron, and the graph of the 16-cell.|$|E
25|$|In graph theory, {{a branch}} of mathematics, a crown graph on 2n {{vertices}} is an undirected graph with two sets of vertices u'i and v'i and with an edge from u'i to v'j whenever i≠j. The crown graph {{can be viewed as}} a complete bipartite graph from which the edges of a <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> have been removed, as the bipartite double cover of a complete graph, as the tensor product K'n × K'2, as the complement of the Cartesian direct product of K'n and K'2, or as a bipartite Kneser graph H'n,1 representing the 1-item and (n1)-item subsets of an n-item set, with an edge between two subsets whenever one is contained in the other.|$|E
25|$|Sumner's proof shows, more strongly, {{that in any}} {{connected}} claw-free graph one {{can find}} a pair of adjacent vertices the removal of which leaves the remaining graph connected. To show this, Sumner finds a pair of vertices u and v that are as far apart {{as possible in the}} graph, and chooses w to be a neighbor of v that is as far from u as possible; as he shows, neither v nor w can lie on any shortest path from any other node to u, so the removal of v and w leaves the remaining graph connected. Repeatedly removing matched pairs of vertices in this way forms a <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> in the given claw-free graph.|$|E

50|$|Are You the One? is an American reality {{television}} series on MTV. It follows 20 {{people who are}} living together in a tropical destination to find their <b>perfect</b> <b>match.</b> The definition of a <b>perfect</b> <b>match</b> is not known or published. If the 10 men and 10 women are able to correctly choose all ten <b>perfect</b> <b>matches</b> in ten weeks, they will win $1 million to split among them. Each episode the cast will pair up with whoever they believe their <b>perfect</b> <b>match</b> is {{to compete in a}} challenge.

The cast members will choose one of the winning couples to go to the truth booth to determine if they are a <b>perfect</b> <b>match</b> or not. This {{is the only way to}} confirm matches. Each episode ends with a matching ceremony where the couples will be told how many <b>perfect</b> <b>matches</b> they have, but not which matches are correct. Five of the couples are still together, including season 1's Ethan Diamond and Amber Lee, who are married and welcomed a daughter soon after their time on the show.|$|R

25|$|Several {{architectural}} elements {{have been}} represented with engraved signs. The parapet {{of the platform}} has been portrayed with a single or double row of incised triangles, or with vertical lines, similar to miniaturized nuraghes from other Sardinian sites, e.g. the high-relief from nuraghe Cann'e Vadosu and the nuraghe model from the meeting hut of Su Nuraxi in Barumini. Also the big slab-stones supporting the platforms have been rendered with decorative signs. The stone brackets and their function have been depicted by means of parallel incised lines or grooves and the blocks– abundantly found in archaeological sites {{after the collapse of}} top parts– confirm the <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> of these models with the Nuragic architecture of Middle and Recent Bronze Age.|$|E
25|$|Tait's {{motivation}} {{for studying the}} ménage problem came from {{trying to find a}} complete listing of mathematical knots with a given number of crossings, say n. In Dowker notation for knot diagrams, an early form of which was used by Tait, the 2n points where a knot crosses itself, in consecutive order along the knot, are labeled with the 2n numbers from 1 to 2n. In a reduced diagram, the two labels at a crossing cannot be consecutive, so the set of pairs of labels at each crossing, used in Dowker notation to represent the knot, can be interpreted as a <b>perfect</b> <b>matching</b> in a graph that has a vertex for every number in the range from 1 to 2n and an edge between every pair of numbers that has different parity and are non-consecutive modulo 2n. This graph is formed by removing a Hamiltonian cycle (connecting consecutive numbers) from a complete bipartite graph (connecting all pairs of numbers with different parity), and so it has a number of matchings equal to a ménage number. For alternating knots, this matching is enough to describe the knot diagram itself; for other knots, an additional positive or negative sign needs to be specified for each crossing pair to determine which of the two strands of the crossing lies above the other strand.|$|E
