5|$|All two-cent <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> minted at the Philadelphia Mint, {{and bore}} no mint mark. Proof mintages are estimated.|$|E
5|$|The gun was {{manufactured}} by Watervliet Arsenal and the carriage by Rock Island Arsenal. The first <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> delivered early in 1940, the production continued until 1943.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} where both <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> retrieved {{was found to}} be consistent with the drift model performed by CSIRO, further corroborating they could have come from Flight 370.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pieces</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} made in {{wood and}} sometimes in ivory. The height of the <b>pieces</b> <b>is</b> varied by class. The official colors of the <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> red and black.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> {{captured}} {{when two}} enemy <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> on adjacent sides of it, {{in a straight}} line. The player whose <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> captured must use his next turn to relocate the captured piece: ...|$|R
50|$|A <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> said {{to attack}} (or threaten) an opponent's piece if, {{in the next}} move, it could capture that <b>piece.</b> A <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> said to defend (or protect) {{a piece of the}} defender's color if, in case the defended <b>piece</b> <b>were</b> taken by the opponent, the defender could {{immediately}} recapture. Attacking a piece usually, but not always (see Sacrifice), forces the opponent to respond if the attacked <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> undefended, or if the attacking <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> of lower value than the one attacked.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1834, threepence (3d) <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> struck for {{circulation}}, {{bearing the}} same design as the Maundy 3d. The circulation <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> initially struck {{for use in}} the West Indies, but beginning in 1845, were coined for use in Britain as well. Many of the 3d pieces presented to impoverished Maundy recipients were spent, and these are rarer than the other values today. Maundy 3ds may sometimes be distinguished from currency 3ds as dies with a more polished field were used for the Maundy pieces. The design of the circulation 3d remained {{the same as that of}} the Maundy 3d until 1928, when a new design was introduced for the circulating coins. Twopence coins identical to Maundy pieces, intended for colonial use, were struck in 1838, 1843, and 1848.|$|E
5|$|Josquin {{wrote in}} all of the {{important}} forms current at the time, including masses, motets, chansons, and frottole. He even contributed {{to the development of a}} new form, the motet-chanson, of which he left at least three examples. In addition, some of his <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> probably intended for instrumental performance.|$|E
5|$|Monument23 {{was damaged}} in {{the mid-twentieth century}} by a local mason who {{attempted}} to break its exposed upper portion using a steel chisel. As a result, the top is fragmented, although the broken <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> recovered by archaeologists and have been put back into place.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The white <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> made of boxwood. The black <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> ebonized, not ebony.|$|R
50|$|There are a {{total of}} 12 pieces of which 6 <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> black and 6 <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> white.|$|R
5000|$|The five {{movements}} are tonally {{organized by the}} three notes in the D major triad: D, F-sharp, and A. The first, second, and fifth <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> in D major; the fourth <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> in F-sharp minor; and the third <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> in A major.|$|R
5|$|More of the {{octagonal}} $50 <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> sold {{than of the}} round, as {{the former}} proved more popular because of the association with the Gold Rush, and because people liked the dolphins. As half of the 3,000 authorized mintage for the $50 <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> of each variety, this meant more of the round ones would be melted, leaving the round $50 with the lowest distribution of any U.S. commemorative coin, about 483—the runner up being the octagonal with about 645, though sources vary on the exact numbers distributed.|$|E
5|$|Notes: 1,023 pieces melted. White {{metal and}} zinc pieces {{are known to}} have been struck. The zinc <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> {{allegedly}} fixed {{in the center of a}} target during the shooting festival. If hit, the shooter would be given a larger award.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the ceramic}} {{fragments}} recovered from Panorama Sector, 374 pieces have been dated to the Late Classic, representing 62% {{of the total}} ceramics found in the sector. The vast majority of these are domestic in nature. 234 <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> dated to the Terminal Classic, representing the remaining 38%.|$|E
50|$|Whichever {{player has}} more <b>pieces</b> <b>is</b> the winner (a Mandarin <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> equal to ten or five citizen pieces).|$|R
50|$|In Murray's variant, {{the pieces}} have {{different}} colors with different point values. The number of <b>pieces</b> per color <b>are</b> divided as follows: 1 green for every 2 red, for every 3 yellow, for every 4 white. In a 15 x 15 square board {{that would be}} 22 green, 45 red, 68 yellow, and 90 white <b>pieces.</b> Green <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 4 points, red <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 3 points, yellow <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 2 points, and white <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 1 point.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the players}} {{agree that they}} have no more moves they wish to (or CAN) make, points are scored based on the total pieces in the towers players control. Large <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 3 points, medium <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 2, and small <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> worth 1.|$|R
5|$|Second, Giáp made {{a mistake}} in Nà Sản by {{committing}} his forces to reckless frontal attacks before being fully prepared. He learned his lesson: at Điện Biên Phủ, Giáp spent months meticulously stockpiling ammunition and emplacing heavy artillery and antiaircraft guns before making his move. Teams of Viet Minh volunteers were sent into the French camp to scout the disposition of the French artillery. Wooden artillery <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> built as decoys and the real guns were rotated every few salvos to confuse French counterbattery fire. As a result, when the battle finally began, the Viet Minh knew exactly where the French artillery <b>pieces</b> <b>were,</b> while the French did not even know how many guns Giáp possessed.|$|E
5|$|After the French {{defeat at}} Waterloo, the works' former owners sought their return. The Louvre's administrators were loath to comply and hid many works {{in their private}} collections. In response, foreign states sent emissaries to London to seek help, and many <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> returned, even some that had been {{restored}} by the Louvre. In 1815 Louis XVIII finally concluded agreements with the Austrian government for the keeping of pieces such as Veronese's Wedding at Cana which was exchanged for a large Le Brun or the repurchase of the Albani collection.|$|E
5|$|Burial 68 {{was found}} in the centre of the Group 18 plaza. The corpse was poorly preserved, it was laid out on its back with the skull towards the north. The remains were covered with small pieces of {{limestone}} mixed with brown soil. A piece of the upper jaw indicated that the remains were those of a child aged between 5 and 10 years old. Four ceramic <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> deposited as an offering; two plates, an earthenware bowl and a bowl. Burial 68 is dated to the Late Preclassic.|$|E
5000|$|If {{a player}} can trap an enemy piece between two {{friendly}} pieces, the enemy <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> blocked and cannot be moved. Such a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> called alligatus or, according to Isidore, incitus. To {{make it clear}} that a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> an alligatus, it is turned upside down.|$|R
25|$|The two players' <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> usually colored red and black. <b>Pieces</b> <b>are</b> flat {{circular}} disks labeled or {{engraved with}} a Chinese character identifying the piece type, {{and in a}} color indicating which player has ownership. The black <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> marked with somewhat different characters from the corresponding red pieces.|$|R
50|$|Rook: Tank (pusher). Can move one {{square in}} any {{direction}} even if the square is currently occupied. If it moves into an occupied square it pushes against the other piece and forces it into the next square in the line. If {{there is more than}} one piece in a line, then the whole line of <b>pieces</b> <b>is</b> moved. If a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> moved off the board it is destroyed. If a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> moved into a coordinated field, it is destroyed. If a tank pushes against an immobilized field, then all immobilized <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> moved including the immobilizer (remember that only opponent <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> immobilized).|$|R
5|$|Christianity {{discouraged}} {{the burial}} of grave goods so {{the majority of}} examples of insular metalwork that survive from the Christian period {{have been found in}} archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned. There are a few exceptions, notably portable shrines ("cumdachs") for books or relics, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the Monymusk Reliquary has always been in Scotland. The highest quality survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, tableware or altarware. The finest church <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> probably made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> made by monastic workshops. There are a number of large brooches, each of their designs is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied. Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts. Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with amber and rock crystal among the commonest, and some garnets. Coloured glass, enamel and millefiori glass, probably imported, are also used. None of the major insular manuscripts, like the Book of Kells, have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers, but documentary evidence indicates that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples.|$|E
5|$|Coastal troop deployments, {{comprising}} five {{companies of}} infantry, were concentrated mostly at 15 strongpoints called Widerstandsnester ("resistance nests"), numbered WN-60 {{in the east}} to WN-74 near Vierville in the west, located primarily around the entrances to the draws and protected by minefields and wire. Positions within each strongpoint were interconnected by trenches and tunnels. As well as the basic weaponry of rifles and machine guns, more than 60 light artillery <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> deployed at these strongpoints. The heaviest <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> located in eight gun casemates and four open positions while the lighter guns were housed in 35 pillboxes. A further 18 anti-tank guns completed the disposition of artillery targeting the beach. Areas between the strongpoints were lightly manned with occasional trenches, rifle pits, and 85 machine-gun emplacements. No area of the beach was left uncovered, and the disposition of weapons meant that flanking fire could {{be brought to bear}} anywhere along the beach.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} May 2008 with {{preliminary}} land clearing. The first track <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> installed {{during the week}} of December 7, 2008. In February 2009, Universal launched a website for the attraction, which included a construction blog and photographs chronicling progress of the attraction's construction. The track layout was completed at the end of April 2009 with the crowning of the lift hill.|$|E
2500|$|Wooden White chess <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> {{normally}} {{made of a}} light wood, boxwood, {{or sometimes}} maple. Black wooden <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> made of a dark wood such as rosewood, ebony, red sandalwood, or walnut. Sometimes they are made of boxwood and stained or painted black, brown, or red. Plastic white <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> made of white or off-white plastic, and plastic black <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> made of black or red plastic. Sometimes other materials are used, such as bone, ivory, or a composite material [...]|$|R
5000|$|Ambuscade: If two pieces' sum {{is equal}} to an enemy <b>piece</b> that <b>is</b> placed between the two (i.e. the enemy <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> within a move of both attacking pieces), the enemy <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> {{captured}} and removed from the board.|$|R
50|$|A {{procedure}} for 3 partners and general <b>pieces</b> <b>was</b> found in 1960. A {{procedure for}} 3 partners and connected <b>pieces</b> <b>was</b> {{found only in}} 1980.|$|R
5|$|Dunne's {{bartender}} came to wider {{attention with}} the wartime columns, and the Dooley <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> soon in newspapers nationwide. Both the columns {{and the books}} collecting them gained national acclaim. Beginning around 1905, Dunne had increasing trouble finding time and inspiration for new columns, and they ended in 1915, except for a brief resurrection in the mid-1920s. Even in Dunne's own time (he died in 1936), his work was becoming obscure {{due in part to}} his use of dialect, and the unusual spellings that it used have proved a lasting barrier for potential readers.|$|E
5|$|Five $10 and one $50 polymer {{commemorative}} banknotes {{were made}} available from 20 August 2015. They {{are part of}} Singapore's Golden Jubilee (SG50) celebrations. 20 million <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> printed for the $50 commemorative SG50 banknote, while 15 million pieces of each $10 commemorative SG50 design banknote were printed. There was an oversupply of these SG50 banknotes; by February 2016 only about {{less than half of}} them were actually issued.|$|E
5|$|In 1593 {{there was}} a fresh crisis with Spain and the brass guns needed for the English navy were in short supply. Brass {{artillery}} <b>pieces</b> <b>were</b> therefore rounded up from the forts along the south coast, including Camber. The number of guns at the castle remained around the same, but the larger, brass culverins and demi-cannon were removed, being replaced with smaller iron demi-culverins, sakers and a minion. In 1594 another royal survey suggested that £95 of repair work was needed on the fortifications.|$|E
5000|$|The valuations of the {{partners}} are additive, i.e., when a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> divided, the sum of a <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> equal to {{the sum of its}} parts.|$|R
50|$|The {{game played}} with many <b>pieces</b> <b>is</b> a board with spaces {{disposed}} among lines: {{the board is}} called the “city” and each <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> called a “dog;” the <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> of two colors, {{and the art of}} the game consists in taking a piece of one color by enclosing it between two of the other color.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike other {{draughts}} variants, since <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> removed {{immediately after}} being jumped, as <b>pieces</b> <b>are</b> captured and removed, {{it is possible}} to cross a square previously occupied by a captured piece more than once in the same multicapture. (Since a captured <b>piece</b> <b>is</b> removed before the captor continues jumping, its removal may open up additional jumps previously impossible.) ...|$|R
