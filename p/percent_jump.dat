The {{objective of this}} study was to examine the effect of different pre-jump height exercises on two-legged vertical jump and to determine the best pre-jump height(s). Methods: Subjects included 35 females and 42 males. By matched randomized sampling, subjects of each sex were assigned into four groups, namely, control, 10 -cm hurdle, 20 -cm hurdle, and 30 -cm hurdle. They participated in the same training program for 6 weeks. Statistical analyses were based on one-way and repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Analysis of the data showed that practice over hurdles of 10 cm was better than no hurdle and hurdles of > 10 cm. Also, jump attempts over hurdles were efficient for trained athletes, but not for untrained athletes. For both sexes, the rate of spike improvement was much better in the experimental groups than in the control groups; it was independent from the rate of progress in jump, which was relatively less evident.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays that study three interdependent topics: microstructure foundation of volatility clustering, inefficiency of information diffusion and jump detection in high frequency financial time series data. Volatility clustering, with autocorrelations of the hyperbolic decay rate, is unquestionably {{one of the most}} important stylized facts of financial time series. The first essay forms Chapter 1 which presents a market microstructure model that is able to generate volatility clustering with hyperbolic autocorrelations through traders with multiple trading frequencies using Bayesian information updating in an incomplete market. The model illustrates that signal extraction, which is induced by multiple trading frequency, can increase the persistence of the volatility of returns. Furthermore, it is shown that the local temporal memory of the underlying time series of returns and their volatility varies greatly with the number of traders in the market. The second essay, Chapter 2, presents a market microstructure model showing that an increasing number of information hierarchies among informed competitive traders leads to a slower information diffusion rate and informational inefficiency. The model illustrates that informed traders may prefer trading with each other rather than with noise traders in the presence of the information hierarchies. Furthermore, it is shown that momentum can be generated from the trend following behavior pattern of noise traders. I propose a new nonparametric test based on wavelets to detect jump arrivals in high frequency financial time series data, in the third essay, Chapter 3. It is demonstrated that the test is robust for different specifications of price processes and the presence of market microstructure noise and it has good size and power. Further, I examine the multi-scale jump dynamics in U. S. equity markets and the findings are as follows. First, the jump dynamics of equities are entirely different across different time scales. Second, although arrival densities of positive jumps and negative jumps are symmetric across different time scales, the magnitude of jumps is distributed asymmetrically at high frequencies. Third, only twenty <b>percent</b> of <b>jumps</b> occur in the trading session from 9 : 30 AM to 4 : 00 PM, suggesting that jumps are largely determined by news rather than liquidity shocks...|$|R

This study aimed to investigate the effect of fatigue on ankle and knee joints and leg stiffness during a 30 -scontinuous vertical jump test. Methods: Fifteen female volleyball players without history of lower extremity injuries were selected in this study. They performed a 30 seconds vertical jump test and kinetics and kinematics data were measured using a force plate and two video cameras, respectively. Lower limb, stiffness before and after fatigue (first 10 <b>percent</b> of the <b>jump,</b> 10 % <b>percent</b> of the end jump) were compared using a paired samples t-test analysis. The amount of relationship between the height of the jump and leg, ankle and knee joints stiffness were measured by the use of Pearson test (P < 0 / 05). Results: Results showed a significant reduction in knee and ankle joints stiffness (pknee= 0. 00, pankle= 0. 004) and leg stiffness (p= 0. 01) during the test. In other words, fatigue decreases leg stiffness and ankle and knee joints stiffness by 20 %, 47 % and 34 %, respectively. It also decreases the jump height and ground reaction force. Conclusion: As the height of the jump and stiffness changes in lower body parts {{is an important factor in}} fields such as volleyball, coaches need to pay due attention to stiffness changes and improve their training techniques...|$|R
