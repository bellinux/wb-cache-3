Lastly, the medically certified sickness absences (MCSA) relative to 2010 were collected from the company database. A positive association emerged between workload and WHI, while there was no association between job autonomy and WHI. Moreover, a positive association emerged between WHI and psycho-physic strain.

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{recognized}} both by the scientific community and {{within the framework of}} social policies in Europe that the physical and psychosocial working environments pose potential risks for workers and organizational wellbeing. In particular psychosocial risks concern aspects of the design and management of work and its social and organizational contexts which have the potential for causing psychological or physical pro- blems. Objectives: This article examines the psychosocial risk factors of several types of Italian Public Administra- tion offices (municipal, provincial, regional, central government, university, police headquarters, chamber of com- merce, etc.) with the aim of obtaining a picture of the most problematic risk factors for each type. Methods: the par- ticipants of this survey consisted of about 23, 500 employees of different types of <b>Public</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>offices.</b> The Multidimensional Organizational Health Questionnaire (MOHQ, 3) was used to collect the data. Results and Conclusions: Results from ANOVA indicated that perceptions of fairness and job demands were the most proble- matic risk factors. Perception of safety at work was another problematic risk factor in specific types of work. The re- sults revealed a high perception of stress in all workers over the entire range of the <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>offices</b> stu- died...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Service Oriented Architecture {{paradigm}} {{promises to}} open and integrate <b>Public</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>offices</b> {{in order to provide}} highvalue e-services to citizens. Nevertheless to foster real usage of e-services by citizens, in majority still not fully acquainted with Internet technologies, it is necessary to put in place mechanisms to reduce as much as possible perceived system misbehavior. e-Services often handle personal and sensible data, therefore trust on the behavior of the system becomes of primary importance. In this paper, focusing on run-time composition of e-services, we provide an approach that reduces the possibility that the system will fail as consequence of interoperability issues among runtime discovered services, and after that sensible data have been provided by the citizen. The approach uses run-time testing to assess interoperability between services, and model-checking based techniques {{to reduce the number of}} test-cases to be applied. An exemplificative case-study is also illustrated and discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, {{document}} workflow management systems have been revised {{to take advantage of}} the possibilities introduced by new web technologies in terms of content management and workflow enactment. Moreover, in order to fully exploit the possibilities introduced by collaborative work and structured documents, the need for re-engineering the old workflow processes, traditionally based on atomic documents, has become evident and sometimes unanswered. The solution proposed in this work, has taken in consideration the needs for ease of deployment and workflow flexibility of small organizations, such as <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>offices,</b> which workflows are predominantly document driven. From the study of the theoretical aspects of document workflows, its constitutive elements and the current available solutions, this work has evolved with the devising of a new document centric workflow description language capable of describing the most common document-driven workflow patterns. The workflow description language has been thought to enable more sophisticated users to write the workflow description “by-hand” in order to fully exploit the potential of the solution proposed. To support the run-time execution of the described workflow, a language interpreter and a workflow engine have been developed. These two components are responsible for the management of the workflow instances, the interaction with workflow participants and the enforcement of correct routing of the documents...|$|R
