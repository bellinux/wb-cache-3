40|$|In {{his work}} Unities Denis Diderot {{hypothesised}} that objects arranged within a space reflect {{the perception of}} the self. He suggested that items within a room functioned as words within a syntax, each of them working together to form sentences, to tell a story: the biography of the resident. When one item is replaced by something new or different this biography is interrupted; Diderot utilised the example of his new red robe purchased with sudden and unexpected wealth, which, by benefit of its ‘newness’, makes everything else look shabby and old. The robe is indicative of Diderot’s new, prosperous life and is at odds with the items which highlight his previous life of poverty: ‘all is in discord…there is no unity, …This scarlet intruder in my home’, Diderot is <b>prompted</b> to <b>replace</b> the rest of the room’s contents so that the space is coherent and so that his biography is rewritten. Taking Diderot’s view of interior space as a starting point, this essay considers the layers of biography told to the visitor by the current display in the Dining Room at Tatton Park, Cheshire. Purchased in 1598 by Sir Thomas Egerton, the ‘Old Hall’ at Tatton underwent a series of rebuilds between 1760 and 1791. The result was a progression of modifications made to the interior and exterior space. Originally designated the Drawing Room, the space now known as the Dining Room was designed by Thomas Farnolls Pritchard for Samuel Egerton between 1760 and 1768. It was not until Samuel Wyatt’s alterations of 1785 - 88 that it became a dining room. The space is now dominated by a massive white marble fireplace, designed by Richard Westmacott and added in 1840. Subsequent members of the Egerton family added their marks; namely a mahogany dining suite (1812), electricity (1887) and Baccarat glassware (1911). Today the room, opened to the public by the National Trust in the 1960 ’s, is staged to display the results of 400 years of change including restored Rococo plasterwork, a sixteenth-century portrait of Sir Thomas Egerton the first owner of Tatton Park, green silk walls and floor-length scarlet velvet curtains (1960 s). The current arrangement of the Dining Room tries to represent generations of the Egertons, with historically disparate items sitting side by side. The constant interruption from these overlapping signifiers produces an incoherent syntax, a confusing biography. I shall identify the objects, or words, which are present within the space and consider the various life stories that are being put forward, and in turn, what they mean to the visitor, asking: whose story is really being told...|$|R

Biol. 49 (1994) 51 - 62]. Derivatives with an amide function in the side chain antagonized the stimulatory effect of estrogens both in vitro and in vivo, and showed no agonistic activity when given alone. The findings of other groups who studied steroidal antiestrogens <b>prompted</b> us to <b>replace</b> the amide function by sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone, sulfonamide and related groups. The compounds with polar sulfur functions retained the high binding affinity for the calf uterine estrogen receptor (RBA: 1 - 5 % of estradiol; ICI 182, 780; 6. 2 %). The estrogenic effect was quantified in a transcription assay using HeLa cells cotransfected with the expression vector HEG 0 for the human estrogen receptor and a reporter plasmid that harbored a Vit. A 2 ERE and the luciferase gene driven by a thymidine kinase promotor. Pentylsulfide, -sulfinyl, and -sulfonyl groups, linked to the indole nitrogen by a decamethylene spacer, were devoid of any transcriptional activity. These results were confirmed in the mouse uterine weight test. The sulfone (ZK 164, 015) completely abolished the effect of a standard dose of estrone at a daily dose of 7 mg/kg. This compound strongly inhibited the growth of hormone-sensitive human MCF- 7 breast cancer cells with an IC 50 -value close to 1 nM.

40|$|Workshop 1. Session 1. 2 : Segregation and {{strategies}} of gating and withdrawal. Abstract: Over the years, implicitly or explicitly {{the relationship between}} spatial form and the social world has been recurrently discussed in urban studies. Recently, this topic again gained relevance through the emerging critical debate on the social consequences of 9 ̆ 1 gated communities 9 ̆ 2. In this debate, more often than not, gated communities receive a very bad press. With reference to cities like Los Angeles, Sao Paolo, Johannesburg and Istanbul {{it is argued that}} walls and gates create exclusionary spaces that physically separate the haves from the have-nots. The lucky ones can retreat in their own spatial worlds, leaving less fortunate urban citizens behind. Spatial form thus functions to maintain and enhance social-economic inequality. On top of this, it is argued that the resulting physical separation of social groups undermines the public sphere. After all, groups that don 9 ̆ 2 t meet won 9 ̆ 2 t know and understand each other. So, the conditions for cross-social community, solidarity and maybe even democracy are under attack. We ascertain that this critical interpretation of 9 ̆ 1 splintering urbanism 9 ̆ 2 presupposes that a specific spatial form (gated enclaves) leads to specific social consequences (e. g. lack of community and solidarity) that especially hurt the disadvantaged. On theoretical grounds, we question such an elitist and spatial deterministic approach. And we <b>prompt</b> researchers to <b>replace</b> ideological reasoning on gating by precise empirical analysis of social life within gated urban fields. This paper presents a first discussion of such research conducted in Bangkok. In this Asian metropolis, not only the rich, but also the poor live behind gates. At the same time, the relational networks of inhabitants of various neighbourhoods within this splintered urban field turn out to leave space for cross-cultural encounters. However, we show that this doesn 9 ̆ 2 t necessitate understanding and solidarity...|$|R
