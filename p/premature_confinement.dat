40|$|Salmo (trutta) marmoratus is an endemic specie in the North of Italy, {{subjected}} to hybridization with domesticated strains of trout. Native populations are managed by supportive release in the rivers. Wild breeders are captured, confined in facility {{for short periods}} and then released in the river after artificial fertilization. <b>Premature</b> mortality during <b>confinement</b> and post release mortality in river have been observed in breeders supporting the view that confinement stress could be the cause. Twenty-six adult individuals of trout were captured from a river by electrofishing and stocked in two tanks, the first one (RF) provided with artificial refuges to simulate the natural environment and covered by dark panels; the second tank (TR) was only partially covered by dark panels and without artificial refuges. All the other conditions were identical and animals were fed ad libitum with natural food collected in the same river. After 50 days, from a third group of 8 trout (WD) captured in the same river by a 5 minute electrofish-ing session, blood samples were sequentially collected {{for the assessment of}} serum cortisol response to serial repeated handlings. With the same sequential method, individuals of the RF and TR experimental groups were sampled. Cortisol levels were compared between groups by ANOVA. Biomass densities decreased during the experiment due to premature mortality of the largest individuals in both the R...|$|R
