To maintain this perception, <b>police</b> <b>chiefs</b> work both officially and covertly within governmental structures and the public sphere to control how people think about their personnel and department.

Nuevo Laredo has been the battleground among Mexico's drug trafficking organizations given its proximity to the U.SMexico border and Interstate 35, a lucrative route {{where most of the}} cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine that reaches the United States are smuggled through. In May 2012, alleged organized crime members left the headless corpses of 14 men inside a vehicle near the Nuevo Laredo city hall. Alongside the corpses was a written message reportedly from the Sinaloa Cartel that accused Galván and other city officials of working for Los Zetas (such accusations between gangsters and local officials are common in Mexico). In June 2012, a car bomb detonated outside the Nuevo Laredo city hall at Galván's parking area, injuring several bystanders.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from December 16, 2015 - December 16, 2017 The purpose of this multi-case {{study was to explore}} the stories and lived experiences of Native American <b>police</b> <b>chiefs</b> who have faced the systemic conflicts and challenges created between Native American tribal policing and an opposing U. S. legal system. It sought to understand the essence of tribal police chiefs’ experiences in working within the U. S. legal system and the extent of conflict that has been created for them. It further sought to examine how tribal <b>police</b> <b>chiefs</b> navigate and provide effective leadership as they work to maintain tribal culture, traditions, and sovereignty within their departments. This research is of significance because there has been a lack of research directed toward developing tribal police leadership programs that assist <b>police</b> <b>chiefs</b> in navigating through a conflicting and opposing U. S. legal system. Although there have been limited studies on tribal law enforcement, those studies have primarily focused on quantitative data related to crime statistics in Indian Country. This research study gives tribal law enforcement education and training practitioners, and advocacy group’s direction in creating tribal leadership trainings that address gaps that exist in Native American police training programs. The following two questions were used to guide the research: (1) How are U. S. legal system challenges affecting tribal culture, traditions, and sovereignty, and how do tribal <b>police</b> <b>chiefs</b> address them? (2) How do tribal <b>police</b> <b>chiefs</b> maintain and/or support tribal traditions and culture within the tribal police department despite working within contradictory, opposing, or restrictive U. S. laws and regulations? This research design followed a multi-case study methodology focusing on seven Native American <b>police</b> <b>chiefs</b> who work in departments located in Indian Country across the United States. A multi-case study approach provided an opportunity to compare and contrast the challenges that exist for tribal <b>police</b> <b>chiefs</b> who must work under the mandated U. S. legal system. This research study used five primary data collection methods: (a) in-depth, open-ended interviews; (b) journaling; (c) peer review; (d) member checking; and (e) the review of related documents and archival records. The collection of data resulted in the emergence of following four dominant themes: 1. The U. S. legal system has had a significant influence on the operations of today's tribal police departments and their adherence to tribal culture, tradition, and sovereignty. 2. Tribal <b>police</b> <b>chiefs</b> and their departments have unequal police power and authority in Indian Country. 3. Jurisdictional restrictions created by the U. S. legal system have created complex, confusing, and challenging conflicts for tribal <b>police</b> <b>chiefs.</b> 4. The U. S. legal system has created an environment of bias and restrictive policing practices for tribal <b>police</b> <b>chiefs</b> and their departments. This study revealed that Native American <b>police</b> <b>chiefs</b> are highly dedicated professionals working under an unequal set of legal constraints and restrictive police powers. To allow them to fully administer the leadership duties and responsibilities expected of them by their tribes and peers, tribal <b>police</b> <b>chiefs</b> need access to training and support systems that will assist them in understanding how to navigate through complex challenges surrounding legal issues and tribal policing power and legal authority. This research provides clarity for educators, trainers, and tribal law enforcement advocates who are seeking to understand and develop tribal leadership training programs for tribal <b>police</b> <b>chiefs.</b> This research provides insights into the multitude of existing legal system problems that currently are not being addressed through tribal leadership training and education. Hopefully this research will add to the body of knowledge on tribal police leadership and encourage academic and training professionals to actively pursue training initiatives that will support tribal <b>police</b> <b>chiefs</b> as they continue to lead within their tribal police departments...|$|R
