50|$|Drying is an {{important}} step in the formulation and development of a pharmaceutical product. It is important to keep the residual moisture low enough to prevent product deterioration and ensure free flowing properties. The commonly used dryers include Fluidized - bed dryer, Vacuum tray dryer, Microwave dryer, Spray dryer, Freeze dryer, Turbo - tray dryer, <b>Pan</b> <b>dryer,</b> etc.|$|E
40|$|Clay pans (playas) {{are common}} landforms of {{semi-arid}} and arid desert regions {{ranging in size}} from 1 to 2 km 2 to greater than 10, 000 km 2. The first observations of surface energy exchanges over a clay pan in central Australia using the eddy covariance method are presented. Measurements were obtained in the late dry season (September) before the onset of the Australian summer monsoon under clear skies and weak synoptic winds for five consecutive days. Sensible heat flux displayed an upward trend over the observation period reaching a peak of approximately 50 % of net radiation over the period, while latent heat flux declined as the clay <b>pan</b> became <b>dryer.</b> Ground heat flux was similar in magnitude to sensible heat flux reaching maximum values near noon, approximately 2 h before daily maximum sensible heat flux. Net radiation and ground heat flux both reached minimum values 1 â€“ 2 h after sunset and then gradually increased towards sunrise, while sensible and latent heat flux remained close to zero. Bowen Ratio values increased from 4. 08 to 6. 12 over the study period as the surface dried. Results highlight clay pans as significant sources of sensible heat in desert landscapes...|$|R
