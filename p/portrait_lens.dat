2500|$|Throughout most of {{his life}} White was limited financially in what camera and lenses he used. He once {{declared}} [...] "The most important factor in the selection [...] being a $50.00 limit."

2500|$|Wentzel {{was often}} {{asked how he}} managed to put his {{subjects}} at such ease while photographing them. [...] He observed that he read as many ethnographic studies of a region as possible, to avoid making culturally insensitive errors. He also tried {{to pick up a}} few words of the local language, and be as courteous as possible. He said that he often made friends with the people he was photographing. [...] "After we got to be friends, I would just back up and take the picture. That was a good part of my technique," [...] he said. He also brought a small musical box along with him, which helped to ease suspicion and win friends (especially among children). His choice of equipment also influenced his style. Wentzel told an interviewer in 1999 that, while in Africa, he used only lightweight 35 mm film cameras such as a Nikon or an Olympus OM-2. For more formal portraits, however, he used an 85mm <b>portrait</b> <b>lens</b> and Kodachrome film. When printing his photographs, he preferred the Ilfochrome process (which turned photographic slides into prints) and the gelatin silver print process.|$|E

50|$|<b>Portrait</b> <b>lenses</b> {{are often}} {{relatively}} inexpensive, {{because they can}} be built simply, and are close to the normal range. The cheapest <b>portrait</b> <b>lenses</b> are normal lenses (50mm), used on a cropped sensor. For example, the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II is the least expensive Canon lens, but when used on a 1.6× cropped sensor yields an 80mm equivalent focal length, which is at the wide end of <b>portrait</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|From the {{invention}} of photography in the 19th century, images have been captured using standard optical telescopes including telescope objectives adapted as early <b>portrait</b> <b>lenses.</b> Besides being used in an astronomical role in astrophotography, telescopes are adapted as long-focus lenses in nature photography, surveillance, machine vision and long-focus microscopy.|$|R

50|$|It is a macro lens, {{meaning that}} {{it is capable of}} {{reproducing}} an object the size of the image sensor, known as 1:1 magnification. Despite the macro designation, the lens can focus to infinity like regular lenses. As such, it is appropriate for use as a <b>portrait</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Tamron SP 45mm F1.8 Di VC USD is an {{interchangeable}} standard {{prime lens}} for cameras {{with a full}} frame or smaller sensor.

5000|$|The <b>portrait</b> {{objective}} <b>lens</b> {{consisted of}} a cemented double lens in front (...) and a double lens with {{a gap in the}} back. The rear double lens was necessary for the correction of spherical and coma errors. The Chevalier lens used two cemented double lenses, but was immediately replaced by the Petzval lens, so that the Petzval Porträtlinse was the first cemented lens in widespread use. The first <b>portrait</b> objective <b>lenses</b> were rather small and had a diameter of 2.6 cm. The 1856 Petzval lenses produced by Dietzler had a diameter of 15 cm and a weight of 15 kg, with which one could make portraits measuring 33 by 42 cm. http://www.telescope-optics.net/curvature.htm ...|$|R

5000|$|The Protar is {{considered}} the first [...] "modern" [...] lens, because it had an asymmetric formula allowed by the new design freedom opened up by newly available barium oxide, crown optical glasses. These glasses were invented by Ernst Abbe, a physicist, and Otto Schott, a chemist, (both Germany) in 1884, working for Carl Zeiss' Jena Glass Works. Schott glasses have higher refractive index than soda-lime crown glass without higher dispersion. The Protar's front achromat used older glass, but the rear achromat used high index glass. Virtually all good quality photographic lenses since circa 1930 are anastigmat corrected. (The primary exceptions are deliberately [...] "soft-focus" [...] <b>portrait</b> <b>lenses.)</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Fujinon XF 56mm f/1.2 R: This is a {{standard}} <b>portrait</b> length <b>lens,</b> with a field of view similar to an 85 mm lens on a full frame camera with an 1.2 aperture. Officially announced on January 6, 2014.|$|R
5000|$|In 1878, Roberts had a 7-inch {{refractor}} at {{his home}} in Rock Ferry, Birkenhead. Although at the time he used this for visual observation, he began to explore stellar photography, his forte, a few years later. In 1883, Roberts began experimenting with astrophotography. He first used <b>portrait</b> <b>lenses</b> with apertures varying from [...] to 8 inches. Roberts was pleased with the results, and ordered a reflecting telescope with a silver-on-glass mirror of 20-inch diameter (100-inch focal length) from Howard Grubb and by 1885 he had built an observatory building to house it. He mounted photographic plates directly at the prime focus to avoid the loss of light that would occur from using a second mirror. This allowed him to make significant progress in the then-developing field of astrophotography.|$|R
5000|$|The Hektor is a {{photographic}} lens design manufactured by Leica Camera. The first [...] "fast" [...] lens {{available for the}} Leica I(A) was the Hektor 50mm f/2,5. Later, the design was adapted {{for use as a}} long <b>portrait</b> <b>lens,</b> available first in a 135mm f/4,5 screw-mount version and later in a 125mm f/2,5 bayonet-mount version. It is reported that Max Berek, who designed the original lens line for Leitz, named the [...] "Hektor" [...] after his dog.|$|E
50|$|He came up {{with the}} Petzval Portrait (modern Austria) in 1840, a four-element lens {{consisting}} of a front-cemented achromat and a rear air-spaced achromat that, at f/3.6, was the first wide-aperture <b>portrait</b> <b>lens.</b> It was appropriate for one- to two-minute shaded outdoors daguerreotype exposures. With the faster collodion (wet plate) process developed in the 1850s, a camera equipped with this lens could take one- to two-minute indoor portraits. Because of national chauvinism, the Petzval did not win the prize, despite being far superior to all other entries.|$|E
50|$|Omega is {{the name}} of various medium-format cameras and enlargers. The Simmon Brothers, known for their line of enlargers, built the {{original}} Simmon Omega cameras in the United States. These rangefinder cameras took 6x7cm photographs on 120 roll film. Later, Konica manufactured the Koni Omega line. The last models, including the Rapid Omega 200, came from Mamiya. This line had interchangeable lenses, including a 58 (or 60) mm wide-angle, a 90 mm normal lens, a 135 mm <b>portrait</b> <b>lens,</b> and a 180 mm telephoto. A close-up adapter was popular with wedding photographers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1980 a {{planetoid}} (3716 Petzval, 1980 TG) {{was named}} after Petzval upon {{the request of the}} astronomical institute in Tatranská Lomnica and Czech scientists; Petzval's <b>portrait</b> objective <b>lens</b> made possible the discovery of many planetoids {{at the end of the}} 19th century. The Austrian Board of Education has bestowed the [...] "Petzval Medal" [...] for special achievements in the area of scientific photography since 1928.|$|R
50|$|The Petzval {{objective}} or Petzval lens, is {{the first}} photographic <b>portrait</b> objective <b>lens</b> (160mm focal length) {{in the history of}} photography; It was developed by the German-Hungarian mathematics professor Josef Maximilian Petzval in 1840 in Vienna, with technical advice provided by , the Voigtländer company went on to build the first Petzval lens in 1840 on behalf of Petzval, and whereupon it became known throughout Europe. Later, the optical instruments maker Carl Dietzler in Vienna also produced the Petzval lens.|$|R
5000|$|When {{photographs}} are viewed at the ordinary viewing distance, {{the angle of}} view at which the image is captured accounts completely for the appearance of perspective distortion. The general assumption that [...] "undoctored" [...] photos cannot distort a scene is incorrect. Perspective distortion is particularly noticeable in portraits taken with wide-angle lenses at short camera-to-subject distances. They generally give an unpleasant impression, making the nose appear too large {{with respect to the}} rest of the face, and distorting the facial expression. Framing the same subject identically while using a moderate telephoto or long focus lens (with a narrow angle of view) flattens the image to a more flattering perspective. It is for this reason that, for a 35 mm camera, lenses with focal lengths from about 85 through 135 mm are generally considered to be good <b>portrait</b> <b>lenses.</b> It does however make difference, whether the photograph is taken landscape or portrait. A 50 mm lens is suitable for photographing people when the orientation is landscape. Conversely, using lenses with much longer focal lengths for portraits results in more extreme flattening of facial features, which also may be objectionable to the viewer.|$|R
5000|$|In 1840, he {{designed}} his famous <b>portrait</b> <b>lens.</b> 1845 brought disputes with the entrepreneur Peter Wilhelm Friedrich von Voigtländer (1812 - 1878) over {{who had the}} right to produce Petzval's lenses. In 1859, Petzval's home was broken into, and his manuscripts [...] - [...] a result of many years of research [...] - [...] were destroyed. Petzval never managed to reconstruct the lost documents. His most refined technical book on optics, lost with his manuscripts, would never appear in print. From then on, he primarily concerned himself with acoustics and began to withdraw from society. His enterprise with Carl Dietzler failed in 1862 (see further below); Dietzler died in 1872.|$|E
5000|$|Donati's Comet was {{successfully}} photographed on September 27 by W. Usherwood, a portrait photographer at Walton-on-the-Hill, Surrey, using a 7-second exposure with an 2.4 <b>portrait</b> <b>lens,</b> {{the first time}} a comet had been photographed. Usherwood's photograph, which has not survived, showed the bright region around the comet's nucleus and a part of the tail. G.P. Bond also successfully photographed the comet on September 28 at Harvard College Observatory, the first comet photograph through a telescope. He made several attempts with increasing exposure times, finally achieving a discernible image. He later wrote, [...] "only the nucleus and a little nebulosity 15" [...] in diameter acted on the plate in an exposure of six minutes".|$|E
50|$|A 150mm Petzval lens {{was fitted}} to a conical metal Voigtländer camera taking {{circular}} daguerreotypes in 1841. The Voigtländer-Petzval {{was the first}} camera and lens specifically designed to take photographs, instead of being simply a modified artist's camera obscura. The Petzval Portrait was the dominant <b>portrait</b> <b>lens</b> for nearly a century. It had what would now be considered severe field curvature and astigmatism, but It was centrally sharp (about a 20° field of view, or 10° for critical applications), and it quickly drifted out of focus to a soft outer field, producing a pleasant halo effect around the subject. The Petzval Portrait remains popular as a projection lens where the narrow angles involved mean the field curvature is not significant.|$|E
5000|$|Petzval's <b>portrait</b> {{objective}} <b>lens</b> (Petzval Porträtobjektiv) was {{an almost}} distortionless Anachromatischer vierlinser (double achromatic objective lens, with four lenses in three groups). The luminous intensity of this flat [...] "portrait lens" [...] was substantially higher than the daguerre standard of 1839, the Wollaston Chevalier lens (...) [...] The screen [...] with a focal length of 160 mm made crucially shorter exposure times possible — using exposures of only about 15 to 30 seconds compared to the 10 minutes previously. Thus, snapshots became possible for the first time.|$|R
50|$|Canon makes several lenses for the EF {{lens mount}} and EF-S lens mount that are well-suited for <b>portrait</b> {{photography}}. These <b>lenses</b> {{may also be}} used for other purposes, often being suited for indoor sports photography as well, due to suitable focal length and wide aperture, though autofocus speed is an issue in sports photography that is less important in portraiture.|$|R
