5|$|In December 2010, Karelian Trains, a {{joint venture}} by VR and RZhD, started a new service linking Helsinki to St. Petersburg, Russia using {{a new model of}} the Pendolino called the Sm6 Allegro. The Sm6 is {{technically}} based on the Pendolino Nuovo, but its looks are similar to the Sm3. The most significant difference is that an Sm6 unit is composed of seven carriages. The train is capable of dual-voltage running due to differences between the electric systems of the Finnish and Russian rail network and is equipped with four <b>pantographs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oslo Sporveier {{opted for}} the all-new MX3000 from Siemens as a {{replacement}} for the T1000 stock instead of the T2000. Although its design was found to be unsuitable, the T2000 was initially not planned to be replaced by the MX3000, as the line was to remain with overhead wires and none of the new MX3000 trains are equipped with <b>pantographs.</b> However, following Oslo's decision to host the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, it was decided to upgrade the Holmenkollen Line to full metro standard, allowing longer than two-car trains. A proposal to downgrade the line to light rail standard and make it part of the Oslo Tramway was rejected.|$|E
5|$|However, by the mid-1980s, {{reliability}} {{had become}} such a problem (even on the slower Harrisburg corridor) that trains of Metroliners were often towed by locomotives. On January 25, 1988, Amtrak began towing all Metroliner cars on the Keystone Service with AEM-7 locomotives rather than running them under their own power, although the cars had their <b>pantographs</b> up to power lighting and heating systems. A wreck of the Washington-Boston Night Owl four days later in Chester, Pennsylvania took two AEM-7 locomotives out of commission, exacerbating a shortage of electric motive power available to Amtrak. On February 1, Amtrak converted all Keystone Service trains to diesel power and terminated them on the lower level of 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, as diesel-powered trains were not allowed in the tunnels to Suburban Station. The Metroliners continued {{to be used as}} coaches for several years before being replaced by Amfleet cars.|$|E
30|$|The {{contact force}} between the <b>pantograph</b> head and {{catenary}} {{is provided by}} the <b>pantograph</b> head spring system, so the weight of <b>pantograph</b> head will affect the following <b>pantograph</b> head.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{researched}} on the {{influence of}} <b>pantograph</b> head parameters {{on the power}} collection quality under the condition of motion in a curved track with a radius of 100  m. The <b>pantograph</b> head parameters are the weight of <b>pantograph</b> head parts, the stiffness of <b>pantograph</b> head elastic element and the damping of <b>pantograph</b> head elastic element.|$|R
40|$|Shinkansen noise can be {{classified}} into four categories; <b>pantograph</b> noise, aerodynamic noise from the train nose, aerodynamic noise from the upper parts of cars, and noise from the lower parts of cars and structure-borne noise as shown Fig. 1. <b>Pantograph</b> noise is one of main sources of noise. <b>Pantograph</b> noise is composed of aerodynamic noise from the <b>pantograph</b> itself, spark noise caused by contact loss, and sliding noise generated between the contact strips and the overhead contact line. If there is a decreased amount of contact loss, most of the <b>pantograph</b> noise is due to aerodynamic noise from the <b>pantograph</b> itself (including insulators). Therefore, the noise sources of the PS 207 type <b>pantograph</b> (Fig. 2) were investigated in detail, and two types of low-noise <b>pantograph</b> were developed; a<-shaped arm type <b>pantograph,</b> which is an improve...|$|R
5|$|In 1960, two less {{powerful}} T single-car units were built, {{designed to be}} prototypes used on the Oslo Tramway. After a one-year trial, they were put into scheduled traffic to the Kolsås Line, where they remained in regular service until 1983. The production series is somewhat different in design and performance. T1000 is both {{used to refer to}} the class as a whole, or the first 162 cars, that are only equipped with third-rail shoes. They have four slight variations, which have been given the designations T1–T4. The T1300 is a series of 33 new and sixteen rebuilt T4 trains equipped with <b>pantographs</b> which previously allowed them operate on {{the western part of the}} network, prior to it being upgraded to third-rail metro standards. The newer units were designated T5 and T6, while the rebuilt units were designated T7 and T8.|$|E
5|$|On February 1, 1968, the PRR {{merged with}} New York Central Railroad to become Penn Central. The {{remainder}} of the cars were delivered with Penn Central logos, but retained the PRR-specified livery of gray paint with red pinstripes. On March 2, the first GE-powered Metroliners arrived for testing. The <b>pantographs</b> on the Westinghouse-powered cars would bounce on the aging catenary wires, then draw high currents due to improperly designed transformers. The GE-powered cars proved to have a superior pantograph design, but were still not fit for service. On March 12, entry into revenue service was delayed indefinitely. Testing was suspended entirely between June 24 and mid-July; tests with 6-car trains in July had severe issues with electrical arcing. The first combined test train of GE and Westinghouse cars ran on August 8.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} new rolling stock on the western {{suburban}} tramways prompted Oslo Sporveier to order a modified version to the T1000. This was because they had plans to connect the eastern and western networks, and gradually convert the western lines to metro standard. The T1300 units were built with the same specifications as the T1000, but were also equipped with <b>pantographs</b> so they could operate on the light rail lines. They also had a slightly different front. The initial order was for 33 units, which were designated T5 and T6. The former 18 units had a cab in one end, while the latter 15 had a cab in both ends, allowing Oslo Sporveier to operate single-car trains. The new units were put into service on the Røa and Sognsvann Lines, and were also used on the Kolsås Line outside rush-hour.|$|E
50|$|When {{there was}} no {{compressed}} air in the unit's system to raise a <b>pantograph</b> to start up, a <b>pantograph</b> hook stick was used to manually raise the <b>pantograph.</b> This started the high voltage motor which drove the auxiliary alternator to supply 110V power to start the compressor and power other control circuits. Once there was enough main air pressure to keep the <b>pantograph</b> in the raised position, the <b>pantograph</b> hook stick could be removed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pantograph</b> used on 325 was {{the stock}} Faiveley GPU. The wiper {{assembly}} on this <b>pantograph</b> weighs under 8 kg (18 lb) and {{is mounted on}} a vertical shock absorber with 150 mm (6 in) travel. The main structure of the <b>pantograph</b> is constructed of cylindrical tubing, which (Faiveley claims) reduces the <b>pantograph's</b> sensitivity to random variations in environmental factors. The only modifications to the GPU <b>pantograph</b> were {{an increase in the}} stiffness of the pneumatic dampers, and a reduced total aerodynamic lift of the structure.|$|R

5|$|The first Norwegian-built tram was {{delivered}} on 16 February 1983 {{and put into}} service on 9 March. The last unit was put into service on 10 January 1984. The Strømmen trams were numbered 111 through 125. There were few problems in the start, although the <b>pantographs</b> had technical problems and there were occasional power failures in the overhead wires due to out-of-date rectifiers {{not being able to}} handle the increase power usage. Trams no. 101 through 113 were put into service on Line 9 on the Lilleaker Line and the Ekeberg Line, replacing the Class E. The remaining trams of the first series were put into service on Line 1, on the Sinsen Line and the Briskeby Line, as well as Line 7, on the Ullevål Hageby Line and the Sinsen Line. On Line 9, that included both the tramway's light rail sections, only SL79-trams were used, while lines 1 and 7 used a mix of SL79 and SM53-trams.|$|E
5|$|The first {{train was}} {{delivered}} on 22 October and {{was put into}} use on the Sørland Line from 1 November. Scheduled travel time was reduced by 40 minutes to 3 hours and 40 minutes. In December, the trains had problems with the <b>pantographs</b> not working correctly in cold weather, causing the trains to lose power and be several hours delayed. NSB stated that a contributing cause was the previous year's mild winter, which {{made it impossible to}} test the trains in extreme weather. After {{two and a half months}} of operation on the Sørland Line, every other train was at least 5 minutes late and every tenth train at least 20 minutes late. The trains also caused travel sickness, also among employees, particularly on the section from Kristiansand to Bø. NSB stated that this had also occurred on the old trains and that it was reports of the number of people affected were exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} aging Class C trains, from 1985 to 1987, ten T4s were {{converted}} to T1300. They were equipped with a pantograph, received a new front and the doors were moved. Six additional T4s were converted in 1989, and given the designation T8. These only had the <b>pantographs</b> equipped and kept the same front and door arrangement. With {{the introduction of the}} T1300, the western lines could remove the conductor and have single-manned trains with the motorman selling tickets. The T1300-units have had better regularity than the older models they replaced. However, because they are designed for a closed system with automatic train protection, the braking systems are not sufficiently dimensioned for when the drivers use line of sight to regulate the speed and distances between trains. The 1300 units were numbered 1301–1349. After the conversions, Oslo Sporveier operated 49 T1300-cars and 146 T1000-cars. The trains were originally painted red with a beige cheatline.|$|E
50|$|The DeHa 2000 {{cars were}} {{originally}} fitted with one lozenge type <b>pantograph.</b> The <b>pantograph</b> on DeHa 2001 was damaged on 20 October 2013, entailing its replacement with a spare single-arm <b>pantograph</b> from 22 October - {{a first for}} trains on the line.|$|R
50|$|The locomotive's <b>pantograph</b> {{placement}} {{is unusual}} in not being equidistant from the locomotive ends.

25|$|Trams {{or light}} rail cars {{equipped}} with <b>pantographs</b> normally cannot operate on lines with overhead wiring designed for trolley-pole collection. For this reason, these systems {{and a few}} others worldwide retain use of trolley poles, even on new streetcars (except in Riga), {{in order to avoid the}} difficulty and expense of modifying long stretches of existing overhead wires to accept <b>pantographs.</b> However, the Toronto Transit Commission is converting streetcar overhead to be compatible with both trolley poles and <b>pantographs.</b> (The older CLRV and ALRV streetcars use only trolley poles while the newer Flexity Outlook are equipped for both trolley poles and <b>pantographs.)</b> Along Queens Quay West, since September 12, 2017, streetcars for route 510 Spadina use trolley poles while those for 509 Harbourfront use <b>pantographs</b> along the same section of track.|$|E
25|$|L class {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} two <b>pantographs.</b> The VR issued instructions for both <b>pantographs</b> {{to be raised}} in winter months, with the first pantograph serving to knock ice off the overhead catenary and ensure good contact for the second pantograph.|$|E
25|$|Cars 3, 6, and 9 are {{fitted with}} PS21 lozenge type <b>pantographs.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As {{the contact}} wire makes {{contact with the}} <b>pantograph,</b> the carbon insert {{on top of the}} <b>pantograph</b> is worn down. The [...] "straight" [...] wire between {{supports}} will cause the contact wire to cross over the whole surface of the <b>pantograph</b> as the train travels around the curve, causing uniform wear and avoiding any notches. On straight track, the contact wire is zigzagged slightly to the left and right of centre at each successive support so that the <b>pantograph</b> wears evenly. The movement of the contact wire across the head of the <b>pantograph</b> is called the 'sweep'.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{researched}} on the {{influence of}} <b>pantograph</b> head parameters {{on the power}} collection quality. Reducing the weight of the pantograph head, increasing the stiffness of <b>pantograph</b> head elastic element or increasing the damping of <b>pantograph</b> head elastic element can improve the power collection quality to a certain extent.|$|R

25|$|At its {{inception}} Line 12 operated four-motor Sprague-Thomson trains, equipped with 600 volt <b>pantographs</b> and scrubbers, the overhead system which supplies the trains with electricity. After {{the integration of}} the line into the CMP network, the overhead lines and <b>pantographs</b> were removed. The trains remained unique, using a grey and blue colour scheme for the 2nd class cars and red and yellow for 1st class until 1972.|$|E

50|$|As on the Class 7E, the locomotive's <b>pantograph</b> {{contact shoe}} centres are {{directly}} above the bogie pivot centres {{to reduce the}} possibility of <b>pantograph</b> hookups on catenary in sharp curves, such as in turnouts, {{as a result of}} sideways movement of the <b>pantograph</b> in relation to the overhead wire.|$|R
