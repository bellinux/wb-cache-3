40|$|AbstractChlorophyll {{synthesis}} {{and degradation}} were analyzed in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by incubating {{cells in the}} presence of 13 C-labeled glucose or 15 N-containing salts. Upon mass spectral analysis of chlorophyll isolated from cells grown {{in the presence of}} 13 C-glucose for different time periods, four chlorophyll pools were detected that differed markedly in the amount of 13 C incorporated into the porphyrin (Por) and phytol (<b>Phy)</b> moieties of the molecule. These four pools represent (i) unlabeled chlorophyll (12 Por 12 <b>Phy),</b> (ii) 13 C-labeled chlorophyll (13 Por 13 <b>Phy),</b> and (iii, iv) chlorophyll, in which either the porphyrin or the phytol moiety was 13 C-labeled, whereas the other constituent of the molecule remained unlabeled (13 Por 12 <b>Phy</b> and 12 Por 13 <b>Phy).</b> The kinetics of 12 Por 12 <b>Phy</b> disappearance, presumably due to chlorophyll de-esterification, and of 13 Por 12 <b>Phy,</b> 12 Por 13 <b>Phy,</b> and 13 Por 13 <b>Phy</b> accumulation due to chlorophyll synthesis provided evidence for continuous chlorophyll turnover in Synechocystis cells. The loss of 12 Por 12 <b>Phy</b> was three-fold faster in a photosystem I-less strain than in a photosystem II-less strain and was accelerated in wild-type cells upon exposure to strong light. These data suggest that most chlorophyll appears to be de-esterified in Synechocystis upon dissociation and repair of damaged photosystem II. A substantial part of chlorophyllide and phytol released upon the de-esterification of chlorophyll can be recycled for the biosynthesis of new chlorophyll molecules contributing to the formation of 13 Por 12 <b>Phy</b> and 12 Por 13 <b>Phy</b> chlorophyll pools. The phytol kinase, Slr 1652, plays a significant but not absolutely critical role in this recycling process...|$|R

Materials and methodsUsing various mouse tumor xenograft and allograft models, <b>PHY</b> 906 has been shown to enhance the chemotherapeutic efficacy of a variety of anticancer agents in various cancers. The <b>PHY</b> 906 clinical program consists of five trials in three different types of cancers in both the United States and Taiwan.

To study the prevalence and incidence rates of mood, anxiety and substance use disorders in groups with <b>PHY,</b> MUS and combined MUS and <b>PHY</b> compared to a no-symptoms reference group in the general population. Data were derived from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study- 2 (NEMESIS- 2), a nationally representative face-to-face survey of the general population aged 18 - 64 years.

The assessment of common mental disorders was through the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3. 0.

A problematic issue arises when the rate adaptation algorithm aggressively and rapidly reduces the <b>PHY</b> rate due to short-term degradation of channel quality.

Results: Both <b>PHY</b> 906 and antibiotic treatment changed the profile of intestinal bacteria species: Lactobacillus/ Enterococcus, Bacteroides, Clostridium leptum, and E. rectale/C. coccoides. Antibiotic treatment did not alter the ability of <b>PHY</b> 906 to enhance the antitumor activity of CPT- 11.

However, <b>PHY</b> 906 treatment was able to protect against the body weight loss in the CPT- 11 /antibiotic treatment group.
