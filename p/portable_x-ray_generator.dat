40|$|Ideal {{operating}} theatre in 21 st {{century is}} proposed and discussed. The basic concept, equipment and devices {{are presented in}} this lecture. We are now investigating the fully computer aided surgical system {{under the name of}} the project called Hiviscas (high definition television-computer aided surgery) system. This system is composed of several devices and tools, (1) Three dimentional high definition television without any special glasses. (2) Volumegraph which facilitates a transparent visualization of neurological disorders such as tumor or hematoma in the head of the patient. The 3 dimensional CT scan or MR image is examined by setting the standard positions, and the standard positions are adjusted to the patient 2 ̆ 7 s head in the operating theatre. The images are visualized through the Volumegraph plate. (3) Three dimensional ultrasound diagnostic device. (4) Computerized preoperative and intraoperative image monitoring system. (5) Open MRI and movable CT scanner. (6) Intraoperative radiosurgical device called Photon Radiosurgical System (PRS). PRS is a <b>portable</b> soft <b>X-ray</b> <b>generator</b> which is operated by 12 V electrical currency. The probe of PRS is inserted into the tumor and irradiate the tumor during the surgery or by stereotactic surgical technique. The local control of the tumor by PRS treatment has been proved for malignant brain tumors. These combined systems will be installed in our Medical University Hospital before the year 2, 000 and is expected to become a model operating theatre in 21 st century...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the most {{relevant}} developments in the realisation of <b>portable</b> Energy-Dispersive <b>X-ray</b> Fluorescence (EDXRF) equipments are discussed. In particular, the latest advances in non-cryogenic (Peltier cooled) X-ray detectors and miniaturised <b>X-ray</b> <b>generators</b> are shown. The energy resolution of the new detection systems is adequate to resolve the characteristic X-ray emission lines of contiguous elements. This small size and low power make the system ideal for portable instrumentation and have stimulated the development of small- and low-power <b>X-ray</b> <b>generators</b> {{which can be used}} for the excitation of fluorescence radiation in a broad energy range (5 - 40 keV). Finally, the use of EDXRF related to archaeometric research (pigments in ancient paintings and major elements in the metal alloys) is emphasised.

30|$|<b>X-ray</b> <b>generators</b> {{are often}} bulky devices, {{as a result}} of the thermal disspiation and {{subsequent}} cooling requirements. Certain user specifications necessitate significant miniaturisation. Miniaturised sources find use in hand-held non-destructive testing, X-ray spectroscopy, electrically controlled brachytherapy and in situ radiation therapy. Miniature TE sources have been available for many years, but have proven challenging to miniaturise [242]. Amptek has launched a series of miniature X-ray sources [243]. Sealed FE sources, on the other hand, lend themselves to these applications, and in particular are well suited for <b>portable</b> <b>X-ray</b> applications. Though difficult to manufacture, miniaturised sources are emerging on the market place. As in the case of pulsed and multi-pixel sources, much progress has been made towards a miniaturised CNT-based FE X-ray source though, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no such devices have, as yet, made it to market.|$|R
