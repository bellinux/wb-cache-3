40|$|In this article, a <b>procedural</b> <b>overview</b> {{of basic}} {{abdominal}} sonography {{in the average}} patient is provided. Patient preparation (i. e., fasting) for specific examinations is discussed. Transducer selection {{on the basis of}} the body habitus of the patient, as well as the examination to be performed, is reviewed. Use of patient history and communication in decisions regarding the anatomy to be evaluated is discussed. A detailed technical review of scanning techniques to image the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and kidneys is also provided...|$|E
40|$|Objective and Rationale: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a comprehensive, yet brief, flowchart type of overview of the salient literature describing the key chronological steps involved in developing “pencil and paper,” self-report, health-related survey instruments – particularly survey instruments which endeavor to measure abstract construct such as “quality of life,” “disability,” or “productivity. ” This overview was designed to serve as a convenient reference guide for individuals who need to understand the basics of the whole process. Because it does not describe any of the steps in detail, the flowchart will likely be most useful to individuals who have at least some prior familiarity with the concepts, procedures and analyses mentioned, yet are not fully “expert ” in this topic area. In short, this overview is not actually meant to be a “checklist ” of key steps; brief explanations are included in order to remind the – at least somewhat – initiated user of the concepts mentioned, without the reader necessarily having to look them up elsewhere. Design: This is a distillation of the salient surveydevelopment literature into a <b>procedural</b> <b>overview</b> flowchart. Method: This overview was a distillation of several authoritative sources in the literature covering the key areas of questionnaire development and psychometric theory. The overview flowchart was constructed in the form of 5 chronological, developmental phases, which formed the overall framework...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} briefly examine {{the process of}} {{creating}} a new South African Constitution in the 1990 s. Nearly a decade of talks preceded the adoption of South Africa 2 ̆ 7 s first multi-racial democratic constitution in 1994. These talks and the subsequent drafting conventions created an astonishing document, stunning in its novelty in South African history, in its expressed values, and in its fundamental compromises. Part Three draws {{on a wide variety of}} primary documents from disparate sources to offer an original historical reconstruction of the inclusion of sexual orientation protections in the policy documents, Bill of Rights drafts, and constitutional proposals of the various South African political parties, as well as in the early drafts of the constitutional text. In addition to reviewing the rights protections in legal documents preceding the 1996 Constitution and public opinion expressed in the Constitutional Assembly 2 ̆ 7 s Public Participation Programme, this section examines the increasingly visible, newly political, and haltingly multi-racial group of activists attempting to redefine gay rights in the context of liberation. This historical account examines these developments over three time periods: the era of constitutional theorizing preceding the lifting of the ban on the ANC and other liberation movements in 1990, the drafting period for the 1993 Interim Constitution, and the time period for review and final negotiations regarding the 1996 Constitution. Part Four uses this freshly reconstructed history and the earlier <b>procedural</b> <b>overview</b> to argue that the unique characteristics of the political and social history of South Africa set the stage for novel protections, that treatment of sexual orientation-based equality as an unexamined corollary to the dominant ANC ideology of non-racialism provided the justification, and that an autocratic constitutional drafting process secured the final pro-gay content of the discrimination protections...|$|E

It also contains introduction to OpenGL, overview of techniques used for generating <b>procedural</b> textures and <b>overview</b> of rendering methods based on Ray Casting...|$|R
40|$|Virtual reality based {{simulation}} is {{an appealing}} option to supplement traditional clini-cal education. However, the formal integration of training simulators into the medi-cal curriculum is still lacking. Especially, {{the lack of}} a reasonable level of realism sup-posedly hinders the widespread use of this technology. Therefore, we try to tackle this situation with a reference surgical simulator of the highest possible fidelity for <b>procedural</b> training. This <b>overview</b> describes all elements that have been combined into our training system as well as first results of simulator validation. Our frame-work allows the rehearsal of several aspects of hysteroscopy—for instance, correct fluid management, handling of excessive bleeding, appropriate removal of intra-uterine tumors, or the use of the surgical instrument. ...|$|R
