On Halloween her father, to amuse her, picks a pumpkin that she selects, and fashions a jack-o-lantern out of it. Her new toy pleases the child immensely, and at once takes a place in her affections equal to that held by her dollie. So it is natural {{that she should be}} thinking about the two of them when she is tucked into bed and falls asleep. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> why the queen of the fairies came to her and invited her to a Halloween party that her loyal subjects were giving in their woodland retreat. And so that Marie would be perfectly happy, not feel embarrassed among strangers, the queen asked Dollie and Pumpkin to be her guests also. And, as a further mark of favor, she waved her hand, and Dollie and Pumpkin could run around and talk as well as Marie could. It certainly made it more enjoyable for the little girl. A fairy Halloween party is one of the finest things going in the amusement line, and only very nice and very good little girls are invited to them. As Marie filled these requirements, she had a perfectly glorious time, but was inclined to weep when she woke up later in her own little bed, and found that her toys had lost their miraculous gift of life. But it consoled her somewhat to have them, for they served as reminders of her wonderful evening. And perhaps the fairies will ask her to attend another party later. If they do, she has decided that Pumpkin and Dollie must have their shares of the good times as before." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shepilov was {{the only}} Central Committee Secretary to oppose Khrushchev in June 1957 when a {{majority}} of the Presidium members tried to oust Khrushchev during the so-called Anti-Party Group affair. He reportedly joined the plot at the last moment when Lazar Kaganovich assured him that the plotters had a majority in the Presidium When Khrushchev prevailed at the Central Committee meeting, he was furious over what he saw as Shepilov's betrayal. Shepilov was ousted from the Central Committee on 29 June 1957 and [...] vilified in the press along with Molotov, Malenkov and Kaganovich, the only 3 other Soviet leaders whose participation in the coup attempt was made public at the time. Shepilov was friend of Marshal Georgy Zhukov and <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the reasons why}} a few months later Zhukov himself was removed from the office.|$|E
2500|$|Vices & Virtues has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album {{has received}} an average score of 62 out of 100, which indicates [...] "generally favourable reviews" [...] based on 15 reviews. Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post called the record [...] "one of 2011's {{best and most}} captivating albums," [...] calling [...] "Sarah Smiles" [...] the [...] "stand-out" [...] and noting the wise change in tone to high-energy with the second track, [...] "Let's Kill Tonight". Alternative Press also welcomed the new version of Panic! at the Disco. [...] "Perhaps Smith and Urie's biggest success on Vices is their disinterest in simply recreating either of their previous albums, instead choosing to meld the youthful exuberance of their debut with the restraint and maturity of 2008's Pretty. Odd.," [...] wrote critic Evan Lucy. [...] "The duo sound absolutely recharged, likely {{a result of the}} lineup shuffling, but also perhaps a realization that the '70s were a nice place to visit for a couple years, but life in the 21st century is much more fun." [...] He went on to praise the [...] "Elfman-esque string arrangements, creepy undertones and twinkling pianos" [...] on several tracks and enjoy the [...] "scaled-back," [...] more personal tracks, such as [...] "The Calendar" [...] and [...] "Memories". James Montgomery of MTV News said of the album, [...] "Vices is at its very core a studio album, one stuffed with ideas and instrumentation, which not only positions Panic! as perhaps this generation's Brian-Wilsons-on-a-budget, but serves as a solid starting point for wherever Urie and Smith choose to go from here." [...] He complimented the new sound of the band: [...] "It's not exactly new, not exactly old, but it's definitely something. Call it a fresh start, a return to form, a re-imaging of the past, just don't call it Pretty. Odd. because that ship has sailed. Panic! are back to their old tricks, exclamation point and all ... and <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the secret ingredient all along." ...|$|E
