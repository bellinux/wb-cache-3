5|$|In {{animals such as}} on the {{feathers}} of birds and the scales of butterflies, interference is created by a range of <b>photonic</b> mechanisms, including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, <b>photonic</b> crystals, crystal fibres, matrices of nanochannels and proteins that can vary their configuration. Some cuts of meat also show structural coloration due to the exposure of the periodic arrangement of the muscular fibres. Many of these <b>photonic</b> mechanisms correspond to elaborate structures visible by electron microscopy. In the few plants that exploit structural coloration, brilliant colours are produced by structures within cells. The most brilliant blue coloration known in any living tissue {{is found in the}} marble berries of Pollia condensata, where a spiral structure of cellulose fibrils produces Bragg's law scattering of light. The bright gloss of buttercups is produced by thin-film reflection by the epidermis supplemented by yellow pigmentation, and strong diffuse scattering by a layer of starch cells immediately beneath.|$|E
5|$|Liquid crystal lasers use {{a liquid}} crystal in the lasing medium as a {{distributed}} feedback mechanism instead of external mirrors. Emission at a <b>photonic</b> bandgap {{created by the}} periodic dielectric structure of the liquid crystal gives a low-threshold high-output device with stable monochromatic emission.|$|E
5|$|<b>Photonic</b> {{crystals}} can {{be formed}} in different ways. In Parides sesostris, the emerald-patched cattleheart butterfly, <b>photonic</b> crystals are formed of arrays of nano-sized {{holes in the}} chitin of the wing scales. The holes have a diameter of about 150 nanometres and {{are about the same}} distance apart. The holes are arranged regularly in small patches; neighbouring patches contain arrays with differing orientations. The result is that these emerald-patched cattleheart scales reflect green light evenly at different angles instead of being iridescent. In Lamprocyphus augustus, a weevil from Brazil, the chitin exoskeleton is covered in iridescent green oval scales. These contain diamond-based crystal lattices oriented in all directions to give a brilliant green coloration that hardly varies with angle. The scales are effectively divided into pixels about a micrometre wide. Each such pixel is a single crystal and reflects light in a direction different from its neighbours.|$|E

5|$|Although blue phases are of {{interest}} for fast light modulators or tunable <b>photonic</b> crystals, they exist in a very narrow temperature range, usually less than a few kelvin. Recently the stabilization of blue phases over a temperature range of more than 60K including room temperature (260–326K) has been demonstrated. Blue phases stabilized at room temperature allow electro-optical switching with response times {{of the order of}} 10−4s.|$|E
5|$|Crystal fibres, formed of {{hexagonal}} {{arrays of}} hollow nanofibres, create the bright iridescent colours of the bristles of Aphrodita, the sea mouse, a non-wormlike genus of marine annelids. The colours are aposematic, warning predators not to attack. The chitin {{walls of the}} hollow bristles form a hexagonal honeycomb-shaped <b>photonic</b> crystal; the hexagonal holes are 0.51 μm apart. The structure behaves optically as if it consisted of a stack of 88 diffraction gratings, making Aphrodita {{one of the most}} iridescent of marine organisms.|$|E
25|$|The {{emerging}} {{field of}} <b>photonic</b> crystals {{led to the}} development in 1991 of photonic-crystal fiber, which guides light by diffraction from a periodic structure, rather than by total internal reflection. The first <b>photonic</b> crystal fibers became commercially available in 2000. <b>Photonic</b> crystal fibers can carry higher power than conventional fibers and their wavelength-dependent properties can be manipulated to improve performance.|$|E

25|$|After a 30-year void, when LH {{materials}} were finally demonstrated, {{it could be}} said that the designation of negative refractive index is unique to LH systems; even when compared to <b>photonic</b> crystals. <b>Photonic</b> crystals, like many other known systems, can exhibit unusual propagation behavior such as reversal of phase and group velocities. But, negative refraction does not occur in these systems, and not yet realistically in <b>photonic</b> crystals.|$|E
25|$|In photonics, band gaps or stop {{bands are}} ranges of photon {{frequencies}} where, if tunneling effects are neglected, no photons {{can be transmitted}} through a material.

The concept of hyperuniformity has broadened the range of <b>photonic</b> band gap materials, beyond <b>photonic</b> crystals.

50|$|During {{the period}} {{leading up to}} the dot-com crash circa 2001, <b>photonics</b> as a field focused largely on optical telecommunications. However, <b>photonics</b> covers a huge range of science and {{technology}} applications, including laser manufacturing, biological and chemical sensing, medical diagnostics and therapy, display technology, and optical computing.

25|$|A common <b>photonic</b> crystal nanocavity design shown is {{essentially}} a <b>photonic</b> crystal with an intentional defect (holes missing). This structure having periodic changes in refractive index {{on the order of}} the length of the optical wavelength satisfies Bragg reflection conditions in the y and z directions for a particular wavelength range, and the slab boundaries in the x direction create another reflective boundary due to oblique reflection at dielectric boundaries. This results in theoretically perfect wave confinement in the y and z directions along the axis of a lattice row, and good confinement along the x direction. Since this confinement effect along the y and z directions (directions of the crystal lattice) is only for a range of frequencies, it has been referred to as a <b>photonic</b> bandgap, since there is a discrete set of photon energies which cannot propagate in the lattice directions in the material. However, because of the diffraction of waves propagating inside this structure, radiation energy does escape the cavity within the <b>photonic</b> crystal slab plane. The lattice spacing can be tuned to produce optimal boundary conditions of the standing wave inside the cavity to produce minimal loss and highest Q.|$|E

Simultaneous spoken digit and speaker recognition and chaotic time-series prediction were demonstrated at data rates beyond 1 gigabyte per second in 2013. Using non-linear photonics to implement an all-optical linear classifier, a perceptron model was capable of learning the classification boundary iteratively from training data through a feedback rule. A core building block in many learning algorithms is to calculate the distance between two vectors: this was first to experimentally demonstrated up to eight dimensions using entangled qubits in a <b>photonic</b> quantum computer in 2015.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of silicon <b>photonics</b> {{is built on}} silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers while the {{majority of}} electronics, including CPUs and memory, are built on bulk silicon wafers, limiting broader acceptance of silicon <b>photonics.</b> This discrepancy is a result of silicon photonics's requirement for a single-crystalline silicon (c-Si) layer and a thick undercladding for optical guiding that bulk silicon wafers to not provide. While the undercladding problem can be partially addressed by substrate removal techniques, the complexity of co-integrating <b>photonics</b> with state-of-the-art transistors and real estate competition between electronics and <b>photonics</b> remain problematic.
