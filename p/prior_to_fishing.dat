Yet, some species might perform unique functional roles while others are redundant. Thus, the benefits of high {{species richness}} in maintaining ecosystem functioning are uncertain if functions have little redundancy, potentially leading to high vulnerability of functions. We studied the natural propensity of assemblages to be functionally buffered against loss <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>fishing</b> activities, using functional trait combinations, in coral reef fish assemblages across unfished wilderness areas of the Indo-Pacific: Chagos Archipelago, New Caledonia and French Polynesia. Fish functional diversity in these wilderness areas is highly vulnerable to fishing, explained by species- and abundance-based redundancy packed into a small combination of traits, leaving most other trait combinations (60 %) sensitive to fishing, with no redundancy. Functional vulnerability peaks for mobile and sedentary top predators, and large species in general. Functional vulnerability decreases for certain functional entities in New Caledonia, where overall functional redundancy was higher. Uncovering these baseline patterns of functional vulnerability can offer early warning signals of the damaging effects from fishing, and may serve as baselines to guide precautionary and even proactive conservation actions...|$|E
40|$|A {{suite of}} {{management}} options for a prawn trawl fishery in Torres Strait, Australia was assessed for {{impacts on the}} benthic fauna using a dynamic management strategy evaluation approach. The specification of the management options was gained through consultation with stakeholders. Data for the model was drawn from several sources: the fleet data from fishery logbooks and satellite vessel monitoring systems, benthic depletion rates from trawl-down experiments, benthic recovery rates from post-experiment recovery monitoring studies, and benthic distribution from large-scale benthic surveys. Although there were large uncertainties in the resulting indicators, robust measures relevant to management were obtained by taking ratios relative to the status quo. The management control with the biggest effect was total effort; reducing trawl effort always led to increases in benthic faunal density of up to 10 %. Spatial closures had a smaller benefit of up to 2 %. The effect of closing a set of buffer zones around reefs to trawling was indistinguishable from the status quo option. Closing a larger area, however, was largely beneficial especially for sea cucumbers. When the spatial distributions of fauna <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>fishing</b> were accounted for, fauna with distributions positively correlated with effort improved relative to those negatively correlated. The reduction in prawn catch under effort reduction scenarios could be ameliorated by introducing temporal closures over the full-moon period. No Full Tex...|$|E

Our estimates of the recommended fishing mortality rate ranged from 0. 10 eM - 0. 10) to 0. 48 (M = 0. 25), resulting in sustainable yields of 40 (M - 0. 10) to 82 t eM = 0. 25) per year. We obtained higher estimates of virgin population density (883 - 1, 710 per km~ when research CPUE data were used. Sustained yield estimates also were higher, ranging from 55 (M - 0. 10) to 148 t (M = 0. 25) per year. Average estimates of recommended yield from commercial and research CPUE data were 58 and 95 t, respectively. Observed yields in the developing fishery exceeded 100 t in 1981 - 84 and in 1986; however, current observations indicate that fishing effort has declined to a low level in response to reduced catches. Based on the assumption that commercial CPUE data better reflect population trends, we recommend that the annual harvest not exceed about 50 t, which should result in a stock biomass of about 400 - 800 t.

40|$|This study {{arose from}} {{recommendations}} given {{in response to}} a legislated ecological assessment of the South Australian Sardine Fishery in 2004, urging it to: (i) attempt to mitigate operational interactions with marine mammals if excessive levels were detected; and (ii) improve the accuracy of their reporting of these events. An initial observer program revealed high rates of encirclement and mortality (1. 78 and 0. 39 dolphins per net-set, respectively) of short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis). This equated to an estimate of 1728 encirclements and 377 mortalities across the entire fleet over the same period. The average time taken for fishers to respond to encirclements was 135. 93 ± 3. 72 min and 21. 3 % of encircled animals subsequently died. During that time, fishers only reported 3. 6 % of encirclements and 1. 9 % of mortalities recorded by observers. A code of practice (CoP) was subsequently introduced aimed at mitigating operational interactions. A second observer program revealed a significant reductions in the observed rates of dolphin encirclement (0. 22; down 87. 3 %) and mortality (0. 01; down 97. 1 %) with an estimate of 169 and eight, respectively. The average time taken for fishers to respond to dolphin encirclements also reduced to 16. 33 ± 4. 67 min (down 76. 9 %) and the proportion of encircled animals that subsequently died reduced to 5. 0 %. Agreement between industry reports and observer records improved, with the fishery reporting 57. 9 % and 58. 9 % of the rate of encirclements and mortalities, respectively, recorded by observers. A number of avoidance and release strategies in the CoP may have been responsible for these improvements. In particular, fishers were required to delay or relocate their activities if dolphins were observed <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>fishing</b> and to release encircled dolphins immediately or abort the fishing event if release procedures were unsuccessful. Future improvements to the CoP include: (i) improved response times when an encircled dolphin is detected; (ii) better use of behavioural cues for deciding when to abort a net-set; (iii) ceasing fishing during rough weather; and (iv) continuing to increase reporting accuracy by fishers. It is also recommended that the abundance, movements and boundaries of the common dolphin population in the region be determined, so that the impact of fishing activities on their status can be established.

40|$|The {{systematic}} {{collection of}} data on fish stocks now used to inform fisheries management began only a few decades ago, however, these data do not provide a true picture of change as commercial fishing began many centuries earlier. Historical information such as that found within old photographs, naturalists’ records, witness testimonies, government data and nautical charts {{can be used to}} reconstruct past environments thus providing a baseline from which to judge the state of the seas today. This study explores both historical and modern data for fish stocks and habitats around the United Kingdom and documents some of the changes that have occurred as a result of fishing, as well as investigating the potential of non-consumptive activities to degrade marine environments. Witness testimonies from the 1860 s and 1880 s reveal that bottom trawling had a devastating and immediate impact upon marine habitats as it expanded around the British Isles. Data sets of demersal fish landings from the 1880 s to the present day reveal that technological improvements have masked fish stock decline and that the UK fishing fleet now has to work 17 times harder to catch the same quantity of fish. Comparisons of historical records with the results of recent survey activities show that bottom trawling has fundamentally altered shellfish habitats and extirpated oyster populations at several sites around the UK. At a global scale, wild fish landings have been in decline since the late 1980 s. However, growth of the global human population means that wild fish availability per capita has in fact been decreasing since 1970, raising concerns regarding meeting nutrition requirements for those countries dependent upon fish protein. A rapid growth in aquaculture is currently compensating for declines in wild fish availability, however this current rate of increase is unlikely to be sustained in the future. Highly protected marine reserves (HPMRs) are spatial tools that aim to protect habitats and marine wildlife within their boundaries from the direct effects of extractive and depositional activities. HPMRs provide a picture of the marine environment in the absence of activities such as fishing, and offer another way of establishing environmental baselines. However, these areas are often used for non-consumptive activities which may also negatively impact upon habitats and wildlife if inadequately managed. An examination of 91 HPMRs from around the world show that many permit potentially damaging non-consumptive activities, such as SCUBA diving or motorised boating, with few regulations in place. Recommendations are made on how to mitigate or manage for these activities so that HPMRs can provide the high levels of ecosystem protection intended whilst still allowing people to use and enjoy these areas. This thesis demonstrates that reliance on recent fisheries data alone is flawed and that knowledge of marine ecosystems <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>fishing</b> is necessary to evaluate the true success of marine management efforts and to set appropriate baselines for recovery.

40|$|Freshwater {{crayfish}} are {{amongst the}} most influential of biota in many aquatic systems. They have various ecological functions, acting as shredders, detritivores and predators which in turn influence other macroinvertebrate fauna. Furthermore, freshwater crayfish are increasingly used as indicator species because of the important role they play in aquatic ecosystems and their iconic and heritage values. Kōura or freshwater crayfish (Paranephrops planifrons White) are endemic to New Zealand where they are {{an important component of}} freshwater ecosystems and a source of food for freshwater fish and humans. This study was undertaken {{to gain a better understanding}} of kōura populations in the Te Arawa lakes by quantifying relative kōura abundance and distribution and assessing the effects of environmental factors on kōura populations. In addition, basic biological information on sex ratios, breeding and moulting was collected as a basis for setting regulations and management policies for the sustainable management of kōura in the Te Arawa lakes. Historically, kōura were an important food for the indigenous Māori people, particularly in the central North Island (CNI) lakes where large numbers were harvested for consumption and trading. Today, kōura are considered a ‘taonga’ species and support important customary fisheries in some CNI lakes (Rotomā, Rotoiti, Tarawera, and Taupō) where large populations of kōura still exist. Nevertheless, there is considerable anecdotal evidence of declines in populations of kōura in the Te Arawa lakes district since European settlement. A number of environmental factors have been implicated in this decline, including introductions of exotic fish and plant species as well as reduced concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the bottom waters of lakes due to eutrophication. Although the ecology of stream-dwelling P. planifrons is well studied in New Zealand, there is limited published biological information on kōura in lakes. The lack of quantitative information on kōura abundance and ecology makes it difficult for iwi (Māori tribes) and government agencies to manage lake dwelling kōura populations. Until recently the main reason for the lack of quantitative information on lake kōura was the absence of suitable representative sampling methods. In a preliminary study of kōura sampling methods in the Te Arawa lakes, it was found that conventional sampling methods, baited traps, SCUBA and underwater video camera surveys had a number of disadvantages. Trapping was found to be highly biased towards large individuals and complicated by reductions in bait quality with time and changes in natural food abundance. SCUBA and underwater video camera surveys are also biased towards large individuals and are strongly dependent on underwater visibility. Given the disadvantages of these conventional kōura assessment methods, a traditional Māori harvesting method, the tau kōura, was adapted for the monitoring of lake kōura populations. The tau kōura captured large numbers and a wide size range (6 – 50 mm Orbit Carapace Length, OCL) of kōura in both shallow (5 m mean depth) and moderately deep water (10 – 17 m depth) in Ōkere Arm and Te Ākau, Lake Rotoiti, respectively. This method also distinguished differences in size structure and biomass between sites and provided information on sex ratios, egg-bearing and moulting. The development of the tau kōura thus enabled research and monitoring of lake kōura populations that may have not previously been representatively sampled and have generally been little studied in New Zealand despite their ecological and cultural significance. The tau kōura was used to examine population dynamics of kōura, along a eutrophication gradient in seven Te Arawa lakes, in April, July and November 2009. Mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) and depth distribution of kōura were influenced by the combined effects of lake bed sediments, lake morphology, and hypolimnetic conditions related to trophic state. Although limited by the number of lakes that I was able to characterise, my data indicates that lake bed substrate (median sediment particle size) had a stronger influence on population characteristics than the level of enrichment/primary production as indexed by chlorophyll a (Chl-a). Nevertheless, the negative correlations between kōura abundance, with sediment carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N), and the positive correlation between abundance and Chl-a, suggest that lake productivity does influence kōura. This component of the study indicates that eutrophication has reduced available kōura habitat in the Te Arawa lakes, particularly those that are sheltered, steep-sided and have fine lake bed sediments (with the Rotomahana mud tephra being particularly important). Lake bed substrate composition represented by sediment particle size is therefore a key factor to consider when selecting tau kōura sites for research, monitoring, restoration and harvesting, and when estimating kōura stocks in lakes. I concluded that measures to improve water quality in the Te Arawa lakes should benefit kōura populations by increasing the amount of oxygenated habitat available in the summer and autumn. Kōura support important customary fisheries for iwi in some Te Arawa lakes, particularly Rotoiti, Rotomā and Tarawera. However, until recently, there was limited published biological information to provide a basis for fisheries regulations. This knowledge gap has resulted in the adoption of conservative fisheries regulations and management policies by the fishery managers, the Te Arawa Lakes Trust (TALT) and Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI). A further objective of the research was therefore to examine the biological traits of lake kōura and to consider implications of these traits on the current fishing regulations and sustainable management of kōura populations in the Te Arawa lakes. From a review of past literature and the research findings from this study, it can be concluded that kōura populations in the Te Arawa lakes are currently not over-exploited due mostly to a low number participating in harvesting (almost exclusively Te Arawa) and because commercial harvesting is prohibited. However, the TALT wishes to encourage the revitalisation of traditional fishing practices (e. g., tau kōura) while adhering to the principles of kaitiakitanga ‒ the sustainable protection of resources. The establishment of sustainable management policies and regulations adheres to the principles of kaitiakitanga. A number of management changes arising from the information collected in this study are suggested to protect and enhance the kōura fishery in the future. These are (1) set a slot limit with minimum size limit of 28 mm OCL and a maximum size limit of 39 mm OCL, (2) prohibit the taking of egg-bearing females, (3) limit deep-water harvest methods to the use of the tau kōura, and (4) implementing a tau kōura harvest season beginning on 1 December and ending on 31 March. These measures will protect breeding females if they are captured and the closed season will allow the majority of females to breed and release their young <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>fishing</b> activity. Improving water quality (and thus increasing available kōura habitat) and preventing the introduction of predatory fish species such as eels (Anguilla spp.), catfish (Ameiurus nebulosus), and perch (Perca fluviatilis), that are efficient predators of kōura, are of the utmost importance in ensuring the sustainability of kōura populations in the Te Arawa lakes...|$|E

40|$|Active {{metabolic}} suppression {{in anticipation}} of winter conditions has been demonstrated in species of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, but not fish. This is because the reduction in metabolic rate in fish is directly proportional to the decrease in water temperature and {{they appear to be}} incapable of further suppressing their metabolic rate independently of temperature. However, the Antarctic fish (Notothenia coriiceps) is unusual because it undergoes winter metabolic suppression irrespective of water temperature. We assessed the seasonal ecological strategy by monitoring swimming activity, growth, feeding and heart rate (f H) inN. coriiceps as they free-ranged within sub-zero waters. The metabolic rate of wild fish was extrapolated from f H recordings, from oxygen consumption calibrations established in the laboratory <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>fish</b> release. Throughout the summer months N. coriiceps spent a considerable proportion of its time foraging, resulting in a growth rate (Gw) of 0. 1860. 2 % day 21. In contrast, during winter much of the time was spent sedentary within a refuge and fish showed a net loss in G w (20. 0560. 05 % day 21). Whilst inactive during winter, N. coriiceps displayed a very low f H, reduced sensory and motor capabilities, and standard metabolic rate was one third lower than in summer. In a similar manner to other hibernating species, dormancy was interrupted with periodic arousals. These arousals, which lasted a few hours, occurred every 4 – 12 days. During arousal activity, fH and metabolism increased to summer levels. This endogenous suppression and activation of metabolic processes, independent of body temperature, demonstrates that N. coriiceps wer...|$|R
40|$|We {{used the}} {{elemental}} signatures in otoliths of the damselfish Pomacentrus coelestis {{as a proxy}} for conditions experienced <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> settlement. <b>Fish</b> from the southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) differed in their pre-settlement otolith chemistry, indicating that they had occupied different water masses during their pelagic stage, thus suggesting multiple larval sources. Fish from reefs in the northern GBR did not differ greatly in their pre-settlement otolith chemistry, suggesting a single larval source. Using "near-natal" signatures, we determined that ~ 67 % of these signatures matched the signature established for Lizard Island (LZ), suggesting LZ could be a source reef. However, these results could also be the result of poor separation among reefs caused by reefs sharing water masses. Otolith chemistry also revealed that 50 – 70 % of all fish examined settled on the reef the day they encountered it, while some <b>fish</b> spent up <b>to</b> 4 days near the reef <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> settlement...|$|R
40|$|Five {{commonly}} imported freshwater ornamental fish: Poecilia reticulata (guppy); Xiphophorus maculatus (platy); Paracheirodon innesi (neon tetra); Paracheirodon axelrodi (cardinal tetra); and Gyrinocheilus aymonieri (sucking catfish), 361 {{individuals in}} total, were examined for parasites immediately after {{being released from}} quarantine in Australia. Ten parasites species were found: Camallanus cotti; Centrocestus formosanus; Bothriocephalus acheilognathi; Urocleidoides reticulatus; Tetrahymena corlissi; Chilodonella piscicola; Hexamita sp.; Cryptobia sp.; Chloromyxum sp.; and an unidentified larval nematode. Though shipments had come from up to five different exporting companies, parasite prevalence was uniformly high. We suggest that <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> release, <b>fish</b> transported internationally should be checked for high risk pathogens such as Camallanus cotti, B. acheilognathi and Centrocestus formosanus, and treated for common infections such as Hexamita sp., Cryptobia sp. T. corlissi and Chilodonella piscicola to inhibit the spread of disease and enhance {{the survival of the}} fish...|$|R
30|$|<b>Prior</b> <b>to</b> the <b>fish</b> {{advisories}} {{issued in}} the 1980 s, fishing {{had been a}} central part of the diet, economy, and social culture of Akwesasne for centuries. More than just a means of acquiring a dietary mainstay, fishing was described by community members as a livelihood, a lifestyle, and a culture. Almost everyone I spoke to in the community had a connection in some way <b>to</b> <b>fish</b> or fishing. The process of catching and cooking fish out of the river was at the root of many of the interviewees’ childhoods and something that connected them to their ancestors. People in their 50 s on up through their 90 s recalled with youthful excitement their childhood experiences of going <b>to</b> the <b>fish</b> boxes that each family kept on the shore of the river to pull out the evening’s supper. People fondly reminisced about fishing with their fathers on the river, helping their fathers prepare fishing equipment, or helping their mothers clean and cook the fish. Species such as sturgeon, perch, and bullhead were mentioned most frequently, and they were eaten smoked or fried. Fish was eaten several times a week for an ordinary dinner, and in large quantities at “fish fries” to celebrate special occasions and family gatherings.|$|R
