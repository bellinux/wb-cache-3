5000|$|Ecoigo {{exclusively}} use all-black Toyota Prius saloon cars, {{a hybrid}} hatchback developed and manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation, {{as part of}} their London fleet. [...] The Toyota Prius has been rated as one of the cleanest vehicles sold around the world based on smog forming and toxic emissions. With a 5 Star Euro NCAP safety rating and lower emissions than any car in its class, 40% lower than European standards for 2005, and with 87% fewer smog forming particles than an average new <b>petrol</b> <b>only</b> car, it has been calculated that each Prius with carbon dioxide emissions at 89g/km, saves well over a tonne of CO2 a year compared to a normal <b>petrol</b> <b>only</b> car (181g/km), let alone a people carrier or a black taxi (243g/km).|$|E

50|$|Mr Lobb was the {{managing}} director of a small petrol station in South Street, Braintree, Essex. It had to buy <b>petrol</b> <b>only</b> from Total Oil. In 1969 he was in financial difficulty. Contrary to his solicitor's advice, he entered into a lease and lease back arrangement with a new tie agreement with Total Oil. This proved costly. Eventually he paid off debts and ten years after sought the agreement to be set aside as being a restraint of trade and unconscionable.|$|E
5000|$|Annual {{passenger}} vehicle sales in Mexico reached the one million milestone in 2005. The increasing sales figures encouraged carmakers to offer cars with alternative fuels like the Honda Civic Hybrid and the Volkswagen Jetta TDI. Such cars hadn't been available in Mexico {{since the first}} diesel-powered Volkswagen Caribe in the late 70's and early 80's (see paragraphs for each maker: Honda and Volkswagen); still few carmakers have released their diesel-powered versions in the Mexican market due to stricter government emissions laws {{than those of the}} European Union Euro IV standard. This results in a <b>petrol</b> <b>ONLY</b> car market in which drivers cannot reap the potential benefits of diesel automobiles. Diesel cars are not suited/permitted for every day driving in Mexico City; brand new diesel vehicles face the [...] "Hoy no Circula" [...] restrictions.|$|E
50|$|The Junkers L1 was {{the first}} engine from that company to fly. It was an air-cooled, upright 6-cylinder inline 4-stroke <b>petrol</b> engine <b>only</b> {{produced}} in small numbers and largely used for research, but led to the successful L5 and its V-12 development, the L55.|$|R

50|$|This {{model has}} a J24B 2.4 litre petrol engine with 4 cylinders, 16 valves DOHC. The 2400 cc engine {{is capable of}} {{producing}} 185 hp of peak power at 6,500 rpm (manual transmission) and 180 hp at 6,000 rpm (CVT). It produces 170 lbÂ·ft of peak torque at 4,000 rpm. The Maruti Kizashi utilizes a direct ignition system for increased fuel efficiency with decreased emissions. With the help of this and other engine technologies, the car gives 9 km/L {{in the city and}} 12 km/L on the highway. The fuel tank capacity of the car is 63 L. Maruti Suzuki though, {{has not been able to}} sell many units since the Kizashi is <b>petrol</b> <b>only</b> (running a petrol car in India is expensive compared to a diesel), and the fact that it is expensive there.|$|E
5000|$|The chassis {{featured}} a triple bulkhead monocoque {{made of a}} composite of carbon fibre and aluminium honeycomb, which was manufactured by the Lille-based SNPE company. The bodywork was quite bulky, as the sidepods housed large water and oil coolers. The GD-01 had a conventional suspension, featuring wishbones with pushrod-actuated shock absorbers. The car {{featured a}} low-nose configuration, which was gradually being abandoned in favour of higher noses by other F1 teams at the time, although the Reynard engineers had tested both configurations. The car's overall aerodynamic package {{has been described by}} motorsport author Sam Collins as [...] "underdeveloped". The GD-01 was powered by a Ford Cosworth ED V8 engine - a new unit for the three-litre era of F1 that began in 1995 - which was a standard contemporary choice for smaller teams due to its low cost and ease of installation. The engine had a mileage of 400 mi before rebuilds, a weight of 129.5 kg, a rev limit of 13,500 rpm, and maximum power of [...] at 13,200 rpm. It was initially thought that the chassis would be powered by a Mugen-Honda engine as part of a low-key return to F1 for Honda, but negotiations between the parties came to nought. The car's transmission was a six-speed sequential unit built specially for the team by British company Xtrac, which also supplied the team's differential. Xtrac gearboxes were also used in the Minardi M195 and Simtek S951 chassis in 1995. The car's electronics were supplied by Pi Research, its Goodyear-supplied tyres fitted on Enkei wheels, and it was fuelled with Elf <b>petrol.</b> <b>Only</b> one chassis was built.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{reports on}} Molotov {{cocktail}} {{cases in the}} local media has warrant {{a need for a}} detailed investigation of the perpetrator of the crime. A study is therefore embarked to compare fingerprint quality recovered from glass fragments of Molotov cocktails. The accelerants used were petrol, kerosene, diesel and motor oil. Different types of accelerant were used to observe the effect of accelerant on the quality of fingerprint recovered from glass fragment of Molotov cocktails. In the study, Molotov cocktails were exploded and glass fragments bearing fingerprint marks were collected and transported back to laboratory for analysis. Prior to fingerprint analysis, soot were removed from glass fragment using three techniques of brushing, NaOH (2 %) wash solution and tape lifting. After soot removal, enhancement fingerprint were done by using methods such as dusting method, superglue fuming method and Small Particle Reagent (SPR) method. Then, fingerprints from glass fragment of Molotov cocktails were identified by manual matching. Powder dusting method was used for sample <b>petrol</b> <b>only</b> because most of glass fragment were obtained in dry condition. Other than that, superglue fuming method was used in majority of sample whether Molotov cocktails were allowed to burn out naturally or the fire was extinguished using water. Small particle reagent method was mostly used for the wet glass fragment. Fingerprints recovered were photographed and were sent for manual matching. Based on the enhancement fingerprint method used, most of the latent fingerprint was developed with various qualities. Based on the percent recovery, SPR method shows the best recovery (43. 75 %) at the scale 3 fingerprint, followed by superglue fuming and dusting powder. In manual matching method, percentage success rate in the case where fire of Molotov cocktails was allowed to burn out naturally was 55. 56 % while in the case of fire extinguished using water, percentage success rate was 33. 33 %. This study also showed that manual matching method of fingerprints recovered from Molotov cocktails with fingerprint obtained from suspect or standard can be done...|$|E

50|$|Paraffin is less {{volatile}} than petrol, {{and will}} not normally ignite at ambient temperatures, so the petrol-paraffin engine is started using <b>petrol,</b> and <b>only</b> when the engine has attained a sufficient operating temperature will the engine be switched to paraffin.

50|$|Jazira Canton is home {{to several}} oil fields, among them Syria's best {{producing}} at Rmelan. As of summer 2016, oil output in Jazira Canton was estimated at around 40,000 barrels per day. Some people work at primitive oil refining, which causes health hazards and pollution. The oil wealth {{in combination with the}} economic blockade of Rojava from the adjacent territories controlled by Turkey and ISIL, and partially also the KRG, results in a distortion of relative prices; <b>petrol</b> costs <b>only</b> half as much as bottled water.|$|R
