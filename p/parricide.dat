5|$|The Roman {{historian}} Livy {{places the}} execution of Malleolus to just about 10 years earlier than the composition of Rhetoricia ad Herennium (i.e., roughly 100 BCE) and claims, furthermore, that Malleolus {{was the first in}} Roman history who was convicted to be sewn into a sack and thrown into the water, on account of <b>parricide.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{it is seen}} in {{the time}} of Emperor Hadrian (r.117–138 CE), the {{punishment}} for <b>parricide</b> was basically made optional, in that the convict might be thrown into the arena instead. Furthermore, a rescript from Hadrian is preserved in the fourth century CE grammarian Dositheus Magister that contains the information that the cart with the sack and its live contents was driven by black oxen.|$|E
5|$|The 19th-century {{historian}} Theodor Mommsen compiled {{and described}} in detail the various elements {{that at one time}} or another have been asserted as elements within the ritualistic execution of a <b>parricide</b> during the Roman Era. The following paragraph is based on that description, it is not to be regarded as a static ritual that always was observed, but as a descriptive enumeration of elements gleaned from several sources written over a period of several centuries. Mommsen, for example, notes that the monkey hardly can have been an ancient element in the execution ritual.|$|E

25|$|Home {{demolition}} {{was often}} {{employed by the}} state as a means of punishing crimes regarded as exceptionally dishonourable. In a number of medieval European countries, the relatives of those convicted of offences such as incest, sodomy, <b>parricide</b> or treason were sometimes collectively punished by having their homes demolished and their possessions confiscated. Patricide was similarly treated as an offence of exceptional seriousness in Qing Dynasty China; the offender would be executed, his house razed and the earth beneath it dug up. In 18th century Korea, anyone convicted of committing treason or other major offences against the king was punished with the utmost severity; he would be executed along with his entire family, their home would be destroyed and all the contents and possessions confiscated, and nobody else would be permitted to build {{on the site of the}} razed house.|$|E

John tries to approach him, but slips and {{falls into the}} sea. He is saved from drowning by the sole survivor of the wreck, a Spaniard Alonzo Monçada. Alonzo Monçada tells his story, in which his family confines him to a monastery. He is mistreated by the monks, and his brother Juan arranges for him to escape {{with the help of}} a fellow monk, a <b>parricide.</b> The escape plan is a trap and Juan is killed. Monçada is taken to the prison of the Inquisition. There he is visited in his cell by Melmoth, who says he will help him escape. A fire breaks out, and in the confusion Monçada escapes. He meets a venerable Jewish scholar, Adonijah, who lives in a secret chamber decorated with the skeletons of his own family. In exchange for food and shelter, Adonijah compels Monçada to transcribe a manuscript for him: 'the Tale of the Indians'.|$|E
500|$|Two laws {{documented}} {{from the}} first BCE are principally relevant to Roman murder legislation in general, and legislation on <b>parricide</b> in particular. These are the Lex Cornelia De Sicariis, promulgated in the 80s BCE, and the Lex Pompeia de Parricidiis promulgated about 55 BCE. According to a 19th-century commentator, the relation between these two old laws might have been {{that it was the}} Lex Pompeia that specified the poena cullei (i.e., sewing the convict up in a sack and throwing him in the water) as the particular punishment for a <b>parricide,</b> because a direct reference to the [...] "Lex Cornelia" [...] shows that the typical punishment for a poisoner/assassin in general (rather than for the specific crime of <b>parricide)</b> was that of deportation/banishment, i.e., Lex Pompeia makes explicit distinctions for the crime of <b>parricide</b> not present in Lex Cornelia.|$|E

500|$|The Catechism states: [...] "Human life {{is sacred}} because from its {{beginning}} {{it involves the}} creative action of God and it remains forever in a special relationship with the Creator, who is its sole end.... no one can under any circumstance claim for himself the right directly to destroy an innocent human being." [...] Direct and intentional killing of an innocent human is considered a mortal sin. Considered by the Church to be of an even greater gravity is the murder of family members, including [...] "infanticide, fratricide, <b>parricide,</b> {{the murder of a}} spouse and procured abortion." ...|$|E
500|$|Whereas the {{influence}} of Greek tragedies {{is clear from the}} choice of title, the absent father, and the roles of incest and <b>parricide,</b> Littell makes it clear that he was influenced by more than the structure of The Oresteia. He found that the idea of morality in Ancient Greece is more relevant for making judgments about responsibility for the Holocaust than the Judeo-Christian approach, wherein the idea of sin can be blurred by the concepts such as intentional sin, unintentional sin, sinning by thought, or sinning by deed. For the Greeks it was the commission of the act itself upon which one is judged: Oedipus is guilty of patricide, even if he did not know that he was killing his father.|$|E
500|$|The historians Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Valerius Maximus, {{connect the}} {{practice}} of poena cullei with an alleged incident under king Tarquinius Superbus (legendary reign being 535–509 BCE). During his reign, the Roman state apparently acquired the so-called Sibylline Oracles, books of prophecy and sacred rituals [...] The king appointed a couple of priests, the so-called Duumviri sacrorum, to guard the books, but one of them, Marcus Atilius, was bribed, and in consequence, divulged some of the book's secrets (to a certain Sabine foreigner Petronius, according to Valerius). For that breach of religion, Tarquinius had him sewn up in a sack and thrown him on the sea. According to Valerius Maximus, it was very long after this event that this punishment was instituted for the crime of <b>parricide</b> as well, whereas Dionysius says {{that in addition to}} be suspected of divulging the secret texts, Atilius was, indeed, accused of having killed his own father.|$|E

500|$|Poena cullei (from Latin 'penalty of the sack') under Roman law was a type {{of death}} penalty imposed on a subject who had been found guilty of <b>parricide.</b> The {{punishment}} consisted of being sewn up in a leather sack, sometimes {{with an assortment of}} live animals, and then being thrown into water. The punishment may have varied widely in its frequency and precise form during the Roman period. For example, the earliest fully documented case is from ca. 100BCE, although scholars think the punishment may have developed about a century earlier (earlier than that, murderers, including parricides, would be handed over to the aggrieved family for punishment, rather than punishment being enacted by Roman state officials). Inclusion of live animals in the sack [...] is only documented from Early Imperial times, and at the beginning, only snakes are mentioned. At the time of Emperor Hadrian (2nd century CE), the most well known form of the punishment was documented, where a cock, a dog, a monkey and a viper were inserted in the sack. However, at the time of Hadrian poena cullei was made into an optional form of punishment for parricides (the alternate being thrown to the beasts in the arena). During the 3rd century CE up to the accession of Emperor Constantine, poena cullei fell out of use; Constantine revived it, now with only serpents to be added in the sack. Well over 200years later, Emperor Justinian reinstituted the punishment with the four animals, and poena cullei remained the statutory penalty for parricides within Byzantine law for the next 400years, when it was replaced with the punishment for parricides to be burnt alive instead.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{collection}} of twelve anecdotes dealing with assaults on chastity, the historian Valerius Maximus features male victims in equal number to female. In a [...] "mock trial" [...] case described by the elder Seneca, an adulescens (a man young enough not to have begun his formal career) was gang-raped by ten of his peers; although the case is hypothetical, Seneca assumes that the law permitted the successful prosecution of the rapists. Another hypothetical case imagines the extremity to which a rape victim might be driven: the freeborn male (ingenuus) who was raped commits suicide. The Romans considered the rape of an ingenuus {{to be among the}} worst crimes that could be committed, along with <b>parricide,</b> the rape of a female virgin, and robbing a temple.|$|E

2500|$|During this time, Jeffers {{published}} {{volumes of}} long narrative blank verse that shook up the national literary scene.

These poems were full of controversial subject matter such as incest, murder and <b>parricide.</b> Jeffers' short verse includes [...] "Hurt Hawks," [...] "The Purse-Seine" [...] and [...] "Shine, Perishing Republic." [...] His intense relationship with the physical world is described in often brutal and apocalyptic verse, and demonstrates a preference for the natural world over what he sees as the negative influence of civilization. Jeffers did not accept the idea that meter is a fundamental part of poetry, and, like Marianne Moore, claimed his verse was not composed in meter, but [...] "rolling stresses." [...] He believed meter was imposed on poetry by man and not a fundamental part of its nature.|$|E

He is given a reward, but also expelled and put on a ship, for the act of <b>parricide.</b> He lands on Ratnadeepa (Lanka, the [...] "island of gems"), and settles there. He starts attacking naval merchants, who come to the island looking for gems. He captures the children of these merchants, and spares their lives, thus creating a community. Chih-sse-tseu himself has children (although their mother is not named), and his descendants divide people into classes, giving rise to the caste system. They also wage wars, expanding their territory. The community established by Chih-sse-tseu gives rise to the Sinhalese race. There {{is no mention of}} Yakkhas in this version.|$|E
2500|$|When Servius Tullius {{arrived at}} the senate-house to defend his position, Tarquinius threw him {{down the steps and}} Servius was murdered in the street by Tarquin's men. Soon after, Tullia drove her chariot over her father's body. For Livy, Tarquinius' [...] impious refusal to permit his father-in-law's burial earned him the sobriquet [...] "Superbus" [...] (arrogant or proud), and Servius' death is a [...] "tragic crime" [...] (tragicum scelus), a dark episode in Rome's history and just cause for the {{abolition}} of the monarchy. Servius thus becomes the last of Rome's benevolent kings; the place of this outrage [...] which Livy seems to suggest as a crossroads [...] is known thereafter as Vicus Sceleratus (street of shame, infamy or crime). His murder is <b>parricide,</b> the worst of all crimes. This morally justifies Tarquin's eventual expulsion and the abolition of Rome's aberrant, [...] "un-Roman" [...] monarchy. Livy's Republic is partly founded on the achievements and death of Rome's last benevolent king.|$|E
