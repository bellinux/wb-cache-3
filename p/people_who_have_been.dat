5|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is a {{risk factor}} for pancreatic cancer and (as noted in the Signs and symptoms section) new-onset diabetes may also be an early sign of the disease. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> diagnosed with Type2 diabetes for longer than ten years may have a 50% increased risk, as compared with non-diabetics.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{lead exposure}} {{is associated with}} high blood pressure, and studies have also found connections between lead exposure and coronary heart disease, heart rate variability, and death from stroke, but this evidence is more limited. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> exposed to higher concentrations of lead may be at a higher risk for cardiac autonomic dysfunction on days when ozone and fine particles are higher.|$|E

5|$|In May 2011, Gillard {{announced}} that Australia and Malaysia were finalising an arrangement to exchange asylum seekers. Gillard and Immigration Minister Chris Bowen {{said they were}} close to signing a bilateral agreement which would result in 800 asylum seekers who arrive in Australia by boat being taken to Malaysia instead. Australia would take 4,000 people from Malaysia who have previously been assessed as being refugees. However, on 31 August, the High Court ruled that the agreement to transfer refugees from Australia to Malaysia was invalid, and ordered that it not proceed. Australia would still accept 4,000 <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> assessed as refugees in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Not all gallstones {{implicated in}} {{ascending}} cholangitis actually originate from the gallbladder, but cholecystectomy (surgical {{removal of the}} gallbladder) is generally recommended in <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> treated for cholangitis due to gallstone disease. This is typically delayed until all symptoms have resolved and ERCP or MRCP have confirmed that the bile duct is clear of gallstones. Those who do not undergo cholecystectomy have {{an increased risk of}} recurrent biliary pain, jaundice, further episodes of cholangitis, and need for further ERCP or cholecystostomy; the risk of death is also significantly increased.|$|E

The Alexander Maconochie Centre was officially opened on 11 September 2008 by then Chief Minister Jon Stanhope. The total cost for construction was $130million. Courts such as a Small Claims Tribunal and a Family Court exist for civil law actions and other non-criminal legal matters.|$|E

In times of public emergency, the Governor may exercise emergency powers, including the mobilization of these military forces.

5|$|Tonsillectomy {{may be a}} {{reasonable}} preventive measure in those with frequent throat infections (more than three a year). However, the benefits are small and episodes typically lessen in time regardless of measures taken. Recurrent episodes of pharyngitis which test positive for GAS may also represent {{a person who is}} a chronic carrier of GAS who is getting recurrent viral infections. Treating <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> exposed but who are without symptoms is not recommended. Treating people who are carriers of GAS is not recommended as the risk of spread and complications is low.|$|E

40|$|Delirium {{occurs as}} a {{consequence}} of physiological imbalances resulting in alterations in consciousness and cognitive impairment. It is a serious cognitive disorder and one prevalent in older people. This paper presents a significant finding from a study that critically examined the major discourses circulating on delirium and the subject positions offered to older <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> delirious. A qualitative research design utilizing a critical gerontological framework underpinned this study. Data sources included published documents on delirium and semi-structured taped interviews. A discourse analytic approach interrogated the 20 sets of data collected. Textual analysis revealed the existence of an ageist discourse. Consequently, older <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> delirious were offered the subject positions of ‘being old doesn’t matter’ and ‘a second childhood’. However, results from this study identified times when <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> delirious resisted the ageist discourse. Resistance to the dominant discourse, although subtle and occurring on a micro level, acted to destabilize and challenge ageist and discriminatory health practices...|$|R
