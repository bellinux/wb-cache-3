The targeted configuration {{is composed of}} ZnO NWs/PVDF polymer ink pasted and sandwiched between two pieces of paper with ZnO NWs grown chemically {{on one side of}} each piece of paper. Other configurations utilizing a ZnO/PVDF ink with different ZnO morphologies on <b>paper</b> <b>platform</b> and others on plastic platform were fabricated for comparison. The mechanical pressure exerted on the <b>paper</b> <b>platform</b> while handwriting is then harvested by the ZnO NWs/polymer based NG to deliver electrical energy. Two handwriting modes were tested; these were slow (low pressure) and fast (high pressure) handwriting. The maximum achieved harvested open circuit voltage was 4. 8 V. While an out power density as high as 1. 3 mW/mm(2) was estimated when connecting the NG to a 100 Omega load resistor. The observed results were stable and reproducible. The present NG provides a low cost and scalable approach with many potential applications, like e. g. programmable paper for signature verification...|$|E
30|$|Overall, fluorogenic-based detection, {{especially}} {{in conjunction with}} nanotechnology, has shown increasing trends in translation to low-cost and easy-to-use paper-based platforms due to its superior emission intensities, assay specificity, time-dependent resolvement, and superior storage life. Smartphone-based optical sensing of fluorescence emission is of recent development and has shown numerous technical and physical limitations, especially on <b>paper</b> <b>platforms.</b> However, recent implementation of filters, advanced image processing, and unique platform development show improved results to better address such challenges. Hopefully in the near future, the benefits of contact CMOS imagers could also be incorporated into smartphone-based fluorescence sensing on paper-based platforms.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} for {{the first}} time the fabrication of pencil drawn electrodes (PDE) on <b>paper</b> <b>platforms</b> for capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection ((CD) -D- 4) on electrophoresis microchips. PDE-(CD) -D- 4 devices were attached on PMMA electrophoresis chips and used for detection of K+ and Na+ in human tear samples. PDE-(CD) -D- 4 devices were produced on office paper and chromatographic <b>paper</b> <b>platforms</b> and their performance were thoroughly investigated using a model mixture containing K+, Na+, and Li+. In comparison with chromatographic paper, PDE-(CD) -D- 4 fabricated on office paper has exhibited better performance due to its higher electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the detector response was similar to that recorded with electrodes prepared with copper adhesive tape. The fabrication of PDE-(CD) -D- 4 on office paper has offered great advantages including extremely low cost (< $ 0. 004 per unit), reduced fabrication time (< 5 min), and minimal instrumentation (pencil and paper). The proposed electrodes demonstrated excellent analytical performance with good reproducibility. For an inter-PDE comparison (n = 7), the RSD values for migration time, peak area, and separation efficiency were lower than 2. 5, 10. 5, and 14 %, respectively. The LOD's achieved for K+, Na+, and Li+ were 4. 9, 6. 8, and 9. 0 M, respectively. The clinical feasibility of the proposed approach was successfully demonstrated with the quantitative analysis of K+ and Na+ in tear samples. The concentration levels found for K+ and Na+ were, respectively, 20. 8 +/- 0. 1 mM and 101. 2 +/- 0. 1 mM for sample # 1, and 20. 4 +/- 0. 1 mM and 111. 4 +/- 0. 1 mM for sample #...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{two examples}} of how shared technical support platforms are adapted and developed in organizations. One is support for object oriented design and programming, the other, production of documents in an office. These two cases represent longitudinal studies of the use, the adaptation {{and the development of}} these platforms. This development involved active mediation of platform coordinators, who were users of the shared environment, {{at the same time as}} they possessed, and developed further, skills and procedures to undertake its continued development. The paper applies a developmental perspective in that its concern is how the technical platform and the work practices surrounding it, are developing over time, and how the technical and organizational conditions have been in support of or a hindrance to this development. Tailoring and platform coordination The development in use of technical platforms is in literature often called tailoring.

Low-cost, paper-based device is an emerging opportunity in diagnostics. In the present study, we report a novel Zinc oxide nanorods functionalized <b>paper</b> <b>platform</b> for the preconcentration of Myoglobin, a cardiac biomarker. Zinc oxide nanorods were grown on a Whatman filter paper no. 1 via the standard hydrothermal route.

The Zinc oxide nanorods modified Whatman filter paper (ZnO-NRs/WFP) was further tested for use as a protein preconcentrator. Paper-based ELISA was performed for determination of pre-concentration of cardiac marker protein Myoglobin using the new ZnO-NRs/WFP platform. The ZnO-NRs/WFP could efficiently capture the biomarker even from a very dilute solution (Myoglobin < 50 nM). Our ELISA results show a threefold enhancement in protein capture with ZnO-NRs/WFP compared to unmodified Whatman filter paper, allowing accurate protein analysis and showing the diagnostic concept...|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} {{microfluidics}} is expanding {{into what is}} known as paper microfluidics. This uses a <b>paper</b> <b>platform</b> rather than materials (i. e. PDMS, PMMA) that are commonly used in microfluidics research. Current devices require an expensive manufacturing process and external sources to power the device. Such devices are not practical in low resource environments. As a consequence, it is the goal of this Thesis to develop a three-dimensional, multiplexed assay chip using nitrocellulose membranes. This device comprises of multiple layers of nitrocellulose membranes with defined fluidic channels. The multiple layers are bound together using double backed tape, and imbedded between the layers are conjugate reagents. In the detection region both antibodies and aptamers were evaluated. The fiberglass pad where conjugate reagents would be contained, were initially saturated in dye. As sample was inputted into the three-dimensional chip, the fluid path could be visualized. Without the use of the conjugate pad the chip’s four detection regions showed detection within one minute of one another. However, the addition of this fibrous pad skewed time points dramatically. The hypothesis that a three-dimensional chip could be designed to detect different biomarkers in a multi-analyte sample was satisfied. However, simultaneous detection was only possible if the conjugate pad was either neglected or, possibly, a different material was used. Additionally, current lateral flow assay technologies, another research area that paper microfluidics spawns from, use antibodies in order to capture biomarkers in sample and provide visual signal to the user. However, antibodies are sensitive to denaturation with pH and temperature, whereas aptamers can withstand much more extreme environmental conditions. A two-dimensional nitrocellulose chip was designed to compare antibodies and aptamers as capture reagents to detect VEGF, using colloidal gold as a particle to visualize detection. Both monoclonal and polyclonal anti-VEGF antibodies were used and showed no signal. On the other hand, the anti-VEGF aptamer produced a visual signal when conjugated to biotin on its 5 ’ end. This data was further validated by a separate project analyzing the binding kinetics of the antibody and the aptamer using Surface Plasmon Resonance. Therefore, the hypothesis that aptamers {{could be used as a}} possible capture reagent in a paper microfluidic chip for the detection of VEGF was satisfied...|$|E

With the addition of fluorescent detection method for an analyte (protein, cell, or nucleic acid), a light source is required. When using fluorogenics, specific excitation wavelengths are important in order to obtain the desired emission spectra. This being the case, most smartphone-based fluorescent assays incorporate external light sources, the most popular being a handheld UV lamp or separate LED [52, 59, 60]. Taking this into account, various platforms have been designed to accessorize and power an external light source with a specific wavelength needed for fluorescent sensing on <b>paper</b> <b>platforms.</b>|$|R
