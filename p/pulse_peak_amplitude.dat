40|$|This {{invention}} {{is comprised}} of a radiation detection method and system for continuously correcting the quantization of detected charge during pulse pile-up conditions. Charge pulses from a radiation detector responsive to the energy of detected radiation events are converted to voltage pulses of predetermined shape whose peak amplitudes are proportional to the quantity of charge of each corresponding detected event {{by means of a}} charge-sensitive preamplifier. These peak amplitudes are sampled and stored sequentially in accordance with their respective times of occurrence. Based on the stored peak amplitudes and times of occurrence, a correction factor is generated which represents the fraction of a previous pulses influence on a preceding <b>pulse</b> <b>peak</b> <b>amplitude.</b> This correction factor is subtracted from the following pulse amplitude in a summing amplifier whose output then represents the corrected charge quantity measurement...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to develop}} a new method to monitor {{peripheral}} arterial pulse using a PVDF piezoelectric sensor. After comparing different locations of sensor placement, a specific sensor wrap for the finger was developed. Its composition, size, and location make it inexpensive and very convenient to use. In order to monitor the effectiveness of the sensor at producing a reliable pulse waveform, a monitoring system, including the PZT sensor, ECG, pulse-oximeter, respiratory sensor, and accelerometer was setup. Signal analysis from the system helped discover that the PZT waveform is relative to the 1 st derivative of the artery pressure wave. Also, the system helped discover that the first, second, and third peaks in PZT waveform represent the pulse peak, inflection point, and dicrotic notch respectively. The relationship between PZT wave and respiration was also analyzed, and, consequently, an algorithm to derive respiratory rate directly from the PZT waveform was developed. This algorithm gave a 96 % estimating accuracy. Another feature of the sensor is that by analyzing the relationship between <b>pulse</b> <b>peak</b> <b>amplitude</b> and blood pressure change, temporal artery blood pressure can be predicted during Valsalva maneuver. PZT pulse wave monitoring offers a new type of pulse waveform which is not yet fully understood. Future studies will lead to a more broadly applied use of PZT sensors in cardiac monitoring applications...|$|E

40|$|For {{measurements}} of the statistical distribution of parameters of <b>pulses</b> (<b>peak</b> <b>amplitude,</b> etc.), a technique is introduced to measure accurately the background due to pulses not correlated {{in time to the}} events of interest. This technique is applicable when an event marker signal, correlated in time to the events of interest, is available, i. e., always in time measurements and often in other cases. The basic principle is to make cycles of two successive measurements, in which the probability of measuring a background pulse is the same for both, while the one of measuring an event pulse is much higher in the first measurement; the results of the two measurements must be treated differently. The technique and its applications to amplitude and time measurements are considered in detail. The instrument developed is presented together with some experimental results...|$|R

The resulting phase diagram shows large regions of unidirectional vortex core switching where the switching threshold is modulated due to resonant amplification of azimuthal spin waves. The switching behavior changes dramatically depending on whether the first pulse is applied in the x- or the y-direction. This asymmetry can be reproduced by three-dimensional micromagnetic simulations but not by two-dimensional simulations. This behavior demonstrates that in contrast to previous experiments on vortex core reversal the three-dimensionality in the dynamics is essential here...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFemale {{evaluation}} of male signals {{in the context}} of sexual selection is often {{made on the basis of}} signal energy. Particularly in acoustic species, females may prefer male song that is broadcast at greater amplitude or power. However, song amplitude may be represented by various parameters, and the specific one(s) that are evaluated are not clear. We addressed this problem in an acoustic moth, Achroia grisella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), where males attract females with trains of paired ultrasonic pulses. Previous studies showed that females prefer songs that include pulse pairs that have greater mean <b>peak</b> <b>amplitude</b> and that are delivered with greater power (mean <b>peak</b> <b>amplitude</b> pulse-pair rate). Here, we report that given male songs of equal acoustic power, females prefer songs in which some <b>pulses</b> attain <b>peak</b> <b>amplitudes</b> that exceed the mean value and that this preference depends largely on the magnitude of amplitude fluctuation. We measured significant variation among males in their degree of amplitude fluctuation, and we note that males that broadcast with lower acoustic power typically show greater relative fluctuations and attain relatively higher amplitude maxima. We discuss the potential role of multiple integration time constants in female {{evaluation of}} mean song amplitude and amplitude maxima. We then consider the possibility that the variation observed in the male population is a response to female choice, but we also indicate that mechanical factors constraining song production may be responsible for such variation...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} incoherent perturbations on atomic photoionization due to a femtosecond mid-infrared laser pulse by solving the time-dependent stochastic Schrödinger equation. For a weak laser pulse which causes almost no ionization, an addition of a Gaussian white noise to the pulse leads to a significantly enhanced ionization probability.

40|$|We {{present in}} this paper the design, {{fabrication}} and verification of a us-range pulse generator based on a Step Recovery Diode (SRD). This device needs only a 5 V DC power supply, delivers 1 ns <b>pulses</b> with <b>peak</b> <b>amplitudes</b> in excess of 4 V and features {{state of the art}} jitter figures. In addition, the pulser contains a trigger channel. The long standing problem of the SRD simulation via circuital analysis is addressed. It is shown that the dynamic properties of the Step Recovery Diode can accurately be reproduced via a small signal circuital simulation for the rise times needed in a ns-range pulser. It is also demonstrated that strong inaccuracies in the pulse shape prediction are obtained if the wave propagation through the lines typically used in this type of circuits is simulated by a simple Transverse Electromagnetic Mode (TEM) line model. Instead, it is necessary to account for non-TEM effects. By means of broadband resistive power splitters and high dynamic range amplifiers, a prototype of 4 channels was also fabricated. This prototype is particularly useful for testing the readout electronics of Cherenkov Telescopes, but additional applications to other large-scale experiments are expected, any of those where calibration or verification with compact us-range pulsers featuring low jitter, large dynamic ranges and multichannel operation is needed. In addition, the fabrication cost of this pulser is almost negligible as compared with bulky, commercially available waveform generators, which rarely deliver ns pulses in excess of 3 V. Furthermore, the small size of the pulser presented here and its low power consumption allow an easy integration into more complex systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Basally, some healthy older men exhibited evidence of neuroendocrine dysfunction, reflected by irregular bursts of bioactive LH release followed by transiently low plasma bio:immuno (B:I) LH ratios. However, mean basal plasma bioactive LH concentrations, B:I ratios, and spontaneous LH <b>pulse</b> properties (<b>peak</b> frequency, <b>amplitude,</b> duration, and enhanced B:I ratios within LH peaks) were not altered in older men. On the other hand, augmentation of bioactive LH secretion and enhancement of plasma B:I ratios by pulsed injections of exogenous GnRH were either significantly reduced or absent in older men. In addition, although tamoxifen increased bioactive LH pulse frequency in both age groups and facilitated exogenous GnRH action in some subjects, older men increased their 12 -h mean bioactive LH concentrations, B:I ratios, and bioactive LH <b>peak</b> <b>amplitudes</b> to a significantly lesser degree than young men. In summary, young and older healthy men exhibit similar mean basal plasma bioactive LH concentrations and spontaneous LH pulse properties. However, pituitary bioactive LH reserve is markedly attenuated in older men challenged with either exogenous GnRH or antiestrogen.

Here, we employ intense THz pulses in two ways to enter the regime of nonlinear THz-spin interaction. In the first approach, we use the magnetic field of intense THz pulses with amplitudes of up to 0. 4 T and frequencies between 0. 3 and 2 THz to exert a resonant Zeeman torque onto the spins of nickel oxide (NiO). THz-induced magnetic dynamics is monitored by magneto-optical effects that act on the polarization of ultrashort near-infrared laser pulses. In the second approach, we demonstrate this novel concept of spin excitation in the weak ferromagnet thulium orthoferrite (TmFeO 3). In this material, the magnetic anisotropy for the Fe spins is set by electronic orbitals of the Tm ions. THz transients can resonantly excite transitions between these orbital states and thus modify the anisotropy field. We expose a single crystal of TmFeO 3 to ultrashort THz <b>pulses</b> of variable <b>peak</b> <b>amplitudes</b> and trace the THz-induced magnetization.

Here we analyze the performance of glycinergic connections between the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and the lateral superior olive (LSO) in the auditory brainstem, where high spike rates as well as fast and precise neurotransmission are hallmarks. Analysis was performed in acute mouse slices shortly after hearing onset (postnatal day (P) 11) and eight days later (P 19). Stimulation was done at 37 °C with 1 – 400 Hz for 40 s. Moreover, in a novel approach named marathon experiments, a very prolonged stimulation protocol was employed, comprising 10 trials of 1 -min challenge and 1 -min recovery periods at 50 Hz and 1 Hz, respectively, thus lasting up to 20 min and amounting to > 30, 000 stimulus <b>pulses.</b> IPSC <b>peak</b> <b>amplitudes</b> displayed short-term depression (STD) and synaptic attenuation in a frequency-dependent manner. No facilitation was observed. STD in the MNTB-LSO connections was less pronounced than reported in the upstream calyx of Held-MNTB connections. At P 11, the STD level and the failure rate were slightly lower within the ms-to-s range than at P 19. During prolonged stimulation periods lasting 40 s, P 19 connections sustained virtually failure-free transmission up to frequencies of 100 Hz, whereas P 11 connections did so only up to 50 Hz. In marathon experiments, P 11 synapses recuperated reproducibly from synaptic attenuation during all recovery periods, demonstrating a robust synaptic machinery at hearing onset. At 26 °C, transmission was severely impaired and comprised abnormally high amplitudes after minutes of silence, indicative of imprecisely regulated vesicle pools. Our study takes a fresh look at synaptic plasticity and stability by extending conventional stimulus periods in the ms-to-s range to minutes. It also provides a framework for future analyses of synaptic plasticity...|$|R

R <b>peak</b> <b>amplitude</b> is 16. 0 dB SPL and 3. 1 Hz for frequency. These results indicate high validity and consistency of E. E. R characteristics measurements. 5 - E. E. R <b>peak</b> <b>amplitude</b> is significantly ccre 1 ated {{with the presence of}} type B tympanogram (p- 0. 00) we find a 6. 9 dB SPL increase in average E. E. R <b>peak</b> <b>amplitude</b> in boys with type B tympanograms in comparison to boys with type A results but correlation of average E. E. R peak frequency of two groups is significant too (p= 0. 00). The results are valid only within the context of this research. The results of this research have been compared with similar studies in abroad...|$|R
