The obtained results indicate that the selectivity of commercial zeolites was improved. However, zeolite active life-time was decreased. The locally synthesized high-silica zeolite has shown better performance than the commercially available ones. Analysis of used (deactivated) samples proved that carbon deposition is the main Factor affecting catalyst activity and selectivity.
