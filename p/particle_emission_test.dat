40|$|Coal Tech Corp's {{mission is}} to develop, license & sell innovative, lowest cost, solid fuel fired power systems & total {{emission}} control processes using proprietary and patented technology for domestic and international markets. The present project 'DEVELOPMENT & TESTING OF INDUSTRIAL SCALE, COAL FIRED COMBUSTION SYSTEM, PHASE 3 ' on DOE Contract DE-AC 22 - 91 PC 91162 was {{a key element in}} achieving this objective. The project consisted of five tasks that were divided into three phases. The first phase, 'Optimization of First Generation 20 MMBtu/hr Air-Cooled Slagging Coal Tech Combustor', consisted of three tasks, which are detailed in Appendix 'A' of this report. They were implemented in 1992 and 1993 at the first generation, 20 MMBtu/hour, combustor-boiler test site in Williamsport, PA. It consisted of substantial combustor modifications and coal-fired tests designed to improve the combustor's wall cooling, slag and ash management, automating of its operation, and correcting severe deficiencies in the coal feeding to the combustor. The need for these changes was indicated during the prior 900 -hour test effort on this combustor that was conducted as part of the DOE Clean Coal Program. A combination of combustor changes, auxiliary equipment changes, sophisticated multi-dimensional combustion analysis, computer controlled automation, and series of single and double day shift tests totaling about 300 hours, either resolved these operational issues or indicated that further corrective changes were needed in the combustor design. The key result from both analyses and tests was that the combustor must be substantially lengthened to maximize combustion efficiency and sharply increase slag retention in the combustor. A measure of the success of these modifications was realized in the third phase of this project, consisting of task 5 entitled: 'Site Demonstration with the Second Generation 20 MMBtu/hr Air-Cooled Slagging Coal Tech Combustor'. The details of the task 5 effort are contained in Appendix 'C'. It was implemented between 1994 and 1998 after the entire 20 MMBtu/hr combustor-boiler facility was relocated to Philadelphia, PA in 1994. A new test facility was designed and installed. A substantially longer combustor was fabricated. Although not in the project plan or cost plan, an entire steam turbine-electric power generating plant was designed and the appropriate new and used equipment for continuous operation was specified. Insufficient funds and the lack of a customer for any electric power that the test facility could have generated prevented the installation of the power generating equipment needed for continuous operation. All other task 5 project measures were met and exceeded. 107 days of testing in task 5, which exceeded the 63 days (about 500 hours) in the test plan, were implemented. Compared to the first generation 20 MMBtu/hr combustor in Williamsport, the 2 nd generation combustor has a much higher combustion efficiency, the retention of slag inside the combustor doubled to about 75 % of the coal ash, and the ash carryover into the boiler, a major problem in the Williamsport combustor was essentially eliminated. In addition, the project goals for coal-fired emissions were exceeded in task 5. SO{sub 2 } was reduced by 80 % to 0. 2 lb/MMBtu in a combination of reagent injection in the combustion and post-combustion zones. NO{sub x} was reduced by 93 % to 0. 07 lb/MMBtu in a combination of staged combustion in the combustor and post-combustion reagent injection. A baghouse was installed that was rated to 0. 03 lb/MMBtu stack particle emissions. The initial <b>particle</b> <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> by EPA Method 5 indicated substantially higher emissions far beyond that indicated by the clear emission plume.

40|$|I {{summarize}} the {{recent advances in}} our understanding of the Soft Gamma Repeaters: in particular their spin behavior, persistent emission and hyper-Eddington outbursts. The giant flares on 5 March 1979 and 27 August 1998 provide compelling physical evidence for magnetic fields stronger than 10 B_QED = 4. 4 x 10 ^ 14 G, consistent with the rapid spindown detected in two of these sources. The persistent X-ray emission and variable spindown of the 6 - 12 s Anomalous X-ray Pulsars are compared and contrasted with those of the SGRs, and the case made for a close connection between the two types of sources. Their collective properties point to the existence of magnetars: neutron stars in which a decaying magnetic field (rather than accretion or rotation) is the dominant source of energy for radiative and <b>particle</b> <b>emissions.</b> Observational <b>tests</b> of the magnetar model are outlined, along with current ideas about the trigger of SGR outbursts, new evidence for the trapped fireball model, and the influence of QED processes on X-ray spectra and lightcurves.

40|$|<b>Emissions</b> of fine <b>particles</b> {{have been}} shown to have a large impact on the {{atmospheric}} environment and human health. Researchers have shown that gasoline engines, especially direct injection spark ignition (DISI) engines, tend to emit large amounts of small size particles compared to diesel engines fitted with diesel particulate filters (DPFs). As a result, the <b>particle</b> number <b>emissions</b> of DISI engines will be restricted by the forthcoming EU 6 legislation. The particulate emission level of DISI engines means that they could face some challenges in meeting the EU 6 requirement. This paper is an experimental study on the size-resolved <b>particle</b> number <b>emissions</b> from a spray guided DISI engine and the performance of a catalytic volatile particle remover (VPR), as the EU legislation seeks to exclude volatile particles. The performance of the catalytic VPR was evaluated by varying its temperature and the exhaust residence time.

40|$|The {{overwhelming}} use of nanoparticles {{in contemporary}} applications, {{as a result}} of possible opportunities for innovation, has brought huge potential risks to the workers and consumers due to their release/emission during their use. Therefore, it is necessary to study such an emission under different conditions of use so that the products are safe by design. The present study is focused on this aspect. Based on a multiaxial research approach, it has been found that the release of the aerosol particles, in general, {{is a direct result of}} the wear or fretting of surfaces due to various extrinsic and intrinsic surface properties which get affected during stress application conditions. In order to mimic these stress conditions, a linear abrasimeter (Taber 5750) is selected along with real time aerosol measuring devices (CPC, APS and SMPS), and a system for collecting the sampled particles for their further microscopic analysis. A range of materials treated with nanoparticles of titanium dioxide and silica, including both surface (nano-coatings) as well as bulk (nanoparticles reinforcement) treated, are tested in order to measure their <b>particles</b> <b>emission</b> tendency. The parameters studied include external load acting on the abrasion system, relative sliding speed, number of abrasion cycles and type of abrasives. The imperativeness of a proper nanosecurity during the tests is ensured by the conformity of a nanosecured post with an enclosing <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> chamber. The measurement of <b>particles</b> <b>emission</b> during the variation in abrasion parameters and the proper nanosecurity measures have allowed us to design and develop a versatile system which could quantify (semi-quantify to precise) as well as characterize the <b>particle</b> <b>emission</b> under diverse stress conditions. This study further benefits from a state of the art theoretical approach (under development) which emphasizes on the development of a scientific base explaining and justifying the reason behind the <b>particles</b> <b>emission.</b> The results show that during abrasion, considerable <b>emission</b> of wear <b>particles</b> occurs in the form of polydispersed aerosol.

With a high amount of long carbon chain lengths fatty acid methyl esters (C 20 to C 22), the microalgal biodiesel used had a vastly different average carbon chain length and level of unsaturation to conventional biodiesel, which significantly influenced <b>particle</b> <b>emissions.</b> Smaller blend percentages showed a larger reduction in <b>particle</b> <b>emission</b> than blend percentages of over 20 %. This was due to the formation of a significant nucleation mode for the higher blends.

This regulation forces the ship owners to make a fuel shift and use low-sulphur marine fuel oils, use alternative fuels or use scrubbers on-board their ships. One {{driving force behind the}} regulation of the fuel sulphur content was to reduce the emissions to air of harmful particles. This thesis focuses on the two first strategies and evaluate how fuel sulphur content and other fuel characteristics affect the <b>particle</b> <b>emissions.</b> This thesis presents results from particle measurements done in test-bed engine labs and on-board operating ships, with focus on number, mass and sizes of the emitted particles. The on-board measurements considered how a fuel shift from a heavy fuel oil to a low-sulphur residual marine fuel oil and how use of an alternative fuel, in this case liquefied natural gas (LNG) affect the <b>particle</b> <b>emissions.</b> In the test-bed engine measurements the <b>particle</b> <b>emissions</b> from different types of fuels and the effects of fuel sulphur content and other fuel characteristics, primarily the content of aromatics, were investigated. The results highlight that reduced fuel sulphur contents will not be the only solution for reducing <b>particle</b> <b>emissions,</b> and other fuel characteristics need to be considered. The fuel sulphur content influences the <b>emissions</b> of <b>particles</b> with a diameter of 50 nm or less, whereas other fuel characteristics affect particles in all sizes.
