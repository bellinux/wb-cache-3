50|$|Diacetyl arises {{naturally}} as {{a byproduct}} of fermentation. In some fermentative bacteria, it is formed via the thiamine pyrophosphate-mediated condensation of pyruvate and acetyl CoA. Sour (cultured) cream, cultured buttermilk, and cultured butter are produced by inoculating <b>pasteurized</b> <b>cream</b> or milk with a lactic starter culture, churning (agitating) and holding the milk until a desired pH drop (or increase in acidity) is attained. Cultured cream, cultured butter, and cultured buttermilk owe their tart flavour to lactic acid bacteria and their buttery aroma and taste to diacetyl.|$|E

40|$|The {{shelf life}} of ESL milks and <b>pasteurized</b> <b>creams</b> {{is limited by}} {{bacterial}} spoilage. The current state of knowledge {{with respect to the}} diversity and activities of the spoilage microflora in these products is still limited. To date, studies on this subject are yet to be carried out in Finland. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the spoilage microorganisms found in ESL milks and pasteurised creams mainly produced in Finland. 10 ESL milks and 8 pasteurised cream packages were obtained from the Finnish retail market and were stored at 8 ?C, 15 ?C, room temperature and 30 ?C, respectively, until expiration. Total bacterial counts were evaluated and 31 bacterial isolates were selected. An attempt was made to characterize the bacterial isolates using rpoB and 16 S rRNA partial gene sequence analyses. Psychrotrophic, spore-forming and spoilage features were also determined. Strain diversity was determined by rep-PCR profiling. Five selected isolates were subjected to metabolic profiling using the API 50 CHB test. When growth was detected, total bacterial counts ranged from 2. 67 to 3. 74 and 2. 54 to 8. 98 log units in cream and ESL milk samples, respectively. Both ESL milks and cream samples were dominated by heat-resistant, spore-forming species of the Bacillus genera: the isolates were related to B. licheniformis. B. weihenstephanensis, B. safensis, B. kochii, B. pumilus, B. subtilis and B. anthracis. Intraspecies and intrasample strain diversity was very high. Isolates mainly displayed proteolytic and lipolytic activity. Psychrotrophic activity was high in the cream samples while most ESL milk isolates were mostly mesophilic. Tested isolates were non-lactose fermenters and had varying metabolic profiles. The study revealed that Finnish ESL milks and <b>pasteurized</b> <b>creams</b> are prone to spoilage by species of the Bacillus genera that have potential for lipolytic and proteolytic spoilage and some of which are considered toxigenic. There is wide intraspecies strain diversity responsible for the wide variability in metabolic, psychrotrophic and spoilage features. Phenotypic tests based on API 50 CHB cannot be relied upon to make conclusions on taxonomy. Combining various methods is important for the comprehensive characterization of the bacterial isolates. Strategies to eliminate bacterial species of the Bacillus genera are important to prolong shelf life. However, intervention should be strain-specific to be effective. Large scale studies are required to confirm findings from this study...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study is to determine the prevalence rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in raw milk, <b>pasteurized</b> milk, ice <b>cream</b> and traditional butter in Sarab by culture and PCR techniques. To do so, 200 samples of raw milk, <b>pasteurized</b> milk, ice <b>cream</b> and traditional cheese were collected from different sellers across Sarab. They were first evaluated for contamination by coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus through culturing method and then, the isolates were subjected to PCR method according to nuc gene in order to confirm Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin resistance gene (mecA). The cultured samples indicated that 22 (44 %) of raw milk samples, 4 (8 %) of pasteurized milk samples, 9 (18 %) of traditional butter samples and 12 (24 %) of traditional cheese samples were contaminated by coagulase positive S. aureus. According to PCR using nuc gene primer, 18 (82 %) of raw milk isolates, 4 (100 %) of pasteurized milk isolates, 9 (75 %) of traditional cheese isolates and 7 (78 %) of traditional butter isolates contained nuc gene. According to PCR using MecA gene primer, 2 (50 %) of pasteurized milk isolates and 2 (22 %) of traditional cheese isolates contained MecA gene. No MecA gene was detected in raw milk and traditional butter isolates.

40|$|O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar os efeitos dos níveis de contagem de células somáticas (CCS) sobre as características físico-químicas e microbiológicas do leite semidesnatado e do creme de leite pasteurizados, ao longo de 28 e 30 dias de estocagem sob refrigeração. As frações protéicas do leite semidesnatado e o perfil de ácidos graxos do creme de leite pasteurizados foram pesquisados nos dias 1, 7, 14, 21 e 28 e 1, 10, 20 e 30 dias após a produção de cada produto. Foram definidos três grupos experimentais com baixa (750. 000 cél. mL- 1) CCS. O leite utilizado para compor cada grupo, em quatro repetições, foi coletado na granja leiteira da Fazenda da Aeronáutica, na cidade de Pirassununga-SP. O leite in natura de cada grupo foi submetido a desnate para obtenção do creme e do leite semidesnatado, tratados termicamente por pasteurização lenta e rápida, nesta sequência, seguido do envase asséptico em garrafas de polietileno de alta densidade (PEAD). No leite in natura, o percentual de gordura foi menor (P 0, 05), com exceção da β-caseína que apresentou maior concentração nos grupos de baixa e alta CCS (P 750. 000 cel. mL- 1) SCC. The {{milk used}} in each group, with four repetitions, was {{collected}} in the Air Force dairy farm in Pirassununga, São Paulo state, Brazil. The raw milk in each group was skimmed to obtain the cream, thermally treated by slow pasteurization, and the semi-skimmed milk (fast pasteurization), followed by aseptic bottling in high density polyethylene bottles. In the raw milk, significant differences were verified by the Tukey test (P< 0, 05) for the parameter fat {{in the level of}} low SCC in relation to the other groups. It was also observed for the raw milk a higher rate of proteins (3, 42 %) in the group of high SCC, while the low count group presented 2, 83 % protein. For the protein fractions in the pasteurized semi-skimmed milk, with an exception of the β-casein which presented statistical difference for the 5 % significance level between the low and high SCC groups, no other significant differences were observed. In the intermediate SCC group the pasteurized semi-skimmed milk presented 8, 98 mg. mL- 1 for α-casein, 10, 17 mg. mL- 1 for β-casein and 6, 14 mg. mL- 1 for κ-casein fractions. The αs 2 -casein was the protein fraction with the lowest proportions in this study, with 9, 89 % (low SCC), 10, 59 % (intermediate SCC) and 14, 97 % (high SCC) in relation to the casein total. There was predominance of palmitic acids (C 16 : 0), estearic (C 18 : 0), oleic (C 18 : 1) and miristic (C 14 : 0) in all somatic cell counts groups and the times used to evaluate the <b>pasteurized</b> milk <b>cream.</b> However, lower levels of oleic acid (C 18 : 1) were observed in creams with high and intermediate SCC, when compared with the lower SCC cream. The saturated acids presented variation of 53, 9 to 58, 1 % in relation to the unsaturated ones. The short chain acids were found in the <b>pasteurized</b> milk <b>cream</b> with about 8, 15 %, while the ones with medium and long chains were 47 % and 44 % respectively.

Angelica sinensis, Codonopsis pilosula, Illicium verum, Lycium barbarum, Momorsdica grosvenori and Psidium gujava water-extracts were co-incubated with <b>pasteurized</b> full <b>cream</b> milk containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus thermophilus and L. casei as starter culture. The addition of herbal water extracts stimulated Lactobacillus sp. growth in P. guajava–yoghurt (126. 3 ± 26. 3 × 106 CFUml- 1) only on day 0 and in L. barbarum–yoghurt from 0 to 3 days (109. 3 ± 21. 5 to 112. 7 ± 28. 8 × 106 CFUml- 1 respectively) of refrigerated storage. The growth of S. thermophilus were recorded higher than plain yoghurt for A. sinensis–yoghurt (53. 0 ± 9. 00 × 108 CFUml- 1), C. pilosula–yoghurt (37. 8 ± 22. 19 × 108 CFU ml- 1) and L. barbarum–yoghurts (day 0 and day 6; 97. 0 ± 19 × 108 CFUml- 1 and 42. 9 ± 4. 8 × 108 CFUml- 1 respectively). Total titratable acid (TTA) of A. sinensis–yoghurt (1. 02 ± 0. 01) was highest followed by M. grosvenori-, L. barbarum-, I. verum-, C. pilosula-, control- and P. guajava–yoghurts. All herbal-yoghurts had lower pH than plain-yoghurt during storage when they were incubated for 18 hours whereas P. guajava– and L. barbarum-yoghurts showed higher pH than control during storage for yoghurts when incubation was terminated at pH 4. 5. The presence of A. sinensis, I. verum and L. barbarum caused an increase in peptide concentration in yoghurts especially on day 7 (28. 6 ± 0. 4, 30. 58 ± 2. 2 and 32. 0 ± 2. 0 mg/ml respectively) vs. control (25. 42 ± 1. 1 mg/ml). A. sinensis also significantly enhanced the total free amino acids (0. 31 ± 0. 03 to 0. 43 ± 0. 12 mM) in water soluble nitrogen (WSN). IC 50 for evaluating anti- ACE activity of all yoghurts decreased with time to the minimum value by day 7 of storage followed by gradual increase in IC 50 values during the remaining period of storage. All herbal-yoghurts, except C. pilosula-yoghurt, showed lower IC 50 values than plain-yoghurt on day 21 of iii storage. Specific activity was also lower on day 7 for all treatments but P. guajava- and C. pilosula-yoghurts extract had less effect to reduce enzyme activity on day 0. Densitometric integrated intensity from SDS-PAGE pattern of yoghurt proteins degradation showed that the first week had the greatest α-casein and β-casein values followed by continuous declined in proteolysis as the storage time progressed. In conclusion adding selected medicinal herbs into yoghurt {{had the potential to}} enhance yoghurt fermentation, milk protein proteolysis and reduction in ACE- 1 activity in vitro.

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The free {{fatty acids}} of milk fat are {{believed}} to be involved in imparting flavor properties to milk and other dairy products. In the past the {{free fatty acids}} have largely been related to quality deterioration and hence the methods for measurement have been devised to determine the changes in the free fatty acid content and to relate these data with quality. No method has been reported to determine the quantities of individual free fatty acids. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate procedures and adapt methods for isolation and measurement of the free fatty acids of milk fat and then to evaluate adapted methods by quantitative measurement of the individual acids in fresh cream fat samples and in butter made therefrom. The ion exchange method of Hornstein et al. (50) was modified to isolate and esterify the free fatty acids from milk fat. The free fatty acids were adsorbed on Amberlite IRA- 400 resin, the resin was made fat free and the bound acids were simultaneously esterified and eluted with anhydrous methanol-HCl. The methyl esters were extracted from the reaction mixture with ethyl chloride (b. p. 12. 3 °C.). The ethyl chloride was evaporated and the esters weighed. The methyl esters were then separated by gas-liquid chromatography using the thermal conductivity detector. The recovery of each saturated even numbered fatty acid from 4 : 0 to 18 : 0 was checked. The percent recoveries obtained were: 4 : 0, 71. 4; 6 : 0, 86. 5; 8 : 0, 66. 6; 10 : 0, 75. 1; 12 : 0, 94. 3; 14 : 0, 100. 2; 16 : 0, 99. 5 and 18 : 0, 92. 5. The ion exchange resin was checked for its fat hydrolysing capacity, for retention of fatty acids when used in successive analyses and for leachings of brown polymers during each analysis. The resin did not show detectable hydrolysis of triglycerides nor did it retain or exchange fatty acids from previous use. It was necessary to pretreat the resin with stearic acid and anhydrous methanol-HCl to avoid interference of a leached polymer with quantitative results. An average of 5. 0 mg of residue leached from the resin during every analysis, but this did not interfere with the quantitative determination of free fatty acids. Twenty samples of milk fat; ten from <b>pasteurized</b> sweet <b>cream,</b> nine from cultured butter and one from sweet cream butter were analyzed for free fatty acids. The results obtained were compared with the esterified fatty acid content of milk fat. The percent composition of free fatty acids was {{similar to that of the}} esterified fatty acids in milk fat. Also the manufacturing process of butter had little or no effect upon the free fatty acid composition of the fat. The values obtained for volatile fatty acids, especially 4 : 0, were not consistent. One reason for this probably was that evaporation of the ethyl chloride from the solution of the methyl esters was carried out at room temperature and the evaporation rate was not controlled. It is believed that the results would be more consistent if the evaporation of ethyl chloride were carried out under controlled and standardized conditions and if internal standards are employed for quantitative references rather than weighing the ester mixture. Samples of autoxidized milk fat, sweet cream fat and rancid cream fat were analyzed for further evaluation of the method...|$|R
