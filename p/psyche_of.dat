25|$|Historical {{discussion}} {{revolves around}} whether the American battle plan made any operational or tactical sense.

25|$|Some {{aspects of}} American culture codify racism. For example, the {{prevailing}} idea in American culture, perpetuated by the media, {{has been that}} black features are less attractive or desirable than white features. The idea that blackness was ugly was highly damaging to the <b>psyche</b> <b>of</b> African Americans, manifesting itself as internalized racism. The Black is beautiful cultural movement sought to dispel this notion.|$|E
25|$|In the metanarrative of Zionism, {{according}} to Michelle Campos, the event became 'a central symbol of Jewish persecution {{at the hands}} of bloodthirsty Arabs' and was 'engraved in the national <b>psyche</b> <b>of</b> Israeli Jews', particularly those who settled in Hebron after 1967. Hillel Cohen regards the massacre as marking a point-of-no-return in Arab-Jewish relations, and forcing the Mizrahi Jews to join forces with Zionism.|$|E

25|$|Denouncing {{the concept}} of saviors, spiritual leaders, and any other {{intermediaries}} to reality, Krishnamurti {{stressed the need for}} a revolution in the <b>psyche</b> <b>of</b> every human being.

He urged people to directly discover the underlying causes of the problems facing individuals and society, and stated that such discovery is the natural outcome of absolute and unconditional psychological freedom, which he declared as being within everyone's reach.|$|E

[...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four.

500|$|While not {{a direct}} {{sequel to the}} events and {{characters}} of the first Silent Hill game, Silent Hill 2 {{takes place in the}} series' namesake town, located in the northeastern United States. Silent Hill 2 is set in another area of the town, and explores some of Silent Hill's backstory. The town draws upon the <b>psyche</b> <b>of</b> its visitors and ultimately forms alternative versions of the town, which differ depending on the character. The concept behind the town was [...] "a small, rural town in America"; to make the setting more realistic, some buildings and rooms lack furnishings.|$|E

[...] Embracing Holocaust denial, they claim that the Holocaust was a myth constructed by the Magian/Nazarene establishment in order to denigrate the Nazi administration following the Second World War and erase its achievements from [...] "the <b>psyche</b> <b>of</b> the West". The group believe that a Neo-Nazi revolution is necessary to overthrow the Magian-Nazarene domination of Western society and to establish the Imperium, ultimately allowing humanity to enter the Galactic civilization of the future.|$|E
500|$|Austen's plots {{highlight}} women's traditional {{dependence on}} marriage to secure social standing and economic security. As an art form, the 18th-century novel lacked {{the seriousness of}} its equivalents from the 19th century, when novels were treated as [...] "the natural vehicle for discussion and ventilation of what mattered in life". [...] Rather than delving too deeply into the <b>psyche</b> <b>of</b> her characters, Austen enjoys them and imbues them with humour, according to critic John Bayley. He believes that the well-spring of her wit and irony is her own attitude that comedy [...] "is the saving grace of life". Part of Austen's fame rests on the historical and literary significance {{that she was the}} first woman to write great comic novels. Samuel Johnson's influence is evident, in that she follows his advice to write [...] "a representation of life as may excite mirth".|$|E

500|$|All {{the costumes}} {{in the film}} were {{designed}} by Mona May, who had previously worked on Clueless, The Wedding Singer, and The Haunted Mansion. To create the costumes, May spent one year in pre-production working with animators and her costume department of 20 people, while she contracted with five outside costume shops in Los Angeles and New York City. She {{became involved in the}} project during the time when the animators are designing the faces and bodies of the characters as they had to [...] "translate the costumes from two-dimensional drawings to live-action human proportion". Her goal was to keep the designs [...] "Disneyesque to the core but bring a little bit of fashion in there and humor and make it something new". However, May admitted this was difficult [...] "because they're dealing with iconic Disney characters {{who have been in the}} <b>psyche</b> <b>of</b> the viewing audience for so long".|$|E

She {{played the role}} of a disturbed teenager and called it an [...] "exhausting" [...] experience, saying that she felt drained while trying to, [...] "get into a <b>psyche</b> <b>of</b> someone who does a lot of drugs and booze, has lost her mind a little bit and is very vulnerable". While the character was inconsistently described by film critics as [...] "a nightmare" [...] and [...] "engaging", Koechlin was unanimously praised for her performance, with Raja Sen calling her [...] "an increasingly striking actress". Upon release the film received positive reviews from critics, and Koechlin was nominated for the Best Actress Award at the Star Screen Awards.|$|E
5000|$|The book became Talese's first bestseller. But the inner-workings of an American {{newsroom}} {{was seen}} as an odd choice for a book.

These seemingly ordinary drapes set off a melodrama with an equal amount of love and lunacy.|$|R
