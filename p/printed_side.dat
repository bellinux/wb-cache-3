2500|$|A {{question}} {{that can only}} be answered by conjecture is that of the relation between the Roman Canon and any of the other ancient liturgical anaphoras. There are undoubtedly very striking parallels between it and both of the original Eastern rites, those of Alexandria and Antioch. Mgr. Duchesne is inclined to connect the Roman use with that of Alexandria, and the other great Western liturgy, the Gallican Rite, with that of Antioch (Origines, 54). But the Roman Canon shows perhaps more likeness to that of Antioch in its formulæ. These parallel passages have been collected and <b>printed</b> <b>side</b> by side by Dr. Drews in his [...] "Entstehungsgeschichte des Kanons in der römischen Messe", in order to prove a thesis which will be referred to later. Meanwhile, whatever may be thought of Drew's theory, the likeness of the prayers cannot be denied. For instance, the Intercession in the Syrian Liturgy of St. James begins with the prayer (Brightman, East. Lit., 89-90): ...|$|E

5000|$|Usually a {{flat bed}} sheet is {{overlocked}} {{around the edges}} to form four seams. One of the seams is wider than the other three and helps with orienting the sheet correctly on the mattress. The wider seam goes at the head end of the mattress. Sometimes the sides do not have seams, but are finished with the selvedge only. When placing a flat sheet on a bed, the manufacturer has designed the <b>printed</b> <b>side</b> to be softer, and thus it {{should be placed on}} the bed <b>printed</b> <b>side</b> [...] "down". When folding back the covers, this also allows the <b>printed</b> <b>side</b> to show, for aesthetic purposes. When one makes a bed, the patterned or monogrammed side of the top sheet is placed facing down and then the top edge is folded towards the foot of the bed, exposing the design.|$|E

50|$|The Didascalia Apostolorum, whose lost {{original}} was in Greek, {{was first}} published in 1854 in Syriac by Paul de Lagarde. In 1900 Edmund Hauler published the Verona Palimpsest which includes a Latin translation of the Didascalia, perhaps of the fourth century, more than half of which has perished. In 1906 Franz Xaver von Funk published the texts, <b>printed</b> <b>side</b> by side, of both the Didascalia and the Apostolic Constitutions, in order to show the similarities.

5000|$|Sometimes {{the model}} pieces can be punched out. More {{frequently}} the printed parts must be cut out. Edges may be scored to aid folding. The parts are usually glued together with polyvinyl acetate glue ("white glue", [...] "PVA"). In {{this kind of}} modeling the sections are usually pre-painted, {{so there is no}} need to paint the model after completion. Some enthusiasts may enhance the model by painting and detailing. Due to the nature of the paper medium, the model may be sealed with varnish or filled with spray foam to last longer. Some enthusiasts also use paper crafts or perdurable to do life-sized props starting by making the craft, covering it with resin and painting them. Some also use photo paper and laminate them by heat, thus preventing the <b>printed</b> <b>side</b> from color wearing-out, beyond improved realistic effect on certain kinds of models (ships, cars, buses, trains, etc.). Paper crafts can be used as references to do props with other materials too.|$|E
5000|$|The Premio Quinto Sol {{was created}} in 1970, {{publishing}} the work of Chicano and Chicana authors from 1971 to 1975. This was the first literary prize promoted nationally. Awarded to the best fictional work by Mexican American authors it was a means of recognizing and promoting Chicano writers. The award involved a cash prize of $1000 and publication of the winning manuscript. The first Premio Quinto Sol was awarded to Tomás Rivera, an Associate Professor of Spanish at Sam Houston University in Huntsville, Texas, in 1971 for ...y no se lo tragó la tierra (And the Earth Did Not Devour Him).

40|$|Abstract—Most halftoning {{techniques}} allow screen dots to overlap. They rely on {{the assumption}} that the inks are transparent, i. e. the inks do not scatter a significant portion of the light back to the air. However, many special effect inks such as metallic inks, iridescent inks or pigmented inks are not transparent. In order to create halftone images, halftone dots formed by such inks should be juxtaposed, i. e. <b>printed</b> <b>side</b> by side. We propose an efficient juxtaposed color halftoning technique for placing any desired number of colorant layers side by side without overlapping. The method uses a monochrome library of screen elements made of discrete lines having rational thicknesses. Discrete line juxtaposed color halftoning is performed efficiently by multiple accesses to the screen element library. Index Terms—Color halftoning, discrete lines, juxtapose...|$|E
