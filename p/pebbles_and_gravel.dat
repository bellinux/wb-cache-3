60|$|Pyncheon Street, {{in front}} of the House of the Seven Gables, was a far pleasanter scene than a by-lane, {{confined}} by shabby fences, and bordered with wooden dwellings of the meaner class, could reasonably be expected to present.

60|$|It is {{difficult}} to find anything like parallel cases in inorganic nature, but that of a river may perhaps illustrate the subject in some degree. Let us suppose a person totally ignorant of Modern Geology to study carefully a great River System. He finds in its lower part, a deep broad channel filled to the brim, flowing slowly through a flat country and carrying out to the sea a quantity of fine sediment. Higher up it branches into a number of smaller channels, flowing alternately through flat valleys and between high banks; sometimes he finds a deep rocky bed with perpendicular walls, carrying the water through a chain of hills; where the stream is narrow he finds it deep, where wide shallow. Further up still, he comes to a mountainous region, with hundreds of streams and rivulets, each with its tributary rills and gullies, collecting the water from every square mile of surface, and every channel adapted to the water that it has to carry. He finds that the bed of every branch, and stream, and rivulet, has a steeper and steeper slope as it approaches its sources, and is thus enabled to carry off the water from heavy rains, and to bear away the stones and <b>pebbles</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel,</b> that would otherwise block up its course. In every part of this system he would see exact adaptation of means to an end. He would say, that this system of channels must have been designed, it answers its purpose so effectually. Nothing but a mind could have so exactly adapted the slopes of the channels, their capacity, and frequency, {{to the nature of the}} soil and the quantity of the rainfall. Again, he would see special adaptation to the wants of man, in broad quiet navigable rivers flowing through fertile plains that support a large population, while the rocky streams and mountain torrents, were confined to those sterile regions suitable only for a small population of shepherds and herdsmen. He would listen with incredulity to the Geologist, who assured him, that the adaptation and adjustment he so admired was an inevitable result of the action of general laws. That the rains and rivers, aided by subterranean forces, had modelled the country, had formed the hills and valleys, had scooped out the river beds, and levelled the plains;--and it would only be after much patient observation and study, after having watched the minute changes produced year by year, and multiplying them by thousands and ten thousands, after visiting the various regions of the earth and seeing the changes everywhere going on, and the unmistakable signs of greater changes in past times,--that he could be made to understand that the surface of the earth, however beautiful and harmonious it may appear, is strictly due in every detail to the action of forces which are demonstrably self-adjusting.|$|E

40|$|The photointerpretation, using aerial {{photographs}} recorded {{from the}} Armero's Debris Flow, {{few days after}} it took place, in agreement with survivors reports, indicate that the event occurred in three principal pulses, each one with different hydrodynamic characteristics, as has been observed in other places of the world. In the first place there was a preceding muddy flow that only affected the shallower places such as the closer ones to the Lagunilla River; the first pulse was an extremely dense flow supersatured with solids with a variable and relatively low velocity {{that resulted in a}} continous debris sheet that covered the flat lands with a thickness of up to 3 meters height and a radius of 2. 5 km. The push and advance of this flow which included the biggest blocks was the responsible of the destruction of Armero. The effect of this flow was differential, as in higher zones the debris flow did not demolish houses and was inyected though doors and windows. The high density of this flow {{was one of the main}} reasons that it did not affect some streets with high slopes.   The second pulse consisted of high velocity turbulent running water, loaded with <b>pebbles</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravels,</b> which generated a high erosion capacity that stripped off the former fan, providing a terrace aspect and producing new distributary water channels. The third pulse was a low level water flow with a high concentration of <b>gravel,</b> sand <b>and</b> mud, which took place for several hours.

The illite clay in fault zones was possibly derived from the underlying Pinal Schist.

The blocky clay unit is autochthonous sediment that was at least partially derived from residual fault gouge clay at the time of cave dissolution.

50|$|Another serious {{obstacle}} {{encountered in}} river engineering consists {{in the large}} quantity of detritus they bring down in flood-time, derived mainly from {{the disintegration of the}} surface layers of the hills and slopes in the upper parts of the valleys by glaciers, frost and rain. The power of a current to transport materials varies with its velocity, so that torrents with a rapid fall near the sources of rivers can carry down rocks, boulders and large stones, which are by degrees ground by attrition in their onward course into slate, gravel, sand and silt, simultaneously with the gradual reduction in fall, and, consequently, in the transporting force of the current. Accordingly, under ordinary conditions, most of the materials brought down from the high lands by torrential water courses are carried forward by the main river to the sea, or partially strewn over flat alluvial plains during floods; the size of the materials forming the bed of the river or borne along by the stream is gradually reduced on proceeding seawards, so that in the Po River in Italy, for instance, <b>pebbles</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> are found for about 140 miles below Turin, sand along the next 100 miles, and silt and mud in the last 110 miles (176 km).|$|E

They had a total discharge of about 0. 1 m 3 /sec and were found in meta-morphic carbonate rocks on bare ground under {{the eastern part of}} Torellbreen.

40|$|Conservation of phenotypically {{variable}} taxa {{such as the}} European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) can {{be particularly}} challenging. In this thesis {{it is argued that}} the recent designation of seven native C. lavaretus populations as three endemic species (C. clupeoides, C. stigmaticus and C. pennantii) by Kottelat & Freyhof (2007) are incorrect and cannot be substantiated with the results presented here. However, evidence for important infra-specific variation between populations has been found. Two native Scottish populations of C. lavaretus show considerable variation in morphology, trophic ecology and life history. The variation in these populations warrants protection, one conservation action becoming more commonly utilised in Britain is conservation translocation. It was found that there were significant differences between source and refuge populations in Scotland. The wisdom of using this conservation measure on a phenotypically plastic organism is discussed. Nevertheless the establishment of further refuge populations are considered to be a viable conservation action. Sub-structuring within the largest native Scottish population of C. lavaretus was not found. However, evidence of residence within certain basins of Loch Lomond was found through significant differences in muscle stable isotope signatures. Investigation was also made into the trophic ecology of other fish in Loch Lomond. It was found that brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Loch Lomond have a non-typical migration pattern and invasive ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) now form {{an important part of the}} trophic ecology of this site. In Britain several whitefish populations have been invaded by ruffe, a species native to Britain, but not to these sites.

This member has highly porosity respect to first member and less grade of erodibility. The third horizon (Kahrizak Formation) with 10 to 60 m of thickness contains <b>pebble,</b> <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> sand. It is Middle Pleistocene in age. The fourth stage (Tehran alluvium) with 50 m of thickness has been formed by stratified gravels of Upper Pleistocene age. In general this Formation is composed of heterogeneous grains and because of having frail cement between pebbles it is permeable and with relatively high mechanical resistance. Tehran alluvium has been the better depository of underground water in the alluvial fan of Tehran region. The fifth part (Holocene stage) with 1 - 5 m of thickness contains coating <b>pebbles,</b> <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> fine sediments. It is composed of separated and highly permeable deposits, which its mechanical resistance differs in {{different part of the}} region. The thickness of alluvial aquifer is estimated about 300 - 350 m, which composed of second member of Hezardareh and younger Formation. Much of the groundwater essential to agriculture and human existence emanetes from aquifers in Quaternary sediments of Tehran plain. According to our surveys and data, annually water consumption of Tehran city is about 700 million meter cubic which 20. 8 % of it discharges from Quaternary deposited sediments...|$|R
50|$|Lithostratigraphically, the Hagerman Horse Quarry {{is located}} within the upper member of the Glenns Ferry Formation and lies 9.5 meters below the contact with the {{overlying}} Tuana Gravel. The Plio-Pleistocene Tuana Gravel unconformably overlies the Glenns Ferry Formation and {{is described as a}} series of cyclic beds of silt, <b>pebble</b> sands <b>and</b> cobble <b>gravel.</b> Sedimentological data of the Tuana Gravel indicates the gravel beds were deposited on a northwest sloping alluvial plain. Thickness of the gravel beds varies, but is about 50 feet in Fossil Gulch area. The Tuana Gravel is overlain by a caliche, thought to have formed during a Pleistocene interglacial period, and several feet of recent soils (Richmond and others 2002).|$|R
50|$|The Mogoltau Massif is an {{isolated}} massif some 40 km long and 15-25 km wide, with {{an area of}} 350 km2, reaching an altitude of about 1600 m above sea level. The central high point is Muzbek peak with a height of 1624 m. The massif comprises a broad plateau of rubble, boulders, <b>pebbles,</b> <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> loess-like loam. It is incised by mainly dry riverbeds formed by ephemeral streams which flow during the spring rains. The area contains several small settlements and is surrounded, by cultivated land. As an ecological island it has a distinct avifauna which {{is different from the}} nearby Turkestan and Kuraminskiy Ranges.|$|R
