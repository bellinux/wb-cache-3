30|$|A digital poster is an {{interactive}} multimodal version of regular papers. The advantage of digital posters includes retrieval and reuse of contents.

Interaction histories when visitors have interacted with the posters are recorded automatically.

Moreover, given an intelligent system that recognizes the users by robust face detection algorithm, user interaction will be smooth, and annotations will be automated and personalized, thereby creating a more advanced learning environment. An automated evaluation and facilitation of intellectual activities will also be applied to confirm whether the skills of the students improve, and whether their created contents obtain a higher evaluation than previous ones.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION The use of Web {{technology}} for communicating healthcare-related information has grown {{dramatically in the}} past several years. The 1997 AMIA Fall Symposium included over 120 papers, <b>posters,</b> and <b>panels</b> that included or discussed a Web interface in a clinical application. Though early prototype developments focused primarily on the use of Web clients on private networks 1 - 5 (i. e., intranets), the use of the public Internet as a communications infrastructure for patient-identifiable data is growing. This growth has been propelled by the recent introduction of security technologies for Web communications such as the Secure Sockets Layer 7 (SSL) and the Secure Electronic Transactions (SET) protocol. 8 These technologies contribute to the protection of data communications between server and client, but do not address vulnerabilities in the client and server environments.

40|$|Researchers often {{summarize}} {{their work}} {{in the form of}} posters. Posters provide a coherent and efficient way to convey core ideas from scientific papers. Generating a good scientific poster, however, is a complex and time consuming cognitive task, since such posters need to be readable, informative, and visually aesthetic. In this paper, for the first time, we study the challenging problem of learning to generate posters from scientific papers. To this end, a data-driven framework, that utilizes graphical models, is proposed. Specifically, given content to display, the key elements of a good <b>poster,</b> including <b>panel</b> layout and attributes of each panel, are learned and inferred from data. Then, given inferred layout and attributes, composition of graphical elements within each panel is synthesized. To learn and validate our model, we collect and make public a Poster-Paper dataset, which consists of scientific papers and corresponding posters with exhaustively labelled panels and attributes. Qualitative and quantitative results indicate the effectiveness of our approach. Comment: in Proceedings of the 30 th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI' 16), Phoenix, AZ, 201...|$|R

40|$|As of 2016, {{diabetes}} affects {{more than}} 29 {{million people in}} the United States and is the 7 th leading cause of death nationwide. In Vermont, 1 / 10 people are diagnosed with either diabetes or prediabetes, with 6 % of Vermonters affected by prediabetes and 5 % of Chittenden Country affected by prediabetes. The public health burden of this chronic disease is immense: diabetes costs Vermont an estimated $ 543 million each year and {{is the leading cause of}} kidney failure, lower limb amputations, and adult-onset blindness. Prediabetes occurs when blood sugar is higher than normal but not at the diagnostic threshold of diabetes. Prediabetes does not definitely progress to type 2 diabetes if interventions are made, including healthier eating and physical activity to promote modest weight loss. The CDC has developed evidence-based curricula for lifestyle intervention in prediabetics with intensive individual counseling and motivational support on effective diet, exercise, and behavior modification. One of these curricula is currently run through the CDC-led National YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program (YDPP). Participation in this program reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58 % across all ethnic groups and sexes overall and by 71 % in individuals over age 60. The Vermont YDPP had 325 participants in 2016, with only 21 % (n= 70) of those referrals to the program coming from healthcare providers. Healthcare providers have a unique role in the community of being the voices of health promotion. With the correct provider awareness of the YDPP and patient identification, awareness, and education, an increase in the percentage of YDPP-referring healthcare providers can increase the overall YDPP participation in Chittenden county. As of 2016, 60, 038 people in Chittenden county have prediabetes, but only 8, 026 are diagnosed, and an additional 52, 012 people could be diagnosed with prediabetes by their healthcare professional and referred to the YDPP. This campaign intends to serve as a pilot project to create provider and patient awareness of the YDPP, identify patients with prediabetes, and ensure providers screen and refer prediabetic patients to the YDPP. Through exam room <b>posters,</b> <b>panel</b> query management, electronic medical record reprogramming, and targeted patient intervention, this study aims to increase YDPP patient participation via healthcare provider referral and refine the model for adaptation and implementation in other healthcare centers throughout Chittenden County.
