5|$|Examples of glycerophospholipids {{found in}} {{biological}} membranes are <b>phosphatidylcholine</b> (also known as PC, GPCho or lecithin), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE or GPEtn) and phosphatidylserine (PS or GPSer). In addition to {{serving as a}} primary component of cellular membranes and binding sites for intra- and intercellular proteins, some glycerophospholipids in eukaryotic cells, such as phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidic acids are either precursors of or, themselves, membrane-derived second messengers. Typically, {{one or both of}} these hydroxyl groups are acylated with long-chain fatty acids, but there are also alkyl-linked and 1Z-alkenyl-linked (plasmalogen) glycerophospholipids, as well as dialkylether variants in archaebacteria.|$|E
5|$|MFGM {{phospholipid}} components such as <b>phosphatidylcholine</b> {{are a key}} constituent of {{the intestinal}} mucus barrier, and therefore may contribute to intestinal defense against invasive pathogens.

Of the phospholipids, the most common headgroup is <b>phosphatidylcholine</b> (PC), accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells. PC is a zwitterionic headgroup, as it has a negative charge on the phosphate group and a positive charge on the amine but, because these local charges balance, no net charge.|$|E

40|$|Refeeding a high-sucrose, {{fat-free}} diet to fasted rats caused drastic {{alterations in}} the fatty acid composition of hepatic diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols, and <b>phosphatidylcholines.</b> However, the fatty acid profile of phosphatidylethanolamines {{did not change}} significantly. These {{results suggest that the}} fatty acid composition of diacylglycerols may influence the distribution of diacylglycerols among triacylglycerols, <b>phosphatidylcholines,</b> and phosphatidylethanolamines. Fasting and refeeding also affected the activities in vitro of a number of enzymes responsible for the formation of triacylglycerols, <b>phosphatidylcholines,</b> and phosphatidylethanolamines. The activity of hepatic phosphatidate phosphatase increased fourfold upon refeeding. However, fasting the rats did not affect the activity of this enzyme despite the reduced triacylglycerol synthesis in the fasted liver in vivo. Fasting and refeeding induced alterations in the activities of diacylglycerol acyltransferase, cholinephosphotransferase, and ethanolaminephosphotransferase which correlated reasonably well with the changes observed in the synthesis of triacylglycerols, <b>phosphatidylcholines,</b> and phosphatidylethanolamines in vivo, although the changes in diacylglycerol acyltransferase were too moderate. The changes in the activity of cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase, which is suggested to catalyze the rate-limiting step in the formation of CDP-choline, ran parallel with the alterations in the synthesis of <b>phosphatidylcholines</b> in vivo. No such correlation was found between the activity of ethanolaminephosphate cytidylyltransferase and the rate of phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis. The present results indicate that the synthesis of triacylglycerols, <b>phosphatidylcholines,</b> and phosphatidylethanolamines is controlled by the availability of the various substrates {{as well as by the}} activities of several enzymes involved in these processes...|$|R

5|$|In many {{naturally}} occurring bilayers, the compositions {{of the inner}} and outer membrane leaflets are different. In human red blood cells, the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet is composed mostly of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated derivatives. By contrast, the outer (extracellular) leaflet is based on <b>phosphatidylcholine,</b> sphingomyelin and a variety of glycolipids, In some cases, this asymmetry is based on where the lipids are made in the cell and reflects their initial orientation. The biological functions of lipid asymmetry are imperfectly understood, although it is clear that it is used in several different situations. For example, when a cell undergoes apoptosis, the phosphatidylserine— normally localised to the cytoplasmic leaflet— is transferred to the outer surface: There, it is recognised by a macrophage that then actively scavenges the dying cell.|$|E
5|$|The lipid {{component}} of MFGM {{is rich in}} phospholipids, glycosphingolipids, and cholesterol. Phospholipids make up approximately 30% of the total lipid weight of MFGM, the three most prominent being sphingomyelin (SM), <b>phosphatidylcholine</b> (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which together represent up to 85% of total phospholipids. Phospholipids and sphingolipids play central roles in cerebral neurogenesis and migration during fetal development, as well as promoting neuronal growth, differentiation, and synaptogenesis {{during the first year}} of life. Other important polar lipids present in the membrane include the glycerophospholipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), as well as gangliosides (GG), which are sphingolipids containing sialic acid and an oligosaccharide side chain.

40|$|The thermotropic phase {{behavior}} of {{four members of}} the homologous series of dl-methyl anteisobranched <b>phosphatidylcholines</b> was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The odd-numbered <b>phosphatidylcholines</b> exhibit spectral changes in two distinct temperature ranges, while their even-numbered counterparts exhibit spectral changes within only a single temperature range. The hightemperature transition observed in the odd-numbered <b>phosphatidylcholines</b> and the single thermotropic event characteristic of the phase {{behavior of}} their even-numbered counterparts are both identified as gel/liquid-crystalline phase transitions. The low-temperature event exhibited only by the odd-numbered phospholipids is identified as a gel/gel phase transition that involves changes in the packing mode of the acyl chain methylene groups, as well as changes in the conformation of the glycerol ester interface. These infrared spectroscopic data thus suggest that at low temperatures the odd-numbered methyl anteisobranched <b>phosphatidylcholines</b> form a highly ordered condensed phase similar to the Lc phases of the linear saturated n-acylphosphatidylcholines. A comparable condensed phase was not formed by the even-numbered anteisobranched <b>phosphatidylcholines</b> under similar conditions.

The amount of hexagonally organized lipid increases with increasing fatty acid chain length. With <b>phosphatidylcholines</b> possessing shorter fatty acid chains, {{as well as with the}} longer <b>phosphatidylcholines</b> in the gel state, a lamellar organization results. Of the various possible models to explain the induction of the hexagonal HII phase by gramicidin, one in which gramicidin dimers span adjacent cylinders of the hexagonal HII phase seems most plausible. In <b>phosphatidylcholines</b> with intermediary chain lengths gramicidin induces intermediary structures, such as lipidic particles and possibly cubic phases.

Such a preferable stimulation of arylesterase activity was more remarkable with <b>phosphatidylcholines</b> with polyunsaturated acyl chains or oxidized chains at sn- 2 position, implying that the packing degree of acyl chain may be also important for the preferable stimulation of arylesterase activity. Separately, 1 -palmitoyl-lysoPC also stimulated arylesterase activity preferably, indicating that the micellar formation of lipids around PON 1 also contributes to the stimulatory action. Additionally, phosphatidylglycerols slightly enhanced arylesterase activity, but not paraoxonase activity. In contrast, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid (≥ 0. 1  mM) inhibited both activities Further, such a preferable stimulation of arylesterase activity by <b>phosphatidylcholines</b> was also reproduced with VLDL-bound PON 1, although to a less extent. These data indicate that <b>phosphatidylcholines</b> with polyunsaturated acyl chains or oxidized chain, or lysophosphatidylcholine cause a preferable stimulation of arylesterase activity, thereby contributing to the decrease in the ratio of paraoxonase activity to arylesterase activity...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the chain-length dependence of the chain-melting transition temperatures of bilayers composed of lipids with identical chains (Marsh, D. 1991. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1062 : 1 – 6) is extended to include lipids with chains of unequal length. The bilayer transition temperatures of saturated asymmetrical <b>phosphatidylcholines</b> are interpreted by assuming that the transition enthalpy and transition entropy are linearly related to the absolute value {{of the difference in}} chain length between the sn- 1 and sn- 2 chains, with constant end contributions. Such an assumption is supported by calorimetric data on <b>phosphatidylcholines</b> of constant mean chainlength and varying chain asymmetry. In particular, a symmetrical linear dependence is observed on the chain asymmetry, Δn, which is centered around a value Δn° that corresponds to the conformational inequivalence of the sn- 1 and sn- 2 chains. The transition temperature then takes the form: Tt = Tt∞(n - nH - h′ | Δn + Δn° |) /(n - ns - s′ | Δn + Δn°) where nH, ns are the end contributions, and h′, s′ are fractional deficits in the incremental transition enthalpy and entropy, respectively, arising from the overlapping regions of the longer chains. Optimization on the transition temperature data for the dependence on chain asymmetry of three series of <b>phosphatidylcholines</b> with constant mean chainlength, n, yields parameters that are capable of predicting the dependence of the transition temperatures on chain asymmetry for other mean chainlengths. The dependence of the transition temperature on mean chainlength for <b>phosphatidylcholines</b> in which the chain asymmetry is maintained constant, as well as the dependence on both mean chain length and chain asymmetry for <b>phosphatidylcholines</b> in which one of the two chains is maintained of constant length, are also described with high accuracy by using the same parameters...|$|R
