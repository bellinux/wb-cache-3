The pneumatic servo-controlled loading system is capable of operating {{in a range of}} extreme conditions such as high temperature, pressurised water or steam, Super Critical Water (SCW) and irradiation environments. The main benefit of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>loading</b> system {{is that there is no}} moving parts (loading lead-throughs) required for loading a specimen inside a pressure vessel or otherwise demanding containment (water, gas, radioactive), only pressure lines and electrical feedback connections together with the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>loading</b> unit, bellows are required. Also, the pneumatically powered testing device itself can be far away from the control units and regulating servo valves. The HIPS, previously used for tensile testing, stress corrosion cracking, fatigue, in-pile creep fatigue (copper), and other test variants with combined environmental impact, has now been modified to perform load and strain controlled testing at temperatures in the creep range for steels. For the high temperature applications where creep is an active damage mechanism, the HIPS technology opens new applications for creep and fatigue related testing types such as standard creep-fatigue (with and without hold time), relaxation and slow strain rate tensile testing. The main focus of this paper is to present the current status of the development work of the HIPS technology for high temperature applications, presently conducted in air atmosphere.

According to studies, {{the time it takes to}} drill, clean and blast an end in conventional decline development can be up to 224 minutes.

The purpose of the current {{study was to determine the}} effect of the ratio between pneumatic and isoinertial resistance on the force–velocity relationship during ballistic movements. Methods: A total of 15 participants performed 2 concentric repetitions of ballistic bench-press movements with intention to throw the bar at 30 %, 45 %, 60 %, 75 %, and 90 % of the maximal concentric repetition with 5 resistance ratios including 100 %, 75 %, 50 %, 25 %, or 0 % of pneumatic resistance, the additional load being isoinertial. Force-, velocity-, and power-time patterns were assessed and averaged over the concentric phase to determine the force–velocity and power–velocity relationships for each resistance ratio. Results: Each 25 % increase in the pneumatic part in the resistance ratio elicited higher movement velocity (+ 0. 11 ± 0. 03 m/s from 0 % to 80 % of the concentric phase) associated with lower force levels (– 43. 6 ± 15. 2 N). Increased isoinertial part in the resistance ratio resulted in higher velocity toward the end of the movement (+ 0. 23 ± 0. 01 m/s from 90 % to 100 %). Conclusions: The findings show that the resistance ratio could be modulated to develop the acceleration phase and force toward the end of the concentric phase (pneumatic-oriented resistance). Inversely, isoinertial-oriented resistance should be used to develop maximal force and maximal power. Resistance modality could, therefore, be considered an innovative variable to modulate the training stimulus according to athletic purposes...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an in depth {{investigation of the}} following four resistance modes: constant resistance (CR), rubber based resistance (RBR), pneumatic resistance (PnR) and standard link steel chain (SLSC) resistance; where the following issues were assessed: i) a review of literature discussing the kinematics, kinetics, practical applications and limitations of constant, accommodating and vaiiable resistance modes; ii) a descriptive analysis of the resistive properties of RBR, SLSC and PnR; and iii) an experimental study researching the kinematic and kinetic effects of performing squat and jump type movements with CR, PnR, RBR and SLSC. The review provides valuable biomechanical information with regards to human strength curves (def. which approximate the torque production capabilities of single and multi-joint movements), cam and lever systems, RBR and SLSC resistance. The descriptive analysis of RBR, SLSC and PnR provides the strength and conditioning coach and clinician with a methodology to quantify variable resistance, which {{may be useful in}} the presc 1 iption of specific loading intensities. The RBR bands exhibited curvilinear tension-defonnation relationships and were best represented by quadratic function equations (R 2 2 : 0. 99); while the SLS chains exhibited linear mass-displacement relationships and were best represented by linear function equations (R 2 = 1). When purchasing bands the buyer needs to be aware of inter-band resting length differences (0. 5 to 5. 3 %), as this results in mean tension imbalances (1. 6 to 17. 5 %) in the same colour band. The development of adjustment equations were required for the PnR system to correct for the inaccuracies of the displayed values. The displayed and measured (i. e. force plate) loads increased in a linear fashion allowing the regression equations to accurately predict (r 2 = 1) true loads from displayed load values. The mean displayed load was 28 % greater than the mean measured load, which would pose a major problem for prescribing specific <b>pneumatic</b> <b>loads</b> if adjustment equations were unavailable. All pneumatic resistive devices should be tested by the manufacturer, practitioner and scientist in a similar manner if utilized in institutes of sport and research, as well as fitness centres. The experimental study was undertaken to determine the mechanical effects of CR, RBR, SLSC and PnR on peak velocity (PV), mean force (MF), peak force (PF), work, mean power (MP), peak power (PP), rate of force development (RFD) and rate of power development (RPD) while performing h·aditional squats (TS), shallow counte 1 movement jumps (SCMJ) and deep countennovement jumps (DCMJ).

The significant differences found between the resistance modes suggest that strength and conditioning professionals should use RBR bands and PnR in training programs to increase speed and power in their athletes; and utilize CR and PnR to maximize force and power development.

There is some training interest by combining isoinertial and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>loading.</b> The aim of this study was to determine how different isoinertial-pneumatic ratio influence the force-velocity-power relationships during bench-press. Methods: Fifteen participants performed bench press at 30 %, 45 %, 60 %, 75 %, and 90 % of their 1 RM, with five isoinertial(I) -pneumatic(P) resistance ratio : 100 %I/ 0 %P, 75 %I/ 25 %P, 50 %I/ 50 %P, 25 %I/ 75 %P, and 0 %I/ 100 %P. Velocity, force and power were assessed using a linear transducer and mechanical parameters measured by the pneumatic ergometer. Force-, velocity- and power-time patterns were averaged over the push-off phase to build the corresponding force-velocity and power-velocity relationships for each resistance ratio. Results: The increase in pneumatic part in resistance ratio elicited higher movement velocity and lower force level from 0 % to 80 % of the concentric phase. The increase in isoinertial part in resistance balance resulted in higher velocity {{towards the end of the}} movement. As a consequence, the use of isoinertial resistance oriented the force-velocity relationship towards force, whereas pneumatic resistance elicited a more velocity-oriented profile. Conclusion: Pneumatic-oriented resistance could be used to develop initial velocity and force towards the end of the push-off. Isoinertial-oriented resistance should be used to develop maximal force and maximal power. Resistance modality could be modulated according to training objectives. Références : 1. Frost et al.

40|$|Special {{requirements}} {{set for the}} constructional {{materials used}} in energy production have strongly influenced the challenges in the component design work. Many material parameters such as corrosion, fracture mechanics, fatigue and oxide films are needed as input data for such work. The generation of reliable data calls also for more sophisticated testing systems. The newly developed <b>pneumatic</b> <b>loading</b> technology (patented in Finland and international patents pending) provides important potential benefits and has already been successfully applied to testing many kinds of materials in different test environments. As the moving parts that penetrate the pressure boundary are not needed, the friction force at the sealing element location is avoided. Therefore the load control with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>loading</b> unit is more accurate than with the conventional servo-hydraulic devices. This enables testing of small size samples which is an advantage e. g. when testing irradiated materials or testing materials inside the reactor core of {{a nuclear power plant}} and especially in determining environmentally assisted crack growth rates of structural materials. Furthermore, the new design enables simultaneous testing of several samples, which helps produce more reliable statistical data in a more economical way. This thesis summarizes my work done at the Technical Research Centre of Finland over the past 9  years to increase the knowledge of factors affecting material testing devices and material properties in gas and aqueous coolants at high temperatures. The developed pneumatic servo-controlled material testing device has been used to perform crack growth rate tests as a function of stress intensity factor K for AISI  316 stainless steel and Inconel  182 weld metal in Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) coolant by using small size (10 x 10 x 55  mm) three point bending specimens. The load and displacement were controlled during these tests by the pneumatic servo-controlled fracture measuring device (PSCFM device) and based on test results crack growth rates for Inconel weld metal and AISI  316 have been calculated. During the tests, accuracy with very slow constant displacement rates of 1. 2   10 - 5  mm/min and 1. 2   10 - 6  mm/min and long term stability of the pneumatic material testing system under high temperature water environment, has been verified. Furthermore, the crack growth rate for Inconel  182 weld metal as a function of sulphate content (10, 20, 30  ppb) of BWR coolant has been determined. These results shows that the crack growth rate of Inconel  182 weld material is strongly affected by the sulphate content of BWR coolant. Furthermore, prototypes of pneumatically powered fatigue (PSCFAT-device), controlled distance electrode (PSCCDE-device) and tensile (PSCINCORE-device) devices have been designed and tested. The units, which were based on proven technology, operated well and gave reliable test results for the material design parameters. The PSCFAT device was tested at room temperature and the degree of specimen bending and general system performance were measured. A strain controlled axial fatigue test in a 12  MPa autoclave at 100 °C was also performed. The test material was AISI  316 stainless steel and the specimen failed in its midsection due to fatigue after 15600  cycles. The preliminary tests with pneumatically powered controlled distance electrode arrangement equipment (PSCCDE) is presented. The equipment was tested in air at room temperature and in typical BWR environments. The test material was pure nickel and its oxide film properties were tested in BWR environment as a function of potential. The design work for the pneumatic tensile testing device which is capable of working in a real reactor core is introduced. Prototype design, load calibrations, load frame for thin specimen tensile testing, and reactor installation with 30  m gas lines is presented. Furthermore, the PSCINCORE device was used to determine stress and strain curves for pure Cu specimen in the BR- 2 reactor at Mol in Belgium. Reactor pool water temperature was 90 °C, neutron flux ∼ 0. 3 ∗ 1014  n cm- 2 s- 1 s (E> 1  MeV) and damage rate ∼ 2 ∗ 10 - 4  h- 1. The test type was constant displacement rate test with strain rate ∼ 10 - 7   1 /s. Some of the results gained in this work are unique, whenever possible however, the test results have been verified by comparison to earlier results with alternative techniques. Invariably, the comparisons prove applicability of the pneumatically powered technology developed in this work. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The Swedish weight {{sounding}} {{test machine}} (SWS test machine) {{used in the}} in-situ ground investigation method, is easy to move, shortens test time, is simple to use for testing, and less expensive compared to mechanical boring test. However, this method cannot be used in dense sand layers and stones/cobblestones layers. An in-situ ground investigation machine, NSWS (Nippon Screw Weight System) that enables identification of super soft zones and has the functions for controlling hydraulics and <b>pneumatics</b> of <b>loading,</b> and for segmentation of measuring interval was developed by utilizing the measuring system (using load and rotational penetration resistance) of the SWS test machine. In this paper, we report {{a case in which}} the NSWS test (machine) was used for identifying the subsidence locations on the river bank made up mainly of cobble-mixed gravels. Specifically, the NSWS test (machine) was used for cobble-mixed gravel layers in the initial investigation stage with the purposes of identifying the area loosened due to ground subsidence and assessing its impact to the dam's body. In addition to the measurement results of the amount of load, the penetration rate and the number of rotations, the area loosened due to ground subsidence was identified by paying attention to the scuttle frequency considering subsidence frequency specific to a NSWS test (machine) as a parameter. The test result was verified by boring measurement, and the loosened area was relatively small at the subsidence locations. Moreover, at an early stage, it was determined that the impact on the dam's body was not devastating...|$|R
40|$|The {{enhancement}} of nonlinear PID (N-PID) controller for a pneumatic positioning system is {{proposed to improve}} the performance of this controller. This is executed by utilizing the characteristic of rate variation of the nonlinear gain that is readily available in N-PID controller. The proposed equation, namely, self-regulation nonlinear function (SNF), is used to reprocess the error signal {{with the purpose of}} generating the value of the rate variation, continuously. With the addition of this function, a new self-regulation nonlinear PID (SN-PID) controller is proposed. The proposed controller is then implemented to a variably <b>loaded</b> <b>pneumatic</b> actuator. Simulation and experimental tests are conducted with different inputs, namely, step, multistep, and random waveforms, to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique. The results obtained have been proven as a novel initiative at examining and identifying the characteristic based on a new proposal controller resulting from N-PID controller. The transient response is improved by a factor of 2. 2 times greater than previous N-PID technique. Moreover, the performance of pneumatic positioning system is remarkably good under various loads...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper will}} {{deal with the problem}} of {{establishing}} a desirable power sharing in multi-feed electric power system for future more-electric aircraft (MEA) platforms. The MEA {{is one of the major}} trends in modern aerospace engineering aiming for reduction of the overall aircraft weight, operation cost and environmental impact. Electrical systems are employed to replace existing hydraulic, <b>pneumatic</b> and mechanical <b>loads.</b> Hence the onboard installed electrical power increases significantly and this results in challenges in the design of electrical power systems (EPS). One of the key paradigms for future MEA EPS architectures assumes high-voltage dc distribution with multiple sources, possibly of different physical nature, feeding the same bus(es). In our study we investigate control approaches to guarantee that the total electric load is shared between the sources in a desirable manner. A novel communication channel based secondary control method is proposed in this paper. Stability of the proposed method is investigated and it proves that the system stability margin is upgraded using the compensation method. The analytical results of the study will be supported by both time-domain simulations and experimental results...|$|R
