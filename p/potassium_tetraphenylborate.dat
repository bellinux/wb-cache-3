40|$|As part of {{the program}} to {{disposition}} the tetraphenylborate (TPB) in Tank 48 H and return the tank to service, Salt Processing Development requested {{a review of the literature}} to assess the state of knowledge pertaining to incorporation of tetraphenylborate slurries in saltstone grout with respect to benzene generation rates and leaching performance. Examination of past studies conducted at Savannah River Site (SRS) on the incorporation of TPB slurries in saltstone provides a basis for developing a more focused scope of experimental studies. Tank 48 H currently contains <b>potassium</b> and cesium <b>tetraphenylborate</b> salts as a result of a demonstration of the In Tank Precipitation (ITP) process in 1983 and subsequent ITPradioactive start-up operations in 1995. The tank currently contains approximately 240, 000 gallons of salt solution with approximately 19, 000 kg of <b>potassium</b> and cesium <b>tetraphenylborate</b> salts. The presence of the TPB salts makes the waste incompatible with existing High Level Waste treatment facilities. The TPB salts in Tank 48 H must be treated or removed to meet the scheduled return to service date of 2007. The two preferred options for disposition of the TBP slurries in Tank 48 H include: (1) Aggregation of the material with the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) recycle stream and disposal in the Saltstone Processing Facility (SPF), and (2) In-Situ Thermal Decomposition using heat in combination with pH reduction and catalyst addition.

40|$|Tank 48 H {{return to}} service is {{critical}} to the processing of high level waste (HLW) at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Tank 48 H currently holds legacy material containing organic tetraphenylborate (TPB) compounds from the operation of the In-Tank Precipitation process. The TPB was added during an in-tank precipitation process to removed soluble cesium, but excessive benzene generation curtailed this treatment method. This material is not compatible with the waste treatment facilities at SRS and must be removed or undergo treatment to destroy the organic compounds before the tank can be returned to routine Tank Farm service. Tank 48 H currently contains approximately 240, 000 gallons of alkaline slurry with approximately 19, 000 kg (42, 000 lb) of <b>potassium</b> and cesium <b>tetraphenylborate</b> (KTPB and CsTPB). Out of Tank processing of the Tank 48 H has some distinct advantages as aggressive processing conditions (e. g., high temperature, low pH) are required for fast destruction of the tetraphenylborate. Also, a new facility can be designed with the optimum materials of construction and other design features to allow the safe processing of the Tank 48 H waste. However, it is very expensive to build a new facility. As a result, an in-tank process primarily using existing equipment and facilities is desirable. Development of an in-tank process would be economically attractive. Based on success with Fentons Chemistry (i. e., hydrogen peroxide with an iron or copper catalyst to produce hydroxyl radicals, strong oxidation agents), testing was initiated to develop a higher pH oxidation process that could be completed in-tank...|$|R
40|$|Cation-templated {{self-assembly}} of the lipophilic isoguanosine (isoG 1) {{with different}} monovalent cations (M+=Li+, Na+, K+, NH 4 +, and Cs+) was studied in solvents of different polarity by using diffusion NMR spectroscopy. Previous studies {{that did not}} use diffusion NMR techniques concluded that isoG 1 forms both pentamers (isoG 1) 5 M+ and decamers (isoG 1) 10 M+ {{in the presence of}} alkali-metal cations. The present diffusion NMR studies demonstrate, however, that isoG 1 does not form (isoG 1) 5 M+ pentamers. In fact, the diffusion NMR data indicates that both doubly charged decamers of formula (isoG 1) 102 M+ and singly charged decamers, (isoG 1) 10 M+, are formed with lithium, sodium, <b>potassium,</b> and ammonium <b>tetraphenylborate</b> salts (LiB(Ph) 4, KB(Ph) 4, NaB(Ph) 4 and NH 4 B(Ph) 4), depending on the isoG 1 :salt stoichiometry of the solution. In the presence of CsB(Ph) 4, isoG 1 affords only the singly charged decamers (isoG 1) 10 Cs+. By monitoring the diffusion coefficient of the B(Ph) 4 - ion in the different mixtures of solvents, we also concluded that the anion is more strongly associated to the doubly charged decamers (isoG 1) 102 M+ than to the singly charged decamers (isoG 1) 10 M+. The (isoG 1) 102 M+ species can, however, exist in solution without the mediation of the anion. This last conclusion was supported by the finding that the doubly charged decamers (isoG 1) 102 M+ also prevail in 1 : 1 CD 3 CN:CDCl 3, a solvent mixture in which the B(Ph) 4 - ion does not interact significantly with the self-assembled complex. These diffusion measurements, which have provided new and improved structural information about these decameric isoG 1 assemblies, demonstrate the utility of combining diffusion NMR techniques with conventional NMR methods in seeking to characterize labile, multicomponent, supramolecular systems in solution, especially those with high symmetry...|$|R

The new method permits cold chemicals field testing of installed filters to quantify particulate decontamination and verify filter integrity before going hot. The method involves a 1000 x concentration of fine particulate KTPB in the filtrate to allow direct analysis by counting for naturally radioactive isotope K- 40 using the underground SRTC gamma spectroscopy facility.

40|$|At the Savannah River Site (SRS), Tank 48 H {{currently}} holds approximately 240, 000 {{gallons of}} slurry which contains <b>potassium</b> and cesium <b>tetraphenylborate</b> (TPB). A copper catalyzed peroxide oxidation (CCPO) reaction {{is currently being}} examined as a method for destroying the TPB present in Tank 48 H. Part {{of the development of}} that process includes an examination of the fate of the Tank 48 H fissile material which is adsorbed onto monosodium titanate (MST) particles. This report details results from experiments designed to examine the potential degradation of MST during CCPO processing and the subsequent fate of the adsorbed fissile material. Experiments were conducted to simulate the CCPO process on MST solids loaded with sorbates in a simplified Tank 48 H simulant. Loaded MST solids were placed into the Tank 48 H simplified simulant without TPB, and the experiments were then carried through acid addition (pH adjustment to 11), peroxide addition, holding at temperature (50 C) for one week, and finally NaOH addition to bring the free hydroxide concentration to a target concentration of 1 M. Testing was conducted without TPB to show the maximum possible impact on MST since the competing oxidation of TPB with peroxide was absent. In addition, the Cu catalyst was also omitted, which will maximize the interaction of H{sub 2 }O{sub 2 } with the MST; however, the results may be non-conservative assuming the Cu-peroxide active intermediate is more reactive than the peroxide radical itself. The study found that both U and Pu desorb from the MST when the peroxide addition begins, although to different extents. Virtually all of the U goes into solution {{at the beginning of the}} peroxide addition, whereas Pu reaches a maximum of {approx} 34 % leached during the peroxide addition. Ti from the MST was also found to come into solution during the peroxide addition. Therefore, Ti is present with the fissile in solution. After the peroxide addition is complete, the Pu and Ti are found to precipitate from solution, while the U remains in solution throughout the remaining processes, including pH adjustment to 1 M free hydroxide. The Ti is likely forming a peroxotitanate material, which can then resorb the leached Pu from solution, but has a low affinity for U. Since Pu was not detected in the SEMEDS studies, it cannot be conclusively determined in what form the Pu returns to the solids; however, the Pu likely resorbed onto the peroxotitanate material. Based on the results of this experiment, Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) recommends the following experiments to further examine the fate of fissile material in CCPO processing of Tank 48 H: (1) Repeat with full simulant matrix (organic and Cu catalyst present along with simulated radioactive sludge); and (2) Repeat of the above test after selection of final conditions (i. e., pH, temperature) if they differ from conditions tested...|$|R
40|$|Tank 48 H {{return to}} service is {{critical}} to the processing of high level waste (HLW) at Savannah River Site (SRS). Liquid Waste Disposition (LWD) management has the goal of returning Tank 48 H to routine service by January 2010 or as soon as practical. Tank 48 H currently holds legacy material containing organic tetraphenylborate (TPB) compounds from the operation of the In-Tank Precipitation process. This material is not compatible with the waste treatment facilities at SRS and must be removed or undergo treatment to destroy the organic compounds before the tank can be returned to Tank Farm service. Tank 48 H currently contains {approx} 240, 000 gallons of alkaline slurry with about 2 wt % <b>potassium</b> and cesium <b>tetraphenylborate</b> (KTPB and CsTPB). The main radioactive component in Tank 48 H is {sup 137 }Cs. The waste also contains {approx} 0. 15 wt % Monosodium Titanate (MST) which has adsorbed {sup 90 }Sr, U, and Pu isotopes. A System Engineering Evaluation of technologies/ideas for the treatment of TPB identified Wet Air Oxidation (WAO) as a leading alternative technology to the baseline aggregation approach. Over 75 technologies/ideas were evaluated overall. Forty-one technologies/ideas passed the initial screening evaluation. The 41 technologies/ideas were then combined to 16 complete solutions for the disposition of TPB and evaluated in detail. Wet Air Oxidation (WAO) is an aqueous phase process in which soluble or suspended waste components are oxidized using molecular oxygen contained in air. The process operates at elevated temperatures and pressures ranging from 150 to 320 C and 7 to 210 atmospheres, respectively. The products of the reaction are CO{sub 2 }, H{sub 2 }O, and low molecular weight oxygenated organics (e. g. acetate, oxalate). The basic flow scheme for a typical WAO system is as follows. The waste solution or slurry is pumped through a high-pressure feed pump. An air stream containing sufficient oxygen to meet the oxygen requirements of the waste stream is injected into the pressurized waste stream, and the air/liquid mixture is preheated to the required reactor inlet temperature. The reactor provides sufficient retention time to allow the oxidation to approach the desired level of organic decomposition. Typical reaction time is about 30 - 120 minutes. Heat exchangers are routinely employed to recover energy contained in the reactor effluent to preheat the waste feed/air entering the reactor. Auxiliary energy, usually steam, is necessary for startup and can provide trim heat if required. Since the oxidation reactions are exothermic, sufficient energy may be released in the reactor to allow the WAO system to operate without any additional heat input. After cooling, the oxidized reactor effluent passes through a pressure control valve where the pressure is reduced. A separator downstream of the pressure control valve allows the depressurized and cooled vapor to separate from the liquid. Typical industrial WAO applications have a feed flow rate of 1 to 220 gallons per minute (gpm) per train, with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) from 10, 000 to 150, 000 mg/L (higher CODs with dilution). Note that catalysts, such as homogeneous copper and iron, their heterogeneous counterparts, or precious metals can be used to enhance the effectiveness (i. e., to lower temperature, pressure, and residence time as well as increase oxidation efficiencies) of the WAO reaction if deemed necessary...|$|R

Liquid benzene was added volumetrically to the slurry in 25 -mL vials and agitated to create a suspension. Earlier tests using dyed benzene showed that benzene remains suspended permanently in the slurry and the only visible change is overall slurry settling. Gentle vial agitation restores the original suspension state. To simulate in-situ uniformly dispersed benzene, benzene/KTPB samples were homogenized using a high speed rotor/stator biological homogenizer. Photomicrographs using homogenized samples containing dyed benzene showed no residual benzene droplets and fairly uniform coloration of the KTPB solids structure.

The lack of benzene vapor pressure suppression in these tests indicate that for a 6. 5 wt percent solids KTPB slurry in 4. 65 M Na+ salt solution at approximately 25 degrees Celsius, no significant difference exists between the solubility of benzene in the slurry and the solubility of benzene in salt solution without KTPB solids. The work showed similar results in slurry with 6, 000 mg/L sludge and 2, 000 mg/L monosodium titanate added.

40|$|During {{the initial}} months of In-Tank Precipitation {{radioactive}} operation in 1995 the process experienced {{high rates of}} tetraphenylborate decomposition with assumed corresponding high rates of benzene generation. In March 1996 after a two month quiescent period, a water addition to Tank 48 H resulted in an unexpected benzene release to the tank vapor phase. This {{was the first time}} a low energy input resulted in a significant release rate. This led to questions about how benzene, generated in-situ by TPB decomposition, was retained in the surrounding <b>potassium</b> <b>tetraphenylborate</b> slurry. It was postulated the retention mechanism may have changed during the quiescent period prior to March so the benzene present became readily releasable to the vapor phase with low energy input to the slurry or that enough benzene accumulated that some of it was in a different, more releasable form. Readily releasable is a qualitative term defined as a rapid release of benzene at a rate approaching evaporation of a free benzene layer. It is intended to distinguish between benzene in a form with high liquid phase resistance to mass transfer diffusion controlled from benzene in a form with minimal liquid phase resistance to mass transfer free benzene layer evaporation. If a readily releasable form of benzene was present, the vapor space profile during release tests was anticipated to have an initial benzene vapor space concentration peak followed by a lower vapor concentration, longer duration release...|$|E

These demonstrations were supported by Savannah River Remediation (SRR) and the Department of Energy (DOE) has concurred with the SRR recommendation to proceed with the deployment of the FBSR technology to treat {{the contents of}} Tank 48 H. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) developed and proved the concept with non-radioactive simulants for SRR beginning in 2003. By 2008, several pilot scale campaigns had been completed and extensive crucible testing and bench scale testing were performed in the SRNL Shielded Cells using Tank 48 H radioactive sample. SRNL developed a Tank 48 H non-radioactive simulant complete with organic compounds, salt, and metals characteristic of those measured in a sample of the radioactive contents of Tank 48 H. FBSR Pilot Scaled Testing with the Tank 48 H simulant has demonstrated the ability to remove greater than 98 % of the nitrites and greater than 99. 5 % of the nitrates from the Tank 48 H simulant, and to form a solid product that is primarily alkali carbonate. The alkali carbonate is soluble and, thus, amenable to pumping as a liquid to downstream facilities for processing. The FBSR technology was demonstrated in October of 2006 in the Engineering Scale Test Demonstration (ESTD) pilot scale steam reformer at the Hazen Research Inc. (HRI) facility in Golden, CO. Additional ESTD tests were completed in 2008 and in 2009 that further demonstrated the TTT steam reforming process ability to destroy organics in the Tank 48 simulant and produce a soluble carbonate waste form. The ESTD was operated at varying feed rates and Denitration and Mineralization Reformer (DMR) temperatures, and at a constant Carbon Reduction Reformer (CRR) temperature of 950 C. The process produced a dissolvable carbonate product suitable for processing downstream. ESTD testing was performed in 2009 at the Hazen facility to demonstrate the long term operability of an integrated FBSR processing system with carbonate product and carbonate slurry handling capability. The final testing demonstrated the integrated TTT FBSR capability to process the Tank 48 simulant from a slurry feed into a greater than 99. 9 % organic free and primarily dissolved carbonate FBSR product slurry.
