25|$|Although the Haber {{process is}} mainly {{used to produce}} {{fertilizer}} today, during World War I it provided Germany with a source of ammonia for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosives,</b> compensating for the Allied trade blockade on Chilean saltpeter.|$|E
25|$|The main {{industrial}} use of nitric acid {{is for the}} production of fertilizers. Nitric acid is neutralized with ammonia to give ammonium nitrate. This application consumes 75–80% of the 26M tons produced annually (1987). The other main applications are for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosives,</b> nylon precursors, and specialty organic compounds.|$|E
25|$|After the Hitler's rise {{to power}} in 1933 the company {{gradually}} began to concentrate on raw materials for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosives.</b> Since 1937 women were employed as workers. After the outbreak of World War II, with the maleworkforce in military service, women were conscripted for work at the company. Since 1940 Chemische Fabrik Kalk used approximately 460 forced laborers from Poland and later the Soviet Union. The factory was heavily damaged during the bombing raids which started in 1942. In 1943 the sulfuric acid plant was completely destroyed, a year later {{almost all of the}} production came to a standstill. On March 6, 1945 the grandson of the founder, Fritz Vorster Jr. closed the factory after 80 percent of the production facilities had been destroyed. At this time the company had only 100 employees.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} the war {{the treaty}} of Versailles forced Chemische Werke Kalk to end the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> and close the {{research}} laboratory. In the 1920s demand for fertilizers slowly increased, but was accompanied by an increase in prices for raw materials. To mitigate the effect of the price increases the company began to produce a fertilizer based on ammonium nitrate and calcium carbonate, two by-products of the production of other fertilizers. In 1930 Scheibler’s Kampdünger (Kamp standing for Kalk-Ammon-Phospor, i.e. lime-ammonium-phosphorus and Dünger being the German word for fertilizer) was introduced, a two-component fertilizer that was readily accepted by the market. The company management at this time considered moving the factory from Kalk to Godorf in Rodenkirchen as the high population density made expansion of the factory difficult. Ultimately this plan was not implemented.|$|E
25|$|Sulfuric acid {{is a very}} {{important}} commodity chemical, and indeed, a nation's sulfuric acid production is a good indicator of its industrial strength. World production in 2004 was about 180 million tonnes, with the following geographic distribution: Asia 35%, North America (including Mexico) 24%, Africa 11%, Western Europe 10%, Eastern Europe and Russia 10%, Australia and Oceania 7%, South America 7%. Most of this amount (≈60%) is consumed for fertilizers, particularly superphosphates, ammonium phosphate and ammonium sulfates. About 20% is used in chemical industry for production of detergents, synthetic resins, dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, petroleum catalysts, insecticides and antifreeze, as well as in various processes such as oil well acidicizing, aluminium reduction, paper sizing, water treatment. About 6% of uses are related to pigments and include paints, enamels, printing inks, coated fabrics and paper, and the rest is dispersed into a multitude of applications such as <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosives,</b> cellophane, acetate and viscose textiles, lubricants, non-ferrous metals and batteries.|$|E
25|$|The Hercules site gained {{independence}} from Dupont {{as a result}} of federal anti-trust action in 1912. Hercules Powder Company contributed significantly to the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosives</b> during both World Wars. By the Second World War, the plant had diversified to produce fertilizers and other chemical products. Eventually the facility was out-competed by foreign manufacturers, and the plant was closed in 1976. However, by this time the surrounding area was experiencing rapid growth as the commuter belt moved further outward from San Francisco. By the mid-1970s, home construction companies began to build new subdivisions and changed Hercules into the residential suburb as it was known up until the late 1990s. Back in the 1970s, Hercules {{was one of the first}} cities in the United States to develop a comprehensive Noise Element of the General Plan. This work included the production of noise contour maps for all major highways and arterial roads, as well as a citywide mitigation plan. Considerable study has been made of the heavy metal lead accumulated as upper layer soil contamination from prior air pollution smokestack emissions from the California Powder Works operations from this era.|$|E
