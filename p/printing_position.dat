50|$|Printing control {{characters}} were first {{used to control}} the physical mechanism of printers, the earliest output device. An early implementation of this idea was the out-of-band ASA carriage control characters. Later, control {{characters were}} integrated into the stream of data to be printed.The carriage return character (CR), when sent to such a device, causes it to put the character {{at the edge of}} the paper at which writing begins (it may, or may not, also move the <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> to the next line).The line feed character (LF/NL) causes the device to put the <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> on the next line. It may (or may not), depending on the device and its configuration, also move the <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> to the start of the next line (whichever direction is first—left in Western languages and right in Hebrew and Arabic). The vertical and horizontal tab characters (VT and HT/TAB) cause the output device to move the <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> to the next tab stop in the direction of reading. The form feed character (FF/NP) starts a new sheet of paper, and may or may not move to the start of the first line. The backspace character (BS) moves the <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> one character space backwards. On printers, this is most often used so the printer can overprint characters to make other, not normally available, characters. On terminals and other electronic output devices, there are often software (or hardware) configuration choices which will allow a destruct backspace (i.e., a BS, SP, BS sequence) which erases, or a non-destructive one which does not. The shift in and shift out characters (SO and SI) selected alternate character sets, fonts, underlining or other printing modes. Escape sequences were often used to do the same thing.|$|E
5000|$|... (U+008D REVERSE LINE FEED, ISO/IEC 6429 8D, decimal 141) {{is used to}} {{move the}} <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> back one line (by reverse feeding the paper, or by moving a display cursor up one line) so that other {{characters}} may be printed over existing text. This may be done to make them bolder, or to add underlines, strike-throughs or other characters such as diacritics.|$|E

5000|$|Similarly, [...] (U+008B PARTIAL LINE FORWARD, decimal 139) and [...] (U+008C PARTIAL LINE BACKWARD, decimal 140) {{can be used}} {{to advance}} or reverse the text <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> by some {{fraction}} of the vertical line spacing (typically, half). These can be used in combination for subscripts (by advancing and then reversing) and superscripts (by reversing and then advancing), and may also be useful for printing diacritics.|$|E
5000|$|The {{device was}} made by linking two 28-key piano-style {{keyboards}} by wire. Each piano key represented a letter of the alphabet and when pressed caused the corresponding letter to print at the receiving end. A [...] "shift" [...] key gave each main key two optional values. A 56-character typewheel at the sending end was synchronised to coincide with a similar wheel at the receiving end. If the key corresponding to a particular character was pressed at the home station, it actuated the typewheel at the distant station just as the same character moved into the <b>printing</b> <b>position,</b> in a way similar to the daisy wheel printer. It was thus {{an example of a}} synchronous data transmission system.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{meaning of this}} character was like NOP - when sent to a printer or a terminal, it does nothing (some terminals, however, incorrectly display it as space). When electromechanical teleprinters were used as computer output devices, one or more null characters were sent {{at the end of}} each printed line to allow time for the mechanism to return to the first <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> on the next line. On punched tape, the character is represented with no holes at all, so a new unpunched tape is initially filled with null characters, and often text could be [...] "inserted" [...] at a reserved space of null characters by punching the new characters into the tape over the nulls.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{a printer}} output line {{transistor}} would fail, {{resulting in a}} blank <b>print</b> <b>position.</b> If you knew your way around inside the 1130, {{it was possible to}} swap circuit cards so as to move the bad <b>print</b> <b>position</b> to near the right end of the printed line. This kept the 1130 usable until the repair person showed up.|$|R

5000|$|The {{line printer}} ran at 600 lines per minute, using a {{continuously}} rotating print drum technology, with letters, figures and punctuation marks distributed around the drum at each column. 132 solenoid-operated flat-faced print hammers comprised a print line, with ten characters to the inch. When a desired character {{arrived at the}} <b>printing</b> <b>position,</b> as indicated by timing marks {{on the end of}} the drum, a thyratron would fire and energize a print column solenoid, propelling its hammer to the back face of the printing paper. The paper would be bounced against a wide inked ribbon and against the drum, printing the desired character. The hammer would then rebound with a spring to await the next thyraton firing and the process would repeat on the next line down the sheet. Drum printers, when not adjusted properly, or due to component wear would mis-register the character vertically.|$|E
5000|$|By 1846, the Morse {{telegraph}} service was operational between Washington, D.C., and New York. Royal Earl House patented his printing telegraph that same year. He linked two 28-key piano-style keyboards by wire. Each piano key represented {{a letter of}} the alphabet and when pressed caused the corresponding letter to print at the receiving end. A [...] "shift" [...] key gave each main key two optional values. A 56-character typewheel at the sending end was synchronised to coincide with a similar wheel at the receiving end. If the key corresponding to a particular character was pressed at the home station, it actuated the typewheel at the distant station just as the same character moved into the <b>printing</b> <b>position,</b> in a way similar to the daisy wheel printer. It was thus {{an example of a}} synchronous data transmission system. House's equipment could transmit around 40 instantly readable words per minute, but was difficult to manufacture in bulk. The printer could copy and print out up to 2,000 words per hour. This invention was first put in operation and exhibited at the Mechanics Institute in New York in 1844.|$|E
50|$|The patent {{describes}} Burt's machine {{as having}} a set of typeface characters that were arranged on the under side {{of a set of}} parts that had a lever pivoted to swing vertically and horizontally. The desired typeface character is brought to the printing point by moving this lever horizontally to a position over the same character in the index, and the impression on the paper is made by then depressing the lever. Different styles of typeface characters could be used. They were arranged in two rows on a lever. The rows of typeface characters could be shifted on the lever to bring either one to the printing point. The paper was carried in an endless band that traveled crosswise of the machine and the band was moved for letter space by the impression lever every time the lever is depressed to print. The line space was made by shifting the frame carrying the printing mechanism toward the front or rear of the machine, with the paper remaining stationary. Ink-pads were located at each side of the impression point, and all the typeface characters, except the one in the <b>printing</b> <b>position,</b> were inked every time the impression lever was depressed. Upper and lower case typeface letters could be used. A dial was provided that indicated the length of paper (inches) which had passed the printing point in printing each line. The operator knew the width of the paper being used each time. There was a stop printing indicator for end of the line.|$|E

40|$|Scanning a {{halftone}} image introduces halftone artifacts, {{known as}} Moire patterns, which significantly degrade the image quality. Printers that use amplitude modulation (AM) screening for halftone <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> dots in a periodic pattern. Therefore, frequencies relating half toning arc easily identifiable {{in the frequency}} domain. This paper proposes a method for de screening scanned color halftone images using a custom band reject filter designed to isolate and remove only the frequencies related to half toning while leaving image edges sharp without image segmentation or edge detection. To enable hardware acceleration, the image is processed in small overlapped windows. The windows arc filtered individually in the frequency domain, then pieced back together in a method that does not show blocking artifacts...|$|E

The position of the printed character string issometimeslargely shifted from itsdesignated position,and there may be two or more directionsin spite of one sheet of paper. There are variouscauses, the performance of the printer, a mistake in the <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> designed by the software,a variation in the cell positionscaused by the publishersand by the publishing dates, or even a mistake of the handwriting position. We developed a recognition method for determining which character stringsare to be read in such difficult situations. A method for determining the correspondence of character strings to cellswith a very high successratio wasdeveloped. Thismethod isbased on local and global rules,and effective control of these rules. It wasestimated to have a 99. 2 % successratio using an experiment on 11, 387 character strings. 1...|$|E
30|$|When {{the main}} {{application}} of a geometric model is used for visualization and subtractive manufacturing, explicit geometric modeling methods, such as triangle meshes and parametric geometric surfaces are preferred. However, when a geometric object is modeled for AM, implicitly represented geometric objects are preferred, owing to several distinct advantages of implicit geometric representation over the explicit methods. First, an implicit geometric form is directly defined in the physical space, {{rather than in the}} parametric space, and consequently, it can directly provide a 3 D printer with precise information about where to lay a printing substance particle. It is a 3 D printing ready representation, and no conversion procedure is required. In general, an implicit function can be viewed both as a surface and as a volumetric solid, and it can describe not only the external appearance of an object but also its interior geometric structure and material properties. Second, implicit geometric modeling is a lightweight geometric modeling technique. Unlike geometric objects represented by data-intensive forms such as triangle meshes and point clouds, which often have data of size of over several megabytes, implicitly represented shapes do not in general involve the use of massive data sets, and consequently, do not require a massive storage space. Because of this, implicitly represented geometric objects are also internet and cloud computing-friendly, as it is extremely convenient to transport implicitly represented geometric objects across the internet without any restrictions on the bandwidth of the data transformation over the internet. Another impressive feature of implicit geometric objects is that implicit techniques allow for parallel design, owing to the fact that implicitly modeled objects can be easily combined together [14 – 17], which makes implicit modeling particularly suitable for the shape design over a distributed or a CAD system with parallel architecture. In addition, implicitly represented geometric models have a collision-detection efficient representation. A 3 D object printing operation is in general a process of interaction between a digitally represented geometric object and the printing device, where collision-detection operations have to be constantly performed to test whether a move from the current <b>printing</b> <b>position</b> to the next one is allowed. It is quite straightforward and efficient to perform a collision-detection operation between two objects, when one of them is presented in the implicit form (say, the geometric model) and the other one is in the explicit form (say, the position of 3 D printer head).|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} drum printer design, a fixed font {{character}} set is engraved onto {{the periphery of}} a number of print wheels, the number matching the number of columns (letters in a line) the printer could print. The wheels, joined to form a large drum (cylinder), spin at high speed and paper and an inked ribbon is stepped (moved) past the <b>print</b> <b>position.</b> As the desired character for each column passes the <b>print</b> <b>position,</b> a hammer strikes the paper from the rear and presses the paper against the ribbon and the drum, causing the desired character to be recorded on the continuous paper. Because the drum carrying the letterforms (characters) remains in constant motion, the strike-and-retreat action of the hammers had to be very fast. Typically, they were driven by voice coils mounted on the moving part of the hammer.|$|R

50|$|In 1949 IBM {{introduced}} the IBM 407 Accounting Machine with a wheel print mechanism that could print 150 alphanumeric lines a minute. Each of the 120 <b>print</b> <b>positions</b> {{had its own}} type wheel which rotated under electromechanical control. Once all were in <b>position,</b> <b>print</b> hammers struck the wheels against a ribbon and the paper. The 407 or its wheel line printer mechanism was attached {{to a variety of}} early IBM computers, including the IBM 650, most members of the IBM 700/7000 series and the IBM 1130, the last introduced in 1965.|$|R
5000|$|The 407 was {{the central}} {{component}} of many unit record equipment shops which were the mainstay of IBM's business at the time.

It could print digits, letters and several special characters in any of 120 <b>print</b> <b>positions,</b> spaced 0.1 in.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the model 1403, IBM printers utilized technology originally developed for their line of accounting machines. Models 402 and 405 used type bars. These were vertical bars, one for each <b>print</b> <b>position.</b> Each bar was one character wide with either the entire alphabet, including numerals and symbols, or just numerals & symbols only, molded into the front surface, in a single column. In printing, each bar was raised up until the correct character for that <b>print</b> <b>position</b> was opposite the paper, whereupon the bar was pushed toward the paper, so that the correct numeral or letter pressed against the ribbon, striking the paper much the way type slugs leave an impression on paper in a standard typewriter. This action was relatively slow, as it took time for each bar to be brought up into the correct position and then drop back down in preparation to print the next line.|$|R

50|$|The {{operation}} of the 407 was directed {{by the use of}} a removable control panel and a carriage tape. Exit hubs (impulse emitting) on the control panel are wired to entry hubs (impulse accepting) for the task to be done (see Wiring of unit record equipment). There are hubs for each card column (at both reading stations), <b>print</b> <b>position,</b> counter digit, and so on. Logic tests were also available.|$|R
5000|$|Counter total exits. A counter's Total {{entry hub}} caused that counter to emit total pulses {{which could be}} wired to <b>print</b> <b>positions.</b> After a total was printed, the counter was reset. Special {{circuits}} allowed negative values to be printed correctly, not as nines complements, and a special exit was provided to allow an appropriate symbol ("cr" [...] or [...] "-") to be printed next to the number when it was negative.|$|R
50|$|The {{line printer}} could print 600 lines of 120 {{characters}} per minute. It used a print barrel {{made up of}} 120 print wheels each with 50 characters around its edge. Each of the 120 <b>print</b> <b>positions</b> had a <b>print</b> hammer which when fired squeezed the paper and an inked ribbon between itself and the rotating print barrel {{for a fraction of}} a second. It is reputed to be the first commercially produced barrel printer.|$|R
5000|$|For printing, the 407 used type wheels, an {{improvement}} over earlier tabulators that used print bars. The 48-character wheels were stationary until a character impulse was to be printed; the wheel then rotated in two steps. the first step rotated each wheel to one of 12 groups of characters based on the digit impulse associated with that <b>print</b> <b>position.</b> Digit impulses included the digits 1 through 9 (in reverse order), the 8-3 and 8-4 combination punches and a group (N) for no digit impulse. One of four characters in each group was then selected based on the zone impulse (0, 11, 12 or none) for that character position. This selection happened {{at the same time}} the type wheel was driven against the ribbon. The timing of the zone impulse selection was controlled by a complex set of linkages and electromagnets called the Analyzer, one for each of the 120 <b>print</b> <b>positions.</b> Each type wheel also emitted an impulse (called [...] "echo") for the character actually printed. The control panel could be wired so the echo impulses were accumulated for totals; report totals then reliably reflected what had actually been printed.|$|R
