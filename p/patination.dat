5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of maintenance, the {{protective}} lacquer covering Knife Edge Two Piece degraded and exposed the surface of the sculpture to the elements. This resulted in oxidation of the bronze metal. Subsequent deterioration of the <b>patination</b> and years of graffiti scratched into the surface resulted in further corrosion. The conservation aimed to remove the remaining protective lacquer and surface dirt, and to remove the result of corrosion and oxidation from the sculpture, and take the surface back to the bare metal. Following the removal of graffiti the sculpture was repatinated to return it to its original colour. It was finally waxed with a weatherproof surface to protect it from future damage. The conservation work was undertaken by Rupert Harris Conservation, working in consultation with the Henry Moore Foundation. The cost of the conservation was £16,190, with £11,000 contributed by the Henry Moore Foundation.|$|E
25|$|The rate of <b>patination</b> {{conversion}} {{is dependent}} upon copper’s exposure to moisture, salt, and acidity from acid-forming pollutants. In marine climates, the entire <b>patination</b> process can take seven to nine years. In industrial environments, patina formation reaches its final stage in about fifteen to twenty-five years. In clean rural atmospheres with low concentrations of airborne sulfur dioxide, the final stage may take ten to thirty years to develop. In arid environments, a patina may not form at all if the moisture is insufficient. Where <b>patination</b> does take place in arid environments, it may mature to an ebony or nut brown. In all environments except the coastal areas, <b>patination</b> takes longer for vertical surfaces due to more rapid water runoff.|$|E
25|$|Chemically induced patina. Architects {{sometimes}} {{request a}} particular patina color at installation.

5000|$|Henri Lhote {{referred}} to these engravings in his major work, Les Gravures rupestres du Sud-oranais, which he published in 1970 {{in the series}} of the Mémoires du Centre de recherches anthropologiques préhistoriques et ethnographiques (CRAPE). For him they could not [...] "be separated archaeologically from those of south Oran, because they show with some variations the same style, the same technical formulae, the same <b>patinations</b> and the same fauna"(p. 194). It may therefore be possible to analyse them making use of the hypotheses and the classification which he developed. The engravings of the Djelfa region appeared to him like [...] "foreign works, which are a copying (always of inferior quality) from those of south Oran", (p. 193), a region which for the author was [...] "the principal centre of the rock art of the pre-Saharan regions." [...] Some belong to the earliest stage of the large-scale Hartebeest school, like [...] "The Apollo of Ouled Naïl", others are more recent or indeed (stylistically) more decadent.|$|R
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of Deakin University and Geoffrey BartlettIt {{is no wonder}} that sea shells dot Geoffrey Bartlett's Collingwood studio. Their calcified forms, the encrusted shapes of once-living creatures, stand as constant reminders of the creative wonders of natural process. Bartlett's sculptures are wrought with the sensitive artistic grasp of just such natural biological formations and the works' soft <b>patinations,</b> worn surfaces and lyrical shapes are always formed and informed by a keen sense of the appropriate and an artistic respect for materials. This is why Bartlett holds a special personal fondness for the eroded shapes and flowing beauty of the Elgin Marbles in London's British Museum and the Niké, the Victory of Samothrace, in the Louvre Museum in Paris. This is also why his sculptures so often have the peculiar aesthetic appropriateness of a mussel on a pier or a barnacle on a board. It is this aptness that lends to the forms of his constructed sculptures their powerful animistic and biological suggestions. No contemporary sculptor in Australia is so attuned to the artistic messages of Nature. Open Acces...|$|R
25|$|The copper patinas {{are very}} thin: just 0.05080–0.07620millimeters in thickness. Yet, {{they are highly}} {{adherent}} to the underlying copper metal. The initial and intermediate oxide and sulfide patina films are not particularly corrosion resistant. The final sulfate patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to all forms of atmospheric corrosion and protects the underlying metal against further weathering. As <b>patination</b> progresses and the durable sulfate layer forms, the rate of corrosion decreases, averaging between 0.0001–0.0003millimeters per year. For a 0.6millimeter-thick sheet, this equates to less than 5% corrosion {{over a period of}} 100 years. Further information is available on copper <b>patination.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the number}} of {{variables}} involved, chemically induced patinas are prone to problems such as a lack of adhesion, excessive staining of adjacent materials, and inability to achieve reasonable color uniformity over large surface areas. Chemical <b>patination</b> applied in the field is not recommended due to variations in temperature, humidity, and chemical requirements. Warranties are prudent when purchasing pre-patinated copper for architectural projects.|$|E
25|$|The Curmsun Disc {{underwent}} electron {{microscopic analysis}} at Lunds University in Sweden. The analysis showed a non-homogeneousthat alloy {{and a gold}} content ranging between 83,3-92,8%. The surface and alloy showed characteristics typical for artifacts created during the latest part of early middle ages. No traces of modern processes or chemicals were discovered. Surface analysis by a gemologist, Jonny Westling, appointed by Swedish Chamber of Commerce and Lloyds/Brookfield Underwriting, showed natural inclusions and <b>patination.</b>|$|E
25|$|Copper’s <b>patination</b> {{process is}} complex. It starts {{immediately}} on {{exposure to the}} environment with the initial formation of copper oxide conversion films that are noticeable within six months. Weathering may be uneven at first but the film becomes even after about nine months. Within the first few years, cuprous and cupric sulfide conversion films darken the surface to browns and then dull slate gray or dull black. Continued weathering transforms the sulfide films to sulfates, which are the notable blue-green or gray-green patinas.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{coloring}} {{of metals}} {{is an art}} involving craftsmanship and experience. Coloring techniques depend upon time, temperature, surface preparation, humidity and other variables. Pre-patinated copper sheets are produced by fabricators under controlled environments using patented chemical processes. Green patina finishes are primarily developed using acid chloride or acid sulfate. Treatments with ammonium chloride (sal ammoniac), cuprous chloride/hydrochloric acid, and ammonium sulfate are somewhat successful. Statuary finishes can be produced in light, medium, and dark brown, depending on the concentration and number of coloring applications. One advantage is that the treatment disguises surface markings on bright mill finish copper and can advance the natural <b>patination</b> process.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} hoard had a {{group of}} 72 pieces with similar <b>patination</b> and soil crusting, suggesting common burial. There were 7 Mkporo; 19 Nkobnkob-round foot; 9 Nkobnkob-oval foot; and 37 Popo-square foot. The lightest 'Nkobnkobs' in the hoard were 108 gm and 114 gm, while they are routinely found (called Onoudu) under 80 gm, this implies that the group was buried {{at a certain point}} in the size devolution of the manilla. Mkporo are made of brass. The weight correspondence of the oval-foot Nkobnkob with {{the high end of the}} round-foot range suggests that it is either the earlier variety, or contemporary with the earliest round-foots. The exclusive presence of the 'square-foot' variety of French Popo, normally scarce among circulation groups of Popos, suggests that this is the earliest variety. The earliest French manillas as likely to be contemporaries of the earliest British pieces.|$|E
25|$|Nine inscribed copper plates {{thought to}} belong to the mature Harappan phase (2600 - 1900 BCE), are thought to be used for printing. The Indus {{characters}} in the plates are mirrored, and the loss in groove definition indicates repeated cleaning and polishing of the surface. The plates are also significantly larger than any seal, and much thicker, the thickness thought to help support pressure applied to their surface. The large nature of the plates makes them an unlikely candidate for seals as the tablets thus produced would be prone to breakage. The metal composition of the plates were characteristic for that period and location, and showed significant corrosion, indicating its ancient nature. Continuing <b>patination</b> {{across the surface of the}} plate, including on the lines, indicates that the marks were not made recently on an ancient piece of metal. On testing the plates for printing using two kinds of ink (water and oil based) onto rag paper, silk and parchment, the results on all three materials were found to be of remarkable quality. All these suggest that these plates point to the first known examples of printing in the world. One of the plates contains 34 characters, the largest number of characters found so far on any single object from Indus findings.|$|E

50|$|Rokushō (緑青) is a {{traditional}} Japanese compound for inducing <b>patination</b> in decorative non-ferrous metals, especially several alloys which are nearly unknown outside Japan. Shakudō, an alloy of copper and gold, becomes dark blue-violet; shibuichi, an alloy of fine silver and copper in a higher percentage than sterling, turns misty aquamarine; and kuromido dark coppery black. These alloys are becoming increasingly popular in high-end artistic jewelry, especially in bi-metals (a layer of the alloy fused to another metal such as sterling). Rokushō was generally used to patinate all types of mokume-gane as well. Although other <b>patination</b> agents {{can be used on}} these metals, some artisans prefer the rich colors achieved through traditional Rokushō.|$|E
50|$|Shakudō (赤銅) is a billon of {{gold and}} copper (typically 4-10% gold, 96-90% copper) {{which can be treated}} to form an indigo/black patina {{resembling}} lacquer. Unpatinated shakudō visually resembles bronze; the dark color is induced by applying and heating rokushō, a special <b>patination</b> formula.|$|E

50|$|Because Rokushō has a {{dramatically}} different effect on sterling silver {{than on the}} alloys typically fused to it in bi-metals, a common technique in art jewelry is to engrave through the alloy layer in a pattern to reveal the silver underneath prior to <b>patination.</b> This provides a rich contrast in color, highlighting the pattern.|$|E
