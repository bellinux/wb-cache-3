5|$|Anarchism is a {{political}} <b>philosophy</b> <b>that</b> advocates self-governed societies based on voluntary institutions. These are often described as stateless societies, although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-hierarchical or free associations.|$|E
5|$|Artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci, often {{working with}} naturalists, were also {{interested}} in the bodies of animals and humans, studying physiology in detail and contributing {{to the growth of}} anatomical knowledge. The traditions of alchemy and natural magic, especially in the work of Paracelsus, also laid claim to knowledge of the living world. Alchemists subjected organic matter to chemical analysis and experimented liberally with both biological and mineral pharmacology. This {{was part of a larger}} transition in world views (the rise of the mechanical <b>philosophy)</b> <b>that</b> continued into the 17th century, as the traditional metaphor of nature as organism was replaced by the nature as machine metaphor.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between Church and State, a legacy of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian <b>philosophy</b> <b>that</b> guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E

5|$|Gelsomina's {{difficulties}} with her forced partnership {{are the subject}} of frequent soul searching. Before Zampanò's release from prison, Il Matto proposes that there are alternatives to Gelsomina's servitude, and imparts his <b>philosophy</b> <b>that</b> everything and everyone has a purpose – even a pebble, even her. A nun suggests that Gelsomina's purpose in life is comparable to her own. But, when Gelsomina offers Zampanò marriage, he brushes her off.|$|E
5|$|Haywood was an {{advocate}} of industrial unionism, a labor <b>philosophy</b> <b>that</b> favors organizing all workers in an industry under one union, regardless of the specific trade or skill level; this was {{in contrast to the}} craft unions that were prevalent at the time, such as the AFL. His belief that workers of all ethnicities should be united also clashed with many unions. His preference for direct action over political tactics alienated him from the Socialist Party leadership and contributed to his recall from the party's executive committee in 1913.|$|E
5|$|In {{early modern}} Europe, the {{systematic}} study of fossils emerged {{as an integral part}} of the changes in natural <b>philosophy</b> <b>that</b> occurred during the Age of Reason. In the Italian Renaissance, Leonardo Da Vinci made various significant contributions to the field as well designed numerous fossils. At the end of the 18th century Georges Cuvier's work established comparative anatomy as a scientific discipline and, by proving that some fossil animals resembled no living ones, demonstrated that animals could become extinct, leading to the emergence of paleontology. The expanding knowledge of the fossil record also played an increasing role in the development of geology, particularly stratigraphy.|$|E

5|$|In {{early modern}} Europe, the {{systematic}} study of fossils emerged {{as an integral part}} of the changes in natural <b>philosophy</b> <b>that</b> occurred during the Age of Reason. The nature of fossils and their relationship to life in the past became better understood during the 17th and 18th centuries, and at the end of the 18th century the work of Georges Cuvier ended a long running debate about the reality of extinction and led to the emergence of paleontology, in association with comparative anatomy, as a scientific discipline. The expanding knowledge of the fossil record also played an increasing role in the development of geology, particularly stratigraphy.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{wrote his}} most {{important}} philosophical works during his years with Lord Shelburne. In a series of major metaphysical texts published between 1774 and 1780—An Examination of Dr. Reid's Inquiry into the Human Mind (1774), Hartley's Theory of the Human Mind on the Principle of the Association of Ideas (1775), Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit (1777), The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated (1777), and Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever (1780)—he argues for a <b>philosophy</b> <b>that</b> incorporates four concepts: determinism, materialism, causation, and necessitarianism. By studying the natural world, he argued, people would learn how to become more compassionate, happy, and prosperous.|$|E
5|$|Python is {{a widely}} used {{high-level}} programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design <b>philosophy</b> <b>that</b> emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.|$|E

5|$|In Aristotle's (384–322BC) {{description}} of the universe, the Moon marked {{the boundary between the}} spheres of the mutable elements (earth, water, air and fire), and the imperishable stars of aether, an influential <b>philosophy</b> <b>that</b> would dominate for centuries. However, in the , Seleucus of Seleucia correctly theorized that tides were due to the attraction of the Moon, and that their height depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun. In the same century, Aristarchus computed the size and distance of the Moon from Earth, obtaining a value of about twenty times the radius of Earth for the distance. These figures were greatly improved by Ptolemy (90–168AD): his values of a mean distance of 59times Earth's radius and a diameter of 0.292Earth diameters were close to the correct values of about 60 and 0.273 respectively. Archimedes (287–212 BC) designed a planetarium that could calculate the motions of the Moon and other objects in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Knox's {{death was}} barely noticed at the time. Although his funeral was {{attended}} by the nobles of Scotland, no major politician or diplomat mentioned his death in their letters that survive. Mary, Queen of Scots made only two brief references to him in her letters. However, what the rulers feared were Knox's ideas more than Knox himself. He was a ruthless and successful revolutionary {{and it was this}} revolutionary <b>philosophy</b> <b>that</b> had a great impact on the English Puritans. Despite his strictness and dogmatism, he has also been described by partisans as contributing to the struggle for genuine human freedom, by teaching a duty to oppose unjust government in order to bring about moral and spiritual change.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Maurice Friedman {{writes about}} the book {{in the context of}} the various {{attempts}} to find a universal essence - or perennial philosophy - within religion. He finds that Time and Eternity is a more systematic attempt at this than those proposed by Aldous Huxley or Ananda Coomaraswamy, but no more successful. For Friedman, the <b>philosophy</b> <b>that</b> Stace lays out in the book is derived from metaphysical speculation (that, like the ideas of Huxley and Coomaraswamy, is influenced by Vedanta), rather than mystical experience. Central to Friedman’s critique is the notion that there is a vast gulf between the mystical experience which Stace defines as beyond thought, and his philosophical system built on this. He also mentions that mystics do not always agree on what experiences, symbols and philosophies are the closest to the divine.|$|E

5|$|Tensions {{between the}} older {{citizens}} of the Most Holy Redeemer Parish and the gays entering the Castro District were growing, however, and in 1973, when two gay men tried to open an antique shop, the Eureka Valley Merchants Association (EVMA) attempted {{to prevent them from}} receiving a business license. Milk and a few other gay business owners founded the Castro Village Association, with Milk as the president. He often repeated his <b>philosophy</b> <b>that</b> gays should buy from gay businesses. Milk organized the Castro Street Fair in 1974 to attract more customers to the area. More than 5,000 attended, and some of the EVMA members were stunned; they did more business at the Castro Street Fair than on any previous day.|$|E
5|$|The worst {{loss of life}} in United States history due to a {{wildfire}} {{occurred in}} 1871 when the Peshtigo Fire swept through Wisconsin, killing more than 1500 people. The Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889 in California and especially the Great Fire of 1910 in Montana and Idaho contributed to the <b>philosophy</b> <b>that</b> fire was a danger {{that needed to be}} suppressed. The Great Fire of 1910 burned , destroyed a number of communities and killed 86 people, and this event prompted various land management agencies to emphasize wildfire suppression. U.S. Government land agencies, including the National Park Service, generally followed the fire management policies established by the U.S. Forest Service, which oversees the majority of the nation's forestlands.|$|E
5|$|During the High Middle Ages, {{which began}} after 1000, the {{population}} of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the Medieval Warm Period climate change allowed crop yields to increase. Manorialism, the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles, and feudalism, the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords {{in return for the}} right to rent from lands and manors, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages. The Crusades, first preached in 1095, were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims. Kings became the heads of centralised nation states, reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified Christendom more distant. Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism, a <b>philosophy</b> <b>that</b> emphasised joining faith to reason, and by the founding of universities. The theology of Thomas Aquinas, the paintings of Giotto, the poetry of Dante and Chaucer, the travels of Marco Polo, and the Gothic architecture of cathedrals such as Chartres are among the outstanding achievements toward the end of this period and into the Late Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|Kakashi's {{background}} is explored in Kakashi Gaiden, a six chapter series that divides {{the gap between}} Part I and II of the manga. Following his father's suicide, Sakumo Hatake aka the White Fang, Kakashi adopted the <b>philosophy</b> <b>that</b> {{the success of a}} mission must always come first rather than comrades in contrast to his father. Kakashi is assigned by his teacher, Minato Namikaze, to lead a mission that would turn the current war in Konoha's favor. When his teammate, Rin Nohara, is captured by enemy ninja, his other teammate, Obito Uchiha, convinces him to rescue her despite the mission's ending. After finding Rin, an enemy-induced cave-in crushed Obito's right half. With his dying wish and the possibility of enemy reinforcements, Obito has Rin implant his newly acquired Sharingan into Kakashi's recently damaged eye socket as a parting gift. His new eye in place, Kakashi flees with Rin as the cave collapsed, eventually completing their mission. Shortly after this event, Kakashi has to rescue Rin again who is kidnapped by Kirigakure; however, he learns that the Kiri, under the influence of Madara Uchiha, has made Rin as the host of the Three Tails, Isobu. Rin requests Kakashi to kill her so she may not be used by the Hidden Mist ninja as part of a Trojan Horse scheme against Konoha, but Kakashi is reluctant. She eventually forces herself on the way of Kakashi's Lightning Blade that he originally directed at the pursuing Hidden Mist ninja, killing her. An anime exclusive flashback arc in Naruto Shippuden covered Kakashi coping with what he endured during the war as he becomes an ANBU operative during Minato's time as Hokage and influences Yamato into becoming a member of the ANBU as well. Once relieved of duty in the ANBU, Kakashi becomes a Genin instructor prior to the events of Part I.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{refined and}} expanded from the version they used in Awakening. The My Castle feature was suggested by Maeda {{as an alternative}} activity for players, {{and to provide a}} means for getting to know the main characters outside battle. The amount of content included in the feature made some staff comment that it could be its own game. The social elements of My Castle were originally going to be exclusive to StreetPass, but it was suggested that players in areas with low StreetPass activity should be able to access the functions through a normal Internet connection. Some ideas thought up by Maeda for earlier titles, such as the Dragon Vein ability and the way skills were inherited by second generation characters, were also implemented. Due to the necessity for multiple versions, map designing became a larger task than anticipated, with very few maps being shared between versions. The Phoenix Mode was included to bring new fans into the series, a <b>philosophy</b> <b>that</b> they had neglected up until Awakening and improved for Fates. For {{the first time in the}} Fire Emblem series, the option for the main character to marry a character of the same sex was included: the potential male and female partners respectively appear in Conquest and Birthright, and both appear in Revelation. According to Nintendo, this move was done to reflect the diversity of their player base.|$|E

The Didact and humans are held prisoner, but Bornstellar is returned {{to the care of}} his father because of his family's status and power. On his family's home world, he uses the time and peace to reflect on recent events, and allow the imprint of the Didact to fully assimilate into his thoughts. He overhears an argument between his father and another Builder, from which he learns that his father was one of the chief builders of the Halos. The Didact opposed the Builders' decision to construct such a weapon, hence his exile. It is soon revealed that the Master Builder is being brought up on charges and that the Halo weapons had been recalled, but one of the rings had gone missing. Bornstellar is called to a Forerunner core planet to testify against the Master Builder, who has been put on trial for crimes against The Mantle, a Forerunner <b>philosophy</b> <b>that</b> values the preservation of life over all else. Just as the trial is about to begin, an AI, Mendicant Bias, betrays the Forerunners and intends to use the combined power of the Halos to begin wiping out the Forerunner race.|$|E
