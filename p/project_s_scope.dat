40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{handbook}} is to provide Earned Value Management (EVM) guidance for the effective application, implementation, and utilization of EVM on NASA programs, projects, major contracts and subcontracts in a consolidated reference document. EVM is a project management process that effectively integrates a <b>project</b> <b>s</b> <b>scope</b> of work with schedule and cost elements for optimum project planning and control. The goal is to achieve timely and accurate quantification of progress that will facilitate management by exception and enable early visibility into the nature and the magnitude of technical problems {{as well as the}} intended course and success of corrective actions...|$|E
40|$|Robots {{that operate}} {{independently}} {{of one another}} will not be adequate to accomplish the future exploration tasks of long-distance autonomous navigation, habitat construction, resource discovery, and material handling. Such activities will require that systems widely share information, plan and divide complex tasks, share common resources, and physically cooperate to manipulate objects. Recognizing the need for interoperable robots to accomplish the new exploration initiative, NASA s Office of Exploration Systems Research & Technology recently funded the development of the Joint Technical Architecture for Robotic Systems (JTARS). JTARS charter is to identify the interface standards necessary to achieve interoperability among space robots. A JTARS working group (JTARS-WG) has been established comprising recognized leaders in the field of space robotics including representatives from seven NASA centers along with academia and private industry. The working group s early accomplishments include addressing key issues required for interoperability, defining which systems are within the <b>project</b> <b>s</b> <b>scope,</b> and framing the JTARS manuals around classes of robotic systems...|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{designed}} to {{study the effects of}} home-school communication on parent involvement by implementing the program <b>Project</b> <b>S.</b> P. E. A. K. : Students, Parents, and Educators Actively Keeping in Touch. The targeted population consisted of 24 certified general education teachers and 505 parents of students in kindergarten through Grade 5. The issue in this study is that parents and teachers were not communicating well with each other. At the targeted site, parent involvement and attendance at school functions had dropped drastically over the past five years. The data that was collected from the surveys suggested that poor home and school communication had an effect on the number of parents {{who were involved in the}} school. <b>Project</b> <b>S.</b> P. E. A. K. {{was designed}} to improve communication between teachers and parents. <b>Project</b> <b>S.</b> P. E. A. K presented opportunities for all parents to become involved in their children 2 ̆ 7 s learning and school by organizing a <b>Project</b> <b>S.</b> P. E. A. K. student council, utilizing grade parents more efficiently, recognizing stakeholders for their effort to increase parent involvement, and involving parents, students and teachers in the efforts to increase parent involvement. An analysis of the data revealed that the <b>Project</b> <b>S.</b> P. E. A. K. initiative produced significant changes in behavior at the targeted site. This study also gives reference to school social workers and how they aid in the process of facilitating home-school communication. This study also gives implications for school social work practice, with recommendations for educators and recommendations for future research...|$|R
