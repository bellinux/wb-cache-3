25|$|In 1971, after a tragedy, the Marine Spa was {{demolished}} to {{make way}} for the ill-fated Coral Island leisure complex. This was characterised by its concrete arches on its uppermost floor and sunbathing decks like those of a cruise liner. The site featured a hexagonal outdoor plunge pool surrounded by sunbathing terraces leading down to Beacon Cove beach. Inside the building were several lounges, a restaurant and a nightclub within the arches of the ancient swimming bath. All levels were served by a hydraulic <b>passenger</b> <b>lift.</b> Coral Island opened in 1977 and closed in 1988. The complex was demolished in 1997, 20 years after its construction. The site remained derelict until 2002 when the Living Coasts coastal zoo was built there.|$|E
500|$|Production of the 757 {{peaked at}} an annual rate of 100 {{aircraft}} in the early 1990s, during which time upgraded models came under consideration. For over a decade, the narrow-body twinjet had been its manufacturer's only single-aisle airliner without a stretched variant, and while rumors of a long-range [...] and stretched [...] persisted, no formal announcements had been made. European charter carriers were particularly interested in a higher-capacity version which could take better advantage of the 757's range. Besides meeting the needs of charter customers, a larger model would enable Boeing to match the <b>passenger</b> <b>lift</b> capabilities of the [...] with lower operating costs, and counter longer-range versions of the 185-seat Airbus A321, a new stretched variant of the A320 narrow-body airliner.|$|E
500|$|Described as [...] "beautiful" [...] and [...] "intimidating" [...] by {{architect}} Christopher Lee of Populous, the Emirates Stadium is a four-tiered {{bowl with}} translucent polycarbonate roofing over the stands, but not over the pitch. The underside is clad with metallic panels and {{the roof is}} supported by four triangular trusses, made of welded tubular steel. Two trusses span [...] in a north–south direction while a further two span an east–west direction. The trusses are supported by the stadium's vertical concrete cores, eight of which connected to them by steel tripods. They in turn each house four stairways, a <b>passenger</b> <b>lift</b> as well as service access. Façades are either glazed or woven between the cores which allows visitors on the podium to see inside the stadium. The glass and steel construction was devised by Populous to give an impression that the stadium sparkles in sunlight and glows in the night.|$|E

2500|$|... $175,000 was budgeted for the fitout of the {{basketball}} court, and included such things as improved lighting, car park access, and funding for a <b>passenger</b> <b>lift</b> to allow for disabled patrons. Since the location was {{some distance from the}} town centre, a free shuttle bus was provided from Highbury once a week. This location {{was meant to be a}} transitional arrangement while the new building was being constructed. However, in the event, the library remained at this temporary location for four years.|$|E
2500|$|There are 29 {{double-deck}} passenger elevators, {{but there}} are different sets that service certain floors of the towers, specifically two sets of six of these double-deck passenger elevators to floors 1–23 and 1–37 respectively. [...] Another set of 5 passenger lifts transport passengers to the 41st and 42nd floors where they can switch lifts to reach the upper zones of the buildings, each double-deck <b>passenger</b> <b>lift</b> with the capacity of 52 passengers or, 26 passengers per deck.

2500|$|When {{the mall}} {{originally}} opened in 1973, {{it consisted of}} two floors. Its anchors consisted of Steinberg, Miracle Mart, The Bay and Eaton's. In the 1980s, the mall underwent an extensive renovation, including {{the addition of a}} third storey, upgraded <b>passenger</b> <b>lift,</b> and an escalator going directly from the ground floor to the top level. [...] The colour scheme was also changed to a green and tan marble design. [...] The original wrought-iron and wood railings were replaced by glass panels. [...] The new design featured large peaked glass panels as the ceiling. Another level was added to the exterior parkade as well.|$|E
2500|$|The Norfolk Hotel (currently branded as the Mercure Brighton Seafront Hotel, and {{previously}} as the Ramada Jarvis Hotel Brighton and other names) is a 4-star {{hotel in the}} seaside resort of Brighton, part of the English city of Brighton and Hove. [...] Designed in 1865 by architect Horatio Nelson Goulty, it replaced an earlier building called the Norfolk Inn {{and is one of}} several large Victorian hotels along the seafront. [...] The French Renaissance Revival-style building, recalling E.M. Barry's major London hotels, is [...] "tall, to make a show": the development of the <b>passenger</b> <b>lift</b> a few years earlier allowed larger hotels to be built. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
2500|$|The 1860s {{was a time}} of {{innovation}} in hotel building and architecture. By the mid-19th century, staying in hotels had become much more popular than renting a large house for several months, which had been the norm for Brighton's wealthy visitors over the previous century. [...] The Royal Albion and (original) Bedford Hotels of the 1820s were smaller-scale early examples, but only with the development of the <b>passenger</b> <b>lift</b> could they be built on a grand scale. One of Britain's first lifts—a water-powered [...] "ascending omnibus", as it was called—was fitted in the newly built Grand Hotel on Kings Road in 1864. The following year, the Norfolk Arms was completely rebuilt, retaining nothing of its original form. [...] Architect Horatio Nelson Goulty was commissioned for the job; an important figure in public life in Brighton, {{he was one of the}} founders of the Extra Mural Cemetery in 1850 and later in the 1860s designed Congregational churches in Newhaven and Hove. Goulty designed the building (now solely a hotel rather than an inn, and renamed the Norfolk Hotel accordingly) in a similar style to the Grand, albeit [...] "slightly more florid". The author of Moorecroft's Guide (1866), a guidebook about the resort, called the rebuilt hotel [...] "more beautiful than any other building in Brighton" [...] despite offering mild criticism of the Grand's very similar architecture. As originally built, the Norfolk was much smaller than the Grand, with 64 bedrooms arranged over five floors compared to the latter's 150 bedrooms and eight storeys. Nevertheless, it was one of the major hotels of Victorian-era Brighton, which is [...] "one of the few places in Britain where ... grand hotels of the European model can be seen". Along with the Grand and the nearby Metropole (1890), it was one of the [...] "great show hotels on the front", at which only wealthy visitors would have stayed; the thousands of working-class holidaymakers would have used the poorer lodging-houses in less favourable locations.|$|E

50|$|Sample {{rooms were}} {{provided}} in the hotel, and stabling accommodation was available. The main staircase of the hotel was designed to enable the subsequent installation of a <b>passenger</b> <b>lift,</b> however {{there is no evidence}} to indicate that this ever occurred. The article also indicated that the walls of the hotel had been built of such a thickness that two additional stories could be added at any time which indicates a possible reason for the provision for a <b>passenger</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E
