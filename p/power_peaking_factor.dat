40|$|A new {{formulation}} {{of a nuclear}} core design optimization problem is introduced in this article. Originally, the optimization problem consisted in adjusting several reactor cell parameters, such as dimensions, enrichment and materials, {{in order to minimize}} the radial <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> <b>factor</b> in a three-enrichment zone reactor, considering restrictions on the average thermal flux, criticality and sub-moderation. Here, we address the same problem using the minimization of the fuel and cladding materials costs as the objective function, and the radial <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> <b>factor</b> as an operational constraint. This cost-based optimization problem is attacked by two metaheuristics, the standard genetic algorithm (SGA), and a recently introduced Metropolis algorithm called the Particle Collision Algorithm (PCA). The two algorithms are submitted to the same computational effort and their results are compared. As the formulation presented is preliminary, more elaborate models are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, fuel {{assembly}} bow in Ringhals 3 {{has started to}} increase again after lower levels of bow. Normally, the fuel assemblies are straight axially. One {{of the consequences of}} {{fuel assembly}} bow is perturbed power distribution across the core, resulting in smaller margins of safety during operation. A way of ensuring safe operation is add-on margins, penalties, dependent on bow amplitude, added to the power peaking factors. A new method of producing these penalties, based on realistic water gap distribution derived from measurements, was used. By comparing the new penalties with the currently used penalties, the currently used penalties were concluded to be around 10 percent smaller for both FdH, the radial <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> <b>factor</b> penalty, and FQ, the local <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> <b>factor</b> penalty. The currently used penalties hence are significantly lower. However, the conclusion should be seen as an indication, rather than directly implementable, since there is potential to evolve the method further and eliminate sources of error...|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{strategies}} yet implemented to optimize fuel loading pattern design in the nuclear power reactors, are based on maximizing the core effective multiplication factor (Keff) in order to extract maximum energy and to reduce the local <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> <b>factor</b> (Pq) from a set value.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that an intense neutron source {{can be produced}} in a suitable target by spallation neutrons generated by a high-current high-energy proton beam. Typical beam energy for such an accelerator is 400 to 2000 MeV. A conventional critical reactor can readily {{be replaced by a}} ''sub-critical reactor'' driven by this source. A 5 MW proton beam at 600 MeV can drive a sub-critical reactor to 100 MWt. The accelerator and the associated plant support equipment at these design specifications are complex systems, but they are well within recent technology. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine core design and shielding design issues for a 100 MWt sodium-cooled fast-spectrum Sub-Critical Multiplier (SCM- 100) based on LMFBR technology, but driven by an intense neutron source created by spallation reactions. SCM- 100 is a component of the Accelerator Driven Test Facility. In this report we provide an overview of the SCM- 100 concept. Two designs were investigated: (1) a vertical entry for the beam on the axial centerline; and (2) an inclined entry design where the core is ''C'' shaped and the beam enters the side of the target at an angle of 32 degrees. A brief overview of relevant shielding design data from EBR-II is also provided. The key result of this report is that the inclined entry design cannot achieve design objectives for radial power peaking. Consequently it cannot achieve design objectives for peak neutron flux. Axial power peaking factors are controlled by the axial fuel height and the axial reflector properties. These dimensions and compositions are very similar in SCM- 100 to those of EBR-II. EBR-II had an axial <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> <b>factor</b> of 1. 093, and a radial <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> <b>factor</b> of about 1. 46. The radial power peaking of SCM- 100 with the inclined entry is too extreme at 2. 15, and cannot be made acceptable by modifying the size and detailed shape of the ''C'' shaped core and reflector. The axial power peaking of SCM- 100 is very close to that of EBR-II. Although these conclusions were obtained using EBR-II Mark-IIIA fuel elements of a single enrichment, they are expected to be true for any single-enrichment fuel design with a similar active fuel height and similar k-infinity. Shielding of the grid plate was also investigated. The lower axial reflector thickness necessary to achieve the design lifetime was found to be 75 cm...|$|E
40|$|The I 2 S-LWR is an {{innovative}} {{nuclear power plant}} design with the power level and size of conventional large LWRs. While other new reactor designs use exotic coolants or are very small in size with unconfirmed claims of scalability, the I 2 S-LWR design promises safer operating and shutdown features in a package with proven economic power level. The research in this thesis analyzes the I 2 S-LWR core design using 2 D and 3 D Serpent models. Work completed using the 2 D model is used to verify the accuracy of uncertainties reported by Serpent and provide guidance for moving forward with the 3 D design. Serpent-reported uncertainties are compared to observed uncertainties from replica runs and also symmetric groupings. In moving toward creating a 3 D model, the 2 D model results are compared with an industry code. Knowledge derived from these endeavors is implemented in the 3 D model through results and observations. The 3 D model and depletion methodology is the principal focus of this thesis. It is described in detail and its depletion of a first core using a candidate core loading pattern is evaluated based on power performance. The depletion analysis uses temperature feedback for the fuel, IFBA, and coolant as well as density variation for the coolant. For a design using only four fuel enrichments, the achieved <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> <b>factors</b> are better than expected at the quarter assembly level: FdH stays below 1. 25, Fz stays below 1. 45, and Fq stays below 1. 7 for the entire fuel cycle.

40|$|Many {{desirable}} {{locations for}} Pebble Bed Modular Reactors are currently out of consideration as construction sites for current designs due to {{limitations on the}} mode of transportation for large RPVs. In particular, the PBMR- 400 design developed by PBMR Pty of South Africa uses an RPV with an outer diameter of 6. 4 meters. Since current SCHNABEL railcars can only haul components up to 4. 3 meters wide, the only other possibility for transport is by barge, which limits construction to sites accessible by river, lake or coast. Designing a PBMR with a core able to fit within an RPV able to be transported by railcar would be extremely valuable, especially for potential inland sites only accessible by railway, {{such as those in}} the Canadian Oil Sands at which the PBMR would be utilized for oil extraction processes. Therefore, a study was conducted to determine the feasibility of a Pebble Bed Modular Reactor design operating at 250 MWth with a core restricted to fitting inside an RPV with an outer diameter of 4. 3 meters. After reviewing the performance of various core configurations satisfying this constraint, an optimized PBMR design operating at this power was found. This new design uses the same fuel management scheme as the PBMR 400, as well as similar inlet and outlet coolant temperatures. This MPBR- 250 design includes a pebble bed with an outer diameter of 2. 7 meters, an outer reflector 50 cm thick and 12. 5 % enriched fuel. A mixture of graphite pebbles of 11. 7 % is also included in the pebble bed to produce an equilibrium core with minimal excess reactivity. (cont.) This thesis shows that the MPBR- 250 can perform up to the standards of the PBMR- 400 design with respect to <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> <b>factors,</b> peak temperatures and RPV fast fluences and can also increase fuel burnup to nearly 110 GWd/T. In addition, the MPBR- 250 is a much more agile design, able to be deployed at a wider variety of locations because its RPV can be transported by railcar. by Matthew S. Everson. Thesis (S. M. and S.

40|$|The MIT Research Reactor (MITR) is in {{the process}} of {{conducting}} a design study to convert from High Enrichment Uranium (HEU) fuel to Low Enrichment Uranium (LEU) fuel. The currently selected LEU fuel design contains 18 plates per element, compared to the existing HEU design of 15 plates per element. A transitional conversion strategy, which consists of replacing three HEU elements with fresh LEU fuel elements in each fuel cycle, is proposed. The objective of this thesis is to analyze the thermo-hydraulic safety margins and to determine the operating power limits of the MITR for each mixed core configuration. The analysis was performed using PLTEMP/ANL ver 3. 5, a program developed for thermo-hydraulic calculations of research reactors. Two correlations were used to model the friction pressure drop and enhanced heat transfer of the finned fuel plates: the Carnavos correlation for friction factor and heat transfer, and the Wong Correlation for friction factor with a constant heat transfer enhancement factor of 1. 9. With these correlations, the minimum onset of nucleate boiling (ONB) margins of the hottest fuel plates were evaluated in nine different core configurations, the HEU core, the LEU core and seven mixed cores that consist of both HEU and LEU elements. The maximum radial <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> <b>factors</b> were assumed at 2. 0 for HEU and 1. 76 for LEU in all the analyzed core configurations. The calculated results indicate that the HEU fuel elements yielded lower ONB margins than LEU fuel elements in all mixed core configurations. In addition to full coolant channels, side channels next to the support plates that form side coolant channels were analyzed and found to be more limiting due to higher flow resistance. The maximum operating powers during the HEU to LEU transition were determined by maintaining the minimum ONB margin corresponding to the homogeneous HEU core at 6 MW. The recommended steady-state power is 5. 8 MW for all transitional cores if the maximum radial peaking is adjacent to a full coolant channel and 4. 9 MW if the maximum radial peaking is adjacent to a side coolant channel.

40|$|A new reactor burn-up {{strategy}} CANDLE was proposed, where {{shapes of}} neutron flux, nuclide densities and power density distributions remain constant but move to an axial direction. Here important points {{are that the}} solid fuel is fixed at each position and that any movable burn-up reactivity control mechanisms such as control rods are not required. This burn-up strategy can derive many merits. The change of excess reactivity along burn-up is theoretically zero, and shim rods will not be required for this reactor. The reactor becomes free from accidents induced by unexpected control rods withdrawal during power operation. The core characteristics, such as power feedback coefficients and <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> <b>factor,</b> are not changed along burn-up.

This work utilizes one such developed technique of optimization called simulated annealing to produce optimal operation parameters for a 15 x 15 fuel assembly {{to be used in}} an operating nuclear power reactor.

Both of these optimizations can be performed by coupling Adaptive Simulated Annealing to TransLAT which successfully searches the optimization space for a fuel assembly layout that produces the minimized pin <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> <b>factor.</b> Within given time constraints this package produces optimal layouts within a given set of assumptions and constraints.

40|$|Pursuant to a 1986 NRC ruling, the MIT Reactor (MITR) is {{planning}} on converting {{from the use}} of highly enriched uranium (HEU) to low enriched uranium (LEU) for fuel. Prior {{studies have shown that the}} MITR will be able to operate using monolithic U-Mo LEU fuel while achieving neutron fluxes close to that of an HEU core. However, to date, detailed studies on fuel management and burnup while using LEU fuel have not been performed. In this work, a code package is developed for performing detailed fuel management studies at the MITR that is easy to use and is based on state-of-the-art computational methodologies. A wrapper was written that enables fuel management operations to be modeled using MCODE, a code developed at MIT that couples MCNP to the point-depletion code ORIGEN. To explicitly model the movement of the control blades in the MITR as the core is being depleted, a criticality search algorithm was implemented to determine the critical position of the control blades at each depletion timestep. Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to automate the creation of model input files. The fuel management wrapper and GUI were developed in Python, with the PyQt 4 extension being used for GUI-specific features. The MCODE fuel management wrapper has been shown to perform reliably based on a number of studies. An LEU equilibrium core was modeled and burned for 640 days with the fuel being moved in the same pattern every 80 days. The control blade movement and nuclide concentrations were shown to be in agreement with what one would intuitively predict. The fuel management capabilities of REBUS-PC and the MCODE fuel management wrapper were compared by modeling the same refueling scheme using an HEU core. The element <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> <b>factors</b> for the two models showed remarkable agreement. Together, the fuel management wrapper and graphical user interface will help the staff at the MITR perform in-core fuel management calculations quickly and with a higher level of detail than that previously possible. by Paul K.

This is {{much larger than the}} uncertainty in most parameters that are calculated with best-estimate methods for other design-basis events...|$|R
40|$|A {{heterogeneous}} LWR core design, {{which employs}} a thorium/uranium once through fuel cycle, is optimized for good economics, wide safety margins, minimal waste burden and high proliferation resistance. The {{focus is on}} the Whole Assembly Seed and Blanket (WASB) concept, in which the individual seed and blanket regions each occupy one full-size PWR assembly in a checkerboard core configuration. A Westinghouse 4 -loop 1150 MWe PWR was selected as the reference plant design. The optimized heterogeneous core, after several iterations, employs 84 seed assemblies and 109 blanket assemblies. Each assembly has the characteristic 17 x 17 rod array. The seed fuel is composed of 20 w/o enriched annular UO 2 pellets. Erbium is used in the fresh seed to help regulate local <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> and reduce soluble boron concentrations. Erbium was evenly distributed into all pin central holes except for the peripheral pins and four corner pins of each assembly where more erbium was used due to their higher power level. The blanket fuel is a mixture of 87 % ThO 2 - 13 % UO 2 by volume, where the uranium is enriched to 10 w/o. The blanket fuel pin diameter is larger than the seed fuel pin diameter. There are two separate fuel management flows: a standard three-batch scheme is adopted for the seed (18 month cycle length) and a single-batch for the blanket, which is to stay in the core for up to 9 seed cycles. The WASB core design was analyzed by well known tools in the nuclear industry. The neutronic analysis was performed using the Studsvik Core Management System (CMS), which consists of three codes: CASMO- 4, TABLES- 3 and SIMULATE- 3. Thermal-hydraulic analysis was performed using EPRI's VIPRE- 01. (cont.) Fuel performance was analyzed using FRAPCON. The radioactivity and decay heat from the spent seed and blanket fuel were studied using MIT's MCODE (which couples MCNP and ORIGEN) to do depletion calculations, and ORIGEN to analyze the spent fuel characteristics after discharge. The analyses show that the WASB core can satisfy the requirements of fuel cycle length and safety margins of conventional PWRs. The coefficients of reactivity are comparable to currently operating PWRs. However, the reduction in effective delayed neutron fraction (eff) requires careful review of the control systems because of its importance to short term power transients. Whole core analyses show that the total control rod worth of the WASB core is about 1 / 3 less than those of a typical PWR for a standard arrangement of Ag-In-Cd control rods in the core. The use of enriched boron in the control rods can effectively improve the control rod worth. The control rods have higher worth in the seed than in the blanket. Therefore, a new loading pattern has been designed so that almost all the control rods will be located in seed assemblies. However, the new pattern requires a redesign of the vessel head of the reactor, which is an added cost in case of retrofitting in existing PWRs. Though the WASB core has high <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> <b>factors,</b> acceptable MDNBR in the core can be achieved under conservative assumptions by using grids with large local pressure loss coefficient in the blanket. However, the core pressure drop will increase by 70 % [...] . by Dean Wang. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Nuclear Engineering, 2003.

40|$|In this paper, {{three types}} of {{operational}} and industrial absorbers used at research reactors, including Ag-In-Cd alloy, B 4 C, and Hf are selected for sensitivity analyses. Their integral effects on the main neutronic core parameters important to safety issues are investigated. These parameters are core excess reactivity, shutdown margin, total reactivity worth of control rods, thermal neutron flux, power density distribution, and <b>Power</b> <b>Peaking</b> <b>Factor</b> (PPF). The IAEA 10 MW benchmark core is selected as the case study to verify calculations. A two-dimensional, three-group diffusion model is selected for core calculations. The well-known WIMS-D 4 and CITATION reactor codes are used to carry out these calculations. It is found that the largest shutdown margin is gained using the B 4 C; also the lowest PPF is gained using the Ag-In-Cd alloy. The maximum point power densities belong to the inside fuel regions surrounding the central flux trap (irradiation position), surrounded by control fuel elements, and the peripheral fuel elements beside the graphite reflectors. The greatest and least fluctuation of the point power densities are gained by using B 4 C and Ag-In-Cd alloy, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} CPU time {{required}} for a typical fuel lattice calculation is considerable; even more if this type of calculations is attempted for carrying out an exhaustive exploration of a search space in a combinatorial optimization problem. This situation has motivated {{to look at the}} possibility of replacing the best estimate HELIOS code by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), in order to predict the major Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) fuel lattice parameters. In this paper the development of an Artificial Neural Network and some results obtained during the training process and application of the ANN are presented. The obtained ANN is used to predict the maximum local <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> <b>factor</b> (LPPF) in a typical 10 x 10 BWR fuel lattice. The LPPF is predicted at beginning of life (0. 0 MWD/T), at 40 % voids moderator density, fuel temperature of 793 ºK, and moderator temperature of 560 ºK. The axial location of the fuel lattice is just above the natural uranium zone, called the power lattice, {{at the bottom of the}} reactor core. Finally the trained Artificial Neural Network is applied in order to predict the LPPF of some BWR fuel lattices, which have been used in the real operation of the Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant (LVNNP) in Mexico...|$|E
40|$|An {{optimization}} procedure {{based on}} the Genetic Algorithms method was developed for the optimization of enrichment and gadolinia distributions in boiling water reactor fuel lattices. The optimization process {{was linked to the}} HELIOS code to evaluate and qualify all the investigated solutions. The goal is to search for the optimal fuel lattice distribution, which has the lowest average enrichment between two defined values, and the minimum local power peaking factor; which satisfies an average gadolinia concentration target and a k-infinite multiplication factor, also target. The weighting factors, used to give the relative importance of the evaluation parameters in the objective function, take two different values depending on the values of the evaluation parameters. This strategy helped the process to rapidly guide the search toward configurations which satisfy all the constraints. The genetic algorithm uses one crossover point, and two offspring. The main contribution of this work is the development of an efficient procedure for BWR fuel lattice design, using a powerful algorithm and an objective function which saves computing time, because it does not require lattice burnup calculations. The results show the good performance of this procedure; fuel distributions were found with low enrichment, low radial <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> <b>factor</b> and good reactivity performance during the lattice life...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} the impacts of <b>peaking</b> <b>factors</b> on a water {{distribution}} system designed for a small city in Germany through model-based analysis. As a case study, the water distribution network was modelled by EPANET and then two specific studies were carried out. The first study tested corresponding system-wide influences on water age and energy consumption if the <b>peaking</b> <b>factors</b> used at design stage are inconsistent with ones in real situation. The second study inspected the possible relationship between the choice of <b>peaking</b> <b>factors</b> and budgets by comparing several different pipe configurations of the distribution system, obtained according to variety of <b>peaking</b> <b>factors.</b> Given the analysis results, the first study reveals that average water age will increase if <b>peaking</b> <b>factors</b> estimated at design stage are larger than real values in that specific system, and vice versa. In contrast, energy consumption will increase if <b>peaking</b> <b>factors</b> defined for system design are smaller than ones in real case, and vice versa. According to the second study, {{it might be possible}} to amplify <b>peaking</b> <b>factors</b> for design dramatically by a slight increase in the investment on this system. However, further study on budget estimation with more factors and detailed information considered should be carried out...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} poloidal {{asymmetry}} of impurities on impurity transport driven by electrostatic turbulence in tokamak plasmas is analyzed. It is {{found that in}} the presence of in-out asymmetric impurity populations the zero-flux impurity density gradient (the so-called <b>peaking</b> <b>factor)</b> is significantly reduced. A sign change in the impurity flux may occur if the asymmetry is sufficiently large. This may be a contributing reason for the observed outward convection of impurities {{in the presence of}} radio frequency heating. The effect of in-out asymmetry is most significant in regions with low temperature gradients. In the trapped electron mode dominated case also an up-down asymmetry can lead to a sign change in the <b>peaking</b> <b>factor</b> from positive to negative. The effect of ion parallel compressibility on the <b>peaking</b> <b>factor</b> is significant, and leads to positive <b>peaking</b> <b>factors</b> in regions with high temperature gradients, even in the presence of in-out asymmetry.
