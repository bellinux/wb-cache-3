5|$|Abovian saw in {{strengthening}} of the friendship of Russian and Armenian peoples a guarantee of the national, political and cultural revival of his native lands. However; when Abovian wrote the novel he was already disillusioned with Tsarist policies in Armenia, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> implementation of Polozhenie (Statute) in 1836 which greatly reduced {{the political power of}} the Armenian Catholicos and the abolishment of the Armenian Oblast in 1840. In the novel, elements of romanticism and realism are interlaced while the narration is supplanted by lyrical retreats.|$|E
5|$|Ace, {{along with}} Ballantine Books, {{was one of}} the leading science fiction {{publishers}} for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, Donald A. Wollheim and Terry Carr, left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to Grosset & Dunlap. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> third Ace Science Fiction Specials series, for which Carr was the editor. Further mergers and acquisitions resulted in the company becoming a part of Berkley Books. Ace then became an imprint of Penguin Group (USA).|$|E

5|$|Fuller, however, was {{confident}} {{in his work}} {{and the idea that}} the film would be strongly anti-racist, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> changes he had made to the original work. The original novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer, who had deliberately retrained the dog to attack white people, was converted into the character of Keys, who genuinely wished to cure the animal. Fuller also changed the novel's original ending into a more pessimistic film ending. The film was shot in only forty-five days at a cost of $7 million. Five white German Shepherd Dogs played the unnamed central character.|$|E
5|$|Goldschmidt {{was elected}} to the Portland City Council in 1970 and then as mayor of Portland in 1972, {{becoming}} the youngest mayor of any major American city. He promoted the revitalization of Downtown Portland and was influential on Portland-area transportation policy, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> abandonment of the Mount Hood Freeway and the establishment of the MAX Light Rail. He was appointed U.S. Secretary of Transportation by President Jimmy Carter in 1979; in that capacity he worked to revive the ailing automobile industry and to deregulate several industries. He served until the end of Carter's presidency in 1981 and then served as a senior executive with Nike for several years.|$|E
5|$|House of the Dead 4 Special (2006) {{featuring}} large screens enclosing the player, {{as well as}} swivelling, vibrating chairs. Some games {{attempted to}} incorporate elements of first person shooter or survival horror games {{through the use of}} less restricted character movement and exploration, with varying degrees of success. Others, however, unashamedly paid homage to 1990s arcade gameplay, even embracing a somewhat parodic style. Light guns are not compatible with modern high-definition televisions, leading developers to experiment with hybrid controllers, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wii Remote for the Wii, as well as the PlayStation 3's GunCon 3 peripheral used with Time Crisis 4. Others have used the PlayStation Move motion control system.|$|E

5|$|Lemur {{taxonomy}} is controversial, {{and not all}} experts agree, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> recent {{increase in}} the number of recognized species. According to Russell Mittermeier, the president of Conservation International (CI), taxonomist Colin Groves, and others, there are nearly 100recognized species or subspecies of extant (or living) lemur, divided into five families and 15genera. Because genetic data indicates that the recently extinct subfossil lemurs were closely related to living lemurs, an additional three families, eight genera, and 17species can be included in the total. In contrast, other experts have labeled this as taxonomic inflation, instead preferring a total closer to 50 species.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, in Middle English {{and early}} modern Scottish evidence, while still {{appearing}} as causes of harm and danger, elves appear clearly as human-like beings. They became associated with medieval chivalric romance traditions of fairies and <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{idea of a}} Fairy Queen. A propensity to seduce or rape people becomes increasingly prominent in the source material. Around the fifteenth century, evidence starts to appear for the belief that elves might steal human babies {{and replace them with}} changelings.|$|E
5|$|Miller had a light {{workload}} in the 1947–48 home Test {{series against}} India, which Australia won 4–0; his teammates often finished off the opposition {{before he had}} an opportunity, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bat. He was required to bat just once in each Test, accumulating 185runs at 37.00, including two half-centuries. His 72overs yielded nine wickets at 24.78. Lindwall and Miller were selected by captain Donald Bradman and his fellow selectors for the 1948 tour of England as the intended new ball pairing.|$|E

5|$|The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., premiered on the Fox network at 8:00pm on Friday, August 27, 1993, with {{a two-hour}} pilot movie. To bolster viewer {{interest}} in the show, Fox rebroadcast the pilot two days later at 7:00pm. Both airings of the pilot returned strong ratings. Brisco's ratings for the pilot and first episode were high, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> demographic of adults aged 18–49. The series was aired in Canada, including on Global Toronto (channel 29).|$|E
5|$|The Vlaams Blok {{maintained}} good {{contacts with}} nationalist parties throughout Europe and other countries. The Vlaams Blok did traditionally have the closest contacts with Dutch and South African far-right groups, including the Dutch Centre Party '86, the Centre Democrats and Voorpost, and the South African Boerestaat Party. In the mid-1980s, it also established close relations <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> French National Front, {{as well as}} the German People's Union, The Republicans and National Democratic Party of Germany. In the 1990s, it supported the minor Dutch Block party, which had modeled itself directly on the Vlaams Blok.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{skepticism}} in the West, the new Soviet leader {{proved to}} be committed to reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West. Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost, or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions. Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption {{at the top of the}} Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee. Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations.|$|E

5|$|Early Māori {{adapted the}} tropically based east Polynesian culture {{in line with}} the {{challenges}} associated with a larger and more diverse environment, eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social organisation was largely communal with families (whānau), subtribes (hapū) and tribes (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira), whose position was subject to the community's approval. The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> introduction of Christianity. However, Māori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity, and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples. More recently American, Australian, Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand. Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika, the world's largest Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{played a}} vital role in the side's success in the Test series, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ball. Despite a back injury which meant he passed one Test without bowling, he took 13 wickets in the series at an average of 26.28, and also contributed 184 runs at an average of 23.15. He {{played a key role in}} subduing England's leading batsmen, Len Hutton and Denis Compton, with a barrage of short-pitched bowling, troubling Hutton to such an extent that he was dropped for the Third Test. In all {{first-class}} matches on the tour, Miller scored 1,088 runs at 47.30 and took 56 wickets at 17.58. Bradman gave him a light bowling workload during the tour matches, to keep him fresh for the Test matches.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April, the British Admiral Henry Wood and the German Admiral Eugen Kalau vom Hofe {{began an}} {{inspection}} of the Ottoman fleet, which concluded that {{only a handful of}} ships were seaworthy, and as a result, should not be used offensively. Through April and May, the Ottoman fleet made several sorties into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to raise morale among the ships' crews, though the Ottomans had no intention of attacking Greek forces. On 15 May, Hamidiye and the ironclads Mesudiye, Necm-i Şevket, , and , along with several other vessels conducted a major training exercise under the supervision of von Hofe, where severe deficiencies in the level of training were revealed, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> men's ability to operate the ships' guns. In September 1897, the war came to an end, and the Ottoman fleet returned to Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|The Delichon species {{typically}} feed {{higher in}} the air, and take smaller prey than other swallows. It is believed that this reduces inter-specific food competition, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> barn swallow which shares much of the breeding and wintering range of the martins. The insects eaten are mostly small flies, aphids and Hymenoptera such as winged ants. A wide range of other insects are caught, including Lepidoptera, beetles and lacewings. The Asian house martin appears to occasionally take terrestrial springtails and larvae and the common house martin also sometimes feeds on the ground. These martins are gregarious, feeding in flocks often with other aerial predators like swifts, or other hirundines such as the barn or striated swallows. In the case of at least the common house martin, the start of egg laying appears {{to be linked to}} the appearance of large numbers of flying aphids, which provide a stable and abundant food supply.|$|E
5|$|The English {{enjoyed a}} marked superiority over the Scots in cavalry, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{resurgence}} of heavy cavalry with {{their use of}} demi-lancers. The feudal heavy cavalry had begun to disappear from Scottish armies after Bannockburn in 1314. It was limited by the shortage of suitable horses. James V imported great horses and mares from Denmark {{in an attempt to}} improve the quality of Scottish breading stock. In the mid-sixteenth century the Scots still lacked sufficient heavy cavalry. In their place they fielded relatively large numbers of light horse, often drawn from the Borders and usually wearing jacks of leather or mail, mounted on small horses and using light lances. As firearms became available they began to field relatively large numbers of mounted arquebusiers.|$|E
5|$|The film {{serves as}} a satire of the social conditions, {{dominant}} practices, and ideologies of Hollywood, {{as well as the}} film industry's perceived mistreatment of actors. Filmmaking was becoming more expensive and requiring larger technical resources, <b>particularly</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rise of sound production, making it increasingly difficult for amateur filmmakers to enter the profession. This deepened a divide between amateurs and Hollywood professionals, and as a result, a growing number of amateurs started lampooning Hollywood in their films, including A Hollywood Extra. The subject of the film is an extra who starts his Hollywood career with hopes and dreams, but ultimately finds himself used and discarded by the industry, and his artistic ambitions destroyed. At the start of the film, the protagonist has a name (Mr. Jones) and a letter of recommendation outlining his talents, but his abilities are ignored and he is reduced to a number, symbolizing his dehumanization.|$|E
