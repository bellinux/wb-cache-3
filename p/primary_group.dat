25|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>group</b> {{responsible}} for storm spotting in the U.S. {{is known as}} Skywarn. Many individuals hold Skywarn certification and/or amateur radio licenses. Other spotters are part of organized and highly trained local spotter groups, reporting their observations to the local emergency management office or National Weather Service office {{responsible for}} that area. A Skywarn group is {{either directly or indirectly}} affiliated or associated with the local weather office, and in many cases other agencies responsible for the well-being of individuals. Today, amateur radio still plays a key role, as most spotters opt to attain their radio licenses; however, cell phones are an ever increasingly popular means to directly relay information, along with other on-line spotter reporting protocols such as The Spotter Network.|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{theory suggests}} that <b>primary</b> <b>groups</b> among the dissatisfied participants in an organization tend to decrease the compliance of the participants. But the present study found in a Nationalist Chinese Air Police company that <b>primary</b> <b>groups</b> among the dissatisfied actually increase the compliance. An explanation of the conflicting finding will be discussed. The General Problem The significance of <b>primary</b> <b>groups</b> in organizational study is well known. The authors of The American Soldiers (1949) found in tactical units that the direct identification with the total symbols of the military organiza-tion as a whole, of the state, or of the political cause {{in the name of}} which a war was fought, was relatively unimportant as contrasted with the feelings of strength and security in the military <b>primary</b> <b>groups</b> and loyalty to one's immediate comrades. Such feelings contributed greatly to the combat effective-ness of individual soldiers (see also Shils, 1950; Goodacre 1951; Grinker and Spiegel, 1963; Oanowitz and Little, 1965). A positive relation between <b>primary</b> <b>groups</b> and organizational effectiveness has also been found in man...|$|R

500|$|A fission-fusion {{society is}} a society that changes {{frequently}} in its size and composition, making up a permanent social group called the [...] "parent group". Permanent social networks consist of all individual members of a community and often varies to track changes in their environment. In a fission–fusion society, the main parent group can fracture (fission) into smaller stable subgroups or individuals to adapt to environmental or social circumstances. For example, a number of males may break off from the main group in order to hunt or forage for food during the day, but at night they may return to join (fusion) the <b>primary</b> <b>group</b> to share food and partake in other activities. Many mammals exhibit this, such as primates (for example orangutans and spider monkeys), elephants, spotted hyenas, lions, and dolphins.|$|E

Organizers with BASTA began the recall process in August after unsuccessfully calling for the resignation of Mayor Oscar Hernandez and council members Luis Artiga, Teresa Jacobo and George Mirabal. Artiga has since resigned.|$|E
