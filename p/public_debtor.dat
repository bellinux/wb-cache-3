However, whoever the <b>public</b> <b>debtor</b> is, the latter will intervene more or less directly, increasingly becoming an interlocutor in any attempt to renegotiate or even totally pay the debt itself.

40|$|In {{the early}} modern period, the Low Countries {{performed}} {{a key role in}} trade and commerce on the European continent. In their golden ages, Antwerp in the sixteenth and Amsterdam in the seventeenth century attracted merchants from all over Europe and even beyond. The massive development of commerce and finance within this transregional reality raised new normative questions {{on how to deal with}} novel financial techniques. Most often, the answers were multifold. Different layers of normativity were at stake: apart from learned legal treatises and commentaries, also moral theological literature, princely or local ordinances, and customary law had to be taken into account. The Netherlandish published volumes of consilia and decisiones – together coined as ‘learned legal practice’ – form two types of legal sources which offer an excellent insight into the combined application of these different normative layers. In consilia, learned lawyers gave their opinion on specific disputes, either before or in the course of legal proceedings. Volumes of decisiones contain reports of decisions by the superior courts of the Low Countries. After an introduction into the sources and a short overview of the overall Ph. D. project, this paper will deal with the Netherlandish learned legal practice regarding the sale of annuities (emptio-venditio redituum), a common technique to circumvent the prohibition against usury. Someone in need of credit sold an annuity to a buyer-financier who in return paid a purchase price. As of the mid-sixteenth century learned authors accepted that the seller could unilaterally redeem the annuity, even though discussion remained as to the possibility of contractual clauses which temporarily limited that right. As this possibility was only guaranteed in case of pecuniarily constituted annuities, debates also concerned the burden of proof of an annuity’s emptitious nature. Furthermore, this contribution deals with the possibility by a <b>public</b> <b>debtor</b> to mitigate its own annual liabilities through the enactment of legislation. Finally, it is shown that the buyer-creditor was generally denied a right to claim restitution of the capital. status: accepte...|$|E

It examines in particular the epigraphic evidence pertaining to the alienation of public and sacred properties. Three different cases where public or sacred properties could be sold or offered as security are considered: the sale of land belonging to the gods, the sale of properties confiscated either from <b>public</b> <b>debtors</b> or as a consequence of exiles and political events and, finally, public properties as security in credit contracts. The second part concentrates on the Athenian Rationes Centesimarum, a set of inscriptions recording the operation of a massive sale of land and houses belonging to corporate groups between ca. 340 and 320 B.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{apparently}} ubiquitous relations of debt, {{it has been argued}} that the debtor possesses a unique, revolutionary potential.

40|$|The {{administration}} {{of a financial}} activities portfolio usually generates two categories of risks: the risk exposure and the market risk. The purpose is to present {{the evolution of the}} country risk of Romania through using the specific statistic indicators with the granted classification by the main rating agencies. The risk exposure is the result of credit activity to a <b>public</b> <b>debtor</b> (in this case, a country), this activity being applied by banks at international level. From this point of view, the analysis of the country risk must offer information on the base of which the banks can establish the upper limits of exposure to a country and can monitories as possible in real time, the exposure to the respective country. 	The market risk appears as a result of unfavorable changes that may appear in a country’s financial market and that may affect the performance of activities that compose the portfolio of a bank, which has an exposure in relations with the respective country. In the literature approaching the country risk, the market risk is as inexistent or it is treated with superficiality, although it constitutes a fundamental component of the banking risk, concerning the development of the activities that unfold on these markets. From this perspective the approach of the country risk is insufficient and the developed methodologies must be extended through including this last aspect. But this paper does not purpose to introduce new components in the methodologies of analysis concerning the country risk and the market risk. The {{administration of}} a financial activities portfolio usually generates two categories of risks: the risk exposure and the market risk. The purpose is to present the evolution of the country risk of Romania through using the specific statistic indicators with the granted classification by the main rating agencies. 	The paper has three principal parts - the first tries to familiarize the reader with the definitions and the fundamentals of the country risk analysis, the second presents the statistic indicators and methods used in the assessment of the country risk and the third focuses on the Romanian case. ...|$|E

40|$|The cost {{of state}} {{bankruptcy}} in the euro area is incalculable {{due to the}} repercussions for the financial system. As a result of contagion effects, {{there is a risk}} that the entire Monetary Union could be pushed into deep recession. This forces euro area member states to implement rescue packages during periods of crisis, at a high costto taxpayers. The bailout policy adopted during the most recent crisis was an indication that sovereign debt in the euro area would be subject to joint liability. This temporarily eliminated incentives for national budgetary discipline. On this basis, it is argued that enhancing the institutional framework of the euro area in the long term by issuing common bonds would alleviate existing distortions of fiscal incentive effects in the euro area. Such a "safe haven" for the euro area could make a major contribution to stabilizing the financial system during periods of crisis. The positive impact this would have on the banking system could reduce the indirect costs of restructuring government debt which, in turn, would make restructuring debt from <b>public</b> <b>debtors</b> in the euro area economically feasible. This would strengthen the no-bailout rule which, again, is likely to result in an increasingly risk-based approach to interest on national debt. With this in mind, limited joint liability under strict conditions would be a welcome measure since it takes advantage of market incentives to cut public spending and consequently helps alleviate the problem of over-indebtedness in the euro area in the long term. As a prerequisite for creating common bonds, binding fiscal rules must be introduced in order that some sovereignty rights can be delegated to a central fiscal authority. In the short term, therefore, the required conditions for common bonds are not in place...|$|R

Where private creditors use short-term debt to check sovereign debtor’s moral hazard, there is the risk of self-fulfilling crises. In this context, we conclude that the proposal of the Meltzer Commission—for unconditional financial support, but only to states that pre-qualify—could be the source of increased instability.

40|$|Enforced {{execution}} is {{the legal}} way by which the Creditor under an enforceable order protects his rights by resorting to coercive force of the state. When the Debtor does not comply voluntarily, the Creditor may appeal to the Bailiff to commence the enforced execution in all manner prescribed by law. Of course, the start of compulsory execution {{is limited by the}} conditions of admissibility imperatively specified in the law, principally the condition to exist an enforceable order owned by the Creditor. Regarding the order to be enforced, it can be represented either by an enforceable or final judgement, with provisional enforcement or any other document that can be enforced. Procedurally, the provisions of Art. 712 of the Civil Procedure Code allow the introduction by a Creditor who has a litigation to execution against the execution itself, against the Closures issued by the Bailiff, and against any other act of enforcement. Jurisdiction of the Court in this matter will be of the Executor Court or the Court in whose district the Debtor is situated, on the date of the appeal. The appeal of the Debtor questions the Parties not only over the acts of execution because the appeal is also allowed over the explanations relative to the meaning, scope or application of the enforceable order, but in the conditions limited by the legal nature of this order. Thus, according to the law when enforceable order is not issued by a Court or Arbitration may be invoked before an Executor Court including reasons of fact or law which could not be discussed during an earlier trial, in the first instance or in an appeal. Basically, if enforced execution is under an enforceable order that is not from a Court, these reasons can be invoked when there is no other processual mean for its abolition. There also can be submitted a complaint against the Closure by which was upheld the appeal for an enforced execution, and the act of execution concerning the division of the common property or common goods. For the purposes of the foregoing ideas, the article details the mean of introduction the execution appeal for recovery of emoluments arising from a legal labour relationship. Creditor’s debt is represented by the financial rights related to the management function held in a public institution. Regarding the enforcement order it is the Decision of the Appeal Court by which the <b>Debtor</b> <b>public</b> institution is obliged to cover the material damage suffered by the Creditor civil servant, starting from the time of his dismissal from the management function until effectively reintegration on the same position.

40|$|The Global Financial Crisis since 2008 {{has left}} {{in its wake}} the most severe {{economic}} downturn since the Great Depression. Governments and entire national economies have been sacrificed to save the financial sector and its major clients. Bailing out banks, bondholders and Wall Street brokerage houses – the institutions whose mismanagement, over-lending and outright fraud led to the crash – has widened economic polarization and caused fiscal strains. This has led many countries to reconsider the character of macroeconomic management and behind it, the body {{of economic and political}} theory guiding today’s societies. What seemed at first glance to be a systemic policy failure of mainstream economics is coming to be seen as not so much a failure as part of an orchestrated class to protect financial wealth and its allied rentier sectors. Economic policy has passed {{out of the hands of}} elected democratic government to central banks and other government agencies controlled by financial planners and the rentier class behind them. Their post-crisis management has enabled these interests to gain control of a large swath of the <b>public</b> domain of <b>debtor</b> countries, along with industries and real estate in the creditor nations themselves. The Communist Manifesto’s classic dictum that “the executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie” no longer seems to be an exaggeration, but it may be updated to describe modern governments above all as committees to subsidize and rescue the banking and financial sector, which has become the manager and central planner of today’s global economy. The effect is to curtail industrial capacity, subordinating the forces of industrial capitalism to an extractive (and increasingly concentrated) financial superstructure consolidating its power by bank loans, bond and stock ownership – turning the rest of society into debtors, renters and buyers of monopolized goods and services. What remains in dispute is just who comprises the today’s ruling class and where its policy program is leading. The present collection of essays trace how Thorstein Veblen described the way in which the mid- 19 th century’s industrial capitalism was becoming centered on what today is called the Finance, Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE) sector. Each author in this volume discusses the character of today’s capitalism, and how and why the capitalist class remains politically dominant despite the fact that it repeatedly fails to fulfill the requirements of economic leadership it claims to fulfill. Together, these papers contribute to a better understanding of “capital in the twenty first century,” to use the phrase that has become popular following Thomas Piketty’s best seller. Veblen made numerous contributions to a diverse set of fields. Not surprisingly, he has been considered by some to be an economist and by others a sociologist. To others he seemed broadly to be an anthropologist, political or cultural theorist. The authors of the current collection view him as a critic of “the established order of business,” continuing in the tradition of classical political economy to analyze the often dysfunctional modern world that, in his mind, required a restructuring. Unlike today’s neoclassical economics, classical political economists distinguished between earned and unearned income, that is, the types of income accruing to productive and unproductive labor and investment respectively. The labor theory of value found its counterpart in the “rent theory” of prices. This distinction between intrinsic cost-value and market price (with economic rent reflecting the margin of price over value) provided a basis for analyzing the ownership of wealth and other special privileges to extract income without creating real value by producing goods and services. The policy conclusion of this classical approach was that material wealth adding to overall well-being could be augmented only by productive investment. By the same token, a subset of unproductive rentier property and financial claims was extractive rather than productive and hence, was a form of economic overhead, not real wealth. This was the essential theme of classical rent theory, which Veblen continued at a time when the economics mainstream was denying the distinction between rent extractors and industrial investors. Pursuing the logic of classical rent theory, Veblen investigated the consequences of concentrating ownership in the hands of an evolving capitalist class. He described “absentee ownership” as the “latest stage of capitalism” and “the new order of business” at the outset of the twentieth century. “It may be said, of course, and perhaps truthfully, that the absentee owners of the country’s industrial equipment,” he wrote, “come in for a disproportionate share of the ‘national dividend,’ and that they and their folks habitually consume their share in superfluities; but no urgent moral indignation appears to be aroused by all that. ” This class of absentee owners comprised a new aristocracy. Like their feudal counterparts, they did not directly manage the means of production or other assets, which took on the form mainly of corporate bonds and stock. Real estate investment was largely for speculative purposes to obtain price gains, while the stock market likewise aimed increasingly at making purely financial gains. For Veblen, absentee ownership as the latest stage of capitalism consisted of three pillars: “the mechanical system of industry, the price system, and the national establishment. ” This tripartite social organization was centered on the financial sector, whose major business concern was to create industrial monopolies while gaining control of national politics. Veblen called these monopolists and political deep state the “vested interests. ” The credit system was the core of the financial sector, which was employed to gain unearned income on behalf of these vested interests.
