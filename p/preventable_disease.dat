The {{realisation}} that a young, fit, England footballer could die of a <b>preventable</b> <b>disease</b> sparked a massive rise in demand for vaccination, and a memorial fund launched in his name by the club and local newspapers endowed a research fellowship in the University of Birmingham's Department of Medicine.|$|E
25|$|ONE {{works with}} {{volunteer}} campaigners in its different markets {{to raise awareness}} and lobby governments to fight extreme poverty and <b>preventable</b> <b>disease.</b> ONE Youth Ambassadors are selected yearly from Ireland, the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy to support its grassroots mobilization and advocacy goals across Europe. ONE Champions work to advance ONE's goals in Africa through lobby meetings, campaigning, and awareness raising. In the United States and Canada, ONE field organizers coordinate campaigning efforts, lobby members of Congress and Parliament, and host community awareness events. On college campuses across the U.S., ONE Campus chapters are run by students who mobilize their peers to participate in ONE's advocacy campaigns. ONE Campus chapters aim to teach students about extreme poverty and encourages members to campaign for lifesaving investments and US development policies.|$|E

500|$|Jeff {{appeared}} at Kick Butts Day, a protest {{organized by the}} Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and youth advocates, which was held outside Philip Morris' annual shareholders' meeting in New York City on May 6, 2015. The protests featured a flash mob with fifty dancers performing a choreographed dance to a song with the lyrics, [...] "We don't want your cigarettes. Jeff we can!" [...] The performance ended with the mascot: [...] "rolling {{around on the floor}} in a coughing fit and loss of breath". Shana Narula, the campaign's coordinator, said: The whole concept is to use Jeff and the hashtag #JeffWeCan and #StopMarlboro to show that these marketing tactics are not allowed and tobacco is still the leading cause of <b>preventable</b> <b>disease</b> and death in the world. And the fact is it's the only consumer product that when used as intended, it kills its user. This is very, very unique — no other consumer product does this. Most people think that tobacco is not really an issue in this country anymore and that's completely not true. That's what we want to shed light on today, in a fashion where people will take notice.|$|E
2500|$|One {{school of}} thought contends the human {{physiology}} is fine-tuned to an intake of 4,000–12,000IU/day from sun exposure with concomitant serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of 40 to 80ng/ml and [...] this is required for optimal health. Proponents of this view, who include {{some members of the}} panel that drafted a now-superseded 1997 report on vitamin D from the IOM, contend the IOM's warning about serum concentrations above 50ng/ml lacks biological plausibility. They suggest, for some people, reducing the risk of <b>preventable</b> <b>disease</b> requires a higher level of vitamin D than that recommended by the IOM.|$|E
2500|$|The {{island was}} also hosting about 1,100 laborers taken to Noemfoor by the Japanese: a 600-strong Formosan (Taiwanese) {{auxiliary}} labor unit and 500 Indonesian civilian forced laborers. According {{to the official}} U.S. Army history, over 3,000 Indonesian men, women, and children were shipped to Noemfoor by the Japanese military. Most came from Soerabaja (Surabaya) and other large cities on Java. These Javanese civilians were forced to construct roads and airfields, mostly by hand. Little food, clothing, shelter or medical attention were provided. Many attempted to steal Japanese supplies, and were executed. Others died from starvation and <b>preventable</b> <b>disease.</b> Survivors also alleged that sick Javanese were buried alive. The Formosan labor troops had originally numbered about 900 men. They had also worked on airfield and road construction, on ½ the ration of rice issued to regular Japanese troops. When they became ill from exhaustion, hunger, or tropical diseases, they were put in a convalescent camp. In {{the words of the}} U.S. official history: [...] "There, their rations were again cut in half, and the shelter and blankets provided covered but a fraction of the inmates.

2500|$|Specifically, {{it was the}} Burmese commanders' {{ability to}} lead a {{multi-ethnic}} army which consisted of regiments from {{various parts of the}} empire that made the invasion even possible. (Upper Burma, the home of Konbaung Dynasty, alone could not have launched an offensive war against a more populous Siam, without its policy of having the conquered lands contribute to its next war effort.) In this war, the Burmese command was able to inspire (or push) their troops. Historian Harvey writes: [...] "When roused, the men fought with spirit, vying among themselves as to who should first mount the wall; although he wonders why: [...] "They died like flies from <b>preventable</b> <b>disease,</b> and suffered ghastly wounds for which they received no thanks from the King, as the loss of a limb, even in honourable service, disqualified a man from entering the palace: His Majesty's sight must not be sullied by reality." [...] Equally important, the Burmese commanders were able to motivate their Siamese levies, which by the battle of Ayutthaya made up a significant minority of the Burmese army. The Siamese participation in the Burmese army highlights the fact that the war was between the rulers, not between nations.|$|E
2500|$|During the American Civil War Ordronaux {{served as}} an army surgeon {{stationed}} in New York. He also acted as a military medical advisor and between 1861 and 1863 he published two textbooks {{on the health of}} armies, and an instruction manual of medical criteria for examining recruits. In the introduction to the latter, which was written for the United States Sanitary Commission, he said, [...] "The preservation of health in armies, is everywhere a subject of recognized importance. So much, in fact, depends upon it, that precautionary measures in this behalf can never be exaggerated. All that can be done, should be done to protect troops against <b>preventable</b> <b>disease.</b> It seems to have been formerly believed, that the presence of a surgeon in each regiment was all sufficient for this purpose and that officers and men could go their way free from any responsibility or apprehension on that score. But experience has proved that the preservation of health, in either one man, or many, is not purely objective with surgeons. Too much, in this particular, is expected from them, and too little is done by officers to cooperate with them. Armies, like patients, must act in concert with their medical advisers, and make the matter of health subjective as well as objective. Officers and men need an insight into the general principles of hygiene, {{in order to be able}} to assist, themselves, in furthering prophylactic measures. To supply them with the requisite amount of information, the accompanying popular manual has therefore been prepared." ...|$|E

God {{grant that}} the very sight of the {{calamity}} with which we have stood face to face, may call out in us some valiant practical resolve, which may benefit this whole nation, and bow all hearts as the heart of one man, to do some one right thing.

[...] What but the thing which is pointed to by plain and terrible fact, as the lesson which God must mean us to learn, if He means us to learn any, from what has so nearly befallen?

Two hundred thousand persons, I am told, have died of preventable fever since the Prince Consort's death ten years ago. Is that not a sin to bow our hearts as the heart of one man? Ah, if this foul and needless disease, by striking once at the very highest, shall bring home to us the often told, seldom heeded fact that it is striking perpetually at hundreds among the very lowest, whom we leave to sicken and die in dens unfit for men--unfit for dogs; if this tragedy shall awaken all loyal citizens to demand and to enforce, as a duty to their sovereign, their country, and their God, a sanatory reform in town and country, immediate, wholesale, imperative; if it shall awaken the ministers of religion to preach about that, and hardly aught but that-- till there is not a fever ally or a malarious ditch left in any British city;--then indeed this fair and precious life will not have been imperilled in vain, and generations yet unborn will bless the memory of a prince who sickened as poor men sicken, and all but died, as poor men die, that his example--and, it may be hereafter, his exertions--might deliver the poor from dirt, disease, and death.|$|E
