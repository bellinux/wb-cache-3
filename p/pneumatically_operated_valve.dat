40|$|A neutral gas mass {{spectrometer}} was flown to Venus {{as part of}} the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe to measure the composition of its lower atmosphere. The instrument, mounted in the Sounder Probe, was activated after the probe entered the top of the atmosphere, and it obtained data during the descent from 62 km to the surface. Atmospheric gases were sampled through a pair of microleaks, the effluent from which was pumped by a combination of ion and getter pumping. A <b>pneumatically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valve,</b> controlled by the ambient atmospheric pressure, maintained the ion source pressure at a nearly constant value during descent while the atmospheric pressure varied by three orders of magnitude. A single focusing magnetic sector field {{mass spectrometer}} with mass resolution sufficient to reasonably separate argon from C 3 H 4 at 40 amu provided the mass analysis and relative abundance measurements. A microprocessor controlled the operation of the mass spectrometer through a highly efficient peak-tip stepping routine and data compression algorithm that effected a scan of the mass spectrum from 1 to 208 amu in 64 sec while requiring an information rate of only 40 bits/sec to return the data to earth. A subscale height altitude resolution was thus obtained. Weight, size, and power requirements were minimized to be consistent with interplanetary flight contraints...|$|E

40|$|Seismic {{qualification}} {{tests on}} <b>pneumatically</b> <b>operated</b> directional <b>valve</b> assembly and fire alarm panel {{were carried out}} in the shake table facility in Structural Integrity Division. Determination of the fundamental frequency for directional valve was carried out in all the three directions independently through exploratory vibration test as per ANSI B 16. 41 Annexure E (Para E- 3) to ascertain extent of flexibility as defined in the standard. The fire alarm panel was seismically qualified by using sinusoidal input motion in all the three directions independently to ascertain its capabilities to withstand the expected dynamic, seismic stresses and to ensure that the valves will not be subjected to performance degradation or malfunction under seismic conditions.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of the design testing of large (36 -inch diameter) butterfly valves under high flow conditions. The two butterfly <b>valves</b> were <b>pneumatically</b> <b>operated</b> air-open, air-shut <b>valves</b> (termed valves 1 and 2). These butterfly valves were redesigned to improve their ability to function under high flow conditions. Concern was raised regarding the ability of the butterfly valves to function as required with high flow-induced torque imposed on the valve discs during high steam flow conditions. High flow testing was required to address the flow-induced torque concerns. The valve testing was done using a heavily instrumented piping system. This test program was called the Large Scale Steam Valve Test (LSSVT). The LSSVT program demonstrated that the redesigned <b>valves</b> <b>operated</b> satisfactorily under high flow conditions...|$|R
5000|$|De Hoop is {{what the}} Dutch {{describe}} as a [...] "stellingmolen" [...] It is a three-storey smock mill on a three-storey base. The stage is at third-floor level, 7.00 m above ground level. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch with a continuous chain. The cap rotates on 24 wooden blocks. The sails on the outer sailstock are Common sails, with leading edges streamlined on the Fok system. The sails on the inner sailstock are Ten Have sails, with leading edges fitted with aerofoils on the Van Bussel system. Both have a span of 24.55 m. The sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft, which was cast by IJzergieterij Hardinxveld-Giessendam as number 47. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 65 cogs. This drives the wallower (32 cogs) {{at the top of}} the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel, which has 87 cogs, drives the two lantern pinion stone nuts, which have 27 and 28 staves. These drive the 1.40 m and 1.50 m diameter millstones. A third pair of stones is driven by an electric motor so production could continue on days when there was not enough wind.Several modern developments were added during the 1992 rebuild. A chain elevator lifted grain from the ground floor to the grain silos on the third floor (first floor in the smock) from where it could be fed by gravity to one of the pairs of millstones. The grain flow to the silos and from silo to millstone was computer controlled by <b>pneumatically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valves.</b> Also a central dust extraction system was added. Flour was collected on the first floor in a large silo and mixer from where it could be bagged on the ground floor. Unfortunately following years of standstill and disuse these systems are no longer functional. The ground floor also houses a small shop selling flour and bread making products.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} the {{development}} of a heat exchanger as a pilot plant for educational purpose is discussed and the use of neural network for controlling the process is being presented. The aim of the study is to highlight the need of a specific Pseudo Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) to excite a process under control. As the neural network is a data driven technique, the method for data generation plays an important role. In light of this a careful experimentation procedure for data generation was crucial task. Heat exchange is a complex process, which has a capacity and a time lag as process elements. The proposed system is a typical pipe-in- pipe type heat exchanger. The complexity of the system demands careful selection, proper installation and commissioning. The temperature, flow, and pressure sensors {{play a vital role in}} the control performance. The final control element used is a <b>pneumatically</b> <b>operated</b> control <b>valve.</b> While carrying out the experimentation on heat exchanger a welldrafted procedure is followed giving utmost attention towards safety of the system. The results obtained are encouraging and revealing the fact that if the process details are known completely as far as process parameters are concerned and utilities are well stabilized then feedback systems are suitable, whereas neural network control paradigm is useful for the processes with nonlinearity and less knowledge about process. The implementation of NN control reinforces the concepts of process control and NN control paradigm. The result also underlined the importance of excitation signal typically for that process. Data acquisition, processing, and presentation in a typical format are the most important parameters while validating the results. Keywords—Process identification, neural network, heat exchanger.
