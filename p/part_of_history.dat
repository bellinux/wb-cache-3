5|$|Alumni of the University of North Dakota {{have become}} notable {{in a variety}} of {{different}} fields including politics and government, business, science, literature, arts and entertainment, and athletics. Eight Governors of North Dakota were educated at UND, including Fred G. Aandahl, Louis B. Hanna, Lynn Frazier, William Langer, John Moses, Ragnvald A. Nestos, Allen I. Olson, and Ed Schafer, who was also the US Secretary of Agriculture from 2008–2009. Former Deputy National Security Advisor at the White House, Mark Pfeifle is a 1997 graduate in the School of Communications. Many U.S. Senators and Representatives of North Dakota were also graduates of UND, including former Senator Byron Dorgan and former Representative Earl Pomeroy. Former House Majority Leader Dick Armey is a UND graduate. Ronald Davies, a UND graduate and former federal judge, became a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> when he ordered the integration of Little Rock Central High School during the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E

Instead, they view the dominant stream of modern science as a projection of Western men's values. The privilege of determining what is considered scientific knowledge has been controlled by men, {{and for the most}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> restricted to men. Bondi and Miles list examples including the medicalization of childbirth and the industrialization of plant reproduction.|$|E

25|$|Two {{subspecies}} of F. vesca were identified: F. sylvestris alba and F. sylvestris semperflorens. The {{introduction of}} F. virginiana from Eastern North America to Europe in the 17th century {{is an important}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> because this species {{gave rise to the}} modern strawberry. The new species gradually spread through the continent and did not become completely appreciated {{until the end of the}} 18th century. When a French excursion journeyed to Chile in 1712, it introduced the strawberry plant with female flowers that resulted in the common strawberry that we have today.|$|E
25|$|Robert d'Harcourt {{fought against}} {{prejudice}} {{in order to}} render the most objective image of Germany he could, whether positive or negative. Former prisoner Charles de Gaulle firmly believed that the countries’ populations lay {{at the base of}} Franco-German relations. These former prisoners allowed themselves to transcend their captivity and all it had engendered. However, such men were never designated as former prisoners of war per se. Prisoners appeared as men who should indirectly use their experiences in order to be recognised as a result. The status of prisoner was not one that was proclaimed proudly. It forced its owner to leave behind a part of his own story in order to allow another <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> to develop: the history of reconciliation.|$|E
25|$|Vietnam's {{recorded}} history stretches {{back to the}} mid-to-late 3rd century BCE, when Âu Lạc and Nanyue (Nam Việt in Vietnamese) were established (Nanyue conquered Âu Lạc in 179 BCE). Pre-historic Vietnam was {{home to some of}} the world's earliest civilizations and societies—making them one of the world's first people who practiced agriculture. The Red River valley formed a natural geographic and economic unit, bounded to the north and west by mountains and jungles, to the east by the sea and to the south by the Red River Delta. The need to have a single authority to prevent floods of the Red River, to cooperate in constructing hydraulic systems, trade exchange, and to fight invaders, {{led to the creation of}} the first Vietnamese states approximately 2879BC. Another truly influential <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> in Vietnam occurred during the late Bronze Age, when the Đông Sơn culture dramatically advanced the civilization. Vietnam's peculiar geography made it a difficult country to attack, which is why Vietnam under the Hùng kings was for so long an independent and self-contained state. The Xích Tỵs and Qins were among the earliest foreign aggressors of Vietnam, but the ancient Vietnamese managed to regain control of the country soon after the invasions.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by Manson, Sköld, and Ben Grosse. It was recorded at Ocean Way Recording and the band's own Doppelherz Blood Treatment Facility in Los Angeles, as well as Grosse's The Mix Room in Burbank, California. Most of the songwriting effort was shared between Tim Sköld, John 5 and Manson, with the latter describing it as the most focused record in the band's discography. During the album's early stages of development, Manson indicated that both Jordison and Canadian musician Peaches had contributed to material, although neither artist appears on the album. Several songs on the record feature backing vocals Andrew Baines of Tennessee, a 16-year-old fan who {{had been diagnosed with}} a terminal illness. This collaboration had been facilitated by the Make-A-Wish Foundation, with Manson saying that he [...] "wanted to make Andrew a permanent <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> sealed up in distortion and megabytes of plastic." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was also}} a real Dayton out there, a charming Ohio city, famous as {{the birthplace of the}} Wright brothers. Its {{citizens}} energized us from the outset. Unlike the population of, say, New York City, Geneva or Washington, which would scarcely notice another conference, Daytonians were proud to be <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>history.</b> Large signs at the commercial airport hailed Dayton as the [...] "temporary center of international peace". The local newspapers and television stations covered the story from every angle, drawing the people deeper into the proceedings. When we ventured into a restaurant or a shopping center downtown, people crowded around, saying that they were praying for us. Warren Christopher was given at least one standing ovation in a restaurant. Families on the air base placed [...] "candles of peace" [...] in their front windows, and people gathered in peace vigils outside the base. One day they formed a [...] "peace chain", although it was not large enough to surround the sprawling eight-thousand-acre base. Ohio's famous ethnic diversity was on display.|$|E
500|$|One Day in History was {{launched}} as a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>History</b> Matters, a campaign led by several heritage {{organisations such as}} the National Trust, English Heritage and the Historic Houses Association, in order to draw attention towards the importance of history in everyday life. Its aim was to record for posterity what day-to-day life was like in the UK during 2006. British people were invited to write a blog {{of what they did}} on 17 October 2006, and to submit it {{to become a part of}} a large online diary. The project was open to all UK citizens and individuals of British origin, and was inspired by Mass Observation, a similar social research project founded in 1937. The date was chosen to be 17 October by History Matters in the hope that it would be [...] "an ordinary day much like any other of no particular national significance", and would therefore reflect the everyday life of its participants. Historian Dan Snow explained that the project was intended to be [...] "a detailed account of people's normal lives when they're doing nothing out of the ordinary. ... It's those mundane details, those boring details that will seem extraordinary to people hundreds of years in the future." [...] The organisers hoped that the contributors could also discuss the impact of history or heritage on their lives that day in their submissions.|$|E

500|$|Two {{years of}} {{kindergarten}} were offered, beginning at age four, and students progressed through to first grade {{with other students}} their age. The Cottage School was free to all students, and was supported both by Coonley's own resources and funds raised by the Kindergarten Education Association. The Association, of which Coonley was president, promoted new educational ideas and raised money to help support them. In 1915, John Dewey and his daughter Evelyn featured the Cottage School in their book, The Schools of To-Morrow, which examined how progressive {{schools around the country}} put new educational ideas into action. They were especially struck by how prominently nature featured in school life, noting that they have, for example, a rare bird that is as much a personality in school life as any of the children, and the children, having cared for him and watched his growth and habits, have become much more interested in wild birds. In the backyard is a goat, the best liked thing on the place, where the children have raised him from a little kid; and they still do all the work of caring for him. The Deweys held the Cottage School as an example of training in good citizenship, commenting on its mock elections, self-government, and public service: [...] "The school organized by the pupils into a civic league has made itself responsible for the conditions of the streets in certain portions of town, and is not only cleaning up but trying to get the rest of the town interested in the problem." [...] The teaching of English was also noted, as it was not taught as a separate subject but as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> lessons, journal-keeping, and other exercises. Dewey wrote, [...] "The emphasis is put on helping the child to express his ideas; but such work provides ample opportunity for the required drill in the mechanics of writing." ...|$|E
