5|$|The Compulsory Process Clause {{guarantees}} the defendant {{the right to}} obtain favorable witnesses at trial. For example, the Clause prevents a jurisdiction from precluding defendants from calling their codefendants as witnesses. Similarly, the Clause prevents the government from deporting a witness whose testimony would have been both material and favorable to the defense. The right does not pre-empt reasonable <b>procedural</b> <b>rules.</b> Thus, the right does not prevent the preclusion of defense witnesses as a discovery sanction.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May 2009, Yuri Savenko {{wrote to}} the then President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev an open letter, in which Savenko asked Medvedev {{to submit to the}} State Duma a draft law {{prepared}} by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to address the sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations, which Savenko attributed to the lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization. The open letter says that the level of the expert reports has dropped {{to such an extent that}} it is often a matter of not only the absence of entire sections of the report, even such as the substantiation of its findings, and not only the gross contradiction of its findings to the descriptive section of the report, but it is often a matter of concrete statements which are so contrary to generally accepted scientific terms that doubts about the disinterestedness of the experts arise. According to the letter, courts, in violation of <b>procedural</b> <b>rules,</b> do not analyze the expert report, its coherence and consistency in all its parts, do not check experts' findings for their accuracy, completeness, and objectivity.|$|E

25|$|The {{powers of}} the Supreme Court are defined in Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution. These {{functions}} may be generally divided into two – judicial functions and administrative functions. The administrative functions of the Court pertain to the supervision and control over the Philippine judiciary and its employees, as well as over members of the Philippine bar. Pursuant to these functions, the Court is empowered to order a change of venue of trial {{in order to avoid}} a miscarriage of justice and to appoint all officials and employees of the judiciary. The Court is further authorized to promulgate the rules for admission to the practice of law, for legal assistance to the underprivileged, and the <b>procedural</b> <b>rules</b> to be observed in all courts.|$|E
40|$|Courts and {{scholars}} have operated on the implicit {{assumption that the}} Supreme Court’s “one person, one vote” jurisprudence put redistricting politics on a fixed, ten-year cycle. Recent redistricting controversies in Colorado, Texas, and elsewhere, however, have undermined this assumption, highlighting {{the fact that most}} states are currently free to redraw election districts as often as they like. This essay explores whether partisan fairness—a normative commitment that both scholars and the Supreme Court have identified as a central concern of districting arrangements— would be promoted by a <b>procedural</b> <b>rule</b> limiting the frequency of redistricting. While the literature has not considered this question, scholars generally are pessimistic about the capacity of procedural redistricting regulations to curb partisan gerrymandering. In contrast, this essay argues that a <b>procedural</b> <b>rule</b> limiting the frequency of redistricting will promote partisan fairness by introducing beneficial uncertainty in the redistricting process and by regularizing the redistricting agenda...|$|R
2500|$|In Kantian philosophy, a {{transcendental}} schema (plural: schemata; from , [...] "form, shape, figure") is the <b>procedural</b> <b>rule</b> {{by which}} a category or pure, non-empirical [...] concept [...] {{is associated with a}} sense impression. A private, subjective intuition is thereby discursively thought to be a representation of an external object. Transcendental schemata are supposedly produced by the imagination in relation to time.|$|R

25|$|Chile {{approved}} {{class actions}} in 2004. The Chilean model is technically an opt-out issue class action {{followed by a}} compensatory stage which can be collective or individual. This means that the class action is designed to declare the defendant generally liable with erga omnes effects {{if and only if}} the defendant is found liable, and the declaratory judgment can be used then to pursue damages in the same procedure or in individual ones in different jurisdictions. If the latter is the case, the liability cannot be discussed but only the damages. There under the Chilean <b>procedural</b> <b>rules,</b> one particular case works as an opt-out class action for damages. This is the case when defendants can identify and compensate consumer directly, i.e. because it is their banking institution. In such cases the judge can skip the compensatory stage and order redress directly. Since 2005 more than 100 cases have been filed, mostly by Servicio Nacional del Consumidor , the Chilean consumer protection agency. Salient cases have been the case Condecus v. BancoEstado, and SERNAC v. La Polar.|$|E
25|$|Garner {{has contributed}} to the field of <b>procedural</b> <b>rules.</b> From 1992 to 1994, he revised all {{amendments}} to the sets of Federal Rules—Civil, Appellate, Evidence, Bankruptcy, and Criminal—for the United States Judicial Conference. In the mid-1990s, he restyled the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which were adopted by the Judicial Conference, then by the United States Supreme Court, and enacted by Congress. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were restyled in 1993–1994 and adopted on December 1, 2007. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts has printed and distributed Garner's booklet Guidelines for Drafting and Editing Court Rules (1st ed. 1996, 5th ed. 2007). Garner has revised the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, the California Rules of Appellate Procedure, the California Judicial Council Rules, the Local Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, and the Rules on Judicial-Conduct and Disability Proceedings (for federal courts). In 2015, after a 15-year hiatus, he returned as a style consultant to the U.S. Judicial Conference's Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.|$|E
500|$|Finally, Alito {{wrote that}} the {{commission}} procedures as a whole do not {{provide a basis for}} deeming the commissions to be illegitimate.

500|$|In June, a {{group of}} 132 {{supporters}} of Paul, demanding the freedom as delegates to the upcoming Republican party national convention to cast votes for Paul, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against the Republican National Committee and 55 state and territorial Republican party organizations for allegedly coercing delegates to choose Mitt Romney as the party’s presidential nominee. The suit alleged {{that there had been}} “a systematic campaign of election fraud at state conventions,” employing rigging of voting machines, ballot stuffing, and falsification of ballot totals. The suit further pointed to incidents at state conventions, including acts of violence and changes in <b>procedural</b> <b>rules,</b> allegedly intended to deny participation of Paul supporters in the party decision-making and to prevent votes from being cast for Paul. An attorney representing the complainants said that Paul campaign advisor Doug Wead had voiced support for the legal action. Paul himself told CNN that although the lawsuit was not a part of his campaign’s strategy and that he had not been advising his supporters to sue, {{he was not going to}} tell his supporters not to sue, if they had a legitimate argument. “If they’re not following the rules, you have a right to stand up for the rules.

40|$|Non-precedential {{judicial}} opinions {{issued by}} the federal appellate courts have generated significant controversy. Given that the federal appellate courts are unlikely to abandon the practice of issuing non-precedential opinions on their own, what other options exist for prohibiting the practice? This article discusses the constitutionality of a <b>procedural</b> <b>rule</b> or statute prohibiting the federal appellate courts from prospectively designating selected opinions as non-precedential. It explains how the rules governing non-precedential opinions allow federal appellate courts to 2 ̆ 2 opt out 2 ̆ 2 of their own rules of precedent. It then examines the rulemaking process, showing how the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure are promulgated pursuant to delegated legislative authority and can, therefore, regulate only matters that Congress could regulate by statute. With those premises in mind, the article then explores the constitutional limits of Congress 2 ̆ 7 s ability to regulate the courts 2 ̆ 7 use of precedent. It shows that a federal statute or <b>procedural</b> <b>rule</b> prohibiting prospective designation of selected opinions as non-precedential would be constitutional using both formalist and functionalist reasoning. As long as the statute or rule did not specify the weight federal appellate courts must accord to their own opinions, it would not encroach impermissibly on the courts 2 ̆ 7 Article III judicial power...|$|R
