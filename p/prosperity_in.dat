5|$|According {{to later}} Jain texts, Mahavira's {{childhood}} name was Vardhamāna ("the one who grows"), {{because of the}} increased <b>prosperity</b> <b>in</b> the kingdom {{at the time of}} his birth. According to the Kalpasutras, he was called Mahavira ("the great hero") by the gods because he stood steadfast in the midst of dangers and fears, hardships and calamities. Mahavira is also called a Tirthankara.|$|E
5|$|After the Act of Union of 1707, growing <b>prosperity</b> <b>in</b> Scotland {{led to a}} {{spate of}} new building, both public and private. The threat of Jacobite insurrection or {{invasion}} meant that Scotland saw more military building than England in this period. Military structures relied {{on the strength of}} inclined and angled engineered masonry and earthen toppings to deflect and absorb artillery fire. This spate of military building culminated in the construction of Fort George near Inverness (1748–69), with its projecting bastions and redoubts.|$|E

Another important figure of the times was Marie Rée who ran the local newspaper Aalborg Stiftstidende until 1900, often promoting women's rights.|$|E

5|$|During their {{relatively}} short tenure, the Ayyubids ushered {{in an era}} of economic <b>prosperity</b> <b>in</b> the lands they ruled, and the facilities and patronage provided by the Ayyubids led to a resurgence in intellectual activity in the Islamic world. This period was also marked by an Ayyubid process of vigorously strengthening Sunni Muslim dominance in the region by constructing numerous madrasas (Islamic schools of law) in their major cities.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{prosperity}} {{became a}} primary focus in healing revivals. T. L. Osborn began emphasizing <b>prosperity</b> <b>in</b> the 1960s and became {{known for his}} often ostentatious displays of personal wealth. During that decade, Roberts and William Branham criticized other prosperity ministries, arguing that their fund-raising tactics unfairly pressured attendees. These tactics were prompted {{in part by the}} expense of developing nationwide radio networks and campaign schedules. At the same time, leaders of the Pentecostal Assemblies of God denomination often criticized the focus on prosperity taken by independent healing evangelists.|$|E
5|$|St Eleth's Church, Amlwch is {{a parish}} church {{built in the}} Neo-classical style in 1800 in Amlwch, a town {{on the island of}} Anglesey in north Wales.

5|$|The 18th {{century was}} largely one {{of peace and}} declining {{industrial}} <b>prosperity</b> <b>in</b> Somerset. The Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and Northern England spelt the end for most of Somerset's cottage industries.

5|$|A {{simplified}} {{version of}} the model was popularized by Paul Krugman in the 1990s in his book Peddling <b>Prosperity.</b> <b>In</b> this set up there are two firms, one foreign and one domestic which are considering entering a new export market in a third country (or possibly the whole world). The demand in the export market is such that if only one firm enters, {{it will make a}} profit, but if they both enter each will make a loss, perhaps because of initial set up, infrastructure, product development, marketing or other fixed costs of entry. The matrix below presents a stylized example of the game that the two firms are engaged in.|$|E
5|$|After the Act of Union of 1707, growing <b>prosperity</b> <b>in</b> Scotland {{led to a}} {{spate of}} new building. Scotland {{produced}} {{some of the most}} significant architects of this era, including: Colen Campbell (1676–1729), James Gibbs (1682–1754) and William Adam (1689–1748), who created work that to some degree looked to classical models. Campbell was influenced by the Palladian style and has been credited with founding Georgian architecture. Architectural historian Howard Colvin has speculated that he was associated with James Smith and that Campbell may even have been his pupil. He spent most of his career in Italy and England and developed a rivalry with fellow Scot James Gibbs. Gibbs trained in Rome and also practiced mainly in England. His architectural style did incorporate Palladian elements, as well as forms from Italian baroque and Inigo Jones, but was most strongly influenced by the interpretation of the Baroque by Sir Christopher Wren.|$|E

5|$|An {{unfavorable}} mail line {{also had}} an early and lasting influence on {{the fortunes of the}} town. When the mail route was established in 1829, Randolph was put {{at the end of a}} branch route of the mail line and received mail only once a week. Failed railroad development further contributed to the demise of the town; and in 1852, residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. Financial depression and David Crockett's failed attempt to cut a canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River also were problems that had a negative impact on the future of commercial <b>prosperity</b> <b>in</b> Randolph. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice, in September 1862 and again in 1865, discouraging many residents from re-building residences and businesses a second time.|$|E
5|$|As the {{industrialisation}} of {{the valleys}} began {{there was little}} shift {{in the use of}} Welsh as a first language. Initial immigrants were Welsh and {{it was not until the}} 1900s that English workers began settling in any great numbers, but it wasn't these new workers who changed the language; the erosion of Welsh had already begun in the 1860s in the school classrooms. The educational philosophy accepted by schoolmasters and governmental administrators was that English was the language of scholars, and that Welsh was a barrier to moral and commercial <b>prosperity.</b> <b>In</b> 1901 35.4% of Rhondda workers spoke only English but by 1911 this had risen to 43.1%, while Welsh speaking monoglots had dropped from 11.4% to 4.4% in the same period.|$|E
5|$|In 1516, Ottoman forces conquered Mamluk territory. Agricultural {{villages in}} Jordan {{witnessed}} {{a period of}} relative <b>prosperity</b> <b>in</b> the 16th century, but were later abandoned. For the next centuries, Ottoman rule in the region, at times, was virtually absent and reduced to annual tax collection visits. This led to a short-lived occupation by the Wahhabi forces (1803–1812), an ultra-orthodox Islamic movement that emerged in Najd in modern-day Saudi Arabia. Ibrahim Pasha, son of {{the governor of the}} Egypt Eyalet under the request of the Ottoman sultan, rooted out the Wahhabis between 1811 and 1818. In 1833 Ibrahim Pasha turned on the Ottomans and established his rule over the Levant. His oppressive policies led to the unsuccessful peasants' revolt in Palestine in 1834. The cities of Al-Salt and Al-Karak were destroyed by Ibrahim Pasha's forces for harbouring a peasants' revolt leader. Egyptian rule was later forcibly ended, with Ottoman rule restored.|$|E

5|$|Kumbakonam was {{eventually}} ceded to the British East India Company in 1799 by the Thanjavur Maratha ruler Serfoji II (1777 -1832) {{and reached the}} zenith of its <b>prosperity</b> <b>in</b> the late 19th and early 20th century when it emerged as an important center of Brahminism, Hindu religion and European education in the Madras Presidency. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 fostered trade contacts with the United Kingdom. In 1877, railway lines were completed linking Kumbakonam with the ports of Madras, Tuticorin and Nagapattinam. The Tanjore district court was established in Kumbakonam in 1806 and functioned from 1806 to 1863.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{establishment}} of the crusader states in the east helped ease Seljuq pressure on the Byzantine Empire, which had regained some of its Anatolian territory with crusader help, and experienced a period of relative peace and <b>prosperity</b> <b>in</b> the 12th century. The effect on the Muslim dynasties of the east was gradual but important. In the wake of the death of Malik Shah I in 1092, political instability and the division of the Great Seljuq Empire prevented a coherent defence against the Latin states. Cooperation between them remained difficult for many decades, but from Egypt to Syria to Baghdad there were calls for the expulsion of the crusaders, culminating in the recapture of Jerusalem under Saladin later in the century when the Ayyubids had united the surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Lima played an ambivalent {{role in the}} 1821–1824 Peruvian War of Independence; the city suffered exactions from Royalist and Patriot armies alike. After independence, Lima became {{the capital of the}} Republic of Peru. It enjoyed a short period of <b>prosperity</b> <b>in</b> the mid-19th century until the 1879–1883 War of the Pacific when it was occupied and looted by Chilean troops. After the war, the city went through a period of demographic expansion and urban renewal. Population growth accelerated in the 1940s spurred by immigration from the Andean regions of Peru. This gave rise to the proliferation of shanty towns as public services failed {{to keep up with the}} city expansion.|$|E

5|$|With the MDHB on {{the verge}} of {{bankruptcy}} a decision was taken to shut down and sell off the whole of the south docks system. The warehouses were emptied and in 1972 the Albert Dock finally closed down. The Brunswick Dock gates, which separated the South Docks system from the River Mersey, were opened allowing tidal movements in and the process of the clogging up the docks with sewage polluted silt began. In many senses just as the Albert Dock's development had symbolised the <b>prosperity</b> <b>in</b> the Liverpool {{at the time of its}} construction, its subsequent decline after the Second World War symbolised the collapse of the local economy as a whole.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1859, PedroII {{departed}} {{on a trip to}} provinces {{north of}} the capital, visiting Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco and Paraíba. He returned in February 1860 after four months. The trip was a huge success, with the Emperor welcomed everywhere with warmth and joy. The first half of the 1860s saw peace and <b>prosperity</b> <b>in</b> Brazil. Civil liberties were maintained. Freedom of speech had existed since Brazil's independence and was strongly defended by PedroII. He found newspapers from the capital and from the provinces an ideal way to keep track of public opinion and the nation's overall situation. Another means of monitoring the Empire was through direct contacts with his subjects. One opportunity for this was during regular Tuesday and Saturday public audiences, where anyone of any social class, including slaves, could gain admittance and present their petitions and stories. Visits to schools, colleges, prisons, exhibitions, factories, barracks and other public appearances presented further opportunities to gather first-hand information.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} reign of Pietro II Candiano in 932, Venice saw a string of inept leaders such as Pietro III Candiano, Pietro IV Candiano, and Tribuno Memmo. The reputed arrogance and {{ambition}} of these Doges caused {{the deterioration of the}} relationship with the Holy Roman Empire in the west, the stagnancy of the relationship with the Byzantine Empire in the east, and discord at home in the Republic. However, in 991, Pietro II Orseolo became the Doge and spent his reign pushing the boundaries of the Republic further east down the western coast of the Balkan Peninsula with his conquests in Dalmatia in 1000. This strengthened the commercial bonds with the empires of the east, Sicily, Northern Africa, and the Holy Roman Empire, {{and put an end to}} the infighting among the citizens of Venice. Pietro II's negotiations with Byzantine Emperor Basil II to decrease tariffs on Venetian-produced goods helped foster a new age of <b>prosperity</b> <b>in</b> the Republic as Venetian merchants could undercut the competition in the international markets of the Byzantine Empire. Similarly, Pietro II had success developing a new relationship with Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, who displayed his friendship to him by restoring previously seized lands to Venice, opening up routes of free trade between the two states, and exempting all Venetians from taxes in the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E
