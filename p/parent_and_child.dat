Furthermore, <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> took logistical involvement for granted. Finally, children experienced the informational involvement by parents as helpful.

25|$|Many {{counseling}} {{preparation programs}} include courses in human development. Since children {{often do not}} have the ability to articulate thoughts and feelings, counselors will use a variety of media such as crayons, paint, clay, puppets, bibliocounseling (books), toys, board games, et cetera. The use of play therapy is often rooted in psychodynamic theory, but other approaches such as Solution Focused Brief Counseling may also employ the use of play in counseling. In many cases the counselor may prefer to work with the care taker of the child, especially if the child is younger than age four. Yet, by doing so, the counselor risks the perpetuation of maladaptive interactive patterns and the adverse effects on development that have already been affected on the child's end of the relationship. Therefore, contemporary thinking on working with this young age group has leaned towards working with <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> simultaneously within the interaction, as well as individually as needed.|$|E

Through the story characters' attempts at explaining Lad's inexplicable actions using [...] "mythologies of atavism", Terhune reflects his own views of an ideal relationship between a <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>child,</b> namely an [...] "ideology of noble instinct tempered by inflexible training". An unknown third-person narrator also reflects Terhune's perspective and values regarding violence, which is both repelled and embraced. [...] Reflecting patriarchy and the idea of a living creature that obeys unquestioningly and unhesitatingly, the novel indicates that [...] "perfect obedience and submission to a master's will" [...] can be obtained without needing violence or force. Indeed, Terhune regularly decries the use of physical punishment to gain obedience. For example, in the story [...] "His Little Son", Lad takes over the raising of his son, using an even tempered, rational training system that reflects [...] "discipline and firm kindliness". In the end, Lad is stated to have a stronger, love-based relationship with his son versus that of the pup with his mother, the temperamental Lady. Lady raised their son using physical force to impose her will, and thus after she leaves for a period, she is forgotten by him as he holds no love for her.|$|E
