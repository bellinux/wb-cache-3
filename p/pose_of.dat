40|$|Figure 1 : Semantic {{deformation}} transfer learns a {{correspondence between}} <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> two characters from example meshes and synthesizes new <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> the target character from <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> the source character. In this example, given five corresponding <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> two characters (left), our system creates new <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> the bottom character (right) from four <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> the top character. Transferring existing mesh deformation from one character to another {{is a simple}} way to accelerate the laborious process of mesh animation. In many cases, it is useful to preserve the semantic characteristics of the motion instead of its literal deformation. For example, when applying the walking motion of a human to a flamingo, the knees should bend in the opposite direction. Semantic deformation transfer accomplishes this task with a shape space that enables interpolation and projection with standard linear algebra. Given several example mesh pairs, semantic deformation transfer infers a correspondence between the shape spaces of the two characters. This enables automatic transfer <b>of</b> new <b>poses</b> and animations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the problem <b>of</b> estimating the <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> a reference plane in specular shape recovery. Unlike existing methods which require an extra mirror or an extra reference plane and camera, our proposed method recovers the <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> the reference plane directly from its {{reflections on the}} specular surface. By establishing reflection correspondences on the reference plane in three distinct poses, our method estimates the <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> the reference plane in two steps. First, by applying a colinearity constraint to the reflection correspondences, a simple closed-form solution is derived for recovering the <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> the reference plane relative to its initial pose. Second, by applying a ray incidence constraint to the incident rays formed by the reflection correspondences and the visual rays cast from the image, a closed-form solution is derived for recovering the <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> the reference plane relative to the camera. The shape of the specular surface then follows. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data are presented, which demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our proposed method. © 2011 IEEE. published_or_final_versionThe 2011 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), Barcelona, Spain, 6 - 13 November 2011.

5|$|There is no {{indication}} of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most Archaeopteryx specimens became embedded in anoxic sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, {{which suggests that the}} specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (death <b>pose)</b> <b>of</b> the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} novel {{methods for}} estimating the <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> a reference plane from its reflections for specular surface recovery. Traditional methods for specular surface recovery usually introduce a second camera and an auxiliary calibration pattern to calibrate the <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> the reference plane {{with respect to}} the camera. The calibration procedures are comparatively tedious. Auto-estimating the <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> the reference plane is therefore an appealing problem. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, two novel and practical methods are proposed to recover the <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> a moving reference plane from its reflections produced on the specular surface given its initial position. As for the first approach, the reference plane is constrained to undergo an unknown pure translation. By observing the reflections of the moving reference plane produced on the specular surface, a closed form solution is derived for recovering the unknown translation. Degenerate cases in which the proposed method fails are studied. As for the second approach, the constraint on the motion of the reference plane is removed, and the reference plane can move freely. Again, a closed form solution is derived for the unknown motion defined by a rotation matrix and a translation vector, and the degenerate cases are also presented. The thesis finally considers the problem for auto-calibrating the reference plane against the camera for specular surface recovery without prior knowledge of the reference plane’s initial position. By only observing its reflections produced on the specular surface, the <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> the reference planes can be recovered in two steps. First, by applying a collinearity constraint to the specular correspondences, a simple closed form solution is derived for recovering the <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> the reference plane relative to its initial pose. Second, by applying a ray incidence constraint to the incident rays formed by the specular correspondences and the visual rays cast from the image, a closed form solution is derived for recovering the <b>poses</b> <b>of</b> the reference plane relative to the camera. The shape of the specular surface then follows. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

At the same time, however, he is working on a painting, but leaves its subject matter, as well as his surroundings, to the imagination of the viewer.
