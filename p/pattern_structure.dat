5000|$|In general, {{the defect}} {{propagation}} theory plays {{a bigger role}} at low sediment transport rates since for high rates defects maybe washed away and bedforms generally initiated across the entire bed spontaneously. Venditti et al. (2005) report that instantaneous initiation begins {{with the formation of}} a cross-hatch pattern, which leads to chevron-shaped forms that migrate independently of the <b>pattern</b> <b>structure.</b> This chevron-like structure reorganizes to form the future crest lines of the bedforms. Venditti et al. (2006), based on the earlier model by Liu (1957), proposed that instantaneous initiation is a manifestation of an interfacial hydrodynamic instability of Kelvin-Helmholtz type between a highly active pseudofluid sediment layer and the fluid above it. In addition, Venditti et al. (2005) imply that there is no linkage between the instantaneous initiation and coherent turbulent flow structures, since spatially- and temporally-random events should lock in place to generate the cross-hatch pattern. Moreover, there is no clear explanation of the effect of turbulence in the formation of bedforms since bedforms may also occur under laminar flows [...] It is important to note, that laminar-generated bedform studies used the temporally-averaged flow conditions to determine the degree of turbulence, indicating Reynolds number in the laminar regime. However, instantaneous process, such as burst and sweeps, which are infrequent at low Reynolds number but still present, can be the driving mechanisms to generate the bedforms. The generation of bedforms in laminar flows is still a topic of debate within the scientific community, since if true, it suggests that there should be other processes for defect development other than the one suggested by Best (1992). This alternative model for bedform development at low sediment transport rates should explain the generation of defects and bedforms for cases where the flow is not turbulent.|$|E

The dislocation (strain) network existing in Pt/MgO {{is used as}} a template whose pattern is transferred to AgCo phase in spinodal decomposition, resulting in regular arrays of Co islands that are attracted by the dislocations. The influence of various factors, such as component concentration and film thickness, is studied.

40|$|Several topics {{concerning}} the imaging properties of patterned multilayer mask structures are addressed. Using the split-step beam propagation method {{in conjunction with}} linear systems theory, the reflected electric field from a patterned multilayer structure is calculated. This calculation accounts for the finite thickness of the <b>pattern</b> <b>structure</b> and the angular dependence of the multilayer reflector. A coherence mapping relationship is developed for a patterned multilayer structure placed in the object plane of an optical system. It is shown that both the spatial period of the <b>pattern</b> <b>structure</b> {{as well as the}} angular dependence of the multilayer reflector determines when a simulation must include angular dependence in the coherence mapping. If the illumination system is non-telecentric, a spatially dependent variation of the image irradiance occurs over the field of view of the optical system. A source with a finite spectral bandwidth causes a substantial irradiance decrease in the final image, due to the spectral dependence of the multilayer structure. In an effort to analyze the effects of roughness in short-wavelength imaging systems, the theory of speckle in partially coherent imaging systems is expanded to include the effects of a <b>pattern</b> <b>structure,</b> as well as imaging system aberrations. Including a <b>pattern</b> <b>structure</b> causes the partially developed speckle to manifest itself as a line edge roughness (LER) in images printed in a binary photoresist. It is shown that the LER can increase as the system becomes more incoherent. It is also shown that defocus causes LER produced in the image plane to dramatically increase. An iterative algorithm is developed to calculate the reflected electric field from a rough multilayer structure, which uses no first-order phase approximation and includes the effects of diffraction within the structure. The iterative algorithm is used with the coherence theory developed in this dissertation to analyze the imaging properties of a patterned multilayer structure. Including the effects of the multilayer structure and the thick pattern in the simulation results in an increase in LER, a slight shift in the ideal focus position and an asymmetry in LER for off-axis illumination...|$|E
