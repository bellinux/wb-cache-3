Data are drawn from a sample of 3756 Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) listed manufacturing companies from 1997 to 2012. Findings from the empirically analysis indicate that residual income model is better than free cash flow to equity model under income oriented valuation model, whereas both <b>Price</b> <b>to</b> earnings multiple and <b>Price</b> <b>to</b> book value multiple are superior <b>to</b> <b>Price</b> <b>to</b> sales multiple and are equally likely under market oriented valuation model.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1749, Benning Wentworth, New Hampshire's governor, was selling land grants {{in the area}} west of the Connecticut River, to which New Hampshire had always laid {{somewhat}} dubious claim. Many of these grants were sold at relatively low <b>prices</b> <b>to</b> land speculators, with some land kicked back to Wentworth. In 1764, King George issued an order resolving the competing claims of New York and New Hampshire in favor of New York. New York, which had also issued land grants that overlapped some of those sold by Wentworth, insisted that holders of the Wentworth grants pay a fee to New York to have their grants validated. As this fee approached the original purchase price, {{and many of the}} holders were land-rich and cash-poor, {{there was a great deal}} of resistance to this demand. By 1769 the situation in the Grants had deteriorated to the point where surveyors and other figures of New York authority were being physically threatened and driven from the area.|$|E
5|$|As in all {{occupied}} {{countries in}} Europe, food, fuel and clothing were strictly rationed by the German authorities. Even with the stringent rationing, {{the food and}} materials which civilians should officially have been entitled to were not always available. A significant black market also existed in the country, supplying food illegally at very high <b>prices</b> <b>to</b> those that could afford it. Information and the press were strictly controlled by the German government and news was greatly restricted. Nevertheless, the sales of collaborationist newspapers like Le Soir and the newspapers of pro-collaborationist political parties like Le Pays Réel remained high. A large number of underground newspapers were also published and distributed – the underground paper La Libre Belgique achieved a circulation of 30,000.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1978, {{the economy}} of Côte d'Ivoire {{experienced}} a serious decline due to the sharp downturn in international market prices of coffee and cocoa. The decline was perceived as fleeting, since its impact on planters was buffered by the Caistab, the agricultural marketing board, which ensured them a livable income. The next year, in order to contain a sudden drop in the prices of exported goods, Houphouët-Boigny raised <b>prices</b> <b>to</b> resist international tariffs on raw materials. However, by applying only this solution, Côte d'Ivoire lost more than 700billion CFA francs between 1980 and 1982. From 1983 to 1984, Côte d'Ivoire fell victim to a drought that ravaged nearly 400,000 hectares of forest and 250,000 hectares of coffee and cocoa plants. To address this problem, Houphouët-Boigny travelled to London to negotiate an agreement on coffee and cocoa prices with traders and industrialists; by 1984, the agreement had fallen apart and Côte d'Ivoire was engulfed in a major financial crisis.|$|E

40|$|Investment analysts {{often used}} equity {{valuation}} multiples {{to assess the}} performance of stocks in relation to likely future return to shareholders. Valuation multiples used by analysts are <b>price</b> <b>to</b> earnings, <b>price</b> <b>to</b> book value, <b>price</b> <b>to</b> cash flow and <b>price</b> <b>to</b> sales multiples. However, researchers have argued that correlation exists between the multiples hence assessing them individually and later merging them to one multiple results to reduplication. This study employed the principal component analysis (PCA) method to condense the four equity valuation multiples (EVM) of 223 randomly selected listed firms in Malaysia {{for the period of}} 2008 - 2013. The PCA result reveals that three (3) components explained 99 % of the total variables variance. Suggesting that, the three components (<b>price</b> <b>to</b> earnings, <b>price</b> <b>to</b> book value and <b>price</b> <b>to</b> cash flow multiples) can satisfactorily explain all the EVMs. The implication is that strong correlation exists between EVMs of Malaysian firms. Therefore, the study recommends the application of principal component analysis methodology in the analysis of the equity valuation multiples because of correlation that exists between the valuation multiples. The study is limited to EVMs, entity valuations are not covered in the study. Applying PCA to equity valuation multiples ensures accuracy and reliability of result interpretation due to absence of multicolearity in the decomposed principal component...|$|R

5|$|By mid-1974, Australia {{was in an}} {{economic}} slump, suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and 1973–75 recession. The 1973 oil crisis had caused <b>prices</b> <b>to</b> spike and, according to government figures, inflation topped 13percent {{for over a year}} between 1973 and 1974. Part of the inflation was due to Whitlam's desire to increase wages and conditions of the Commonwealth Public Service as a pacesetter for the private sector. The Whitlam government had cut tariffs by 25percent in 1973; 1974 saw an increase in imports of 30percent and a $1.5billion increase in the trade deficit. Primary producers of commodities such as beef were caught in a credit squeeze as short-term rates rose to extremely high levels. Unemployment also rose significantly. Unease within the ALP led to Barnard's defeat when Jim Cairns challenged him for his deputy leadership.
