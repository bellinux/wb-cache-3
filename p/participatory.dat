5|$|García Márquez {{was also}} noted for leaving out {{seemingly}} important details and events so {{the reader is}} forced into a more <b>participatory</b> role in the story development. For example, in No One Writes to the Colonel, the main characters are not given names. This practice is influenced by Greek tragedies, such as Antigone and Oedipus Rex, in which important events occur off-stage and are left to the audience's imagination.|$|E

The first full <b>participatory</b> budgeting process was developed in the city starting in 1989. <b>Participatory</b> budgeting in its most meaningful form took place in the city from 1991 to 2004. <b>Participatory</b> budgeting was part of a number of innovative reform programs to overcome severe inequality in living standards amongst city residents. One third of the city's residents lived in isolated slums at the city outskirts, lacking access to public amenities (water, sanitation, health care facilities, and schools).|$|E

25|$|Illiteracy {{is both an}} {{important}} cause, and {{an important}} effect, of chronic global poverty. Improvements in livelihoods and access to services in rural communities depends {{on their ability to}} manage local organizations, or hold external ones accountable. The processes of development can also be undermined by educated agents of development whose 'deeply interiorized literacy' informs their decisions. In recent years this has begun to change, with methods of engagement with oral communities that have emphasized participation, voice, and other development methods like <b>participatory</b> rural appraisal, <b>participatory</b> action research and Farmer Field Schools.|$|E
