50|$|While neurons are {{typically}} studied by the extracellular use of metal electrodes, retinal ganglion cells are specifically studied in vitro. This method allows parasol cells' complicated and intertwined structure {{to be analyzed}} intracellularly. In 1941, Polyak was the first scientist to use Golgi staining to identify retinal ganglion cells. Here, dendritic morphology was closely analyzed and revealed large dendritic trees. Later in 1986, Kaplan and Shapley were then the first researchers to link parasol cells with the visual system.

50|$|Both old and {{new world}} {{primates}} {{have been used as}} model systems for human vision and have subsequently been beneficial in researching parasol cells. Many retrograde labeling experiments using macaques, for example, have linked parasol and midget retinal ganglion cells with the magnocellular and parvocellular pathways respectively. In addition, similar studies have led to theories underlying color opponency. Research by Dacey (1996) supports this idea where in vitro primate retinal cells were treated with dye fillings. Parasol cells of the magnocellular pathway were found to be achromatic. In other studies, new world monkeys, such as marmosets, have aided in the current understanding of spatial and temporal frequency of the magnocellular layer in the LGN. Using the Nissl staining method, the magnocellular layer, in addition to the <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layer,</b> have darker and more dense cell bodies than the koniocellular layers, for example.|$|E
40|$|The {{lateral geniculate nucleus}} (LGN) of catarrhine {{primates}} - {{with the}} exception of gibbons - is typically described as a 6 -layered structure, comprised of 2 ventral magnocellular layers, and 4 dorsal <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layers.</b> The <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layers</b> of the LGN are involved in color vision. Therefore, it is hypothesized that a 6 -layered LGN is a shared-derived trait among catarrhines. This might suggest that in gibbons the lack of further subdivisions of the <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layers</b> is a recent change, and could be related to specializations of visual information processing in this taxon. To address these hypotheses, the lamination of the LGN was investigated in a range of catarrhine species, including several taxa not previously described, and the evolution of the LGN was reconstructed using phylogenetic information. The findings indicate that while all catarrhine species have 4 parvocellular leaflets, two main patterns of LGN parvocellular lamination occur: 2 undivided <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layers</b> in some species, and 4 parvocellular leaflets (with occasional subleaflets) in other species. LGN size was not found to be related to lamination pattern. Both patterns were found to occur in divergent clades, which is suggestive of homoplasy within the catarrhines in LGN morphology...|$|R

40|$|Axonal {{damage is}} found in both acute and chronic lesions of {{multiple}} sclerosis. Direct axon counting in post-mortem tissue has suggested that smaller axons might have a greater susceptibility to damage, but methodological limitations have precluded unequivocal interpretation. However, as neuronal and axonal sizes are linked and neuronal changes would be expected with retrograde or transsynaptic degeneration following axon injury, we hypothesized that an alternative strategy for studying this phenomenon would be to define multiple sclerosis-associated changes in neurones. To test this hypothesis, we measured both axonal loss and neuronal size changes in the anterior optic pathway [including the optic nerve (ON), optic tract (OT) and lateral geniculate nucleus] of the brains of eight patients who died with multiple sclerosis and in eight control brains. The ONs and OTs in brains from the multiple sclerosis patients showed a trend to smaller mean cross-sectional areas (ON, multiple sclerosis = 6. 84 mm(2), controls = 9. 25 mm(2); and OT, multiple sclerosis = 6. 45 mm(2), controls = 7. 94 mm(2), P = 0. 08) and had reduced axonal densities (ON, multiple sclerosis = 1. 1 x 10 (5) /mm(2), controls = 1. 7 x 10 (5) /mm(2); and OT, multiple sclerosis = 1. 4 x 10 (5) /mm(2), controls = 1. 8 x 10 (5) /mm(2), P = 0. 006). Estimated total axonal counts were reduced by 32 (OT) - 45 % (ON) in the patients relative to controls (ON, multiple sclerosis = 8. 1 x 10 (5) axons, controls = 14. 8 x 10 (5), P = 0. 05; and OT, multiple sclerosis = 9. 1 x 10 (5), controls = 13. 3 x 10 (5), P = 0. 02). The size distributions of the magnocellular cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus were similar for the two groups, but in multiple sclerosis brains the parvocellular cells were significantly smaller (mean sizes: multiple sclerosis = 226 microm(2), controls = 230 microm(2), P < 0. 001) and had a larger variation in size, suggesting {{a greater proportion of}} atrophic neurones. Axon loss in the optic nerves of multiple sclerosis patients correlated strongly with measures of increased dispersion of cell sizes in the <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layer</b> (r = 0. 8, P < 0. 04). These data demonstrate that both atrophy and decreased density contribute to the substantial axonal loss in the anterior visual pathway of these patients. This appears related to a relatively selective atrophy of the smaller neurones of the <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layer</b> in the lateral geniculate nucleus, supporting the hypothesis that smaller axons may be preferentially susceptible to injury in multiple sclerosis...|$|E

Single optic-tract fibers always projected to {{only one of the}} six geniculate layers. The majority of the axons innervating the four parvocellular laminae were red/green opponent color units; their terminations formed cylindrical columns that were perpendicular to the layers. In similar fashion, the geniculate cells in the <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layers</b> were mostly red/green units with narrow, bipolar dendritic fields oriented normal to the laminar borders. The majority of the retinal axons ending in <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layers</b> 6 and 5 were on-center units; nearly all geniculate cells in these two laminae were also on-center neurons. In layers 4 and 3 most terminating optic-tract fibers, as well as the geniculate cells themselves, were off-center units. All axons projecting to the magnocellular layers were broad-band units with spherical terminal arborizations. The magnocellular geniculate neurons, which were also broad band, had extensive spherical dendritic fields that often crossed laminar borders.

Double-labeling using nonradioactive ISH and immunofluorescence revealed that both GAP- 43 and SCG 10 mRNAs were coexpressed with the �-subunit of type II calcium/calmodulindependent protein kinase, indicating that both mRNAs are expressed also in koniocellular neurons in the LGN. We also showed that GABA-immunoreactive neurons in the LGN did not contain GAP- 43 and SCG 10 mRNAs, indicating that neither GAP- 43 nor SCG 10 mRNAs were expressed in inhibitory interneurons in the LGN.

We report here that this difference in luminance contrast gain between M and P cells is maintained at low levels of mean retinal illumination.

In situ hybridization histochemistry was used to localize mRNAs of the genes encoding monkey-specific ∅ 1, α 2, α 4, α 5, β 1, β 2, and γ 2 subunits. The highest levels of expression in the nucleus were for α 1, β 2, and γ 2 subunit transcripts. The levels were substantially higher in the magnocellular than in the <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layers.</b> Alpha- 2, α 4, α 5, and β 1 subunit mRNAs were expressed at much lower levels, and magno- and <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layers</b> had approximately equal levels of expression. Following 4 - or 21 -day periods of monocular deprivation induced by intravitreal injections of tetrodotoxin, levels of the α 1, α 2, α 4, α 5, β 1, and β 2 mRNAs were decreased in the deprived geniculate laminae. Adjacent sections hybridized with probes specific for 67 -kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) mRNA also showed decreased levels of expression in deprived laminae after the 21 -day deprivation period. Levels of γ 2 receptor subunit mRNA were unaffected by monocular deprivation.

40|$|Leber's {{hereditary}} {{optic neuropathy}} (LHON) {{is characterized by}} retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration with the preferential involvement of those forming the papillomacular bundle. The optic nerve is considered the main pathological target for LHON. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} possible involvement of the post-geniculate visual pathway in LHON patients. We used diffusion-weighted imaging for in vivo evaluation. Mean diffusivity maps from 22 LHON visually impaired, 11 unaffected LHON mutation carriers and 22 healthy subjects were generated and compared at level of optic radiation (OR). Prefrontal and cerebellar white matter were also analyzed as internal controls. Furthermore, we studied the optic nerve and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in post-mortem specimens obtained from a severe case of LHON compared to an age-matched control. Mean diffusivity values of affected patients were higher than unaffected mutation carriers (P< 0. 05) and healthy subjects (P< 0. 01) in OR and not in the other brain regions. Increased OR diffusivity was associated with both disease duration (B =  0. 002; P< 0. 05) and lack of recovery of visual acuity (B =  0. 060; P< 0. 01). Post-mortem investigation detected atrophy (41. 9 % decrease of neuron soma size in the magnocellular layers and 44. 7 % decrease in the <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layers)</b> and, to a lesser extent, degeneration (28. 5 % decrease of neuron density in the magnocellular layers and 28. 7 % decrease in the <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layers)</b> in the LHON LGN associated with extremely severe axonal loss (99 %) in the optic nerve.

Clinical and Experimental Optometry © 2012 Optometrists Association AustraliaThe {{research}} outputs in {{this collection}} have been funded {{in whole or in}} part by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). In this paper, we review the path taken by signals originating from the short wavelength sensitive cones (S-cones) in Old World and New World primates. Two types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) carrying S-cone signals (blue-On and blue-Off cells) project to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) in the thalamus. In all primates, these S-cone signals are relayed through the 'dust-like' (konis in classical Greek) dLGN cells. In New World primates such as common marmoset, these very small cells are known to form distinct and spatially extensive, koniocellular layers. Although in Old World primates, such as macaques, koniocellular layers tend to be very thin, the adjacent <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layers</b> contain distinct koniocellular extensions. It appears that all S-cone signals are relayed through such konio cells, whether they are in the main koniocellular layers or in their colonies within the <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layers</b> of the dLGN. In the primary visual cortex, these signals begin to merge with the signals carried by the other two principal parallel channels, namely the magnocellular and parvocellular channels. This article will also review the possible routes taken by the S-cone signals to reach one of the topographically organised extrastriate visual cortical areas, the middle temporal area (area MT). This area is the major conduit for signals reaching the parietal cortex. Alternative visual inputs to area MT not relayed via the primary visual cortex area (V 1) may provide the neurological basis for the phenomenon of 'blindsight' observed in human and non-human primates, who have partial or complete damage to the primary visual cortex. Short wavelength sensitive cone (S-cone) signals to area MT may also play a role in directing visual attention with possible implications for understanding the pathology in dyslexia and some of its treatment options.

Labels were found in both subdivisions of the LGb: the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (DLGn) and the pregeniculate nucleus (PGn). In particular, part of the visual cortical region adjacent to the middle temporal area (MT) projects into the DLGn as well as the PGn, whereas the MT itself and the superior temporal polysensory region project into the PGn only. Afferents to the DLGn terminate in the magnocellular layers and in their adjoining interlaminar zones, completely sparing the <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layers.</b> Afferents to the PGn terminate in separate regions of this nucleus; the MT and adjacent visual cortices project into the internal layer of the PGn, whereas the polysensosy region of the STs projects into the external retinorecipient layer of the PGn. Possible functional implications of these projections are discussed...|$|R
50|$|One theory {{suggests}} that temporal-frequency processing in the magnocellular pathway, an anatomical pathway that originates in the retina, goes through the lateral geniculate nucleus, and ends in the primary visual cortex, may {{be connected to the}} appearance of this illusion (Skottun and Skoyles debated this link in 2006). The magnocellular pathway is contrast-sensitive, sensitive to motion, and also sensitive to flashing black-to-white edges. Livingstone and Hubel looked at lateral geniculate cells in both the magno- and <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layers,</b> and found responses to luminance contrasts to be much stronger in magnocellular cells. These cells also had better spatial and temporal resolution. Additionally, the magnocelluar pathway is activated more by peripheral vision, in contrast to the parvocelluar pathway, which is activated more by central vision. Rogers-Ramachandran and Ramachandran tested whether or not this preference for peripheral stimuli in the magnocellular cells would have an effect on phantom contour perception. As was predicted, sparsely spaced objects, which degrade the perception of the contours in central vision, were more easily perceived when subjects adjusted their fixation from 0 to 5 degrees eccentricity. This supports the idea that magnocellular cells are responsible for phantom contour perception under such conditions.|$|R
40|$|Numerous highly angled {{electrode}} penetrations {{through the}} opercular region of macaque striate cortex reveal that layers 4 A, 4 C!a, and 4 CP-the primary input sublaminae for axons from the {{lateral geniculate nucleus}} (LGN) -are retinotopically organized on a fine scale and populated mostly by monocularly driven cells having small receptive fields and lacking orientation selectivity. Layer 4 B, which does not receive a direct thalamic input, contains orientationally selective cells, {{and many of these}} are also direction selective. To a significant degree the response properties of cells in layers 4 Ccu and 4 C/ 3 reflect the response properties of their respective afferent inputs, from the magnoand parvocellular laminae of the LGN. Accordingly, cells in layer 4 Ca have lower contrast thresholds and larger minimum response fields than do the cells in layer 4 C @ In contrast to this clear-cut separation, the cells of layer 4 A (whose major source of direct LGN input arises from the <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layers)</b> exhibit both high and low contrast thresholds. With regard to the precision of retinotopic mapping that is seen in lamina 4 C, it is noteworthy that there is substantial overlap among the minimum response fields of neighboring neurons. Due to a larger mean receptive field size, this overlap is greater in layer 4 Ca than it is in 4 Cp. In either sublamina, however, th...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} several {{components of the}} human visual system {{to determine how the}} dimensions of the optic tract, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and primary visual cortex (V 1) vary within the same brain. Measurements were made of the cross-sectional area of the optic tract, the volumes of the magnocellular and <b>parvocellular</b> <b>layers</b> of the LGN, and the surface area and volume of V 1 in one or both cerebral hemi-spheres of 15 neurologically normal human brains obtained at autopsy. Consistent with previous observations, there was a two- to threefold variation in the size of each of these visual components among the individuals studied. Importantly, this variation was coordinated within the visual system of any one individual. That is, a relatively large V 1 was associated with a commensurately large LGN and optic tract, whereas a relatively small V 1 was associated with a commensurately smaller LGN and optic tract. This relationship among the components of the human visual system indicates that the development of its different parts is interdependent. Such coordinated variation should generate substantial differences in visual ability among humans. Key words: visual system; primary visual cortex; lateral genic-ulate nucleus; optic tract; allometry; interindividual differences Whether differences in human cognitive ability depend on brain size has been debated without resolution for more than a centur...|$|R
