40|$|The {{chemical}} dealloying of bi-phase Al- 35 Ag alloy {{has been}} investigated within the <b>parting</b> <b>limit.</b> The dealloying of α-Al(Ag) and Ag 2 Al commenced simultaneously, and all α-Al(Ag) and part of Ag 2 Al were dealloyed, leaving residual Ag 2 Al to be dealloyed afterwards. The dealloying of the residual Ag 2 Al is associated with vacancy controlled mechanism and diffusion of Al atoms. It is revealed that the diffusions of the Al and Ag atoms during dealloying are significant. The Ag skeletons formed at the initial stage, and became coarsened gradually with a time dependence of d ∝ t 2 / 5, illustrating the vital role of diffusion of Ag atoms...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the search}} for new {{catalysts}} for the oxygen reduction reaction in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, alloys of Pt with other transition metals are of great interest due to their increased specific and especially mass activity. However, the drawback of these catalysts is their reduced stability due to {{the dissolution of the}} less-noble metal from the alloy. To resolve the potential dependence of these dissolution processes, we investigate a material library of Pt-Cu thin-film alloys with compositions ranging from 0 at% Cu up to 60 at% Cu. Utilizing our combinatorial scanning flow cell technique coupled to a mass spectrometer several aspects of dissolution are revealed. The onset of relevant Cu dissolution was found to be around 0. 9 V$_{RHE}$, independent of the composition. Although this is well below the onset potential of the Pt dissolution (1. 15 V$_{RHE}$), the two dissolution processes are clearly correlated, especially when the surface is already depleted of Cu. In contrast to Pt, however, Cu preferentially dissolves during anodic polarization rather than during the cathodic sweep. Additionally, at Cu compositions above the <b>parting</b> <b>limit</b> between 50 and 57 at% Cu a breakdown of passivity and massive Cu dissolution leads to porosity formation. The critical potential for the alloy with 57 at% Cu was detected around 1. 3 V$_{RHE}$, which is above the stability potential of Pt. While the absolute activity during the porosity formation increases due to the formation of more active sites in the pores, the specific activity decays to a value close to pure Pt...|$|E
40|$|Supercritical CO₂ (scCO₂) is {{emerging}} as a viable and environmentally sustainable platform for nanomaterials synthesis due to its tunable solvent properties combined with low surface tension and viscosity, which allow rapid, non-destructive wetting within small features. However, to advance the utility of this fluid, a more thorough understanding of surface chemistry at high pressures is needed. In this study, the behavior of reactive solids in scCO₂ was examined by etching thin dielectric, metal, and alloy films to determine the fundamental mechanisms controlling the reactions. Models were developed to describe the etching processes and to benchmark scCO₂ with conventional methods. Dielectric SiOₓNy films were etched with an HF/pyridine complex dissolved in scCO₂. The anhydrous etching process resulted in formation of a residual (NH₄) ₂SiF₆ layer that limited transport of reactants to the film and caused a drop in reaction order. Partial removal of the salt was accomplished by sublimation under vacuum. Etching of thin CuO films with hexafluoroacetylacetone (hfacH) in scCO₂ was studied and found to occur via a 3 -step Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction sequence. The kinetic model showed that lower scCO₂ densities favored hfacH adsorption on the CuO surface and that scCO₂ solvation forces lowered the activation barrier for the rate-limiting step. Adding up to 10 × the molar ratio of pure H₂O to hfacH nearly doubled the etching rate through formation of a hydrogen-bonded hfacH complex. Both bulk and thin film AgCu alloys were selectively etched in scCO₂ to generate nanoporous Ag structures. As Cu was preferentially removed through selective oxidation and chelation, the Ag atoms conglomerated into successively larger clusters similar to mechanisms reported in aqueous phase dealloying. Supercritical dealloying was observed at Cu compositions below typical <b>parting</b> <b>limits,</b> suggesting enhanced fluid transport in the evolving pores. When using in situ oxidation, the etching reaction was limited by decomposition of H₂O₂. Inverse space image analysis of samples with initial phase domain sizes between 250 - 1000 nm showed that below a threshold of approximately 500 nm, the dealloyed feature size mimicked the starting microstructure. Larger phase domains prohibited surface diffusion of Ag between phases producing a mixture of large and small Ag nanostructures...|$|R
40|$|Dans cet article, l'auteur tente d'établir, dans une optique européenne avec un regard particulier à la {{situation}} italienne, les liens existant entre le domaine des études des relations industrielles et la science politique. In France {{and elsewhere}} {{much has been}} said about trade-unions and politics. Specialists in labour legislation were interested in the illicit nature of political strike and in the one of trade-union information with political backbone by revealing the flimsy <b>limits</b> <b>parting</b> « politic » from « professional » in union activity. To certain European observers the opposition between political activity and professionnal activity seems futile and false at the same time (Verdier) and conceptually doubtful (Pizzorno). The Industrial Relations Congress of Laval University held on April 30 th and on May 1 st, 1973 laid down the following theme: « Political Orientation of Labour Relations ». The author intends to use additionnal factors, not only about links between labour relations and politics, but between the field of studies on industrial relations and political science. The latter, a matter of crucial importance that D. Carrier wished to become a « valid science of industrial relations », stands at the cross-roads of social sciences. It was therefore interesting to contact the specialists in political science, {{in order to try to}} understand the links between those two disciplines in full development. This opportunity was offered by the bulletin « Le syndicalisme compare » fromRivista italiana di scienza politica, under the direction of Giovani Sartori. He criticizes the excessive pressure of American political economists upon decisions pertaining to political science activity, the way of doing it, likewise he regrets they have left to specialists in industrial relations to look after trade-unions. The writer briefly considere the notions of professors Parsons, Leon Dion, Dunlop and Sartori and praises for a much closer view of the social system and of its elements — the political system as such must be suited explicitly to the economic system and also to the industrial relations system — which determine in a more satisfying way the various interactions and especialy the cross-checks from the field of industrial relations activity with the one of the political system. All that in circumstances under which trade-unions, social partners in an industrial relations system, are on the verge of becoming more thanpressure groups in some European countries, but realpower groups, full timepolitical manoeuvrers, performing under a logic other than the one used in pressure groups. Henceforth trade-unions get directly into the political system as the main object of political activity. Sartori enjoins us to study the compared trade-unionism considered as part and parcel of compared politics. The writer wishes compared trade-unionism to become the aim in forming real specialists in compared industrial relations...|$|R
