Similar effects have been observed in overcrowded situations in jack rabbits and deer.|$|E

25|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} process may be affected by PD, so {{it is common to}} experience constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period of}} time than normal). A balanced diet is recommended to help improve digestion. Diet should include high-fiber foods and <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Levodopa and proteins use the same transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, competing between them for access. When taken together, the consequences of such competition is a reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive proteins are discouraged, while in advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa is recommended to be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch and are usually taken at dinner. As the disease advances, dysphagia may appear. In such cases, specific measures include the use of thickening agents for liquid intake, special postures when eating, and gastrostomy in the worst cases.|$|E

It was directed by Mike Vejar, his fourth episode of the series, although he had also developed several more episodes of the other series in the franchise. Filming on [...] "Marauders" [...] began on August 21, 2002, utilising the standing ship sets. The shoot on the following day mostly took place on a sound stage, while the third day's on set filming used the shuttlepod set as well as a newly created ship's gym set. The remainder of the eight days filming took place on location at a quarry in Ventura County, California, located about an hour's journey north west of Los Angeles. Temperatures were mild for that time of year, but the actors were still told to wear sunscreen and drink <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The actors portraying the Klingons joined on the second of the five days on location, with the majority of them played by stunt men. According to Bakula, the set used for the colony was the largest build so far for Enterprise.|$|E

2500|$|In 1869, a {{group of}} local {{businessmen}} pooled their resources to create the [...] Lake View Cemetery straddling the Cleveland-Cleveland Heights border on Cleveland's east side.

Forty percent of all burials at Lake View Cemetery in 1869 were reinterments from Woodland Cemetery. Although publicly-owned cemeteries like Woodland and Highland Park Cemetery remained popular with the poor and working class (who could afford its inexpensive burial plots), Lake View Cemetery became the cemetery of choice of the middle class and wealthy.

2500|$|The Joseon Government {{recognized}} Gwon's heroics, {{and named}} him the new {{governor of the}} Jeolla province in the following year.

After the battle, the Joseon government ordered Gwon to march northward and combat the Japanese in Seoul.|$|E
2500|$|Marrakesh {{served as}} {{the capital of the}} vast Almoravid empire, which {{stretched}} over all of Morocco, western Algeria and southern Spain (al-Andalus). [...] Because of the barrenness of its surroundings, Marrakesh remained merely a political and administrative capital under the Almoravids, never quite displacing bustling Aghmat, just thirty kilometres away, as a commercial or scholarly center. This began to change under the Almoravid emir Ali ibn Yusuf (r.1106-1142) ("Ben Youssef"), who launched a construction program to give Marrakesh a grander feel. Ali ibn Yusuf erected a new magnificent palace, along Andalusian design, on the western side of the city, connected by a corridor to the old Qasr al-Hajar armory. [...] More importantly, he introduced a new system of waterworks, via cisterns and khettaras (gravity-driven underground canals) designed by his engineer Abd Allah ibn Yunus al-Muhandis, that could supply the entire city with <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and thus support a larger urban population. Ibn Yusuf also built several monumental ablution fountains and a grand new mosque, the Masjid al-Siqaya (the first Ben Youssef Mosque), the largest mosque built in the Almoravid empire. [...] The new mosque and the surrounding markets (souqs), were set to form the center of urban life. [...] The rest of the fledlging city was organized into neighborhoods, cut across by two grand street axes, connecting four monumental gates: Bab al-Khamis (north), Bab Aghmat (SE) and Bab Dukkala (NW) and the Bab al-Nfis (SW).|$|E
