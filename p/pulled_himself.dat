5|$|On December 27, 1977, {{just two}} weeks after the incident, Washington was traded to the Boston Celtics. Red Auerbach, Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a {{longtime}} fan of Washington's. Pat stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel. While he waited for his reinstatement, which he thought would not occur until the next season, he became depressed and fell out of shape. He <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> together, and began {{running up and down the}} flights of stairs of the 29-story hotel.|$|E
5|$|Crush {{attacked}} Doink the Clown {{outside the}} ring {{prior to the}} next match. After getting Doink inside the ring, Crush used his strength advantage to overpower Doink. Doink gained the advantage but missed two attacks from the top rope. Crush used more power moves to wear down Doink, and Doink tried to crawl under the ring. Crush forced Doink back into the ring and performed the Cranium Crunch, a head vice submission hold, on Doink. Doink <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> to the ropes and broke the hold. Doink hit the referee and knocked him unconscious; {{as a result of}} this staged ref bump, a second Doink the Clown (portrayed by Steve Keirn) was able to interfere. He hit Crush with a prosthetic arm, which enabled the first Doink to win by pinfall when the referee regained consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Luongo {{made his}} third {{appearance}} at the World Championships in 2004 in the Czech Republic. He played in seven games as the starting goaltender, recording a 2.32 GAA and one shutout, as Canada captured its second straight {{gold medal at the}} tournament, beating Sweden 5–3 in the final. Several months later, Luongo competed for Team Canada in the 2004 World Cup as backup to Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils. It marked Luongo's first international tournament in which all NHL players were eligible, as the annual World Championships conflict with the Stanley Cup playoffs. He had another opportunity to step in for the starting goalie when Brodeur <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> out prior to the semi-final game against the Czech Republic due to a sprained wrist. Filling in for Brodeur, Luongo made 37 of 40 stops in a 4–3 overtime victory to put Team Canada into the finals against Finland. Brodeur returned for the championship game to backstop Team Canada to a 3–2 win.|$|E

25|$|Hooper first {{announced}} his shocking retirement {{three weeks before}} the 1999 Cricket World Cup but made a surprising comeback in 2001 and captained the West Indies team in 2003 Cricket World Cup. West Indies failed to progress to the second round after some miserable performances {{in the first round of}} tournament. Despite that, Hooper was retained in the side but this time, he <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> back and finally retired from the game as he wanted a youngster in the team instead of him.|$|E
25|$|On 20 October 1897, {{an attempt}} by a British force to take the {{strongly}} held Dargai Heights was beaten back, leaving three battalions pinned down under heavy fire from above and unable to withdraw. They were reinforced by the 1st Gordons, who were ordered to advance through the open ground and storm the heights, led by their five pipers. Findlater was wounded before reaching the hillside, with a superficial wound to his left foot and a broken right ankle. Unable to walk, he <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> to a boulder, propped himself up, and continued to play to encourage the advance. The infantry following behind successfully reached the hillside, climbed the heights, and dispersed the defenders.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} courageous efforts at the SCG was John Sattler's {{performance}} in the 1970 grand final between South Sydney and the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. In the first ten minutes of the game, South's captain Sattler had his jaw broken by a punch from Manly forward John Bucknall in an off-the-ball incident. Sattler went down but <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> up on teammate Michael Cleary, asking the winger to help him so that the other players would not know he was hurt. In an act of supreme courage Sattler played on, refusing treatment at half time and pleas from teammates {{not to take the}} field again, to lead Souths to a famous 23–12 win. It was not until well after the game that he went to hospital. The Australian side to tour Britain was selected that night and, but for his injury, Sattler would have been picked as captain.|$|E

500|$|In July 2007, Trescothick {{was named}} in the {{preliminary}} squad for the Twenty20 World Championship in South Africa, with the full squad to be confirmed on 11 August. However, Trescothick <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> out of the squad before the final confirmation date, stating that [...] " [...] now clear that I should take more time to complete my recovery". The England selectors confirmed that they remained in favour of including Trescothick at some point, looking [...] "forward to his making himself available again for England {{when the time is}} right". Trescothick, however, said that he knows England cannot wait for him forever, and on 10 September 2007 he went into his second year without an England contract.|$|E
500|$|Aronofsky had {{the idea}} for The Wrestler for over a decade. He hired Robert D. Siegal to turn his idea into a script. The actor Nicolas Cage entered {{negotiations}} in October 2007 to star as Randy, the film's protagonist. The following month Cage left the project, and Mickey Rourke replaced him in the lead role. Aronofsky said that Cage {{pulled out of the}} movie because Aronofsky wanted Rourke to star; Aronofsky said, stating that Cage was [...] "a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but, you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> out of the race." [...] Cage responded, [...] "I wasn't quote 'dropped' from the movie. I resigned from the movie because I didn't think I had enough time to achieve the look of the wrestler who was on steroids, which I would never do". The roughly 40-day shoot began in January 2008.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Verschoyle Phillip Cronyn later {{described}} his harrowing return flight. Being the rare targeted pilot to escape Voss's gun fire, he {{now had to}} coax home a failing machine destined for the scrapheap. He lost control of it banking for the landing pattern, and finally performed a desperate high speed landing at 18:40 hours, approximately coincidental with the triplane's impact. The 56 Squadron commander, Major Blomfield, led the shaky-kneed pilot from his machine to a bench and plied him with medicinal brandy. Cronyn's composure broke. After a fit of weeping, he <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> together as McCudden landed, followed by Rhys-Davids. The latter exited his machine hyperventilating and stammering. He got his tot of brandy, and uttered an account jumbled by his excitement. With the exception of Muspratt, who had landed at the 1 Squadron aerodrome with a seized engine, the rest of 56 Squadron landed back at Estrée-Blanche. Combat reports by the pilots were written and submitted; those from McCudden, Rhys-Davids, Bowman, Maybery, Hoidge, and Gardiner still exist. These fragmentary written documents would be supplemented by McCudden's autobiography, written before his death the following year; contradictory written accounts produced by Chidlaw-Roberts and Bowman in 1942; and Cronyn's memoirs of 1976. When corresponding with aviation historian Evan Hadingham in 1967, Cronyn offered, [...] "...movements were purely instinctive, and made on such split second action that no impression was recorded." [...] He offered as example that he was unaware he {{had spent most of}} his fight with Voss flying inverted until Muspratt mentioned it in the mess the evening of the fight.|$|E

500|$|On 3 January 1927, {{following}} a venture out to Gunnamatta Bay, Gibbs was piloting a launch {{back into the}} Grays Point area of Port Hacking when a scream rang out. Gibbs looked up and noticed 15-year-old Mervyn Allum struggling in the water about [...] from the shore. Subsequent reports indicate that the other bathers first thought that Allum, who {{was known to be}} a good swimmer, was drowning. Gibbs, however, quickly realised that the youth's leg had been grabbed by a shark. Gibbs immediately dived into the water and swam towards the scene to render Allum assistance, as the latter struggled to fend off the shark. By now the water was red with blood. As Gibbs grabbed for Allum, the teenager was pulled under water. Gibbs had to strike at the shark with his legs and fists and grasp its dorsal fin before the shark would release its grip. While Gibbs' friend, Donald Campbell, rowed a boat towards the pair, Gibbs maintained a hold on the now unconscious Allum, trod water, and splashed to discourage further attacks. The shark continued to circle below during this time, at one point brushing past Gibbs' feet. As Campbell drew near, he and Gibbs managed to lift Allum aboard before Gibbs <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> clear of the water. Gibbs later reported that the flesh had been stripped from the ankle to the thigh on one of Allum's legs, and there was evidence of teeth and bite marks to Allum's hands and stomach; Allum was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital.|$|E
500|$|However, in the 1968–69 season, Russell {{seemed to}} reach a {{breaking}} point. Shocked by the murder of Robert F. Kennedy, disillusioned by the Vietnam War, and weary from his increasingly stale (and later divorced) marriage to his wife Rose, {{he was convinced that}} the U.S. was a corrupt nation and that he was wasting his time playing something as superficial as basketball. He was 15 pounds overweight, skipped mandatory NBA coach meetings and was generally lacking energy: after a New York Knicks game, he complained of intense pain and was diagnosed with acute exhaustion. Russell <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> together and put up 9.9 points and 19.3 rebounds per game, but the aging Celtics stumbled through the regular season. Their 48–34 record was the team's worst since 1955–56, and they entered the playoffs as only the fourth-seeded team in the East. In the playoffs, however, Russell and his Celtics achieved upsets over the Philadelphia 76ers and New York Knicks to earn a meeting with the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals. L.A. now featured new recruit Wilt Chamberlain next to perennial stars Baylor and West, and were heavily favored. In the first two games, Russell ordered not to double-team West, who used the freedom to score 53 and 41 points in the Game 1 and 2 Laker wins. Russell then ordered to double-team West, and Boston won Game 3. In Game 4, the Celtics were trailing by one point with seven seconds left and the Lakers having the ball, but then Baylor stepped out of bounds, and in the last play, Sam Jones used a triple screen by Bailey Howell, Larry Siegfried and Havlicek and hit a buzzer beater which equalized the series. The teams split the next two games, so it all came down to Game 7 in L.A., where Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke angered and motivated the Celtics by putting [...] "proceedings of Lakers victory ceremony" [...] on the game leaflets. Russell used a copy as extra motivation and told his team to play a running game, because in that case, not the better, but the more determined team was going to win.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the fore}} {{part of the}} ship dipped below the surface and the water rushed towards them, Gracie jumped with the wave, caught a handhold, and <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> {{up to the roof}} of the bridge. The {{undertow}} caused by the ship's sinking pulled Gracie down; he freed himself from the ship and rose to the surface near the overturned Collapsible [...] "B". Gracie scrambled onto the overturned lifeboat along with a few dozen other men in the water. His friend Clinch Smith disappeared; his remains were never found. In his memoir, Gracie surmises Smith became entangled with the ropes and other debris on the ship, and could not free himself.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{the vehicle}} stop {{several times to}} load more wounded onto it, Libby {{continued}} to fire his M2 Carbine at the North Koreans they encountered as they attempted to escape. Libby was struck {{several times in the}} body and arms by bullets as they broke through the first roadblock. At a second roadblock, Libby was struck again by [...] gunfire. Too weak to hold his weapon, Libby <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> to an erect position in order to be a human shield for the driver until they were out of the range of enemy fire. Libby eventually collapsed and died from blood loss, but his actions allowed the truck full of wounded men to reach safety.|$|E
2500|$|The Wrestler {{was written}} by Robert D. Siegel, a former writer for The Onion, and entered {{development}} at director Darren Aronofsky's Protozoa Pictures.

2500|$|In 1897, Professor William Libbey from Princeton University climbed Enchanted Mesa to {{disprove}} {{the existence of}} ruins. [...] His team used a cannon to shoot a rope over {{the end of the}} butte and using a pulley <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> up in a marine life-saving chair. [...] Libbey and a newspaperman climbed to the top, spent two to three hours exploring, and returned empty-handed. Libbey announced that he had seen no ruins or artifacts, saying [...] "Romantic Indian legend can never stand the acid test of scientific investigation." [...] Self-educated archaeologist Frederick Webb Hodge did not take Libbey's word for it. On a later 1897 expedition he reported evidence of occupation. [...] Although the main ruins had been washed over the edge by centuries of thunderstorms, he found plenty of arrow points, stone tools, beads and pottery fragments lodged in crevices.|$|E
