2500|$|In {{patients}} with other pacing modes, other than ventricular pacing, symptoms usually resolve after adjusting and reprogramming of pacemaker parameters, such as tuning the AV delay, changing the postventricular atrial refractory period, the sensing level, and <b>pacing</b> threshold <b>voltage.</b> The optimal values of these parameters {{for each individual}} differ. So, achieving the optimal values is by experimenting with successive reprogramming and measurement of [...] parameters, such as blood pressure, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance, as well as observations of symptomatology.|$|R
40|$|Beat-by-beat Autocapture is {{currently}} limited to {{operation in the}} ventricle with bipolar leads. The authors investigated the integral of the negative-going portion of the atrial evoked response integral (AERI) as a potential resource for verification of atrial capture. Intracardiac electrogram signals were collected from 59 patients (ages 67. 8 +/- 15. 1 years) with bipolar, low polarization atrial leads. The signals were collected over a mean period of 6. 1 months (minimum 4 days) after lead implantation. St. Jude Medical Affinity pulse generators were used to perform automatic capture threshold tests while the electrogram signals were recorded by a Model 3510 programming device. These signals were transferred to a personal computer in digital form for later analysis. The AERI was calculated at each programmable <b>pacing</b> <b>voltage</b> until capture was lost. The difference between the polarization integral at loss of capture and evoked response integral with successful capture was sufficient to justify enabling the atrial Autocapture feature in 53 of 59 patients in whom bipolar pacing and unipolar sensing was performed. The authors developed a calibration routine to identify automatically those patients in whom atrial Autocapture could be programmed On, based on the polarization integral at loss of capture, the estimated maximum polarization integral, and the AERI. Preliminary analysis indicated that the AERI is a practical resource for beat-by-beat atrial capture detection when used with low polarization leads...|$|R
40|$|Phrenic nerve {{stimulation}} (PNS) could be prevented by a silastic patch over the epicardial lead. We studied the effects in preventing PNS {{by placing a}} silastic patch directly over an epicardial lead or placing a graft around the phrenic nerve (PN). Fourteen Lanyu swine were enrolled. A bipolar lead was placed epicardially on the left ventricle (LV) inferior to the PN. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) lead was placed into the right ventricle (RV). The maximal influential distance (MID) was measured under 3 pacing configurations to express the influential electrical field on the PN. The threshold of the LV and PN were evaluated epicardially. Then, PTFE patches of different sizes (10 × 10 mm, 20 × 20 mm and 30 × 30 mm) were placed between the LV lead and PN to study the rise in PN threshold in 7 swine. On the other hand, the PN were surrounded by a PTFE graft of different lengths (10 mm, 20 mm, and 30 mm) in the remaining 7 swine. LV-bipolar pacing showed the shortest MID {{when compared to the}} other 2 unipolar pacing configurations at <b>pacing</b> <b>voltage</b> of 10 V. The patch was most effective in preventing PNS during LV-bipolar pacing. PNS was prevented under all circumstances with a larger PTFE patch (30 × 30 mm) or long graft (30 mm). PNS was avoided by placing a PTFE patch over the LV lead or a graft around the PN despite pacing configurations. Hence if PNS persisted during CRT implantation, a PTFE patch on the LV lead or a graft around the PN could be considered...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the proposed overhead Catenoid Lightning Protection System (CLPS) is personnel safety. To ensure working personnel's safety in lightning situations, {{it is necessary that}} the potential difference developed across a distance equal to a person's <b>pace</b> (step <b>voltage)</b> does not exceed a separately established safe voltage in order to avoid electrocution (ventricular fibrillation) of humans. Therefore, the first stage of the analytical effort is to calculate the open circuit step voltage. An impedance model is developed for this purpose. It takes into consideration the earth's complex impedance behavior and the transient nature of the lightning phenomenon. In the low frequency limit, this impedance model is shown to reduce to results similar to those predicted by the conventional resistor model in a DC analysis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cardiovascular {{magnetic}} resonance (CMR) yields important clinical informa-tion which often cannot {{be obtained from}} other imaging modalities. Cardiac pacemakers have conventionally been considered a contraindication to CMR, and relatively few data exist on CMR in such patients. Methods and results: We present 5 patients who underwent 6 CMR scans in a 0. 5 Tesla scanner. The patients were non-pacemaker dependent, and the pacemakers were reprogrammed prior to scanning to have sub-threshold output. Spin echo, gradient echo and real-time sequences were used with specific absorption rates of up to 0. 1 W/kg. A cardiologist was present during each scan, and the patient had continuous electrocardiographic and non-invasive monitoring of vital signs. Five of the scans were carried out without incident providing useful diagnostic information, which was not compromised by obvious artifact from the pace-maker box. In one case, the pacemaker began <b>pacing</b> at maximum <b>voltage</b> at a fixed rate of 100. This patient {{was removed from the}} magnet, and there were no clinical sequelae. The mean pre-and post-scan ventricular lead voltage threshold was the same (2. 28 V vs 2. 28 V). Conclusion: Our experience is that CMR at 0. 5 T in non-pacemaker dependent patents can be performed in closely supervised circumstances where the benefit-risk assessment is considered positive...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{mathematical}} model of calcium cycling {{that takes into account}} the spatially localized nature of release events that correspond to experimentally observed calcium sparks. This model naturally incorporates graded release by making the rate at which calcium sparks are recruited proportional to the whole cell L-type calcium current, with the total release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) being just the sum of local releases. The dynamics of calcium cycling is studied by pacing the model with a clamped action potential waveform. Experimentally observed calcium alternans are obtained at high pacing rates. The results show that the underlying mechanism for this phenomenon is a steep nonlinear dependence of the calcium released from the SR on the diastolic SR calcium concentration (SR load) and/or the diastolic calcium level in the cytosol, where the dependence on diastolic calcium is due to calcium-induced inactivation of the L-type calcium current. In addition, the results reveal that the calcium dynamics can become chaotic even though the <b>voltage</b> <b>pacing</b> is periodic. We reduce the equations of the model to a two-dimensional discrete map that relates the SR and cytosolic concentrations at one beat and the previous beat. From this map, we obtain a condition for the onset of calcium alternans in terms of the slopes of the release-versus-SR load and release-versus-diastolic-calcium curves. From an analysis of this map, we also obtain an understanding of the origin of chaotic dynamics...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess whether}} rapid high <b>voltage</b> {{ventricular}} <b>pacing</b> can also induce atrial fibrillation, {{and whether the}} induction of atrial fibrillation during ventricular fibrillation conversion testing {{is related to the}} patient's heart disease.  DESIGN—Prospective study of 50  patients who received the dual chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) Ventak AV II DR (Guidant) as a first implant. This device can record atrial activity even during a ventricular fibrillation episode and can induce atrial fibrillation by rapid atrial bursts.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Frequency of atrial fibrillation after induction of ventricular fibrillation; clinical characteristics of patients with and without induced atrial fibrillation; frequency of atrial fibrillation induced by rapid atrial bursts during predischarge testing.  RESULTS—Atrial fibrillation was observed in 40  of the 217  ventricular fibrillation episodes (18 %) that could be detected immediately after delivery of high <b>voltage</b> <b>pacing.</b> The biphasic ICD shock for termination of ventricular fibrillation also terminated the atrial fibrillation in all cases. The 40  episodes of simultaneous atrial and ventricular fibrillation occurred in 18  patients (36 %). The distribution of the clinical characteristics of the patients and the inducibility of atrial fibrillation during predischarge testing were similar in those with and without induced atrial fibrillation.  CONCLUSIONS—Rapid high <b>voltage</b> ventricular <b>pacing</b> frequently induces atrial fibrillation, which was terminated by the subsequent biphasic ICD shock. The induction of atrial fibrillation seems to be a non-specific phenomenon, unrelated to the clinical status of the patient.    Keywords: dual chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; atrial fibrillation induction; ventricular fibrillation conversion test; high voltage ventricular pacing; atrial burst pacin...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility and safety of a novel technology that uses energy transfer from an ultrasound transmitter to achieve cardiac stimulation without the use of a pacing lead in humans. Background: To overcome the limitations of pacemaker leads, a new technology enabling stimulation without the use of a lead is desirable. Methods: A steerable bipolar electrophysiology catheter incorporating a receiver electrode into the tip and circuitry to convert ultrasound energy to electrical energy was inserted transvenously into the heart. An ultrasound transmitting transducer was placed on the chest wall with ultrasound gel. Ultrasound energy was amplitude-adjusted and transmitted at 313 to 385 kHz. The output waveform of the receiver electrode was monitored while the transmitter was moved on the chest wall to target the receiver. The ultrasound transmission amplitude was limited to a mechanical index of 1. 9, the maximum allowed for ultrasound imaging systems. Ultrasound-mediated <b>pacing</b> with minimum <b>voltage</b> but consistent capture was obtained for 12 s. Results: Twenty-four patients (48 ± 12 years) were tested during or after completion of clinical electrophysiology procedures. A total of 80 pacing sites were tested (mean 3. 3 sites/patient) : 12 right atrial, 35 right ventricular, and 33 left ventricular (31 endocardial) sites. The transmit-to-receive distance was 11. 3 ± 3. 2 cm (range 5. 3 to 22. 5 cm). Ultrasound-mediated pacing was achieved at all 80 test sites, with consistent capture at 77 sites. The mechanical index during pacing was 0. 5 ± 0. 3 (range 0. 1 to 1. 5). The mean ultrasound-mediated capture threshold was 1. 01 ± 0. 64 V. There was no adverse event related to ultrasound pacing. No patient experienced discomfort during pacing.

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{presence}} of a cardiovascular implantable electronic device {{has long been a}} contraindication for the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We established a prospective registry to determine the risks associated with MRI at a magnetic field strength of 1. 5 tesla for patients who had a pacemaker or implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) that was "non-MRI-conditional" (i. e., not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for MRI scanning). METHODS Patients in the registry were referred for clinically indicated nonthoracic MRI at a field strength of 1. 5 tesla. Devices were interrogated before and after MRI {{with the use of a}} standardized protocol and were appropriately reprogrammed before the scanning. The primary end points were death, generator or lead failure, induced arrhythmia, loss of capture, or electrical reset during the scanning. The secondary end points were changes in device settings. RESULTS MRI was performed in 1000 cases in which patients had a pacemaker and in 500 cases in which patients had an ICD. No deaths, lead failures, losses of capture, or ventricular arrhythmias occurred during MRI. One ICD generator could not be interrogated after MRI and required immediate replacement; the device had not been appropriately programmed per protocol before the MRI. We observed six cases of self-terminating atrial fibrillation or flutter and six cases of partial electrical reset. Changes in lead impedance, <b>pacing</b> threshold, battery <b>voltage,</b> and P-wave and R-wave amplitude exceeded prespecified thresholds in a small number of cases. Repeat MRI was not associated with an increase in adverse events. CONCLUSIONS In this study, device or lead failure did not occur in any patient with a non-MRIconditional pacemaker or ICD who underwent clinically indicated nonthoracic MRI at 1. 5 tesla, was appropriately screened, and had the device reprogrammed in accordance with the prespecified protocol...|$|R
