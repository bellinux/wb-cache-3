30|$|During the {{processing}} of solute rich alloys, macrosegregation defects can result from the solidification step [4]. These defects are characterized by composition differences in the space domain {{on the scale of}} the product, which deteriorates the properties of the material.

The improvement of such macrosegregation is a central problem in the solidification process.

Still an adaptation of the LRT Kubo formalism allows the analysis of stirring. The quantum pumping problem (where we have an open geometry) can be regarded as a special limit of the quantum stirring problem (where we have a closed geometry).

40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out {{studying}} diSturbance effects of auger-stirring 11. 3 percent moisture corn with a 51 -mm (2 -in.) diameter stirring auger. Bulk density effects and {{the shape of the}} disturbed volume were defined for auger travel rates from 0 to 10. 3 mm/s (24. 3 in. /min). Kernel orientations inside and outside the disturbed region were compared. Auger <b>stirring</b> <b>devices</b> are in wide use in bin-type corn-drying systems. These devices typically consist of one or more open 51 -mm (2 -in.) diameter, right-hand augers suspended from the bin roof and widewall and extending to near the bin floor. The augers rotate clockwise (viewed from above) and simultaneously travel horizontally. They lift grain from near the bin floor toward the top of the grain mass. H. A. Kalke of Rockford, Iowa was issued United States patent 3, 156, 541 for an auger stirring apparatus he invented during 1959 - 61. An auger <b>stirring</b> <b>device</b> was first commercially marketed in 1962. (Murphy, David M., 1977. Personal communication. David Manufacturing Co., Mason City, IA.) Auger stirrers are used with two kinds of bin-drying systems: the in-storage layer-fill system, in which corn is dried and stored in the same bin to a depth of 5 to 6 m (16 to 20 ft), and the bin-batch system, in which corn is placed for drying and cooling and then is removed to storage. In both these systems, the stirrer offers significant management advantages. A stirrer in an in-storage layer system allows the use of air temperatures as high as 60 °C (140 °F) resulting in faster drying and faster filling. If a <b>stirring</b> <b>device</b> is not used, an air temperature rise greater than about 11 °C (20 °F) may result in moisture contents of less than 10 percent in the bottom layers of corn. Use of a stirrer with a bin-batch system permits doubling of the normal 0. 75 to 1. 2 -m (2. 5 to 4 -ft) grain depth without an excessive moisture content variation from bottom to top at the completion of drying (Brooker etal., 1974). Two prior studies dealt with disturbance effects of auger stirring. Toms(1968) pictorially defined the region disturbed by a stirring auger as it rotated without hori-zontal movement in a plexiglas-windowed box with a horizontal cross-section 100 mm by 1. 8 m (4 in. by 6 ft), containing corn to a depth of 1. 8 m (6 ft). After about 15 min of operation, the disturbed region assumed a constant volume having a top width of 790 to 960 mm (31 to 38 in.) and a bottom width of 150 mm (6 in.). This volume appeared thoroughly mixed. Hall and Beaty (1970) studied the mixing action of a stirring auger on wheat in a model bin at various horizontal travel rates and rotational speeds. For thorough blending of the 305 -mm (12 -in.) grain depth, traverse paths of the auger had to be adjacent, or spaced apart and repeated several times. Blending effectiveness improved as rotational speed increased and as horizontal travel rate decreased. This paper reports on a study undertaken to define the boundaries of the region disturbed by a moving stir-ring auger and to investigate effects of auger-stirring on corn bulk density and kernel orientation (Bern, 1973) ...|$|R
40|$|It {{will be very}} {{interesting}} for many important reactions to endow highly active catalysts with momentum-transfer efficiency.

The CCGC magnetically transferred momentum in a batch or continuous flow reactor. The external magnetic field can drive the catalyst to transfer momentum for excellent agitation. The catalyst can be fixed at an appointed position in the continuous flow for efficient separation. The separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture also becomes facile. The CCGC showed superior retention as a pollutant adsorbent for the removal of Rhodamine B (Rh-B) from water in the absence of magnetic or mechanical stirring apparatus.

Here, we present numerical simulations to support the observation of Boyland et al. that the region of high stretch is comparable with that through which the stirring elements move during operation of the device. We describe a fast technique for computing the velocity field for either inviscid, irrotational or highly viscous flow, which enables accurate numerical simulation of dye advection.

50|$|Superheating {{can occur}} when an {{undisturbed}} container {{of water is}} heated in a microwave oven. At the time the container is removed, the lack of nucleation sites prevents boiling, leaving the surface calm. However, once the water is disturbed, some of it violently flashes to steam, potentially spraying boiling {{water out of the}} container. The boiling can be triggered by jostling the cup, inserting a <b>stirring</b> <b>device,</b> or adding a substance like instant coffee or sugar. The chance of superheating is greater with smooth containers, because scratches or chips can house small pockets of air, which serve as nucleation points. Superheating is more likely after repeated heating and cooling cycles of an undisturbed container, as when a forgotten coffee cup is re-heated without being removed from a microwave oven. This is due to heating cycles releasing dissolved gases such as Oxygen and Nitrogen from the solvent. There are ways to prevent superheating in a microwave oven, such as putting a popsicle stick in the glass or using a scratched container.|$|R

In PEMSD, pseudo-emulsion is an emulsion that is formed temporarily between the organic and the stripping solutions. Both solutions are separated when the <b>stirring</b> <b>device</b> is stopped.
