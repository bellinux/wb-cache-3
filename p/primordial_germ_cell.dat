50|$|Bone {{morphogenetic}} protein 4 (BMP4) {{is released}} by the extra-embryonic ectoderm (ExE) at embryonic day 5.5 to 5.75 directly adjacent to the epiblast and causes {{the region of the}} epiblast nearest to the ExE to express Blimp1 and Prdm4 in a dose-dependent manner. This is evident as the number of PGCs forming in the epiblast decreases in proportion to the loss of BMP4 alleles. BMP4 acts through its downstream intercellular transcription factors SMAD1 and SMAD5. During approximately the same time, WNT3 starts to be expressed in the posterior visceral endoderm of the epiblast. WNT3 signalling {{has been shown to be}} essential in order for the epiblast to acquire responsiveness to the BMP4 signal from the ExE. WNT3 mutants fail to establish a <b>primordial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> population, but this can be restored with exogenous WNT activity. The WNT3/β-catenin signalling pathway is essential for the expression of the transcription factor T (Brachyury), a transcription factor that is was previously characterized somatic and mesoderm specific genes. T was recently found to be both necessary and sufficient to induce the expression of the known PGC specification genes Blimp1 and Prdm4. The induction of Transcription Factor T was seen 12 hours after BMP/WNT signaling, as opposed to the 24 to 36 hours it took for Blimp1 and Prdm4 genes to be expressed. Transcription factor T acts upstream of BLIMP1 and PRDM4 in PGC specification by binding to the genes respective enhancer elements. It is important to note that while T can activate the expression of Blimp1 and Prdm4 in the absence of both BMP4 and WNT3, pre-exposure of PGC progenitors to WNTs (without BMP4) prevents T from activating these genes. Details on how BMP4 prevents T from inducing mesodermal genes, and only activate PGC specification genes, remain unclear.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} we show that mouse {{primordial}} germ cells and fetal germ cells at certain stages of differentiation express E-cadherin and α and β catenins. Moreover, we demonstrate that the formation of germ cell aggregates that rapidly occurs when monodispersed germ cell populations are released from embryonic gonads in culture is E-cadherin mediated, developmentally regulated, and dependent on {{the sex of the}} germ cells. Immunoblotting analyses indicate that the lower ability to form aggregates of primordial germ cells in comparison to fetal germ cells is not due to gross changes in E-cadherin expression, altered association with β catenin, or changes in β catenin phosphorylation. Investigating possible functions of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion in <b>primordial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development, we found that E-cadherin-mediated adhesion may stimulate the motility of primordial germ cells. Moreover, treatment of primordial germ cells cultured on STO cell monolayers with an anti-E-cadherin antibody caused a significant decrease in their number and markedly reduced their ability to form colonies in vitro. The same in vitro treatment of explanted undifferentiated gonadal ridges cultured for 4 days results in decreased numbers and altered localization of the germ cell inside the gonads.

Using an in vitro short time assay which allows a quantitative measure of adhesion between cells, in the present paper we show that SCF/c-kit interaction can modulate <b>primordial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion to somatic cells. We report that the adhesiveness of 11. 5 dpc primordial germ cells to four types of somatic cells in culture (TM 4 cells, STO fibroblasts, bone marrow stromal cells and gonadal somatic cells) is significantly reduced by antibodies directed against c-kit receptor or SCF, as well by soluble SCF. This SCF/c-kit mediated adhesion seems independent of SCF-induced tyrosine autophosphorylation of c-kit receptor. Moreover, primordial germ cells showed a poor ability to adhere to a bone marrow stromal cell line carrying the Sl(d) mutation (unable to synthesize membrane-bound SCF). This adhesiveness was not further impaired by anti-c-kit antibody. These results demonstrate that SCF/c-kit interaction contributes to the adhesion of primordial germ cells to somatic cells in culture and suggest that {{the role played by}} SCF in promoting survival, proliferation and migration of these cells in vitro and in vivo, demonstrated by several studies, might depend on the ability of the membrane-bound form of this cytokine to directly mediate <b>primordial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion to the surrounding somatic cells...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. – Background: Explanations for {{asymmetric}} {{patterns of}} diversification continue to challenge paleontologists and neontologists with competing hypotheses within genetic-development and ecological frameworks. In 1988, a hypothesis was proposed that tied a <b>primordial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> (PGC) determination mechanism to clade (phyla) diversification. Two general mechanisms for PGC determination are recognized: one is termed induced because induction signals {{are required for}} the production of primordial germ cells. The other mechanism is cell-autonomous, i. e. determinative, because the cells that develop in response to specific cytoplasmic determinants in the oocyte are pre-destined to become PGCs. We revisited the hypothesis and analyzed phyla diversity with germ cell determination mechanisms and examined sister clade asymmetry. Results: After 25 years of additional data accumulation, the hypothesis that high levels of species diversification are associated with the induced mode is falsified, with the determinative mode revealed as associated with higher rates of diversification. The greater species numbers are significantly associated (ANOVA p> 0. 003) with the determinative mode. Analysis with appropriate sister clades is unanimous in showing the clade with the determinative mode has a significantly greater number of species relative to its induced sister clade. Conclusions: The <b>primordial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> determination mechanism hypothesis explains asymmetrical species diversity and morphological disparity at the phylum level. We argue that the determinative mode of <b>primordial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> determination is a constraint release that has enhanced evolvability and increased rates of speciation and morphological disparity among clades. Knowledge of the mechanism for extant theropods allows speculation that its sister clade, the Sauropodomorpha would have exhibited the induced mode.
