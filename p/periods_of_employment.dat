50|$|First, the Court {{seems to}} promote a very generous {{interpretation}} {{of the concept of}} worker under the article 45 TFEU. This is especially true considering Mr.Koupatantze’s situation, seeing that his total time of employment amounts to a mere month and a half, below the three or six month threshold usually formulated in specific regulations. This is said to blur the boundaries between worker and non-worker, and can lead to the question if previous <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> will hold out to be a relevant criterion at all towards the future.|$|E

50|$|Fonagy, Bateman, {{and colleagues}} have done {{extensive}} outcome research on MBT for borderline personality disorder. The first randomized, controlled trial {{was published in}} 1999, concerning MBT delivered in a partial hospital setting. The results showed real-world clinical effectiveness that compared favorably with existing treatments for BPD. A follow-up study published in 2003 demonstrated that MBT is cost-effective. Encouraging results were also found in an 18-month study, in which subjects {{were randomly assigned to}} an outpatient MBT treatment condition versus a structured clinical management (SCM) treatment. The lasting efficacy of MBT was demonstrated in an 8-year follow-up of patients from the original trial, comparing MBT versus treatment as usual. In that research, patients who had received MBT had less medication use, fewer hospitalizations and longer <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> compared to patients who received standard care. Replication studies have been published by other European investigators. Researchers have also demonstrated the effectiveness of MBT for adolescents {{as well as that of}} a group-only format of MBT.|$|E
50|$|Mattel sued MGA Entertainment for $500 million, {{alleging that}} Bratz creator Carter Bryant {{was working for}} Mattel when he {{developed}} the idea for Bratz. On July 17, 2008, a federal jury ruled that Bryant had created the Bratz while {{he was working for}} Mattel, despite MGA's claim that Bryant had not been employed by Mattel at the time and Bryant's assertion that he had designed the Bratz between two separate <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> at Mattel. The jury also ruled that MGA and its Chief Executive Officer Isaac Larian were liable for converting Mattel property for their own use and intentionally interfering with the contractual duties owed by Bryant to Mattel. On August 26, the jury decided that Mattel was to be paid just US $100 million in damages, citing that only the first generation of Bratz had infringed on Mattel property and that MGA had innovated and evolved the product significantly enough that subsequent generations of Bratz could not be conclusively found to be infringing.|$|E
25|$|Women's {{personal}} name changes were recorded less often, {{so they may}} not have changed their names as frequently as men did, but women who went into service as maids or entertainers frequently changed their names for the duration of their service. During their employment, their temporary names were treated as their legal names. For example, a maid who was involved in legal dealings in Kyoto in 1819-1831 signed legal documents as Sayo during one <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and as Mitsu during a later <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> but she signed as Iwa, presumably her birth name, when she was between jobs.|$|R

5000|$|In 2013, the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities adopted {{its second}} opinion on Latvia, stating [...] "Regarding access to pensions, the Advisory Committee regrets that the 2009 Andrejeva Judgment of the European Court on Human Rights has not {{led to a}} {{comprehensive}} solution regarding the calculation of pensions of citizens and [...] "non-citizens". It notes the Government's view that the judgment has been implemented by signing bilateral agreements with the Russian Federation {{and a number of}} other countries in which [...] "non-citizens" [...] spent <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> under the Soviet Union, but remains concerned by the fact that these agreements do not cover all former republics of the Soviet Union and are therefore not suitable to address the situation vis-à-vis all [...] "non-citizens". It notes with interest reports of a new case relating to the calculation of pension benefits having beenregistered at the European Court of Human Rights following the rejection of the Constitutional Court in February 2011 of the complaints of five [...] "non-citizens" [...] relating to relevant sections of the State Pension Act".|$|E
50|$|Another {{explanation}} {{relates to}} the structure of the Danish labor market, which consists primarily of highly skilled jobs with firm-specific training and few low skill or entry level positions. In addition, many entry level jobs require vocational training which most immigrants lack. Denmark's labor market is also characterized as flexible, with high levels of employee turn over. Immigrants' lack of language skills and cultural knowledge have been argued to be linked to their shorter <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and lengthier dependency on unemployment benefits. The length of time an immigrant has lived in Denmark, their Danish language skills, and their associations with native Danes have been identified as being positively linked to immigrant employment. The connection between the gender of immigrants and these as well as additional factors, such as parenthood, and the level of Danish language skills, and the importance of education and employment qualifications differ among male and female immigrants. One study found that men’s language skills and qualifications were of less importance than for women immigrants applying for jobs. It was also found that immigrant women with small children {{were less likely to be}} employed than those without.|$|E
5000|$|After the War, Deakin enjoyed two <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> {{as a staff}} {{photographer}} on the British {{edition of}} Vogue. The first period, from 1947 to 1948, ended in dismissal when he lost several valuable bits of photographic equipment. His second period was from 1951 to 1954, and during those three years Deakin was at his most active. He enjoyed the support of Vogue editor Audrey Withers, even though he disliked fashion photography. Deakin excelled at portraits of leading figures in literature, theatre and film. His subjects included Dylan Thomas, John Huston, Luchino Visconti and many other artistic celebrities. Deakin recognised this work was his true vocation when he wrote: [...] "Being fatally drawn to the human race, what I want to do when I take a photograph is make a revelation about it. So my sitters turn into my victims. But I {{would like to add}} that it is only those with a daemon, however small and of whatever kind, whose faces lend themselves to being victimised at all. And the only complaints I have ever had from my victims have been from the bad ones, the vainies, the meanies" ...|$|E
50|$|Profit-sharing {{plans are}} usually vested in ten years, {{although}} {{in some cases}} a plan may serve essentially as a pension by allowing {{a limited amount of}} vesting should the employee retire or leave on good terms after an extended <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{two long}} <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> Perez had during his life gave him {{enormous}} opportunities {{to write for}} the church, and religious music represents {{the largest and most}} elaborate part of his output. In his earliest career he is reported by Florimo to have 'enriched with his compositions' Palermo’s Cappella Palatina, but there are many pieces written for Naples as well. In Lisbon, the deep religiosity of his pupil, the Royal Princess Maria and his own, combined with the directions taken by the musical policy of the court, had himself concentrating in church music for the royal chapels for the last 23 years of his life. His first mass is dated February 1736, and most of his early works have very ample and careful use of orchestral and choral resources. For example, the mass dated 24 February 1740 is scored for two choirs (the final 'cum Sancto Spiritu' is a ten voice fugue), full strings divided, in some sections, in two orchestras, woodwinds (no clarinets), horns and trumpets in pairs. It displays a highly detailed orchestral writing: muted strings, seconda corda instructed in passages for the violins, plenty of orchestral crescendos and diminuendos, solo parts for the woodwinds and for the viola. In this period, Perez treated solo voices {{in a manner similar to}} operatic arias, most fugues or fugato sections have very symmetrical entries of themes, and the pieces in the so-called stile antico are conservative in harmony and notation.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, {{every person}} paid under the PAYE scheme is {{allocated}} a tax code by HM Revenue and Customs. This is {{usually in the}} form of a number followed by a letter suffix, though other 'non-standard' codes are also used. This code describes to employers how much tax to deduct from an employee. The code is normally based on information provided to HMRC by the taxpayer or their employer. Tax codes are usually adjusted once a year to take into account any changes made in the National Budget, but can be altered more often to reflect an employee's circumstances. Tax codes can be changed if someone has paid too much or too little tax the previous tax year, if an employee receives state benefits, or has non-PAYE income (for example, self-employed earnings). Changes in a tax code are to ensure the employee has paid the correct amount of tax by the end of each tax year.Tax codes are passed between <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> by a P45, which is generated when a person leaves a job. If a P45 is mislaid or not supplied at the end of a period of employment, a P46 can be filled out in order to determine which tax code is applicable to a person. Between submitting a P46 and receiving the correct tax code from HM Revenue and Customs, an employer can apply the emergency tax code on a week 1 basis. In this case, tax will be calculated as if the employee is working in the first week of the tax year, and all previous earnings are ignored.At the end of each tax year employers are required to send out a P60 which documents the total earnings and tax a person has paid within that tax year.|$|E
5000|$|The {{employment}} of children, young persons and women is regulated as regards ordinary and exceptional hours of work, ordinary and exceptional meal-times, length of spells and holidays. The outside limits of ordinary <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and holidays are, broadly, {{the same for}} textile factories as for non-textile factories and workshops; the main difference lies in the requirement of not less than a total two hours' interval for meals out of the twelve, and a limit of {{four and a half}} hours for any spell of work, a longer weekly half holiday, and a prohibition of overtime, in textile factories, as compared with a total one and a half hours' interval for meals and a limit of five hours for spells and (conditional) permission of overtime in non-textile factories. The hours of work must be specified, and from Monday to Friday may be between 6 A.M. and 6 P.M., or 7 A.M. to 7 P.M.; in non-textile factories and workshops the hours also may be taken between 8 A.M. and 8 P.M. or by order of the secretary of state for special industries 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. Between these outside limits, with the proviso that mealtimes must be fixed and limits as to spells observed, women and young persons may be employed the full-time, children on the contrary only half time, on alternate days, or in alternate sets attending school half time regularly. On Saturdays, in textile factories in which the period commences at 6 A.M. all manufacturing work must cease at 12 if not less than one hour is given for meals, or I I.30 if less than one hour is given for meals (half an hour extra allowed for cleaning), and in non-textile factories and workshops at 2 P.M., 3 P.M. or 4 P.M., according as the hour of beginning is 6 A.M., 7 A.M. or 8 A.M. In [...] " [...] domestic workshops [...] " [...] the total number of hours for young persons and children must not exceed those allowed in ordinary workshops, but the outside limits for beginning and ending are wider; and the case is similar as regards hours of women in [...] " [...] women's workshops." [...] Employment outside a factory or workshop in the business of the same is limited {{in a manner similar to}} that laid down in the Shop Hours Act, to be touched on presently. Overtime in certain classes of factories, workshops and warehouses attached to them is permitted, under conditions specified in the acts, for women, to meet seasonal or unforeseen pressure of business, or where goods of a perishable nature are dealt with, for young persons only in a very limited degree in factories liable to stoppage for drought or flood, or for an unfinished process. These and other cases of exceptional working are under minute and careful administrative regulations. Broadly these same regulations as to exceptional overtime may apply in laundries but the act of 1907 granted to laundries not merely [...] to the manufacture carried on in a factory or workshop (e.g. shirt and collar factories), additional power to fix different <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> for different days of the week, and to make use of one or other of two exceptional methods of arranging the daily periods so as to permit of periods of different length on different days; these exceptional periods cannot be worked in addition to overtime permissible under the general law. Laundries carried on in connexion with charitable or reformatory institutions were brought in 1907 within the scope of the law, but special schemes for regulation as to hours, meals, holidays, &c., may be submitted by the managers to the secretary of state, who is empowered to approve them if he is satisfied that they are not less favourable than the corresponding provisions of the principal act; such schemes shall be laid as soon as possible before both Houses of Parliament.|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} among 100 assistant nurses working in six different residential home.

In order to fulfill my purpose, I have chosen to use three questions: Have the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> in the workplace any impact on how the assistant nurses experience the psychosocial work environment? In the future it will become a lack of staff in elderly care. How do those working in elderly care today feel about the future? How important are the manager and colleagues for how assistant nurses are experiencing the psychosocial work environment? In order to answer the questions a quantitative method and a questionnaire has been used. The results were analyzed using SPSS and presented in the form of frequency tables, cross tabulations, chi square test and the sperman rho test. The results showed that the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> did not had an impact on the staffs´ experience of the psychosocial work environment.
