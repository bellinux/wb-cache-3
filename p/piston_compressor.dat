50|$|A proven {{method to}} {{compress}} Hydrogen {{is to apply}} reciprocating <b>piston</b> <b>compressors.</b> Widely used in refineries, they are the backbone of refining crude oil. Reciprocating <b>piston</b> <b>compressors</b> are commonly available as either oil-lubricated or non-lubricated; for high pressure (350 - 700 bar), non-lubricated compressors are preferred to avoid oil contamination of the Hydrogen. Expert know-how on piston sealing and packing rings can ensure that reciprocating compressors outperform the competing technologies in terms of MTBO (Mean Time Between Overhaul).|$|R
50|$|The gas {{compression}} {{process of}} a rotary screw is a continuous sweeping motion, {{so there is}} very little pulsation or surging of flow, as occurs with <b>piston</b> <b>compressors.</b>|$|R
50|$|A rotary-screw {{compressor}} {{is a type}} of {{gas compressor}} that uses a rotary-type positive-displacement mechanism. They are commonly used to replace <b>piston</b> <b>compressors</b> where large volumes of high-pressure air are needed, either for large industrial applications or to operate high-power air tools such as jackhammers.|$|R
50|$|In the {{ionic liquid}} <b>piston</b> <b>compressor</b> many seals and {{bearings}} were removed {{in the design}} as the ionic liquid does not mix with the gas. Service life is about 10 times longer than a regular diaphragm compressor with reduced maintenance during use, energy costs are reduced {{by as much as}} 20%. The heat exchangers that are used in a normal <b>piston</b> <b>compressor</b> are removed as the heat is removed in the cylinder itself where it is generated. Almost 100% of the energy going into the process is being used with little energy wasted as reject heat.|$|E

50|$|GEA Refrigeration Technologies GmbH, with {{headquarters}} in Bochum, Germany, is a developer, manufacturer, and supplier of industrial refrigeration and freezer technology. Its product portfolio includes <b>piston</b> <b>compressors,</b> screw compressors, chillers, tunnel freezers, carton and spiral freezers, industrial ice generators, valves and valve sets, driers, and exhaust ventilators.|$|R
50|$|Small petrol {{two-stroke}} engines, such as for motorcycles, use crankcase compression {{rather than}} a separate supercharger or scavenge blower. This uses {{both sides of the}} piston as working faces, the lower side of the piston acting as a <b>piston</b> <b>compressor</b> to compress the inlet charge ready for the next stroke. The piston is still considered as single-acting, as only one of these faces produces power.|$|E
50|$|Two {{commonly}} used forced-induction compressors are turbochargers and superchargers. A turbocharger is a centrifugal compressor {{driven by the}} flow of exhaust gasses. Superchargers use various different types of compressors but are all powered directly by {{the rotation of the}} engine, usually through a belt drive. The compressor can be centrifugal or a Roots-type for positive displacement compression. An example of an internal compressor is a screw-type supercharger or a <b>piston</b> <b>compressor.</b>|$|E

50|$|Hydraulic {{compressors}} {{are usually}} divided in four main groups: <b>piston</b> <b>compressors,</b> rotary vane compressors, rotary screw compressors and gear compressors. The piston-models {{are the most}} suitable for basic need for compressed air such as energizing small handtools or airflushing of small quarry drills. Rotary vane-models include also a cooled lubrication system, oil separator, relief valve on the air intake and automatic rotation speed valve. Rotary vane-models are the most suitable for installation on different excavators, mining and other machines.|$|R
50|$|Most {{compressors}} {{are either}} positive displacement compressors or radial compressors. Positive displacement compressors are currently {{the most efficient}} type of compressor, and have the largest refrigerating effect per single unit (400-2500 RT). They have a large range of possible power supplies, and can be 380 V, 1000 V, or even higher. The principle behind positive displacement compressors utilizes a turbine to compress refrigerant into high-pressure vapor. Positive displacement compressors are of four main types: screw compressor, rolling <b>piston</b> <b>compressor,</b> reciprocating compressor, and rotary compressor.|$|E
50|$|The Brayton {{cycle is}} a {{thermodynamic}} cycle named after George Bailey Brayton {{that describes the}} workings of a constant-pressure heat engine. The original Brayton engines used a <b>piston</b> <b>compressor</b> and piston expander, but more modern gas turbine engines and airbreathing jet engines also follow the Brayton cycle. Although the cycle is usually run as an open system (and indeed must be run as such if internal combustion is used), it is conventionally assumed {{for the purposes of}} thermodynamic analysis that the exhaust gases are reused in the intake, enabling analysis as a closed system.|$|E

40|$|Thermodynamic {{modelling}} is {{a crucial}} factor in the simulation of the dynamic operation of the reciprocating <b>piston</b> <b>compressors.</b> Their study requires the analytical knowledge of {{the properties of the}} refrigerant from the energy and thermodynamics points of view {{as well as that of}} the mechanics of fluids.

25|$|Rotary vane {{compressors}} {{consist of}} a rotor {{with a number of}} blades inserted in radial slots in the rotor. The rotor is mounted offset in a larger housing that is either circular or a more complex shape. As the rotor turns, blades slide {{in and out of the}} slots keeping contact with the outer wall of the housing. Thus, a series of increasing and decreasing volumes is created by the rotating blades. Rotary Vane <b>compressors</b> are, with <b>piston</b> <b>compressors</b> one of the oldest of compressor technologies.|$|R

50|$|Modern Brayton {{engines are}} almost always a turbine type, {{although}} Brayton only made piston engines. In the original 19th-century Brayton engine, ambient air is drawn into a <b>piston</b> <b>compressor,</b> where it is compressed; ideally an isentropic process. The compressed air then runs through a mixing chamber where fuel is added, an isobaric process. The pressurized air and fuel mixture is then ignited in an expansion cylinder and energy is released, causing the heated air and combustion products to expand through a piston/cylinder, another ideally isentropic process. Some of the work extracted by the piston/cylinder is used to drive the compressor through a crankshaft arrangement.|$|E

50|$|Reciprocating {{compress}}ors, {{also called}} recips or <b>piston</b> <b>compressors,</b> from NEA compress air and technical gases. Oil-free and lubricated reciprocating compressors range up to 100,000 Nm³/h suction volume, 30,000 kW driving power and 1,000 bar final pressure are produced {{at the headquarters}} in Übach-Palenberg and in Wurzen near Leipzig. The larger compressors are manufactured in Übach-Palenberg and smaller sizes are built in Wurzen. The core competence {{in the production of}} compressors has also been expanded through the acquisition of Stasskol, a manufacturer of piston rings and sealing systems.|$|R

40|$|In non-lubricated <b>piston</b> <b>compressors</b> {{the wear}} of the piston rod packing rings {{is still a}} problem {{that needs to be}} considered. Due to the demands of high gas {{pressure}} and leak-tight sealing the frictional heat of the rings is causing high temperatures {{in the area of the}} piston rod packing. High temperatures are – among other factors – one reason for an increase of wear and thus for a lifetime reduction of the packing. To increase this lifetime – and so to increase the time between two technical services – the idea of an internal cooling of the piston rod with a phase changing medium was created. To investigate this new cooling method for non-lubricated <b>piston</b> <b>compressors</b> a research project between the EFRC R 2 ̆ 6 D Working Group (European Forum for Reciprocating Compressors) and the Technical University of Dresden was initiated. Within this project a test bench with a full scale balanced opposed process gas compressor was set up and measurements shall be taken. The measured values will be used for a validation of a thermal simulation model based on the software ANSYS. Also a model test rig is investigated which allows the investigation of temperature along a hollow piston rod in a moving system...|$|R
