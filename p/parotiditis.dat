40|$|The {{enlargement}} of the parotid gland develops in inflammatory or stenotic conditions but after Cesarean section the symptomatology is unusual. A 38 year old patient with no obstetrical history referred to our clinic for pregnancy, which followed our national program of prenatal care. The outcome of the pregnancy was favorable for both mother and fetus. During labor the fetus developed bradycardia and the patient delivered by Cesarean section a 3400 g baby-boy with 8 Apgar Score; the anesthesia was spinal. 18 hours after delivery the patient presented mild respiratory distress. The symptomatology {{was caused by the}} {{enlargement of}} the parotid gland. The treatment was supportive and the remission occurred 10 hours after the onset. The initial discussion that raised this case was caused by the viral, infection and stenotic cause of the <b>parotiditis.</b> All these reasons had no medical argument. It was also debated about the anesthesia but, until now, the medical literature didn’t report any case of association between <b>parotiditis</b> and spinal anesthesia. It is also impossible to correlate the <b>parotiditis</b> with IVF procedure. As a conclusion, this case is unique because it represents the <b>parotiditis</b> without unknown case that appeared after Cesarean section and spinal anesthesia in a healthy woman...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years {{evidence}} has emerged to indicate the involvement of herpes viruses in several infectious complications observed in patients undergoing antiblastic chemotherapy. We present a case of bilateral <b>parotiditis</b> due to EBV reactivation in a patient who had received chemotherapy because of an invasive thymoma. In October 2006, a 53 -year-old man with pulmonary and pleural metastases owing to an invasive thymoma, was started on chemotherapy with cisplatin, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide. In January 2007, after consultation with an infectious disease specialist, the patient was admitted to the oncology department because of bilateral swelling of the parotid glands which was most likely of infectious or mycotic origin and attributed to immunosuppression by chemotherapy (the last cycle was completed on 28 th December 2006). During his hospital stay, the patient underwent routine blood tests, serological tests (EBV-VCA IgM/IgG: positive/positive, EBV-EBNA IgG: positive), cultural and instrumental tests. Due to the serological results, we decided to search for EBV in blood by using PCR (23, 000 copies/ 100, 000 cells). We hypothesize that EBV infection could have caused both thymoma and bilateral <b>parotiditis.</b> Accordingly, a multidisciplinary approach, including consultation with an oncologist, infectious disease and microbiology specialists, {{is the best way to}} manage infectious complications in patients with a deficit of cells-mediated immunity...|$|E
40|$|Aim : {{to study}} safety and {{immunological}} efficacy of vaccination against influenza in separate and associated immunization {{according to the}} National Calendar. Patients and methods : 100 children with various disorders as well as children with HIV subjected to revaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, measles, <b>parotiditis</b> and rubella, were included into the study. Children were divided into 5 groups of 20 persons each: groups of separate or associated vaccination. In order to assess safety of vaccination children were observed for 30 days after vaccination. In order to analyze immunologic efficacy participants were taken serum tests before and on the 30 th day after vaccination. Results : the study demonstrated high safety of the vaccine against influenza. Mild and moderate topical and general reactions were observed in isolated instances and {{did not differ in}} comparison groups. Simultaneous vaccination against influenza with immunization against diphtheria, <b>parotiditis</b> and rubella did not influence synthesis of antibodies, while synthesis of antibodies against measles was decreased; immunization against diphtheria and measles when associated with vaccination against influenza depressed synthesis of antibodies against A/H 3 N 2 influenza. Conclusions : vaccine against influenza has low reactivity, high safety and can be used in association with immunization according to the National calendar in independence to somatic disorders of patients.  </p...|$|E

40|$|A 68 -year-old Caucasian female was {{admitted}} to the emergency department with a progressive history of behavioural symptoms and anxiety followed by visual and auditory hallucinations, forgetfulness, and impaired gait in the previous 3 months. On examination she was psychotic and had a postural and rest tremor of the upper limbs, cogwheel rigidity of the four limbs, retropulsion on standing position, and inability to walk. During the following 2 weeks she developed xerostomia and unilateral <b>parotiditis</b> that improved with steroids. A simultaneous improvement of the cognitive abilities allowed for the detection of sensory ataxia of the lower limbs. Sensory ganglionopathy was then detected with electrophysiological studies.

40|$|Parotid gland {{tuberculosis}} is {{an extremely}} rare form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, even in countries where tuberculosis is endemic like India; however, it should be included {{as one of the}} differentials of discrete parotid swelling as it generally presents as a slow-growing mass indistinguishable from a malignancy and even imaging too, can’t differentiate these clearly. The majority of the previously reported cases were mostly unilateral and diagnosed by histopathological examination of post parotidectomy specimens. Here we are describing a case of tuberculosis of both parotid glands in a 25  year-old male who was referred to us with bilateral parotid region swelling of two month duration. Tubercular <b>parotiditis</b> was confirmed by demonstration of epithelioid granuloma and caseous necrosis compatible with TB on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).

40|$|I {{read with}} {{interest}} the article by Edwards and Wasserman 1 on the evaluation of cystic salivary gland lesions by fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). In their 21 cases, a correct diagnosis was rendered in 15, including a case of abscess. Two false negative cases in which carcinomas were misinterpreted as benign neoplasms were encountered. The authors {{emphasized the importance of}} recognizing the diagnostic pitfall in which a cystic carcinoma was underdiagnosed because of inadequate sampling or cellular dilution by cyst fluid. We report a case of parotid carcinoma with spontaneous necrosis and cavitation that was misdiagnosed as an abscess on FNAB. A 43 -year-old man presented with a 2 -month history of right parotid swelling and tenderness. The initial clinical impression was <b>parotiditis,</b> but there was no improvement with antibiotic treatment. FNAB obtained a small amount of thick fluid, which was smeared and cultured. The FNAB smears were interpreted as an abscess (Figure 1 A), but the bacterial cultures yielded no growth.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONBladder {{cancer is}} a {{significant}} epidemiological disease. It is managed by primary resection and on-going surveillance for recurrent disease. Intravesical BCG therapy is used in superficial carcinomas to lower the incidence of recurrence and prolong the time to recurrence. BCG therapy {{is not without its}} rare but serious side effects. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 75 -year-old man presented to the urologist with right testicular pain, after four previous TURBT operations, two courses of intravesical BCG therapy and one STAT dose of intravesical mitomycin. The patient's USS testis showed hypoechoic lesions in the right testis. An orchiectomy was carried out due to the possibility of the USS showing a malignancy. Histology confirmed BCG epididymo-orchitis. DISCUSSIONThis patient presented with testicular pain fifteen months after the cessation of BCG therapy. Clinicians {{need to be aware of}} the potentially long dormancy periods for BCG infections, and their complications, as well as the acute infective BCG presentations. The literature is reviewed and shows the wide range of infective BCG presentations from acute disseminated sepsis to insidious focal infections such as <b>parotiditis</b> and discitis. CONCLUSIONThis case report demonstrates that due to the delayed and gradual onset of symptoms, BCG infections are difficult to diagnose.

40|$|Retropharyngeal {{infections in}} horses {{normally}} induce local painful {{swelling of the}} retropharyngeal area, which may lead to dyspnea, dysphagia, and systemic manifestations. Differential diagnosis of local painful swelling of the retropharyngeal area includes retropharyngeal lymph node infection, neoplasm, cellulitis, hematoma, guttural pouch empyema, <b>parotiditis,</b> and jugular thrombosis. Apart from Streptococcus equi ssp. equi, other bacteria are rarely reported {{as a cause of}} retropharyngeal abscesses. The reason for this might be a lack of specific sampling to identify the causative agent. This work deals with a case of retropharyngeal infection in an 11 -year-old Standardbred stallion with acute depression, fever, tachycardia, asymmetric painful swelling in the throat area, ptyalism, and respiratory distress. Endoscopy, radiography, ultrasonography, blood analysis, and cytological examination of a puncture sample taken from the throat mass were consistent with a pyogenic to pyogranulomatous retropharyngeal inflammation. The clinical evolution was initially satisfactory in response to treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and antibiotics, but clinical signs relapsed twice, each time a few weeks after cessation of antibiotic therapy. The bacteriologic finding in this case was unusual and consisted of the isolation of a Pasteurella multocida strain that was obtained after the second relapse (ie, 79 days after initial admission), using a brain heart infusion (BHI) medium, and after two successive negative bacteriological cultures performed on day one of clinical signs and at the first relapse of clinical signs, respectively.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the results of treatment of parotid surgical diseases using only periauricular incision. 36 consecutive patients with parotid tumors were reviewed. Pleomorphic adenoma (17 cases) was the most common pathologic type followed by other benign tumors (9 cases), carcinoma (5 cases), parotid cyst (3 cases) and chronic <b>parotiditis</b> (2 cases). All parotidectomies were performed through a periauricular incision. In presence of carcinoma, upper cervical lymphadenectomy was conducted through a transverse cervical incision. The wounds were closed with subcutaneous synthesis without skin suture. The parotid tumors were removed in all cases without complementary skin approach. The incisions had good esthetic result and almost imperceptible scars were verified after six months. The patients were very satisfied with the appearance of the operative scar. All patients complained hypostesia of the operative area during a period not longer than six months. Temporary postoperative facial weakness occurred after 28 operations and was permanent in three of patients operated upon for carcinoma. Transitory ear discomfort occurred in 22 patients. Two cases of local infection were recorded. All of these complications have been described previously by other authors using other incisions and are mostly due to removal of the gland.

40|$|Objective:Mumps {{infection}} is endemic in Iran and mumps <b>parotiditis</b> is acommon disease in Iranian children. There {{has been a}} dramaticdecrease in the worldwide incidence of mumps since the introductionand use in 1968 of the very effective and inexpensive mumps vaccine. In Iran probably due to {{a higher percentage of}} unvaccinated youngpersons < 15 yr, the incidence rate of mumps infection and its sequelaare higher in comparison to corresponding data from developedcountries prior to comprehensive vaccination programs. The aim ofthe study was to investigate the effects of the mumps virus on cochlearfunction and to determine the frequency of related Sensory NeuralHearing Loss (SNHL) in children. Material& Methods:This descriptive case-series study was conducted in 94 children, agedless than 14 years, hospitalized between 1999 and 2001, in thepediatric ward of the Hazrat Rasool Hospital in Tehran. All patientswith documented mumps infection (specific mumps-IgM antibody) were evaluated twice for audiometeric function on the basis ofdiagnostic parameters for sensory neural hearing loss; the first evaluationwas done on admission and the second three weeks later. 54 patients(age range 1 - 14 y, mean age 4. 83 ± 3. 93, male: female ratio 30 : 24) were studied in two years. Results:The highest incidence of mumps was seen in winter (37 %) and spring(28 %) and the lowest in summer (13 %). Specific IgM antibody formumps virus was detected in 74 children. Comprehensive audiologicevaluation was done in 54 patients at admission and again 3 weekslater. SNHL was detected in 7. 2 % of patients; the 4. 4 % incidence ofSNHL in this study was higher than in other studies in developedcountries prior to comprehensive vaccination programs.

Besides agglomerates with typical small oval or round intracellular bodies, pre-flagellate and flagellate organisms, others are found in which the great amount of parasites and marked pressure exerted by them against each other render very difficult their identification; sometimes the similitude of such agglamerates to Toxoplasma is striking (Fig. 1 and 1 A). In such a case, {{the structure of the}} blepharoplast (Fig. 1 and IA), usually preserved, is profitable and allows the identification of the pre-flagellate and flagellate forms of Schizotrypanum cruzi. Most of the small sensitive nerves in the epicardium shows mononuclear infiltration of the perineurium (perineuritis, Figs. 12 - 14). Microscopically there is extensive Zenker's degeneration (Figs. 6 - 8) and parasitism of the heart muscle fibers, marked cellular infiltration of the interstitial connective tissue, which are found in the ordinary musculature of every chamber of the heart (Figs. 10 - 11) as well as in Tawara's node (Fig. 9), main bundle (Fig. 2) and right (Fig. 4) and left (Fig. 5) septal divisions of the bundle of His, and perineuritis.
