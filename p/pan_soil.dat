MBT'/MBT' 5 ME (methylation index of branched tetraethers) and CBT/CBT' (cyclization ratio of branched tetraethers) are ratios {{based on the}} relative abundances of brGDGTs. Using these ratios, global and regional/local calibrations have been established using surface soils, but generally without any preliminary study of soil types. In this study, we reconsider global MAAT-pH/brGDGT calibrations by assigning soil types to the 358 components of a composite soil dataset. Additionally, we investigate brGDGT-derived proxies in five well-described soil profiles along an altitudinal transect in the Mount Fan Si Pan National Park, northwestern Vietnam. Our results show that at the global scale, traditional MAAT-pH/brGDGT relationships per soil type are significantly different and that MAAT (and pH) residuals per soil type may differ as well, for example between Alisols and Podzols. This effect persists when 5 - and 6 -methyl brGDGTs are quantified separately. Moreover, MAAT (and pH) residuals per soil type are generally not clearly reduced, including in Leptosols, in which 6 -methyl brGDGTs are present. In the Fan Si Pan transect, MBT'/CBT-MAAT estimates showed no significant deviation from expected MAATs. We find, however, that soil type effect - related to vegetation changes and contrasting soil organic carbon properties - may bias MAAT-pH estimates in the Vietnamese soil transect. Furthermore, soil depth plays a role which differs between the different Fan Si <b>Pan</b> <b>soil</b> profiles, likely determined by soil type and history...|$|E

We tested (1) whether the occurrence of larger-bodied herbivore species increases with PAM, but is independent of PAN, (2) whether the occurrence of smaller-bodied herbivore species decreases with PAM, but increases with PAN, and (3) whether herbivore species richness is highest in areas with intermediate PAM and high PAN. We analyzed the distribution and richness of the 16 large (> 10 kg) herbivore species found in sub-Himalayan mainland India. Since the distributions of large herbivores in India have been altered by historic human activity, we only used India's largest 76 protected areas as data points, with respect to PAM (log 10 (rainfall/potential evapotranspiration)), <b>PAN</b> (<b>soil</b> cation exchange capacity), elevation, tree cover, and fire frequency. Using regression and null models to analyze the data, we found positive relations between PAM and the occurrences of the larger-bodied species (elephant and gaur), and negative relations between PAM and the occurrences of smaller-bodied species (chinkara, four-horned antelope and blackbuck). We also found positive relations between the occurrence of the smaller-bodied species and PAN. Large herbivore species richness in India is highest in Kanha and Indravati, areas with high PAN and intermediate PAM. We found that elevation, tree cover and fire frequency were insignificant predictors of herbivore species richness, although elevation and tree cover explained the distribution of a few species. Based on our null model analyses results, we conclude that moisture and soil nutrients are important in determining large herbivore species distribution and richness in sub-Himalayan India...|$|E

Soil physical properties and maize root abundance were determined in three different soils of the Rolling Pampa of Argentina, in conventionally-tilled (CT) and zero-tilled (ZT) fields cultivated with maize. In the soil with a light Bt horizon (loamy Typic Argiudoll, Chivilcoy site), induced plough pans were detected in CT plots {{at a depth of}} 0 - 0. 12 m through significant increases in bulk density (1. 15 to 1. 27 Mg m- 3) and cone (tip angle of 60 º) penetrometer resistance (7. 18 to 9. 37 MPa in summer from ZT to CT, respectively). This caused a reduction in maize root abundance of 40 - 80 % in CT compared to ZT plots below the induced pans. Two of the studied soils had hard-structured Bt horizons (clay pans), but in only one of them (silty clay loam Abruptic Argiudoll, Villa Lía site) the expected penetrometer resistance increases (up to 9 MPa) were observed with depth.

The literature study in Chapter 2 illustrates that industrial atmospheric fluoride emissions can have negative environmental impacts, including accumulation in surface soil horizons, necrosis in leaves, and fluorosis in plants and animals. Fluorides from this site are from two sources – stacks and evaporation pans. Samples to measure fluoride concentration in air, soil and vegetation and deposition rate were taken and analysed from February to August 2007. Standard analytical methods {{were used for the}} analysis of fluorides in all samples. Evaluation of historical environmental monitoring at Pelindaba showed that stack emissions were high in the year 2002 followed by a dramatic decrease in 2003 and 2004. In 2005, there was a sharp increase in emissions, with further slight increases until August 2007. For all media and sample types taken (air concentration, deposition, soil and vegetation), samples from nearby the evaporation pans had the highest fluoride concentrations. Results from sampling sites close to the stacks were lower, but still well above off-campus background sites, and above values from Pelindaba sites distant from the stacks. Fluoride concentrations in animal bones from previous studies done at the site showed enhanced fluoride concentrations compared to control samples. The project hypothesis was that fluoride emissions from Necsa Pelindaba site do not {{have a negative impact on}} the environment. This hypothesis is proven correct to the extent that no off-site adverse impacts or concentrations were observed. Limited on-campus impacts were observed localised around the evaporation pans and to a lesser extent around the stacks. Airborne fluoride concentration values around the pans only were above the South African guideline values. Deposition values were highest around the pans. The only visible leaf damage attributable to fluoride was on a Karee tree ~ 50 m from the edge of the <b>pan.</b> <b>Soil</b> fluoride concentrations from the current study were within the range of natural fluoride concentrations in soil. Despite evidence of local deposition, there was no evidence of fluoride accumulation in surface or subsurface soils. No impacts were observed elsewhere around the site or off-site. Based on the results of this work, fluoride emissions from the stacks do not pose a threat to the environment, provided that efficiency of the gas scrubbing equipment is maintained at current levels. Emissions from the pans pose a minor localised problem that nevertheless requires investigation and mitigation...|$|E

The current seven billion people on earth are expected to reach nine billion by 2050 with resulting demands on world food production. In addition, the quality of our environment is being impacted by human activities, including agricultural production and crop fertilization. Nitrogen (N) management is the process of applying N fertilizers in a way to maximize use of N by crops, while minimizing loss to the environment. It is becoming imperative, as a means of increasing crop yields and food supplies, while reducing input usage, and minimizing the impact of N fertilization on the quality of our environment, that improved N application practices be identified and utilized. The objectives for this study were to compare the timing of anhydrous ammonia (AA) fertilizer N applications, fall and spring, with and without two different nitrification inhibitors (NI) as possible tools to enhance yield and Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) in corn (Zea mays) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Kansas. Two different nitrification inhibitors were tested as alternatives, N-Serve (nitrapyrin) produced and marketed by Dow AgroSciences, and an experimental product under development by Koch Agronomic Services LLC. Three differing rates of the experimental product were used to assist in determining the optimal rate for this product. The study was conducted over two growing seasons, 2012 and 2013, which differed significantly in rainfall, rainfall distribution, and resulting NUE. Experiments were established at three sites for both crops in both years, on sites/soils selected for differing potentials for N loss, and mechanisms of N loss. One site was established at the Kansas State University Agronomy North Farm (N Farm), where yield potential was high, and N loss potential was low. A second site was established under irrigation at the Kansas River Valley Experiment Field near Topeka, KS (KRV), on a coarse silt loam soil with high potential for N loss through leaching. The third site was established at the East Central Kansas Experiment Field near Ottawa KS (ECK), on a clay <b>pan</b> <b>soil</b> with a high potential for denitrification loss. Weather conditions {{together with}} soil characteristics {{played a major role in}} the performance of N timing applications and impacted the response to the use of the inhibitors. In low N loss environments such as the N Farm, fall applications of AA to increase spring time-availability for producers showed minimal negative effects on yield or NUE. When combined with a nitrification inhibitor in the fall, performance was similar to spring application for both corn and wheat. At the KRV site leaching loss or potential loss from fall application was high for corn and wheat in both years, however little impact on NUE with NI use was observed. At the high ECK denitrification site, there was only one N loss potential event leading to inhibitor performance at Ottawa in corn in 2013...|$|E

Transport and placement of overburden can also be accomplished using scraper pans. Operating scraper pans is more cost effective than the truck shovel method; thus, there is a desire to institute scraper pans as the primary method of reclamation.

40|$|Understanding runoff {{processes}} in a basin is {{of paramount importance}} for the effective planning and management of water resources, in particular in data-scarce regions such as the Upper Blue Nile. Hydrological models representing the underlying hydrological processes can predict river discharges from ungauged catchments and allow for an understanding of the rainfall-runoff {{processes in}} those catchments. In this paper, such a conceptual process-based hydrological model is developed and applied to the upper Gumara and Gilgel Abay catchments (both located within the Upper Blue Nile Basin, the Lake Tana sub-basin) to study the runoff mechanisms and rainfall-runoff processes in the basin. Topography is considered as a proxy for the variability of most of the catchment characteristics. We divided the catchments into different runoff production areas using topographic criteria. Impermeable surfaces (rock outcrops and hard <b>soil</b> <b>pans,</b> common in the Upper Blue Nile Basin) were considered separately in the conceptual model. Based on model results, it can be inferred that about 65 % of the runoff appears in the form of interflow in the Gumara study catchment, and baseflow constitutes the larger proportion of runoff (44 - 48 %) in the Gilgel Abay catchment. Direct runoff represents a smaller fraction of the runoff in both catchments (18 - 19 % for the Gumara, and 20 % for the Gilgel Abay) and most of this direct runoff is generated through infiltration excess runoff mechanism from the impermeable rocks or hard <b>soil</b> <b>pans.</b> The study reveals that the hillslopes are recharge areas (sources of interflow and deep percolation) and direct runoff as saturated excess flow prevails from the flat slope areas. Overall, the model study suggests that identifying the catchments into different runoff production areas based on topography and including the impermeable rocky areas separately in the modeling process mimics the rainfall-runoff process in the Upper Blue Nile Basin well and yields a useful result for operational management of water resources in this data-scarce region...|$|R

A rainfall simulation experiment was conducted on <b>soil</b> <b>pans</b> {{to examine the effects of}} liquid swine manure application on runoff and soil loss under different hydrologic conditions. The results showed a significant change in soil loss due to manure application after 7 and 28 days moisture equilibration. A possible explanation for the change in erosion is that the changes in chemical state of the moist soil and their interaction with ions in the manure, especially Na and K, affected soil aggregation and consequently, soil dispersion and loss.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the land {{degradation}} minimizing effects of Conservation Agriculture (CA) as promoted among smallholder Zambian farmers. It {{found no evidence of}} CA associated improvements in soil fertility after five years of CA practice, most probably because crop residues were removed from the fields. The study reports high phosphorus (15. 53 mg kg - 1) and potassium (0. 75 cmol kg - 1) levels, low nitrogen (0. 12 %) and organic carbon (1. 19 %) levels, and no plough/hoe <b>pans</b> in <b>soils</b> from both CA and conventionally (CV) managed fields. This is in part contrary to the dominant land degradation narratives which have been the basis for promoting CA in the study areas. Faidherbia albida, a leguminous tree promoted as part of the CA package in Zambia, is associated with significantly higher levels of nitrogen, organic carbon and potassium under its canopy. Its planting by CA farmers is linked to the incentives provided by CA promoters. Average maize yields of 3. 8 t ha - 1 and 2. 8 t ha - 1 were reported under CA and CV systems respectively. Government subsidies for mineral fertilizer and hybrid seed promote maize mono-cropping and remain unsupportive of CA. It is concluded that the dominant land degradation narrative, which posits population induced land degradation, may not hold in this case. Instead, the removal of crop residues and low levels of mineral fertilizer and manure amendments may better explain the soil fertility status of the study areas. More nutrient replacement strategies are required if the benefits of CA on soil fertility are to be actualized in the immediate future. </p...|$|R
40|$|Although both {{aboveground}} and belowground {{components of}} vegetation act together in reducing soil erosion, mainly the aboveground component has received attention in past research. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the contribution of roots in soil erosion control and the effect of root density in soil erodibility and soil physical properties. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L. Hugo) was grown in <b>soil</b> <b>pans,</b> and laboratory rainfall simulation experiments were conducted after 4, 8, 12 weeks of their growth with seeding density of 50 kg ha- 1, after 4 weeks for seeding density of 100 kg ha- 1, and on a control. The experiments with ryegrass were done in the presence of complete plants and after clipping off the shoots. Roots of ryegrass grew rapidly, attaining densities of 0. 614 kg m- 2 and 2. 280 kg m- 2 in 4 and 12 weeks, respectively. With increasing root density, splash and wash decreased exponentially. There was positive correlation between soil shear strength and root density, but no influence of roots on bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity was observed...|$|R
