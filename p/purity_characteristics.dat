Hence, validity of the mutiplicativity/additivity conjecture for a class of CP maps implies its validity for complementary maps. The class of CP maps complementary to entanglement-breaking ones is described and is shown to contain diagonal CP maps as a proper subclass, resulting in new class of CP maps (channels) for which the multiplicativity/additivity holds.

The study of the tribological node included monitoring the friction factor depending on time, and monitoring {{the temperature of the}} sliding node depending on time. In the triboelement shaft – bearing, we monitored the weight losses as well as changes in the selected characteristic of contact surface roughness. The monitored characteristic was Ra.

40|$|Background/PurposeCellular {{therapy has}} been applied to animal studies and {{clinical}} trials for acute or subacute myocardial infarction. Little is known about the effect of cell therapy on chronic myocardial infarction. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate myocardial performance after human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (hMSCs) transplantation in rats with chronic myocardial infarction. MethodsThe hMSCs were obtained from adult human bone marrow and expanded in vitro. The <b>purity</b> and <b>characteristics</b> of hMSCs were identified by flow cytometry and immunophenotyping. Splenectomy in male rats was performed to prevent immune reaction. One week after splenectomy, ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery was performed to induce myocardial infarction. Four weeks after ligation of the coronary artery, culture-expanded hMSCs were injected intramyocardially at the left anterior free wall. Left ventricular function measured by echocardiography, infarct size and immunohistochemical stain were performed to evaluate the effect of the therapy. ResultsThe engrafted hMSCs were positive for the cardiac marker troponin T. Infarct size (35. 4 ± 3. 4 % vs. 53. 3 ± 3. 0 %, p < 0. 001) and fibrotic area (2. 6 ± 0. 1 % vs. 5. 9 ± 0. 2 %, p < 0. 001) were significantly smaller in the hMSC-treated group than in the control group at 28 days after therapy. hMSC transplantation resulted in smaller left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (6. 5 ± 0. 1 mm vs. 7. 9 ± 0. 7 mm, p < 0. 001) and better left ventricular ejection fraction (88. 7 ± 1. 2 % vs. 65. 8 ± 2. 5 %, p < 0. 001) than in the control group. Capillary density was markedly increased after hMSC transplantation compared with the control group. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that intramyocardial transplantation of hMSCs improves cardiac function after chronic myocardial infarction through enhancement of angiogenesis and myogenesis in the ischemic myocardium. Transplantation of hMSCs for myocardial regeneration may become the future therapy for chronic myocardial infarction...|$|R

Geometry of the proposed antenna array was optimized for the operation in two frequency bands located inside IEEE L band. Presented array structure is composed from ten microstrip radiators independently excited via separate coaxial input ports. Two central radiating elements for two frequency bands have circular shapes with slits and are stacked to provide compact sizes and convergence of their phase centers. Peripheral radiators have annular ring with slits topology. Their geometric centers are superposed with the corners of virtual quadrats with the sides equal to the half of the wavelength for the appropriate band to eliminate the appearance of grating lobes and additional nulls in equivalent radiation patterns. The main feature of the array is its compact packaging that causes significant levels of electromagnetic mutual coupling.

Analysis of recombinant glycine sarcosine N-methyltransferase (rGSMT) and recombinant sarcosine dimethylglycine N-methyltransferase (rSDMT) from Escherichia coli indicated that betaine synthesis is rate-limited by rGSMT and is constitutively activated by rSDMT. Therefore, it is of interest to purify native GSMT from Methanohalophilus portucalensis to further compare its enzymatic characteristics and kinetics with rGSMT. In this study, native GSMT was purified through DEAE ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography with 95 % <b>purity.</b> The enzymatic <b>characteristics</b> of GSMT and rGSMT showed similar trends of activities that were activated by high concentrations of monovalent cations. Both were feedback-inhibited by the end product, betaine, and competitively inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). Native GSMT was 2 -fold more sensitive to SAH than rGSMT. Notably, comparison of the kinetic parameters illustrated that the turnover rate of glycine methylation of GSMT was promoted by potassium ions, whereas rGSMT was activated by increasing protein-glycine binding affinity. These results suggest that GSMT and rGSMT may have different levels of post-translational modifications. Our preliminary mass spectrometry evidence {{indicated that there was}} no detectable phosphosite on GSMT after the complicated purification processes, whereas purified rGSMT still possessed 23. 1 % of its initial phosphorylation level.

Competition radioimmunoassay with an anti-rat virus serum which recognized rodent group-specific antigens on gp 55 indicated: the presence of gp 55 antigens in 15 rodent cell lines, but not 10 nonrodent cell lines; no effect of viral infection or cell transformation on the amount of gp 55 expressed; up to 100 -fold increases in the concentration of the gp 55 antigens in nine rodent retroviruses, but not in five nonrodent viruses, as compared to cells; the presence of gp 55 in rodent sera, especially of the NZB mouse, where anti-gp 55 antibody was also detected; a lymphoid and epithelial tissue distribution of gp 55 in rats and mice. Additional competition radioimmunoassays with a broad-reacting antivirus serum also detected the presence of gp 55 in nonrodent, mink, and human cells and thus distinguished rat type, rodent group, and interspecies antigenic determinants on gp 55. In conclusion, gp 55 is a cell membrane glycoprotein associated in high concentration with retroviruses...|$|R
40|$|Telecommunication {{systems of}} {{spacecraft}} on deep space missions also function as instruments for Radio Science experiments. Radio scientists utilize the telecommunication links between spacecraft and Earth to examine very {{small changes in}} the phase/frequency, amplitude, and/or polarization of radio signals to investigate a host of physical phenomena in the solar system. Several missions augmented the radio communication system with an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) {{in order to provide}} a highly stable reference signal for oneway downlink. This configuration is used in order to enable better investigations of the atmospheres of the planets occulting the line-of-sight to the spacecraft; one-way communication was required and the transponders' built-in auxiliary oscillators were neither sufficiently stable nor spectrally pure for the occultation experiments. Since Radio Science instrumentation is distributed between the spacecraft and the ground stations, the Deep Space Network (DSN) is also equipped to function as a world-class instrument for Radio Science research. For a detailed account of Radio Science experiments, methodology, key discoveries, and the DSN's historical contribution to the field, see Asmar and Renzetti (1993). The tools of Radio Science can be and have also been utilized in addressing several mission engineering challenges; e. g., characterization of spacecraft nutation and anomalous motion, antenna calibrations, and communications during surface landing phases. Since the first quartz USO was flown on Voyager, the technology has advanced significantly, affording future missions higher sensitivity in reconstructing the temperature pressure profiles of the atmospheres under study as well as other physical phenomena of interest to Radio Science. This paper surveys the trends in stability and spectral <b>purity</b> performance, design <b>characteristics</b> including size and mass, as well as cost and history of these clocks in space...|$|R
