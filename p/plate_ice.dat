This method consists in computing an asymptotic behaviour for large time obtained {{by means of the}} Laplace transform by using the analytic continuation of the resolvent of the problem. This leads to represent the solution as the sum of a discrete superposition of exponentially damped oscillating motions associated to the poles of the analytic continuation called resonances of the system, and a low frequency component associated to a branch point at frequency zero.

Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in Wistar albino rats using a hot <b>plate,</b> <b>ice</b> plate and Randall-Selitto assay for analgesic; rota-rod and open field test for CNS depressant activities. The different potencies (3 X, 6 X, 12 X and 30 C) of Solanum nigrum were administered orally (0. 5 ml/rat/day) for 30 days and response was assessed after 30 minutes of drug administration on 10 th, 20 th and 30 th day. Results: The result shows that all the four potencies of Solanum nigrum has increased the latency time required to raise and lick the paws for thermal sensation on hot plate test and for cold sensation on ice plate test and also increased the degree of threshold pressure to mechanically induced pain on Randall-Selitto assay but depressed the motor coordination and locomotor activities.

Therefore, {{it is important to}} produce snow at temperatures above 0 °C to be able to maintain the snow activity close to the cities. Today, temperature independent snow machines(TIS) produce <b>plate</b> <b>ice,</b> flake ice and ice slurry in temperatures above 0 °C. There are four manufacturers of TIS, IDE Technologies, TechnoAlpin(TA), SnowTech and SnowMagic Inc. The machines are using refrigerants with challenging properties, and CO 2 is investigated as a substitute for these. Vacuum and flake ice systems with a production capacity of 50 tons/day are modelled in EES, to investigate the thermodynamic performance at different ambient temperatures. The flake ice model shows that a single stage system(SCS) consumes less energy than a two-stage system(TCS) in ambient temperatures below 14 °C. The U-value and ice growth rate for the flake ice drum(FID) are highly dependent on the ice thickness. Ice has high thermal resistance, and dictates the heat transfer from water to CO 2 rather than the metals or the refrigerants. The vacuum model shows that a two stage system(TVS) is more efficient than a single stage system(SVS) regardless of the ambient temperature. A cascade system with CO 2 is more energy intensive than the two previous systems. The most efficient vacuum system consumes just 20, 8 % of the energy required by the least efficient flake ice system. In terms of operation costs, the snow from the flake ice system is 4, 8 times more expensive than from the vacuum systems. However, the investment costs are much higher for the vacuum system. Both the SCS and TCS is more energy efficient than the TA SF 100. The energy consumption is 3, 4 % and 1, 8 % lower, respectively. A comparison between the vacuum models and existing machines is difficult, due to little known information about the existing machine. COMSOL was used to do calculations on the FID. The results reveal that increasing the number of refrigerant pipes in the FID above 200, do not affect the temperature distribution on the freezing surface too much. In addition, the thickness can be optimized regarding the structural strength, rather than the heat transfer. It is suggested to work further with improving the EES- and COMSOL models, investigate heat recovery possibilities, improving the efficiency of the systems, estimating the life cycle cost, look into operation strategies to minimize the energy consumption, and to build prototypes...|$|E

40|$|Sublimators {{have been}} used for heat {{rejection}} for a variety of space applications including the Apollo Lunar Module and the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). Some of the attractive features of sublimators are that they are compact, lightweight, and self-regulating. One of the drawbacks of previous designs has been sensitivity to non-volatile contamination in the feedwater, which can clog relatively small pores (approx. 3 - 6 micrometers) in the porous <b>plates</b> where <b>ice</b> forms and sublimates. A new design that is less sensitive to contaminants is being developed at the Johnson Space Center (JSC). This paper describes the design, fabrication, and testing of the Contaminant Insensitive Sublimator (CIS) Engineering Development Unit (EDU) ...|$|R
