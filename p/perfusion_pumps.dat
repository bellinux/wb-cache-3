40|$|During {{coronary}} angioplasty, perfusion {{distal to}} the inflated angioplasty balloon {{can be maintained}} with autoperfusion balloon catheters and coronary <b>perfusion</b> <b>pumps.</b> The blood flow rates through the autoperfusion balloon catheters and the flow rates achieved with a perfusion pump were compared in vitro with fresh human blood at 37 degrees C. In a specially designed system, blood flow rates through StackTM autoperfusion balloon catheters were measured at 40, 60 and 80 mmHg continuous pressure. In another system, driving pressures were measured during perfusion with the pump, through a specially designed forced perfusion catheter at 20, 40 and 60 ml/min flow. The pressure applied in the autoperfusion experiments was converted into atmospheres (atm) to facilitate comparison with the driving pressures measured during pumping (1 mmHg = 1. 316 x 10 (- 3) atm). Mean flow rates through the autoperfusion balloon catheters were: 46 ml/min at 0. 05 atm, 66 ml/min at 0. 09 atm and 75 ml/min at 0. 1 atm. Mean pressures during pumping were: 1. 8 atm at 20 ml/min, 3. 5 atm at 40 ml/min, 5 afm at 60 ml/min. Due to the phasic nature of coronary blood flow, the flow through autoperfusion balloons is generally lower than the minimum required for adequate myocardial protection (= 60 ml/min). Thus, autoperfusion balloon catheters are simpler and cheaper devices than <b>perfusion</b> <b>pumps,</b> but generally they {{are not able to}} provide adequate myocardial protection...|$|E
40|$|Distal {{coronary}} hemoperfusion during percutaneous transluminal {{coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA) -with an autoperfusion balloon or active system-facilitates prolonged balloon inflation. Prolonged inflations may tack up intimal dissections {{and improve the}} primary angioplasty result in complex lesions. Additionally, distal perfusion may reduce the likelihood of cardiogenic shock during high-risk PTCA. Autoperfusion balloons are most frequently used to treat acute or threatened closure. There currently is no prospective clinical study showing that stent implantation for this complication is more successful and more cost-effective. The blood flow rates through autoperfusion balloons may not abolish myocardial ischemia, and higher flow rates can often be achieved with pumps. Therefore, during high-risk PTCA, pumps may be preferred to prevent hemodynamic collapse. Clinical application of <b>perfusion</b> <b>pumps</b> is hampered by the risk for mechanical hemolysis during prolonged perfusion and the high velocity of the bloodstream that exits the PTCA catheter, causing distal vessel wall trauma.

40|$|Background: In the Netherlands {{approximately}} 100, 000 {{patients are}} diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 1. For {{most of these}} patients the treatment with insulin injections is sufficient in lowering the glucose level in the blood. For some patients however {{it is difficult to}} dose the proper quantity of insulin, sometimes resulting in hypoglycaemia. To prevent hypoglycaemic states in patients research is done on transplantation of the islets of Langerhans. Oxygen shortage during preservation causes damage to the islets which is why more than one donor pancreas is needed for a successful transplantation. A promising preservation method for better islets viability and functionality is hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) of the pancreas. The existing machine <b>perfusion</b> <b>pumps</b> are not suitable for the pancreas. A new machine perfusion pump for the pancreas should be designed and the optimal perfusion pressure of this machine should be determined. Methods and materials: Eleven porcine pancreases were perfused for a period of two hours. The pancreases were perfused with pressures of 10, 20, 40 and 70 mm Hg. Before and after perfusion, biopsies were taken for analysis {{of the quality of the}} perfusion and for the ATP content. Samples of the perfusion fluid were taken for amylase, lipase and LDH measurements. Results: A pumping system for HMP of the pancreas was developed. With this system, the pancreas could be perfused with an oxygenised perfusion fluid on a desired pressure. The temperature could be lowered to 6 ˚C. A pressure of 10 mm Hg caused incomplete perfusion of the pancreas. Perfusion with a pressure of 20 mm Hg perfused the complete pancreas; most of the cells were vital. Pressures of 40 and 70 mm Hg caused oedema in the pancreas tissue. Most of the cells were dead, as is visible on the viability staining. Conclusion: The design of the pump is suitable for HMP of the pancreas. A limitation of the system is that it is not portable and contains only one pump for perfusion of two arteries. 	The ideal perfusion pressure for HMP of the pancreas is 20 mm Hg. A perfusion pressure of 10 mm Hg is too low for HMP of the pancreas. Perfusion pressure of 40 mm Hg or 70 mm Hg is too high and caused damage to the pancreatic tissue. ...|$|E

This system uses a conventional intra-aortic balloon pump to activate the <b>perfusion</b> <b>pump.</b> Our study used basic and animal experiments to investigate the most suitable system for coronary perfusion using this new concept. MethodsA conventional intra-aortic balloon pump was used to supply power. A device for perfusion was developed with a balloon placed inside a stiff syringe barrel. The device {{was connected to the}} helium gas line of the intra-aortic balloon pump. Changes in flow with changes in augmentation level were noted when volumes outside and within the balloon were changed. Six pigs with occlusion of the left anterior descending artery were used for system validation, with monitoring to identify changes in hemodynamics and cardiac enzyme levels. ResultsIn the basic experiment, an 80 -mL outside volume and 3. 0 -mL inner volume resulted in the greatest percentage change in flow rate with respect to changes in augmentation. In the animal experiment, the new coronary active perfusion system prevented myocardial ischemia during coronary occlusion. ConclusionsWe clarified the most suitable method for our new coronary active perfusion system. Using this system, safe anastomosis was consistently performed in animal experiments.

A Gregg cannula was passed through the left common carotid artery until the tip fitted snugly in the left circumflex coronary artery. The cannula was perfused with blood from the left femoral artery and blood flow through the cannula was maintained constant with a <b>perfusion</b> <b>pump.</b> <b>Perfusion</b> pressure in the coronary artery was measured from a side arm in the cannula, and resistance in that vessel was calculated as the ratio of pressure to blood flow. Capsaicin (10 - 20 micrograms/kg), injected into the right jugular vein, produced significant (P less than 0. 05) decreases in heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, coronary arterial pressure and coronary arterial resistance. These responses were abolished by bilateral vagotomy. Neither left atrial injections of capsaicin nor acutely decreasing the systemic arterial pressure by occluding the inferior vena cava had a significant effect on the coronary arterial pressure or resistance. Additionally, overdrive pacing of the heart had no effect on the reflex decreases in coronary arterial pressure and resistance that were evoked when capsaicin was injected into the jugular vein. alpha-Adrenergic blockade reduced the reflex decrease in coronary arterial pressure and resistance evoked by capsaicin by 31 and 38 %, respectively. Combined alpha-adrenergic and cholinergic blockade reduced the reflex decreases in both coronary arterial pressure and resistance by approximately 89 %. These results indicate that activation of pulmonary C fibres produces a reflex decrease in coronary arterial resistance, and that this response is due to the combined effects of increased parasympathetic cholinergic activity and withdrawal of alpha-adrenergic tone...|$|R

Systemic hemodynamic parameters and temperature remained constant during the experiments. Despite changes in femoral mean arterial pressure (160 to 54 mm Hg) and AVDO 2 (1. 8 to 8. 2 ml O/ 2 /dl) that occurred with femoral blood flow reduction, peripheral A-V shunting remained constant at 4. 1 - 5. 5 %.

When hindlimb blood flow was normal or increased, autoregulation of O 2 extraction maintained constant hindlimb O 2 consumption, despite sympathectomy-induced changes in A-V shunting. Subnormal femoral artery blood flow reduced hindlimb O 2 consumption, and in this setting the increased A-V shunting further decreased femoral AVDO 2 and O 2 consumption.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{inflammation}} {{that accompanies}} {{the pain and}} swelling associated with osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis is mediated by complex interactions of inflammatory mediators. Cytokines play {{a pivotal role in}} orchestrating many of these processes, including inflammatory cell recruitment, adhesion and activation. In addition, prostaglandins are secreted into the synovial cavity and are involved in perpetuation of local inflammation, vasodilatation and vasoconstriction, and also with bone resorption. Pre-clinical models have been developed in order to correlate to the human disease and principle among these is the adjuvant-induced arthritis model in the rat. Methods We have developed a technique to quantitatively assess the contents of synovial fluid samples from rat joints. Two needles joined together are inserted into the knee joint of anaesthetised rats and connected to a Watson-Marlow <b>perfusion</b> <b>pump.</b> Sterile saline is infused and withdrawn at 100 μl min - 1 until a 250 μl sample is collected. Results Our results demonstrate up to 125 fold increases in synovial IL 1 α and IL 1 β concentrations, approximately 30 fold increases in levels of IL 6 and IL 10 and a 200 – 300 fold elevation in synovial concentrations of TNFα during FCA-induced experimental arthritis. Finally, this novel technique has demonstrated a dose-response relationship between FCA and the total cell counts of synovial perfusates. Conclusion In summary, this new technique provides a robust method for quantifying inflammatory mediators and cells from the synovial cavity itself, thereby detailing the inflammatory processes from within the capsule and excluding those processes occurring in other tissues surrounding the entire articulation. </p...|$|R
40|$|In the past, the {{treatment}} of benign uterine lesions required, in many instances, a hysterectomy. These days, most cases can be successfully treated by hysteroscopy.

The electroresection technique is preferred to that using the Nd-YAG laser because of its lower cost and its equivalent efficacy. By using the uterine <b>perfusion</b> <b>pump</b> device, the risk of resorption syndrome can be reduced to its minimum. Submucosal myomas < 1 cm, benign endometrial hyperplasia and adenomyosis are the commonest benign lesions treated. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding can also be treated by an endometrectomy. A preoperative workup includes a transvaginal ultrasound and a biopsy. This ensures that only benign lesions that are accessible to a hysteroscopy will be submitted to this technique and that no cases of endometrial cancer or atypical hyperplasia would be ignored.

Strategies have been devised to manipulate and modify these processes, improving tissue and organ survival and function. These have involved the use of preservation solutions. Although most research involves organ transplantation, these principles have been translated and applied to various tissues, surgical flaps and microvascular replantations. These studies have generally used the skin flap as their model with little knowledge regarding muscle flaps, the most vulnerable to the ischaemic process. This study targets the use of one such preservation system and uses skeletal muscle as its tissue model. The vascular anatomy of the rectus femoris muscle in the New Zealand white rabbit was studied anatomically and radiologically and thus described. The isolated rectus femoris muscle flap was harvested and perfused in-vitro with cooled, oxygenated University of Wisconsin solution (UWS) using a pulsatile renal <b>perfusion</b> <b>pump.</b> UWS was selected as it contains vital additives important in cryopreservation of organs. Monitoring of various physiological parameters was performed. The muscle was examined at 0, 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 hours of extra-corporeal perfusion using warm and cold, non-perfused controls. The contralateral muscle served as the control. End-points were the percentage of muscle survival, as determined by a new grading system of muscle ischaemia, based on 3 light and 7 electron microscopic criteria. The overall percentage of muscle survival (combined light and electron microscopy scores) resulted in approximately 58...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Purpose: {{to assess}} the loss in {{hematocrit}} and hemoglobin, if any, 24 hours after hip arthroscopy. Methods: thirty-five patients were included. Laboratory tests including complete blood count and white blood cells were performed one week prior to surgery and 24 hours after. Surgical time, volume of saline <b>perfusion</b> and <b>pump</b> <b>perfusion</b> was also recorded. Results: mean preoperative hematocrit was 42. 01 % (4. 63 SD), whereas mean postoperative hematocrit at 24 h decreased to 36. 78 % (SD 5. 11) (p < 0. 021.). Mean preoperative hemoglobin was 14. 23 g/dL (1. 73 SD), and mean postoperative hemoglobin at 24 h decreased to 12. 40 g/dL (SD 1. 92) (p = 0. 03.). Platelets and white blood cells, {{as well as the}} remaining biochemical parameters showed no significant difference between preoperative and postoperative samples. Lost blood volume worked out with the logarithmic method for estimated blood loss was which 0. 78 liters (SD 0. 45). Lost blood volume taking into account, the red blood cell mass was also 0. 78 liters (SD 0. 45). Conclusion: a significant decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit after hip arthroscopy was observed. Although patients did not show clinical signs of anemia or bleeding, blood loss should be considered when planning a hip arthroscopy, especially in patients at risk of anemia. According to our results, we recommend a postoperative control analysis at 24 h...|$|R
40|$|Acardiac anomaly {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of multiple pregnancies. It is a hemodyamically disadvantaged nonviable twin which occurs in association with a twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence (TRAP). In TRAP, blood flows from an umbilical artery of the pump twin in reverse direction into umbilical artery of the perfused (or acardiac) twin via an arterial to arterial (AA) anastomosis. Its blood is poorly oxygenated and results in variable degrees of deficient development of the head, heart, and upper limb structures. The {{lower half of the}} body is usually better developed, which may be explained by the mechanism of <b>perfusion.</b> The <b>pump</b> twin is at risk of heart failure and problems related to preterm birth with a reported mortality of 50 - 75...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Static {{cold storage}} is {{generally}} used to preserve kidney allografts from deceased donors. Hypothermic machine perfusion may improve outcomes after transplantation {{but there have}} been few studies with limited power that have addressed this issue. OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence for the effectiveness of storing kidneys from deceased donors after cardiac death prior to transplantation, using cold static storage solutions or pulsatile hypothermic machine perfusion. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases were searched in September 2011 for systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials and other study designs that compared delayed graft function and graft survival. Sources included Cochrane Library, PUBMed and EMBASE. Studies excluded from review included those that were unable to discriminate between donation after cardiac death (DCD) and a neurologically deceased donor (NDD). REVIEW METHODS: Our primary outcomes were delayed graft function (DGF) and one year graft survival. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Review Manager software from the Cochrane database. RESULTS: A total of nine studies qualified for review. We found that pulsatile <b>perfusion</b> <b>pumped</b> kidneys from DCD donors had reduced DGF rates compared to kidneys that were placed in cold storage (p = 0. 03; odds ratio 0. 64, CI 0. 43 - 0. 95). Although, there was a trend towards improved 1 year graft survival in the pulsatile perfusion group, statistical significance was not reached (p = 0. 17; odds ratio 0. 74, CI 0. 48 - 1. 13). CONCLUSION: Pulsatile machine perfusion of DCD kidneys appears to reduce delayed graft function rates. There {{did not appear to be}} a benefit in regards to one year graft survival. Due to the great heterogeneity among the trials along with several confounding factors the overall impact upon allograft function and survival requires more study...|$|R
40|$|Although a {{role for}} the airway {{circulation}} in the clearance of inhaled particles is generally assumed, there is little information to confirm its importance. We studied the effects of decreased bronchial blood flow on the uptake of the soluble tracer technetium= 99 m–labeled diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (99 m Tc-DTPA) from subcarinal airways in sheep (n = 7). The bronchial artery was cannulated and perfused with autologous blood at a control flow (0. 6 mL/min/kg) or when the <b>perfusion</b> <b>pump</b> was stopped (no flow). 99 m Tc-DTPA (6 – 10 µL) was delivered by a microspray nozzle inserted through a bronchoscope to a fourth-generation bronchus both during control blood flow conditions and no-flow conditions. Airway retention (by scintigraphy) and blood uptake were monitored for 30 min after the local deposition of 99 m Tc-DTPA. During control flow conditions, 30 min after the delivery of the radiolabel, 21 % of the tracer remained at the deposition site. Of the total delivered tracer, maximum blood uptake was 18 % (n = 3). When bronchial perfusion was stopped, airway retention 30 min after deposition increased to 43 %, and maximum blood uptake decreased to 7 % of the total delivered tracer. Although mucociliary clearance was not directly measured, radiolabel tracer was observed to move progressively from the deposition site up to larger airways {{and contributed to the}} overall removal of tracer from the site of deposition during both flow conditions. However, these results demonstrate that decreased bronchial perfusion increases airway retention by limiting vascular uptake of the soluble tracer. These results emphasize the importance of normal perfusion of the airway vasculature for uptake of therapeutic agents delivered specifically to the conducting airways.
