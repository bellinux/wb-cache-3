The net personalty will amount to quite 100,000 pounds, and there is large realty, of which at present I do not know the value. All this is left to Mary with the fullest possible <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal.</b> You and I are appointed executors with a complimentary legacy of 500 pounds to you, and but 100 pounds to me. However, the testator 'in consideration of the forthcoming marriage between his son Morris and my daughter Mary, remits all debts and obligations that may be due to his estate by the said Richard Monk, Lieutenant-Colonel, Companion of the Bath, and an executor of this will.' This amounts to something, of course, but I will not trouble you with details at the moment.|$|E

40|$|As {{the right}} to sell may exist either {{as a result of}} ownership, or by virtue <b>of</b> a <b>power</b> without or {{independent}} of ownership, it is sometimes a question whether words indicating a right to sell, contained in an instrument granting an estate, are intended to give a power, or are merely descriptive of the rights incident to the estate given. When property is devised without any designation of the estate given, and the devise is followed by words indicating that the devisee is to have the right <b>of</b> absolute <b>disposal</b> in fee, or to sell in fee, it has often been held that the words indicating an absolute <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> show that the devisee was intended by the testator to have an estate in fee, not a life estate with a testamentary <b>power</b> <b>of</b> appointing the reversion. (See note 18 L. R. A. N. S. 463.) If the devise were expressly of an estate for life, no such inference could be indulged; and {{it would have to be}} held that the right <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> given was merely a testamentary power to appoint the reversion...|$|R

The theory can be applied to such diverse phenomena as the transfer of family businesses to the next generation, university chair succession, the passing on of parental roles (for example in the case of adoption or remarriage), and organ transplantation.

40|$|Whilst {{the laws}} {{affecting}} property {{in these countries}} have wisely given to every one an unrestricted <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> over the property of his own creation, they have, at the same time, indirectly interfered with that privilege in practice, by throwing obstacles {{in the way of}} the alienation of land, injurious alike to the owner or debtor, and his creditor. As the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> transferableness forms one of the elements of the value of a commodity, any restriction on that power is a diminution of its value to the owner; whilst his creditor, from the period that he became entitled to claim the property, by advancing his money, his labour, or his goods, is injured in proportion to the delay and expense attendant upon its alienation. In considering, therefore, economically, the laws that affect the transfer of land, I propose to review them not only as they affect the possessor or the debtor, but also his creditor; and will endeavour to establish that whilst mortgages and charges created by the owner should be the only permanent incumbrances upon land, yet that it will not be incompatible with the speedy transfer and improvement of real property, that it should be liable to the claims of judgment creditors...|$|R

40|$|Since {{human beings}} are not disembodied minds who {{instantly}} and costlessly absorb new knowledge, every scientific movement, {{if it is to}} flourish and advance, requires an institutional framework. By the institutional framework of a science, I mean a complementary set of means aimed at developing its ideas and theories, disseminating them among its active researchers and teachers, and inculcating them into its students and sympathetic public intellectuals. The institutions that constitute this framework include research institutes and libraries, graduate schools, regular conferences and colloquia, book series, and scholarly journals. Of course, the construction of such an institutional framework requires the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> over real resources, that is property, and the will to employ such property exclusively and without deviation for the advancement of the science. 1 The travesties of National Socialist “biology, ” Soviet Socialist “physics ” and the Keynesian “New Economics” should teach us that the property base that composes a science’s institutional framework must be entirely private and independent of the State. There is an exception to this key sociological principle of scientific progress. A creative genius such as Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, or Murray Rothbard working in isolation and outside a well-developed institutional framework may significantl...|$|R

40|$|Following the {{dismantling}} of a price-support program, a central bureaucracy is left with a commodity stockpile to dispose. It happened with wheat and feed grains in the U. S. in 1986 and wool in Australia in 1991. It soon may happen in Europe with grains, manufactured dairy products and other commodities which have supported prices. Obvious policies include privatising the stockpile, disposing of the stockpile by a central bureaucracy and quarantining the stockpile from the market. Each policy imposes constraints on disposal based, perhaps, on judgments of political acceptability to producers and government. In this article, optimal rules for production and disposal are derived and solved and a new policy is proposed. Then the model {{is applied to the}} <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> Australia's wool stockpile. Results show that centralised disposal will almost always be preferred to privatisation of the stockpile. Centralised disposal is also preferred to quarantining the stockpile if interest rates are high, but quarantining is preferred if interest rates are low. Centralised disposal and quarantining are not optimal, however. Optimal production and disposal combines the efficiency of privatisation with the market <b>power</b> <b>of</b> centralised <b>disposal.</b> To achieve this, the property rights to the stockpile can be redefined using payment-in-kind certificates and individual transferable entitlements. The payment-in-kind certificates assign ownership of the stockpile to individual producers who then make both production and disposal decisions. The individual transferable entitlements allow the industry to produce efficiently and extend market power from the central bureaucracy to producers. For the Australian wool stockpile, optimal production and disposal would benefit the industry by an estimated $ 2. 7 billion. Demand and Price Analysis, Productivity Analysis,...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of this {{research}} is to explore to what extent it is possible and useful to collect debts by sale of intellectual property rights (ip-rights) under execution in the Netherlands governed by the laws of the Netherlands. Due to their specific characteristics ip-rights “behave” differently than other property rights or goods, consequently some ip-rights are a less obvious/less suitable object for debt collection. The possibilities of and considerations for the use of ip-rights for debt collection are examined, first addressing the issues “security interests” and “seizure” under the laws of the Netherlands in general, subsequently addressing these issues with respect to the respective ip rights. Under the laws of the Netherlands all written ip rights may be pledged and seizure is possible for almost all written ip rights (only the moral rights are excluded). However, pledging or seizing ip-rights under the laws of the Netherlands is not a straightforward, uniform exercise. In {{this research}} the IP Supplement to the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Secured Transactions (2011) (UNCITRAL-regime) are used as reference point: relevant topics for this research in the UNCITRAL-regime are compared with the laws of the Netherlands. The research concludes with recommendations that aim to promote the use of ip-rights for debt collection. Summarized, I recommend implementation of the UNCITRAL regime, leading to uniform legislation: - on the creation of a security right in ip rights and the seizure of ip rights; - on the effectiveness of security rights in and seizures of ip rights against third parties, including the establishment of a (security) registry for (all) ip rights; - on the obligations of an ip owner after the security right in an ip right was created or after the ip right was seized; - on the method of the foreclosure sale of ip rights and the possibility to sell all ip rights in a manner other than in public. Furthermore, I recommend: - to introduce a (general) provision that stipulates that all ip rights are transferable; - to remove/limit the exceptions regarding moral rights; - to stipulate explicitly that ip rights, in spite of their immaterial nature, may be sequestrated and/or may be brought by the creditor beyond the debtor’s <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> within the scope of a foreclosure sale, in which respect the custodian will obtain all information regarding the ip right and is entitled to take all necessary measures required to preserve that ip right or the value thereof. And in conclusion the consequences of the specific characteristics of ip rights may be limited if the legal practice - will actually use ip rights for debt collection; - will learn to assess the status of ip rights more accurately by using more or less standardized due diligence questionnaires as a consequence whereof uncertainties associated with the nature of ip rights will decrease; - will assess the (lasting) value of ip rights more accurately by using ip due diligence and valuation experts using a specific valuation approach tailored to ip rights...|$|R

URN: [URL] En este artículo presento un esbozo de una teoría de transiciones entre antecesores y sucesores en contextos sociales institucionales e interpersonales. Algunos de ellos incluyen desde el cambio del jefe, director o dueño de una empresa familiar, la transición en una oficina universitaria, transiciones en relaciones matrimoniales y familiares, hasta el intercambio de órganos por medio de transplantes. El concepto central de la teoría es el de "transferencia de objetos personales", que denota el cambio en la disposición de ciertos objetos que tienen un sentido relevante para la identificación y la identidad del poseedor. En este artículo, especifico algunas dimensiones teóricas del concepto. Hablando en términos metodológicos se trata de un enfoque que puede llamarse una "teoría fundamentada formal": Por medio de la comparación de diferentes casos y dominios empíricos, de manera hermenéutica, se origina una categoría de ciencia social comprensiva que puede usarse para la conceptualización de la dinámica de estructuras interpersonales, sociales, institucionales.
