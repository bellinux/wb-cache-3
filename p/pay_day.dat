2500|$|Heenan is [...] {{considered}} by many to be the greatest wrestling manager of all time, including WWE, who placed him at the top of their 25 greatest managers list in 2011. Author Brian Shields notes that many consider him [...] "one of the most significant figures in professional wrestling history". For his work in promoting André the Giant's match with Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania III, often cited as the most famous American professional wrestling match, Heenan received a six-figure payoff—arguably the largest <b>pay</b> <b>day</b> in any managerial career. Broadcaster Peter Rosenberg considers Heenan a personal hero and describes him as the best commentator, manager and bad guy in WWE history. Rosenberg stated that Heenan [...] "operated on multiple levels", adding: [...] "If you were a little kid, he was the foil to your hero. As an adult, you look back and appreciate just how much of a comedic genius he was." ...|$|E

[...] WWE announcer Jim Ross said before Shamrock's scheduled fight with Bobby Lashley in early 2009; [...] "There was a time that I could see the veteran, 45-year-old Shamrock, a former WWE superstar, schooling the MMA rookie Lashley but that ship has long since sailed. I have great respect for Ken but he's outstayed his welcome in the octagon, cage, whatever and needs to teach and coach and stop fighting...Kenny is fighting for one more <b>pay</b> <b>day</b> while Lashley is fighting to help establish what he hopes will be a long term, lucrative, MMA career." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of 1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson, Barresi was asked by French {{nationals}} Stella Marcroft (a former girlfriend of Barresi’s) and her common law husband Philippe Lemarque to help them sell a story of allegedly having witnessed Jackson molest child actor Macaulay Culkin while under Jackson’s employ at the Neverland Ranch in 1991. They promised Barresi 10% of whatever number he could get for them, however, the offer had to be no less than $100,000. Within three days Barresi got them an offer from Jerry George at the National Enquirer of $150,000, cash on the table, however in the interim the apparently greedy French couple went over Barresi’s head by finding a Beverly Hills lawyer Arnold Kessler, who persuaded them to dismiss Barresi and refuse Enquirer’s offer; promising a much bigger <b>pay</b> <b>day</b> {{to the tune of}} a half a million dollars for their story. [...] It did not take long for Barresi to learn of the French couple's betrayal; after which he immediately went into action by secretly tapping them tell their story once again about how they allegedly saw Jackson inappropriately touching Culkin.|$|E

[...] But during the rainy weather some of them thought they had an excuse to drink. [...] They said they thought it kept them warm. [...] I saw at once that this must not go on, as a little whiskey always calls for more. [...] So I called all the Indians together in council, and explained to them that I had noticed they were beginning to look for liquor again and that it was not good for them. [...] Then I said: “I am going to make a new rule with you. [...] Every man and woman hereafter will receive only half their pay. [...] The balance will be kept in my care until near the end of the season. [...] Then those of you who think you must be spending your money all the time will have something to take home with you when your work is done.’ [...] Some, of course, did not like this plan. [...] While they knew it was for their best interest, still they did not want to do without their liquor. [...] But the majority fell right in with my proposition. [...] They knew I would be honest with them, and that their money was safe with me. [...] So it was agreed that on each <b>pay</b> <b>day</b> half of the money should be put away until the show closed. [...] Further, each man was warned that he must be more careful about drinking.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2012 {{the company}} was {{required}} by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to improve its debt collection practices, after {{it was found that}} it had sent letters to customers in 2010 accusing them of committing fraud and saying that the police might be informed. Telephone scripts used by Wonga warned borrowers working in the public or financial sectors that their terms of employment said they should not be in debt. Wonga appealed the decision and said it believed it had grounds for suspecting dishonest conduct by the specific customers to whom letters had been sent, and that they had been sent on isolated occasions more than 18 months previously and had not been sent since. It stated that it had put in place procedures to make sure similar problems did not occur in future, and that since then it referred cases of suspected fraud to an in-house team to investigate. The phone scripts had not been used since January 2010, it said. In November 2013, after being challenged repeatedly by members of parliament in a Business, Innovation and Skills select committee hearing on <b>pay</b> <b>day</b> lenders, Wonga said that they had not been censured by the OFT, but had been asked to make various changes, and that criticism by the OFT was [...] "an open issue"; the company could not say more on an ongoing process. The practice of allowing debtors to [...] "roll on" [...] an existing loan was also called into question by the MPs. Regulation for the consumer credit industry passed from the OFT to the new Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) from April 2014.|$|E

5000|$|The Chinese were repatriated only in February 1920. From {{the end of}} the war on 11 November 1918 they {{remained}} in camp at De Clijte, near Poperinge, Belgium.

30|$|One {{complication}} {{that arises}} {{from the use of}} an annual earnings measure is that the number of <b>pay</b> <b>days</b> can vary for weekly paid workers because {{of the structure of the}} calendar. For instance workers who are paid weekly would have received 53 pay cheques in 2010 if paid on Fridays but only 52 in 2009 or 2011 —resulting in a recorded earnings rise of 1.9 % between 2009 and 2010 and a cut of 1.9 % between 2010 and 2011 for workers whose weekly earnings were unchanged. We take account of this in calculating the wage rigidity measures discussed in Section 7.|$|R
