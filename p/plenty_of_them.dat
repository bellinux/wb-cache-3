25|$|Historically, unions of Protestant {{churches were}} {{enforced}} by the state, usually {{in order to have}} a stricter control over the religious sphere of its people, but also other organizational reasons. As modern Christian ecumenism progresses, unions between various Protestant traditions are becoming more and more common, resulting in a growing number of united and uniting churches. Some of the recent major examples are the United Protestant Church of France (2013) and the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (2004). As mainline Protestantism shrinks in Europe and North America due to the rise of secularism, Reformed and Lutheran denominations merge, often creating large nationwide denominations. The phenomenon is much less common among evangelical, nondenominational and charismatic churches as new ones arise and <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> remain independent of each other.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} silver was {{eliminated}} from the half dollar, it {{had been out of}} circulation for so long that banks had eliminated the slot for the denomination from machines. The Mint anticipated a comeback for the denomination, but in July 1971, Mint Director Mary Brooks disclosed that the Treasury was holding 200million of the new base metal half dollars, as commercial banks expressed little interest in ordering them. [...] "I can't understand the population. [...] They're not using them." [...] According to Brooks, most of the over one billion Kennedy half dollars containing silver had been hoarded by the public. [...] Brooks theorized that because the silver Kennedy half dollar never circulated much and few half dollars were struck in 1970 in anticipation of the authorization to eliminate silver, the public had become accustomed to not seeing the half dollar in trade. [...] Brooks suggested, [...] "If the country knew there were <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> around, they'd probably start hoarding them, too." ...|$|E

6000|$|There was an {{immediate}} hush in the room. After a few seconds a half-drunk man, with a black eye, said--"We don't want no Bibles 'ere. We've got <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> at 'ome. Bibles is only for Sundays." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So it was, lad, includin' us; but {{you don't}} suppose {{that because you}} are out on the spree, {{everybody}} else is. They're on dooty just now. Wait a bit an' you'll see <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> afore long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seems to me our {{war was a}} finer {{story than}} any you could find in Europe, {{and the best way}} to study it would be to fight it out. If you want heroes and heroines you'd have found <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eggs--potatoes and bacon--buttermilk, and potheen [21]. It's odd if I can't get <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> in Mayo, if I've nothing better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, ducks; <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> but no geese; and nobler game--even lions were there, so tame {{that little}} {{children}} could lead them." ...|$|E
60|$|There were sirens now, and <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> {{close at}} hand. Out {{of the mist}} they saw a great black hull looming.|$|E
6000|$|... "The light wouldn't {{be strong}} enough, an' steady enough," [...] {{answered}} Abe Blower. [...] "We'll {{have to have}} regular torches, and <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>'em,</b> too. Caves like thet are often full o' holes, an' ye might step into one an' fall down to Chiny, or somewhere else," [...] and he smiled, grimly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I swore I wouldn't touch a farthing's {{worth of}} her jewellery, which perhaps I {{did not think}} was worth a great deal,--but what can a woman do more than give you her all? That's the sort I like, and I know there's <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>'em.</b> And I told her to be easy about the money, for I would not pay one single farthing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Our blessed mother {{understood}} how {{to feed a}} family. Fourteen stout boys and girls, all alive and well, and you and I as smart at seventy one and two, as most folks at forty. Good, plain victuals and <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> is the secret of firm health," [...] responded Miss Jerusha, rattling a pan of buns briskly into the oven.|$|R
6000|$|... "Might have been," [...] grumbled Churchley. [...] "I {{know there}} are <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> in the building, because I once ran across one in the hall-way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will have}} <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> before you eat your next tea on shore. We pretty nigh live on them, {{when we are}} on the fishing grounds." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Psha!" [...] says Harry. [...] "I have <b>plenty</b> more <b>of</b> <b>'em.</b> There was {{no money}} in that confounded pocket-book which I lost last week." ...|$|R
6000|$|The other smiled. [...] "I always knowed you was a far-seein' feller, Thomas; but {{it stands}} to reason that Marietta's got a lot of clothes that was on hand before she went into mournin', and she's not the kind of woman to waste 'em. She'll be twistin' 'em about and makin' 'em over to suit the fashions, and it won't be like her to be buyin' new colored goods when she's got <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A hundred dollars! Do {{you take}} me for a brigand, little girl? I know what horses are worth, for I've bought <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>'em.</b> Your Joe seems sound as a dollar, and he's just in his prime. A hundred and fifty is dirt cheap for him, and the surrey will be worth at least seventy-five. Put in the harness at twenty-five, and I'll give you two-fifty for the outfit, and not a cent more or less. Eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, sir," [...] Charlie said, fearlessly. [...] "He {{will be only}} {{punishing}} his own officers. There are <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> in the King of Sweden's hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{filled up}} one another's gaps; {{and there were}} <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> towards the morning; but, luckily, people don't notice those things when the small hours draw on.' ...|$|E

6000|$|Lord Theign took, on this, with a frank show of {{reaction}} {{from some of}} his friend's terms, a sharp turn off; he even ironically indicated the babbler {{or at least the}} blunderer in question to Lady Sandgate. [...] "He too has known me so long, and he comes here to talk to me of 'the drift of public opinion'!" [...] After which he quite charged at his vain informant. [...] "Am I to tell you again that I snap my fingers at the drift of public opinion?--which is but another name for the chatter of all the fools one doesn't know, in addition to all those (and <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>'em!)</b> one damnably does." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “There {{are other}} fine {{words in the}} {{language}} such as fascination, fidelity, also frivolity; and as for invocations there are <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> too; for instance: alas, heaven help me.” ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{passed a}} {{roadside}} grocery {{with a sign}} up, [...] "Potatoes Wanted." [...] An ignorant stranger, doubtless. He could not have gone thirty steps from his place without finding <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'I believe {{twelve years}} old is the limit,' said her mother. 'Twelve- year-old girls have <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> play in <b>them,</b> Vals, haven't they, Mysie? Let me see--two hundred and thirty of them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, Mr Barret," [...] she said, rising, {{and coming}} {{forward with a}} gracious manner. [...] "It {{is only one of}} the commonest plants we have. There are <b>plenty</b> more <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> You came, I suppose, in search of my uncle? Excuse my left hand; the right, as you see, is not yet fit for duty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd like to {{see them}} all," [...] said Mrs. Ralston promptly. [...] "Let's just leave them here, Edward. Roger's family will have <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> {{presents}} without <b>them,</b> and for that matter we can send them ours when we go back home." ...|$|R

5000|$|During {{the first}} three months of the experiment, the Voguéo had [...] passengers, about a {{thousand}} a day, with <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> room for <b>them</b> all, but only a punctuality rate of about 64%. Prices were reduced to €1 to drum up trade.|$|R
6000|$|He put it as a truth {{rather more}} {{than as a}} question; {{but there had been}} <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> truths between <b>them</b> that each had contradicted. Kate, however, let this one {{sufficiently}} pass, only saying the next moment: [...] "She has behaved extraordinarily." ...|$|R
2500|$|Los Angeles Times writer Oliver Wang {{commented that}} Game Theory [...] "moves coherently {{as a whole}} and not just {{assemblage}} of spare songs". Rolling Stones Peter Relic viewed the album as a progression over their previous work and wrote [...] "For every head-nodding beat (and ?uestlove brings <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>'em),</b> Game Theory has a head-turning treat". Will Dukes of The Village Voice called it The Roots' [...] "most radical record to date" [...] and commended Black Thought for his lyricism on the album, writing [...] "Raw, emotive, and urgent as a motherfucker, his flow—on songs like opener 'False Media,' whose gangly steel snares give way to plush orchestration—is bleak and expansive and seething with wrath". Robert Christgau, writing for MSN Music, felt that the album is [...] "not hooky enough", but [...] "strong enough to compensate" [...] with a tone that [...] "maintains until the J. Dilla encomium that closes." ...|$|R
