500|$|Divorce is {{difficult}} on all parties {{involved in the}} process, including the children. Due to the stressful nature of divorce, along with inherent issues {{on the amount of}} time the children can spend with each parent, the process can have a long and lasting impact on the children. Unless the children's parents are often involved in intense conflict, or one of the parents is abusive and/or mentally ill, the children tend to fare better if the custody arrangement is a joint custody arrangement. Numerous studies have found that in joint custody arrangements, the children tend to exhibit better relationships with their families, better performance in their schools, higher levels of self-esteem, and fewer conduct and emotional issues. Further, it has been found that children that have a sole custody arrangement tend to have poorer outcomes when compared to average children (or rather children who do not have divorced parents), where children that have a joint custody arrangement tend to fare as well as average children. However, joint physical custody with an even division of time is not always necessary. These effects are generally seen simply when the children spend a substantial amount of time with both parents. According to Robert Emery, a divorce mediation expert, [...] "In many ways, joint physical custody is the ideal arrangement for children because they still have two parents very much involved in their lives." [...] This statement has been supported by <b>psychological</b> <b>data.</b> [...] Speculation that parental conflict erases the benefits of joint physical custody have not been supported by empirical research. A 2017 paper appearing in a journal published by the American Psychological Association analyzed every study that included measures and controls for conflict when comparing joint and sole physical custody families. Conflict was neither more nor less damaging for children in joint physical custody than those in sole custody. Of 16 studies that controlled for conflict when measuring children’s adjustment, only one reported worse adjustment in joint physical custody. One study found that boys did better and girls worse. Fourteen studies reported either better outcomes in joint physical custody or no differences, even after taking conflict into account.|$|E

6000|$|If we {{have been}} right in our {{analysis}} of mind, the ultimate data of psychology are only sensations and images and their relations. Beliefs, desires, volitions, and so on, appeared to us to be complex phenomena consisting of sensations and images variously interrelated. Thus (apart from certain relations) the occurrences which seem most distinctively mental, and furthest removed from physics, are, like physical objects, constructed or inferred, {{not part of the}} original stock of data in the perfected science. From both ends, therefore, the difference between physical and <b>psychological</b> <b>data</b> is diminished. Is there ultimately no difference, or do images remain as irreducibly and exclusively psychological? In view of the causal definition of the difference between images and sensations, this brings us to a new question, namely: Are the causal laws of psychology different from those of any other science, or are they really physiological? ...|$|E
60|$|Applying {{this remark}} to physiology, {{we see that}} the nerves and brain as {{physical}} objects are not truly data; they are to be replaced, in the ideal structure of science, by the sensations through which the physiologist is said to perceive them. The passage from these sensations to nerves and brain as physical objects belongs really to the initial stage in the theory of physics, and ought to be placed in the reasoned part, not in the part supposed to be observed. To say we see the nerves is like saying we hear the nightingale; both are convenient but inaccurate expressions. We hear a sound which we believe to be causally connected with the nightingale, and we see a sight which we believe to be causally connected with a nerve. But in each case it is only the sensation that ought, in strictness, to be called a datum. Now, sensations are certainly among the data of psychology. Therefore all the data of the physical sciences are also <b>psychological</b> <b>data.</b> It remains to inquire whether all the data of psychology are also data of physical science, and especially of physiology.|$|E

40|$|Highlights • The paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} over entrepreneurship research. • The paper highlights {{the role of}} culture as a driver of entrepreneurial activity. • It summarises new research on entrepreneurial culture. • This research is based on <b>psychological</b> Big <b>Data.</b> • This Big Data has delivered important new insights on entrepreneurial culture. Entrepreneurship is an important topic of our time due to its effect on economic development and social change. However, economic research struggled to explain entrepreneurial activities of regions with standard economic models, assuming perfect rationality of individuals and populations. Economic research has thus developed {{a strong interest in}} understanding the more ‘hidden’ informal institutions such as cultural factors. Here, a new generation of psychological research based on Big Data delivers a series of interesting results. Drawing from a personality-based approach to assess and to study the effects and origins of an entrepreneurial culture, this new research illustrates the great potential of <b>psychological</b> Big <b>Data</b> for economic, sociological, geographical, and psychological approaches to entrepreneurship. However, future research should employ new, complex analytic methods that utilise the full potential of Big Data...|$|R

5000|$|Psychological behaviorism {{is a form}} of behaviorism - a major theory within {{psychology}} {{which holds}} that behaviors are learned through positive and negative reinforcements. The theory recommends that psychological concepts (such as personality, learning and emotion) are to be explained in terms of observable behaviors that respond to stimulus. Behaviorism was first developed by John B. Watson (1912), who coined the term [...] "behaviorism," [...] and then B.F. Skinner who developed what is known as [...] "radical behaviorism." [...] Watson and Skinner rejected the idea that <b>psychological</b> <b>data</b> could be obtained through introspection or by an attempt to describe consciousness; all <b>psychological</b> <b>data,</b> in their view, was to be derived from the observation of outward behavior. Recently, Arthur W. Staats has proposed a psychological behaviorism - a [...] "paradigmatic behaviorist theory" [...] which argues that personality consists of a set of learned behavioral patterns, acquired through the interaction between an individual's biology, environment, cognition, and emotion. Holth also critically reviews psychological behaviorism as a [...] "path to the grand reunification of psychology and behavior analysis".|$|E
