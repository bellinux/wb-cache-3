The marketing <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is seen as having a most crucial interrelationship with the hotel total profitability and the resource allocation process for the marketing mix <b>programmes.</b> The <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is presented as a planning and control tool. A comparative example of target profit planning with discussion of its weaknesses and possible improvements is introduced Some hotel marketing budgeting techniques such as ZBB (Zero-Based Budgeting), ERC (Efficiency-Risk Coefficient), ARGE (Asset Revenue Generating Efficiency) and the CRM (Critical Ratio Method) are also presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Sector {{investment}} programmes {{have become a}} common tool in development assistance. However, their contribution to national growth of production and poverty reduction has been less investigated. The sector investments {{can be seen as}} a part of national fiscal policy, but, when run poorly, they can become a fiscal burden. Based on the evidence from running sectoral programmes, this paper recommends a thorough preparation phase for programmes, as well as the need to link sector <b>programmes</b> to national <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> If <b>programmes</b> become an integral part of the national fiscal policy, they can contribute to governments' <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> and allow for greater flexibility in terms of revenue collection and expenditure.

30|$|The principal’s {{expected}} utilities with a top-down and a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> {{are increasing}} in the earnings potential x_H. The relative attractiveness of a top-down and a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is {{captured by the}} cut-off level β ^c. For an importance of coordination below this threshold, the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> yields a higher expected utility for the principal than a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> For an importance of coordination above the threshold β ^c, the opposite is true. When the earnings potential x_H increases, the principal’s expected utilities with a top-down and a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> also increase. The increase is higher with a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> than with a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> because of imperfect coordination with a top-down budget. Therefore, the cut-off level β ^c is smaller for a higher earnings potential x_H. The range for which a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is implemented, i.e., [0,β ^c), becomes smaller when the earnings potential increases. As a consequence, {{an increase in the}} earnings potential reduces the potential use of a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> This is stated in Corollary 3 and displayed in Fig. 3.|$|R
30|$|When a {{top-down}} <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is in place, {{the agents}} are not induced to provide truthful reports. Therefore, the agents only receive incentives for providing high productive effort. The resulting rent is positive, i.e., each agent’s expected utility exceeds his reservation utility of zero (Proposition 1). In {{the case of}} a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the agents obtain additional rents, because the principal provides adapted compensation payments that induce the agents to truthfully report their private decision-relevant information. Consequently, if the agents designed the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> in date 0, they would implement a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> and obtain higher positive rents. This insight conforms with empirical findings. Practitioners would like to use more participation in the budgeting system (Libby and Lindsay 2010). Heinle et al. (2014) also illustrate that agents prefer a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> to a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> The intuition is similar. With a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the agent controls the reporting and the productive effort supply. In a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the agent only controls the productive effort supply and the principal controls the reporting. Thus, in Heinle et al. (2014), the agent receives less rents with top-down budgets than under a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> In the present paper, the agents also control the effort supply and the reporting when a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is implemented. However, for a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the control over reporting is completely set mute. This means, neither the agents nor the principal controls the reporting. The findings of Corollary  4 correspond to the results of Heinle et al. (2014), i.e., the agents obtain more rents with a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> compared to a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R
30|$|The model shows that, in {{the case}} of a low {{importance}} of coordination, the loss from imperfect coordination in a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is outweighed by the additional costs for inducing truth-telling in a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> That is, the company prefers to implement a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> and to keep the managers uninformed. For a high importance of coordination, the use of a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is optimal. The results illustrate that the company might prefer to use a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> instead of a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> However, this is not true for the managers of the divisions. The managers receive higher positive expected rents with participation than they receive with top-down budgets. Thus, the managers always prefer to have a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> in place.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature in three ways. First, it complements the insights generated by the analytical literature on managers’ participation in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> Given a budget-based bonus scheme, Magee (1980) establishes that a manager’s participation in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is detrimental for the company, because the manager maximally misreports. Baiman and Evans III (1983) highlight that the company prefers the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> only when the manager is induced to report the private decision-relevant information truthfully. Contrary to Magee (1980) and Baiman and Evans III (1983), the present paper illustrates that the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> might be preferred by the company due to lower incentive costs, although the managers report truthfully in the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> Penno (1990) finds that the company solely prefers a manager’s participation in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> when the compensation contract can be based on the reported private information. Despite basing the compensation contract on the reported private information in the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the present paper shows that the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is preferred for a low importance of coordinating the divisions’ interdependence. Kirby et al. (1991) study participation in a setting where the manager is induced to set unbiased hurdles by a compensation scheme belonging to a class of budget-based performance evaluation schemes. Participation can reduce the manager’s informational rents and, therefore, be preferred by the company. The present paper’s finding complements this result by highlighting that the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> might be preferred because of lower informational rents. Heinle et al. (2014) illustrate that the company prefers a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> whenever the level of information asymmetry between the manager and her superior is small. The present paper adds to this finding by showing the impact of the importance of coordinating the divisions’ operations on the design of the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R
30|$|In practice, {{the design}} of the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> among {{companies}} is not homogeneous (Shastri and Stout 2008). Companies can choose from a broad spectrum of design possibilities for the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> The two generic design possibilities, top-down and participative, represent the two ends of this spectrum. Lately, the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> and the associated reporting behavior of managers has attracted considerable attention by experimental research (see Shields and Young 1993; Evans III et al. 2001; Fisher et al. 2002; Hannan et al. 2006; Matuszewski 2010; Rankin et al. 2008; Altenburger 2017). A significant part of this research has focused on the consequences of participation in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> and not its antecedents (a comprehensive literature review is provided by Shields and Shields 1998). However, the reasons for the use of participation in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> have often been neglected. This paper studies the role of participation in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> if company’s divisions are confronted with interdependence. In particular, the company’s preference for implementing a top-down or a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is examined.|$|R
40|$|The <b>budget</b> <b>process</b> is {{increasingly}} considered key for reform {{efforts to improve}} fiscal outcomes. The authors embark on a political economy analysis of the <b>budget</b> <b>process</b> in Argentina, {{in the spirit of}} the IDB project "Political Institutions, Policymaking Processes and Policy Outcomes" in order to understand who determines budget outcomes in Argentina. The paper seeks to characterize the institutional framework that regulates the budget preparation, approval, implementation and control. Furthermore, it identifies which actors are involved both formally and informally in the process at each stage, and seeks to understand their incentives and interactions. The findings include the fact that the President has a de facto role that is much more powerful than what the laws and institutions of the <b>budget</b> <b>process</b> stipulate. However, the rigidity of the <b>budget</b> <b>process,</b> together with other constraints such as macroeconomic shocks, fiscal rules, agreements with International Financial Institutions and the influence of other actors such as governors, legislators and lobbies, have limited the ability of the Executive to substantially modify the <b>budget</b> <b>process.</b> The paper includes the analytical framework, and a discussion of some relevant literature on the Argentine budget process; an outline of the political and economic environment in which the <b>budget</b> <b>process</b> has evolved, and an outline of the formal rules of the <b>budget</b> <b>process.</b> Finally, an analysis of the actual workings of the <b>budget</b> <b>process,</b> and how the workings of the <b>budget</b> <b>process</b> are related to fiscal policy outcomes.

30|$|This article {{studies the}} role of {{participation}} in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> when the company has to coordinate two interdependent divisions. The focus lies on the design of the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> (top-down vs. participative budgets) and the underlying supply of information. This is studied in a principal agent model where two divisions (agents) jointly generate earnings. With the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the company (principal) implements an information system that provides the division managers with private information. Two economic effects occur. First, the company can benefit from the division managers’ private information by perfectly coordinating the divisions’ operations. Second, the company has to induce the managers to provide productive effort and with participation, to additionally report truthfully. Thus, the company incurs incentive costs. The two considered <b>budgeting</b> <b>processes</b> trade off these effects diametrically. For a low importance of coordination, the company prefers the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> and not installing an information system that allows the managers to obtain private information. Otherwise, the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is used. In contrast to the company, managers always prefer the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> In addition, the model predicts that a higher earnings potential increases the attractiveness of participative budgets.|$|R

30|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, the principal designs the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> The principal has two options for the design of the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> She can either implement a top-down (TB) or a participative (PB) <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> With a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> in place, the agents obtain private information and the principal asks the agents to report on their private information. She cannot observe whether the reports are truthful or not. The report of agent i on his private information is denoted by r_i and can either be η _L or η _H. When the principal implements a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the agents neither obtain private information nor are asked to send a report. This means, whereas, in the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the principal implements an information system that privately informs the agents about their divisions’ market fit, no information system is installed in the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> The information system can, for example, regard market research, target costing, or value engineering which is relevant for the divisions’ operations. Because specific expertise is needed for interpreting the provided information each agent can solely observe her division’s information. Installation costs of the information system are not explicitly modeled. 1 However, the implicit assumption is made that the principal does not install a costly information system in the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> because the information cannot be elicited and, thus, not used by the principal. The assumption that the agents do not obtain private information in a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is critically reflected in Sect. 6.|$|R
