40|$|Indicators were {{devised to}} {{classify}} air pollution monitoring sites {{according to the}} type of expected <b>photochemical</b> <b>pollution.</b> The indicators are based on measured ozone volume fractions, the most frequently monitored component of <b>photochemical</b> <b>pollution,</b> and in particular on two contributions: one due to the ratio of daily maximum-to-minimum ozone volume fractions and the other to observed peak values. The two contributions regarded as independent are logically connected by “ and” and therefore mathematically combined by multiplication. The criterion of classification is mainly described by the mentioned ratio and incidences of ozone volume fractions exceeding the limit of 80 ppb. Twelve monitoring stations within the European network (Cooperative programme for monitoring 1 and evaluation of long-range transmission of air pollutants in Europe, EMEP) were classified according to this indicator predicting what ozone levels can be expected at the particular sites during the growth season (April through September) into three groups: clean, medium, and polluted, based on the data for the 7 years(1997 to 2003) ...|$|E

This kind of study demands a high spatial resolution. In order to illustrate {{the influence of the}} grid resolution on tropospheric ozone levels, several simulations were carried out with MM 5 -EMICAT 2000 -CMAQ model using horizontal resolutions ranging from 8, 4 and 2 km and with 6 or 16 vertical layers during an episode of <b>photochemical</b> <b>pollution</b> (13 – 16 August 2000). High resolutions lead to improve discrete and categorical statistical parameters when evaluating the model against meteorological and air quality data. Results show that coarser grids tend to present a homogeneous and smoothened behaviour of wind flows. Also, results do not manage to describe the particularities of the circulations of the region.

40|$|Several {{times per}} year the one-hour maximum ozone {{concentration}} of 240 mug/m 3, which is the Dutch air quality guideline, is exceeded. Epidemiological studies show a relation between photochemical episodes, like ozone, {{and an increase in}} respiratory symptoms. It is important to show which effects ozone has on the respiratory tract and at which concentration these effects occur. In experimental studies in which humans are exposed to ozone, the lower airway is investigated by studying biopsies and bronchial lavage fluid (BAL). These techniques can not be applied in epidemiological studies with large healthy human populations, because the techniques are very time consuming and invasive. The nose is the prime port of entry for inspired air, and therefore, the first region of the respiratory tract that comes into contact with airborne pollutants. Nasal lavage (NAL) has helped to analyse the stage of infection, immune response or allergic reaction. A literature search was undertaken to investigate whether or not NAL is useful to determine effects of <b>photochemical</b> air <b>pollution</b> and biomarkers predicting the presence of effects of pollution in the lower respiratory tract. This literature search showed that in experimental studies to ozone and in epidemiological studies at increased concentrations of <b>photochemical</b> air <b>pollution</b> the number of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN's), like neutrophils, and to a lower extent eosinophils is increased in NAL.

40|$|Indicators {{evaluated}} {{from the}} long-term hourly averages of ozone volume fractions at air monitoring sites are proposed as {{measures of the}} <b>photochemical</b> <b>pollution</b> exposure at those sites. These indicators {{are based on the}} average of the daily maximum-to-minimum ratio during the period of maximum ozone production and are corrected a), for the average maximum to average total ozone ratio (indicator P 1) and b), for the number of hours the limit ozone volume ratio limit of 80 ppb was exceeded (indicator P 2). These indicators are then combined into P 3 as their geometrical mean. The rationale for the introduction of a new set of indicators is based on the suspicion that ozone volume fractions do not provide information either on the total daily ozone that is produced or on the fraction of it that has produced other <b>photochemical</b> <b>pollution</b> components despite that ozone correlates quite well with some of them. Unlike the European stations, where every case in excess of the 80 ppb limit occurs within the April to September "growth period", stations in the subtropics have longer periods (e. g. at Greater Baton Rouge (GBR), USA, for 2001 to 2008) are shifted towards later months June to November (e. g. the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in China for 2006). While GBR and the rural PRD stations exhibit indicators close to those of polluted stations in northern Italy (Po Valley), the (sub) urban PRD stations have high <b>photochemical</b> <b>pollution</b> indicators. However, a surprisingly low indicator level occurs for the coastal Hong Kong stations for reasons possibly attributable to the prevailing easterly winds which bring fresh air and airborne sea-salt particulates.

40|$|International audienceWe {{intend to}} build a global {{environmental}} impact indicator of air pollution to assess transport infrastructures and technologies. This indicator should be simple and transparent to facilitate its use in decision-making. The intention is for the indicator to resemble the Global Warming Potential (GWP), which establishes {{a relationship between the}} emission of six greenhouse gases and the average temperature increase of the Earth. The indicator will therefore permit estimating the global environmental impact of transport-generated air pollution, while simultaneously conserving the value of the environmental impact of each type of air pollution and the emission assessment. This work is based on an impact typology, a set of indicators, and an aggregation architecture of atmospheric pollution. The typology is established as a combination of the specific and homogenous characteristics of each type of pollution in terms of pollutant, impact mechanism, target and environmental impact. To ensure exhaustiveness and non-redundancy, 10 types of air pollution impact are proposed: greenhouse effect, ozone depletion, direct ecotoxicity (this type of pollution excludes greenhouse effects on nature, ozone depletion, eutrophication, acidification and <b>photochemical</b> <b>pollution),</b> eutrophication, acidification, <b>photochemical</b> <b>pollution,</b> restricted direct health effects (not taking into account welfare, and excluding the effects on health of the greenhouse effect, ozone depletion, acidification and <b>photochemical</b> <b>pollution),</b> sensitive pollution (annoyance caused by odours and fumes), and degradation of common and historical man-made heritage. Indicators similar to GWP can be identified in the literature for each type of atmospheric pollution, except for the degradation of common and historical man-made heritage, for which the financial cost of conservation could be used. However, these indicators do not seem to have achieved wide scientific consensus, except for GWP, which may make it necessary to continue research in this field. Aggregating the different indicators is proposed by using an architecture composed of two structures that aggregate types of air pollution. One is based on the target affected, whereas the second has three dimensions, i. e. targets, space and time. This architecture allows the indicator's users to establish a hierarchy of concerns for each type of atmospheric pollution...|$|E

Six non-smoking male students were selected from professional physical education classes at California State University; Northridge. Subjects were randomly assigned a sequence in which they received the three contaminant environments which simulated light, moderate and heavy pollution conditions, as well as a filtered air environment. Due to equipment malfunction on one occasion only three subjects experienced the heavy pollutant concentration. The investigation employed the double blind technique. An extended and varied submaximal work task on a bicycle ergometer followed a sedentary pre-work exposure to the test environment. The repeated measures design was the statistical analytical method employed in this research project. The null hypothesis stated that exposure to light or moderate concentrations of <b>photochemical</b> air <b>pollution</b> would have no significant effect upon cardiovascular, pulmonary or metabolic functions. This null hypothesis was upheld by the findings of this experiment.
