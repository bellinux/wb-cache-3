A case is reported of a unilateral paramacular chorioretinal phototrauma after cataract extraction and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. Indocyanine-green angiography (ICG-A) demonstrated the atrophy of the choriocapillaris, which was seen as a hypofluorescent area...|$|E
40|$|The eye is {{protected}} against bright light {{by the natural}} aversion response to viewing bright light sources. The aversion response normally protects the eye against injury from viewing bright light sources such as the sun, arc lamps and welding arcs, since this aversion limits the duration of exposure to {{a fraction of a}} second (about 0. 25 s). The principal retinal hazard resulting from viewing bright light sources is <b>photoretinitis,</b> e. g., solar retinitis with an accompanying scotoma which results from staring at the sun. Solar retinitis was once referred to as 'eclipse blindness' and associated 'retinal burn'. Only in recent years has it become clear that <b>photoretinitis</b> results from a photochemical injury mechanism following exposure of the retina to shorter wavelengths in the visible spectrum, i. e., violet and blue light. Prior to conclusive animal experiments at that time, it was thought to be a thermal injury mechanism. However, it has been shown conclusively that an intense exposure to short-wavelength light (hereafter referred to as 'blue light') can cause retinal injury. The product of the dose-rate and the exposure duration always must result in the same exposure dose (in joules-per-square centimeter at the retina) to produce a threshold injury. Blue-light retinal injury (<b>photoretinitis)</b> can result from viewing either an extremely bright light for a short time, or a less bright light for longer exposure periods. This characteristic of photochemical injury mechanisms is termed reciprocity and helps to distinguish these effects from thermal burns, where heat conduction requires a very intense exposure within seconds to cause a retinal coagulation otherwise, surrounding tissue conducts the heat away from the retinal image. Injury thresholds for acute injury in experimental animals for both corneal and retinal effects have been corroborated for the human eye from accident data. Occupational safety limits for exposure to UVR and bright light are based upon this knowledge. As with any photochemical injury mechanism must consider the action spectrum, which describes the relative effectiveness of different wavelengths in causing a photobiological effect. The action spectrum for photochemical retinal injury peaks at approximately 440 nm...|$|E
40|$|The {{adverse effects}} to ocular health caused by {{exposure}} {{to high levels of}} solar radiation are of great concern and can result in the severe degradation of vision capabilities. Solar radiation in the blue part of the spectrum (effectively 380 to 550 nm) is found to trigger a reaction in the eye and has been characterized by the blue light hazard. This blue light photochemical injury to the human retina is termed <b>photoretinitis.</b> <b>Photoretinitis</b> can result from either viewing an extremely bright light source for {{a short amount of time}} or a less bright source for a longer period of time. Excessive exposure to harmful blue light radiation is linked to the increased risk of macular degeneration in humans. Age related macular degeneration is recognised as the leading cause of severe blindness in the Australian population. Therefore, it is essential to decrease any exposure to damaging blue light radiation that the population experiences. Quantification of the individual level of radiation exposure requires personal dosimetry that takes into account changes in the position and orientation of people compared to the light sources. A prototype photosensitive polymer is currently being developed that can be used for the measurement of blue light exposures to humans.

40|$|This thesis {{explains}} the term „blue light“. It {{deals with the}} sources of blue light {{and the effects of}} this type of electromagnetic radiance on human body. The focus is concentrate especially on problems, which are evocated of blue light. The biggest danger is the desynchronization of circadian rhythm and photochemical damage of retina – <b>photoretinitis</b> („blue light hazard“). The basic principles of biological processes and the visual system are described here. These processes are controlled by properties of incident light onto the retina of eye. The basic information about artificial sources of blue light commonly used in households and in industry are mentioned {{in the second half of}} work. These light sources were measured and elaborated. The electromagnetic spectrums of sources are portrayed and there is a comparison of sources due circadian effect too...|$|E
