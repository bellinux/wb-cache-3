40|$|An earnest attempt {{has been}} made to devise a {{multifunctional}} system for Security. This portable system can be efficiently used for security against leakage of LPG, intruder detection and overheating. Some innovative power saving techniques has been implemented through the use of PIR sensor. Moreover, GSM acknowledgement of the parameters is achieved through the use of “SIM 900 GSM MODEM ” and a “BUZZER ” is used for local alarm. The readings and the status of the parameters are displayed on an LCD screen interfaced with the 8051 (AT 89 S 52) Micro-controller. A <b>panic</b> <b>switch</b> has been used for the emergency situation. When it is pressed, it will give both local and remote alarm. The <b>panic</b> <b>switch</b> along with the portable security system can be hidden by masking it with ordinary objects like portrait. If gas or intruder is detected or the room temperature exceeds a certain temperature limit or if the <b>panic</b> <b>switch</b> is pressed, local and remote alarm will be obtained. A rechargeable battery is used which becomes effective when the main current source is cut off. This project is designed to solve some day to day life problems of a common man providing 24 hours of security in a day...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design and}} {{implementation}} of a building automation system where communication technology LAN has been used. This paper mainly focuses on the controlling of home appliances remotely and providing security when the user is away from the place. This system provides ideal solution to the problems faced by home owners in daily life. This system provides security against intrusion as well as automates various home appliances using LAN. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system, the device such as fire sensor, gas sensor, <b>panic</b> <b>switch,</b> intruder switch along with the smartcard have been developed and evaluated with the building automation system. These techniques are successfully merged in a single building automation system. This system offers a complete, low cost powerful and user friendly way of real-time monitoring and remote control of a building...|$|E

50|$|In Transformers Ongoing, {{which takes}} place {{two years after the}} events of All Hail Megatron, the Autobots would remain on Earth as Prime feared the return of the Decepticons. Unfortunately, this led to the capture of a number of Autobots by Skywatch, {{including}} Windcharger, Gears and Prowl. Hot Rod was reformatted into a Pagani Zonda. Already frustrated, he lashed out at Optimus, accusing him of keeping the Autobots on the planet because he needed someone to protect and demanding he be allowed lead a team to rescue Prowl. An admonished Prime agreed to a covert operation, but with Ironhide along to watch over things. While Prowl was freed, it turned out the humans had used him as bait to draw the other Autobots in. However Wheeljack's new shielding protected Hot Rod's team from Skywatch's inhibitors and in a <b>panic</b> the soldiers <b>switched</b> to lethal measures. Hot Rod was targeted and Ironhide was killed protecting him. An enraged Hot Rod turned on the humans, damaging their equipment and machinery.|$|R
