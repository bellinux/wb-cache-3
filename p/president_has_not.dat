5|$|The {{day before}} Jamila's execution, Ibrahim meets with Susi, who tells him about Jamila's romantic {{involvement}} with Nurdin. Jamila became pregnant with Nurdin's child {{and insisted that}} he take responsibility, but instead Nurdin {{told her he was}} marrying someone else and humiliated her in public. When the two met in a hotel, Nurdin threatened Jamila with a pistol; in self-defence, Jamila killed him with the pistol. In the modern day, Jamila walks towards her execution; the <b>president</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> responded to the request for stay. The screen fades to black as a gunshot goes off, and afterwards, statistics about child trafficking and prostitution are shown.|$|E
25|$|The {{constitution}} makes {{specific allowances}} {{for the failure}} of a new president to be elected. If a new <b>president</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been elected by the end of a president's term, or if 30 days elapse following a vacancy, some powers are conferred upon the Prime Minister, some are moved to the chairman of the Chamber of Deputies or to the chairman of the Senate, if parliament {{is in a state of}} dissolution at the time of the vacancy.|$|E

Congress shall enact a law on who acts as president if neither of officials already stated are unable to do so.|$|E

50|$|The court objected {{that this}} {{disruption}} of its process was unconstitutional as the <b>president</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> declared martial law (while acknowledging {{that he did}} {{have the power to}} do so), but noted that it was powerless to enforce its prerogatives.|$|R
25|$|A person's {{disqualification}} {{for having}} failed to properly lodge a return of election expenses or having been convicted of an offence may be removed by the President. If the <b>President</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> done so, the disqualification ceases {{at the end of}} five years from the date when the return was required to be lodged or, as the case may be, the date when the person convicted was released from custody or the date when the fine was imposed. In addition, a person is not disqualified for acquiring or exercising rights of foreign citizenship or declared allegiance to a foreign country if he or she did so before becoming a Singapore citizen.|$|E
25|$|White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs {{said the}} effort to get a team in place {{to respond to the}} health scare has not been {{hindered}} by the lack of a secretary of Health and Human Services or appointees in any of the department’s 19 key posts. The president's nominee, Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, was still awaiting confirmation from the U.S. Senate until passing on April 28. The <b>President</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> yet made appointments to either the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, the Surgeon General, or the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The current acting Surgeon General, Steven K. Galson, is also currently serving as the Acting Assistant Secretary for Health.|$|E

2500|$|Critics of Prager {{point out}} that the United States Constitution {{provides}} [...] "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States" [...] (Article VI, section 3) and at least four <b>Presidents</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been sworn in on a Bible.|$|R
25|$|Governments and the Cortes {{sit for a}} term {{no longer}} than four years when the {{president}} tenders his resignation to the king and advises the king to dissolve the Cortes, prompting a General Election. It remains within the king's prerogative to dissolve the Cortes if, {{at the conclusion of}} the four years, the <b>president</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> asked for its dissolution, according to Title II Article 56. The president may call for earlier elections, but no sooner than a year after the prior General Election. Additionally, if the Government loses the confidence of the Cortes, then it must resign. In the event that a president dies or becomes incapacitated while in office, then the government as a whole resigns and the process of royal nomination and appointment takes place. The vice president would take over the day-to-day operations in the meantime, even while vice president himself may be nominated by the king.|$|E
2500|$|The Case for Impeachment {{sets forth}} {{multiple}} arguments why President Trump's actions warrant impeachment from office. The author organizes the book into subsets of different grounds for impeachment. These include complicity or conspiracy with foreign governments. [...] Lichtman explains {{to the reader}} the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the constitution, barring the president from taking personal monetary offerings from other governments. The author contends impeachment could be brought for actions by the president intended to benefit himself financially based on inside information about economic dealings. Lichtman observes the <b>president</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> garnered knowledge from a study of earlier key events in U.S. politics: [...] "A president {{who seems to have}} learned nothing from history is abusing and violating the public trust and setting the stage for a myriad of impeachable offenses." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Presidents</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> only {{foreign policy}} responsibilities, but sizable {{domestic}} duties too. In addition, {{the presidency is}} the head of a political party. As a result, it is tough for one person to manage disparate tasks, in one view. Many believe that this overburdened duty of presidents allows for incompetency in government.|$|R

50|$|The leak to Newsweek, presumably from TIME magazine, was {{the first}} major leak of investigative information.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa says the arrest of the former Iraqi <b>president</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> changed how Indonesia felt {{about the situation in}} Iraq. Indonesia's leaders strongly opposed the U-S-led invasion of Iraq. Indonesian leaders also said they hoped the capture of Saddam Hussein would help bring peace to Iraq and return control of the country back to its citizens.|$|R
