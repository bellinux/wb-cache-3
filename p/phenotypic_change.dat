25|$|The yeast prion PSI is {{generated}} by a conformational change of a translation termination factor, which is then inherited by daughter cells.

25|$|Prions are {{infectious}} {{forms of}} proteins. In general, proteins fold into discrete units that perform distinct cellular functions, but some proteins are also capable of forming an infectious conformational state {{known as a}} prion. Although often viewed {{in the context of}} infectious disease, prions are more loosely defined by their ability to catalytically convert other native state versions of the same protein to an infectious conformational state. It is in this latter sense that they can be viewed as epigenetic agents capable of inducing a <b>phenotypic</b> <b>change</b> without a modification of the genome.|$|E
25|$|The {{restraint}} koinophilia exerts on <b>phenotypic</b> <b>change</b> {{suggests that}} evolution can only occur if mutant mates cannot be avoided {{as a result}} of a severe scarcity of potential mates. This is most likely to occur in small restricted communities, such as on small islands, in remote valleys, lakes, river systems, caves, or during periods of glaciation, or following mass extinctions, when sudden bursts of evolution can be expected. Under these circumstances, not only is the choice of mates severely restricted, but population bottlenecks, founder effects, genetic drift and inbreeding cause rapid, random changes in the isolated population's genetic composition. Furthermore, hybridization with a related species trapped in the same isolate might introduce additional genetic changes. If an isolated population such as this survives its genetic upheavals, and subsequently expands into an unoccupied niche, or into a niche in which it has an advantage over its competitors, a new species, or subspecies, will have come in being. In geological terms this will be an abrupt event. A resumption of avoiding mutant mates will, thereafter, result, once again, in evolutionary stagnation.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{important}} {{ways in which}} epigenetic inheritance can be different from traditional genetic inheritance, with important consequences for evolution, are that rates of epimutation can be much faster than rates of mutation and the epimutations are more easily reversible. In plants, heritable DNA methylation mutations are 100.000 {{times more likely to}} occur compared to DNA mutations. An epigenetically inherited element such as the PSI+ system can act as a [...] "stop-gap", good enough for short-term adaptation that allows the lineage to survive for long enough for mutation and/or recombination to genetically assimilate the adaptive <b>phenotypic</b> <b>change.</b> The existence of this possibility increases the evolvability of a species.|$|E
2500|$|Adaptation is {{not always}} a simple matter where the ideal {{phenotype}} evolves for a given external environment. An organism must be viable at all stages of its development and at all stages of its evolution. This places constraints on the evolution of development, behavior and structure of organisms. The main constraint, over which there has been much debate, is the requirement that each genetic and <b>phenotypic</b> <b>change</b> during evolution should be relatively small, because developmental systems are so complex and interlinked. However, {{it is not clear what}} [...] "relatively small" [...] should mean, for example polyploidy in plants is a reasonably common large genetic change.

Currently, no biomarker is available to detect interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy in the renal graft at an early stage, when intervention may be beneficial. Because tubular epithelial cells have been shown to exhibit <b>phenotypic</b> <b>changes</b> suggestive of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, we studied whether these changes predict the progression of fibrosis in the allograft. Eighty-three kidney transplant recipients who had undergone a protocol graft biopsy at both 3 and 12 mo after transplantation were enrolled. De novo vimentin expression and translocation of β-catenin into the cytoplasm of tubular cells were detected on the first biopsy by immunohistochemistry. Patients with expression of these markers in ≥ 10 % of tubules at 3 mo had a higher interstitial fibrosis score at 1 yr and a greater progression of this score between 3 and 12 mo. The intensity of these <b>phenotypic</b> <b>changes</b> positively and significantly correlated with the progression of fibrosis, and multivariate analysis showed that their presence was an independent risk factor for this progression. In addition, the presence of early <b>phenotypic</b> <b>changes</b> was associated with poorer graft function 18 mo after transplantation.

40|$|Plants {{that can}} adapt their {{phenotype}} {{may be more}} likely to survive changing environmental conditions. Heritable epigenetic variation could provide a way to rapidly adapt to such changes. Here we tested whether environmental stress induces heritable, potentially adaptive <b>phenotypic</b> <b>changes</b> independent of genetic variation over few generations in Arabidopsis thaliana. We grew two accessions (Col- 0, Sha- 0) of A. thaliana for three generations under salt, heat and control conditions and tested for induced heritable <b>phenotypic</b> <b>changes</b> in the fourth generation (G 4) and in reciprocal F 1 hybrids generated in generation three. Using these crosses we further tested whether <b>phenotypic</b> <b>changes</b> were maternally or paternally transmitted. In generation five (G 5), we assessed whether phenotypic effects persisted over two generations in the absence of stress. We found that exposure to heat stress in previous generations accelerated flowering under G 4 control conditions in Sha- 0, but heritable effects disappeared in G 5 after two generations without stress exposure. Previous exposure to salt stress increased salt tolerance in one of two reciprocal F 1 hybrids. Transgenerational effects were maternally and paternally inherited. Lacking genetic variability, maternal and paternal inheritance and reversibility of transgenerational effects together indicate that stress can induce heritable, potentially adaptive <b>phenotypic</b> <b>changes,</b> probably through epigenetic mechanisms.

40|$|Maternal {{diabetes}} and high-fat feeding during pregnancy {{have been linked}} to later life outcomes in offspring. To investigate the effects of both maternal and paternal hyperglycemia on offspring phenotypes, we utilized an autosomal dominant mouse model of diabetes (hypoinsulinemic hyperglycemia in Akita mice). We determined metabolic and skeletal phenotypes in wildtype offspring of Akita mothers and fathers. Both maternal and paternal diabetes resulted in <b>phenotypic</b> <b>changes</b> in wildtype offspring. <b>Phenotypic</b> <b>changes</b> were more pronounced in male offspring than in female offspring. Maternal hyperglycemia resulted in metabolic and skeletal phenotypes in male wildtype offspring. Decreased bodyweight and impaired glucose tolerance were observed as were reduced whole body bone mineral density and reduced trabecular bone mass. <b>Phenotypic</b> <b>changes</b> in offspring of diabetic fathers differed in effect size from changes in offspring of diabetic mothers. Male wildtype offspring developed a milder metabolic phenotype, but a more severe skeletal phenotype. Female wildtype offspring of diabetic fathers were least affected. Both maternal and paternal diabetes {{led to the development of}} metabolic and skeletal changes in wildtype offspring, with a greater effect of maternal diabetes on metabolic parameters and of paternal diabetes on skeletal development. The observed changes are unlikely to derive from Mendelian inheritance, since the investigated offspring did not inherit the Akita mutation.

50|$|Phenotypic {{effects of}} mycoviral infections {{can vary from}} {{advantageous}} to deleterious, {{but most of them}} are asymptomatic or cryptic. The connection between phenotype and mycovirus presence is not always straight forward. Several reasons may account for this.

Secondly, mixed infection or unknown numbers of infecting viruses make it very difficult to associate a particular <b>phenotypic</b> <b>change</b> with the investigated virus.|$|E
50|$|When {{traits are}} {{influenced}} by either the maternal environment or the maternal phenotype, {{it is said to}} be influenced by maternal effects.

We show that chemical cues from copepods induce a response that is specific on several levels: 1) On the level of the grazer itself, i. e. its grazing impact, 2) on the level of the Alexandrium species receiving the infochemicals and 3) on the genotypic level. As specific as the infochemicals are the observed <b>phenotypic</b> <b>changes</b> in the respective species / genotype that comprise morphology and toxin production (Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning Toxins, PSTs).

However, in this report we demonstrate that MT 1 -MMP, by cleaving the underlying ECM, causes cellular aggregation of keratinocytes and SCC cells. Treatment with an MMP inhibitor abrogated MT 1 -MMP-induced <b>phenotypic</b> <b>changes,</b> but decreasing E-cadherin expression did not affect MT 1 -MMP-induced cellular aggregation. As ROCK 1 / 2 can regulate cell-cell and cell-ECM interaction, we examined its role in mediating MT 1 -MMP-induced <b>phenotypic</b> <b>changes.</b> Blocking ROCK 1 / 2 expression or activity abrogated the cellular aggregation resulting from MT 1 -MMP expression.

40|$|Background and Aims: The angiotensin-(1 - 7) /angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 /Mas {{receptor}} axis counter-regulates the {{detrimental effects}} of angiotensin II. Beneficial effects of angiotensin-(1 - 7), including anti-inflammation, oxidative stress reduction, and anti-thrombosis, have been reported. Previous studies documented that ramipril decreased thrombin generation in human hypertension {{and that the}} anti-thrombotic effects of captopril and losartan were angiotensin-(1 - 7) -dependent, suggesting an interaction between thrombin and angiotensin-(1 - 7). However, {{it is not clear}} whether angiotensin-(1 - 7) can alleviate the endothelial <b>phenotypic</b> <b>changes</b> induced by thrombin. We have previously documented cytoskeleton remodeling, cell adhesion, and cell migration as dominant altered phenotypes in thrombin-stimulated human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). In this study, we investigated whether angiotensin-(1 - 7) can modulate thrombin-induced <b>phenotypic</b> <b>changes.</b> Furthermore, we investigated whether NAPDH oxidase 5 (Nox 5) -produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a significant role in angiotensin-(1 - 7) -mediated <b>phenotypic</b> <b>changes.</b> Methods: HAECs were pretreated with 100 nM angiotensin-(1 - 7) for 1 h, followed by stimulation with 2 units/mL thrombin for different times. Immunofluorescent assay, monocyte adhesion assay, wound-healing assay, ROS assay, real-time PCR, Western blotting, and Nox 5 siRNA transfection were conducted. HAECs were pretreated with the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to determine whether thrombin-induced <b>phenotypic</b> <b>changes</b> depended on ROS production. Results: Angiotensin-(1 - 7) prevented thrombin-induced actin cytoskeleton derangements, monocyte adhesion, and migratory impairment. Nox 5 siRNA transfection confirmed that thrombin-induced Nox 5 expression stimulated ROS production and increased HO- 1 /NQO- 1 /ICAM- 1 /VCAM- 1 gene expression, all of which were decreased by angiotensin-(1 - 7). <b>Phenotypic</b> <b>changes</b> induced by thrombin were prevented by NAC pretreatment. Conclusion: Angiotensin-(1 - 7) prevents actin cytoskeleton derangement, monocyte adhesion, and migration impairment induced by thrombin via downregulation of ROS production. In addition, thrombin-induced Nox 5 expression is involved in the production of ROS, and angiotensin-(1 - 7) decreases ROS through its inhibitory effect on Nox 5 expression...|$|R

50|$|Minor {{degrees of}} {{calcification}} of the cardiovascular system {{are common in}} elderly people, and the prevalence of vascular calcification is increased by some diseases (see Epidemiology section).

Hydroxyapatite is secreted in vesicles that bleb out from vascular smooth muscle cells or pericytes in the arterial wall. The mechanism of vascular calcification is not fully understood, but probably involves a <b>phenotypic</b> <b>change</b> in the vascular smooth muscle cells in the wall with activation of bone-forming programs. Numerous regulators of calcification such as osteopontin, osteoprotegerin, matrix gla protein and fetuin-A, receptor activator of NF-kappa-B, receptor activator of NF-kappa-B ligand and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-induceing ligand protein have been implicated in this process.|$|E
