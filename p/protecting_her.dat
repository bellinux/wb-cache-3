5|$|Reproduction {{occurs in}} winter; the male stands over the female and forms a cage {{with his legs}} <b>protecting</b> <b>her</b> while she moults. Internal {{fertilisation}} takes place before the hardening of the new carapace, {{with the aid of}} two abdominal appendages (gonopods). After mating, the female retreats to a pit on the sea floor to lay her eggs. Between 250,000 and 3,000,000 fertilised eggs are held under the female's abdomen for up to eight months until they hatch.|$|E
5|$|On February 7, 2011, the premier’s office {{announced}} {{that due to}} several incidents since Dunderdale became premier in December that police bodyguards were <b>protecting</b> <b>her.</b> After her office contacted the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary (RNC) to report the incidents the RNC felt {{it was necessary to}} take precaution and assign security to the premier. Dunderdale spoke on the issue the following day, she said that due to privacy reasons she was partially reluctant to take on a bodyguard but respects the RNC’s decision. Dunderdale also said that the police had asked her not to comment on the issue and therefore she would stay mum about what led to the need for security.|$|E
5|$|Reviewer Jennifer Malkowski {{feels that}} Lana {{is one of}} the most gullible {{characters}} on television. According to Malkowski, Lana's strong feminist stance, and her request that people should stop <b>protecting</b> <b>her</b> and start telling her the truth, are diluted by her willingness to believe whatever pieces of information she gets, even if they are lies. After the series ended, Gough and Millar expressed regret with Lana's characterization throughout the course of the show, which they felt damaged Lana in the audiences' mind. Gough and Millar believed that Lana's behavior toward Clark (for refusing to reveal his secret) made her come across as cold and unsympathetic.|$|E

At 23:00, the British landed 200 seamen and all their marines on an island nearby, and also landed two 9-pounders and two howitzers that they placed in one battery, and a field piece that they placed further away. From there, {{they were able to}} engage the French in Parenza in a five-hour mutual bombardment. The brig was {{eventually}} destroyed and the men and cannons returned to their ships.

5|$|The HD remaster covers both Final Fantasy X and its sequel Final Fantasy X-2. The {{first game}} follows {{the journey of}} the {{teenager}} Tidus who is transported {{to the world of}} Spira after an encounter with a creature known as Sin. He becomes one of the guardians of the summoner Yuna, <b>protecting</b> <b>her</b> on a pilgrimage to defeat Sin and finding out how the creature is linked to Tidus' and Yuna's late fathers. Gameplay relies on the Conditional Turn-Based Battle system that allows for swapping party members in mid-combat. Characters are leveled up by means of the Sphere Grid on which the player may choose a specific skill to learn or attribute to improve. The second game is set two years after the events of X and features Yuna as a treasure hunter in search of spheres leading her to Tidus. It reintroduces the series' classic job system {{in the form of the}} Garment Grid: jobs can be acquired as dresspheres, costumes that give the player characters different abilities, throughout the game and may be changed in battle. X-2 includes multiple minigames such as Sphere Break and blitzball, the latter of which also featured prominently in X.|$|E

Replenished at Ulithi, the ships, now designated TG 38.4, were back off Okinawa {{before the end of}} the month. On 8 June, Remey joined TG 30.4 for the bombardment of Okino Daito, returned to TG 38.4 the next day, retiring to Leyte on the 11th.|$|E
25|$|Kyo is {{the heir}} to the Tengu Clan. It is {{revealed}} that Kyo is not human but a powerful demon. When he is in his demon form, his hair grown longer, has black wings, and wears a mask that looks like a crow's beak. Perverted and cocky to many, but he treats Misao with a combination of kindness and coldness depending on his mood. Kyo met Misao during their childhood; they quickly developed a strong bond and {{he fell in love with}} her. They also made a promise that she would be his bride, which he is determined to fulfill. His older brother, Sho, was supposed to be clan leader, but Kyo surpassed him for Misao's sake (as only a clan leader may seek her as their bride). In order to stay close to Misao, he moved back to his house next door to hers and took a job as a math teacher at her school. He is always <b>protecting</b> <b>her</b> and healing her wounds, also finding moments to steal a kiss. While he cares deeply for Misao, Kyo has deep attachments to those close to him: such that he took Taro under his wings to train him and make him stronger after Taro was abused by Shou. Kyo has deep disdain towards his brother (for his abusive ways) and his father (whom he suspected of murdering his mother). After Sho's death, Kyo learns that Misao is pregnant with his child, a powerful demon child. He is initially happy of the news, but when he learns that the children of the Immortal Fruit will feed on their mothers after childbirth, he wants her to abort the pregnancy but she refuses. When Misao tells him that she loves the baby and it loves her, he comes to care for the baby. Misao gives birth to a boy, whom they name Sou. Misao, by miracle, survives and Kyo is able to live happily with her and Sou.|$|E
