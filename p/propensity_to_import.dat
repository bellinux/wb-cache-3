Their estimates give no indication that the"new wave"of regionalism boosted intra-bloc trade significantly. They found convincing evidence of trade diversion only for the European Union and the European Free Trade Association. For the same blocs they also observed"export diversion", which would be consistent with these blocs'imposing a welfare cost {{on the rest of the}} world. Trade liberalization efforts in Latin America have had a positive impact on the imports of bloc members (Andean Group, Central American Common Market, Latin American Integration Association, and MERCOSUR). Increasing <b>propensities</b> <b>to</b> export generally accompanied increasing <b>propensities</b> <b>to</b> <b>import,</b> suggesting that general trade liberalization had a strong effect. The exception was MERCOSUR, for which import and export propensities displayed opposite movements, with exports performing worse than expected over the mid- 1990 s. Although MERCOSUR members have undoubtedly liberalized since the mid- 1980 s, these results suggest that their trade performance has been influenced more by competitiveness than by trade policy.

40|$|Identifying {{human and}} malaria {{parasite}} movements {{is important for}} control planning across all transmission intensities. Imported infections can reintroduce infections into areas previously free of infection, maintain ‘hotspots’ of transmission and import drug resistant strains, challenging national control programmes {{at a variety of}} temporal and spatial scales. Recent analyses based on mobile phone usage data have provided valuable insights into population and likely parasite movements within countries, but these data are restricted to sub-national analyses, leaving important cross-border movements neglected. National census data were used to analyse and model cross-border migration and movement, using East Africa as an example. ‘Hotspots’ of origin-specific immigrants from neighbouring countries were identified for Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Populations of origin-specific migrants were compared to distance from origin country borders and population size at destination, and regression models were developed to quantify and compare differences in migration patterns. Migration data were then combined with existing spatially-referenced malaria data to compare the relative propensity for cross-border malaria movement in the region. The spatial patterns and processes for immigration were different between each origin and destination country pair. Hotspots of immigration, for example, were concentrated close to origin country borders for most immigrants to Tanzania, but for Kenya, a similar pattern was only seen for Tanzanian and Ugandan immigrants. Regression model fits also differed between specific migrant groups, with some migration patterns more dependent on population size at destination and distance travelled than others. With these differences between immigration patterns and processes, and heterogeneous transmission risk in East Africa and the surrounding region, <b>propensities</b> <b>to</b> <b>import</b> malaria infections also likely show substantial variations. This was a first attempt to quantify and model cross-border movements relevant to malaria transmission and control. With national census available worldwide, this approach can be translated to construct a cross-border human and malaria movement evidence base for other malaria endemic countries. The outcomes of this study will feed into wider efforts to quantify and model human and malaria movements in endemic regions to facilitate improved intervention planning, resource allocation and collaborative policy decisions. ...|$|R

The balance of trade in fisheries remains positive but at a declining value. Using time series and cross-section data from 1970 to 1998, this paper derived the indexes of trade balance, quantity, total value and average unit prices of traded fish commodities to determine trade patterns. The analysis used some coefficients, such as market shares, <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> export, <b>import</b> reliance and revealed comparative advantage to evaluate trade performance over time.

50|$|The MPC {{is higher}} {{in the case of}} poorer people than in rich. When a person earns a higher income, the cost of their basic human needs amount to a smaller {{fraction}} of this income, and correspondingly their average <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> save is higher than that of a person with a lower income. The marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> save of the richer classes is greater than that of the poorer classes. If, at any time, it is desired to increase aggregate consumption, then the purchasing power should be transferred from the richer classes (with low <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> consume) to the poorer classes (with a higher <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> consume). Likewise, if it is desired to reduce community consumption, the purchasing power must be taken away from the poorer classes by taxing consumption. The marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> consume {{is higher in}} a poor country and lower in the case of rich country. The reason is same as stated above. In the case of rich country, most common of the basic needs of the people have already been satisfied, and all the additional increments of income are saved, resulting in a higher marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> save but in a lower marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> consume. In a poor country, on the other hand, most of the basic needs of the people remain unsatisfied so that additional increments of income go to increase consumption, resulting in a higher marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> consume and a lower marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> save.
