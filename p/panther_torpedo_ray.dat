50|$|Torpedo is a genus of rays, {{commonly}} known as electric <b>rays,</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>rays,</b> or <b>torpedoes.</b> They are slow-moving bottom-dwellers capable of generating electricity as a defense and feeding mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Ostraciiform: Ostraciiform {{swimmers}} oscillate their caudal region, {{making them}} relatively slow swimmers. Boxfish, <b>torpedo</b> <b>rays,</b> and momyrs employ Ostraciiform locomotion. The cow fish uses Osctraciiform locomotion to hover {{in the water}} column.|$|R
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray {{was described by}} American ichthyologist William Orville Ayres, the first Curator of Ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences, who named it after the U.S. state where it was first discovered by science. Ayers published his account in 1855, in the inaugural volume of the Academy's Proceedings; no type specimens were designated. In 1861, Theodore Gill placed this species in his newly created genus Tetronarce, {{on the basis of}} its smooth-rimmed spiracles. Later authors have generally regarded Tetronarce as a subgenus of Torpedo. Closely similar {{electric ray}}s found off Peru, Chile, and Japan may be the same as this species. Other common names used for this <b>ray</b> include California <b>torpedo</b> <b>ray,</b> Pacific <b>torpedo,</b> or simply electric <b>ray</b> or <b>torpedo</b> <b>ray.</b> This species is placed in the genus Tetronarce.|$|R

25|$|Electric {{fish are}} capable of {{generating}} an external electric fields or receive electric fields (electroreception). Electric fish can be further divided into three categories: strongly discharging, weakly discharging, and fish that sense but is unable to generate electric fields. Strongly electric fish generate strong electric field up to 500 volts for predatory purposes; Strongly electric fish include both marine and fresh water fishes (two freshwater taxa- African electric catfish (Malapterurus electricus) and the Neotropical electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) and the marine <b>torpedo</b> <b>rays</b> (<b>Torpedo)).</b> Weakly electric fish generates electric fields mainly for communication and electrolocation purposes; weakly electric fish are found in fresh water only and includes African freshwater Mormyridae and Gymnarchus and Neotropical electric knifefishes. Lastly, fish that are only able to detect electrical signals includes sharks, rays, skates, catfishes, {{and a number of}} other groups (see Electroreception).|$|R
5000|$|The lesser {{electric}} ray (Narcine bancroftii), {{also known as}} the Brazilian {{electric ray}}, small electric <b>ray,</b> spotted <b>torpedo</b> <b>ray,</b> torpedofish or trembler, is a species of numbfish in the family Narcinidae found on the western coastal fringes of the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. It is a small slow-moving fish, living in the surf zone of sandy or muddy beaches. Here it is easily caught as bycatch by shrimp fisheries and seine netters. As a result, its numbers have declined rapidly and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as being [...] "critically endangered".|$|R
50|$|The Gulf <b>torpedo,</b> marbled {{electric}} <b>ray,</b> {{or variable}} electric <b>ray</b> (<b>Torpedo</b> sinuspersici) is {{a species of}} electric ray in the family Torpedinidae. It {{is found in the}} Indian Ocean, but may represent a species flock of several local endemic species. It is distinguishable from other Torpedo species in its range by its ornate dorsal coloration.|$|R

50|$|In most fishes, {{electric}} {{organs are}} oriented to fire {{along the length}} of the body, usually lying {{along the length of}} the tail and within the fish's musculature, with smaller accessory electric organs in the head. However, there are some exceptions; in stargazers and in rays the electric organs are oriented along the dorso-ventral (up-down) axis. In the electric <b>torpedo</b> <b>ray,</b> the organ is near the pectoral muscles and the gills (see the image). The stargazer's electric organs lie between the mouth and the eye. In the electric catfish, the organs are located just below the skin and encase most of the body like a sheath.|$|R

500|$|André Marie Constant Duméril was {{the first}} author to refer to Torpedo as a genus, in his 1806 Zoologie analytique, ou méthode naturelle de {{classification}} des animaux. Duméril did not name any Torpedo species; the first author to do so was probably Charles Lucien Bonaparte, who assigned Linnaeus's Raja torpedo to the genus Torpedo in 1838. Since at the time T. torpedo was {{the only member of}} the genus, it became the type species. Within the genus Torpedo, the common torpedo is placed within the subgenus Torpedo, which differs from the other subgenus Tetronarce in having spiracles with [...] rims and ornate dorsal coloration. This species may also be referred colloquially to as crampfish, cramp <b>ray,</b> or <b>torpedo</b> <b>ray.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{electrostatic}} phenomena {{was again}} reported millennia later by Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by catfish and <b>torpedo</b> <b>rays.</b> Pliny in his books writes: [...] "The ancient Tuscans by their learning hold {{that there are}} nine gods that send forth lightning and those of eleven sorts." [...] This was in general the early pagan idea of lightning. The ancients held some concept that shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients suffering from ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish {{in the hope that}} the powerful jolt might cure them.|$|R

40|$|ClC {{channels}} conduct chloride (Cl-) ions across {{cell membranes}} and thereby govern the electrical activity of muscle cells and certain neurons, {{the transport of}} fluid and electrolytes across epithelia, and the acidification of intracellular vesicles. The structural basis of ClC channel gating was studied. Crystal structures of wild-type and mutant Escherichia coli ClC channels bound to a monoclonal Fab fragment reveal three Cl- binding sites within the 15 -angstrom neck of an hourglass-shaped pore. The Cl- binding site nearest the extracellular solution can be occupied either by a Cl- ion or by a glutamate carboxyl group. Mutations of this glutamate residue in <b>Torpedo</b> <b>ray</b> ClC channels alter gating in electrophysiological assays.

40|$|Thymopoietin is a {{polypeptide}} hormone of the thymus with physiological {{effects on the}} immune system and on acetylcholine-mediated transmission at the neuromuscular synapse. Elucidation of the structure and function of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor has been facilitated by the use of the electric organs of <b>Torpedo</b> <b>ray</b> or Electrophorus eel as rich sources of the receptor and by the use of snake polypeptide toxins such as alpha-bungarotoxin as highly selective labels of the acetylcholine binding site. We now show that thymopoietin binds with high affinity (Ka approximately equal to 2. 5 X 10 (9) M- 1) to the acetylcholine binding region of the acetylcholine receptor of Torpedo californica, as evidenced by similar and complete inhibition of the binding of radiolabeled thymopoietin or alpha-bungarotoxin by either of these polypeptides. These findings raise intriguing questions concerning the mechanisms whereby alpha-bungarotoxin and the thymopoietin affect acetylcholine receptor function, since these two polypeptides with such similar binding properties have very different functional effects...|$|R
40|$|The Est- 6 gene of Drosophila melanogaster was cloned by {{screening}} libraries with synthetic oligonucleotides {{corresponding to}} tryptic peptides from purified esterase- 6 (Est- 6) protein. cDNA clones were isolated that hybridized in situ {{to the site}} of Est- 6 on chromosome 3 at 69 A 1. Inserts in putative Est- 6 cDNA clones were 1. 85 kilobases (kb) long, and blot hybridization analysis of electrophoretically fractionated RNA, using a cDNA clone as a probe, revealed two transcripts, of 1. 68 and 1. 83 kb. The two transcripts showed the same developmental profile as the Est- 6 protein. Neither transcript was detected in an Est- 6 -null line. The cDNA fragment was homologous to a 2. 3 -kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment in genomic clones, and this region was interrupted by the 8 -kb B 104 transposable element in the Est- 6 -null line. Conceptual translation of the cDNA sequence revealed a protein of 548 residues with 19 % sequence similarity to acetylcholinesterase from the <b>Torpedo</b> <b>ray...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{new species}} of <b>torpedo</b> <b>ray,</b> Tetronarce cowleyi, sp. nov., is {{described}} from specimens collected from the southeastern Atlantic Ocean. The new species {{is placed in the}} genus Tetronarce based on a uniform dorsal coloration and absence of papillae around the spiracles. The new species is distinguished from its closest congeners, the North Atlantic Tetronarce nobiliana Bonnaparte, 1835, and southwestern Atlantic Tetronarce puelcha Lahille, 1926, by a combination of morpho-logical characteristics including a shorter spiracular length, a proportionally greater head length as measured between snout margin and fifth gill openings, a proportionally greater preoral snout length, a uniform shiny black or dark gray dor-sal surface, lacking any prominent markings, and a creamy white ventral color with dark edges in juveniles but fading with growth. Teteronarce cowleyi, sp. nov., is further distinguished from T. nobiliana by its more circular anterior disc shape (vs. relatively straight in T. nobiliana), fewer tooth rows (32 / 28 vs. 38 – 53 / 38 – 52 in T. nobiliana), greater mouth width (1. 5 – 1. 7 times as great as interorbital width vs. 0. 5 – 0. 6 times interorbital width in T. nobiliana), smaller distance betwee...|$|R
40|$|Members of the ClC {{family of}} {{voltage-gated}} chloride channels are found from bacteria to mammals with a considerable degree of conservation in the membrane-inserted, pore-forming region. The crystal {{structures of the}} ClC channels of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium provide a structural framework for the entire family. The ClC channels are homodimeric proteins with an overall rhombus-like shape. Each ClC dimer has two pores each contained within a single subunit. The ClC subunit consists of two roughly repeated halves that span the membrane with opposite orientations. This antiparallel architecture defines a chloride selectivity filter within the 15 -A neck of a hourglass-shaped pore. Three Cl(-) binding sites within the selectivity filter stabilize ions by interactions with alpha-helix dipoles and by chemical interactions with nitrogen atoms and hydroxyl groups of residues in the protein. The Cl(-) binding site nearest the extracellular solution can be occupied either by a Cl(-) ion or by a glutamate carboxyl group. Mutations of this glutamate residue in <b>Torpedo</b> <b>ray</b> ClC channels alter gating in electrophysiological assays. These findings reveal a form of gating in which the glutamate carboxyl group closes the pore by mimicking a Cl(-) ion...|$|R

40|$|Rapid {{communication}} at {{the chemical}} synapse {{depends on the}} action of ion channels residing in the postsynaptic membrane. The channels open transiently upon the binding of a neurotransmitter released from the presynaptic nerve terminal, eliciting an electrical response. Membrane lipids also play a vital but poorly understood role in this process of synaptic transmission. The present study examines the lipid distribution around nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors in tubular vesicles made from postsynaptic membranes of the <b>Torpedo</b> <b>ray,</b> {{taking advantage of the}} recent advances in cryo-EM. A segregated distribution of lipid molecules is found in the outer leaflet of the bilayer. Apparent cholesterol-rich patches are located in specific annular regions next to the transmembrane helices and also in a more extended `microdomain' between the apposed δ subunits of neighbouring receptors. The particular lipid distribution can be interpreted straightforwardly in relation to the gating movements revealed by an earlier time-resolved cryo-EM study, in which the membranes were exposed briefly to ACh. The results suggest that in addition to stabilizing the protein, cholesterol may play a mechanical role by conferring local rigidity to the membrane so that there is productive coupling between the extracellular and membrane domains, leading to opening of the channel...|$|R
