40|$|Commercial {{silicon carbide}} and silicon Schottky <b>barrier</b> <b>power</b> <b>diodes</b> have been {{subjected}} to 203 MeV proton irradiation and the effects of the resultant displacement damage on the I-V characteristics have been observed. Changes in forward bias I-V characteristics are reported for fluences up to 4 x 10 (exp 14) p/cm 2. For devices of both material types, the series resistance is observed to increase as the fluence increases. The changes in series resistance result from changes in the free carrier concentration due to carrier removal by the defects produced. A simple model is presented that allows calculation of the series resistance of the device and then relates the carrier removal rate to the changes in series resistance. Using this model to calculate the carrier removal rate in both materials reveals that the carrier removal rate in silicon is less than that in silicon carbide, indicating that silicon is the more radiation tolerant material...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{demand for}} {{increased}} efficiency in transportation, manufacturing equipment, and power generation and distribution {{has resulted in}} a strong research effort towards the development of solid-state devices capable of delivering large currents and withstanding high voltages without the need for bulky and expensive cooling systems. PiN diodes, used for rectification and transient suppression, have played important roles in all power electronic systems. The efficiency of these circuits can typically be improved by increasing the operating frequency. However, power lost during the switching transient of the diode also increases. Substituting Schottky <b>barrier</b> <b>diodes</b> (SBD 2 ̆ 7 s) for the standard PiN diodes in such circuits can significantly reduce overall power dissipation, since SBD 2 ̆ 7 s exhibit almost no reverse recovery transient. ^ Silicon SBD 2 ̆ 7 s are limited to applications requiring a blocking voltage less than 100 V. Due to its large bandgap and high critical field, silicon carbide (SiC) SBD 2 ̆ 7 s have been demonstrated with breakdown voltages as high as 5 kV. A recent announcement by Infineon Technologies of plans to produce SiC Schottky <b>barrier</b> <b>diodes</b> confirms the common speculation that SiC Schottky <b>barrier</b> <b>diodes</b> will become the first commercially available SiC power electronic device. However, several important issues have as yet not been fully addressed: (1) Optimization of SBD structures, (2) Definition of the boundary between the application spaces of PiN and Schottky <b>barrier</b> <b>diodes,</b> (3) Demonstration of the superior switching performance expected of SiC SBD 2 ̆ 7 s, and (4) Investigation of the impact of non-micropipe crystallographic and other electrically active defects that are known to be present in high concentrations.
