25|$|Furthermore, many cancers {{originate}} from a viral infection; {{this is especially}} true in animals such as birds, but less so in humans. 12% of human cancers can be attributed to a viral infection. The mode of virally induced tumors can be divided into two, acutely transforming or slowly transforming. In acutely transforming viruses, the viral particles carry a gene that encodes for an overactive oncogene called viral-oncogene (v-onc), and the infected cell is transformed as soon as v-onc is expressed. In contrast, in slowly transforming viruses, the virus genome is inserted, especially as viral genome insertion is obligatory part of retroviruses, near a <b>proto-oncogene</b> in the host genome. The viral promoter or other transcription regulation elements, in turn, cause over-expression of that <b>proto-oncogene,</b> which, in turn, induces uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Because viral genome insertion is not specific to proto-oncogenes and the chance of insertion near that <b>proto-oncogene</b> is low, slowly transforming viruses have very long tumor latency compared to acutely transforming virus, which already carries the viral-oncogene.|$|E
40|$|Short SurveyThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] evidence strongly suggests that cancer is a genetic disease, arising from mutations in DNA. These mutations alter the function or synthesis of two groups of proteins, which are the products of either <b>proto-oncogenes</b> or anti-oncogenes. Of the more than 30 <b>proto-oncogenes</b> identified, ras <b>proto-oncogenes</b> are most frequently found to be mutationally activated (to oncogenes) in human tumours. Developments leading to current understanding of the function of ras <b>proto-oncogenes</b> and of the retinoblastoma anti-oncogene are reviewed. Based on the involvement of all known oncogenes and anti-oncogenes in cellular signal transduction pathways, {{it is suggested that}} a general model for cancer at the molecular level may become a reality.

25|$|Mutations in <b>proto-oncogenes,</b> {{which are}} the {{normally}} quiescent counterparts of oncogenes, can modify their expression and function, increasing the amount or activity of the product protein. When this happens, the <b>proto-oncogenes</b> become oncogenes, and this transition upsets the normal balance of cell cycle regulation in the cell, making uncontrolled growth possible. The chance of cancer cannot be reduced by removing <b>proto-oncogenes</b> from the genome, even if this were possible, as they are critical for growth, repair and homeostasis of the organism. It is only when they become mutated that the signals for growth become excessive.|$|R
50|$|Retroviruses {{that cause}} tumor growth include Rous sarcoma virus and Mouse mammary tumor virus. Cancer can be {{triggered}} by <b>proto-oncogenes</b> that were mistakenly incorporated into proviral DNA or by the disruption of cellular <b>proto-oncogenes.</b> Rous sarcoma virus contains the src gene that triggers tumor formation. Later {{it was found that}} a similar gene in cells is involved in cell signaling, which was most likely excised with the proviral DNA. Nontransforming viruses can randomly insert their DNA into <b>proto-oncogenes,</b> disrupting the expression of proteins that regulate the cell cycle. The promoter of the provirus DNA can also cause over expression of regulatory genes.|$|R

25|$|Transgene use {{in humans}} is {{currently}} fraught with issues. Transformation of genes into human cells {{has not been}} perfected yet. The most famous example of this involved certain patients developing T-cell leukemia after being treated for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID).

25|$|Mutations (DNA changes) in the RET <b>proto-oncogene,</b> {{located on}} {{chromosome}} 10, {{lead to the}} expression of a mutated receptor tyrosine kinase protein, termed RET (REarranged during Transfection). RET is involved in the regulation of cell growth and development and its germline mutation is responsible for nearly all cases of hereditary or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Its germline mutation may also be responsible for the development of hyperparathyroidism and pheochromocytoma. Hereditary medullary thyroid cancer is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, meaning that each child of an affected parent has a 50% probability of inheriting the mutant RET <b>proto-oncogene</b> from the affected parent. DNA analysis makes it possible to identify children who carry the mutant gene; surgical removal of the thyroid in children who carry the mutant gene is curative if the entire thyroid gland is removed at an early age, before there is spread of the tumor. The parathyroid tumors and pheochromocytomas are removed when they cause clinical symptomatology. Hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2) accounts for approximately 25% of all medullary thyroid carcinomas.|$|E
25|$|In 1975 the {{functioning}} of oncoviruses was clarified considerably. Until that time, {{it was thought that}} these viruses carried certain genes called oncogenes which, when inserted into the host's genome, would cause cancer. Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus showed that the oncogene of Rous sarcoma virus is in fact not specific to the virus but is contained in the genome of healthy animals of many species. The oncovirus can switch this pre-existing benign <b>proto-oncogene</b> on, turning it into a true oncogene that causes cancer.|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} decade an {{avalanche}} of evidence has implicated <b>proto-oncogenes</b> in the control of cell proliferation. Products of <b>proto-oncogenes</b> include many of the secreted growth factors and cell surface receptors that mediate intercellular signaling events (Aaronson, 1991), the components of cytoplasmic pathways that interpret those signals (Cantley et al., 1991), and the nuclear factors that execute their commands through transcriptional regulation (Lewin, 1991). We are now witnessing a similar outpouring {{of support for the}} parallel notion that genes important in carcinogenesis are central to pattern formation in the embryo or differentiation in cell lineages.

25|$|Usually, oncogenes are dominant, as {{they contain}} gain-of-function mutations, while mutated tumor {{suppressors}} are recessive, as they contain loss-of-function mutations. Each cell has {{two copies of}} the same gene, one from each parent, and under most cases gain of function mutations in just one copy of a particular <b>proto-oncogene</b> {{is enough to make}} that gene a true oncogene. On the other hand, loss of function mutations need to happen in both copies of a tumor suppressor gene to render that gene completely non-functional. However, cases exist in which one mutated copy of a tumor suppressor gene can render the other, wild-type copy non-functional. This phenomenon is called the dominant negative effect and is observed in many p53 mutations.|$|E
25|$|Viral {{oncogenesis}} {{are most}} common with DNA and RNA tumor viruses, most frequently the retroviruses. There {{are two types}} of oncogenic retroviruses: acute transforming viruses and non-acute transforming viruses. Acute transforming viruses induce a rapid tumor growth since they carry viral oncogenes in their DNA/RNA to induce such growth. An example of an acute transforming virus is the Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) that carry the v-src oncogene. v-Src is part of the c-src, which is a cellular <b>proto-oncogene</b> that stimulates rapid cell growth and expansion. A non-acute transforming virus on the other hand induces a slow tumor growth, since it does not carry any viral oncogenes. It induces tumor growth by transcriptionally activating the proto-oncogenes particularly the long terminal repeat (LTR) in the proto-oncogenes.|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{can be seen}} as a {{disturbance}} in the homeostatic balance between cell growth and cell death. Over-expression of anti-apoptotic genes, and under-expression of pro-apoptotic genes, can result in the lack of cell death that is characteristic of cancer. An example can be seen in lymphomas. The over-expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in lymphocytes alone does not cause cancer. But simultaneous over-expression of Bcl-2 and the <b>proto-oncogene</b> myc may produce aggressive B-cell malignancies including lymphoma. In follicular lymphoma, a chromosomal translocation commonly occurs between the fourteenth and the eighteenth chromosomes — t(14;18) — which places the Bcl-2 gene from chromosome 18 next to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. This fusion gene is deregulated, leading to the transcription of excessively high levels of Bcl-2. This decreases the propensity of these cells for apoptosis.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, {{technical}} advances in molecular biology {{have led to a}} vast increase in our understanding of cancer. In particular, the discovery of two types of genes, <b>proto-oncogenes</b> and tumour suppressor genes (TSGs), have underpinned our expanding comprehension of the abnormalities that distinguish cancer cells from their normal counterparts. Broadly speaking, <b>proto-oncogenes</b> direct cells towards proliferation and prolonged survival, whereas tumour suppressor genes tend to inhibit, or keep in check, cell growth and survival. During normal development, tissue homeostasis requires a fine balance between these processes, whereas the equilibrium in tumour cells is disturbed, with the growth imperative taking over.

40|$|Cancer cells contain {{genetic damage}} of two sorts (Bishop 1991) : dominant, with targets known as proto-oncogenes; and recessive, with targets known most {{commonly}} as tumor suppressor genes. The lesions in <b>proto-oncogenes</b> cause an unwanted gain of function, whereas {{the damage to}} tumor suppressor genes typical-ly causes loss of function. <b>Proto-oncogenes</b> and tumor suppressor genes are generally thought of as governors of cellular proliferation, with the former serving as accelerators, the latter as brakes. Jam an accelerator or remove a brake, and the cell is unleashed to relentless division. Useful as this view may be, it is erroneously simplistic. In reality, many <b>proto-oncogenes</b> and at least some tumor suppressor genes have diverse, even paradoxical functions that vary with cellular and phys-iological context: There is plasticity in the machine. Until we can understand the nature and genesis of that plasticity, {{it is unlikely that}} we will be able to fully understand the biochemical maladies of cancer cells. The plasticity displayed by <b>proto-oncogenes</b> is better understood than that of tumor suppressor genes and is based on the physiological role of these genes in the lives of metazoan organisms. The proteins encoded by <b>proto-oncogenes</b> serve as relays or junction boxes in the elaborate biochemical circuitry that governs the pheno-type of eukaryotic ells (Cantley et al. 1991). That circuitry is designed to permit extravagant pleiotropism in the response to extracellular signals.

25|$|Beta-catenin is a <b>proto-oncogene.</b> Mutations of {{this gene}} are {{commonly}} found {{in a variety of}} cancers: in primary hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, ovarial carcinoma, breast cancer, lung cancer and glioblastoma. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of all tissue samples sequenced from all cancers display mutations in the CTNNB1 gene. Most of these mutations cluster on a tiny area of the N-terminal segment of β-catenin: the β-TrCP binding motif. Loss-of-function mutations of this motif essentially make ubiquitinylation and degradation of β-catenin impossible. It will cause β-catenin to translocate to the nucleus without any external stimulus and continuously drive transcription of its target genes. Increased nuclear β-catenin levels have also been noted in basal cell carcinoma (BCC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), prostate cancer (CaP), pilomatrixoma (PTR) and medulloblastoma (MDB) These observations may or may not implicate a mutation in the β-catenin gene: other Wnt pathway components can also be faulty.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThree {{discrete}} {{forms of}} {{feline leukemia virus}} (FeLV) -associated lymphoma have been described clinically: (1) thymic, (2) alimentary, and (3) multicentric. The most common and best-characterized lymphomas are of T-cell origin, generally occurring in the thymus. These tumors typically contain mature T-cells, involve the activation of a distinctive set of <b>proto-oncogenes,</b> and contain FeLV proviruses whose long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences contain tandemly repeated enhancers. Previous studies {{of a small group}} of extrathymic, multicentric lymphomas implicated a different set of genetic determinants. The present study expands those observations by examining the lineage of origin, the involvement of <b>proto-oncogenes,</b> and the structure of LTR andenvgene sequences in a set of 11 natural, extrathymic lymphomas of the multicentric type. A pattern of genetic events associated with FeLV-positive multicentric lymphomas emerges from this analysis that is clearly distinct from the pattern associated with thymic lymphomas. The tumors do not contain T-cells or B-cells, as evidenced by the germ line organization of TCRβ and IgH loci. <b>Proto-oncogenes</b> strongly implicated in T-cell lymphomagenesis are not involved in these tumors. Rather, a distinct set of <b>proto-oncogenes</b> may be involved. Most striking is the repeated occurrence of an FeLV isolate whose LTR andenvgene bear unique sequence elements...|$|R
40|$|Oncogenes are {{activated}} through well-known chromosomal alterations such as gene fusion, translocation, and focal amplification. In {{light of}} recent {{evidence that the}} control of key genes depends on chromosome structures called insulated neighborhoods, we investigated whether <b>proto-oncogenes</b> occur within these structures and whether oncogene activation can occur via disruption of insulated neighborhood boundaries in cancer cells. We mapped insulated neighborhoods in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and found that tumor cell genomes contain recurrent microdeletions that eliminate the boundary sites of insulated neighborhoods containing prominent T-ALL <b>proto-oncogenes.</b> Perturbation of such boundaries in nonmalignant cells was sufficient to activate <b>proto-oncogenes.</b> Mutations affecting chromosome neighborhood boundaries were found in many types of cancer. Thus, oncogene activation can occur via genetic alterations that disrupt insulated neighborhoods in malignant cells. National Institutes of Health (U. S.)
