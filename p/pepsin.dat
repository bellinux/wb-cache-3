5|$|Gastric acid acts as {{a barrier}} against {{microorganisms}} to prevent infections and {{is important for the}} digestion of food. Its low pH denatures proteins and thereby makes them susceptible to degradation by digestive enzymes such as <b>pepsin.</b> The low pH also activates the enzyme precursor pepsinogen into the active enzyme <b>pepsin</b> by self-cleavage. After leaving the stomach, the hydrochloric acid of the chyme is neutralized in the duodenum by sodium bicarbonate.|$|E
5|$|The {{biochemical}} {{identity of}} enzymes was still {{unknown in the}} early 1900s. Many scientists observed that enzymatic activity was associated with proteins, but others (such as Nobel laureate Richard Willstätter) argued that proteins were merely carriers for the true enzymes and that proteins per se were incapable of catalysis. In 1926, James B. Sumner showed that the enzyme urease was a pure protein and crystallized it; he did likewise for the enzyme catalase in 1937. The conclusion that pure proteins can be enzymes was definitively demonstrated by John Howard Northrop and Wendell Meredith Stanley, {{who worked on the}} digestive enzymes <b>pepsin</b> (1930), trypsin and chymotrypsin. These three scientists were awarded the 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Redback {{antivenom}} {{was developed}} by Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, then a government body involved with discovering antivenoms for many venomous Australian creatures. Production involves the milking of venom from redbacks and repeatedly inoculating horses with non-lethal doses. The horse immune systems makes polyclonal antibodies. Blood plasma, containing the antibodies, is extracted by plasmapheresis. The plasma is treated with <b>pepsin,</b> and the active F(ab')2 fragments are separated and purified. Each vial contains 500 units of redback antivenom in approximately 1.5 ml, which is enough to inactivate 5mg of redback spider venom in a test tube. The antivenom has been safely administered to women {{in various stages of}} pregnancy. Redback antivenom has been widely used in Australia since 1956, although evidence from controlled studies for its effectiveness has been lacking. Recent trials show antivenom has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics. Further studies are needed to confirm or refute its effectiveness. It appears clinically active against arachnidism caused by Steatoda spiders; however, as these cases are often mild and the evidence of its effectiveness is limited, this treatment is not recommended. Similarly, the antivenom has been reported as effective with bites of L. katipo, and L. tredecimguttatus. Animal studies also support its use against envenomation from other widow spiders, having successfully been tested against venom from L. mactans, L. hesperus, and L. tredecimguttatus (synonym L.lugubris).|$|E

The major pepsinogen and two of these minor pepsinogens were studied in detail. All three zymogens have N-terminal Ser-Val-, C-terminal -Val-Ala and not more than 1 mol of glucose/mol of protein; {{no significant differences in}} amino acid composition were found. The pepsinogens differ in their organic phosphate content, which accounts for their chromatographic separation. By activation at 0 °C and pH 2, a corresponding series of <b>pepsins</b> is formed. These enzymes were separated by hydroxyapatite chromatography at pH 5. 7. All the <b>pepsins</b> have N-terminal valine, C-terminal alanine and are free from carbohydrate.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND In {{patients}} with heartburn persisting despite proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, reflux oesophagitis is rarely found and its pathogenesis has been scarcely studied. AIM To assess reflux parameters by impedance-pH monitoring in PPI-resistant reflux oesophagitis. METHODS Impedance-pH monitoring {{was performed on}} PPI therapy in {{patients with}} symptomatic reflux oesophagitis detected despite standard or high-dose PPI therapy of at least 8 -week duration. RESULTS Twenty patients, ten on once daily and ten on twice daily PPI regimens, were studied. The gastric acid exposure time (percent time pH 30 % in 70 % of cases but the oesophageal acid exposure time (percent time pH < 4) was abnormal in 20 % of patients only. The number of acid, weakly acidic and weakly alkaline refluxes was abnormal in 25 %, 100 % and 15 % of patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Weakly acidic refluxes were above the normal range in all cases whereas acid reflux parameters and weakly alkaline refluxes were normal {{in the vast majority}} of cases. Gastric acid secretion, with consequent intra-gastric <b>pepsins</b> activation, persists despite ongoing PPI therapy and activated <b>pepsins</b> may well be present in weakly acidic refluxes. As activated <b>pepsins</b> maintain their proteolytic activity in a weakly acidic environment, they may be responsible for mucosal damage. We conclude that weakly acidic refluxes have a major role in the pathogenesis of PPI-resistant reflux oesophagitis. Therapeutic interventions in patients with PPI-resistant reflux oesophagitis should be tailored on the basis of impedance pH-monitoring results...|$|R

25|$|Peptides {{longer than}} about 50-70 amino acids long cannot be sequenced {{reliably}} by the Edman degradation. Because of this, long protein chains {{need to be}} broken up into small fragments that can then be sequenced individually.

30|$|Enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} {{is carried}} out from one to several hours at mild conditions: slightly elevated temperatures (generally around 35 – 65  °C) and a certain pH according to the optimal requirements of the used enzymatic systems: alkali (for example, alcalase), neutral (papain, bromelain, alcalase, neutrase and flavourzyme) or acid (<b>pepsins).</b> Used for FPH production enzymes are of animal (<b>pepsins),</b> plant (papain, bromelain) or microbial origin (alcalase, neutrase, flavourzyme). Enzymes of microbial origin are considered as having greater pH and temperature stability (He et al. 2013). The application of enzymes allows obtaining a high-quality FPH avoiding such drawbacks as the developing of undesirable products of racemization as {{in a case of}} acid and alkali hydrolysis (Gonzalez-Tello et al. 1994). In addition, enzymatic hydrolysis allows a controllable distraction of a certain type of proteins by a certain chain cleavage due to enzymes’ specificity with an easy process of enzyme inactivation after a certain DH is achieved (Pasupuleti and Braun 2010). The inactivation of enzymatic hydrolysis is typically accomplished by the elevated temperatures of around 75 – 100  °C applied for 5 – 30  min (Kristinsson and Rasco 2000).|$|R

Probe manufacturers provide instructions for cleaning and maintaining their probe designs. For illustration, one maker of laboratory-grade pH gives cleaning instructions for specific contaminants: general cleaning (15-minute soak in a solution of bleach and detergent), salt (hydrochloric acid solution followed by sodium hydroxide and water), grease (detergent or methanol), clogged reference junction (KCl solution), protein deposits (<b>pepsin</b> and HCl, 1% solution), and air bubbles.|$|E

40|$|Background: Aspartic proteases {{comprise}} {{a large group}} of enzymes involved in peptide proteolysis. This collection includes prominent enzymes globally categorized as <b>pepsins,</b> which are derived from pepsinogen precursors. <b>Pepsins</b> are involved in gastric digestion, a hallmark of vertebrate physiology. An important member among the pepsinogens is pepsinogen C (Pgc). A particular aspect of Pgc is its apparent single copy status, which contrasts with the numerous gene copies found for example in pepsinogen A (Pga). Although gene sequences with similarity to Pgc have been described in some vertebrate groups, no exhaustive evolutionary framework has been considered so far. Methodology/Principal Findings: By combining phylogenetics and genomic analysis, we find an unexpected Pgc diversity in the vertebrate sub-phylum. We were able to reconstruct gene duplication timings relative to the divergence of major vertebrate clades. Before tetrapod divergence, a single Pgc gene tandemly expanded to produce two gene lineages (Pgbc and Pgc 2). These have been differentially retained in various classes. Accordingly, we find Pgc 2 in sauropsids, amphibians and marsupials, but not in eutherian mammals. Pgbc was retained in amphibians, but duplicated in the ancestor of amniotes giving rise to Pgb and Pgc 1. The latter was retained in mammals and probably in reptiles and marsupials but not in birds. Pgb was kept in all of the amniote clade with independent episodes of loss in some mammalian species. Lineage specific expansions of Pgc 2 and Pgbc have also occurred in marsupials and amphibians respectively. We find that teleost an...|$|R
50|$|Eukaryotic aspartic proteases include <b>pepsins,</b> cathepsins, and renins. They have a two-domain structure, {{arising from}} ancestral duplication.

Each domain contributes a catalytic Asp residue, with an extended active site cleft localized between the two lobes of the molecule. One lobe has probably evolved from the other through a gene duplication event in the distant past.

25|$|In {{the human}} {{digestive}} system, a bolus (a small rounded mass of chewed up food) enters the stomach through the oesophagus via the lower oesophageal sphincter. The stomach releases proteases (protein-digesting enzymes such as <b>pepsin)</b> and hydrochloric acid, which kills or inhibits bacteria {{and provides the}} acidic pH of 2 for the proteases to work. Food is churned by the stomach through muscular contractions of the wall called peristalsis – reducing {{the volume of the}} fundus, before looping around the fundus and the body of stomach as the boluses are converted into chyme (partially digested food). Chyme slowly passes through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum of the small intestine, where the extraction of nutrients begins. Depending on the quantity and contents of the meal, the stomach will digest the food into chyme within anywhere between forty minutes and a few hours. The average human stomach can comfortably hold about a litre of food.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} {{digestive}} system, food enters {{the mouth and}} mechanical digestion of the food starts {{by the action of}} mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be {{in the form of a}} small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and <b>pepsin.</b> As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes.|$|E
