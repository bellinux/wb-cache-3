5|$|In 2006, {{following}} {{a move to}} Epic Records, Simpson released her fifth studio album, A Public Affair. The album debuted and peaked at number 5 in the US and was certified gold by the RIAA. A Public Affair has sold just over 500,000 copies in the US and spawned three singles. The album's title track, the second single from the album, reached number 14 on the Hot 100 and topped the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. The single was eventually certified gold by the RIAA. After deciding {{to return to her}} roots of country music in 2008, Simpson signed a record deal with Columbia Nashville, the country imprint of Columbia Records, and released Do You Know, her sixth studio and first country album. The album debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 and number 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, and has shifted 350,000 copies. Simpson had departed from Sony Music by 2010 and signed a record deal with Eleveneleven records. In October 2010, Sony released a compilation album entitled Playlist: The Very Best of Jessica Simpson. Her seventh studio and second holiday album, Happy Christmas, was released in November 2010 through <b>Primary</b> <b>Wave.</b> The album peaked at number 123 on the Billboard 200.|$|E

The share of Nirvana's publishing was purchased by <b>Primary</b> <b>Wave</b> Music, which was founded by Larry Mestel, a former CEO of Virgin Records. In an accompanying statement, Love sought to assure Nirvana's fanbase that the music would not simply be licensed to the highest bidder, noting, [...] "We are going to remain very tasteful and true {{to the spirit of}} Nirvana while taking the music to places it has never been before". Further releases have since been made. This includes the DVD releases of Live! Tonight! Sold Out!! in 2006, and the full, uncut version of MTV Unplugged in New York in 2007. The band's performance at the 1992 Reading Festival was released on both CD and DVD as Live at Reading in November 2009. That month, Sub Pop released a 20th anniversary deluxe edition of Bleach, and DGC released a number of 20th anniversary deluxe-edition packages of both Nevermind in September 2011, and In Utero in September 2013.|$|E

40|$|Shoaling wave fields {{generated}} in laboratory experiments were analyzed {{to determine the}} sensitivity of nonlinear interactions to the directional distributions of incident waves. Peaks in the directional spectra observed in shallow water were consistent with near resonating, quadratic interactions between two <b>primary</b> <b>waves</b> transferring energy to a third wave with the sum frequency and vector sum wavenumber of the <b>primary</b> <b>waves.</b> Directionally colinear waves forced a higher-frequency wave propagating {{in the same direction}} as the <b>primary</b> <b>waves,</b> while directionally spread (i. e., noncolinear) <b>primary</b> <b>waves</b> forced a higher-frequency wave that propagated in a direction between those of the interacting <b>primary</b> <b>waves.</b> Deepwater wave fields with similar frequency spectra but different directional spectra evolved to different shallow-water directional spectra, yet their shallow-water frequency spectra were remarkably similar. This result suggests that the shape of the directional spectrum of the incident wave field has only a small effect on the magnitudes of nonlinear energy transfer during shoaling. The principal effect of directionality in the incident wave field is on the directions, not the amplitudes, of the nonlinearly generated waves. The laboratory data demonstrate clearly the importance of triad interactions between noncolinear and colinear shoaling waves...|$|R

500|$|Nirvana {{was formed}} in 1987 by vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, with the {{position}} of drummer being filled by various musicians. The band released its debut album, Bleach, in 1989 on independent label Sub Pop. After being joined by final drummer Dave Grohl and signing to Geffen Records subsidiary DGC Records, the band released its second studio album, Nevermind, which {{became one of the}} best selling alternative albums of the 1990s and popularized the Seattle grunge movement and alternative music. The band's third album, In Utero, was also a commercial and critical success, though it did not match the sales precedent set by Nevermind—as the members of the band expected. Nirvana disbanded in 1994 after the death of Cobain; since then several posthumous releases have been issued from the band, which once resulted in a legal conflict between Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, and the surviving members of the band over the release of the song [...] "You Know You're Right". In March 2006, Love sold a significant share of the rights to Nirvana's publishing catalog to Larry Mestel of <b>Primary</b> <b>Wave</b> Music Publishing. Since its debut, the band has sold 27.6 million albums in the United States alone, and over 80 million records worldwide.|$|E

40|$|Propagation of an {{atmospheric}} {{gravity wave}} (AGW) in a wind field is studied by numerical simulation. Two models are applied: {{the first is}} a linear model to check with the gravity wave theory; the second is a quasi-nonlinear model to study the char-acteristics of the secondary waves produced by the interactions between two gravity wave packets. The magnitudes and directions of the vertical phase and group velocities obtained by linear simulation are consistent with the prediction of linear gravity wave theory. That is, the vertical propagation velocities of the phase and the energy of an AGW are always opposite to each other. In the quasi-nonlinear model, two <b>primary</b> <b>waves</b> are forced to oscillate at the ground level with their group velocities upward and phase velocities downward, which creates two secondary waves by the interaction be-tween the <b>primary</b> <b>waves.</b> The smaller one is found to have group velocity upward and phase velocity downward just {{the same as that of}} the two <b>primary</b> <b>waves.</b> The group velocity of the larger one is found to be downward always, while its phase velocity is upward when the <b>primary</b> <b>waves</b> in the source region are still oscillating and becomes downward after the <b>primary</b> <b>waves</b> stop oscillation. The result reveals that the smaller one is a production of a resonant interaction; while the larger one is the production of a non-resonant interaction. Both secondary waves do not follow the dispersion relation of the linear theory.

40|$|We present SDO/AIA {{observations}} of the interaction of a global EUV wave on 2011 June 7 with active regions (ARs), coronal holes (CHs) and coronal bright structures. The <b>primary</b> global <b>wave</b> has a three-dimensional dome shape, with propagation speeds ranging from 430 - 780 km/s in different directions. The <b>primary</b> coronal <b>wave</b> runs {{in front of the}} expanding loops involved in the CME and its propagation speeds are approximately constant within 10 - 20 minutes. Upon arrival at an AR on its path, the <b>primary</b> EUV <b>wave</b> apparently disappears and a secondary wave rapidly reemerges 75 Mm within the AR boundary at a similar speed. When the EUV wave encounters a coronal bright structure, an additional wave front appears there and propagates in front of it at a velocity nearly a factor of 2 faster. Reflected waves from a polar CH and a coronal bright structure are observed and propagate fractionally slower than the <b>primary</b> <b>waves.</b> Some of these phenomena can be equally explained by either a wave or non-wave model alone. However, taken together, these observations provide new evidence for the multitudes of global EUV waves, in which a true MHD fast-mode wave or shock propagates in front of an expanding CME bubble.

40|$|Accurate {{generation}} of the <b>primary</b> <b>waves</b> and the reproduction of the group-induced second-order low and high frequency waves have been considered essential for physical i. e. model test in the laboratory. In the laboratory when multi-chromatic <b>primary</b> <b>waves</b> are generated the required bounded waves will be generated naturally at the difference frequencies. In addition to that several unwanted free waves are also generated. The free waves, having the same frequencies of the bounded waves are reproduced due to mismatch of the boundary conditions at the wave paddle. The other two types of free waves are due to the wave paddle displacement and the local disturbances. We carried out physical experiments to identify the second order spurious waves in shallow water in the Offshore Engineering Basin (OEB) at the Institute for Ocean Technology (IOT) of National Research Council (NRC) Canada. In the basin water depths {{in the range of}} 0. 4 m to 0. 6 m are used for the experiments. The peak wave periods also have varied from 1. 133 s to 2. 145 s.

40|$|To {{determine}} the stress state of a wire rope is tedious although analytical solution {{of a simple}} rope subjected to static load is available. While facing the problems involving complex ropes, it is usual practice to take approximations based upon the concepts of an average stress state for the constitutive ropes or for every wire. For a statically loaded cable superimposed with a tensile impulse, practically in sudden lifting of a heavy weight, the coupled axial-shearing strain waves in the cable has rarely been studied and explored through analytical approaches. Based on Costello's force-deformation relationship and elastic wave propagation theory, analysis procedures and results are presented in this paper. Time-dependent coupled axial-torsional displacements and axial-shearing strain waves in a simple straight wire rope, due to a longitudinal impact at one end, are obtained. At the instance of the strike, a pair of coupled <b>primary</b> axial-torsional <b>waves</b> is created and begins to travel in the cable independently with different speed.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{interaction between}} counterpropagating Alfven waves is the physical mechanism underlying the cascade {{of energy to}} small scales in astrophysical plasma turbulence. Beginning with the equations for incompressible MHD, an asymptotic analytical solution for the nonlinear evolution of these Alfven wave collisions is derived in the weakly nonlinear limit. The resulting qualitative picture of nonlinear energy transfer due to this mechanism involves two steps: first, the <b>primary</b> counterpropagating Alfven <b>waves</b> interact to generate an inherently nonlinear, purely magnetic secondary fluctuation with no parallel variation; second, the two <b>primary</b> <b>waves</b> each interact with this secondary fluctuation to transfer energy secularly to two tertiary Alfven waves. These tertiary modes are linear Alfven waves with the same parallel wavenumber as the <b>primary</b> <b>waves,</b> indicating {{the lack of a}} parallel cascade. The amplitude of these tertiary modes increases linearly with time due to the coherent nature of the resonant four-wave interaction responsible for the nonlinear energy transfer. The implications of this analytical solution for turbulence in astrophysical plasmas is discussed.
