5|$|John Shaw {{and other}} historians, {{military}} and civilian, have based {{the conclusions of}} their work on the incursion on the <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia had been so badly damaged that it was rendered ineffective. The next large-scale North Vietnamese offensive, the Nguyen Hue Offensive of 1972 (called the Easter Offensive in the West) would be launched out of southern North Vietnam and western Laos, not from Cambodia, was cited as proof positive that the Cambodian operations had succeeded. The fact that PAVN forces were otherwise occupied in Cambodia and had no such offensive plan (so far as is known) was seemingly irrelevant. The fact that logistically, a northern offensive (especially a conventional one backed by armour and heavy artillery) would be launched closer to its source of manpower and supply also seemed to be of little consequence.|$|E
5|$|At the {{invitation}} of {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr, Bohr visited the Manhattan Project sites in November 1943. Groves offered Bohr substantial pay, but Bohr initially refused the offer because {{he wanted to make sure}} that the relationship between the United States and Great Britain remained a real cooperative partnership. In December 1943, after a meeting with Albert Einstein, Bohr and his son Aage committed to working on the Manhattan Project. Bohr made a substantial contribution to the atomic bomb development effort. He also attempted to prevent an atomic arms race with the Soviet Union after the war, which he believed to be a serious threat. In 1944, Bohr made several key points he believed to be essential towards international nuclear weapon control. He urged that Britain and the United States should inform the Soviet Union about the Manhattan Project in order to decrease the likelihood of it feeling threatened on the <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other nations were building a bomb behind their back. His beliefs stemmed from the fact that he was convinced the Russians already knew about the Manhattan Project, which therefore led him to believe that there was no point in hiding it from them.|$|E

25|$|While {{all five}} judges are {{properly}} seen {{as among the}} framers of the Constitution, it was Higgins J who had taken {{a leading role in the}} Constitutional Conventions for the federal government the power to make laws relating to the conciliation and arbitration of industrial disputes. As with the judgement of Isaacs J in Whybrow (No 1), Higgins J argues from the <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fundamental basis of the Australian legal system was that power was conferred on the Federal Parliament, not by the people of Australia but by the British parliament. Higgins J rejected the <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> parties to the dispute needed to have taken a definite stand or made definite claims, but that an order or award could not be made except as against identified or identifiable parties.|$|E
25|$|Islamic {{astronomy}} {{was developed}} {{on the basis}} of a spherical earth inherited from Hellenistic astronomy.

25|$|The non-Homeric epics {{are usually}} {{regarded}} as {{later than the}} Iliad and Odyssey. There is no reliable evidence for this, however, and some Neoanalyst scholars operate on the <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Homeric epics were later than the Cyclic epics and drew on them extensively. Other Neoanalysts make the milder claim that the Homeric epics draw on legendary material which later crystallized into the Epic Cycle. This is an ongoing debate.|$|E
25|$|South Africa has a {{progressive}} income taxation system {{which is based}} on the <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wealthy should contribute a greater proportion towards supporting the State than the poor. This means that the more a person earns the higher percentage tax they pay. By law all employers have to register all employees as taxpayers regardless of their tax liability. In terms of individual income tax South Africans pay the 31st highest average income tax rate in the world.|$|E

During {{the course of the}} strike, 13 strikers were killed and 57 were wounded. An estimated $340,000 worth of property damage occurred during the strike.

5000|$|Pan-{{nationalism}} {{is a form}} {{of nationalism}} distinguished by being associated with a claimed national territory which does not correspond to existing political boundaries.

25|$|Eventually, {{generative}} semantics spawned {{an alternative}} linguistic paradigm, known as cognitive linguistics, which attempts to correlate {{the understanding of}} language together with the biological function of specific neural structures. Whereas generative semanticists function on the <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mind has a unique and independent module for language acquisition, cognitive linguists deny this. Instead, they assert that the processing of linguistic phenomena is informed by conceptual deep structures—and more significantly—that the cognitive abilities used to process this data {{are similar to those}} used in other non-linguistic tasks. Much of this work is published today under neurolinguistics.|$|E
25|$|After Shemp {{rejoined the}} act, Moe, Shemp, and Larry shot a {{television}} pilot for ABC called Jerks of All Trades (1949), apparently intended {{to lead to}} a weekly sitcom series on the <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Stooges would try a different job or business every week, hoping that eventually one of their attempts would be successful. Anything they tried {{turned out to be a}} fiasco, which was the source of the comedy. The pilot took a single day to film and was never aired. It was actually a kinescope film of a three camera television production, most likely to replicate a proposed live broadcast.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} debt fell {{into three categories}} after the American Revolution. The first was the $12 million owed to foreigners, mostly money borrowed from France. There was general agreement to pay the foreign debts at full value. The national government owed $40 million and state governments owed $25 million to Americans who had sold food, horses, and supplies to the revolutionary forces. There were also other debts that consisted of promissory notes issued during the Revolutionary War to soldiers, merchants, and farmers who accepted these payments on the <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new Constitution would create a government that would pay these debts eventually.|$|E
