500|$|Before Lois {{prepares to}} undergo in vitro fertilization, Dr. Hartman shows her several photos of babies {{conceived}} by celebrity couples, including actress Shelley Duvall and singer-songwriter James Blunt; actress Hilary Swank and actor Gary Busey; Olympic medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner and physicist Stephen Hawking; and actress, writer and comedian Tina Fey and actor Joaquin Phoenix. Beginning the procedure, Lois objects to Dr. Hartman's method of embryonic insertion. In response, he replies, [...] "Well, <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> tell them—if only you spoke Hovitos," [...] {{a reference to}} Raiders of the Lost Ark. Later, {{in an attempt to}} cause Lois to have a miscarriage, Peter lays down a series of Grey's Anatomy DVDs in order to lure Lois into being punched in the stomach by the [...] "Acme Miscarriage Kit", a boxing glove attached to a crossbow. In a reference to the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoon series Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner, Peter ultimately ends up missing with the crossbow, causing the glove to bounce and hit a large rock and land inches in front of him as he is standing on a narrow cliff. The ground then drops out from underneath his feet, causing him to fall like Wile E. Coyote.|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I {{interrupting}} a {{very important}} interview?" [...] she asked calmly. [...] "If not, <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> spare me five minutes of your time, Sir Julien?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don't you tackle her?" [...] Master Roberts suggested. [...] "She'll be so busy lookin' at your uniform that <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> make {{a better}} trade." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank <b>you,</b> sir. <b>Perhaps,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be so {{very kind}} as {{to tell me}} to whom I am to apply in town; for I shall go thither to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Aye! Set forth. That’s <b>perhaps</b> what <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do. Couldn’t <b>you</b> now? There’s no {{sea life}} in this connection. But {{you can put it}} in out of your head—if you like.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{mean to say}} {{you have}} {{forgotten}} the case?" [...] he resumed. [...] "We called it hysteria, not knowing what else it was. I don't forgive the girl for slipping through our fingers; I hate to be beaten by Death, in that way. Have you made up your mind what to do, on the next occasion? <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have saved her life {{if you had been}} sent for, now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It may be you can. I am {{on my way}} to Meeker's Mill for {{a little}} outing. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> tell me where Meeker's Mill is, and how I can best get there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose I was to {{give you}} a look in, say, at half arter ten to-morrow morning. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> name the figures of a few wiolincellers of a good tone?" [...] says Mr. Bucket.|$|E
6000|$|... "Referring to your {{advertisement}} in this morning's paper, I {{may be able}} to be of {{some use}} to you. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> call and see me at the above address at eleven o'clock to-morrow morning.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But,' said Anne diffidently, {{seeing that}} her cousin {{was in a}} graver mood this evening, 'do not <b>you</b> think that <b>perhaps</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{be a little more}} companionable to Kate, and not say things so evidently for the sake of contradiction, you might gain a little useful influence?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{you will}} take charge of a letter? <b>Perhaps,</b> too, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see him yourself; and tell him--you see I trust you with everything-- that my fortune, his own fortune, depends on his being here to- morrow morning. He must start to-night, sir--to-night, tell him, if there were twenty Miss Lavingtons in Whitford--or he is a ruined man!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You thundering old lunatic," [...] said Cashel, {{rising and}} putting on his hat; [...] "is it likely that I want a pair of mufflers? <b>Perhaps</b> <b>YOU</b> think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> teach me {{something}} with them. Ha! ha! By-the-bye--now mind this, Mellish--don't let it out down here that I'm a fighting man. Do you hear?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you ride}} on to Brussels?" [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "I can wait here [...] . . . and <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> send a {{conveyance}} for me later on. M. le Comte de Cambray would [...] . . ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot, Otter; I am {{bound and}} in a prison above you. There is {{a hole in the}} floor, {{and if you have a}} rope, as I heard you say, <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> climb up to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{want to get}} a room. We {{have been}} lodging {{together}} in London, and don't know anyone down here. I thought <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> tell us of some quiet, respectable people who have a room to let?" ...|$|E
60|$|At Pont de Montvert, on the 12th of August, he had {{his right}} hand {{stricken}} from his body, and was burned alive. And his soul was like a garden? So perhaps was the soul of Du Chayla, the Christian martyr. And <b>perhaps</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> read in my soul, or I could read in yours, our own composure might seem little less surprising.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It wouldn't {{make much}} difference, Sir,' said Mrs. King. 'You see I am {{up a good}} deal most nights with Alfred, and we have fire and candle almost always alight. I should only be glad {{to do it for}} a poor motherless lad like that, except for the cost; and I thought <b>perhaps</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> speak to the Guardians, they might allow him ever so little, because there will be expenses.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can I prove it? Can any {{one else}} prove it?" [...] he said jovially. [...] "Prove with what? What do I want to prove? There isn't a single {{corner in the}} world, barring England, <b>perhaps,</b> where <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not find some man, or more likely woman, that would {{remember}} me for Harry Hagberd. I am more like Harry Hagberd than any man alive; and I can prove it {{to you in a}} minute, if you will let me step inside your gate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{best man}} was more excited than Joe was," [...] said Susan. [...] "He wished Miranda many happy returns of the day. She {{did not look}} very happy, but <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not expect that under the circumstances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing, sir," [...] said Frank. He {{paused for}} a moment, and then resumed--"Well, there is {{something}} that <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do, sir. I have a little brother out of employment; if you could get him a situation, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We shall see, fair cousin,' he answered, {{with an odd}} satirical bow; 'we are as Heaven made us. All lies in the {{management}} {{and if you had}} the advantages of training, <b>PERHAPS</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> even turn your height into a grace.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{had better}} get him onto a sofa, sir," [...] whispered the attendant, presently. [...] "Not very heavy. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> and I <b>could</b> manage." [...] It {{was when he was}} being lifted that Savine first showed signs of intelligence. He glanced at Geoffrey and {{attempted}} to beckon towards the room they had left. When he seemed slightly better, Thurston said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet {{your heart}} has gone there already, Macumazahn, {{and you must}} follow your heart. Does not the image which was carved with the knife you gave, hold a white heart in its hand, and {{although}} {{it seems to be}} but a bit of Umzimbeete wood, is it not alive and bewitched, which <b>perhaps</b> is why <b>you</b> <b>could</b> never make up your mind to burn it, Macumazahn?" ...|$|R
40|$|Imagine a {{world without}} legally {{enforceable}} contracts. Could such a world function? Well, even if it could, commercial life in particular would be much less certain. Let’s say that you ordered a book from a website. You gave the seller your credit card details, they charged the agreed amount to the account, but did not send you the book. In {{a world without}} legally enforceable contracts there would <b>perhaps</b> be little <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do about it...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have a missal here," [...] {{the priest}} said carelessly, [...] "that has {{somewhat}} troubled me, being written in a cramped hand. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> read it for me," [...] and, getting up, he took a roll from a closet.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} a quandary I was in about a friend of mine. He wants my {{judgment}} in a case something like yours, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> help me with an opinion; for women are very wise in such matters sometimes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May I {{not help}} you to pick up these sheets? I see that you have {{numbered}} them all. I will keep them in their proper order. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> trust {{me to do that}} while you went and packed your bag?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here {{is a large}} map of {{the country}} {{you will have to}} traverse. You had best take it into the next room, and study it carefully; {{especially}} the course and direction of the rivers, and the points of crossing. It would be shorter, <b>perhaps,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have gone by boat south to Arcachon and thence made your way to Nerac; but there are wide dunes to be crossed, and pine forests to be traversed, where a stranger might well die of hunger and thirst. The people, too, are wild and savage, and look upon strangers with great suspicion; and would probably have no compunction in cutting your throat. Moreover, the Catholics have a flotilla {{at the mouth of the}} Gironde, and there would be difficulty and danger in passing.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{when you}} said just now that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> stand here alone, seeing and hearing, until--until--and then stopped, <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> wished to say that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> remain here until you {{understood}} it all, and knew the meaning of that mysterious pain in your heart?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--but you {{understand}} one thing by staying with me; and I understand another. <b>You,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> <b>could</b> {{make up your}} mind to be about my hand and chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt. I suppose I should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so? Come--tell me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> tell me that, Macumazahn, who, he says, {{are such}} {{an old friend}} of his; also why he chooses to sojourn in a dark hole among the dead instead of in the {{sunshine}} among the living, here at Ulundi." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, of course, if {{you think}} so, I wouldn't advise you to the contrary; only, if so, Mr. Flannelly must foreclose at once, {{in which case the}} {{property}} would be sold out and out; but <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> effect a loan in time--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{that we do}} not know," [...] {{said the}} officer. [...] "Strange things have {{happened}} in the cell of your companion in the pits of Manator. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> pass through a locked door of skeel as easily as he performs seemingly more impossible feats." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are talking}} like a gent, sir," [...] the man said,--"like a {{sensible}} gent, too. I'd {{have to keep}} it quiet, of course, that I'd come into a bit of money,--just at present, at any rate. I could easy find an excuse for changing my job--perhaps get away from London altogether. I've got a few pounds saved and I've always wanted to open a banking account. A gent like <b>you,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> <b>could</b> put me in the way of doing it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't {{you find}} any mark on her clothes," [...] asked Euphemia, [...] "by which <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{discover}} her parentage? If {{there are no}} initials, <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> can find a coronet or a coat of arms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't begin that. You did {{the best}} <b>you</b> <b>could</b> [...] To keep him--though <b>perhaps</b> <b>you</b> didn't quite [...] Conceal a wish to see him show the spunk [...] To disobey you. Much his wife'll thank you." ...|$|R
