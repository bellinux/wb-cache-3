5|$|Officially, {{the entire}} length of I-75 in Michigan is the American Legion Memorial Highway. As a <b>practical</b> <b>matter,</b> this name is not used on the southernmost {{segments}} of the Interstate. The American Legion was honored with the designation in 1969 in a state law that required private interests to finance the signage. Public Act174 of 1984 redesignated I-75 in honor of the group and placed responsibility for signage in MDOT's hands. Another name that was applied to all of I-75 was the Michigan Bicentennial Freedom Way. Designated by Senate Concurrent Resolution216 of 1975, the name only applied to the freeway in 1976. The designation was formally repealed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The Clause {{has led to}} {{very little}} litigation, {{in part because of}} its overlap (as a <b>practical</b> <b>matter)</b> with the venue {{provision}} of Article Three and Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Further, {{with the exception of the}} District of Wyoming, which includes the portions of Yellowstone National Park in Idaho and Montana, no federal judicial district includes the territory of two or more states (although the short-lived District of Potomac once did).|$|E
5|$|The primary {{issue of}} {{debate within the}} {{sovereignty}} movement became on what terms sovereignty would be put before the electorate. Parizeau, long identified with the independantiste wing of the party, was opposed to the PQ's general historical preference for an economic relationship {{with the rest of}} Canada to be offered alongside sovereignty, as he thought this would encourage the Federal government to simply refuse to negotiate and cast the project as doomed, as had happened in 1980. As a <b>practical</b> <b>matter,</b> Parizeau believed that given the emotional circumstances of separation a special partnership was unlikely, and that given free trade agreements and other multilateral institutions it was unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|In addition, the Air Force was {{tasked with}} {{gathering}} intelligence, air reconnaissance, and air transport. Support of ground troops, both doctrinally {{and as a}} <b>practical</b> <b>matter,</b> became marginal. These missions were strongly influenced by a shrinking capability, since its combat aircraft could operate by daylight only, its anti-aircraft artillery was obsolete, and the FLORIDA radar system had reached the limits of operational effectiveness. The retirement of the Hawker Hunters in 1994ended its ground support capability, and a cut of one-third from the defence budget meant that plans for a second purchase of F/A-18s and supporting air-to-ground weapons (the reason the multi-capable Hornet was selected) had to be canceled, leaving both it and the F-5s in a strictly air-to-air role.|$|E

25|$|On October 3, 1821, the Captaincy General of Guatemala (formed of Chiapas, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras) proclaimed its {{independence}} from Spain and its incorporation into the Mexican Empire. The region had been formally subject to New Spain throughout the colonial period, but as a <b>practical</b> <b>matter,</b> it was administered separately. All but Chiapas soon separated from Mexico.|$|E
25|$|As a <b>practical</b> <b>matter,</b> {{prior to}} the passage of Dodd–Frank, {{investment}} advisers were not required to register with the SEC if the investment adviser had fewer than 15 clients during the previous 12 months and did not hold itself out generally to the public as an investment adviser. The act eliminates that exemption, thereby rendering numerous additional investment advisers, hedge funds, and private equity firms subject to new registration requirements.|$|E

25|$|On 15 September 1821, the Captaincy General of Guatemala, {{formed by}} Chiapas, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras, officially proclaimed its {{independence}} from Spain. The Captaincy-general was dissolved two years later. This region was formally {{a part of the}} Viceroyalty of New Spain throughout the colonial period, but as a <b>practical</b> <b>matter</b> had been administered separately. It was not until 1825 that Guatemala created its own flag.|$|E
25|$|Although the new {{government}} at first did not grant formal recognition {{to any of the}} various anti-Napoleonic governing juntas in Spain, as a <b>practical</b> <b>matter</b> it accepted the authority of the Junta of Seville, and followed all of its directives. When victories over the French allowed a measure of unification of control in Spain, New Spain recognized the Junta of Aranjuez. Garibay sent a donation of 200,000 pesos to Aranjuez as a contribution to the war, in addition to the 90,000 pesos of the regular payment.|$|E
25|$|Cash {{settlement}} − a {{cash payment}} is made {{based on the}} underlying reference rate, such as a short-term interest rate index such as 90 Day T-Bills, or the closing value of a stock market index. The parties settle by paying/receiving the loss/gain related to the contract in cash when the contract expires. Cash settled futures are those that, as a <b>practical</b> <b>matter,</b> could not be settled by delivery of the referenced item—for example, {{it would be impossible}} to deliver an index. A futures contract might also opt to settle against an index based on trade in a related spot market. ICE Brent futures use this method.|$|E

25|$|Being a small {{minority}} usually leads to functional bilingualism. Swedish-speaking Finns are more fluent in Finnish than Finnish-speakers are in Swedish due to the <b>practical</b> <b>matter</b> {{of living in a}} predominantly Finnish-speaking country. Although in some municipalities Swedish is the only official language, Finnish is the dominant language in most towns and at most employers in Finland. In areas with a Finnish-speaking majority, Finnish is most often used when interacting with strangers and known Finnish speakers. However, 50% of all Swedish speakers live in areas in which Swedish is the majority language and in which they can use Swedish in all or most contexts (see demographics below).|$|E
25|$|This {{is not to}} {{say that}} common law is better in every situation. For example, civil law can be clearer than case law when the {{legislature}} has had the foresight and diligence to address the precise set of facts applicable to a particular situation. For that reason, civil law statutes tend to be somewhat more detailed than statutes written by common law legislatures—but, conversely, that tends to make the statute more difficult to read (the United States tax code is an example). Nonetheless, as a <b>practical</b> <b>matter,</b> no civil law legislature can ever address the full spectrum of factual possibilities in the breadth, depth and detail of the case law of the common law courts of even a smaller jurisdiction, and that deeper, more complete body of law provides additional predictability that promotes commerce.|$|E
25|$|As a <b>practical</b> <b>matter,</b> the {{conventional}} International Date Line—or another {{line in the}} Pacific Ocean close to it—serves as a de facto date line for purposes of Jewish law, at least in existing Jewish communities. For example, residents of the Jewish communities of Japan, New Zealand, Hawaii, and French Polynesia all observe Shabbat on local Saturday. However, there is not unanimity as to how Jewish law reaches that conclusion. For this reason, some authorities rule that certain aspects of Sabbath observance are required on Sunday (in Japan and New Zealand) or Friday (in Hawaii and French Polynesia) in addition to Saturday. Additionally, there are differences of opinion as to which day or days individual Jews traveling in the Pacific region away from established Jewish communities should observe Shabbat.|$|E

25|$|The Department is {{administered}} and {{governed by the}} Police Commissioner, who is appointed by the Mayor. Technically, the commissioner serves a five-year term; as a <b>practical</b> <b>matter,</b> the commissioner serves at the Mayor's pleasure. The commissioner in turn appoints numerous deputy commissioners. The commissioner and his subordinate deputies are civilians under an oath of office and are not uniformed members of the force who are sworn officers of the law. However, a police commissioner who comes up from the uniformed ranks retains that status while serving as police commissioner. This has ramifications for their police pensions {{and the fact that}} any police commissioner who is considered sworn does not need a pistol permit to carry a firearm, and does retain the statutory powers of a police officer. Some police commissioners (like Ray Kelly) do carry a personal firearm, but they also have a full-time security detail from the Police Commissioner's (Detective) Squad.|$|E
25|$|Mexico's {{inability}} to obtain better results in locating children and taking parents is particularly troubling. Many Convention return applications forwarded by the U.S. Central Authority have languished for years; when children and taking {{parents are not}} located, Mexican courts will not rule on the application. As a result, and despite persistent efforts by the U.S. Central Authority to prompt Mexican authorities to address these cases, numerous parents have waited for years with no contact or information about the whereabouts of their children. Of the return applications submitted to the Mexican Central Authority that remained unresolved after eighteen months or longer, approximately half remain in limbo because Mexican authorities have not located the children. As a <b>practical</b> <b>matter,</b> the left-behind parent or someone working on his/her behalf must develop most leads pertaining to the possible location of abducted children {{without the help of}} Mexican authorities. In some cases, Mexican authorities profess an {{inability to}} find children even when the family or the U.S. Embassy has shared concrete information with the Mexican Central Authority on the child's whereabouts.|$|E
