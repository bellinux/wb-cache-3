5|$|Among {{the oldest}} rocks in Oregon, {{some of the}} {{formations}} in these terranes date to the Triassic, nearly 250million years ago. Between 165 and 170million years ago, in the Jurassic, faulting consolidated the Klamath terranes offshore during what geologists call the Siskiyou orogeny. This three- to five-million-year episode of intense tectonic activity pushed sedimentary rocks deep enough into the mantle to melt them and then forced them to the surface as granitic plutons. Belts of plutons, which contain gold and other precious metals, run through the Klamaths and include the Ashland <b>pluton,</b> the Grayback batholith east of Oregon Caves National Monument, the Grants Pass <b>pluton,</b> the Gold Hill <b>pluton,</b> the Jacksonville <b>pluton,</b> and others. Miners have worked rich deposits of gold, silver, copper, nickel, and other metals in several districts of the Klamaths. Placer mining in the mid-19thcentury soon led to lode mining for gold. Aside from a mine in eastern Oregon, the Greenback Mine along Grave Creek, a Rogue tributary, was the most productive gold mine in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, due {{to issues}} {{caused by the}} transmission, the French Army began to {{modernize}} its fleet of tanks to AMX-30B2 standards, which included a new transmission, an improved engine {{and the introduction of}} a new fin-stabilized kinetic energy penetrator. Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants, including the AMX-30D armored recovery vehicle, the AMX-30R anti-aircraft gun system, a bridge-layer, the <b>Pluton</b> tactical nuclear missile launcher and a surface-to-air missile launcher.|$|E
5|$|A mass {{of granite}} {{now in the}} Panamint Mountains intruded this complex 1400 mya. Pegmatic dikes and other widely spaced plutons of granite {{are also in the}} complex (a <b>pluton</b> is a large blob of magma deep {{underground}} and dikes are projections of that). Outcrops can be seen along the front of the Black Mountains in Death Valley and in the Talc and Ibex Hills. When the granite was being intruded, the west coast of North America ran through Eastern California and through an embayment that spread toward the Las Vegas Valley. This embayment, called the Amargosa aulacogen, had highlands north and south of it and {{was the result of a}} failed rift. Many thousands of feet of sediment filled the slowly subsiding basin.|$|E
50|$|Anorthosite <b>plutons</b> {{occur in}} a wide range of sizes. Some smaller <b>plutons,</b> {{exemplified}} by many anorthosite bodies in the U.S. and Harris in Scotland, cover only a few dozen square kilometres. Larger <b>plutons,</b> like the Mt. Lister Anorthosite, in northern Labrador, Canada, cover several thousands of square kilometres.|$|R

50|$|The Elqui-Limarí Batholith is a {{group of}} <b>plutons</b> in the Andes of Chile and Argentina between the latitudes of 28 and 30° S. The <b>plutons</b> of the {{batholith}} were emplaced and cooled in the Late Paleozoic and the earliest Mesozoic. Some of the <b>plutons</b> were emplaced in a context of crustal thickening related to the San Rafael orogeny.|$|R
5|$|Occupying {{the extreme}} eastern {{position}} of the blockade, Indiana fired at the cruisers Infanta María Teresa and Almirante Oquendo {{as they left the}} harbor, but, due to engine problems, was unable {{to keep up with the}} Spanish cruisers as they fled to the west. When the Spanish destroyers <b>Plutón</b> and Furor emerged, Indiana was near the harbor entrance and, together with Iowa, she supported the armed yacht Gloucester in the destruction of the lightly armored enemy ships. She was then ordered to keep up the blockade of the harbor in case more Spanish ships came out and so played no role in the chase and sinking of the two remaining Spanish cruisers, Vizcaya and Cristóbal Colón.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pluton</b> {{spent much}} of 1933–1935 in {{dockyard}} hands after finishing her first round of modifications on 27 April 1933. She was refitted four times during this period to add more gunnery equipment and to rectify some of her defects. These included reinforcement of her superstructure {{where it had been}} damaged by the muzzle blast from her 138mm guns and replacement of her corroded aluminum ladders and booms with steel ones. A high-angle fire-control director for her 75mm guns was added, two of her 75mm gun were converted to powered, remotely controlled mounts, gun shields were added to the 75mm guns to protect their crews from blast and facilities for another 40 men was installed on her mine deck.|$|E
5|$|Indiana {{served in}} the Spanish–American War (1898) {{as part of the}} North Atlantic Squadron. She took part in both the {{blockade}} of Santiago de Cuba and the battle of Santiago de Cuba, which occurred when the Spanish fleet attempted to break through the blockade. Although unable to join the chase of the escaping Spanish cruisers, she was partly responsible for the destruction of the Spanish destroyers <b>Plutón</b> and Furor. After the war she quickly became obsolete—despite several modernizations—and spent most of her time in commission as a training ship or in the reserve fleet, with her last commission during World War I as a training ship for gun crews. She was decommissioned for the third and final time in January 1919 and was shortly after reclassified Coast Battleship Number 1 so that the name Indiana could be reused. She was sunk in shallow water as a target in aerial bombing tests in 1920 and her hull was sold for scrap in 1924.|$|E
40|$|Prior {{investigations}} concur {{that the}} granite <b>plutons</b> in Scotland which {{are most likely}} to prove favourable for geothermal exploration are the Ballater, Bennachie, Cairngorm and Mount Battock <b>plutons,</b> all of which have heat production values greater than 5  μW m− 3. This heat production arises from the significant concentrations of potassium, uranium and thorium in some granite <b>plutons.</b> A new field-based gamma-ray spectrometric survey targeted <b>plutons</b> that were poorly surveyed in the past or near areas of high heat demand. This survey identifies several other <b>plutons</b> (Ben Rhinnes, Cheviot, Hill of Fare, Lochnagar and Monadhliath) with heat production rates between 3 and 5  μW m− 3 that could well have geothermal gradients sufficient for direct heat use rather than higher temperatures required for electricity generation. The Criffel and Cheviot <b>plutons</b> are examples of Scottish granites that have concentric compositional zonation and some zones have significantly higher (up to 20...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} rock types in <b>plutons</b> are granite, granodiorite, tonalite, monzonite, and quartz diorite. Generally light colored, {{coarse-grained}} <b>plutons</b> of these compositions {{are referred to}} as granitoids.|$|R
50|$|The Vicuña Mackenna Batholith (Batolito Vicuña Mackenna) is a {{group of}} <b>plutons</b> in the Chilean Coast Range of {{northern}} Chile. The <b>plutons</b> of the batholith formed (cooled) between the Early Jurassic and the Late Cretaceous (192-98 Ma). The magmas that formed the batholith originated in Earth's mantle and have not suffered any significant crustal contamination. A group of Early Cretaceous <b>plutons</b> were intruded syn-tectonically on Atacama Fault.|$|R
5|$|Originally, 300 AMX-30s {{were ordered}} by the French Army, and by 1971 the order had been {{increased}} to 900, divided between eight batches, including all variants based on the chassis. Beginning in 1966, ten AMX-30s were assembled per month, and the first five were issued in August 1966 to the 501st Régiment de Chars de Combat. Monthly production grew to 15–20 tanks as new factories began to manufacture components of the vehicle and existing factories increased their production potential. However, in April 1969, production was again reduced to ten per month. By 1971, about 180 vehicles were in service; in 1975 delivery began of the last 143 units of the final eighth batch of the original order. In 1985, the number of AMX-30s had risen to 1,173. By the end of production, France had accepted 1,355 AMX-30s into service, including 166 brand-new AMX-30B2s. Another 493 tanks were refitted and modernized to AMX-30B2 standards; originally 271 new and 820 refitted vehicles had been planned. The French Army also accepted {{a large number of}} variants, including 195 self-propelled howitzers, 44 AMX-30 <b>Pluton</b> tactical nuclear missile launchers, 183 AMX-30Rs, 134 AMX-30Ds and 48 engineer vehicles (AMX-30EBG). The last 35 new battle tanks were in 1989 ordered by Cyprus and the last new variant vehicles, a batch of twenty GCTs, in 1994 by France.|$|E
25|$|His {{parents were}} Jacques Ambert and Marianne Rouchon. In 1780 he shipped as a {{volunteer}} aboard the <b>Pluton</b> (74) during the American Revolutionary War. During that conflict he participated in the Battle of Martinique during the attempted recapture of Saint Lucia in 1780 and in the successful Invasion of Tobago in May and June 1781. The <b>Pluton</b> was also engaged at the Battle of the Chesapeake on 5 September 1781. Later, the ship was part of Admiral Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil's squadron which fought at the Battle of the Saintes in April 1782. The <b>Pluton</b> survived that defeat because it called at Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 10 October 1782. Ambert returned to France in 1783.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Origin== The Pikes Peak granite was emplaced {{in three}} major {{intrusive}} {{events in the}} southern Front Range, now exposed in Colorado's Lost Creek Wilderness, Buffalo Peaks Wilderness, and Pikes Peak. It is the geochemically potassic series of <b>plutons</b> compromising most of the Pikes Peak batholith, a batholith formed of two major types of <b>plutons,</b> the potassic Pikes Peak granite and later <b>plutons,</b> plus late stage sodic syenite and granite <b>plutons.</b> Both the batholith and the Pikes Peak granite are A-type, meaning granites that originate in anorogenic, or non mountain building, tectonic settings, with an alkaline geochemistry and arising from more anhydrous magmas.|$|R
5000|$|The Colangüil Batholith is a {{group of}} <b>plutons</b> in western Argentina between the latitudes of 29 and 31° S. The <b>plutons</b> of the {{batholith}} were emplaced and cooled in the Late Paleozoic and the Triassic. Runs in a north-south direction. The <b>plutons</b> of the batholith are intruded into volcanic rocks produced by the same <b>plutons</b> plus some earlier deformed basement. The most common rocks in the batholith are granodiorite, granite and leucogranite. The batholith contains also a dyke swarm of north-south trending dykes. Compared to other subduction-related batholiths around the Pacific Ocean Colangüil Batholith is more felsic.|$|R
40|$|Whether {{granitic}} magmas can detach and digest {{fragments of}} wallrock or mingle with other magmas depends {{in large part}} on the style of magma emplacement. Many composite <b>plutons</b> grow by relatively small pulses of magma, some of which may reach their solidus before injection of the next pulse. Composite “nested ” <b>plutons</b> may grow as new pulses of magma invade and displace their predecessors, or “sheeted ” <b>plutons</b> may grow as new magma follows contacts between wallrock and older intrusions. Contrary to a common assumption, the innermost parts of a composite intrusion are not necessarily the last to be emplaced or the most fractionated. Emplacement kinematics of some <b>plutons</b> and lava domes are similar. Lava domes grow in two ways. Endogenous domes infl ate as new lava ascends and ponds within a cooler lava crust, and exogenous domes accrete as new lava ascends, breaches the lava crust, and spreads over the exterior. Exogenous growth of sheeted <b>plutons</b> offers less opportunity for magma mingling and mixing, but allows more wallrock assimilation (contamination) than endogenous growth of nested <b>plutons...</b>|$|R

25|$|On {{the basis}} of {{proportions}} of alkali feldspar to total feldspar, granites on Penang Island are further distinguished into two main groups: the North Penang <b>Pluton</b> (approximately north of latitude 5° 23'), and the South Penang <b>Pluton.</b> The former group is subdivided into the Ferringhi Granite, the Tanjung Bungah Granite and the Muka Head Microgranite, whereas the latter is subdivided into the Batu Maung Granite and the Sungai Ara Granite. A study of three disparate locations on the island show that the soil profile in Batu Ferringhi (of early Jurassic age) is silty whereas those in Paya Terubong (early Permian – late Carboniferous) and Tanjung Bungah (early Jurassic) are clayey.|$|E
25|$|There are two known {{processes}} by which magma changes: by volcanic eruption (to become lava), or by crystallization within the crust or mantle to form a <b>pluton.</b> In both cases most of the magma eventually cools and forms igneous rocks.|$|E
25|$|In the Cretaceous, a {{subduction}} zone formed {{at the edge}} of the continent. This means that an oceanic plate started to dive beneath the North American plate. Magma formed through the subduction of the ancient Farallon Plate rose in plumes (<b>plutons)</b> deep underground, their combined mass forming what is called the Sierra Nevada batholith. These <b>plutons</b> formed at various times, from 115Ma to 87Ma. The earlier <b>plutons</b> formed in the western half of the Sierra, while the later <b>plutons</b> formed in the eastern half of the Sierra. By 66Ma, the proto-Sierra Nevada had been worn down to a range of rolling low mountains, a few thousand feet high.|$|R
40|$|Voluminous Neoproterozoic {{igneous rocks}} {{along the western}} margin of the Yangtze Block, South China, provide an ideal {{opportunity}} for examining {{the nature of the}} mantle source, petrogenesis of the felsic <b>plutons</b> and processes and timing of crustal growth. The Dadukou, Tongde, Gaojiacun and Shaba mafic <b>plutons,</b> and Datian and Dajianshan adakitic <b>plutons</b> were selected for zircon Lu-Hf isotope analysis. Zircons from the mafic <b>plutons</b> have εHf(t) values ranging from 1. 86 to 11. 63, with average εHf(t) values of the different samples ranging from 4. 78 ± 0. 42 to 7. 60 ± 1. 1. Their single-stage model ages range from 0. 86 to 1. 28 Ga. The two adakitic <b>plutons</b> have εHf(t) values ranging from 2. 26 to 11. 68 and single-stage model ages from 0. 86 to 1. 24 Ga. Our data further confirm that the mafic <b>plutons</b> were extracted from depleted mantle sources, whereas the Datian and Dajianshan adakitic <b>plutons</b> were products of melting of a subducted oceanic slab. The arc-geochemical affinity, relatively high 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios and high zircon εHf(t) values, as well as the relatively young Hf single-stage model ages of these Neoproterozoic <b>plutons</b> suggest that the continental crustal growth in the region was related to oceanic subduction, rather than upwelling of a mantle plume in a rifting setting. The Neoproterozoic magmatism along the western margin of the Yangtze Block lasted more than 200 My, not show episodic emplacement and contrasting zircon Hf isotopes, suggesting that continental crustal growth in South China was continuously resulted from subduction. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract: A {{number of}} Upper Cretaceous-Palaeogene {{alkaline}} <b>plutons</b> intruded into the crustal metamorphic rocks, the pre-Maastrichtian ophiolitic mélange, and the Cretaceous-Lower Tertiary units {{are located in}} the Central Anatolia (CA), Turkey. These alkaline <b>plutons</b> constitute an important association in the post-collisional Central Anatolian Granitoids. The Dumluca, Murmana, Karakeban, Kösedağ, Hasançelebi, Karaçayır and Davulalan <b>plutons</b> constitute the eastern; whereas the Eğrialan, Baranadağ, Hamit, Çamsarı, Durmuşlu and Bayındır units the western part of this alkaline association. These <b>plutons</b> are mainly composed of silica oversaturated syenitic to monzonitic, and undersaturated syenitic felsic rocks. However, the Dumluca, Murmana and Karakeban <b>plutons</b> also include some undersaturated alkaline mafic rocks which are derived from a different mafic magma source rather than being the early fractionation derivatives of the felsic rocks in these <b>plutons.</b> There are some diversification or subdivisions on the basis of mineralogical-chemical characteristics, wall-rock, silica saturation and associated ore deposit/mineralization in these alkaline <b>plutons.</b> The diversification is thought to be sourced from either some solidification processes which modify the primary composition of any mantle-derived magma, or some different alkaline magma pulses generated by the partial melting of mantle material with different types and degrees of partial melting processes in water-starved environment. The latter consideration seems to be more reasonable due particularly to LIL and F enrichments in these rocks. They apparently indicate "late orogenic ", "within plate granite (WPG) " and "post-collisional " characteristics {{on the basis of their}} major and trace element geochemistry.
