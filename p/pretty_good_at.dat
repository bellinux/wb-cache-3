Jagannathan ends up being the chief political adviser for a struggling candidate John Kory (Sean James Sutton) in the California governor's election campaign and his use of tactics standard in Indian politics to win the election.|$|E
25|$|Then in November 1995, {{while playing}} in the L.A. band Mad Reign, Starr {{was hit by a}} drunk driver, while driving Mad Reign's Rob Thrall's {{motorcycle}} down Sunset Strip. Starr suffered a severe head injury which left him in a coma. Dave Lizmi carried on with the band as the sole remaining original member, releasing Gettin' <b>Pretty</b> <b>Good...</b> <b>at</b> Barely Gettin' By in 1996 on the Magnetic Air label, and embarking on a tour with vocalist Ron Young, formerly of Little Caesar, replacing Starr. Though it was initially hoped that Starr would recover, he eventually died on June 18, 1999. Following Starr's death, the band broke up.|$|E

Series writer Sera Gamble had been suggesting a dream-based episode since the show's first season, {{but it was not until}} the third season that the writers found the concept feasible. Although Cathryn Humphris was selected to pen [...] "Dream a Little Dream of Me" [...] due to her position on the writers' rotation, she was teamed with Gamble to develop the story. On this pairing, Humphris commented, [...] "I think that we complement each other well.

500|$|Originally, {{the game}} was {{referred}} to as [...] "F-Zero on water" [...] and would feature high-speed boats, as shown in footage from the 1995 Nintendo Shoshinkai show. These boats were expected to have transforming capabilities, allowing players to switch from a stable catamaran-style form to a more streamlined canoe-style version. However, the boats were ultimately replaced with Jet Skis. According to Miyamoto, [...] "Boats looked <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> the show, but I didn't think that Wave Race 64 would be unique from similar games on other systems if we used boats. Jet Skis can show many maneuvers that work well in the realistic water of Wave Race 64." [...] The use of Jet Skis was suggested by Rare's Tim Stamper. The game uses the Nintendo 64's alpha blending feature to make the water simultaneously transparent and reflective.|$|E

Nancy Basile of About.com listed {{it as one}} of the episodes she felt [...] "shined in season eleven". While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on [...] "Bart to the Future", writing: [...] "This kind of fantasy episode can be hit or miss, and that trend holds true here. However, more of 'Future' succeeds than flops. Though a few gags bomb, most of them prove <b>pretty</b> <b>good.</b> <b>At</b> no point does this become a classic, but it amuses much of the time." [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club wrote in 2011 that the episode [...] "was not so good, although better than many of the real stinkers yet to come at that point. Still, it utterly failed to rise to the challenge of 'Lisa’s Wedding.'" ...|$|E

[...] Jack Foley of IndieLondon rated it 2.5 out of five. Foley felt the death of Porter in the first episode was [...] "striking" [...] since Armitage was the [...] "main reason for watching." [...] The reviewer also {{believed that}} while the first series [...] "offered a keen mix of Spooks and 24 that expertly blended top-drawer action with some emotional complexity and intrigue," [...] the second series [...] "already feels inferior to both by virtue of the fact that its brains appear to lie in its pants, or blown from Porter's head."

500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2012–13 season, Gannon signed defenders Sean Newton and James Tunnicliffe, and took back Paul Turnbull on loan once again. However, he was disappointed to lose striker Tom Elliott, who rejected a contract offer to switch to Cambridge United. He also appointed long-time associate Alan Lord as his assistant. However County found themselves struggling in the league, and Gannon blamed the predicament on the board's decision to slash the wage budget in the summer. An angry Lord Snape told the press that [...] "I'm getting pretty fed up of watching part-time teams beat Stockport County. Changes {{are going to be}} made unless things improve. Jim Gannon's <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> telling me how this club should be run. Well I'm going to tell him that I'm not impressed by the way the team is being run. If we lose a couple of our next games, we're in a relegation battle with a much bigger budget than most of the teams down there with us, which quite frankly is not good enough." [...] Fourteen months into his second spell at Edgeley Park and with County sitting in the relegation zone, Gannon was relieved of his duties as Stockport manager on 16 January 2013 following the 3–1 home defeat by Mansfield Town.|$|E

[...] According to Powell: It was only once I was in college, about six months into college when I found something that I liked, and that was ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps in the military. And I not only liked it, but I was <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> it. That's what you really have to look for in life, something that you like, and something that you think you're <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>at.</b> And if you can put those two things together, then you're on the right track, and just drive on. Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, the ROTC fraternal organization and drill team begun by General John Pershing. Even after he had become a general, Powell kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition.|$|E

2500|$|After graduating {{high school}} in 2008, she {{attended}} California State Polytechnic University, Pomona where she intended to major in graphic design. During her freshman year, she looked up some online forums regarding voice-over and attended Anime Expo, where she learned about and attended an Adventures in Voice Acting workshop conducted by Tony Oliver. On Oliver's suggestion that she was <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> it, she changed her major to theatre, [...] and continued to take voice acting lessons and workshops while studying at school. She also did a production internship at Bang Zoom! Entertainment where she got to sit in {{on some of the}} recording sessions. Her first voice acting project was on K-On! where she voiced some incidental characters. Her first big voice-over role was for Battleship, based on the movie of the same name, where she got to voice a main character among many veteran voice actors. However, video game reviewers panned the game because none of the movie's actors reprised their roles in the game, and faulted the game's limited acting, which was relegated to mostly radio chatter and mission updates. At one point in college, she had some health issues that led her to take an absence from school and acting, so she pursued production work, which her parents thought would make for a more practical career; she later dropped it as she was encouraged by Oliver to pursue acting and to finish school. That was when she landed the lead role as Ayesha in the video game [...] She described Ayesha as a bit airheaded and ditsy but relatable and resembles her personality at times. [...] Video game reviewer Sean Madson of Diehardgamefan found the dub to be of decent quality, but said Ayesha [...] "sounded a bit too obnoxious with her airheadedness." [...] Matt Sainsbury of Digitally Downloaded thought the dub was reasonable but disliked their American accents as not suiting the Japanese personality of the game. [...] Vince Ingenito of IGN wrote that [...] "both the writing and voice acting fail to lend any weight to her plight. Ayesha seems about as upset over her missing sister as I might be over a glass of spilled milk, making it really hard to care about the outcome of her quest." [...] Harlacher also voiced Sadira, a spider-themed woman and new character to the Killer Instinct series.|$|E
