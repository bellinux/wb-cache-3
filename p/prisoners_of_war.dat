Gradually, more prisoners were released, but 67,000 Belgian soldiers were still in captivity by 1945. Many <b>prisoners</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> were forced to work in quarries or in agriculture and around 2,000 died in captivity.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the 20th Battalion and its successor, the 20th Armoured Regiment, lost 366 {{officers}} and men either {{killed in action}} or who later died of their wounds, including 30 men who died as <b>prisoners</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> Nearly 750 personnel were made <b>prisoners</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most French <b>prisoners</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> {{were not}} held in camps {{for most of}} the war, but instead, over 93 percent of French <b>prisoners</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> lived and worked on Kommandos of work details. Under the terms of the Geneva Convention NCOs were, like officers, {{exempted}} from work during captivity, but Germans often forced them to work. Workers were fed but virtually their entire wages were paid directly to the German army and prisoners were only allowed to retain 70 pfennigs per day.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{but later}} rumours {{included}} that {{during her first}} voyage, Centaur had transported soldiers to New Guinea, or Japanese <b>prisoners</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> back to Australia for interrogation, and consequently had been marked as a legitimate target by the Japanese.

5|$|The {{continued}} imprisonment of French soldiers was a {{major theme}} in the Vichy propaganda. <b>Prisoners</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> featured in the programme of moral rejuvenation promised {{as part of the}} Révolution nationale (National Revolution). A recurring idea was the idea of <b>prisoners</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> as martyrs or penitents, suffering in order to redeem France from its pre-war excesses. The period of detainment was therefore depicted as a form of purification which would overcome internal divides within France and atone for the defeat of 1940.|$|E

The death toll of the march is {{difficult}} to assess as thousands of captives were able to escape from their guards (although many were killed during their escapes), {{and it is not}} known how many died in the fighting that was taking place concurrently.
