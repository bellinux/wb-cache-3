2500|$|Work resumed {{again in}} 1920, {{with a start}} made on the Kawatiri tunnel using crews based at a new {{construction}} camp at Woodhen Bend. Local enthusiasm did not translate into significant official support, with only 30 men beginning work on the tunnel and access bridges, and only primitive tools and methods available to start the work. [...] The headings had to be driven for [...] before a compressor and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drill</b> were provided. [...] The [...] tunnel was finished in 1923, coinciding with the promised arrival of new construction crews fresh from working on the Otira tunnel.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{difficulties}} with sampling, {{the band and}} production team eventually became comfortable with it, even sampling Mullen's drumming, the Edge's guitar riffs, Clayton's bass lines, and Bono's vocalisations. Howie B sampled almost anything he could {{in order to find}} interesting sounds. He created sequenced patterns of the Edge's guitar playing, which the guitarist, having never done it before, found very interesting. Howie B explained, [...] "Sometimes I would sample, say, a guitar, but it wouldn't come back sounding like a guitar; it might sound more like a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drill,</b> because I would take the raw sound and filter it, really destroy the guitar sound, and rebuild it into something completely different." [...] Although sequencing was used, mostly on keyboards, guitar loops, and some percussion, it was used sparingly out of fear of becoming overreliant on it.|$|E

2500|$|Ötzi {{was found}} on 19 September 1991 by two German tourists, at an {{elevation}} of [...] on the east ridge of the Fineilspitze in the Ötztal Alps on the Austrian–Italian border. The tourists, Helmut and Erika Simon, were walking off the path between the mountain passes Hauslabjoch and Tisenjoch. They believed that the body was of a recently deceased mountaineer. The next day, a mountain gendarme and {{the keeper of the}} nearby Similaunhütte first attempted to remove the body, which was frozen in ice below the torso, using a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drill</b> and ice-axes, but had to give up due to bad weather. The next day, eight groups visited the site, among whom happened to be the famous mountaineers Hans Kammerlander and Reinhold Messner. The body was semi-officially extracted on 22 September and officially salvaged the following day. It was transported {{to the office of the}} medical examiner in Innsbruck, together with other objects found. On 24 September the find was examined there by archaeologist Konrad Spindler of the University of Innsbruck. He dated the find to be [...] "about four thousand years old", based on the typology of an axe among the retrieved objects.|$|E
60|$|When {{he came on}} deck {{next morning}} they were close to land. He looked at it with greedy eyes. There was a thin strip of silver beach rising quickly to hills covered to the top with {{luxuriant}} vegetation. The coconut trees, thick and green, came nearly to the water's edge, and among them you saw the grass houses of the Samoans; and here and there, gleaming white, a little church. Mrs Davidson came and stood beside him. She was dressed in black and wore round her neck a gold chain, from which dangled a small cross. She was a little woman, with brown, dull hair very elaborately arranged, and she had prominent blue eyes behind invisible pince-nez. Her face was long, like a sheep's, but she gave no impression of foolishness, rather of extreme alertness; she had the quick movements of a bird. The most remarkable thing about her was her voice, high, metallic, and without inflection; it fell on the ear with a hard monotony, irritating to the nerves like the pitiless clamour of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drill.</b>|$|E

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the acute honey bee poisoning events observed in several European countries during maize drilling, the dust drift topic has received increasingly more attention. We aimed to quantify the dust drift risk, develop reduction measures and innovate sowing techniques using an integrated experimental and modelling approach. To validate and finetune the dust drift CFD-models under development, the designs of three selected sowing machines and associated tractors were digitised. For the two <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drills,</b> the airflows around the machines and at the in- and outlet air ducts were measured. Air velocities at the outlets ranged from only 0. 11 m s- 1 for the <b>pneumatic</b> bulk <b>drill</b> up to 26. 1 m s- 1 for the <b>pneumatic</b> precision <b>drill</b> without deflector. The use of a deflector reduced the exit velocities to 13. 4 m s- 1 as well as the air velocities around the machine. Reference tracer seeds were developed with different qualities regarding dust production in order to measure the dissipation of dust around static operated drills and in field conditions. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The construction, {{directed}} by Germain Sommeiller, {{was scheduled to}} take 25 years, but was completed in only 14 years thanks to technical innovations such as <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drilling</b> machines and electrical ignition of explosive charges. In the final construction years, the use of recently invented dynamite further accelerated the tunnel's completion. The next two Alpine tunnels were built with similar techniques: the Gotthard Rail Tunnel opened in 1882 and the Simplon Tunnel in 1906.|$|R

5000|$|Pneumatic drills were {{developed}} {{in response to the}} needs of mining, quarrying, excavating, and tunneling. In 1806 Samuel Miller invented a steam driven percussion drill. In 1838 Isaac Singer invented another steam driven drill. A <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drill</b> was proposed by a C. Brunton in 1844. [...] The first [...] "percussion drill" [...] was made in 1848 and patented in 1849 by Jonathan J. Couch of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. [...] In this drill, the drill bit passed through the piston of a steam engine. The piston snagged the drill bit and hurled it against the rock face. It was an experimental model. In 1849, Couch's assistant, Joseph W. Fowle, filed a patent caveat for a percussion drill of his own design. In Fowle’s drill, the drill bit was connected directly to the piston in the steam cylinder; specifically, the drill bit was connected to the piston’s crosshead. The drill also had a mechanism for turning the drill bit around its axis between strokes and for advancing the drill as the hole deepened. [...] By 1850 or 1851, Fowle was using compressed air to drive his drill, making it the first true <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drill.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{jackhammer}} (<b>pneumatic</b> <b>drill</b> or {{demolition hammer}} in British English) is a pneumatic or electro-mechanical tool that combines a hammer directly with a chisel. It {{was invented by}} William Mcreavy, who then sold the patent to Charles Brady King. Hand-held jackhammers are generally powered by compressed air, but some are also powered by electric motors. Larger jackhammers, such as rig mounted hammers used on construction machinery, are usually hydraulically powered. They are typically used to break up rock, pavement, and concrete.|$|E

The rail terminal, 90 metres below the surface, is {{the start of}} a 650-metre circuit through tunnels three metres high and from three to five metres wide. Many of the tools are of considerable historical value. The collection includes rare old boring hammers and drilling machines as well as more modern <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drills.</b> The complex array of tunnels also gives an impressive picture of the mine workings.|$|R
50|$|The eastern {{entrance}} of the Hoosac Tunnel {{is located on the}} river in the town of Florida, Massachusetts. It is a railroad tunnel, still in use, started in 1851 and completed in 1875. The Burleigh Rock Drill, one of the first <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drills,</b> was used in its construction. Construction also featured the first large-scale commercial use of nitroglycerine and electric blasting caps. The American Society of Civil Engineers made the tunnel a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1975.|$|R
50|$|The tunnel {{provided}} drainage and ventilation for {{the mines}} {{as well as}} gravity-assisted ore removal. However, {{by the time the}} tunnel reached the Comstock area mines, most of the ore above 1650 ft had already been removed and the lower workings were 1500 ft deeper still. Although virtually no ore was removed through the tunnel, the drainage it provided greatly decreased the operating costs of the mines served. The ventilation problems were solved {{at about the same time}} by compressed air for the use of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drills.</b>|$|R
