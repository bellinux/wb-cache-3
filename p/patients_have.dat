5|$|As of August 15, VA {{data showed}} {{that the number of}} {{veterans}} who were waiting more than three months for an appointment has declined by half since Spring 2014, but the number who wait at least 30 days remains similar. Reported wait times for repeat <b>patients</b> <b>have</b> increased from 3.5 days to nearly 6 days. The VA paid for nearly 200,000 veterans to see private doctors, and average wait time to see a primary care doctor decreased from 51 to 43 days.|$|E
5|$|Many SCI <b>patients</b> <b>have</b> {{received}} misinformation {{about the}} effects of their injury on their sexual function and benefit from education about it. Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to be helpful and desired, it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings; a common complaint from those who go through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality. Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important, yet sexuality {{is one of the most}} often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women. Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it. Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since people may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject. Many patients wait for providers to broach the topic even if they do want the information.|$|E
5|$|The exosome {{complex is}} the target of autoantibodies in {{patients}} suffering from various autoimmune diseases. These autoantibodies are mainly found in people that suffer from the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, an autoimmune disease in which <b>patients</b> <b>have</b> symptoms from both scleroderma and either polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Autoantibodies can be detected in the serum of patients {{by a variety of}} assays. In the past, the most commonly used methods were double immunodiffusion using calf thymus extracts, immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells or immunoprecipitation from human cell extracts. In immunoprecipitation assays with sera from anti-exosome positive sera, a distinctive set of proteins is precipitated. Already years before the exosome complex was identified, this pattern was termed the PM/Scl complex. Immunofluorescence using sera from these patients usually shows a typical staining of the nucleolus of cells, which sparked the suggestion that the antigen recognized by autoantibodies might be important in ribosome synthesis. More recently, recombinant exosome proteins have become available and these have been used to develop line immunoassays (LIAs) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detecting these antibodies.|$|E

Fifteen <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> wrist pain after trauma, of which six <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> a contusion, seven <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> a fracture, one <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> a supination {{trauma of the}} wrist, and one <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> a distortion trauma. All patients received planar radiographs (before SPECT/CT) as well as early-phase and late-phase planar bone scan of the wrist/hands and SPECT/CT (all combined within one procedure, named as SPECT/CT {{for the rest of}} the manuscript). Twenty-two <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> an additional MRI prior to SPECT/CT. Five <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> a CT-only examination prior to SPECT/CT. The mean time interval between the trauma or the first onset of chronic clinical symptoms and SPECT/CT was 14 months (range 1 to 49 months). Five <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> an interval of > 24 months because the treating physician ordered serial MRI examinations prior to SPECT/CT imaging. However, all <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> chronic, clinically relevant symptoms at the time point of imaging, and conservative therapy failed to alleviate the symptoms. All patients gave written informed consent prior to the examination. Based on the retrospective nature of this study, IRB was waived.|$|R
40|$|Acute life {{threatening}} presentations of thyroid disease are uncommon. The {{aim of this}} study was to review our experience of emergency thyroid surgery with regard to the incidence, management and outcome to this approach. Methods: Forty patients who underwent emergency thyroid surgery from December 1998 to December 2007 were prospectively accrued in this study. There were 30 female and 10 male patients. The mean age was 63. 8 years (range, 33 – 83 years). All <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> total thyroidectomy, except one <b>patient</b> who only <b>had</b> a right hemithyroidectomy for a dominant right multinodular goiter. Eight of the <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> been intubated before referring to our centre. Results: The mean weight of specimen was 219 g (range, 32 – 800 g). A histopathology report confirmed 16 <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> multinodular goiters, eight <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> papillary thyroid carcinomas, seven <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> anaplastic cancers, four <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> follicular thyroid carcinomas, two <b>patients</b> <b>had</b> thyroid lymphoma, one <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> medullary carcinoma, one <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> sarcoma and one <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> thyroid abscess. A total of 28 patients were discharged well postoperatively. Conclusion: Acute {{life threatening}} presentations of thyroid disease are uncommon. However, early recognition of these problems is crucial and may life saving. Emergency thyroidectomy is important to release the critically obstructed airways. Nonetheless it is associated with higher risk of surgery and complication rate then any elective thyroid surgery...|$|R
