40|$|Abstract- More than 8 {{thousands}} LHC magnets {{of various}} types will be extensively measured during series magnetic test at both room and superfluid helium temperature.

The most efficient and cost effective method with rotating <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>coil</b> is chosen currently as a baseline for series measurement. The position of the measuring coil axis herewith is measured with a dedicated optical system. The deflection of the light beam in the air due to temperature gradient either passing through the cold bore when the magnet excited for warm measurement or through the anti-cryostat during cold measurement can reach magnitudes significantly exceeding tolerance and therefore is a critical issue. We present studies of the light deflection in 10 m long dipole at warm and cold and propose means to reduce it.

When a temperature rise has been produced locally in the Bi- 2223 solenoidal coil, Poynting 2 ̆ 7 s vectors around the coil and the temperature of windings were measured.

Compared to conventional wire-wound pick-up coil based eddy current NDI methods, Giant Magneto-resistive (GMR) sensor based eddy current methods have shown a much better sensitivity (20 – 50 times) for a given driving current and frequency. In addition to the higher sensitivity of the GMR sensors, {{it has been shown}} that the interpretation of GMR sensor detected signals is much less complicated than the conventional eddy current signals that are normally displayed on an impedance plane.

40|$|An {{important}} effect {{observed in}} ILW discharges {{is the change}} of q = 1 MHD activity in hybrid discharges. The q = 1 activity with the JET C-wall had usually shown no effect on plasma confinement, except for NTM triggering, its main experimental signature being a rotating kink activity interleaving sawteeth crashes. In the C-Wall hybrid scenario sawteeth had low amplitude and frequency, and the rotating precursor had often fishbone characteristic. The radial profile of the mode fluctuation has been calculated using a coherence technique between one <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>coil</b> and 96 ECE measurements along the red L. o. S in Figure 1. As explained in ref. [1], the coherence phase radial profile shows a -jump whenever an island is crossed moving along the plasma radius, this effect {{is due to the}} radial displacement of magnetic field lines produced by the rotating island, which has opposite directions on the outer side of the island x-point than on the inner side of the x-point. In the C-Wall hybrid pulses the ECE fluctuation at the q = 1 magnetic frequency did not show any radial phase jump, {{as can be seen in}} Figure 2, and therefore had kink characteristic...|$|E

Presently, {{the growth of}} resistive MHD modes (n= 1 /m= 3 or n= 1 /m= 2) as the edge q[q(a) ] is lowered toward 3. 5 appears to limit the maximum current achievable in CDX-U. For low q(a) discharges, a prominent rotating hot spot can be seen with the soft x-ray array, indicative of a magnetic isl{{and associated}} with a n= 1 /m= 1 mode. The edge mode, which is n= 1 /m= 3 or n= 1 /m= 2, {{can be seen by}} the soft x-ray and edge magnetic <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>coil</b> array. The growth of those modes in space and amplitude eventually leads to an Internal Reconnection Event (IRE). Prior to the IRE, strong mode-mixing takes place suggesting magnetic island overlap. The IRE causes a rapid heat loss from the core causing a strong plasma elongation and current spike due to the plasma inductance drop. With an appropriate discharge control, a MHD quiescent high confinement regime with over twice the central electron temperature relative to the MHD active regime has been found. To assess the halo-induced effects during the MHD events, a pair of segmented Rogowski coils were installed on the center stack.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} of MHD activity in type-I ELMy H-mode discharges on JET have revealed two phenomena: (i) the so-called palm tree mode, a new, snake-like MHD mode at the q= 3 surface which is excited by type-I ELMs, and (ii) coherent MHD mode activity as {{a precursor to}} the ELM collapse. Both modes are detected by magnetic <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>coils</b> and {{can also be seen}} on the edge ECE and SXR measurements. They are located a few cm inside the separatrix. Palm tree modes have been identified {{in a wide range of}} plasma conditions, which comprise standard ELMy H-modes, ITER-like plasma shapes, pellet fuelling, and even pure helium plasmas. The mode frequency increases in time and starts to saturate until the mode finally decays. A likely explanation of the palm tree mode is, that it is the remnant of an (3, 1) -island created due to edge ergodisation by the ELM perturbation. Refined methods of data evaluation allowed to identified low frequency coherent type-I ELM precursor modes with toroidal mode numbers in the range 2 to 14. They seem to have a kink-like structure, and appear normally 0. 5 - 1 ms before the ELM, but in many cases even much earlier...|$|R

The critical currents {{for the two}} VAC samples were measured {{as a function of}} magnetic field strength. The critical current of each sample was well described by the generalized Kim model. The critical current was also measured as a function of angle of the magnetic field with respect to the plane of the tapes, in all cases perpendicular to the transport current flow. Both samples displayed a high sensitivity to the magnetic field orientation with the largest critical currents measured when the magnetic field was in-plane with the broad face of the tapes. The current ramp rate effect on the critical current was investigated and showed no significant effect on the critical current measurements for ramp speeds between 6 A/min and 120 A/min. The energy dissipation or AC losses as a function of peak AC magnetic field, magnetic field sweep frequency, and transport current for a VAC sample and a sample manufactured by IGC - Advanced Superconductors (IGC) were measured at 77 K. The losses were measured using a <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>coil</b> with a lock-in amplifier to measure the magnetization of the superconducting samples. The AC losses of both samples displayed complete electromagnetic coupling of the superconducting filaments at magnetic sweep frequencies of approximately 0. 1 Hz.

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to apply extra large scale superconducting magnets for a fusion device like Large Helical Device (LHD). Because of the relatively larger current (10 kA or more), new evaluation method to determine the fundamental characteristics of superconductors have to be developed, which are already established for thin superconducting wires. In this paper, a measuring method of critical current, stability margin, current distribution are mainly discussed. Bath-cooled composite type and supercritical helium force-cooled type NbTi conductors have been chosen for helical coils and poloidal coils of LHD, respectively. A critical current of a conductor was measured as follows. Two 2 m long parallel conductors, which were connected {{each other at the}} bottom, were inserted in a 9 T split coil. The surface of the conductor was covered 50 % by spacers to simulate heat transfer conditions.

40|$|MHD modes always {{occur in}} ASDEX Upgrade before q-limit and density limit disruptions. The {{modulation}} of the poloidal field due to rotating islands {{is measured by}} a poloidal array of 30 <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>coils</b> and by 4 coils in a toroidal plane. For {{a detailed analysis of}} the modes the Mirnov probe measurements are compared with simulations of the perturbative field at the probe locations. In the simulation the current flows along field lines on the resonant flux surface and the current density is proportional to the magnetic field. The location of the resonant surface and the current density are computed from the equilibrium analysis of the discharge. The induced eddy currents in vacuum vessel and in conducting structures close to the Mirnov probe are taken into account while computing the perturbative field. By increasing the plasma current in a circular limiter discharge, a (m= 3, n= 1) kink mode is destablized when the q= 3 surface comes close to the edge. Simulations done assuming a perturbative current on this surface show good agreement with the measurements. In elongated single null plasmas a dominant (m= 2, n= 1) mode always occurs before disruptions. In this case the simulated amplitude of the modulation is in disagreement with the measurements. The measured and simulated ratio between the amplitude on the high field side and the low field side differs by a factor of two. This ratio is not constant as the modes develops. Especially in a density limit discharge with high q_ 9 _ 5 = 5 at the edge, the amplitude of the perturbative field increases by a factor of 10 in few ten milliseconds before the first minor disruption. In this short time interval the equilibrium of the plasma does not change, but the ratio between the inside and the outside amplitude decreases. In order to correct the ratio of the amplitudes on neighboring resonant surfaces, additional modes are considered. With the assumption of constructive mode coupling on the low field side, it is possible to correct the discrepancy in the ratio of the amplitudes and to get a good agreement in the modulation phase. During the strong increase before the first minor disruption the (m= 3, n= 1) mode grows quicker than the dominant (m= 2, n= 1) mode. By superposing the computed perturbative flux on the helical equilibrium flux, the structure of the islands on the resonant surfaces becomes clear. This analysis confirms that the minor disruptions start when the growing islands on the different surfaces come close together. Inside the q= 2 surface the plasma is not yet disturbed. because of the mode locking before the major disruption such an exact analysis of the measurements is not possible for the major disruption.

40|$|Abstract—Biosensors are a {{predominant}} research {{field and}} aim at providing small and novel methods for bio-recognition, bio-actuation and embedded data analysis {{to the medical}} and bioengineering domains. Typical biosensor technologies exploit optical, electrochemical or mechanical detection methods. Although many biosensors are designed to use biological samples for recognition and treatment, some {{are designed to be}} implantable on animals or human for direct detection. The presented work suggests the use of a magnetoelastic based biosensor for the wireless transmission of physiological data through the human body at capillary level. When excited by an external magnetic wave at a given frequency, the magnetoelastic core enters in a vibrating state and emits an alternative magnetic field in response. Using an external RF coils such as the one found in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system, the magnetic flux generated by the magnetoelastic sensor core is received and analyzed during its transient response.

40|$|In the {{measurement}} of mutual inductance, {{it was found that}} the measured output of the coil could not be balanced by any constant external voltage, but that the output was modulated with an unsteady signal of an approximate 2 -sec period. This modulation was traced to a crossmodulation in the selective amplifier between the 300 -cycle har-monic of the line frequency and the 267 2 / 3 - and 333 1 / 3 -cycle harmonics of our oscil-lator frequency, all of which were <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by the <b>coils</b> in the circuit. Since the line frequency varied somewhat from 60 cycles, the resulting signal varied somewhat from 33 cycles. The beats measured were then those between this signal and the signal which it was actually desired to measure. A rejection filter centered on 300 cycles placed at the input of the selective amplifier cured this trouble. It is now possible to detect signals of less than 0. 1 pv. Both the noise pickup and the drift are, however, of the order of a few tenths of a microvolt or the equivalent of approximately 1 percent of the change in mutual inductance between 4 °K and 1. 3 °K.
