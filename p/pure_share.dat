However, in my knowledge, none of them examines how these payments affect on the economic performance of fisheries. This study is an empirical study analyses the impact of remuneration system on the fisheries economic performance. The overall objective in this study is to analyze how important of remuneration system on the economic performance of fisheries in Vietnam. The case of the purse seine fishery in Khanh Hoa province will be used for estimation. This question has also arisen in a context of a comparison of the efficiency of two types of remuneration system- the <b>pure</b> <b>share</b> payment and the fixed wage plus share payment which are typical of the small scale fisheries in the South Central of Vietnam. Of additional interest is to determine which factors influence on payment contracts of small scale purse seine fishery in Khanh Hoa, Vietnam. On the other hand, this study will try to relate fishermens behaviour of choosing remuneration system to social, economic and demographic variables. These implications are useful information for decision makers and fishermen in adjustment of their behaviour toward to efficiency gains...|$|E

The proposed solution uses compiler analysis to extract data access patterns of parallel processors and employs integer linear programming for determining optimal on-chip memory partitioning across processors and data allocations across the resulting memory components. Our experimental results show that the applicationspecific on-chip memory hierarchies designed using this approach are much more energy efficient than conventional (<b>pure</b> <b>shared</b> or <b>pure</b> private) on-chip memories, conventional caches, and those designed by a prior work that partitions memory space across parallel processors without designing a multi-level hierarchy. ...|$|R

40|$|International {{risk sharing}} {{is one of}} the main {{arguments}} in favor of financial liberalization. The <b>pure</b> risk <b>sharing</b> mechanism highlighted by Obstfeld (1994) implies that liberalization is growth enhancing for all countries as it allows the world portfolio to shift from safe low-yield capital to riskier high yield capital. This result is obtained under the assumption that the volatility figures for risky assets prevailing under autarky are not altered after liberalization. This note relaxes this assumption within the standard two-country model with intertemporal portfolio choices, formally incorporating the instability effect invoked by Stiglitz (2000). We show that putting together the <b>pure</b> risk <b>sharing</b> and instability effects in the latter set-up enriches the analysis and delivers predictions more consistent with the contrasted related empirical literature...|$|R

40|$|Parallel systems {{supporting}} a shared memory programming interface {{have been implemented}} both in software and hardware. Hardware shared memory systems are fast, but generally expensive. Software shared memory systems are cheaper but slower. A clustered software shared memory system on a network of symmetric multiprocessors (SMP) is a hybrid solution to implementing shared memory with good performance at a reasonable cost. Within one SMP node, the hardware supports fine grained cache-coherence without any software intervention. Across nodes, a shared memory abstraction is implemented in software. Such systems are cheaper than <b>pure</b> hardware <b>shared</b> memory machines and more efficient than <b>pure</b> software <b>shared</b> memory systems. We built a software distributed shared memory system for clusters of SMP machines and designed a unified fork-join programming model for our system. Our model allows users {{to take advantage of}} the physically shared memory within each SMP machine while preserving a uniform interface for both inter-node and intra-node parallelization. We also developed a front-end compiler that provides a loop annotation interface to the user and automatically generates parallel programs in the unified fork-join model.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues in designing a chip multiprocessor is to decide its on-chip memory organisation. While it is possible to design an application-specific memory architecture, this may not necessarily be the best option, in particular when storage demands of individual processors and/or their data sharing patterns can change from one point in execution to another for the same application. Here, two problems are formulated. First, we show how a polyhedral method can be used to design, for array-based data-intensive embedded applications, an application-specific hybrid memory architecture that has both shared and private components. We evaluate the resulting memory configurations using a set of benchmarks and compare them to pure private and <b>pure</b> <b>shared</b> memory on-chip multiprocessor architectures. The second approach proposed consider dynamic configuration of software-managed on-chip memory space to adapt to the runtime variations in data storage demand and interprocessor sharing patterns. The proposed framework is fully implemented using an optimising compiler, a polyhedral tool, and a memory partitioner (based on integer linear programming), and is tested using a suite of eight data-intensive embedded applications. © 2010 © The Institution of Engineering and Technology...|$|R

Interestingly, local determinability of pure states is closely related to a generalized notion of Schmidt decomposition. Furthermore, we find that locally undetermined states have some applications to the well-known consensus problem in distributed computation. To be specific, given some physically separated agents, when communication between them, either classical or quantum, is unreliable and they are not allowed to use local ancillary quantum systems, then there exists a totally correct and completely fault-tolerant protocol for them to reach a consensus if and only if they share a priori a locally undetermined quantum state.

In other words, it is obtained the non–stationary distribution of the random counting measure representing the transient state of the FBPS queue in all details.
