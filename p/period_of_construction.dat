5|$|Fifteen {{buildings}} {{are open to}} the public as part of the Rancho Camulos Museum, all of which were built before 1930 and are still in their original locations. They were built mostly in Spanish Colonial or Mission Revival styles (the latter is derived from the former). Later buildings were designed in differing architectural styles, more representative of their <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction.</b> Landscaping features, such as lawns, flower gardens, ornamental trees, and walkways, separate the residential areas from the working portions of the ranch.|$|E
5|$|Installation of Transformers: The Ride at Universal Studios Hollywood, {{required}} {{the removal of}} two attractions. On Sunday, April 11, 2010, Backdraft and Special Effects Stages closed. The Special Effects Stages were relocated to the Upper Lot and renamed the Special Effects Stage on June 26, 2010. Work began almost immediately {{on the construction of}} the ride. After a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> spanning close to two years, the ride and its gift store, the Transformers Supply Vault, soft opened to the public in late April 2012. Transformers: The Ride officially opened to the public on May 24, 2012.|$|E
5|$|SMS Hansa {{was built}} in 1868–1875, the first ironclad built in Germany; all {{previous}} German ironclads had been built in foreign shipyards. This resulted in a much longer <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction,</b> however, as she was built by the relatively inexperienced Royal Dockyard in Danzig. She was named after the Hanseatic League, known in Germany simply as Hanse, Latinized Hansa. The ship was launched in October 1872 and commissioned into the Imperial Navy in May 1875. Designed for overseas service, Hansa was classed as an armored corvette and armed with eight 21cm guns in a central battery.|$|E

5|$|On 5 February 2015, Network Rail's tracklaying machine {{reached the}} end of the line at Tweedbank station where a large crowd had gathered. As there was not enough track for the train to {{complete}} tracklaying into the second platform, it had to return the next day. The formal completion took place on 12 February when Keith Brown clipped the final length of rail into place. During the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction,</b> more than 1,000 rails were laid across 90,000 sleepers. With the infrastructure complete, attention was turned to the installation of signalling and communications equipment as well as finalising the stations. A GSM-R system controlled from the IECC next to Edinburgh Waverley was in place by April 2015.|$|E
5|$|These {{utilitarian}} fortifications {{were armed}} with artillery, {{intended to be}} used against enemy ships before they could land forces or attack ships lying in harbour. The first wave of work between 1539 and 1543 was characterised {{by the use of}} circular bastions and multi-tiered defences, combined with many traditional medieval features. These designs contained serious military flaws, however, and the second <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> until 1547 saw the introduction of angular bastions and other innovations probably inspired by contemporary thinking in mainland Europe. The castles were commanded by captains appointed by the Crown, overseeing small garrisons of professional gunners and soldiers, who would be supplemented by the local militia in an emergency.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that Doune Castle was originally built in the thirteenth century, then probably damaged in the Scottish Wars of Independence, before being rebuilt in its present form in the late 14th century by Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany (c.1340–1420), the son of King Robert II of Scots, and Regent of Scotland from 1388 until his death. Duke Robert's stronghold has survived relatively unchanged and complete, and the whole castle was traditionally thought of {{as the result of a}} single <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> at this time. The castle passed to the crown in 1425, when Albany's son was executed, and was used as a royal hunting lodge and dower house. In the later 16th century, Doune became the property of the Earls of Moray. The castle saw military action during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and Glencairn's rising in the mid-17th century, and during the Jacobite Risings of the late 17th century and 18th century. By 1800 the castle was ruined, but restoration works were carried out in the 1880s, prior to its passing into state care in the 20th century. It is now maintained by Historic Scotland.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} medieval but {{seems to have}} been subject to {{additions}} over a long period. The Tower shows three separate <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction.</b> The lowest section is 13th century, the middle section is 14th century and the top is 15th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} in part {{reflects the}} various <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the building.

25|$|However, {{the dating}} to the period of Earl Richard has {{superseded}} Ralegh Radford's interpretation which attributed the earliest elements of the castle to Earl Reginald de Dunstanville and later elements to Earl Richard.

25|$|In {{some cases}} virtual {{interchanges}} in place during a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> were superseded by physical interchanges {{at the completion}} of the construction. For example, Hongkou Football Stadium Station was previously a virtual interchange between Line 3 and Line 8. Another previously virtual interchange was South Shaanxi Road Station between Line 1 and Line 10; after the opening of an extension of line 12 to the station in December 2015 transfers among all three lines became a physical interchange.|$|E
25|$|Transfer of {{the coffin}} to the tomb may {{take as long}} as several months while the {{building}} is completed. During this <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> another two-day mourning ceremony takes place; zebu sacrifice and ritual wailing may again take place upon placing the coffin in the tomb. Once the coffin has been placed, stones are heaped over it to fill the tomb. The deceased's house is then destroyed by fire to complete the funeral rites. Family and community members will not return to visit the tomb.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{movement}} of faculty and classes into the new structure, renovations were initiated on the more than 40-year-old 180,000-square-foot Jefferson Building.

25|$|Given {{the date}} {{associated}} with the sanctuary (1864), 100 years after {{the construction of the}} church, it is unclear whether this was part of the original design, or if it developed later. If it was secondary plan, it can be concluded that this design was influenced by the construction of the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus (in Braga), which was constructed between 1784-1811. Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida, has noted that interior tile {{is one of the more}} notable group of tilework this lateral <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prior to the bridge's construction, environmentalists raised {{numerous}} {{concerns and}} criticisms, chiefly about the immediate damage from construction {{work and the}} effects of long-term pollution from a projected increase in car traffic. The construction process resulted in a temporary increase in turbidity of the Severn's waters. Although eelgrass is reasonably tolerant to short-term high turbidity and consequent loss of light, the bed of eelgrass in the Severn was observed to decline considerably during the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction.</b> The construction of the approach roads and toll plaza resulted in the permanent loss of some wet pastureland.|$|E

25|$|The {{closure of}} the School for Girls in 1946 and the Boy's Academy in 1953 coincided with a period of {{expansion}} and provided much-needed space for the growing university. In 1958, a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> and acquisition of buildings began, easing the strain of overcrowding at the institution. At this time the university board and administration decided to reaffirm the traditional aims of Mount Allison in providing a high-quality undergraduate liberal arts education, along with continuing to offer professional programs in already-established fields. As such, the university decided not to compete for new professional programs and generally avoided post-graduate course development.|$|E
25|$|The fourth St Paul's, {{generally}} {{referred to}} as Old St Paul's, was begun by the Normans after the 1087 fire. A further fire in 1136 disrupted the work, and the new cathedral was not consecrated until 1240. During the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction,</b> the style of architecture had changed from Romanesque to Gothic and this {{was reflected in the}} pointed arches and larger windows of the upper parts and East End of the building. The Gothic ribbed vault was constructed, like that of York Minster, of wood rather than stone, which affected the ultimate fate of the building.|$|E
25|$|The {{temple of}} Apollo at Didyma near Miletus, begun around 540 BC, was another dipteros with open {{internal}} courtyard. The interior was structured with powerful pilasters, their rhythm reflecting {{that of the}} external peristasis. The columns, with 36 flutings, were executed as columnae caelatae with figural decoration, like those at Ephesos. Construction ceased around 500 BC, but was restarted in 331 BC and finally completed in the 2nd century BC. The enormous costs involved {{may have been one}} of the reasons for the long <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction.</b> The building was the first Ionic temple to follow the Attic tradition of uniform column distances, the frontal diffentiation was not practised any more.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 This thesis {{will explore}} the {{architectural}} material culture excavated at the Robert Newell Homestead (35 MA 41), currently located in Champoeg, Oregon. Specifically, the {{research focuses on}} the vernacular architecture or the features and construction methods used that both reflect {{the environment and the}} cultural traditions of the dwellings occupants. The Robert Newell homestead is a well preserved site that reflects the (1830 s - 1860 s) unique settlement history of Champoeg, Oregon, first settled by French Canadian fur trappers and slowly overcome by American homesteaders. As excavations took place at the site, it became clear that several <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> had occurred at the Robert Newell homestead reflecting both French Canadian and American cultural building traditions. These <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> are explored through a close examination of nails, bricks, window glass, and their frequency throughout the site as well as several well preserved architectural features. Many documents exploring cultural styles <b>of</b> <b>construction,</b> the history <b>of</b> the area and its growth, as well as the history of the homesteads occupants are also explored...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHistorical {{development}} of residential housing {{is likely to}} have had certain influence on the current market prices of apartments. It is therefore important to ensure that the influence is correctly evaluated and adjusted to eliminate other factors. The influence is identified in relation to the probable motives and preferences relating to demand. The methodology is based on the formation of a comparative database of apartments, as homogeneous as possible, across different <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> on the Czech real estate market which can be divided into specific <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> time, each having their own characteristic features. Each database corresponds with a city with distinctive differences defined. The compiled and modified database can be statistically tested using linear parametric and non-parametric models. The findings indicate existence of price differences across the individual <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction,</b> and facilitate a formulation of a functional (graphic) expression of the dependence for individual cities as well as an aggregate for the entire Czech market, i. e. a global curve. Subsequently, other possible causes, apart from the demand, are discussed...|$|R
