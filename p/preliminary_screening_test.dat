40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of sublethal doses of an organophosphorus insecticide, Methyl Parathion (MeP), on the foraging behaviour of honeybees (Apis mellifera ligustica) in a flight cage. The results revealed that MeP modified the frequency of visits to a feeding station to which the bees had previously been trained. A dose of 50 ng per animal elicited an increase in the frequency of visits to the feeder, compared to control animals. A dose of 10 ng, on the other hand, led initially to a decrease in the visit frequency, followed by an increase to a level above that of the controls. A hypothesis is presented to account for the way in which MeP affects foraging behaviour. We propose that the behavioural assay presented here could be useful as a <b>preliminary</b> <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> to study sublethal effects of pesticides on foraging performance in honeybees...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{the normal}} epidermis of mice on the first 5 days of exposure to a single application of carcinogens and cocarcinogens has been investigated by simple quantitative measurements of cell population, size of cells and thickness of the epidermis.

40|$|New rapid human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) antibody tests permit many individuals to receive test results and appropriate counseling at one clinic visit. Because currently used tests require significant time for processing, all individuals must return for a second visit for test results and counseling. Since return rates for the second visit are low, the more rapid tests present an opportunity to improve the efficiency of HIV counseling and testing. The authors compared the costs and effectiveness of the currently used counseling and testing procedure and a streamlined procedure {{made possible by the}} new, more rapid screening tests. When test-positive clients are given <b>preliminary</b> <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> results, the rapid procedure is more cost-effective than the current procedure.

However, in the case where the goal of HIV counseling and testing is to focus only on infected individuals, if information regarding a positive result from the rapid screening test is not given to clients at the initial visit before a confirmatory test is performed, then the rapid counseling and testing procedure is not more cost-effective than the current procedure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{diagnosis}} of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) relies on microscopic visualization of Pneumocystis jirovecii organisms or DNA detection in pulmonary specimens. This study aimed {{to assess the}} usefulness of (1 – 3) -β-d-glucan (BG), Krebs von den Lungen- 6 antigen (KL- 6), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) as serologic biomarkers in the {{diagnosis of}} PCP. Serum levels of BG, KL- 6, LDH and SAM were investigated in 145 Portuguese patients, 50 patients from the Netherlands, 25 Spanish patients and 40 Portuguese blood donors. Data on clinical presentation, chest imaging and gasometry tests were available. PCP cases were confirmed by microscopy and PCR techniques. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. BG {{was found to be}} the most reliable serologic biomarker for PCP diagnosis, followed by KL- 6, LDH and SAM. The BG/KL- 6 combination test was the most accurate serologic approach for PCP diagnosis, with 94. 3 % sensitivity and 89. 6 % specificity. Although less sensitive/specific than the reference standard classic methods based on bronchoalveolar lavage followed by microscopic or molecular detection of P.  jirovecii organisms, the BG/KL- 6 test may provide a less onerous procedure for PCP diagnosis, as it uses a minimally invasive and inexpensive specimen (blood), which may be also a major benefit for the patient's care. The BG/KL- 6 combination test should be interpreted within the clinical context, and it may be used as a <b>preliminary</b> <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> in patients with primary suspicion of PCP, or as an alternative diagnostic procedure in patients with respiratory failure or in children, avoiding the associated risk of complications by the use of bronchoscopy...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{chemical}} carcinogenesis testing employs a 2 -year rodent bioassay with nearly 900 animals for each chemical evaluation.

Very low power electric thrusters which provide tens to hundreds micronewtons of thrust may need field emission neutralizers {{that have a}} capability of tens to hundreds of microamperes. From current voltage characteristics, {{it was found that}} the CVD diamond and textured metals cathodes clearly satisfied the Fowler-Nordheim emission relation. The CVD diamond and a textured copper cathode had average current densities of 270 and 380 mA/sq cm, respectively, at the beginning-of-life. After a few hours of operation the cathode emission currents degraded by 40 to 75 % at background pressures in the 10 (exp - 5) Pa to 10 (exp - 4) Pa range. The textured pyrolytic graphite had a modest current density at beginning-of-life of 84 mA/sq cm, but this cathode was the most stable of all. Extended testing of the most promising cathodes is warranted to determine if current degradation is a burn-in effect or whether it is a long-term degradation process. Preliminary experiments with ferroelectric emission cathodes, which are ceramics with spontaneous electric polarization, were conducted.

In this work, the BS production yield of marine hydrocarbon degraders isolated from Elefsina bay in Eastern Mediterranean Sea has been investigated. The drop collapse {{test was used}} as a <b>preliminary</b> <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> to confirm biosurfactant producing strains or mixed consortia. The community structure of the best consortia based on the drop collapse test was determined by 16 S-rDNA pyrotag screening. Subsequently, the effect of incubation time, temperature, substrate and supplementation with inorganic nutrients, on biosurfactant production, was examined. Two types of BS - lipid mixtures were extracted from the culture broth; the low molecular weight BS Rhamnolipids and Sophorolipids. Crude extracts were purified by silica gel column chromatography and then identified by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Results indicate that biosurfactant production yield remains constant and low while it is independent of the total culture biomass, carbon source, and temperature. A constant BS concentration in a culture broth with continuous degradation of crude oil implies that the BS producing microbes generate no more than the required amount of biosurfactants that enables biodegradation of the crude oil. Isolated pure strains were found to have higher specific production yields than the complex microbial marine community-consortia. The heavy oil fraction of crude oil has emerged as a promising substrate for BS production (by marine BS producers) with fewer impurities in the final product. Furthermore, a particular strain isolated from sediments, Paracoccus marcusii, may be an optimal choice for bioremediation purposes as its biomass remains trapped in the hydrocarbon phase, not suffering from potential dilution effects by sea currents...|$|E
40|$|Many sleep centres {{employ a}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> {{in order to}} reduce the number of polysomnographies {{required}} in the routine diagnosis of the sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (SAHS). We investigated the combination of heart rate and oximetry information as a means of performing this test. A retrospective study of 100 patients with suspected SAHS was made. All patients had in-hospital polysomnography on one night. We estimated the number of respiratory event-related arousals by counting the number of autonomic arousals (assessed on the basis of changes in the heart interbeat interval) that were coincident with a rise in oximetry. The hourly index of such events was denoted the 'cardiac-oximetry disturbance index' (CODI). The median apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) was 16. 5 (range 1. 0 - 93. 6) h(- 1). The CODI correlated significantly with the AHI (Spearman correlation coefficient r (s) = 0. 88, P < 0. 01), and the area (+/- standard error) under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was 0. 94 +/- 0. 05. Oximetry alone (based on 4 % dips) was a less effective screening test (r (s) = 0. 80, P < 0. 01; area under ROC 0. 83 +/- 0. 06). Using 2 % dips in oximetry offered comparable performance with the CODI (r (s) = 0. 91, P < 0. 01; area under ROC 0. 93 +/- 0. 04). The CODI was better correlated with the electroencephalograph arousal index (r (s) = 0. 84, P < 0. 01) than was oximetry (2 % dips, r (s) = 0. 57, P < 0. 01). The CODI algorithm also offers an informal measure of self-validation: a large discrepancy between the number of autonomic arousals and the number of rises in oximetry indicates the presence of autonomic arousals without changes in oximetry (or vice versa). This self-validation mechanism identified several patients in this study, and may be useful in identifying sleep disruption due to chronic pain or other causes...|$|E
40|$|A {{deficiency}} in apoptosis {{is one of}} the key events in the proliferation and resistance of malignant cells to antitumor agents; for these reasons, the search for apoptosis-inducing drugs represents a valuable approach for the development of novel anticancer therapies 1. Within the past decade ceramide, a proapoptotic natural sphingolipid, emerged as active participants in the regulation of key biologic functions, including cell growth, differentiation, transformation, apoptosis. Resveratrol, a naturally occurring phytoalexin (3, 5, 4 -trans-trihydroxystilbene) present in medicinal plants, grape skin, peanuts, and red wine, has been reported to have chemopreventive activity, by exerting antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in human cancer cells 2. The antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties of resveratrol have been shown to be due to an accumulation of endogenous ceramide in cancer cell lines. In particular, the apoptotic cell death has been attributed more likely to the de novo synthesized ceramide 3. Nevertheless, the trihydroxylated trans-stilbene chemical structure of resveratrol may undergo, as well as most stilbene derivatives, to several chemical and metabolic degradations. One well-known transformation is represented by the photochemical (E) /(Z) -isomerization of the double bond, to produce compounds of (Z) -configuration that are generally less active to inhibit cellular growth and promote apoptosis. The main metabolic reactions on stilbene derivatives involve oxidation reactions on the double bond and on the electron-rich phenolic rings, producing highly reactive oxidized metabolites (e. g. epoxides, arene oxides, benzylic alcohols, etc.). For these reasons we initially decided to investigate the possibility of preparing resveratrol analogues possessing a more rigid and stable scaffold, by replacing the 4 -hydroxy-styrene portion with a beta-naphthol portion. We then designed and synthesized a series of naphthalene-based resveratrol analogues, which possess either “all-free” hydroxyls, or various combinations of O-methylated OH substituents, to assess the importance of the phenolic groups also in this new class of resveratrol analogues. These analogues were then tested for their ceramide-mediated proapoptotic activity, and we found that the analogue with three hydroxyls and a naphthalene ring was the most effective in triggering apoptosis coupled to the induction of endogenous ceramide in the human breast cancer cell line (IC 50 = 12. 7 ìM versus IC 50 = 20. 5 ìM of resveratrol). Based on these findings, we have then designed and synthesized a new series of resveratrol analogues by replacing the naphthol moiety with other heterocycles, in order to to increase polarity and conseguently hydrosolubility. Contemporarily we substituted the metabolically unstable stilbene double bond present in resveratrol with a more stable amido or thioamido moiety. All the new compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferative effects and ceramide accumulation in human cancer cell lines. Since, resveratrol acts as a BK channel opener, evoking a vasorelaxing effect comparable, in potency, to that of the synthetic reference drug NS 16194. Resveratrol structural analogues could hence represent a promising approach in order to develop a new class of potential BK openers. Large-conductance calcium-activated (BK) potassium channels are involved in many fundamental cell functions. Consistently, the ability to activate BK channels by exogenous compounds is considered as a promising pharmacodynamic pattern for the potential treatment of several pathologies (such as hypertension, neurodegenerative disease etc) 5, 6. On these bases the synthesised compounds were subjected to a functional evaluation of their vasorelaxing properties in in vitro assays on rat aortic rings, in the presence or in the absence of selective potassium channels blockers, as a <b>preliminary</b> <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> to point out their potential activation of potassium channels...|$|E

The study group consisted of 166 patients undergoing renal arteriography as potential renal allograft donors. Ninety-seven patients were male and 69 were female. Ages ranged from 18 - 54 years, median age being 37 years. All patients underwent <b>preliminary</b> <b>screening</b> <b>tests</b> including blood chemistries, creatinine clearance, urinalysis, culture and excretory urography. If these studies were normal, renal arteriography was performed utilizing flush aortogram and, in 20 % of cases, selective renal arteriography. The most common anomaly was the presence of multiple renal arteries supplying the same kidney, occurring in 32 % of cases. Prehilar segmental branching was the second most common variation, occurring in 17 % of patients. Other variations included fetal lobulation (4 %), significant stenosis at origin of the renal artery (2 %), fibromuscular dysplasia (2 %), microaneurysms (0. 5 %), true aneurysms (1 %) and dromedary hump (0. 5 %). Less than one-half of the patients demonstrated the simplest vascular pedicle, namely, single artery and vein bilaterally. The incidence of anatomical variations in the renal vascular pedicle is greater than attributed to normal subjects in previous reports. Anomalies determine the choice of kidney in renal allografting and may disqualify a potential donor, {{even in the face of}} ostensibly normal renal function. Routine arteriography should be considered a standard prerequisite in the evaluation of potential living related renal donors...|$|R

40|$|Seventeen fungal {{isolates}} {{were tested}} in vitro as potential antagonists of two isolates of the root rot pathogen, Armillaria mellea. Some of the isolates were also added on mushroom composts with living mycelia {{to the roots of}} Armillaria-inoculated potted strawberry plants in the glasshouse to find out if they had the same degree of efficacy against the disease. Dactylium dendroides isolate SP was the most effective in reducing mycelial growth of A. mellea isolate 1 (Am 1), followed by Trichoderma harzianum isolate Th 2 and T. viride isolate Tv 4. Th 2, Th 22, Tv 3 and SP grew extensively over Am 1 colonies, disintegrating the rhizomorphs. Isolate Tham 1 of T hamatum was the most effective in reducing mycelial growth of A. mellea isolate 2 (Am 2), followed by Tv 3. Th 12, Th 22, Tv 1, Tv 3 and SP inhibited the initiation and growth of rhizomorphs of Am 2. Regeneration tests showed that both Am 1 and Am 2 attacked by Trichoderma isolates and SP were no longer viable. Th 23 and SP were almost as effective in vivo as in vitro. But isolate Co of Chaetomium olivaceum, which was ineffective in vitro, was found effective in vivo. Conversely, Th 2, which exhibited good antagonistic activity in vitro, performed poorly in vivo. These results show that the in vitro and in vivo efficacies of potential antagonists may not necessarily be closely correlated. Hence, there is a danger that potentially effective isolates may be discarded if decisions are made only on the basis of <b>preliminary</b> <b>screening</b> <b>tests</b> carried out under laboratory conditions...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Most {{denture base}} acrylic resins have {{polymethylmethacrylate}} in their composition. Several authors {{have discussed the}} polymerization process involved in converting monomer into polymer because adequate polymerization is a crucial factor in optimizing the physical properties and biocompatibility of denture base acrylic resins. To {{ensure the safety of}} these materials, in vitro cytotoxicity assays have been developed as <b>preliminary</b> <b>screening</b> <b>tests</b> to evaluate material biocompatibility. 3 H-thymidine incorporation test, which measures the number of cells synthesizing DNA, is one of the biological assays suggested for cytotoxicity testing. Aim: The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate, using 3 H-thymidine incorporation test, the effect of microwave and water-bath post-polymerization heat treatments on the cytotoxicity of two denture base acrylic resins. Materials and Methods: Nine disc-shaped specimens (10 x 1 mm) of each denture base resin (Lucitone 550 and QC 20) were prepared according to the manufacturers' recommendations and stored in distilled water at 37 °C for 48 h. The specimens were assigned to 3 groups: 1) post-polymerization in a microwave oven for 3 min at 500 W; 2) post-polymerization in water-bath at 55 °C for 60 min; and 3) without post-polymerization. For preparation of eluates, 3 discs were placed into a sterile glass vial with 9 mL of Eagle's medium and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The cytotoxic effect of the eluates was evaluated by 3 H-thymidine incorporation. Results: The results showed that the components leached from the resins were cytotoxic to L 929 cells, except for the specimens heat treated in water bath (p< 0. 05). Compared to the group with no heat treatment, water-bath decreased the cytotoxicity of the denture base acrylic resins. Conclusion: The in vitro cytotoxicity of the tested denture base materials was not influenced by microwave post-polymerization heat treatment...|$|R
40|$|Platinum-based {{drugs are}} {{well-established}} as effective antitumor agents, the progenitor being cisplatin. However, since their therapeutic effectiveness is decreased due to some severe side-effects, {{the design and}} development of alternative metal-based anticancer agents are still a challenge. In this context, {{we have been studying}} gold(III) -dithiocarbamato derivatives of amino acids and oligopeptides with outstanding in vitro and in vivo activity along with negligible or no systemic toxicity. Notably, these compounds showed no cross-resistance to cisplatin. The most recent potential drugs were designed as carrier-mediated delivery systems exploiting peptide transporters, up-regulated in some cancer types. Among them, we focused our studies on two compounds {{which turned out to be}} very promising in <b>preliminary</b> <b>screening</b> <b>tests</b> on different human tumor cell lines. Recently, we performed some tests on the triple-negative MDA-MB- 231, highly metastatic, invasive and resistant to cisplatin, breast cancer cells. Our compounds showed interesting in vitro cytotoxic properties towards the aforementioned cancer cell line and in vivo on xenografts. Actually, an average 53 % inhibition of tumor growth was recorded compared to control, after 27 days of treatment at 1. 0 mg kg- 1 d- 1. Remarkably, some mice showed tumor shrinkage. With respect to their mechanism of action, we identified the proteasome as a major in vitro and in vivo target, thus suggesting a different mechanism of action compared to platinum-based drugs. Moreover, the treated mice did not show signs of weight loss, anorexia and/or fatigue. The acute toxicity studies, carried out on two groups of 40 mice, recognized the iv and per os well-tolerated doses in 15 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg, respectively. This class of compounds is expected to enter phase I clinical trials in a few month...|$|R

All but O. vulgare essential oils exhibited strong fumigant toxicity to all developmental stages of T. confusum. In general, 10 day-old larvae were the most susceptible and the 25 and 31 day-old larvae were the most tolerant. LC 50 values ranging between 1. 8 and 109 μl/l air depending on the essential oil and insect developmental stage, age and sex. Furthermore, pupae exposed to these essential oil vapours showed various degrees of inhibition of morphogenesis. © Benaki Phytopathological Institute...|$|R
