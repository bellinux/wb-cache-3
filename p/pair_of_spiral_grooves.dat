30|$|If β′ {{can be made}} {{consistent}} with the design curve <b>of</b> a <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> on the workpiece surface through an adjustment, then the abrasive balls will generate a relative helical motion that runs against the curve <b>of</b> a <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> on the surface, thereby producing a cutting polish. The design curve <b>of</b> a <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> on the workpiece surface is taken as a reference for the relative motion of the abrasive balls. Therefore, not only can the polishing mentioned above reduce the surface roughness <b>of</b> a <b>spiral</b> <b>groove,</b> it can also correct any errors in shape.|$|R
30|$|During the {{polishing}} process, it {{was found}} that the surface roughness <b>of</b> the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> and the outer surface were not changed much at 5, 10, and 15  min, and the surface roughness was significantly lower than that <b>of</b> the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> at a time of 20  min. The roughness <b>of</b> the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> and the outer surface are basically the same at 50  min, and no longer change. In this case, the Ra value was 0.93  μm as determined using a hand-held surface roughness meter. Therefore, it can be determined that the surface roughness value Ra <b>of</b> the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> is also 0.93  μm. This indicates that the limit of the surface roughness for the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> polishing under this particular process condition is 0.93  μm.|$|R

50|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>groove</b> {{bearings}} (journal and thrust) are self-acting, or hydrodynamic bearings used {{to reduce}} friction and wear {{without the use of}} pressurized lubricants. They have this ability due to special patterns <b>of</b> <b>grooves.</b> <b>Spiral</b> <b>groove</b> bearings are self-acting because their own rotation builds up the pressure needed to separate the bearing surfaces.

40|$|AbstractAimed at the {{downstream}} <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> {{structure in}} the cylindrical gas seal, the analysis and calculation were carried out with the change of different structure parameters and the stability performance of the seal. The three dimensional model <b>of</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> cylindrical seal were built and simulated by Fluent. The hydrodynamic gas pressure distribution and the related regular curves including load, frictional torque and leakage were obtained with the change of seal structure parameters. The calculated {{results indicate that the}} gas film pressure shows as indention distributing and pressure peaks appear in the film thickness reducing area. Sealing structure parameters on the sealing stability performance have different effects, but the frictional torque is hardly influenced by <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> parameters. The recommended parameters of sealing structure are obtained...|$|R
40|$|The spiral-grooved seal {{is a prime}} {{candidate}} for application to liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopumps. A theoretical model of double spiral–grooved seals dealing with the viscosity–temperature relation is presented. The effect of operating parameters (rotational speed, supply pressure) and configurative parameters (depth <b>of</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>groove)</b> on the basic static characteristics (opening force, leakage, static friction torque, face temperature, and power loss) of double spiral–grooved seals are examined. Comparisons are presented between measurements and theoretical predications for a narrow spiral-grooved face seal with an average diameter of 100 mm, operating at high speed and using water as a test fluid. The theoretical and experimental {{results indicate that the}} temperature on seal faces rises and friction torque increases with the speed and supply pressure, and these increases vary slightly with the depth <b>of</b> the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove.</b> These findings lend great theoretical and experimental insights to the design of face seals applied in liquid engine turbopumps...|$|R

The lubricating oil supplied by this pump has a large influence on the performance and reliability, but the oil viscosity pump is designed based on the experience. We investigated the flow characteristics of the oil viscosity pump from theoretical and experimental study.

30|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>groove</b> dry {{gas seal}} (S-DGS), {{the most widely used}} DGS in the world, {{encounters}} the problem of high leakage rate and inferior film stability when used in high-speed machinery equipment, which could not be well solved by optimization of geometrical parameters and molded line <b>of</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>groove.</b> A new type <b>of</b> bionic cluster <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> DGS (CS-DGS) is proved to have superior film stability than S-DGS at the condition of high-speed and low-pressure numerically. A bionic CS-DGS is experimentally investigated and compared with common S-DGS in order to provide evidence for theoretical study. The film thickness and leakage rate <b>of</b> both bionic <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> and common <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> DGS are measured and compared {{with each other and with}} theoretical values under different closing force at the condition of static pressure, high-speed and low-pressure, and the film stiffness and stiffness-leakage ratio of these two face seals are derived by the relationship between closing force and film thickness at the steady state. Experimental results agree well with the theory that the leakage and stiffness of bionic CS-DGS are superior to that of common S-DGS under the condition of high-speed and low-pressure, with the decreasing amplitude of 20 % to 40 % and the growth amplitude of 20 %, respectively. The opening performance and stiffness characteristics of bionic CS-DGS are inferior to that of common S-DGS when rotation speed equals to 0 r/min. The proposed research provides a new method to measure the axis film stiffness of DGS, and validates the superior performance of bionic CS-DGS at the condition of high-speed and low-pressure experimentally.|$|R

As a result, its groove shape is much more complicated than that of a common rotor <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> [21]. Therefore, it is of universal significance for the polishing <b>of</b> a rotor <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> to verify the groove drum.|$|R

50|$|Barrel types include rifled—a series <b>of</b> <b>spiraled</b> <b>grooves</b> or angles {{within the}} barrel—when the {{projectile}} requires an induced spin to stabilize it, and smoothbore when the projectile is stabilized {{by other means}} or rifling is undesired or unnecessary. Typically, interior barrel diameter and the associated projectile size is a means to identify gun variations. Bore diameter is reported in several ways. The more conventional measure is reporting the interior diameter (bore) of the barrel in decimal fractions of the inch or in millimetres. Some guns—such as shotguns—report the weapon's gauge (which {{is the number of}} shot pellets having the same diameter as the bore produced from one English pound (454g) of lead) or—as in some British ordnance—the weight of the weapon's usual projectile.|$|R
40|$|Reliability, {{life and}} vehicle pay load can be {{enhanced}} by improved seals on space vehicle propulsion systems. Development of two types of fluid-film seals for application to advanced LOX turbomachines are summarized. The first is a floating ring, helium buffered seal whose function is to exclude intrusion of liquid oxygen (LOX) into the turbine drive. The other is a <b>spiral</b> <b>groove,</b> LOX, face-type configuration designed to break down pressure and minimize leakage of LOX. The Rayleigh-step, floating ring gas seals require low clearances to minimize leakage and stiff films to assure tracking excursions of the rotor and to overcome Coulomb friction between the rings and housings. The design and test results of these buffer seals are described. Results indicate significant performance improvement over seals used on contemporary engines. The possibilities of reducing helium storage requirements and thus increasing payload appear promising. A unique configuration <b>of</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> LOX seal was required to avoid detrimental vaporization in the flow path. It was found that fluid turbulence and inertia influence groove geometry and in particular groove depth must be much greater than <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> seals using conventional fluids...|$|R

40|$|The <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> {{thrust bearing}} can be {{operated}} at the dynamic stable condition and furthermore {{can bring a}} large load capacity comparing with the other type of gas bearing such as the Rayleigh pad or the tilting pad types. Accordingly this type of gas bearing {{has been used as}} a practical one for a thrust gas bearing of rotary performance. Although the principle and its function have been studied much enough on their theoretical points, it is quite difficult at present to get the plentiful experimental data for practical design. In the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> thrust bearing, when the pad which has the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> on the surface rotates over the other surface, the air as lubricant can be introduced into the centre of the bearing along the centre line <b>of</b> the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> (call it as pumping-in condition). Consequently the pressure can yield the load capacity to separate each surface, but if the depth of the groove is too much high to keep the air in it, the leakage of air will become larger and loose its load capacity. Thereupon the number <b>of</b> the <b>grooves,</b> a <b>spiral</b> angle, the depth of the groove and the bearing clearance are the main and important design factors to confine the ability. The present paper reports a few results which we could get from the experiments to determine the effect of the groove depth on the dynamic properties <b>of</b> the <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> thrust bearing. And we discuss also whether the experimental values agree well with the theoretical ones or not...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The three {{dimensional}} {{model was}} established for studying performance <b>of</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>groove</b> gas face seal. According to machining features of different surface area, the seal face {{can be divided}} into three parts, rotor ring grooved area, rotor ring non-grooved area and static ring area. The effect of roughness on seal performance was analyzed based on calculation of three dimensional flow field. The analysis results show that the surface roughness of rotor ring grooved area has great influence on the seal performance, but the influence is little when roughness on non-grooved rotor ring surface and static ring surface. The influence must be considered when surface roughness of rotor ring grooved area bigger than 0. 2 µm. Roughness of rotor ring surface can increase the loading force while it also can cause the increase of leakage. It is important to select rational roughness when designing gas face seal...|$|R
