30|$|The {{experiments}} are conducted in three setup of series and are Specimens of Series-A (5 number of 1.2  mm thick channel specimen with three numbers of bolts at the joint). Specimens of Series-B (five number of 1.5  mm thick channel specimen with three numbers of bolts at the joint). In both the specimen series A and B, these five specimens having same cross section where first sample is tested without <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> and remaining samples are tested using <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> of varying thickness i.e., 2, 3, 4, and 5  mm. Specimens of Series-C (two number of 1.5  mm thick channel specimen with single bolt at the joint). In this, two specimens are used {{having the same}} cross section and {{the thickness of the}} <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> used was 4  mm, where first sample is tested without <b>packing</b> <b>plate.</b> The results will be plotted to load vs. deformation curves for the specimens.|$|E
30|$|To {{study the}} effect of channel of size (50  ×  40) with varying {{thickness}} of <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> were selected. The cold form sections are having thin sections and fails at the bolted connection due to bearing and rupture along with buckling. The introduction of <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> at bolted connections distributes load over wide area of cold form channel webs and also avoids buckling of web element and hence increases the load carrying capacity of the joint. It is observed that as the <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> thickness increases, the bending of channel at unconnected leg decreases. With {{the increase in the}} thickness of <b>packing</b> <b>plate,</b> a total of 5.8  % average increase in the strength of the each specimen is observed in 1.2  mm specimen sample. And 5.5  % of average increase in the strength of the each specimen is observed in 1.5  mm thick specimen. The above results are for the joints of three bolted connections. For single bolt connection, the percentage of increase in the joint is more due to length of outstanding.|$|E
30|$|It is {{observed}} {{from the above}} Tables {{by the use of}} <b>packing</b> <b>plates</b> that the load carrying capacity of the joint increases. As the thickness of the light gauge section increases, the variation in increase of joint strength reduces for various thicknesses of <b>packing</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R

30|$|For 1.2  mm thick channel section, it is {{observed}} that all failures are due to rupture with three bolts connection, and also for 1.5  mm thick channel section up to 3  mm thick <b>packing</b> <b>plate,</b> the failure is due to rupture and for 4  mm thick <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> the failure is due to vertical shear failure along the line of vertical connection.

40|$|Traditional {{fossil fuels}} such as coal, {{gas and oil}} are still major {{candidates}} to fulfill the energy requirement but their depletion at sharp rate due to increase in demand is at alarming condition. High prices and environmental pollution issues associated with fossil fuels has diverted thefocus {{of the world to}} find out the new energy roots. Biomass is one of energy candidates, environment friendly, which can be utilized to generate heat and power. Biomass can be converted into useful products by thermochemical process such as gasification. This study focuses on to design and development of pilot scale updraft gasifier with gas cleaning unit. Performance analysis in terms of producer gas composition, LHV of producer gas, A/G,G/F, gasifier efficiency and gasification efficiency for different biomass materials at different air flow with and without the <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> was studied. Other main objective was to find out energy potential of mango pit shell as new biomass material and its comparison with coconut shell, ginisyria (Gliricidia sepium) and a mixture of 50 %, 25 %, 25 % coconut shell, mango pit shell and Gliricidia sepium respectively as an arbitrary selection. Bench scale updraft gasifier was designed and fabricated. Elemental analysis for each biomass was performed in laboratory to find out the properties such as moisture contents, ash contents, volatile matters etc. Reactor was operated successfully, producer gas and other useful byproducts was obtained. Producer gas was analyzed for compositional analysis as major product and reactors performance parameters was calculated. It has been observed that biomass we utilized contains the sufficient energy potential. In case of without <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> at ER of 0. 2 LHV (MJ/Nm 3) of producer gas was 4. 40, 3. 35, 4. 20, 3. 14 for coconut shell, mango pit shell, ginisyria and mixture respectively. When air flow rate increased, ER increased up to 0. 25 it was observed that LHV of producer gas has been decreased. With <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> experiments it has been found that LHV of producer gas at ER of 0. 2 is 4. 02, 3. 29, 3. 70, and 3. 21 for coconut shell, mango pit shell, ginisyria and mixture respectively. In <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> case as well with increase of air flow decrease in LHV of producer gas was observed. Collectively without <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> results obtained are good as compare to with <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> case. Gasifier thermal efficiency for different biomass has been found in the range of assumed designed value which was 70 %. Bio-char and black condensate was obtained as valuable by products which can be utilized for different applications. Mango pit shell which is thrown as waste can be utilized as biomass to generate the heat and fulfill the respective industry energy demand especially juice industry.

30|$|Cold-formed {{structural}} members {{are being used}} more widely in routine structural design as the world steel industry moves from the production of hot-rolled section and plate to coil and strip, often with galvanized and/or painted coatings. Steel in this form is more easily delivered from the steel mill to the manufacturing plant where it is usually cold-rolled into open and closed section members. In the present experimental study, the use of <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> at the joints in cold-formed channel sections may increase the load carrying capacity and also reduce the buckling of unconnected cold form channel steel plate at joints. The present study focuses on examining the experimental investigation to use mild steel as a <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> with cold-formed channel sections by bolted connection at the joints and the connection subjected to axial tension. Series of tests are carried out with increase in the thickness of <b>packing</b> <b>plate</b> and results are observed and analyzed. Total Twelve experimental tests {{have been carried out}} on cold-formed channel tension members fastened with single as well as three numbers of bolts at the connection and from the observations the strength of the joint is increased by increasing the various thicknesses of packing plates and also the buckling of unconnected leg of channel specimen is reduced. It is analyzed by plotting the entire load versus elongation path, so that the behavior of the connection is examined.|$|E

Additionally, the connection spacing (bolted connection with stitch plates in-between the angles) and the presence of a connection at mid-length change the buckling mode, as well as cause a significantly increase in the axial compression strength of the member. The numerical analysis also indicates that the design proposed by ABNT NBR 8800 : 2008 for the case involving angles under compression connected by one flap can also be applied to cold formed steel angles...|$|R

The sodium chloride maintains the osmotic equilibrium. Because the entire double-bagged product is subjected to a sterilizing dose of gamma radiation, the contents inside the outer bag are sterile. 6 This allows the inner bag to be aseptically removed without introducing contaminants.

Storage in vacuum pack mainly affected viable counts and not necessarily the species diversity of microbial populations on meat. Such populations were studied by PCR-DGGE of DNA directly extracted from meat and from bulk cells from culture media, followed by sequencing of DGGE fragments. Pseudomonas spp., Carnobacterium divergens, Brochothrix thermosphacta, Rahnella spp. and Serratia grimesii, or close relatives were detected in the meat at time zero. The use of the culture-independent method highlighted the occurrence of species that were not detected by plating.
