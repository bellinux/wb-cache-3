50|$|A WWN may be {{employed}} {{in a variety of}} roles, such as a serial number or for addressability; for example, in Fibre Channel networks, a WWN may be used as a WWNN (World Wide Node Name) to identify an endpoint, or a WWPN (World Wide <b>Port</b> <b>Name)</b> to identify an individual port on a switch. Two WWNs which do not refer to the same thing should always be different even if the two are used in different roles, i.e. a role such as WWPN or WWNN does not define a separate WWN space. The use of burned-in addresses and specification compliance by vendors is relied upon to enforce uniqueness.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a calculus for concurrent and communicating processes, {{which is a}} direct and simple extension of the lambda-calculus. The communication mechanism we use is that of Milner's calculus CCS: to communicate consists in synchronously sending and receiving a value through a shared port. Then the calculus is parameterized on a given set of port names, which {{are used in the}} two primitives for sending and receiving a value -as in the lambda-calculus, a value can be any term. We use two parallel constructs: the first is interleaving, which does not allow communication between agents. The second, called cooperation, is a synchronizing construct which forces two agents to communicate on every <b>port</b> <b>name.</b> We show that the lambda-calculus is a simple sub-calculus of ours: lambda-abstraction is a particular case of reception (on a port named lambda), and application is a particular case of cooperation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a direct {{combination}} of the -calculus with concepts from concurrency is introduced. Abstraction and (self) application from the -calculus are maintained as primitive constructs in the combined calculus, which incorporates also notions of (non) deterministic choice, concurrent and sequential composition, communication, encapsulation and hiding as in Process Algebra (CCS, etc.). In this setting is just an arbitrary <b>port</b> <b>name</b> without any special role. We give an operational semantics to the combined calculus, where process application appears as a generalisation of function application. The combined calculus has great expressive power: recursive constructs appear through self application and data objects are just component processes in concurrent constructs. Key Words & Phrases: concurrency, process algebra, process calculi, -calculus, abstraction, communication, (self) application. 1985 Mathematics Subject Classification: 03 B 40, 68 Q 05, 68 Q 10. 1987 CR Categories: D. 3. 1, F. 1 [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|Overview The INQUIRY Device Identification VPD page (83 h) returns logical unit, target port, and (with 02 - 254) {{target device}} related identifiers. However, it has several {{limitations}} for iSCSI, SRP, and SBP- 2 devices, and for devices with target ports using {{more than one}} transport protocols: 1. iSCSI port names and device names use a string format that cannot be represented in the current VPD formats. The strings approach 256 bytes in length; 02 - 303 expanded INQUIRY’s allocation length to return such amounts of data. Suggestion: A new VPD device identifier type for this string format is needed so iSCSI devices can report its target port (ASSOCIATION field set to 1 h) and target device identifiers (ASSOCIATION field set to 2 h). 2. iSCSI logical unit names are undefined. RAID controllers tend to name their logical units (reported with ASSOCIATION field set to 0 h) by concatenating a self-generated number {{to the end of}} a <b>port</b> <b>name</b> (e. g. the NAA IEEE Registered Extended identifier is 64 bits concatenated onto an IEEE Registered identifier).

40|$|The IDENTIFY DEVICE command {{includes}} an optional World Wide Name field containing an IEEE NAA Registered identifier in words 108 - 111. Serial Attached SCSI HBAs may {{use this to}} identify that the drive is the same even if it changes locations in the SCSI domain (the SAS address given to a drive {{is based on the}} expander phy to which it is attached). e 05178 r 0 proposes the field be upgraded to mandatory. The IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE command does not currently define that field. It would be helpful if it were optionally available, and if implemented by an ATAPI device supporting SCSI commands, matched the SCSI target device name returned in the SCSI INQUIRY command Device Identification VPD page (83 h). The other SCSI names/identifiers it could be each have problems: a) It cannot serve as the SCSI target <b>port</b> <b>name,</b> because if the SATA device is behind a SATA port selector, the same name appears in two different domains. b) It cannot serve as the SCSI target port identifier, because the value is not actually used for addressing within any domains. In SAS, the expander to which the SATA device is attached assigns it a SAS address. An advanced expander could send IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE to retrieve the World Wide Name and use that as the SAS address, but this is not required in SAS- 1. 1. c) It cannot serve as the logical unit name, because the PACKET command payload might include a SCSI- 2 compatible LOGICAL UNIT NUMBER field in the CDB (byte 1 bits 7 : 5), and each logical unit name must be unique. For IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE, the World Wide Name needs to be optional, because ATAPI DVD drives, which are the most common packet devices, have little need.
