50|$|Diesel rotary {{uninterruptible}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>devices</b> (DRUPS) {{combine the}} functionality of a battery-powered or flywheel-powered UPS and a diesel generator. When mains electricity supply is within specification, an electrical generator {{with a mass}} functions as motor to store kinetic energy in an electro-mechanical flywheel. In combination with a reactor or choke coil, the electrical generator also works as active filter {{for all sorts of}} power quality problems, like harmonics, RFI, and frequency variations. When mains electricity supply fails, stored energy in the flywheel is released to drive the electrical generator, which continues to supply power without interruption. At the same time (or with some delay, for example 2 to 11 seconds, to prevent the diesel engine from starting at every incident), the diesel engine takes over from the flywheel to drive the electrical generator to make the electricity required. The electro-magnetic flywheel can continue to support the diesel generator in order to keep a stable output frequency. Typically a DRUPS will have enough fuel to power the load for days or even weeks in the event of failure of the mains electricity supply.|$|E

30|$|As a {{new class}} of energy storage device, supercapacitors, also known as {{electrochemical}} capacitors, has received considerable attention {{that can be used in}} hybrid electric vehicles, memory backup, and other emergency <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>devices</b> due to their higher power density, superior cycle lifetime, and low maintenance cost. However, the energy density of supercapacitors is lower than batteries [1 – 6]. It is highly desirable to increase the energy density of supercapacitors to approach that of batteries, which could enable their use as primary power sources. Supercapacitors store electrical energy by two mechanisms [7, 8]: electrochemical double-layer capacitance (EDLC) and pseudocapacitance. In EDLC, the capacitance comes from the charge accumulated at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Carbon-based materials are widely used in EDLC electrode due to their high surface area and excellent electric conductivity. Compared to EDLCs, pseudocapacitors can provide much higher capacitance and energy density through Faradic reaction [6, 7]. Transition metal oxides and conducting polymers are the promising candidates because they can provide high energy density for pseudocapacitors. It has been found that carbon materials which combine with pseudocapacitive electrode materials can improve the capacitance of supercapacitors [8 – 10].|$|E

40|$|Due to {{implementation}} of routing protocols in limited <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>devices</b> in {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs), this paper presents and evaluates Rainbow Collection Tree Protocol (RCTP) as an enhanced version of Collection Tree Protocol (CTP). CTP is a lightweight, efficient, robust, and also reliable routing protocol for WSNs. CTP as a cross layer routing protocol is also a platform-independent protocol. It uses Trickle Algorithm to optimize the overhead cost and also makes it quickly adaptable to changes in topology. The basic foundation of CTP is on link quality identification and it uses expected transmission count (ETX). ETX is not stable during the time in real environments and ETX fluctuations cause the routing protocols to not work in optimum level. RCTP uses average expected transmission count (AETX) as link quality metric that has shown it is more stable than ETX. It also uses a new mechanism in parent selection {{to make it more}} accurate.

CTP is a light routing protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) that the basic foundation is on following the data toward the sink with minimum overhead. CTP uses ETX as link communication quality metric between nodes. The previous researches show that ETX is not stable during the time in real environment and its fluctuation causes the routing protocols make mistake to choose the best path to the destination. CTP-R uses AETX as link metric that it has been shown is more stable than ETX. CTP-R is a cross-layer integration of tree topology and quality link metric to select the relay node plus a mechanism to make it capable to avoid the dead end routes and finally detect and route around connectivity holes. Detecting and routing around connectivity holes (Rainbow) could enhance performance of CTP to avoid the dead end routes and also loop routes without increasing any overhead to the system.
