25|$|Upon {{investigation}} of eastern women’s lives, {{they found that}} though the GDR’s socialist policies encouraged women in the labor force, {{there had been no}} women creating these policies. Once again, the patriarch had created a <b>public</b> <b>history</b> in which women were cut out. The discovery of neglected cultural accounts, similar to Fiedler’s, has allowed women’s historians to create large databases, available to feminist historians, out of them. These sources are analyzed by the historians to compare them to scholarly works published during the same time period. Finding works that are within the same time period isn’t too difficult, but the challenge is in knowing how to combine what they learned from the source with what they know from the works.|$|E
25|$|As Middle Tennessee State University {{developed}} and grew, the Doctor of Arts program was added in 1970 and the Specialist in Education in 1974. These degree programs became attractive centerpieces for other {{efforts to improve}} and enhance institutional roles. Library resources were dramatically increased and sophisticated computer services were developed to aid instruction and administration. A highly trained faculty enabled the university to continue growth in program offerings. In 1991, the university's six schools—five undergraduate and the graduate school—became colleges. In 1998, MTSU's Honors program became the Honors College, {{the first in the}} state. In 2002, approval was granted to redesignate three D.A. programs to Doctor of Philosophy programs, expanding the progressive institution's offerings. Ph.D. degree offerings now include computational sciences, mathematics and science education (including concentrations in biology education, chemistry education, mathematics education and interdisciplinary science education), molecular biosciences, economics, English, human performance, <b>public</b> <b>history</b> and literacy studies.|$|E
500|$|Of Winson Green, Chinn {{writes that}} it was {{originally}} developed as a [...] "better-off working class district", but that by {{the latter part of}} the 20th century many of the properties in the area were falling into decay. Dr Chris Upton, reader in <b>public</b> <b>history</b> at the city's Newman University, has described the street as part of a [...] "ribbon development" [...] of suburban districts built as Birmingham expanded during {{the latter part of the}} 19th century. While many of the street's original residents were locals who moved from the inner city back-to-back houses, some had moved from as far away as London and Cornwall to work in Birmingham. Upton describes them as [...] "the respectable working class"skilled workers who earned around 30 shillings (£1.50) per week, and who in many cases could even afford to employ a maid. Those who grew prosperous moved to wealthier areas, and were replaced by immigrants from Asia and the West Indies, who came to the UK during the years after World War II. A high proportion of those who lived in the area were employed by Birmingham's industrial economy, which enjoyed prosperity until the collapse of the city's manufacturing industry during the early 1980s, resulting in mass unemployment. Professor Steven McCabe of Birmingham City Business School has noted that Birmingham lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs between 1971 and 1981, and that the city's GDP per capita, which in 1976 was the highest for a UK city outside the south east region, had fallen to become the lowest in England seven years later.|$|E
