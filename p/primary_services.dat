Using this approach, the impacts of the secondary service parameters {{as well as the}} wireless environment on the <b>primary</b> <b>service</b> outage probability are analyzed. We further obtain a closed form for the <b>primary</b> <b>service</b> outage probability based on the transmit power of the secondary service as well as miss detection probability of the spectrum sensing. Furthermore, we obtain the maximum secondary service transmitter node density for a given outage probability constraint of the <b>primary</b> <b>service.</b> We also derived an upper bound to the achievable capacity of the <b>primary</b> <b>service.</b> Simulations results confirm the analytical derivations.
