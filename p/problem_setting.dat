30|$|The fourth {{paper by}} Noguchi, Kogure, Konishi, and Itoh, Practice Supporting System with Related <b>Problem</b> <b>Set</b> Generator Based on Targeted Educational Effects, {{suggested}} an intelligent tutoring system that generates <b>sets</b> of similar <b>problems,</b> {{each of which}} is related to a certain educational target and supports exercises with the <b>problem</b> <b>sets.</b> An exercise in a classroom uses a set of multiple similar problems solved with common knowledge. To provide an appropriate <b>problem</b> <b>set,</b> teachers must carefully choose problems related with essential knowledge but that is not easy. The paper described an approach to generate such <b>problem</b> <b>sets</b> in the domain of high school chemistry. It empirically classified <b>problem</b> <b>sets</b> collected from textbooks and designed methods to generate similar problems for each type of the sets by transforming a problem. It then implemented the intelligent tutoring system by extending a previous system that can solve problems and explain about them. It also experimentally evaluated <b>problem</b> <b>sets</b> generated by the system and preliminary confirm the educational effect of exercises using the system.|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{the authors}} aim to {{identify}} the causal effect {{of the use of}} graded <b>problem</b> <b>sets</b> on academic performance of Spanish students. The identification strategy relies on an experiment in which the authors exploit variation arising from observing the performance of nearly 300 students taking the same class during the same semester and with the same instructors. Academic performance is measured through a multiple choice final exam in which some questions are related to graded <b>problem</b> <b>sets</b> and others are related to non-graded <b>problem</b> <b>sets</b> given through the semester. After accounting for potential biases and selection concerns, the results show that graded <b>problem</b> <b>sets</b> increase test scores by eight percentage points, or close to a letter grade...|$|R
50|$|Exploration {{involves}} giving students room {{to problem}} solve {{on their own}} and teaching students exploration strategies. The former requires the teacher to slowly withdraw the use of supports and scaffolds not only in problem solving methods, but <b>problem</b> <b>setting</b> methods as well. The latter requires the teacher to show students how to explore, research, and develop hypotheses. Exploration allows the student to frame interesting problems within the domain for themselves and then take the initiative to solve these problems.|$|E
50|$|The <b>problem</b> <b>setting</b> in {{sensitivity}} analysis also has strong similarities {{with the field}} of design of experiments. In a design of experiments, one studies the effect of some process or intervention (the 'treatment') on some objects (the 'experimental units'). In {{sensitivity analysis}} {{one looks at the}} effect of varying the inputs of a mathematical model on the output of the model itself. In both disciplines one strives to obtain information from the system with a minimum of physical or numerical experiments.|$|E

50|$|Sandrich {{was born}} in New York City, to a Jewish family. His sister was Ruth Harriet Louise. He was an {{engineering}} student at Columbia University when he accidentally fell into the film business. While visiting a friend on a film set, {{he saw that the}} director had a <b>problem</b> <b>setting</b> up a shot; Sandrich offered his advice. It worked. He entered into the movies in the prop department, and became a director specializing in several comedy shorts in 1927. His first feature was Runaway Girls, in 1928. In an exciting time in the film business with the arrival of sound, Mark briefly returned to shorts. In 1933, he directed the Academy Award-winning short, So This Is Harris! This stroke of luck brought Mark's return to feature films. He most notably directed comedies, starring the team of Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey in Hips, Hips, Hooray!. In 1934, Sandrich gained his first directorial assignment with the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical The Gay Divorcee, which proved a tremendous success.|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} how technical communication {{practitioners and}} teachers can approach Donald Schön’s notion of <b>problem</b> <b>setting</b> as rheto-rical and reflective work that offers us a richer, more precise language for articulating the technologies, narratives, and values from which problems appear as {{problems in the}} first place.

Some considerations about climate change, macroeconomics and their relationship are given.

Problems of this type have been studied extensively by (dynamic) game theory. A rough literature review is provided and some items open for future research are indicated. ...|$|E
