In 1925 an additional 5 were ordered from Robert Stephenson and Company in Darlington and built with the larger G9BS boilers, becoming numbers 86-90. Two locomotives, 9679 (ex-89) and 9680 (ex-90) received the smaller G9AS boiler in 1930, while the remaining three retained the larger boiler until it was replaced in the 1950s - 53808 in 1953; 53807 in 1954; and 53806 in 1955. These locomotives gained a <b>packing</b> <b>piece</b> between the smaller boiler and original smokebox saddle. The exception was 53807, the smokebox saddle being rotten and replaced with a one-piece unit like the 1914-built locomotives. This locomotive was therefore unique, as only left-hand drive locomotive with a one piece smokebox saddle.|$|E
50|$|Noble {{had assumed}} the cotters {{were too small}} and had not been driven up hard in the first place, but on the {{chattering}} ties the cotters were loose, and even if driven fully in would not fill the slot and put the bar under tension. By fitting an additional <b>packing</b> <b>piece</b> between loose cotters and driving the cotters in, Noble had re-tightened loose ties and stopped them chattering. There were over 4,000 gib and cotter joints on the bridge, but Noble said that only about 100 had had to be re-tensioned, most in October-November 1878. On his last check in December 1879, only two ties had needed attention, both on piers north of the high girders.Noble had found cracks in four column sections - one under the high girders, three {{to the north of}} them - which had then been bound with wrought iron hoops. Noble had consulted Bouch about the cracked columns, but not the chattering ties.|$|E

The transponders are interconnected over multiple circular chains, such that identification characteristics of all faultless transponders are read after reading the transponders. Identification characteristics of a defect transponder (5 c) are determined. A completely closed chain is provided for testing integrity of a loading unit (1). USE - Method for group-reading of wirelessly readable transponders i. e. radio frequency identification tags, in <b>packing</b> <b>pieces</b> of a loading unit. ADVANTAGE - The method detects the number of identification-numbers of the transponders of the loading unit in fast and secure manner, thus reducing the time for group-reading of the transponders in the <b>packing</b> <b>pieces</b> with unique identification characteristics, and ensuring error detection of the transponders...|$|R

Cochrane added that the bolt would bend permanently (and slacken its tiebar to about the extent that had {{had to be taken}} up by <b>packing</b> <b>pieces)</b> at an even lower loading than that at which the cotters would deform; he had found some bent tiebar bolts as apparent confirmation.|$|R

40|$|Given {{a set of}} {{rectangular}} {{pieces and}} a rectangular container, the two-dimensional knapsack problem (2 D-KP) consists of orthogonally packing {{a subset of the}} pieces within the container such that the sum of the values of the <b>packed</b> <b>pieces</b> is maximized. If the value of a piece is given by its area the objective is to maximize the covered area of the container. A genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed addressing the guillotine case of the 2 D-KP as well as the non-guillotine case. Moreover, an orientation constraint may optionally be taken into account and the given piece set may be constrained or unconstrained. The GA is subjected to an extensive test using well-known benchmark instances. In a comparison to recently published methods the GA yields competitive results. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{one-dimensional}} partitioning and packing {{problems of the}} following type are investigated. The pieces, which are to be packed, are assumed to have a variable length in a given range. Furthermore, the placement of any <b>packed</b> <b>piece</b> has to fulfill additional allocation constraints. The value of a piece is dependent affine linearly on its length. Find a feasible partition or packing, resp., with maximum total value. For these problems mixed-integer optimization models with linear constraints are developed and suitable solution methods are discussed.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Baskett's "Puzzle" {{benchmark}} {{has been}} used for almost a decade for the evaluation of hardware architectures, and was included in the "Gabriel" suite of Lisp benchmarks [Gabriel 85]. "Puzzle" solves a 3 -dimensional packing problem by attempting to <b>pack</b> <b>pieces</b> of 4 different types into a 5 x 5 x 5 cube. The class of such packing problems is closely related to the "bin-packing" and "knapsack" problems of complexity theory, which are known to be NP-complete [Baase 78]. Thus, while it is unlikely that clever programming will allow us to escape the asymptotic exponential behavior of these problems, it can gain us some very real performance improvements. It is worth studying packing problems because of their ubiquity in the real world. In addition to the obvious examples from business [...] -e. g., freight loading [...] -there are similarities with real problems in biochemical bonding. The standard version of Puzzle found in the Gabriel benchmark suite is an embarrassment for the Lis...|$|R

50|$|Early locomotive-powered {{railways}} {{had used}} short cast iron rails carried on stone blocks. A few were trying timber sleepers {{to support the}} rails and to maintain the gauge between them. These rails were brittle and broke easily, and they gave a rough ride due {{to the difficulty of}} maintaining a smooth line between the blocks or sleepers. Wrought iron rails were being manufactured but they were of poor quality due to the difficulty of cooling them evenly during manufacture. Brunel decided to use a continuously supported wrought iron rail, a bridge rail with a smaller rail section that cooled more evenly. This was an inverted-U section with wide flanges that could be bolted to the timber bearer, which was known as a 'longitudinal' baulk. The rail was usually kept off this by small wooden <b>packing</b> <b>pieces</b> that could be replaced when they were worn out by the passage of the trains, and therefore avoid the expense of replacing the heavier longitudinals. The rails were bolted to the longitudinals by long fang bolts or coach screws, and the rail joints were later supported by a base plate formed with a plug in the void of the inverted U shape rails so as to keep the rails in line with each other.|$|R

The standard Royal Flying Corps synchroniser, the Vickers-Challenger gear, was unreliable, and in British service the over-wing Lewis gun was retained, mostly on the new Foster mounting, a curved metal rail which allowed the pilot to slide the gun back to change drums or clear jams. Some aircraft, particularly French, were fitted with both guns but a single machine gun was most common.The Nieuport 21 differed in primarily using the lower powered 80 hp Le Rhône 9C and {{was intended as a}} fighter trainer or high altitude bomber escort, however it was used alongside the Nieuport 17 in the normal fighter roles in French and Russian service.The Nieuport 23 differed from the 17 in only minor details, primarily centered around the use of a different machine gun synchronizer — which caused the gun to be offset and the fuel and oil tanks to be rearranged.
