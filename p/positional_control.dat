40|$|The {{objective}} of the operational television (OTV) technology {{was to develop a}} multiple camera system (up to 256 cameras) for NASA Kennedy installations where camera video, synchronization, control, and status data are transmitted bidirectionally via a single fiber cable at distances in excess of five miles. It is shown that the benefits (such as improved video performance, immunity from electromagnetic interference and radio frequency interference, elimination of repeater stations, and more system configuration flexibility) can be realized if application of the proven fiber optic transmission concept is used. The control system will marry the lens, pan and tilt, and camera control functions into a modular based Local Area Network (LAN) control network. Such a system does not exist commercially at present since the Television Broadcast Industry's current practice is to divorce the <b>positional</b> <b>controls</b> from the camera control system.

2500|$|The {{flippers}} are {{one or more}} small mechanically or electromechanically controlled levers, roughly 3 to 7cm in length, {{used for}} redirecting the ball up the playfield. They are the main control that the player has over the ball. Careful timing and <b>positional</b> <b>control</b> allows the player to intentionally direct the ball {{in a range of}} directions with various levels of velocity. With the flippers, the player attempts to move the ball to hit various types of scoring targets, and to keep the ball from disappearing off the bottom of the playfield. The very first pinball games appeared in the early 1930s and did not have flippers; after launch the ball simply proceeded down the playfield, directed by static nails (or [...] "pins") to one of several scoring areas. (These pins gave the game its name.) In 1947, the first mechanical flippers appeared on Gottlieb's Humpty Dumpty and by the early 1950s, the familiar two-flipper configuration, with the flippers {{at the bottom of the}} playfield above the center drain, had become standard. Some machines also added a third or fourth flipper midway up the playfield.|$|E

40|$|The {{controllability}} {{problem for}} nonlinear control systems with one-dimensional {{control of the}} form dx/dt=a(x) +B(x) β(x,u) is considered, where a(x) is an n-dimensional vector function, B(x) is an (n× m) -matrix, and β(x,u) is an m-dimensional vector function. Under certain conditions we reduce such system to a system consisting of m subsystems; in each subsystem all equations are linear except of the last one. We use the controllability function method to give sufficient conditions for controllability of the considered system. We propose an approach for construction of controls which transfer an arbitrary initial point to the rest point in a certain finite time. Each such control is constructed as a concatenation of {{a finite number of}} <b>positional</b> <b>controls</b> (we call it a stepwise synthesis control). On each step of our approach we choose a new synthesis control. Our approach essentially uses nonlinearity of a system with respect to a control. The obtained results are illustrated by examples. In particular, the problem of the complete stoppage of a two-link pendulum is solved. We also introduce the class of nonlinear systems which is called the class of staircase systems that provides the applicability of our approach...|$|R

Within the game-theoretical approach the problem of calculating the value of the optimal guaranteed result and constructing a <b>positional</b> (closed-loop) <b>control</b> law that ensures this result is posed. For this problem, an effective solution procedure based on the recurrent construction of upper convex hulls of auxiliary program functions is elaborated.

40|$|Initial {{inspiration}} {{for this project}} comes {{from the world of}} moving sculptures called mobiles. Artists such as Alexander Calder have pioneered the way by showing the world that mobiles can do more than entertain infants. This project brings the world of moving scultures to the computer and extends the artistic role mobiles can play for the average person. The primary objective of this project was to design and implement a tool to create and visualize simple mobiles. The application was to be flexible and easy to use. So easy in fact that a child should be able to construct a mobile with this software, view it, and perhaps even construct it with real materials guided by a plan printed on an ordinary printer. Of course, as a requirement for this thesis project emphasis was placed on obtaining a realistic 3 -D representational view of the finished mobile. The 3 -D view was to include real-time animation of the rotating finished mobile. Additional features included phong shading, a directional light source, <b>positional</b> <b>controls</b> for zoom in/zoom out, and rotational adjustment about the x-axis. (providing views from above and below) In addition, a great amount of effort was placed in developing an easy to use 2 -D design environment. The design environment is, in a sense, the antithesis of the classic CAD package. Instead of allowing for a large amount of drawing possibilities, with an even larger learning curve, I constructed an environment that limits what can be drawn but more importantly reduces the learning curve dramatically. The program takes only minutes to learn and is ideally suited to people within a wide range of age and ability...|$|R
