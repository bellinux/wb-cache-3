For example, cardiac defibrillator and artificial cardiac pacemaker (Barouh Berkovits), closed-chest cardiac defibrillator (William B. Kouwenhoven), laser (Gordon Gould), atom bomb (Frederick Reines), polio vaccine (Albert Sabin), RFID (Mario Cardullo), telephone handset (Robert G. Brown), wireless microphone (Hung-Chang Lin), first digital image scanner (Russell A. Kirsch), television (Benjamin Adler), light beer (Joseph Owades), non-stick cookware (John Gilbert), black hole thermodynamics (Jacob Bekenstein), polymer science (Herman Francis Mark), microwave (Ernst Weber), X-ray crystallography (Paul Peter Ewald), barcode (Jerome Swartz), structure of the DNA (Francis Crick), tau lepton (Martin Lewis Perl), processes for creating food coloring, decaffeination and sugar substitute (Torunn Atteraas Garin), processes for the mass production of penicillin (Jasper H. Kane), X-ray generator and rotational radiation therapy (John G. Trump), nuclear reactor and hydrogen bomb (John Archibald Wheeler), and contact lenses (Norman Gaylord), among many others. Alumnus Fred Waller who invented Cinerama and the Waller Gunnery Trainer, also obtained the first patent for a water ski. The first patents for touch screen cash machine (Richard J. Orford), and zoom lens (Leonard Bergstein), were also obtained by NYU alumni. Some of the most prolific inventors in American history are NYU alumni, for example Jerome H. Lemelson whose 605 patents involved the cordless telephone, fax machine, videocassette recorder and camcorder, among others; Samuel Ruben whose inventions include electric battery; James Wood who invented cable-lift elevator, fabricated the steel cables for the Brooklyn Bridge and contributed to the development of lockmaking, submarine, electric generator, electric motor, transformer and the design of the refrigerator; and Albert Macovski whose innovations include the single-tube color camera and real-time <b>phased</b> <b>array</b> imaging for ultrasound. NYU is the birthplace of the tractor beam and 5G. Before and during World War II, NYU's Tandon School of Engineering worked on problems whose solution {{led to the development of}} radar, and later broke ground in electromagnetic theory, electronics in general, and solved re-entry problems of the manned space capsules, as well as helped develop and design the NASDAQ Automated Quote System and trading floors. Developer of the early telephone systems in the United States Bancroft Gherardi Jr., developer of the submarine communications facilities Jack M. Sipress, inventor of Italy's first computer Mario Tchou, designer of the Panama Canal locks Henry C. Goldmark, designer of the Pentagon Hugh John Casey, designer of the Apollo Lunar Module Thomas J. Kelly, as well as the designer of virtually every major bridge in New York City from the George Washington to the Verrazano, Leopold Just, are also NYU alumni.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phased</b> <b>array</b> radars {{are valued}} {{for use in}} {{aircraft}} since they can track multiple targets. The first aircraft to use a <b>phased</b> <b>array</b> radar was the B-1B Lancer. The first fighter aircraft to use <b>phased</b> <b>array</b> radar was the Mikoyan MiG-31. The MiG-31M's SBI-16 Zaslon Passive electronically scanned array radar {{was considered to be}} the world's most powerful fighter radar, until the AN/APG-77 Active electronically scanned array was introduced on the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phased</b> <b>array</b> radars {{have been}} in use since the {{earliest}} years of radar in World War II (Mammut radar), but electronic device limitations led to poor performance. <b>Phased</b> <b>array</b> radars were originally used for missile defence (see for example Safeguard Program). They are {{the heart of the}} ship-borne Aegis Combat System and the Patriot Missile System. The massive redundancy associated with having a large number of array elements increases reliability at the expense of gradual performance degradation that occurs as individual phase elements fail. To a lesser extent, <b>Phased</b> <b>array</b> radars have been used in Weather Surveillance. As of 2017, NOAA plans to implement a national network of Multi-Function <b>Phased</b> <b>array</b> radars throughout the United States within 10 years, for meteorological studies and flight monitoring.|$|E

40|$|An active <b>phase</b> <b>array</b> {{receiver}} {{has many}} applications {{in areas of}} EM imaging (radar), advanced sonar and RF target tracking, among others. For example, <b>phase</b> <b>array</b> radar for the "Patriot " missile can steer the beam electronically, without moving parts, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can obtain a nearly photographic image of a surveyed area. The <b>phase</b> <b>array</b> receiver can form a very large aperture sensor (antenna), significantly enhancing the spatial resolution of the system. A <b>phase</b> <b>array</b> system {{can be used in}} applications outside high performance radar as well. The systems are employed in point-to-point communication in situations where jamming or noisy signals require a high gain and optimized spatial characteristics. Another important application is use as a target tracking device, where <b>phase</b> <b>array</b> systems can resolve the position vector of a tracked object. This paper proposes a simple <b>phase</b> <b>array</b> receiver {{that can be used in}} communications, to steer a directional antenna electronically, to track radio tagged objects and in building VHF radar...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of ultrasonic <b>phased</b> <b>arrays</b> in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) is receiving {{more and more}} attention.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} several in-service {{applications for}} portable <b>phased</b> <b>arrays.</b> OmniScan is new category of instrument using ultrasonic <b>phased</b> <b>arrays,</b> {{as well as}} other technologies (conventional ultrasonics, TOFD, eddy current <b>arrays</b> etc.). Portable <b>phased</b> <b>arrays</b> can operate in manual, semi-automated (i. e. encoded) or fully automated modes, though most of the applications to date have been manual or semi-automated. Unlike conventional ultrasonics, portable <b>phased</b> <b>arrays</b> can provide many different displays, such as A-, B-, C-, D- and S-scans, plus combined displays which significantly help imaging. Most of the new applications so far have been specials, which take advantage of {{one or more of the}} following features: special scan patterns (e. g. S-scans), imaging (e. g. corrosion mapping or weld inspections), inspection speed, restricted space. Portable <b>phased</b> <b>arrays</b> also offer advanced reporting capability, including pre-prepared reports and automatic pasting of images into reports for archiving. Sample applications for portable <b>phased</b> <b>arrays</b> include: • Detection and sizing of SCC in turbine roots • Small diameter austenitic pipe weld inspections • In-service inspection of pipe for SCC • Butt weld inspections • T-weld inspections of bridge structures • HIC – Hydrogen Induced Cracking • Flange corrosion under gasket • Nozzle inspections • Thread inspections • Bridge bolt inspections • Spindle/shaft inspections • Landing gear inspections • Laser weld inspections • Composite...|$|R

25|$|As {{the price}} of {{electronics}} has fallen, <b>phased</b> <b>array</b> radars have become more common. Almost all modern military radar systems are based on phased arrays, where the small additional cost is offset by the improved reliability of a system with no moving parts. Traditional moving-antenna designs are still widely used in roles where cost is a significant factor such as air traffic surveillance and similar systems.|$|E
25|$|As the {{oscillation}} {{takes some}} time to set up, and is inherently random at the start, subsequent startups will have different output parameters. Phase is almost never preserved, which makes the magnetron difficult to use in <b>phased</b> <b>array</b> systems. Frequency also drifts from pulse to pulse, a more difficult problem for a wider array of radar systems. Neither of these present a problem for continuous-wave radars, nor for microwave ovens.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- <b>Phased</b> <b>arrays</b> offer major {{advantages}} over conventional radiographic inspection of welds: no radiation hazard, chemical disposal or licensing requirements; no disruption of production; near real-time inspection results, plus vertical defect sizing for Engineering Critical Assessment. In comparison with conventional ultrasonics, <b>phased</b> <b>arrays</b> are significantly faster, more flexible, reproducible, {{and can be}} tailored to the application. Overall, {{there is a strong}} interest in <b>phased</b> <b>arrays,</b> especially now that units are competitively priced and software is robust. However, the codes are not as advanced as the technology, as expected. In general, the codes accept <b>phased</b> <b>arrays</b> as a valid technology, but say little on the technique or procedures.

25|$|In October 1994, Raytheon paid $4 {{million to}} settle a U.S. {{government}} claim that it inflated a defense contract for antimissile radar.

30|$|The main {{advantage}} of <b>phased</b> <b>arrays</b> is its capability to construct nearly arbitrary far-field pattern. This character is attained by well tuning of the amplitude and phase features of aperture. It is realized by phase shifters and attenuators of all radiators. Although <b>phased</b> <b>arrays</b> has such kind characteristics, {{it is difficult}} to attain a satisfying far-field pattern; it is also hard if such pattern is reachable with a given aperture [19]. Thus, metaheuristic approaches are suitable to deal with this kind of problems. Although convergence to global optimum could not be guaranteed by metaheuristic approaches, they can find promising solutions given a fixed-cost condition. This paper attempts to tackle synthesis of <b>phased</b> <b>arrays</b> based on a recently proposed paradigm—artificial bee colony (ABC).|$|R
