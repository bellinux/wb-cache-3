60|$|The <b>preventive</b> <b>check</b> {{appears to}} operate in some degree through all the ranks of society in England.

60|$|In {{examining}} the principal states of modern Europe, we shall find that {{though they have}} increased very considerably in population since they were nations of shepherds, yet that at present their progress is but slow, and instead of doubling their numbers every twenty-five years they require three or four hundred years, or more, for that purpose. Some, indeed, may be absolutely stationary, and others even retrograde. The cause of this slow progress in population cannot be traced to a decay of the passion between the sexes. We have sufficient {{reason to think that}} this natural propensity exists still in undiminished vigour. Why then do not its effects appear in a rapid increase of the human species? An intimate view of the state of society in any one country in Europe, which may serve equally for all, will enable us to answer this question, and to say that a foresight of the difficulties attending the rearing of a family acts as a <b>preventive</b> <b>check,</b> and the actual distresses of some of the lower classes, by which they are disabled from giving the proper food and attention to their children, act as a positive check to the natural increase of population.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{tests for}} “Malthusian ” {{relationships}} (preventive and positive checks, and diminishing returns to labour) in preindustrial Northern Italy using data for 1650 - 1799. We {{do this by}} estimating a cointegrated VAR model on time series of real wages, and crude birth, death and marriage rates for 1650 - 1799. Our results suggest several clear conclusions. Fertility depends positively on nuptiality, but neither variable depends on income. We do not therefore find any evidence for the Malthusian <b>preventive</b> <b>check.</b> Neither is there evidence for the positive check. A larger population does, however, imply lower real wages, suggesting that diminishing returns are present. However, real wages are also subject to a very significant negative trend over time. The lack of <b>preventive</b> <b>check</b> {{seems to be the}} result of societal norms specific to Italy, i. e. that marriage did not depend on the establishment of a separate household, thus removing the income restraint on marriage (and thus fertility). The negative time trend in real wages is probably related to developments in the agricultural sector: principally a deterioration in the weather. Using recursive estimation techniques, we investigate how the relationships change after 1799 (until 1881). They remain remarkably stable, with the exception of the trend in real wages, which becomes insignificant. We contrast our results with those found using an identical methodology for England...|$|E
40|$|Background: Employees are {{increasingly}} provided with <b>preventive</b> health <b>checks.</b> However, participation rates are low and several ethical issues arise, {{such as a}} potential perceived threat to autonomy and privacy. Aims: To assess what employees think about <b>preventive</b> health <b>checks</b> in the occupational setting. Methods: Samples of construction workers and the general working population in the Netherlands completed a survey about <b>preventive</b> health <b>checks</b> in the occupational setting. We asked half of each sample about potential benefits and drawbacks of health checks, {{and the other half}} about how they should be offered. We employed explorative factor analysis to identify constructs related to perceived benefits and drawbacks, and the way health checks should be provided. We then conducted descriptive analyses and t-tests to compare subgroups of respondents. Results: A total of 482 (27 %) of construction workers and 738 (65 %) employees from the general population responded. The overall survey response rate was 42 % with 41 % completing the first questionnaire and 42 % the second. We identified three constructs related to perceived benefits and drawbacks: self-control over health, disturbance and negative emotion and lack of autonomy. Participants rated 'self-control over health' as the highest potential benefit (mean = 3. 40; SD = 0. 69), and 'your employer interfering in your personal life' as the most important potential drawback (mean = 3. 27; SD = 1. 00).

I estimated a vector autoregression for data on fertility, nuptiality, mortality and real wages over the period 1541 - 1840 applying a well-known identification strategy broadly used in macroeconomics. The results show that endogenous adjustment of population to real wages functioned as Malthus assumed only until the 17 th century: positive checks disappeared during the 17 th century and <b>preventive</b> <b>checks</b> disappeared before 1740.

40|$|Abstract Background Systematic <b>preventive</b> health <b>checks</b> {{in primary}} care have been {{introduced}} in several countries. The Danish Health Service does not provide this service, but health checks are nevertheless being conducted unsystematically. Very {{little is known about}} the GPs’ experience with this service. The purpose of our study is to describe GPs’ attitudes towards and concerns about providing <b>preventive</b> health <b>checks</b> and to describe their experiences with the health checks that they provide in daily practice. Methods A qualitative descriptive study was conducted based on three semi-structured focus group interviews with 16 GPs from Central Region, Denmark. The focus group interviews took place at the Department of Public Health, Section for General Practice, Aarhus University in November 2010. Results We found that the participating GPs all conducted some kind of <b>preventive</b> health <b>checks,</b> but also that there was great diversity in the content. The GPs were somewhat ambivalent towards health checks. Many GPs found the service beneficial for the patients. Concurrently, they had reservations about promoting ill-health, they questioned whether the health checks were a core mission of primary care, and they were concerned whether the health checks would benefit the “right” patients. The GPs felt a need for further documentation of the benefits for the patients before a possible future implementation of systematic health checks. Some GPs found that health checks could be performed in other settings than general practice. Conclusions Our study revealed that health checks are performed differently. Their quality differs, and the GPs perform the health check based on their personal attitude towards this service and prevention in general. Our analysis suggests that the doctors are basically uncertain about the best approach. Our study also uncovers the GPs’ reservations about inducing negative psychological reactions and decreased well-being among the health check participants. Further studies are needed to disclose where these concerns emerge. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Using {{longitudinal}} data this work analyses historical fertility between 1834 and 1914 in an Alpine village situated in north-east Italy, characterised by scarce resources and by an economy which passed from being traditional {{and based on}} closed subsistence to becoming open and integrated. During the initial period studied, this territory {{can be described as}} a natural fertility context, where Malthusian <b>preventive</b> <b>checks</b> were long-run mechanisms adopted to overcome the limitations set by the environment. In later years, seasonal migration started to play a predominant role in the community. These flows involved the best skilled, wealthiest and healthiest males and the countries of destination were more modern and affluent, offered better labour opportunities and salaries and possibilities of qualification. Impacts on fertility were strong, evidencing a smaller number of births for migrants, which partly resulted from a reduced childbearing period, with a later start and an earlier stop. The findings of this work therefore show that due to the positive selectivity of these men and to the exposure to influences during their periods of absence, in this village seasonal migrants were the agents of change and also the vanguard of modern reproductive behaviours...|$|R
40|$|Going by ideological debates {{concerning}} (un) justifiable state intervention, {{protection of}} individual liberty, {{and the question}} of state's role, this article analyses Malthus's theory on population. It states a thesis that theory on population leads Malthus toward the idea of a minimal state and represents a basis for criticism of an interventionist state and its paternalistic role. The article consists of an introduction, four sections and a conclusion. The introduction cites goals of the work and gives basic notes on Malthus's theory on population and its socio-historical context. Special consideration is paid on reasons that lead to desertion of his ideas with a special focus on changes within liberal ideology, that lead to dissociation from classical liberalism and a merging of liberalism with socialism. The first part examines basic principles of Malthus's theory on population - primarily the idea that the population multiply faster than the food supply, and that population, when unchecked, increases in geometrical ratio, while subsistence increases only in arithmetical ratio. Afterwards, this Malthus's idea is linked to the status of the poor, and is concluded that the state intervention is useless, being that the troubles this part of the population faces are a consequence of their own actions. Therefore, {{the role of the state}} should not be care for the poor. In the second part positive and <b>preventive</b> <b>checks</b> to population are examined. <b>Preventive</b> <b>checks</b> are further analyzed because Malthus gives them more importance. The third, central part, is dedicated to Malthus's criticism of the Poor Laws and, within it, his opposition to the state's intervention is further analyzed. According to Malthus, laws that are passed in order to improve the status of the poor have an opposite effect. Even though their aim is to decrease poverty, they increase it. Their tendency is to lead to an increase in population, without the simultaneous increase in food resources that are needed to satisfy the needs of that number of people. The poor, when given an increase in wages, tend to marry more and form families with a larger number of children that they can't support themselves. In that way, they become more dependent on the state, and this leads to an increase in poverty. The fourth part analyzes the misgivings of Malthus's theory, especially its negligence of technological advancement. And it is because of this omission that Malthus couldn't come to a different theory concerning population growth, rather than the one that he had formed. Finally, after all the important elements of Malthus's theory on population are analyzed, the importance of his thought and a theory of minimal state are examined. Stated and defended is the stance that the theory of minimal state is not value-neutral, and that the only minimal state that can exist is a liberal minimal state, and therefore Thomas Robert Malthus belongs to that tradition within the liberal thought...|$|R

The results of both cointegrated VAR and short-run analysis grant a reading where departure from the Malthusian world (if there ever was one) is due to a secular change in the relationship between income, marriages, and births.

40|$|Background and objective: Implementing {{preventive}} {{health care}} for young children provides {{the best chance of}} improving health and changing a child's life course. In Australia, despite government support for preventive health care, uptake of preventive services for young children is low. Using Andersen's behavioural model of health-care utilization, we aimed to understand how parents conceptualized their children's preventive health care and how this impacted on access to preventive health-care services. Design: Semi-structured telephone interviews conducted between May and July 2011. Setting and participants: Twenty-eight parents of children aged 3 - 5 years from three diverse socio-economic areas of Melbourne, Australia. Results: Thematic analysis showed parents' access to child preventive health care was determined by birth order of their child, cultural health beliefs, personal health practices, relationship with the health provider and the costs associated with health services. Parents with more than one child placed their own experience ahead of professional expertise, and their younger children were less likely to complete routine <b>preventive</b> health <b>checks.</b> Concerns around developmental delays required validation through family, friends and childcare organizations before presentation to health services. Conclusions: To improve child preventive health requires increased flexibility of services, strengthening of inter-professional relationships and enhancement of parents' knowledge about the importance of preventive health in early childhood. Policies that encourage continuity of care and remove point of service costs will further reduce barriers to preventive care for young children. Recent reforms in Australia's primary health care and the expansion of child <b>preventive</b> health <b>checks</b> into general practice present a timely opportunity for this to occur...|$|R
