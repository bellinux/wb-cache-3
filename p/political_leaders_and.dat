5|$|Historical {{coats of}} {{arms of the}} U.S. states {{date back to the}} {{admission}} of the first states to the Union. Despite the widely accepted practice of determining early statehood from the date of ratification of the United States Constitution, many of the original colonies referred to themselves as states shortly after the Declaration of Independence was signed on 4 July 1776. Committees of <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> intellectuals were established by state legislatures to research and propose a seal and coat of arms. Many of these members were signers of the Articles of Confederation, Declaration of Independence, and United States Constitution. Several of the earliest adopted state coats of arms and seals were similar or identical to their colonial counterparts.|$|E

5|$|The Saudi Arabia women's {{national}} football {{team would be}} the national team representing the kingdom in inter{{national football}}. However, the team does not yet exist because of influence of religious leaders in Saudi Arabia, systematic discrimination against women's sport, and active opposition of <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> sport administrators. International pressure has come {{to bear on the}} country to field a women's team, and FIFA now allows the hijab to be worn in competition. A meeting at the College of Business Administration in Jeddah was seen as a possible first step in a team eventually being created.|$|E
5|$|The {{names of}} Florida's {{counties}} reflect its diverse cultural heritage. Some are named for Confederate <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> Spanish explorers, marking {{the influence of}} Spanish sovereignty, while others are named for Spanish saints, Native American placenames used by the Spanish, and political leaders of the United States. Natural features of the region, including rivers, lakes, and flora, are also commonly used for county names. Florida has counties named for participants {{on both sides of}} Second Seminole War: Miami-Dade County is partially named for Francis L. Dade, a Major in the U.S. Army at the time; Osceola County is named for a Native American resistance leader during the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} festivities {{take place}} in Islamabad and commence with the raising of the national flag on the Parliament House and the Presidency followed by a 31-gun salute in the capital and a 21-gun salute in provincial capitals. The President and Prime Minister of Pakistan address the nation in live telecasts. Government officials, <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> celebrities deliver messages or speeches during rallies, ceremonies and events, highlighting Pakistani achievements, goals set for the future, and praise the sacrifices and efforts of national heroes. Government buildings including the Parliament House, Supreme Court, President House and Prime Minister's Secretariat are decorated and illuminated with lights and bright colours.
