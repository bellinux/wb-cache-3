5|$|The U.S. State Department, after {{closing the}} NTSB {{investigation}} {{on the grounds}} that it was not an accident, pursued an ICAO investigation instead. Commentators such as Johnson <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> action was illegal, and that in deferring the investigation to the ICAO, the Reagan administration effectively precluded any politically or militarily sensitive information from being subpoenaed that might have embarrassed the administration or contradicted its version of events. Unlike the NTSB, ICAO can subpoena neither persons nor documents and is dependent on the governments involved—in this incident, the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, and South Korea—to supply evidence voluntarily.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the input statistics, Croatian NGOs GONG and Transparency International Croatia have decided to hire a media analysis agency which calculated {{the amount of money}} that was necessarily spent on advertising on television, radio and print media. They <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is only the observable media spending, while they estimate actual cost to be in excess of twice the amount spent on the media.|$|E

25|$|One {{continuing}} controversy of {{the player}} selection process is the rule that each team has {{to have at least}} one representative on its league's All-Star roster. Supporters of the rule <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> prevents the large-market teams from totally dominating the squad, and keeps fan and media interest in the game, as fans would not be interested in the game if their team did not have any players involved. Opponents of the rule contend {{that the purpose of the}} game is to spotlight Major League Baseball's best players, and that some players from stronger teams are left off the roster in favor of possibly less deserving players from weaker teams.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the Ryūzōji clan {{was older}} than the Nabeshima clan in Hizen. After Ryūzōji Takanobu's death, his {{assistant}} Nabeshima Naoshige held the real power, and after {{the sudden death of}} Takanobu's grandchild Takafusa, his father Masaie also committed suicide. Afterwards, since the remnants of the Ryūzōji clan created disturbances in the public order near the Saga castle, Naoshige, in order to pacify the spirits of the Ryūzōji, built Tenyū-ji (now in Tafuse, Saga). This has been considered the origin of the disturbance and it is thought that the bakeneko was an expression of the Ryūzōji's grudge {{in the form of a}} cat. Also, the inheritance of power from the Ryūzōji clan to the Nabeshima clan was not an issue, but because of Takanobu's death, and Nabeshima Katsushige's son's sudden death, some <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> kaidan (ghost story) arose from a dramatization of this series of events.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. TV Squad's Michael Sciannamea gave the episode a largely positive review wrote that Michael is [...] "totally taken with himself", but still [...] "has shown us his vulnerabilities". Sciannamea noted that, by showing the audience Michael's humanity, the writers were making [...] "this sitcom so compelling". Sciannamea, however, did <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{is the second}} week in a row that [...] "Pam is offended by something Jim has said or done", which in his mind [...] "will get tiresome quickly if it continues". [...] "Miss Alli" [...] of Television Without Pity graded the episode with a [...] "B+". Rolling Stone named the scene wherein the employees read Threat Level: Midnight as the tenth funniest in The Office's first three seasons.|$|E

500|$|Itzam K'an Ahk II, {{also known}} as Ruler 4, was born on November 18, 701 AD (9.13.9.14.15 7 Men 18 K'ank'in [...] in the Long Count). Of the three extant {{references}} to Itzam K'an Ahk's birth, {{not a single one}} mentions his pedigree or parentage, suggesting that Itzam K'an Ahk was not a direct descendant of his predecessor, K'inich Yo'nal Ahk II. Despite this, Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube point out that in one portrait, the ajaw is shown with a turtle-headdressed belt ornament, suggesting that one of Itzam K'an Ahk's ancestors may have indeed had the word auk, or turtle, in their name, signifying royalty. With this being said, Stela 40—discussed later—shows what could be Itzam K'an Ahk's mother in Teotihuacano garb, suggesting that Itzam K'an Ahk was emphasizing potential connections to Teotihuacan, possibly the home of his mother. Martin and Grube also <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> stela was erected exactly 83 Tzolk'in, or about 59 years, following the death of Itzam K'an Ahk I, a former ajaw of Piedras Negras who lent his name to Itzam K'an Ahk II, insinuating some sort of [...] "special link" [...] between the two rulers.|$|E
500|$|The Jesuit critic William F. Lynch, who {{believed}} that salvation happens within time and not outside of it, explained what Eliot was attempting {{to do in the}} Four Quartets when he wrote: [...] "it is hard to say no to the impression, if I may use a mixture of my own symbols and his, that the Christian imagination is finally limited to the element of fire, to the day of Pentecost, to the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the disciples. The revelation of eternity and time is of an intersection ... It seems not unseemly to suppose that Eliot's imagination (and is this not a theology?) is alive with points of intersection and of descent." [...] He continued with a focus on how time operated within the poem: [...] "He seems to place our faith, our hope, and our love, not in the flux of time but in the points of time. I am sure his mind is interested in the line and time of Christ, whose Spirit is his total flux. But I am not so sure about his imagination. Is it or is it not an imagination which is saved from time's nausea or terror by points of intersection? ... There seems little doubt that Eliot is attracted above all by the image and the goal of immobility, and that in everything he seeks for approximations to this goal in the human order." [...] Lynch went on to <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> understanding of time includes Asian influences.|$|E

2500|$|Anyone is {{permitted}} to possess legally registered or captive-bred raptors, although falconers are anxious to <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is not synonymous with falconry, which specifically entails the hunting of live quarry with a trained bird. [...] A raptor kept merely as a pet or possession, although the law may allow it, is {{not considered to be}} a falconer's bird. Birds may be used for breeding or kept after their hunting days are over, but falconers believe it is preferable that young, fit birds are flown at quarry.|$|E

Various proposals have been offered to remedy this defect. A further criticism is that language doesn't work {{on the basis of}} reciprocal altruism anyway. Humans in conversational groups don't withhold information to all except listeners likely to offer valuable information in return. On the contrary, they seem to want to advertise to the world their access to socially relevant information, broadcasting it to anyone who will listen without thought of return.|$|E
