50|$|<b>Phenakite</b> {{is found}} in {{high-temperature}} pegmatite veins and in mica-schists associated with quartz, chrysoberyl, apatite and topaz. It {{has long been known}} from the emerald and chrysoberyl mine on the Takovaya stream, near Yekaterinburg in the Urals of Russia, where large crystals occur in mica-schist. It is also found with topaz and amazon-stone in the granite of the Ilmen Mountains in the southern Urals and of the Pikes Peak region in Colorado (US). Small, gem grade individual crystals of <b>phenakite</b> showing a prismatic habit are noted in beryl dissolution cavities at the Noumas II Pegmatite, part of the Orange River pegmatite belt in the Northern Cape of South Africa. Large crystals of prismatic habit have been found in a feldspar quarry at Kragero in Norway. Framont near Schirmeck in Alsace is another well-known locality. Still larger crystals, measuring 1 to 2 in. in diameter and weighing 28 lb. have been found at Greenwood in Maine, but these are pseudomorphs of quartz after <b>phenakite.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Phenakite</b> or {{phenacite}} is {{a fairly}} rare nesosilicate mineral consisting of beryllium orthosilicate, Be2SiO4. Occasionally used as a gemstone, <b>phenakite</b> occurs as isolated crystals, which are rhombohedral with parallel-faced hemihedrism, and are either lenticular or prismatic in habit: the lenticular habit {{is determined by the}} development of faces of several obtuse rhombohedra and the absence of prism faces. There is no cleavage, and the fracture is conchoidal. The Mohs hardness is high, being 7.5 - 8; the specific gravity is 2.96. The crystals are sometimes perfectly colorless and transparent, but more often they are greyish or yellowish and only translucent; occasionally they are pale rose-red. In general appearance the mineral is not unlike quartz, for which indeed it has been mistaken. It is used a gemstone. Its name comes from the Greek phenakos, meaning [...] "deceiver" [...] due to its close visual similarity to quartz.|$|E
50|$|There {{are seven}} major {{collecting}} areas within the Pikes Peak granite. All of the collecting areas {{have the same}} basic assemblage minerals, predominately consisting of smoky quartz crystals and amazonite, with topaz, <b>phenakite</b> and other rarer minerals in certain areas.

50|$|Thor Lake is {{a deposit}} of rare metals {{located in the}} Blachford Lake {{intrusive}} complex. It is situated 5 km north of the Hearne Channel of Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada, approximately 100 kilometers east-southeast of {{the capital city of}} Yellowknife. Geologically located on the Canadian Shield it is mostly composed of peralkaline syenite (granitic rock with low quartz content). The Blatchford Lake complex was created in the early Proterozoic, 2.14 Ga ago. The deposit is divided in several sub-structures. In a small zone at the northern edge of the syenite, the T-Zone, minerals like bastnäsite, <b>phenakite</b> and xenotime can be found.|$|E
50|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{beryllium}} were synthesised during the Big Bang, {{although most of}} it decayed or reacted further to create larger nuclei, like carbon, nitrogen or oxygen. Beryllium is a component of 100 out of 4000 known minerals, such as bertrandite, Be4Si2O7(OH)2, beryl, Al2Be3Si6O18, chrysoberyl, Al2BeO4, and <b>phenakite,</b> Be2SiO4. Precious forms of beryl are aquamarine, red beryl and emerald. The most common sources of beryllium used commercially are beryl and bertrandite and production of it involves the reduction of beryllium fluoride with magnesium metal or the electrolysis of molten beryllium chloride, containing some sodium chloride as beryllium chloride is a poor conductor of electricity.|$|E

40|$|In Galicia, in {{the northwestern}} part of the Iberian Peninsula, there are several occurrences of {{granitic}} pegmatites. One of them, known as Franqueira, is a metasomatic deposit of gem-quality chrysoberyl, emerald and <b>phenakite.</b> The pegmatite {{is associated with a}} two-mica peraluminous Hercynian granite, and intrude dunites of the Schistose domain in the Galician Tras-Os-Montes Zone. The composition of fluid inclusions in emerald and <b>phenakite</b> has been determined using a Raman microprobe to ascertain the paleofluid chemistry and the P–T conditions of fluid migration in the pegmatite. Three types of fluid inclusions have been identified in emerald and phenakite; three episodes of fluid circulation are distinguished. The first episode is represented by low-salinity aqueous-carbonic primary fluid inclusions in phenakite; these were trapped at 2. 5 kbar and 400 °C. An isothermal drop in pressure produced a second stage of fluid trapping under conditions of 400 °C and 1 kbar. Fluid inclusions trapped in emerald indicate that during this second stage, it formed from <b>phenakite</b> and chrysoberyl {{in the presence of a}} CO 2 - and CH 4 -rich fluid. A third episode of fluid circulation suggests an independent stage of fluid circulation during late tectonic events, with temperatures ranging from 160 ° to 265 °C and pressure below 0. 5 kbar...|$|E
40|$|Mineral {{incompatibilities}} (based on {{a complete}} review of natural occurrences), relevant experimental data, {{and a computer}} program ("REACTION") {{have been used to}} model the probable stabilities of beryllium-bearing minerals in the system CaO-BeO-SiO•-P 2 Os-F 20 _ 1, in terms of the chemical potentials of the Lewis acid components P 205 and F•O_I. The somewhat complicated phase relations are greatly simplified if it is assumed that the gangue minerals (in this case, mainly quartz plus fluorite, CaF•, or fluorapatite, Ca•(PO 4) aF) are present "in excess, " so that only one Be-ore mineral is stable in a given region of the 3 t•F•O_l [...] t•P•O • diagram. The resulting diagram shows that gugiaite, Ca•BeSi 207, and other Be-bearing calc-silicates in skarns, are stable only under relatively high temperature or basic conditions. With increasing activities of the acid components F•O_I and P•O•, <b>phenakite,</b> Be•SiO 4, becomes stable with fluorite or fluorapatite in typical greisen and vein assemblages (especially in replaced carbonate rocks). Under the very high P•O•, low F•O_i conditions characteristic of the late stages of certain pegmatites, hurlbutite, CaBe•(PO•) 2, becomes stable, whereas under high activities of both P•O 5 and F•O_I, herderite, CaBePO 4 F, becomes stable in very late-stage pegmatites and in greisens. Under conditions more F•O_l-rich than those normally encountered in nature, the phase CaBeF • might occur (especially in fluid inclusions). When AlcOa is added to the model system, the resulting diagrams show the break-down reactions of beryl, BeaA 12 Si 0 Oa 8, to <b>phenakite</b> plus topaz in the fluorite stability field, or to herderite plus topaz in the fluorapatite stability field...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{physical}} properties of and the chemical bonding in two classesof nitrides are {{studied in the}} framework of density functional theory(DFT). The phase diagram of the iron nitrides is very complex. Over a broad range of nitrogen concentrations they are ferromagnetic metals. The spin density is concentrated around the iron atoms and the value of the magnetic moment of the iron atom is characteristic of the number of nearest neighbour nitrogen atoms. A careful analysis of the results of a series of DFT calculations shows, that the strong covalent iron-nitrogen bond causes the characteristic dependence of the magnetic moment on the nitrogen environment. On the basis of this analysis a simple model is proposed, that correctly describes the decrease of the magnetic moment of the unit cell with increasing nitrogen concentration, that is found in the DFT calculations. However, close to the composition Fe_ 2 N the calculations (and the model as well) give a ferromagnetic ground state. In contrast to this, the experimental results rule out a ferromagnetic ground state. It seems, that current exchange and correlation functionals do not describe the electronic structure of the iron nitrides with the composition Fe_ 2 N. The strong iron-nitrogen bonding affects the nitrogen diffusionas well. The activation energy and the transition rate between adjacent interstitial sites were calculated for typical diffusion paths in the ferromagnetic phase of gamma-Fe_ 4 N and epsilon-Fe_ 3 N. In the paramagnetic phase the activation energies are significantly smaller, so that a higher transition rate can be expected. Possible links to the observed disorder of nitrogen in paramagnetic samples are discussed. The second class of nitrides studied are those of the composition A_ 3 N_ 4, where A in {Si, Ge, Sn}. The ground state structure of these insulators was determined by calculating the energy vs. volume curves for the compounds in the <b>phenakite</b> and the spinell structure. Whereas Si_ 3 N_ 4 and Ge_ 3 N_ 4 cristallize in the <b>phenakite</b> structure, the ground state structure of Sn_ 3 N_ 4 is the spinell structure. It is shown, that the chemical bond between the group IV element and nitrogenis of a mixed covalent-ionic type. The heavier the group IV element, the larger is the ionic contribution to the bond. Thus, for Sn_ 3 N_ 4 the close-packed spinell structure is energetically more favourable than the phenakit structure...|$|E
40|$|An exotic {{pegmatite}} {{classified as}} a rare-element gadolinite type amazonite pegmatite is situated in Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, and associated with the peralkaline ekerite granites in the Permian Oslo Region. The amazonite pegmatite is approximately 16 meters long and consists of a coarse-grained, subhedral, green microcline feldspar (amazonite), quartz and danalite. Fine grained fabric with abundant sulphides intersect the coarse grained amazonite several places, and indicates a second generation of mineralization. The danalite has a strong reddish color with an intermediate composition of zinc and iron, i. e. composition along the danalite – genthelvite solid-solution series. Abundant pristine subhedral to euhedral <b>phenakite</b> coexist with danalite, and a boron zone in the pegmatite interior contains abundant danburite, tourmaline, and minor nordenskiöldine. Additional löllingite, gadolinite-(Y), biotite, zircon, columbite-(Fe), pyrochlore group minerals, and fluorite occur throughout the pegmatite body. Other pegmatites in the area contain primarily amphibole, pyroxene, microcline, and quartz. Major element variation of the amazonite pegmatite and its neighbor pegmatites correlate; however, trace-element evolution trends diverge in respect to REE, Nb, Y, and Ta. The amazonite pegmatite is clearly enriched in HREE relative to LREE, while Y, Nb, and Ta contents are significantly higher in the amazonite pegmatite than other pegmatites in the area. This evidence, {{in conjunction with the}} high boron- and sulphur-content, indicates an enrichment of the original NYF magma by circulating hydrothermal fluids, and chemical exchange with the sedimentary wall-rocks...|$|E
40|$|A Be- 9 -solution {{has been}} {{chemically}} prepared from <b>phenakite</b> (Be 2 SiO 4) mineral grains as commercial Be- 9 -solutions {{are too high}} in long-lived Be- 10. The solution {{is intended to be}} used as a carrier for radiochemical separation of Be- 10 to be measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Thus, accurate data of the Be- 9 -concentration of this solution is essential to guarantee for high-accuracy Be- 10 data in the future. After devastating preliminary results (similar to 8 % standard deviation), eight laboratories finally produced twelve individual results by four different analytical methods. A certain lab and method bias might be identified by sophisticated statistical evaluation. Some laboratories also (grossly) underestimate their uncertainties. Thus, the simple weighted mean of this round-robin exercise needed to be corrected by introducing additional allowances (Paule-Mandel-approach). The final result has been calculated to (2, 246 +/- A 11) mu g Be- 9 /(g solution) with a reasonably low weighted standard deviation of 0. 49 %. The maximum deviation of a single lab value from the weighted mean is 2. 4 % when removing one Grubbs outlier (11 % off from the mean) from the data set. As Be- 10 -data, which is usually calculated from measured Be- 10 /Be- 9 by AMS and stable Be- 9, cannot be more accurate than the determined Be- 9 -concentration, it seems highly advisable to establish or improve quality assurance by having self-made carrier-solutions analysed at more than a single lab and regularly taking part in round-robin exercises...|$|E
40|$|The Ianapera emerald deposit {{is located}} in the Neoproterozoic Vohibory Block of {{southern}} Madagascar. The local geology consists of intercalated migmatitic gneissic units and calcareous metasedimentary rocks, containing boudinaged metamorphosed mafic/ultramafic lenses, all intruded by pegmatite veins. These units occur near the hinge of the tightly folded Ianapera antiform, within a few kilometers of the Ampanihy shear zone. Emerald mineralization is hosted by metasomatic phlogopite veins, and bodies developed within the mafic/ultramafic rocks. Based on field and textural relationships, we distinguish proximal and distal styles of mineralization. Proximal mineralization occurs at the contact of pegmatite veins with mafic/ultramafic units; in the distal style, pegmatites are not observed. Three types of emeralds could be distinguished, mainly on the basis of color and mineral zoning. Some of these emeralds have the most Al-depleted and Cr-rich composition ever recorded. Another characteristic feature to the Ianapera deposit and, to our knowledge, yet unreported, is the association of some emeralds with scapolite in metasomatised mafic rocks. Mineral inclusions are common in most emeralds and include phlogopite, carbonates, barite, K-feldspar, quartz, pyrite, zircon, monazite, bastnaesite, <b>phenakite,</b> plus Fe and Cr oxides. However, feldspar and rare earth element-bearing minerals occur predominantly in proximal emeralds, which also have a more incompatible trace-element signature than distal emeralds. We propose a model related to syn- to post-tectonic magmatic-hydrothermal activity. Pegmatitic bodies intruded units of the Ianapera antiform probably during tectonic relaxation. Exsolution of fluids rich in halogens and incompatible elements from the cooling pegmatites caused hydrothermal metasomatism of Cr-bearing mafic/ultramafic rocks in direct contact with the pegmatites. Local fracturing favored fluid infiltration, permitting the formation of distal mineralization. Emerald composition was controlled by the chemistry of the host rock. The presence of carbonate mineral inclusions in the emeralds and the high F-activity indicated by elevated F-contents in newly formed minerals suggest transport of Be as a fluoride-carbonate complex. It seems likely that beryl formation was triggered by precipitation of F-rich phlogopite, which removed the complexing ligand from the fluid...|$|E
