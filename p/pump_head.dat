50|$|Most {{metering}} pumps have a <b>pump</b> <b>head</b> and a motor. The liquid being pumped {{goes through the}} <b>pump</b> <b>head,</b> entering through an inlet line and leaving through an outlet line. The motor is commonly an electric motor which drives the <b>pump</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Liquids {{are only}} very {{slightly}} compressible. This property of liquids lets metering pumps discharge liquids at high pressure. Since a liquid can be only slightly compressed during a discharge stroke, it is {{forced out of}} the <b>pump</b> <b>head.</b> Gases are much more compressible. Metering pumps are not good at pumping gases. Sometimes, a metering or similar pump has to be primed before operation, i. e. the <b>pump</b> <b>head</b> filled with the liquid to be pumped. When gas bubbles enter a <b>pump</b> <b>head,</b> the compression motion compresses the gas but has a hard time forcing it out of the <b>pump</b> <b>head.</b> The pump may stop pumping liquid with gas bubbles in the <b>pump</b> <b>head</b> even though mechanically the pump is going through the motions, repeatedly compressing and decompressing the bubbles. To prevent this type of [...] "vapor lock", chromatography solvents are often degassed before pumping.|$|E

50|$|Check valves {{are often}} used with some types of pumps. Piston-driven and {{diaphragm}} pumps such as metering pumps and pumps for chromatography commonly use inlet and outlet ball check valves. These valves often look like small cylinders attached to the <b>pump</b> <b>head</b> on the inlet and outlet lines. Many similar pump-like mechanisms for moving volumes of fluids around use check valves such as ball check valves. The feed pumps or injectors which supply water to steam boilers are fitted with check valves to prevent back-flow.|$|E
50|$|A single-piston pump {{delivers}} {{liquid to}} the outlet {{only during the}} discharge stroke. If the piston's suction and discharge strokes occur {{at the same speed}} and liquid is metered out half the time the pump is working, then the overall metering rate averaged over time equals half the average flow rate during the discharge stroke. Some single-piston pumps may have a constant slow piston motion for discharge and a quick retract motion for refilling the <b>pump</b> <b>head.</b> In such cases, the overall metering rate is practically equal to the pumping rate during the discharge stroke.|$|E
50|$|Many CPB {{circuits}} now {{employ a}} centrifugal pump {{for the maintenance}} and control of blood flow during CPB. By altering the speed of revolution (RPM) of the <b>pump</b> <b>head,</b> blood flow is produced by centrifugal force. This type of pumping action {{is considered to be}} superior to the action of the roller pump by many because it is thought to produce less blood damage (hemolysis, etc.), but mostly due to the centrifugal pump being pressure limited, therefore less likely to rupture the system if a sudden occlusion occurs on the high-pressure line system.|$|E

5000|$|This {{project is}} also called Dummugudem to Sagar tail pond lift canal project. The canal starts from Dummugudem pond at [...] to Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond located across the Krishna River. This lift canal is an inter river basin {{transfer}} link by feeding Godavari river {{water from the}} Dummugudem pond to Krishna river basin {{to the extent of}} 165 tmcft.

50|$|Pumps used in {{high-pressure}} chromatography such as HPLC and {{ion chromatography}} are much like small piston metering pumps. For wear resistance and chemical resistance to solvents, etc., typically the pistons {{are made of}} artificial sapphire and the ball check valves have ruby balls and sapphire seats. To produce good chromatograms, it is desirable to have a pumping flow rate as constant as possible. Either a single piston pump with a quick refill is used or a double <b>pump</b> <b>head</b> with coordinated piston strokes is used to provide as constant a pumping rate as possible.|$|E
50|$|Serious {{problems}} with the engine led to a redesign for 1976-1977.

Warranty was upgraded to five years or 60000 mi.

50|$|If the {{pressure}} at the outlet {{is lower than}} {{the pressure}} at the inlet and remains that way in spite of the pumping, then this pressure difference opens both check valves simultaneously and the liquid flows through the <b>pump</b> <b>head</b> uncontrollably from inlet to outlet. This can happen whether the pump is working or not. This situation can be avoided by placing a correctly rated positive pressure differential check valve downstream of the pump. Such a valve will only open if a minimum rated pressure differential across the valve is exceeded, something which most high-pressure metering pumps can easily exceed.|$|E

40|$|A {{rotary phase}} {{separator}} system generally includes a step-shaped rotary drum separator (RDS) and a motor assembly. The aspect {{ratio of the}} stepped drum minimizes power for both the accumulating and pumping functions. The accumulator section of the RDS has a relatively small diameter to minimize power losses within an axial length to define significant volume for accumulation. The pumping section of the RDS has a larger diameter to increase <b>pumping</b> <b>head</b> but has a shorter axial length to minimize power losses.

50|$|The {{two-phase}} fluid (water and steam) above the core enters the riser area, {{which is the}} upper region contained inside of the shroud. The height of this region may be increased to increase the thermal natural recirculation <b>pumping</b> <b>head.</b> At {{the top of the}} riser area is the moisture separator. By swirling the two-phase flow in cyclone separators, the steam is separated and rises upwards towards the steam dryer while the water remains behind and flows horizontally out into the downcomer or annulus region. In the downcomer or annulus region, it combines with the feedwater flow and the cycle repeats.|$|R
50|$|The {{performance}} characteristics of an {{axial flow pump}} {{is shown in the}} figure. As shown in the figure, the head at the zero flow rate can be as much as three times the head at the pump’s best efficiency point. Also, the power requirement increases as the flow decreases, with the highest power drawn at the zero flow rate. This characteristic is opposite to that of a radial flow centrifugal pump where power requirement increases with an increase in the flow. Also the power requirements and <b>pump</b> <b>head</b> increases with an increase in pitch, thus allowing the pump to adjust according to the system conditions to provide the most efficient operation.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} avoid leakage at the packing or seal {{particularly}} when a liquid is dangerous, toxic, or noxious, diaphragm pumps are used for metering. Diaphragm pumps have a diaphragm through which repeated compression/decompression motion is transmitted. The liquid does not penetrate through the diaphragm, so the liquid inside the pump is sealed off from the outside. Such motion changes the volume of a chamber in the <b>pump</b> <b>head</b> so that liquid enters through an inlet check valve during decompression and exits through an outlet check valve during compression, {{in a manner similar}} to piston pumps. Diaphragm pumps can also be made which discharge at fairly high pressure. Diaphragm metering pumps are commonly hydraulically driven.|$|E
5000|$|Piston-driven {{metering}} pumps commonly work as follows: There is a piston (sometimes called plunger), typically cylindrical, which {{can go in}} and out of a correspondingly shaped chamber in the <b>pump</b> <b>head.</b> The inlet and outlet lines are joined to the piston chamber. There are two check valves, often ball check valves, attached to the <b>pump</b> <b>head,</b> one at the inlet line and the other at the outlet line. The inlet valve allows flow from the inlet line to the piston chamber, but not in the reverse direction. The outlet valve allows flow from the chamber to the outlet line, but not in reverse. The motor repeatedly moves the piston into and out of the piston chamber, causing the volume of the chamber to repeatedly become smaller and larger. When the piston moves out, a vacuum is created. Low pressure in the chamber causes liquid to enter and fill the chamber through the inlet check valve, but higher pressure at the outlet causes the outlet valve to shut. Then when the piston moves in, it pressurizes the liquid in the chamber. High pressure in the chamber causes the inlet valve to shut and forces the outlet valve to open, forcing liquid out at the outlet. These alternating suction and discharge strokes are repeated over and over to meter the liquid. In back of the chamber, there is packing around the piston or a doughnut-shaped seal with a toroid-shaped sphincter-like spring inside compressing the seal around the piston. This holds the fluid pressure when the piston slides in and out and makes the pump leak-tight. The packing or seals can wear out after prolonged use and can be replaced. The metering rate can be adjusted by varying the strokelength by which the piston moves back and forth or varying the speed of the piston motion.|$|E

Experimental results for this technology are presented based on a prototype. The economic viability of the system was assessed based on solar radiation data of different Nepalese geographic locations. The mechanical power produced by the solar ORC is coupled with a water pumping system for various applications, such as drinking and irrigation. The thermal efficiency of the system was found to be 8 % with an operating temperature of 120 °C. The hot water produced by the unit has a temperature of 40 °C. Economic assessment was done for 1 -kW and 5 -kW solar ORC water pumping systems. These systems use different types of solar collectors: a parabolic trough collector (PTC) and an evacuated tube collector (ETC).
