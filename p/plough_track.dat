40|$|Effects of {{seafloor}} disturbance on sediment biogeochemistry {{have been}} studied in the DISCOL Experimental Area (DEA) during leg SO 242 - 1 and 242 - 2 of RV SONNE (Aug. /Sep. 2015). A variety of approaches have been employed including investigations in retrieved sediment cores (solid phase and pore water geochemistry, shipboard oxygen microprofiles) as well as lander- and ROV-based in situ flux studies with micro sensors and benthic chambers. Several levels of disturbance and spatiotemporal scales were addressed: Types of Disturbances included disruption of sediments as well as removal of sediments and nodules. Comparisons were carried out between distant sites of contrasting disturbance level (<b>plough</b> <b>track</b> vs. reference area off DEA) {{as well as between}} microhabitats identified within disturbed areas (e. g., elevations, depressions, excavated subsurface layers). Post-disturbance time scales that were addressed ranged from minutes (experimental nodule removal by ROV) and weeks (Epibenthos sledge deployments during the first leg) to years (plough harrow tows during the original disturbance experiment in 1989). This contribution introduces the habitats studied and the methods employed to investigate disturbance effects. Furthermore, first results on biogeochemical zonations and interfacial fluxes are presented and discussed with regard to predictions based on geochemical models...|$|E

The results from the Plynlimon studies are placed {{in the context of the}} observed impacts of particular forest practices and studies of forestry effects on sediment transport elsewhere in the world. The effects associated with drain excavation, <b>ploughing,</b> <b>track</b> construction, ground and channel disruption are outlined for both bedload and, particularly, for suspended load. Finally, recent data on sediment yields from 1995 to 1997 at Plynlimon are reported and discussed in the light of longer-term sediment yield estimates.

40|$|The {{scientific}} work during SO 242 / 2 (28. August - 01. October 2015) {{was part of}} the JPIO Pilot Action ‘Ecological Aspects of Deep-Sea Mining‘. The main goal was to study the potential long-term ecological impact of anthropogenic disturbances on the deep-sea floor from mining polymetallic Mn-nodules. The expedition SO 242 built on studies of the former German TUSCH projects (1989 - 1996) with four RV SONNE cruises to the DISCOL Experimental Area in the Peru Basin, South Pacific (7 °S, 88. 5 ° W; 4150 m water depth) between 1989 and 1996 (DISCOL and ATESEPP projects). The integrated ecological studies were carried out within and next to <b>plough</b> <b>tracks</b> of the original DISCOL experiment 1989, which mimicked seafloor disturbances similar to those occurring during nodule mining. Leg 242 / 2 extended the investigations started during leg 242 / 1 with a focus on biogeochemical and biological sampling and observations, including comparative studies of the composition of benthic communities (all size classes) as well as of ecosystem functions (remineralization rates, transfer of matter and energy in food webs, ecotoxicology). In addition, observations were continued of the physicochemical characteristics of the DEA, including the overlying benthic boundary layer. The nodule fields surrounding the DEA were used as references for undisturbed areas. A large proportion of the work was based on autonomous instruments and sensor modules that were deployed by means of ROV and lander systems. In addition, ROV-manipulated and telemetryguided instruments such as the Ocean Floor Observatory System were used for targeted sampling and surveys. Food-web experiments including some small-scale disturbances were carried out and sampled directly at the seafloor by the ROV...|$|R
5000|$|Donbass is {{dominated}} by heavy industry, such as coal mining and metallurgy. While annual extraction of coal has decreased since the 1970s, Donbass remains an important supplier. Coal mining in Donbass is conducted at very deep depths. Lignite mining takes place at around 600 m below the surface, whilst mining for more valuable anthracite and bituminous coal takes place at depths of around 1800 m. Prior {{to the start of}} the region's war in April 2014, Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts together produced about 30 percent of Ukraine's exports. [...] Other industries in Donetsk which may overlap Donbass include blast-furnace and steel-making equipment, railway freight cars, metal-cutting machine-tools, tunneling machines, agricultural harvesters and <b>ploughing</b> systems, railway <b>tracks,</b> mining cars, electric locomotives, military vehicles, tractors and excavators. The region also produces consumer goods like household washing-machines, refrigerators, freezers, TV sets, leather footwear, and toilet soap. Over half its production is exported, and about 22% is exported to Russia.|$|R
40|$|Cruise SO 242 / 1 {{ran from}} 28 July to 25 August 2015 {{starting}} and ending in Guayaquil, Ecuador. In total, 40 scientists from five European countries {{took part in}} this cruise of the JPIO project ‚Ecological Aspects of Deep‐Sea Mining‘ to study the ecological long‐term impact of deep sea disturbances. The working area, the DISCOL area in the Peru Basin, was ploughed in 1989 and thoroughly studied in the years thereafter, the last cruise, SO 106, happened in 1996. SO 242 / 2 aimed at mapping the DISCOL Experimental Area (DEA) in great detail using ship‐based and AUV‐based hydroacoustic and optical methods. To see changes between differently disturbed areas and study the possible recovery of the ecosystem, biological sampling occurred with TV‐guided multi‐coring (MUC), box coring (BC) and epi‐benthic sledge tracks (EBS). Additional biological sampling for scavenging animals occurred with baited Amphipod‐Traps within and further outside the DEA. For geochemical sampling, multi‐, box and gravity coring (BC) was used. Two lander systems equipped with physical sensors such as ADCPs and CTDs were used for current measurements and to monitor sediment plume dispersal created by the EBS. Additional visual studies of the fauna distribution occurred with camera tows (OFOS). Five main sampling areas were selected, two within the DEA targeting heavily disturbed (ploughed) locations and three reference areas 3 to 4 nmi outside the DEA. All five areas had been sampled {{in the past and}} can be directly compared concerning ecological changes. Despite a four‐day break due to medical reasons the work program could almost be completed. Four of the working areas were at least sampled with five BCs and MUCs each, and one GC. Box coring could not be performed in the western reference area. In total, 5 CTDs, 27 MUCs, 25 BCs, 7 GCs, 8 EBSs, 5 Amphipod‐Traps, 6 lander deployments and 6 OFOS tracks were successfully undertaken and one thermistor mooring was deployed. In addition, 16 AUV dives clearly showed that plough marks are still well visible after 26 years. There is a slight sediment cover next to the <b>plough</b> <b>tracks,</b> but first analyses of the faunal distribution show that the sessile fauna has not yet recolonised the tracks. Stalked sponges, corals and anemones can be found outside the tracks but still within the DEA. Their distribution patterns inside the DEA do not vary clearly from those on reference sites. The Mn‐nodule distribution is not homogenous; there are areas inside the DEA that do not have nodules at the seafloor surface; they are typically linked to depressions that show low backscatter intensity in the AUV side scan sonar data pointing towards less dense sediment infill. In gravity cores, nodules could be recovered even in 9 m sediment depth, finding several more or less intact nodules throughout the entire sediment column was common. Water current measurements show slow currents (max. 6 cm/s) and a strong tide‐influenced current direction, whereas no general direction could be observed. Two ‘disturbance experiments’ demonstrated that sediment plumes can be monitored using high frequency ADCPs (1200 kHz). The disturbance by the EBS created a sediment plume that stayed close to the seafloor. First analyses of current trajectories showed that the sediment resettled rather quickly. It became clear that plume behaviour during large‐scale mining cannot be extrapolated from these small‐scale and short‐term experiments. In resume, cruise SO 242 / 1 was very successful and research should continue in the DEA area, which is undoubtedly the best studied long‐term deep sea disturbance site in the ocean...|$|R
40|$|Airports {{that operate}} under cold weather {{conditions}} face major challenges {{in ensuring that}} runways, taxiways and aprons provide sufficient tire-pavement friction to the operating aircraft. This thesis is motivated by two practical problems: (1) maintaining or improving the pavement surface conditions in an, for airline companies, acceptable state and (2) accurately reporting the actual surface conditions to the relevant actors (pilots, air traffic control, winter maintenance services). The primary objective of this thesis is to broaden the general knowledge base of these problems. The work {{can be divided into}} a practical, a fundamental, and an applied part of the thesis. The practical part includes a field study on how runway surface conditions change in time and the consequences for runway operability. Different situations were documented where the runway surface conditions changed due to snow fall, sand displacement by aircraft, ice deposition, snow compaction, and melting of the contamination layer. These cases highlighted two weaknesses in the current reporting system: (1) the constrained inspection frequency of the runway surface and (2) the limited possibilities to monitor the surface conditions while the runway is open for air traffic. The practical part also included field studies on a new sanding method, based on pre-wetting the sand with hot water. Practical experiences from maintenance personnel were collected, runway surface conditions were documented, and comments from pilots on the reported conditions were investigated. The method provides a solution for the problem that loose sand can be displaced or blown off the runway by the engine thrust of operating aircraft. In addition, the study highlighted some potential negative effects related to the sanding method. The high friction values that are typically measured on surfaces treated with warm pre-wetted sand can create a too optimistic picture of the prevailing conditions for aircrafts. Cases are documented where pilots faced worse conditions than they expected from the provided friction numbers. In 66 % of the cases there were clear indications available that the situation was not as good as suggested by the friction measurements. Another aspect is the risk of Foreign Object Damage (FOD). Maintenance personnel pointed out the importance of proper pavement cleaning prior to the sand application. The fundamental part of the thesis focuses on the role of sand in the creation of tirepavement friction on iced surfaces. The presence of sand particles changes the interaction between the tire, the pavement, the contamination layer, and the atmosphere in which the interaction takes place. Hence, it changes the way friction is created. The interactions were studied on a macroscopic scale by observing tire tracks on sanded, iced runways and by aircraft braking experiments on ice treated with loose and warm, pre-wetted sand. These observations showed that loose sand particles, ones trapped between the tire and the ice, can slide together with the rubber tread and plough into the ice layer. Loose sand particles can pile-up in front of, and under, locked tires (full skid). Such tire lock-ups can occur, even though when aircraft are equipped with anti-skid braking systems because these systems become disabled below a certain threshold speed (ranging between 30 and 45 km/h, depending on the aircraft type). On freeze bonded sand (produced by the warm, pre-wetted sanding method), friction can be provided by both loose particles that plough into the ice and by particles that stay fixed to the ice and force the tire tread to deform. The sand-ice and rubber-ice interactions were also studied on a microscopic scale by etching and replicating the ice surface. These observations revealed that the sliding friction process involved ice deformation in both cases. During rubber-ice sliding friction, the original crystal structure of the ice remained intact during the interaction. However, small scale ice deformation was evident by the formation of dislocations, aligned in rows along the sliding direction, and by the formation of small scale <b>ploughing</b> <b>tracks.</b> In the case of sand-ice interaction, the ploughing of sand particles was accompanied with the formation of cells within the original crystal structure of the ice. This re-crystallization was observed both in the laboratory and in the field. The rubber-ice and sand-ice sliding friction mechanisms were studied quantitatively by using a British Pendulum Tester in a cold laboratory experiment. It was found that the observed variability in friction measurements was significantly larger than the uncertainties introduced by the instrument itself. The variability may be caused by poorly controllable/reproducible, microscopic or nanoscopic surface properties of the ice and rubber. Rubber-ice interaction resulted in appreciable friction coefficients (0. 5 ≥ μ ≥ 0. 2) at ice temperatures below - 5 °C. However, it dropped significantly (down to μ = 0. 05) over the whole tested temperature range to by the presence of little snow on the ice (less than 1 mm). It demonstrated that friction provided by rubber-ice interaction is very vulnerable to snow contamination. In contrast, sand-ice friction measurements did not show the dramatic drop in friction by the same amount of snow. Hence, the ploughing of relatively large sand particles provided a more robust mechanism of friction, compared to rubber-ice friction. The applied part of the thesis comprises an exploratory study on a non-contacting measurement principle to quantify the amount and distribution of sand particles on a pavement. A static laboratory arrangement was build where sanded pavements were illuminated by a visible laser light source (wavelength: 635 nm) at different angles of incidence. The radiance from the illuminated area was recorded with a digital camera at different angles. The test matrix included dry and iced pavements and different sand application rates. A correlation between the total radiance and sand application rate was only found when there was negligible radiance from the pavement in the scene. The sand detection therefore required a distinction between radiance originating from the sand and the radiance originating from the pavement. However, due to the similarities in optical properties of the sand and the aggregates in the pavement (both originate from crushed rock) and the transparency of ice in the visible range, it seemed unlikely that the distinction can be {{made on the basis of}} radiance intensity. An alternative approach was investigated, based on triangulation. Image analysis techniques were used to define a region of interest where the radiance only originates from the sand. Within this region, individual sand particles can be identified and counted. The principle was developed theoretically for flat surfaces and adapted for application on rough surfaces of unknown topography. It was tested on a selected group of images, taken under favourable incidence and camera angles. The algorithm placed the region of interest reasonably well in all analyzed images, resulting in a rather conservative input in the subsequent analyses. The sand detection algorithm had a success rate between 63 and 100 %, depending on the surface contamination. The errors were mainly caused by not detecting particles that were located in the lower parts of the surface topography. Only few mistakes were made by incorrectly identifying particles. Hence, the number of detected particles was a conservative estimate of the actual number of particles located in the region.
