50|$|It is {{immediately}} apparent from the Leibniz quote above {{that there are}} implications for sampling. Deming observed that in any forecasting activity, the population is that of future events while the sampling frame is, inevitably, some subset of historical events. Deming held that the disjoint nature of <b>population</b> <b>and</b> <b>sampling</b> frame was inherently problematic once the existence of special-cause variation was admitted, rejecting the general use of probability and conventional statistics in suchsituations. He articulated the difficulty as the distinction between analytic and enumerative statistical studies.|$|E

40|$|M. Cur. The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} study was to describe guidelines to improve the community health clinics as a learning context conducive to learning. The objectives of the study commenced by getting the perception of student nurses, community sisters and college tutors, to explore and describe the problems experienced in relation to community health clinics as a learning context for student nurses, especially when they are allocated for their clinical practicals to prepare them to become competent. The research design and method used, consisted of a qualitative approach to achieve the intended goal of the research study. The design was divided into two phases: Phase one consisted of a field/empirical study and phase two consisted of conceptualization. Phase one has three steps where each step indicates the research method, <b>population</b> <b>and</b> <b>sampling,</b> data collection and data analysis. <b>Population</b> <b>and</b> <b>sampling</b> for step I included all the fourth year students from a nursing college in Gauteng, who are in an educational programme leading to registration as a nurse (general, psychiatric and community) and midwife. <b>Population</b> <b>and</b> <b>sampling</b> for step II consisted of community sisters from ten community health clinics in the Southern Metropolitan Local Council. <b>Population</b> <b>and</b> <b>sampling</b> for step III consisted of community college tutors from a college in Gauteng; the sample size consisted of the whole population. In all the steps follow-up interviews were conducted to confirm the findings. To ensure trustworthiness Lincoln and Guba's (1985) model was implemented, and data analysis were according to Tesch's (1990 in Creswell, 1994 : 155) method, based on a qualitative approach. The major problems reflected in the research findings based on Step I, II, II indicate similarities and Step III only indicates some uniqueness. The conceptual framework was discussed, indicating a body of knowledge, based on the study and empirical findings from phase I, to give clear meaning and understanding regarding the research study. Problems from all the steps were used in an integrated manner as research findings and were compared with existing literature within the framework, to determine similarities and differences as literature control method. Guidelines were then formulated from phases I and II, to solve the indicated problems, based on the three different sample groups. Guidelines were supported by the conclusion statement from chapter four and the problem statement from chapter three. Essential actions were indicated for operationalisation. Ethical consideration was maintained throughout the research study. The study has been evaluated by means {{of positive and negative}} issues related to the actual research process. Recommendations related to nursing education, nursing practice and nursing research were indicated accordingly...|$|E
