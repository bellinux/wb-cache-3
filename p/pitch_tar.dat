40|$|This study {{describes}} {{tripper car}} operators’ exposure to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles at an operation at Coal Distribution Steam Plant {{that involves the}} use of coal tar mix to feed as fuel the steam generating boilers. A cross-sectional task-based exposure assessment approached was used. The objectives of this study were to monitor tripper car operators’ exposures to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles as benzene soluble fraction and to then compare the measured concentrations with the occupational exposure limit. The general aim {{of the study was to}} accumulate data about employee exposure to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles in South African Petrochemical Refineries. A total of 56 samples was collected and analyzed for coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles – benzene soluble fraction. Of the 56 samples, 41 were personal samples collected on the breathing zones of the workers and 15 samples were field blank samples. The method used for the collection of the samples was the United States Department of Labor, Occupational Safety & Health Administration Method 58. In South Africa the available occupational exposure limit for coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles is the time weighted average occupational exposure limit – recommended limit for cyclohexane soluble fraction which is 0. 14 mg/m 3. For the evaluation of personal exposure to compare with the occupational exposure limit, the UK Health & Safety Executive Method for the Determination of Hazardous Substances (MDHS) 68 was adopted in the past to monitor workplace air. This method was since withdrawn by the Health & Safety Executive after research conducted by the Health & Safety Laboratory revealed that unacceptable variability were introduced into the method due to the small mass changes involved and the difficulty in accurately weighing the filters before and after the cyclohexane extraction. Due to the unavailability of a suitable and acceptable method to assess workers’ exposure to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles – cyclohexane soluble fraction to compare to the South African occupational exposure limit, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration Method Number 58 was used during this study for the collection of the samples. This is a validated method. This method follows a similar approach as the MDHS 68 however benzene is used instead of cyclohexane during sample extraction. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration have the permissible exposure limit of 0. 2 mg/m 3 for coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles – benzene soluble fraction to use when assessing worker exposure. This limit was used during this study for assessing tripper car exposure to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles. No coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles were detected on the samples collected during the study. The results revealed concentrations below detection limit of the test laboratory analytical method. The detection limit used thereof was 0. 1 mg per sample. The tripper car operators were therefore exposed to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles at concentrations that complied with the permissible exposure limit 0. 2 mg/m 3. The hypothesis of this study was that the tripper car operators at Coal Distribution Steam Plant are over exposed to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles – benzene soluble fraction. This hypothesis is therefore rejected. Based on the results derived from this study it is recommended that further research studies be conducted specifically with focus on different methods of exposure assessment to workers exposed to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles in South African Petrochemical Refinery Plants. - ii - Since the method used was limited to the particulate phase of the contaminant exposure, with the gaseous phase of exposure to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> volatiles only looked at when the PEL is exceeded.

There is a good deal of water about Mudfog, and yet it is not exactly the sort of town for a watering-place, either. Water is a perverse sort of element at the best of times, and in Mudfog it is particularly so. In winter, it comes oozing down the streets and tumbling over the fields,--nay, rushes into the very cellars and kitchens of the houses, with a lavish prodigality that might well be dispensed with; but in the hot summer weather it WILL dry up, and turn green: and, although green is a very good colour in its way, especially in grass, still it certainly is not becoming to water; and it cannot be denied that the beauty of Mudfog is rather impaired, even by this trifling circumstance. Mudfog is a healthy place--very healthy;--damp, perhaps, but none the worse for that.
