5|$|As Swedish is a Germanic language, the syntax shows {{similarities}} to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a subject–verb–object basic word order, but like German, it utilizes verb-second word order in main clauses, for instance after adverbs, adverbial <b>phrases</b> and dependent clauses. (Adverbial <b>phrases</b> denoting time are usually {{placed at the}} beginning of a main clause that is at the head of a sentence.) Prepositional <b>phrases</b> are placed in a place–manner–time order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives precede the noun they modify.|$|E
5|$|A {{complete}} Khmer sentence {{consists of}} four basic elements which include an optional topic, an optional subject, an obligatory predicate and various adverbials and particles.

5|$|Some {{linguists}} {{have argued}} that Nahuatl displays the properties of a non-configurational language, meaning that word order in Nahuatl is basically free. Nahuatl allows all possible orderings of the three basic sentence constituents. It is prolifically a pro-drop language: it allows sentences with omission of all noun <b>phrases</b> or independent pronouns, not just of noun <b>phrases</b> or pronouns whose function is the sentence subject. In most varieties independent pronouns are used only for emphasis. It allows certain kinds of syntactically discontinuous expressions.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules by}} which signs can be {{combined}} to form words and <b>phrases</b> are called syntax or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, <b>phrases,</b> and texts is called semantics.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} Local Maximum <b>Phrase</b> Detection (LMPD) method for the {{analysis}} of <b>phrasing</b> strategies in expressive performances. The LMPD method systematically extracts a quantitative representation of <b>phrasing</b> strategy by equating the occurrence of a local maximum in the loudness curve with the occurrence of a <b>phrase</b> or sub-phrase. We further define mathematical descriptors for <b>phrase</b> strength and volatility, and <b>phrase</b> typicality, for comparing <b>phrasing</b> strategies among performances. <b>Phrase</b> strength measures the prominence or clarity of a <b>phrase,</b> and the volatility is defined as the standard deviation of the <b>phrase</b> strengths within a performance. <b>Phrase</b> typicality quantifies {{the degree to which a}} <b>phrase</b> peak location is characteristic among the performances polled. We illustrate the LMPD method using preliminary results from its application to eleven commercially available audio recordings of a solo violin Bach Sonata. ...|$|R

Online {{multiplayer}} games can be played either with registered friends or with randomly selected participants. Additionally, players can converse with up to four <b>phrases</b> that are preset by the player, which appear as speech bubbles when activated. These names and <b>phrases</b> are not displayed in random-player matches.

5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} <b>phrases</b> (e.g. Noun <b>Phrases,</b> Verb <b>Phrases,</b> and Prepositional <b>Phrases).</b> A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E
30|$|Verb <b>phrase</b> (verb+noun <b>phrase)</b> (CBANP). In the parsing tree of a sentence, if a noun <b>phrase</b> node has an {{ancestor}} verb <b>phrase</b> node (VP), we say the noun <b>phrase</b> {{is dominated by}} the action in the VP. For instance, in “Register account”, the noun <b>phrase</b> node “account” has a father VP node of action “Register” as shown in Fig.  4 a, then the noun <b>phrase</b> {{is dominated by the}} action.|$|R

5|$|Programming of Dynamic Speech Generating devices {{is usually}} done by augmentative {{communication}} specialists. Specialists {{are required to}} cater {{to the needs of}} the patients because the patients usually choose what kinds of words/ <b>phrases</b> they want. For example, patients use different <b>phrases</b> based on their age, disability, interests, etc. Therefore, content organization is extremely time consuming. Additionally, SGDs are rarely covered by health insurance companies. As a result, resources are very limited with regards to both funding and staffing. Dr. John Costello of Boston Children’s Hospital has been the driving force soliciting donations to keep these program running and well-staffed both within his hospital and in hospitals across the country.|$|E

5|$|The album has a melodic form, and employs pentatonic {{scales for}} melodic development, a {{practice}} common in African and African-American folk music. Goin' Home is mostly tempoless, {{as most of}} the pieces are performed in a rubato-like free rhythm. Shepp and Parlan perform sudden accelerations and intended delays and halts, particularly at the end of bars, <b>phrases,</b> and sections in a piece. Most of the spirituals have a thirty-two-bar form, with the eight-bar section comprising four two-bar <b>phrases</b> wherein two choruses of the spiritual are played. Shepp and Parlan's interpretations include few choruses from the original spirituals.|$|E
5|$|The participial mood {{is used to}} {{construct}} a subordinate clause describing its subject {{in the state of}} carrying out an activity.

40|$|<b>Phrase</b> Reading The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if <b>phrase</b> reading training with fourth graders would significantly enhance the development of reading skills for the purposes of obtaining and using new information.

In a community setting with children of social-cultural opportunity who are achieving at an expected or above annual rate a supplemental need for <b>phrase</b> reading training was not indicated. An appendix is included which discusses <b>phrase</b> reading programs for intermediate grades. (WR) ...|$|R
