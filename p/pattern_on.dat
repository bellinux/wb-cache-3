These have been developed extensively, second only to the classical methylene reagents (R1=R2=H).

5|$|After the {{eleventh}} century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in structurally more stable walls that could incorporate more refined architectural moulding and detailing {{that can be}} seen in corbelling, buttressing, lintels and arching. At the same time there were increasing influences from English and continental European designs. These {{can be seen in the}} Romanesque chevron <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> the piers in the nave of Dunfermline Abbey (1130–40), which were modelled on details from Durham Cathedral. St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney, begun in 1137, may have employed masons that had worked at Durham. The arrival of the new monastic orders in Scotland from the twelfth century led to a boom in ecclesiastical building using English and continental forms, including abbeys at Kelso, Holyrood, Jedburgh and St Andrews.|$|E
5|$|Although Ferugliotherium {{teeth are}} much lower-crowned {{than those of}} the Sudamericidae, they share an {{essentially}} similar <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> the occlusal (chewing) surface of mf1 and mf2, similar incisors, backward jaw movement during chewing, and enamel with small prisms. Ferugliotherium is thought to have been a small animal, with a body mass of about 70g (2.5oz), and may have eaten insects and plant material. Its remains have been found in two geological formations of southern Argentina, where {{it is part of a}} mammal fauna that also includes the sudamericid Gondwanatherium and a variety of dryolestoids.|$|E

5|$|An {{equivalent}} way of {{stating the}} same condition is that, if the angles are partitioned into two alternating subsets, then {{the sum of}} the angles in either of the two subsets is exactly 180 degrees. However, this equivalent form applies only to a crease <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> a flat piece of paper, whereas the alternating sum form of the condition remains valid for crease patterns on conical sheets of paper with nonzero defect at the vertex.|$|E
5|$|Early radio {{telescope}} interferometers used a single baseline for measurement. Later astronomical interferometers, {{such as the}} Very Large Array illustrated in Fig11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> the ground. A limited number of baselines will result in insufficient coverage. This was alleviated by using {{the rotation of the}} Earth to rotate the array relative to the sky. Thus, a single baseline could measure information in multiple orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called Earth-rotation synthesis. Baselines thousands of kilometers long were achieved using very long baseline interferometry.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, Michael Naify and William Nasser {{turned to}} Pflueger {{again for a}} new {{neighborhood}} theater design based on the Alhambra in Grenada, Spain. The Alhambra Theatre opened on November 5, 1926 with a grand facade flanked by twin minarets that glowed red at night. Pflueger's vision stayed firmly planted in the Moorish Revival style, complete to the iron scrollwork and amber shade redesign of two municipal streetlamps standing outside of the theater. Pflueger worked with muralist Arthur Frank Mathews to achieve a rich palette of color most prominently displayed in a geometric floral <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> the main ceiling. The Alhambra was named San Francisco Landmark No. 217 in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook plesseni {{is known}} from Pantar and Alor Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It was {{described}} by Erwin Stresemann in 1929. The upperparts are grey-brown and heavily spotted and marked with white, giving rise to a cross-barred <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> its back. Its underparts have longitudinal white streaks and its tail is prominently barred. It lives in Eucalyptus urophylla woodlands, and has an unusual low-pitched call different to subspecies boobook. Genetic and call analysis show it to be markedly divergent to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species.|$|E

In the end, Porthos recovers following a pituitary transplant from an alien chameleon. Finally swallowing his pride, Archer then goes down to the Kreetassan capital and delivers an intricate ritual apology which involves slicing a tree trunk with a chainsaw, arranging the pieces of wood in a complex <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> the ground, and chanting phrases in the Kreetassan language. Having successfully apologised to the Kreetassans, the crew finally manage to procure three plasma injectors prior to their departure.|$|E
5|$|The Yellow Line was {{originally}} planned {{to follow a}} slightly different route in Virginia. The plan would have sent Yellow Line trains to Franconia–Springfield, with Blue Line trains serving Huntington. This was changed due to a shortage of rail cars {{at the time of}} the completion of the line to Huntington. Because fewer rail cars were required to operate Yellow Line service than would be required to run Blue Line service out to Huntington – due to the Yellow Line's shorter route – the line designations were switched. From 1999 to 2008, the Yellow Line operated to Franconia–Springfield on July 4, as part of Metro's special service <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> that day.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Cindy {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} wave that departed the western coast of Africa on August8, 1993. Over the following days, the wave tracked steadily west-northwestward across the tropical Atlantic while retaining a distinct cloud <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> satellite images. Although initial data from a reconnaissance aircraft mission on August13 indicated that the system lacked a defined wind circulation, a second mission at 12:00UTC the next day revealed an improvement in its structure at the lower levels of the atmosphere. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) thus classified the system as a tropical depressiona tropical cyclone with sustained winds of less than 39mph (62km/h)and initiated public advisories on it soon thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The {{superfamily}} Rhinocerotoidea, {{which includes}} modern rhinoceroses, {{can be traced}} back to the early Eoceneabout 50 million years agowith early precursors such as Hyrachyus. Rhinocerotoidea contains three families; Amynodontidae, Rhinocerotidae ("true rhinoceroses"), and Hyracodontidae. The diversity within the rhinoceros group was much larger in prehistoric times; they ranged from dog-sized to the size of Paraceratherium. There were long-legged, cursorial forms adapted for running and squat, semi aquatic forms. Most species did not have horns. Rhinoceros fossils are identified as such mainly by characteristics of their teeth, which is the part of the animals most likely to be preserved. The upper molars of most rhinoceroses have a pi-shaped (π) <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> the crown, and each lower molar has paired L-shapes. Various skull features are also used for identification of fossil rhinoceroses.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} other red-pored, bluing boletes {{that could be}} {{confused}} with S.amygdalinus. The poisonous European species Rubroboletus satanas and its North American counterpart R.eastwoodiae have lighter colored caps and a reticulate <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> the stipe. B.subvelutipes is a highly variable species from eastern North America that includes red in its range of cap colors, and has a fuzzy coating of hairs near the base of its stipe; it may represent a group of species. Another similar species is B.luridiformis, found in North America and Northern Europe under both broadleaf trees and conifers. Unlike S.amygdalinus, however, B.luridiformis has a dark brown to nearly blackish-brown cap, and a yellow stipe with a dense covering of red pruina (dots).|$|E
