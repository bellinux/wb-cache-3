40|$|The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} forecast basis {{is crucial to}} risk management strategies employed by many agribusiness firms. Previous research has examined how to effectively use basis forecasts and what factors affect basis, but literature focusing on forecasting basis is sparse. This research evaluates the impact of adopting a time-to-expiration approach, {{as compared to the}} more common calendar approach, when forecasting feeder cattle, live cattle, and hog basis. Furthermore, the optimal number of past year's basis levels to include in making basis predictions is evaluated in an out-of-sample framework. Absolute basis forecasts errors are generated for all three commodities and evaluated to determine the signifcance of the two issues mentioned above. Results indicate that basis forecasters should consider using three-year historical averages for feeder cattle and four-year historical averages for live cattle and lean hogs when making basis forecasts. Furthermore, the use of a time-to-expiration method of calculating historical average basis results in very little improvement in basis prediction accuracy compared to the calendar approach. livestock <b>prices,</b> <b>basis,</b> hedging, basis forecasts, Livestock Production/Industries, Marketing,...|$|R

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{mortgage}} default {{is closely related to}} house prices. When house prices fall the borrower has an incentive to default. Since default incurs substantial cost to the lender, the borrower and many other market participants, as well as the society, house price is a risk in a mortgage contract. This was clearly demonstrated during the 2007 - 09 financial crisis. In this thesis I discuss some (potential) measures to manage mortgage default risk arising from low house prices. Chapter 1 is on mortgage insurance. Mortgage insurance is commonly used by lenders to transfer mortgage default risk to an insurer. After a brief introduction of the mortgage and mortgage insurance markets in US and Canada, I specify a simple mortgage insurance contract and a multiple state model for mortgage termination. The contract is then priced under the model. I explore the possibility of hedging house price risk in Chapter 2. If we assume a perfect market where house price risk can be traded exists, and a mortgage contract is a contingent claim on house prices, then the classic delta hedging is useful in hedging house price risk. In chapter 3 I discuss an innovative type of mortgage contract [...] property index-linked mortgage. The purpose of this contract design is to reduce the borrower's propensity to default when house price declines. In particular, when house price declines, the mortgage balance and payment are reduced. I analyze this contract from the borrower's perspective and find that such contracts are effective in reducing default incentives and as a result, the lender may also be better off due to lower deadweight default cost. The last chapter focuses on house <b>price</b> <b>basis</b> risk. House <b>price</b> <b>basis</b> risk refers to the situation where the value of an individual property appreciates differently from the index. This may lead to problems such as suboptimal hedging, underpricing and lower efficiency for financial products involving house price index. In this chapter I develop a basis risk model {{that can be used to}} simulate reasonable individual house prices for a given index...|$|E

Demography directly affects the needs of consumers regarding the risks to be covered; the structure of liabilities is important due to the limited possibilities to hedge many of them; the securitization process has been less relevant for insurance companies than for other financial intermediaries; regulation is different and implemented by different authorities; accounting is usually carried out on a <b>price</b> <b>basis</b> in the banking sector and on a cost basis in the insurance sector; and distribution channels require different expertise.

40|$|The optimal crop revenue {{insurance}} contract is designed from {{recent developments in}} the theory of insurance economics under incomplete markets. The message is two-fold. Firstly, when the indemnity schedule is contingent on individual price and individual yield, the optimal contract depends only on the individual gross revenue. Secondly, this policy is shown to fail if the indemnity function is based on aggregate price and/or aggregate yield. A closed-form solution, in which basis risks are ignored, is proposed. It differs from actual revenue insurance programs proposed to the U. S. farmers.
