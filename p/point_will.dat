5|$|During {{the process}} of meiotic cell division, an event called genetic {{recombination}} or crossing-over can sometimes occur, in which a length of DNA on one chromatid is swapped with a length of DNA on the corresponding homologous non-sister chromatid. This can result in reassortment of otherwise linked alleles. The Mendelian principle of independent assortment asserts that each of a parent's two genes for each trait will sort independently into gametes; which allele an organism inherits for one trait is unrelated to which allele it inherits for another trait. This is in fact only true for genes that do not reside on the same chromosome, or are located very far from one another on the same chromosome. The closer two genes lie on the same chromosome, the more closely they will be associated in gametes and the more often they will appear together; genes that are very close are essentially never separated because it is extremely unlikely that a crossover <b>point</b> <b>will</b> occur between them. This is known as genetic linkage.|$|E

25|$|At a {{temperature}} below the boiling point, any matter in liquid form will evaporate until the condensation of gas above reach an equilibrium. At {{this point the}} gas will condense {{at the same rate}} as the liquid evaporates. Thus, a liquid cannot exist permanently if the evaporated liquid is continually removed. A liquid at its boiling <b>point</b> <b>will</b> evaporate more quickly than the gas can condense at the current pressure. A liquid at or above its boiling <b>point</b> <b>will</b> normally boil, though superheating can prevent this in certain circumstances.|$|E
5000|$|Teams {{with the}} most <b>points</b> <b>will</b> play for the Cup. Teams with the second highest <b>points</b> <b>will</b> play for the Plate.

50|$|In early 2008, Tel Aviv Municipality {{announced}} a pilot scheme to build charging stations for electric cars. Initially, five charging <b>points</b> <b>will</b> be built, and eventually 150 <b>points</b> <b>will</b> {{be set up}} across the city {{as part of the}} Israeli electric car project, Project Better Place. Furthermore, battery replacement <b>points</b> <b>will</b> be located at the city's entrances.|$|R

25|$|Regardless of the {{ultimate}} design of the new bridge, the landing <b>point</b> <b>will</b> be the former Grove Cranes site in Pallion. Plans for this site focus around {{the creation of a}} new residential area, with homes, community buildings, commercial and retail space.|$|E
25|$|In Euclidean {{geometry}} {{the lines}} remain {{at a constant}} distance from each other (meaning that a line drawn perpendicular to one line at any <b>point</b> <b>will</b> intersect the other line {{and the length of}} the line segment joining the points of intersection remains constant) and are known as parallels.|$|E
50|$|The Fair Play Award will {{be given}} to the team with the best overall {{discipline}} throughout the tournament. Teams {{will be given}} a certain amount of points—15 in the first stage, 5 in the quarterfinals, and 10 points for the remaining four teams—from which <b>points</b> <b>will</b> be deducted depending on the infraction. The team that advanced past the first stage with the most <b>points</b> <b>will</b> be awarded the trophy. Teams that drop below 0 <b>points</b> <b>will</b> be excluded from winning the award.|$|R
5000|$|Additional {{championship}} <b>points</b> <b>will</b> {{be awarded}} to the top three crews on a televised stage {{on the final day}} of each rally, known as the [...] "Power Stage". 3 <b>points</b> <b>will</b> be {{awarded to the}} stage winner, with 2 and 1 for second and third respectively.|$|R

25|$|On 31 January 2017, the ABC {{issued a}} {{statement}} that the show had been cancelled and would not return in 2017. The spin-off for younger gamers, Spawn <b>Point,</b> <b>will</b> continue with a new format and branding. Janet Carr confirmed that the show was cancelled after ABC received news that Good Game hosts Hex and NichBoy had been hired by Channel 7 to start a rival gaming show.|$|E
25|$|One {{potential}} {{result of}} the Laffer curve is that increasing tax rates beyond a certain <b>point</b> <b>will</b> become counterproductive for raising further tax revenue. A hypothetical Laffer curve for any given economy can only be estimated and such estimates are sometimes controversial. The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics reports that estimates of revenue-maximizing tax rates have varied widely, with a mid-range of around 70%.|$|E
25|$|In a {{physical}} sense, this zero-wind <b>point</b> <b>will</b> {{be the center}} of a cyclone or anticyclone. (Like the swirled hairs on the tennis ball, the wind will spiral around this zero-wind point - under our assumptions it cannot flow into or out of the point.) In brief, then, the theorem dictates that, given at least some wind on Earth, there must at all times be a cyclone or anticyclone somewhere.|$|E

25|$|The {{ride to the}} Champs-Élysées is {{traditionally}} free of attacks prior to the famous avenue, and the GC standings from the previous stage usually stand as the final result, as only sprinters (who are very low in the GC at this <b>point)</b> <b>will</b> usually attack. However, with only 31 seconds separating the top three men, there was much speculation that {{that would not be}} the case during this final stage.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the effects}} of precession, the First Point of Libra, (also known as the autumn equinox point) lies within the {{boundaries}} of Virgo very close to β Virginis. This is one of the two points in the sky where the celestial equator crosses the ecliptic (the other being the First Point of Aries, now in the constellation of Pisces.) This <b>point</b> <b>will</b> pass into the neighbouring constellation of Leo around the year 2440.|$|E
25|$|As a {{thundercloud}} {{moves over}} the surface of the Earth, an equal electric charge, but of opposite polarity, is induced on the Earth's surface underneath the cloud. The induced positive surface charge, when measured against a fixed <b>point,</b> <b>will</b> be small as the thundercloud approaches, increasing as the center of the storm arrives and dropping as the thundercloud passes. The referential value of the induced surface charge could be roughly represented as a bell curve.|$|E

25|$|Affine shape {{adaptation}} is {{a methodology}} for iteratively adapting {{the shape of}} the smoothing kernels in an affine group of smoothing kernels to the local image structure in neighbourhood region of a specific image point. Equivalently, affine shape adaptation can be accomplished by iteratively warping a local image patch with affine transformations while applying a rotationally symmetric filter to the warped image patches. Provided that this iterative process converges, the resulting fixed <b>point</b> <b>will</b> be affine invariant. In the area of computer vision, this idea has been used for defining affine invariant interest point operators as well as affine invariant texture analysis methods.|$|E
25|$|The Magistrates and Judges are {{appointed}} by the High Court, as is the President of the Criminal Law Court. The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General. The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties. It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the Co-Princes and two by the General Council. They serve eight-year terms. The Court is presided over {{by one of the}} Judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one <b>point</b> <b>will</b> preside over the Court.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} actions in Dying Light can help players to earn {{experience}} points. Engaging in combat with enemies will help players to earn Power points, while performing parkour movement can earn Agility points. Completing missions, challenges and quests will help players to earn Survival points. If the players earns experience, {{they can spend}} skill points on a skill tree and upgrade the playable character with new skills. During daytime, if the player's character is killed, survival points will be deducted. In contrast, no survival <b>point</b> <b>will</b> be deducted if the player's character is killed at night. All experience points will also be boosted if the player explores at night.|$|E

5000|$|Following the 26-race regular season, the 16 {{drivers with}} the most wins, with {{championship}} points as a tiebreaker, will qualify for the playoffs (re-branded from the [...] "Chase for the Championship"). At this point the top 10 drivers on the championship <b>points</b> standings <b>will</b> be awarded additional playoff points; the regular-season champion will receive 15, second place will receive 10, and the remainder descending from 8 to 1. If a driver qualifies for the post-season, their championship <b>points</b> <b>will</b> be reset to 2000, and their banked playoff <b>points</b> <b>will</b> be added to this total. The playoffs will continue to use the existing multi-round elimination format; playoff <b>points</b> <b>will</b> be carried over through all but the final race of the season.|$|R

25|$|The {{theory of}} early {{streamer}} emission proposes {{that if a}} lightning rod has a mechanism producing ionization near its tip, then its lightning capture area is greatly increased. At first, small quantities of radioactive isotopes (radium-226 or americium-241) were used as sources of ionization between 1930 and 1980, later replaced with various electrical and electronic devices. According to an early patent, since most lightning protectors' ground potentials are elevated, the path distance from the source to the elevated ground <b>point</b> <b>will</b> be shorter, creating a stronger field (measured in volts per unit distance) and that structure will be more prone to ionization and breakdown.|$|E
25|$|Since {{becoming}} operational in September 2010, {{work has}} continued on the signalling, the signal box became operational during summer 2015 allowing the temporary ground frame and shed to be removed. A Trap <b>point</b> <b>will</b> be fitted {{to the exit}} of the siding south of Thuxton station, as well as additional signals including signals allowing bi-directional movements in the down platform and a ground frame at Garvestone crossing with associated gate locks and distant signals interlocked with Thuxton signal box. The completed scheme will allow the train from Wymondham to arrive before the train from Dereham when two trains are operating, this isn't currently possible. Locomotives will {{also be able to}} run round their trains in the station.|$|E
25|$|The {{melting point}} is {{sensitive}} to extremely large changes in pressure, but generally this sensitivity is orders of magnitude less than that for the boiling point, because the solid-liquid transition represents only a small change in volume. If, as observed in most cases, a substance is more dense in the solid than in the liquid state, the melting <b>point</b> <b>will</b> increase with increases in pressure. Otherwise the reverse behavior occurs. Notably, {{this is the case}} of water, as illustrated graphically to the right, but also of Si, Ge, Ga, Bi. With extremely large changes in pressure, substantial changes to the melting point are observed. For example, the melting point of silicon at ambient pressure (0.1 MPa) is 1415°C, but at pressures in excess of 10 GPa it decreases to 1000°C.|$|E
