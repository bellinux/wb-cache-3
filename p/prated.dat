2500|$|It is possible, as {{he wrote}} later, that he was warned {{by a group of}} merchants that there was a plot to murder him if he was to {{re-enter}} Rome. This claim could be merely an exaggeration to reinforce himself as a defender of Protestantism. However, Milton's theological frankness did limit what Manso could do for him as patron. A lingering reputation is suggested by what Nicolaas Heinsius, a Dutch poet, later wrote: [...] "That Englishman was hated by the Italians, among whom he lived a long time, on account of his over-strict morals, because he both disputed freely about religion, and on any occasion whatever <b>prated</b> very bitterly against the Roman Pontiff." [...] Regardless, these were all points that Milton later took pride in. He actually spent two months in Rome on his return journey.|$|E

5000|$|The sub-pot {{starts out}} with Lollia, {{the wife of}} <b>Prate,</b> and Coloquintida, her friend and neighbor, talking about wealth, <b>Prate,</b> and Alphonso. Most of the {{conversation}} hangs on Lollia’s husband, <b>Prate,</b> who has an anger which “is the worst favour’dest ... of any man’s in all Sicily”. The reader learns that Lord Alphonso has a fancy for Lollia, and she likewise has a fancy for him. <b>Prate</b> enters the scene looking for his wife. Fearful of his anger Lollia distracts him by scolding him for how poorly he dresses. The distraction works as <b>Prate</b> changes subjects informing his wife of the impending duel of the main plot, and has his clerk, Precedent, find “a good standing for his wife”. Believing his master is asking for advice about regaining “good standings” with Lollia, Precedent provides foolery {{in the form of}} misunderstanding the command, most of the advice having sexually undertones. Eventually <b>Prate</b> sets his clerk straight, and they all - Lollia, Cologuintida, Precedent, and <b>Prate</b> - leave for the duel. After the duel <b>Prate</b> and his party are returning to his house when he is greeted by Lord Florio. Florio gives <b>Prate</b> summons to the royal court for “the drawing out of agreements for the benefit of both kingdoms”. The orator promises to be there soon and then orders his wife to go straight home and remain chaste about her actions. Before the orator can head to the court, three of his clients - Drap, Velours, and Mechant - do their best to bring closure to their various suits. They all imply that he has been putting off their affairs for a while, but the orator informs them that he has “present business of the King’s” and he would attend to them later then runs off to court. After <b>Prate</b> has left for the court Lord Alphonso enters the scene looking for Lollia, hoping to woo her into adultery he professes his love to her. She agrees to see him at her home and after eight the next day when her husband goes to work. With a kiss they part ways, both eagerly expecting the new day.|$|R

During the transit, he sat with raised glasses in the frosty chill and mouldy fetor of his chariot, and glanced out sidelong on the holiday face of things, the shuttered shops, and the crowds along the pavement, much as the rider in the Tyburn cart may have observed the concourse gathering to his execution.|$|E

[...] "The problem was that there were no witnesses on that corner", another officer said early in 2002. [...] "We haven't heard anything like that from any people in the community; nobody has indicated that to us", <b>Prate</b> told WNYC a decade later.

60|$|Don Sebastian and {{his wife}} had lived {{together}} for fifteen years, with the entirest happiness to themselves and the greatest admiration of their neighbours. People said that such an example of conjugal felicity was not often seen in those degenerate days, for even then they <b>prated</b> of the golden age of their grandfathers, lamenting their own decadence.... As behoved good Castilians, burdened with such a line of noble ancestors, the fortunate couple conducted themselves with all imaginable gravity. No strange eye was permitted to witness a caress between the lord and his lady, or to hear an expression of endearment; but everyone could see the devotion of Don Sebastian, the look of adoration which filled his eyes when he gazed upon his wife. And people said that Doña Sodina was worthy of all his affection. They said that her virtue was only matched by her piety, and her piety was patent to the whole world, for every day she went to the cathedral at Xiormonez and remained long immersed in her devotions. Her charity was exemplary, and no beggar ever applied to her in vain.|$|E
6000|$|Then it {{was good}} to see the Captain's {{behaviour}} before the devilled turkey and the mutton chops! His stories poured forth unceasingly, and his spirits rose as he chatted to the young men. When he got a bit of sunshine, the old lazzarone basked in it; he <b>prated</b> about his own affairs and past splendour, and all the lords, generals, and Lord-Lieutenants he had ever known. He described the death of his darling Bessie, the late Mrs. Costigan, and the challenge he had sent to Captain Shanty Clancy, of the Slashers, for looking rude at Miss Fotheringay as she was on her kyar in the Phaynix; and then he described how the Captain apologised, gave a dinner at the Kildare Street, where six of them drank twinty-one bottles of claret, etc. He announced that to sit with two such noble and generous young fellows was the happiness and pride of an old soldier's existence; and having had a second glass of Curacoa, was so happy that he began to cry. Altogether we should say that the Captain was not a man of much strength of mind, or a very eligible companion for youth; but there are worse men, holding much better places in life, and more dishonest, who have never committed half so many rogueries as he. They walked out, the Captain holding an arm of each of his dear young friends, and in a maudlin state of contentment. He winked at one or two tradesmen's shops where, possibly, he owed a bill, as much as to say, [...] "See the company I'm in--sure I'll pay you, my boy,"--and they parted finally with Mr. Foker at a billiard-room, where the latter had a particular engagement with some gentlemen of Colonel Swallowtail's regiment.|$|E

The <b>Prate</b> hears everyone’s petition but the Mechant’s suit because <b>Prate</b> accuses the man of helping the King of Cyprus win the war over Sicily. The orator then leaves for the King’s court while consoling others of the city. The Mechant, who came to inform the orator of his wife’s adultery, is left disgraces and brooding. When Lord Alphonso arrives to lay “his horns in orator’s way”, the Mechant hides to witness the act. Moments later the orator comes running home for he had forgot his court files. Lollia hides Lord Alphonso in her closet but forgets his clothes which are on her bed. When <b>Prate</b> enters the room he suspects adultery and sees the clothes. Caught in the act Lollia is clever and lies telling her husband that a friend has brought the clothes over for him try on. The orator does so and finds them a good fit and tells his wife to buy them. Donning on his orator robes over them <b>Prate</b> then runs off to court. When it is safe for Lord Alphonso {{to come out of}} the closet Lollia informs him that the orator has taken his clothes and he must borrow one of the orator’s petticoats to cover himself or return home naked.|$|R
