25|$|The Seoul Central District Court {{granted the}} three members a {{temporary}} contract injunction in October 2009 {{and stated that}} S.M. Entertainment could not interfere with their individual activities, thus placing a halt on TVXQ's group activities in South Korea. The members claimed that the contract was unfair and they were left out of proper <b>profit</b> <b>distribution.</b> In response, S.M. Entertainment called a press conference and claimed that the lawsuit was not about unfair contracts or human rights, but motivated by the three members' greed to pursue their cosmetics business uninhibited by the restrictions of their exclusive contract with S.M. Entertainment. The agency submitted a complaint on criminal misdemeanor charges against the cosmetics company CreBeau; however, it was never brought to court by the prosecutor on grounds of insufficient evidence. The three replied that they hoped S.M. Entertainment would respect the court's decision.|$|E

40|$|This paper derives {{equilibrium}} {{financial contract}} forms in a risk-neutral capital market with asymmetrically informed borrowers/entrepreneurs and investors. In doing so, the analysis generalizes {{the work of}} D. DeMeza and D. Webb (1987) by allowing for arbitrary <b>profit</b> <b>distributions,</b> arbitrary contract forms, and variab le investment choices. The main result of this inquiry is as follows. W hen higher-quality entrepreneurs have "better" ex post <b>profit</b> <b>distributions</b> (in {{the sense of the}} monotone likelihood ratio propert y), equilibrium contracts take a standard debt form so long as admissibl e investor payoff functions are monotone nondecreasing in firm profit. Without the monotonicity constraint, contracts often take a differen t, "live-or-die" form. Copyright 1993 by The London School of Economics and Political Science. ...|$|R

50|$|When Marx {{created a}} simplified, {{abstract}} model of <b>profit</b> <b>distributions,</b> {{he was not}} primarily {{trying to prove that}} the two famous identities (total profit=total surplus value, and total product value=total production price) are compatible with price-value divergences and with <b>profit</b> <b>distributions</b> according to capital employed (to the contrary: for analytical purposes, Marx assumes that they are compatible). Instead, he was trying to model the basic parameters of business competition for a share of the new surplus-value from the products produced by the working class. By identifying what the business competition is ultimately about, Marx was able to explain both what really motivates the business owners, and why the surface appearance of the business process perceived by an individual is almost the exact inverse of the real economic process in society as a whole.|$|R

50|$|An {{approximate}} but conservative option value, {{termed the}} DM Range Option, {{can be estimated}} simply using range estimates of the present values of operating profit and launch costs. Fig. 3. As described, a range is an estimate of a maximum, most-likely (or mode) and minimum (or Optimistic, Most-Likely, Pessimistic) values that circumscribe a triangular distribution. The two distributions are then combined, and, similar to the approach for simulation described, the expected value is the first moment of all positive NPVs. Here, using equations from triangular distributions, {{the mean of the}} launch cost distribution is calculated. The present value imputed net <b>profit</b> <b>distribution</b> is the difference between the operating <b>profit</b> <b>distribution</b> and the mean value of the launch cost distribution. In one implementation, the approximate option value is the product of the mean and the probability of the payoff distribution right triangle, the positive value right tail. The DM Range Option requires no simulation. This approach is useful for early-stage estimates of project option value when there has not been sufficient time or resources to gather the necessary quantitative information required for a complete cash flow simulation, or in a portfolio of projects when simulation of all the projects is too computationally demanding. If the launch cost is a scalar value, then the range option value calculation is exact. The range option method is similar to the fuzzy method for real options.|$|E
