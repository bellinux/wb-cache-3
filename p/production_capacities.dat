Typically, community wind farms, solar photovoltaic arrays, geothermal installations, and biomass-fuelled power facilities are typically sufficiently limited in their generation capacity that they qualify as distributed energy sources. Conversely, large hydropower plants and offshore wind parks, with substantial <b>production</b> <b>capacities</b> of 50–100 MW or more which feed into high-voltage transmission grids, cannot be considered distributed generation.|$|E
25|$|Benzene is used {{mainly as}} an {{intermediate}} to make other chemicals, above all ethylbenzene, cumene, cyclohexane, nitrobenzene, and alkylbenzene. More {{than half of the}} entire benzene production is processed into ethylbenzene, a precursor to styrene, which is used to make polymers and plastics like polystyrene and EPS. Some 20% of the benzene production is used to manufacture cumene, which is needed to produce phenol and acetone for resins and adhesives. Cyclohexane consumes ca. 10% of the world's benzene production; it is primarily used in the manufacture of nylon fibers, which are processed into textiles and engineering plastics. Smaller amounts of benzene are used to make some types of rubbers, lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, explosives, and pesticides. In 2013, the biggest consumer country of benzene was China, followed by the USA. Benzene production is currently expanding in the Middle East and in Africa, whereas <b>production</b> <b>capacities</b> in Western Europe and North America are stagnating.|$|E

The world's major irradiation sources are the 85-megawatt High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, U.S., and the SM-2 loop reactor at the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (NIIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, Russia, which are both dedicated {{to the production of}} transcurium (Z> 96) elements.

2500|$|Open pond {{systems are}} cheaper to construct, at the minimum {{requiring}} only a trench or pond. Large ponds {{have the largest}} <b>production</b> <b>capacities</b> relative to other systems of comparable cost. Also, open pond cultivation can exploit unusual conditions that suit only specific algae. For instance, Dunaliella salina grow in extremely salty water; these unusual media exclude other types of organisms, allowing the growth of pure cultures in open ponds. Open culture can also work {{if there is a}} system of harvesting only the desired algae, or if the ponds are frequently re-inoculated before invasive organisms can multiply significantly. [...] The latter approach is frequently employed by Chlorella farmers, as the growth conditions for Chlorella do not exclude competing algae.|$|E
