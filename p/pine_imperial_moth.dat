5000|$|Eacles imperialis (<b>imperial</b> <b>moth)</b> is a Nearctic {{member of}} the family Saturniidae and {{subfamily}} Ceratocampinae. The wingspan of an adult is between 80-175 mm ( [...] and [...] inches).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Imperial</b> <b>moths</b> (their many {{regional}} morphs, subspecies, and sibling species) {{range from}} South America to Canada {{and from the}} Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Coast, where their colloquial name is [...] "Mothra." [...] Nominate Eacles imperialis imperialis has been recorded historically from New England and southern Canada, south to the Gulf of Mexico and west across the Great Plains. In modern times, its range has receded northward (where {{it was always a}} good find); it is considered common south of the Mason-Dixon line. Subspecies E. i. pini occurs in coniferous and transition zone woodlands at the northern edges of the New England and Great Lakes States and northward into Canada. In the southwest it is replaced by the closely related E. oslari. Other sub species are found in Mexico and South America.|$|R
2500|$|Most larvae spin a silken cocoon in {{the leaves}} of a {{preferred}} host plant or in leaf litter on the ground, or crevices in rocks and logs. While only moderately close relatives to the silkworm (Bombyx mori) among the Lepidoptera, the cocoons of most larger saturniids can be gathered and used to make silk fabric. However, larvae of some species [...] typically Ceratocampinae, like the regal moth (Citheronia regalis) and the <b>imperial</b> <b>moth</b> (Eacles imperialis), burrow and pupate in a small chamber beneath the soil. This is common in the Ceratocampinae and Hemileucinae. Unlike most silk moths, those that pupate underground do not use much silk in the construction. Once enclosed in the cocoon, the caterpillar sheds the larval skin and becomes a pupa, and the pupa undergoes metamorphosis for about 14, at which point it either emerges or goes into diapause. During metamorphosis, respiratory systems will stay intact, the digestive system will dissolve, and reproductive organs will take form.|$|R
50|$|The {{caterpillars}} tend {{to wander}} before settling down to eat. The first instar generally lasts {{only a few}} days. At {{the end of each}} instar, a small amount of silk is spun on the major vein of a leaf. The caterpillar then latches onto the silk with its anal claspers and prolegs and begins to molt. It first becomes dormant and undergoes apolysis, then after an additional day or so, undergoes ecdysis. The caterpillar emerges from its old exoskeleton, puffs up, and hardens as it enters the next instar. This species will sometimes eat the old exoskeleton for protein nutrition. Similar to many other Saturniidae caterpillars, the <b>imperial</b> <b>moth</b> has five instars. By the third instar, variation between caterpillars can be observed. This species is known to have two basic color forms, a black-orange form and a green-yellow form. There is also variation within those two forms on the head, spines, body, and feet. At the end of the fifth instar, the caterpillar will leave the tree and travel along the ground in search of a soft soil patch in which to pupate.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Imperial</b> Fruit Sucking <b>Moth</b> (Phyllodes imperialis) is a noctuoid moth in the Erebidae family, Calpinae subfamily. The {{species can}} be found in {{north-eastern}} Queensland to northern New South Wales, Papua New Guinea, Solomons, Vanuatu and New Caledonia.|$|R
50|$|It is 8 to 25 m tall, {{dense and}} round top, the bark is brown and fissured and smooth when young. It grows between 1300-3250 m. From 26° to 15° north latitude, from Sinaloa, Mexico to El Salvador and Honduras. It occurs within a rainfalls regime mostly in summer. A stand of about 15 fully mature Mexican <b>pines</b> is in <b>Imperial</b> County, California, at the Palo Verde County Park, {{in a narrow}} strip of land between Hwy 78 and the Colorado River.|$|R
50|$|The park {{contains}} {{thousands of}} {{species in the}} life domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. There may be over 200 fungus species in the park, including artist's fungus, black locust shelf fungus, hedge-hog fungus, hen-of-the-woods, pear-shaped puffball, and turkey-tail fungus. Its trees include ashleaf maples, American beeches, American elms, black haws, cottonwoods, eastern redbuds, eastern sycamores, princesstrees, spicebushes, trees-of-heaven, tuliptrees, and white oaks. Its spring ephemerals include spring-beauties and cutleaf toothworts. Other wildflowers in the park are asters, elephant's-foot, wingstem, and yellow jewelweed. Two native plant species that are evidently now extinct in the park are round-lobed hepatica and trailing arbutus. Both ground and climbing forms of poison-ivy are common in Glover Archbold Park. In about 2000, highly pestiferous Asian tiger mosquitoes {{first appeared in the}} park. In 2004, adult 17-year cicadas were common there. A rare harvester butterfly was seen in the park. Some of its other insects are black swallowtails, Chinese mantids, eastern carpenter bees, eastern-tailed blues, eastern tiger swallowtails, Andrena erigeniae bees, false honey ants, impatient bumblebees, <b>imperial</b> <b>moths,</b> monarchs, Peck's skippers, Pennsylvania soldier beetles, sachem skippers, silver-spotted skippers, spicebush swallowtails, spring azures, summer azures, western honey bees, and zebra swallowtails. The park has a significant invasion of nonnative plants, including Asiatic bittersweet, bamboo, common periwinkle, English ivy, garlic-mustard, gill-over-the-ground, Japanese honeysuckle, lesser celandine, wild-garlic, and wintercreeper. Once a 2-foot tall, nonnative, tropical papaya seedling grew in the stream bed. Because people have altered the park's landscape so much, native fish are no longer in the stream. Eastern box turtles, frogs, and toads are rare or extinct in the park, not to mention American black bears, American elk, bison, and timber wolves which once lived in the Washington, D.C. area. Its birds include American robins, barred owls, blue jays, Carolina wrens, catbirds, common crows, fish crows, northern cardinals, northern mockingbirds, and wood thrushes. Mammals in the park include common raccoons, coyotes, domestic cats, domestic dogs, gray foxes, humans, short-tailed shrews, Virginia opossums, white-footed mice, and white-tailed deer.|$|R
5000|$|Outside of Nachtmystium, Judd founded an {{independent}} record label, Battle Kommand Records, with Rebecca Clegg in St. Charles, Illinois. In 2005, he {{was commissioned by}} the Swedish underground label Total Holocaust Records to create the black metal [...] "supergroup" [...] Twilight. Twilight featured Wrest from Leviathan, producer Sanford Parker, Stavros Giannopoulos of The Atlas <b>Moth,</b> <b>Imperial</b> of Krieg, Malefic of Xasthur, and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth. Additionally, Judd was a session musician on Krieg's final album Blue Miasma (2006). Judd for many years performed under the pseudonym [...] "Azentrius". Also, Judd played guitar on Obscurus Advocam's 2007 album Verbia Daemonicus.|$|R
