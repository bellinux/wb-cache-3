40|$|Aim :Severe atrophies of edentulous jaws require major {{reconstructive}} bone {{surgery in}} order to allow the placement of root-form implants with standard diameter. These bone augmentation techniques represent the best option reported in the literature, but they are often rejected by patients because of their high economic and biological costs in addition to the possibility of failure in the short and/or long term. In the maxilla regenerative methods (onlay, inlay, and distraction) have high success rates, whereas in the mandible, especially in the distal atrophic area, they are not so predictable. In such situations an alternative technique for fixed prosthethic rebilitation is the insertion of <b>platform</b> <b>blade</b> implants, which have their elective indication for atrophic bone ridges with reduced width, owing to their reduced thickness. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the effectiveness of the use of piezoelectric ultrasonic handpieces, {{in order to}} simplify the placement of blade implants, making it safer and less traumatic than with conventional surgical procedures. Materials and methods: <b>Platform</b> <b>blade</b> implants are extension implant functionally and aesthetically reliable, even if they require a more difficult surgical technique compared with the one currently in use for screw implants.

40|$|AbstractA solver is {{developed}} aiming at efficiently predicting rotor noise in hover and forward flight. In this solver, the nonlinear near-field solutions are calculated by a hybrid approach {{which includes the}} Navier–Stokes and Euler equations based on a moving-embedded grid system and adaptive grid methodology. A combination of the third-order upwind scheme and flux-difference splitting scheme, instead of the second-order center-difference scheme which may cause larger wake dissipation, has been employed in the present computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The sound pressure data in the near field can be calculated directly by solving the Navier–Stokes equations, and the sound propagation can be predicted by the Kirchhoff method. A harmonic expansion approach is presented for rotor far-field noise prediction, which gives an analytical expression for the integral function in the Kirchhoff formula. As a result, the interpolation process is simplified and the efficiency and accuracy of the interpolation are improved. Then, the high-speed impulsive (HIS) noise of a helicopter rotor at different tip Mach numbers and on different observers is calculated and analyzed in hover and forward flight, which shows a highly directional characteristic of the rotor HIS noise with a maximum value in the rotor plane, and the HSI noise weakens rapidly with the increasing of the directivity angle. In order to investigate {{the effects of the}} rotor blade-tip shape on its aeroacoustic characteristics, four kinds of blade tips are designed and their noise characteristics have been simulated. At last, a new unconventional CLOR-II blade tip has been designed, and the noise characteristics of the presented CLOR-II model rotor have been simulated and measured compared to the reference rotors with a rectangular or swept-back <b>platform</b> <b>blade</b> tip. The results demonstrate that the unconventional CLOR-II blade tip can significantly reduce the HSI noise of a rotor...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work {{procedural}} fundamentals are {{developed for the}} laser remelting of single crystal turbine blades made from the nickel-base superalloy PWA 1483. Such a process aims to remove cracks in the surface layer by maintaining the single crystal structure. Single crystal repair using laser remelting requires controlled solidification conditions {{in order to prevent}} nucleation and growth of spurious grains ahead of the columnar dendritic front, i. e. to ensure epitaxial growth and to prevent the columnar to equiaxed transition. The development of the procedural fundamentals is subdivided into three steps. A laser remelting process is first developed on flat sample geometries. A process window is determined by varying all relevant process parameters. By maintaining the single crystal structure, a remelted depth up to 1. 2 mm is reached in the surface layer. The development of an overlapping strategy is used to remelt whole areas and to achieve a homogeneous remelted depth. In addition investigations are carried out to measure the emitted temperature radiation on the surface in the melt pool. In comparison to the experimental process development, heat conduction calculations based on the finite element method are carried out to determine the solidification conditions (temperature gradient, solidification velocity) and the temperature field within the melt pool. The experimental and calculated results are compared with results from previous literature. The first step is completed by remelting artificial cracks and maintaining the single crystal structure. In the second step, the developed process is transferred to complex samples with changing material thickness and curved surfaces. The measurement of the emitted temperature radiation of the surface of the melt pool is used to implement a temperature control. By using this control a nearly constant remelted depth of zm = 1 mm  0. 1 mm is achieved along the remelted track. This means that the deviation in remelted depth is decreased in comparison to laser remelting with a constant laser power. In the third step, the process is successfully applied to remelt different areas on turbine blades (<b>platform,</b> <b>blade,</b> fillet) without cracking...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{gas turbine}} engines require higher turbine-entry gas {{temperature}} {{to improve their}} thermal efficiency and thereby their performance. A major accompanying concern is the heat-up of the turbine components which are already subject to high thermal and mechanical stresses. This heat-up can be reduced by: (i) applying thermal barrier coating (TBC) on the surface, and (ii) providing coolant to the surface by injecting secondary air discharged from the compressor. However, as the bleeding off of compressor discharge air exacts a penalty on engine performance, the cooling functions must be accomplished with the smallest possible secondary air injection. This necessitates a detailed and systematic study of the various flow and geometrical parameters that may have a bearing on the cooling pattern. In the present study, experiments were performed in three regions of a non-rotating gas turbine blade cascade: blade <b>platform,</b> <b>blade</b> span, and blade tip. The blade platform and blade span {{studies were carried out}} on a high pressure turbine rotor blade cascade in medium flow conditions. Film-cooling effectiveness or degree of cooling was assessed in terms of cooling hole geometry, blowing ratio, freestream turbulence, coolant-to-mainstream density ratio, purge flow rate, upstream vortex for blade platform cooling and blowing ratio, and upstream vortex for blade span cooling. The blade tip study was performed in a blow-down flow loop in a transonic flow environment. The degree of cooling was assessed in terms of blowing ratio and tip clearance. Limited heat transfer coefficient measurements were also carried out. Mainstream pressure loss was also measured for blade platform and blade tip film-cooling with the help of pitot-static probes. The pressure sensitive paint (PSP) and temperature sensitive paint (TSP) techniques were used for measuring film-cooling effectiveness whereas for heat transfer coefficient measurement, temperature sensitive paint (TSP) technique was employed. Results indicated that the blade platform cooling requires a combination of upstream purge flow and downstream discrete film-cooling holes to cool the entire platform. The shaped cooling holes provided wider film coverage and higher film-cooling effectiveness than the cylindrical holes while also creating lesser mainstream pressure losses. Higher coolant-to-mainstream density ratio resulted in higher effectiveness levels from the cooling holes. On the blade span, at any given blowing ratio, the suction side showed better coolant coverage than the pressure side even though the former had two fewer rows of holes. Film-cooling effectiveness increased with blowing ratio {{on both sides of the}} blade. Whereas the pressure side effectiveness continued to increase with blowing ratio, the increase in suction side effectiveness slowed down at higher blowing ratios (M= 0. 9 and 1. 2). Upstream wake had a detrimental effect on film coverage. 0 % and 25 % wake phase positions significantly decreased film-cooling effectiveness magnitude. Comparison between the compound shaped hole and the compound cylindrical hole design showed higher effectiveness values for shaped holes on the suction side. The cylindrical holes performed marginally better in the curved portion of the pressure side. Finally, the concept tip proved to be better than the baseline tip in terms of reducing mainstream flow leakage and mainstream pressure loss. The film-cooling effectiveness on the concept blade increased with increasing blowing ratio and tip gap. However, the film-coverage on the leading tip portion was almost negligible...|$|E
40|$|Dry {{friction}} dampers {{are widely}} used to reduce vibration. The forced vibration response of a simplified turbine blade with {{a new kind of}} under-platform dry friction dampers is studied in this paper. The model consists of a clamped blade as two rigidly connected beams and two dampers in the form of masses which are allowed to slide along the <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> in the horizontal direction and vibrate with the <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> in the vertical direction. The horizontal and vertical vibrations of the two dampers, and the horizontal and transverse platform vibrations are coupled by friction at the contact interfaces which is assumed to follow the classical discontinuous Coulomb’s law of friction. The vertical motion of the dampers leads to time-varying contact forces and can cause horizontal stick-slip motion between the contact surfaces. Due to the relative horizontal motion between the dampers and the <b>blade</b> <b>platform,</b> the vertical contact forces and the resultant friction forces act as moving loads. The Finite Element (FE) method and Modal Superposition (MS) method are applied to solve the dynamic response, together with an algorithm that can capture nonsmooth transitions from stick to slip and slip to stick.

40|$|WO 2009098106 A 1 UPAB: 20090824 NOVELTY - The {{heating loop}} (41) {{used in the}} new turbine blade heating unit is seen to be {{generally}} U-shaped, with intentional additional curvatures. Its arrangement is such that a temperature gradient is produced in the fin section of the turbine blade (406). The loop (41) is run close to the blade, {{above and below the}} <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> (403). Above the platform (403) the loop is run near the blade and is curved to correspond with the blade curvature. The loop is curved below the <b>blade</b> <b>platform,</b> especially in correspondence with the turbine blade curvature above the <b>blade</b> <b>platform.</b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Only a single heating loop is used. It is led near the <b>blade</b> <b>platform.</b> It is passed near the turbine blade or the blade root. The heating loop is arranged on the suction- and/or pressure side of the blade. The heating unit forms part of welding equipment for a turbine blade. In the new method of welding, the heating unit is used in conjunction with welding equipment (49), especially a laser, to produce a weld seam. Welding is carried out {{on the side of the}} turbine blade where the heating loop runs below the <b>blade</b> <b>platform.</b> The weld seam is intentionally allowed to harden to a DS- or SX-orientated structure. The transition region between turbine <b>blade</b> and <b>platform</b> is welded. In the region to be heated, a powder is coated-on. This is a magnetic powder, especially a magnetic and dielectric powder. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the corresponding welding method. USE - A heating unit used when e. g. welding cracks in turbine blades or removing material from them. ADVANTAGE - Turbine blade welding e. g. re-melts and fuses cracks together, or removes material. Pre-heating precedes welding, to reduce thermally-induced stressing. In prior art, the desired temperature or temperature distribution is not achieved. The new equipment and measures described are used to overcome this problem. Use of only a single heating loop is preferred, since it represents an easily-reproducible arrangement. The magnetic and dielectric powder acts as a concentrator for the heating loop, during the heating operation. Its use masks selectively against welding. The blade is used in e. g. an aviation- or power generation gas turbine, a steam turbine or a compressor. Suitable alloys and structure are also discussed in the disclosure...|$|R

The cache consists of approximately 190 obsidian prismatic blade cores and core fragments, but the original number of cores placed in the cache likely fell between 173 and 182, with a best estimate of 177, 178, or 180. The cores were found about 20 cm southwest of the structure in a circular concentration measuring approximately 35 cm north-south by 30 cm east-west and 16 cm deep. The cache is analyzed through a lithic technology framework that focused on three phases: procurement, manufacture, and deposition. Data collection for the procurement phase consisted of sourcing the obsidian using a portable x-ray fluorescence spectrometer and obsidians from three sources in the Guatemalan highlands were found: Ixtepeque, San Martin Jilotepeque, and El Chayal. For the manufacture phase, data collection consisted of documenting core dimensions, degree and type of rejuvenation techniques, and the number and variability of <b>platforms,</b> <b>blade</b> terminations, and blade scars. This information was used to examine the prismatic blade-core technology responsible for creating this assemblage as well as to situate Nojpeten blade-core manufacturing within what is postulated for the greater Petén lakes region during the Postclassic period.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation to}} measure the effect of mainstream turbulence on <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> cooling effectiveness within a linear cascade has been completed. Turbulence grids generate the wide ranges of turbulence intensity, from 0. 72 % to 13 %. To simulate the rotating condition of engine blades, velocity triangle analogy has been adopted. Different size of inclined injection hole plates produces swirl motion of purge flow, which makes three different swirl ratios of 0. 4, 0. 6 and 1. 0.

40|$|During the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSM) HPFtP/AT {{development}} program, engine hot fire testing {{resulted in}} turbine blade fatigue cracks. The cracks were noted {{after only a}} few tests and a several hundred seconds versus the design goal of 60 tests and > 30, 000 seconds. Subsequent investigation attributed the distress to excessive steady and dynamic loads. To address these excessive turbine blade loads, Pratt & Whitney Liquid Space Propulsion engineers designed and developed retrofitable turbine <b>blade</b> to <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> featherseal dampers. Since incorporation of these dampers, along with other turbine blade system improvements, there has been no observed SSME HPFTP/AT turbine blade fatigue cracking. The high time HPFTP/AT blade now has accumulated 32 starts and 19, 200 seconds hot fire test time. Figure # 1 illustrates the HPFTP/AT turbine <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> featherseal dampers. The approached selected was to improve the turbine blade structural capability while simultaneously reducing loads. To achieve this goal, the featherseal dampers were designed to seal the <b>blade</b> to <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> gap and damp the dynamic motions. Sealing improves the steady stress margins by increasing turbine efficiency and improving turbine blade attachment thermal conditioning. Load reduction was achieved through damping. Thin Haynes 188 sheet metal was selected based on its material properties (hydrogen resistance, elongation, tensile strengths, etc.). The 36, 000 rpm wheel speed of the rotor result in a normal load of 120 #/blade. The featherseals then act as micro-slip dampers during actual SSME operation. After initial design and analysis (prior to full engine testing), the featherseal dampers were tested in P&W's spin rig facility in West Palm Beach, Florida. Both dynamic strain gages and turbine blade tip displacement measurements were utilized to quantify the featherseal damper effectiveness. Full speed (36, 000 rpm), room temperature rig testing verified the elimination of fundamental mode (i. e, modes 1 & 2) resonant response.

40|$|Friction damping {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{exploited}} systems of passive control of the vibration of mechanical systems. In order to mitigate vibration of turbine blades, friction dampers are commonly included in the bladed disk design. A common type of blade-to-blade friction dampers are the so-called underplatform dampers (UPDs); these are metal devices placed under the <b>blade</b> <b>platforms</b> and held in contact with them by the centrifugal force acting during rotation. The effectiveness of UPDs to dissipate energy by friction and reduce vibration amplitude depends mostly on the damper geometry and material and on the static loads pressing the damper against the <b>blade</b> <b>platforms.</b> The common procedure used to estimate the static loads acting on UPDs consists in decoupling the static and the dynamic balance of the damper. A preliminary static analysis of the contact is performed in order to compute the static pressure distribution over the damper/blade interfaces, assuming that it does not change when vibration occurs. In this paper a coupled approach is proposed. The static and the dynamic displacements of blade and UPD are coupled together during the forced response calculation. Both the primary structure (the bladed disk) and the secondary structure (the damper) are modeled by finite elements and linked together by contact elements, allowing for stick, slip and lift off states, placed between each pair of contact nodes, by using a refined version of the state-of-the-art friction contact model. In order to model accurately the blade/damper contact with a large number of contact nodes without increasing proportionally the size of the set of nonlinear equations to be solved, damper and blade dynamics are modeled by linear superposition of a truncated series of normal modes.

Film cooling effectiveness distributions were obtained on a turbine <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> within a linear cascade with upstream slot injection.

The vibration of the beams enforce a local node of zero vibratory amplitude at the interface between the supports and the beam. The vibration of the beams create forces upon the supports which forces are transmitted through the rotor <b>blade</b> mounting <b>platform</b> to the base of each rotor blade. When these forces attain a predetermined design frequency and magnitude and are directed {{to the base of the}} rotor blades, vibration of the rotor blades is effectively counteracted...|$|R
40|$|Secondary flows {{near the}} endwall of a turbine blade {{contribute}} to a loss in aerodynamic performance in the engine. Further reductions in performance occur when the secondary flows interact with leakage flow from necessary clearance features, such as the clearance gap between the blade rotor and an upstream stator or gaps between adjacent <b>blade</b> <b>platforms.</b> Non-axisymmetric endwall contouring {{has been shown to}} reduce the strength of secondary flows near the endwall, but relatively little research has been done to test the sensitivity of the contouring to the endwall leakage features. This paper describes aerodynamic measurements taken downstream of a cascade with representative leakage features. In general, upstream leakage flow with swirl relative to the blade increased aerodynamic loss, relative to leakage that was matched to the blade wheelspeed. Non-axisymmetric contouring for an endwall without a platform gap reduced underturning of the flow but had no effect on overall loss, relative to a flat endwall without a gap. A contoured endwall with a platform gap had 12 % higher mixed-out loss than a contoured endwall without a gap...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} use of renewable energy sources, Gas Turbines (GTs) are currently required to accomplish more flexible operations for supplying the back-up energy. As a result, thermo-mechanical fatigue issues in the GTs components are emphasized. In this paper, the design of a novel rig for assessing the fatigue behavior in the trailing edge of full scale GTs blades is presented. Based on a detailed Finite Element (FE) analysis of the blade response under thermo-mechanical loads, it is demonstrated that the stress and strain cycles arising in this area during a start-up/shut-down transient can be accurately reproduced by clamping the blade in the shank zone and applying a transversal load to the trailing edge. It is also shown that the stress/strain states can be obtained using a Test Article (TA) extracted from the actual blade. In this configuration, the load magnitude and direction, and the distance of the application point from the <b>blade</b> <b>platform</b> are the test control parameters. A FE model simulating the TA test is developed to determine the test parameters. A tooling for clamping and loading the TA is finally proposed along with a rig apparatus consisting of standard equipment used in material testing...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{an effort}} to reduce the blade tip {{clearance}} leakage in turbine designs, this article aims to numerically investigate the effects of active jet-flow injected from the <b>blade</b> tip <b>platform</b> upon the <b>blade</b> tip clearance flow. A CFD code integrated with dense-correction-based 3 D Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations together with the well-proven Reynolds stress model (RSM) is adopted. The variation of specific heat is taken into consideration. The effects of jet-flow on the tip clearance flow are simulated at two tip clearance heights, each with five differently located injection holes and three jet-flow mass rates. In this way, the article elucidates the mechanism of active injection control, analyzes the topological tip clearance flow structure, and, finally, calculates the turbine efficiency considering the effects of the jet-flow. The results show that the mass rate of the third jet-flow turn to be the optimum in maximizing the turbine efficiency. The jet-flows through combined holes could increase the efficiency by 0. 35 % with loose tip clearance, and by 0. 3 % with tight tip clearance. The number of saddle points is equal to that of nodes near the injection hole, which satisfies the singularity point distribution law...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the asymmetry of thermal conditions during directional solidification, the temperature evolution and correspondingly developed undercooling in a simplified single crystal blade cluster were numerically simulated. Simulation results demonstrate that the temperature distribution at the <b>blade</b> <b>platforms</b> is obviously asymmetrical. On {{the outside of the}} blade which directly faces the heating element, the liquidus (TL) isotherms progress relatively smoothly. On the inside of the blades facing the central rod, however, the TL-isotherms are in concave shape and the slope goes upwards to the platform extremities. The average undercooling extent ΔT and undercooling time Δt at the inside are much higher than those at the outside. It was then predicted that the inside platform extremities have significantly higher probabilities of stray grain formation compared to the outside ones. A corresponding experiment was carried out and the metallographic examination exhibited the same side- and height-dependence of stray grain formation in the blades as predicted. On the inside of the <b>blades,</b> all <b>platforms</b> are occupied by stray grains, while the platforms on the outside are nearly stray grain free. The simulation result agrees very well with the experimental observation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{flexible}} friction dampers (or "strips") {{mounted on the}} underside of adjacent turbine <b>blade</b> <b>platforms</b> for sealing and damping purposes. A key parameter to ensure a robust and trustworthy design is the correct prediction of the maximum frequency shift induced by the strip damper coupling adjacent blades. While this topic has been extensively addressed on rigid friction dampers, both experimentally and numerically, no such investigation is available as far as flexible dampers are concerned. This paper builds on the authors' prior experience with rigid dampers to investigate the peculiarities and challenges of a robust dynamic model of blade-strips systems. The starting point is a numerical tool implementing state-of-the-art techniques for the efficient solution of the nonlinear equations, e. g., multi-harmonic balance method with coupled static solution and state-of-the-art contact elements. The full step-by-step modelling process is here retraced and upgraded {{to take into account the}} damper flexibility: for each step, key modelling choices (e. g., mesh size, master nodes selection, contact parameters) which may affect the predicted response are addressed. The outcome is a series of guidelines which will help the designer assign numerical predictions the proper level of trust and outline a much-needed experimental campaign...|$|R
