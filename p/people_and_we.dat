He finished his first research paper in his freshman year, {{which was published}} in the Taiwanese Medical Magazine (台灣醫學雜誌). After graduating in 1940, Lee decided to quit clinical medicine and keep on studying. He became the assistant of Tsungming Tu, who was researching on basic medical studies and, at the time, the only Taiwanese professors in the medical department.

Al-Ekri was well known in Bahrain previous to the uprising for a January 2009 trip to the Gaza Strip to provide aid to Palestinians during the Gaza War. On his return, he received a number of awards, including one from the king. After his arrest, Al-Ekri stated {{that he was being}} persecuted for his comments to the media about police violence: [...] "They know we witnessed all the crimes of the regime and we stood strong by injured <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> talked to the media ...

Arsenal's self-sustaining model relied heavily on qualifying for the UEFA Champions League; as Wenger recalled in 2016: [...] "We had to be {{three years in the}} Champions League out of five and have an average of 54,000 <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> didn’t know we would be capable of that." [...] The club sold several experienced players throughout the late 2000s and early 2010s and raised ticket prices, upsetting supporters who have called for change. Wenger took umbrage over criticism and revealed the bank loans were contingent on his commitment to the club: [...] "The banks wanted the technical consistency to guarantee that {{we have a chance to}} pay [...] back. I did commit and I stayed and under very difficult circumstances. So for me to come back and on top of that [...] reproach me for not having won the championship during that period it is a bit overboard." [...] Wenger later described the stadium move as the toughest period of his life because of the restricted finances in place.|$|E

He suggested barring corporations and unions from making direct campaign contributions, expressed satisfaction with Mitt Romney's moderate brand of Republicanism, and suggested that the party should soften its stance on illegal immigration and reach out to Latino voters: [...] "We need a secure border for lots of reasons, and {{then we need to}} recognize that we're not going to deport 12 million <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> shouldn't." ...|$|E

The Predator debuted at number one on both the pop and R charts, the first album in history to do so.
