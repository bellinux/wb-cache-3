5|$|Polymers {{exhibit the}} same {{stability}} increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of polyethylene with structural unit , demonstrates this change as expected, but its very {{high melting point}} {{makes it difficult to}} mold. Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with trifluoromethyl groups, perfluoroalkoxy alkanes do the same with trifluoromethoxy groups, and Nafion contains perfluoroether side chains capped with sulfonic acid groups. Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.|$|E
25|$|Other {{ferroelectric}} {{materials used}} include triglycine sulfate, <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> (PVDF) and lithium tantalate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyvinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> (PVDF): PVDF {{exhibits}} piezoelectricity {{several times}} greater than quartz. Unlike ceramics, where the crystal structure of the material creates the piezoelectric effect, in polymers the intertwined long-chain molecules attract and repel each other when an electric field is applied.|$|E
25|$|At the FPD 2008 exhibition, Japanese company Soken {{demonstrated}} a wall with electronic wall-paper using this technology. In 2007, the Estonian company Visitret Displays is developing {{this kind of}} displays using <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> (PVDF) as the material for spheres, dramatically improving the video speed and decreasing the control voltage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyvinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> (PVDF) has a {{very high}} {{permittivity}} of 18 to 20, which allows large amounts of energy to be stored in a small space (volumetric efficiency). However, it has a Curie temperature of only 60nbsp&°C, which limits its usability. Film capacitors with PVDF are described for one very special application, in portable defibrillators.|$|E
25|$|Creep {{can cause}} gradual {{cut-through}} of wire insulation, especially when stress is concentrated by pressing insulated wire against a sharp edge or corner. Special creep-resistant insulations such as Kynar (<b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>fluoride)</b> {{are used in}} wirewrap applications to resist cut-through due to the sharp corners of wire wrap terminals. Teflon insulation is resistant to elevated temperatures and has other desirable properties, but is notoriously vulnerable to cold-flow cut-through failures caused by creep.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of ozone, only a few materials may be used like stainless steel (quality 316L), titanium, aluminium (as long as no moisture is present), glass, polytetrafluorethylene, or <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>fluoride.</b> Viton may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). Hypalon may be used with the restriction that no water {{come in contact with}} it, except for normal atmospheric levels. Embrittlement or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone. Ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like O-rings.|$|E
25|$|Besides the above-described films ((Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene Terephthalate Polyester PET), Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS), Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN), Polycarbonate (PP), Polystyrene (PS) and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)), {{some other}} plastic {{materials}} {{may be used}} as the dielectric in film capacitors. Thermoplastic polymers such as Polyimide (PI), Polyamide (PA, better known as Nylon or Perlon), <b>Polyvinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> (PVDF), Siloxane, Polysulfone (PEx) and Aromatic Polyester (FPE) are described in the technical literature as possible dielectric films for capacitors. The primary reason for considering new film materials for capacitors is the relative low permittivity of commonly used materials. With a higher permittivity, film capacitors could be made even smaller, an advantage in the market for more-compact portable electronic devices.|$|E
2500|$|Polymeric organofluorine {{compounds}} {{are numerous}} and commercially significant. They range from fully fluorinated species, e.g. PTFE to partially fluorinated, e.g. <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> (n) and polychlorotrifluoroethylene (n). [...] The fluoropolymer polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE/Teflon) is a solid.|$|E
2500|$|As a salt, its {{dominant}} use is as an emulsifier for the {{emulsion polymerization}} of fluoropolymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, or Teflon), <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>fluoride,</b> and fluoroelastomers. For this use, 3M subsidiary Dyneon has a replacement emulsifer despite DuPont stating PFOA is an [...] "essential processing aid". PFOA {{is used in}} the production of Gore-Tex as it is PTFE-based. In PTFE processing, PFOA is in aqueous solution and forms micelles that contain tetrafluoroethylene and the growing polymer. PFOA can be used to stabilize fluoropolymer and fluoroelastomer suspensions before further industrial processing and in ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography it can act as an extraction agent. PFOA also finds uses in electronic products and as an industrial fluorosurfactant.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{filtration}} in a winery can {{be classified}} as either the coarser depth filtration or the finer surface filtration. In depth filtration, often done after fermentation, the wine is pushed through {{a thick layer of}} pads made from cellulose fibers, diatomaceous earth, or perlite. [...] In surface filtration, the wine passes through a thin membrane. Running the wine parallel to the filter surface, known as cross-flow filtration, will minimize the filter clogging. The finest surface filtration, microfiltration, can sterilize the wine by trapping all yeast and, optionally, bacteria, and so is often done immediately prior to bottling. An absolute rated filter of 0.45µm is generally considered to result in a microbially stable wine and is accomplished by the use of membrane cartridges, most commonly <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> (PVDF). Certain red wines may be filtered to 0.65µm, to remove yeast, or to 1.0µm to remove viable brettanomyces only.|$|E
2500|$|One way to {{directly}} convert waste heat into electricity is by executing the Olsen cycle on pyroelectric materials. The Olsen cycle {{consists of two}} isothermal and two isoelectric field processes in the electric displacement-electric field (D-E) diagram. The principle of the Olsen cycle is to charge a capacitor via cooling under low electric field and to discharge it under heating at higher electric field. Several pyroelectric converters {{have been developed to}} implement the Olsen cycle using conduction, convection, or radiation. It has also been established theoretically that pyroelectric conversion based on heat regeneration using an oscillating working fluid and the Olsen cycle can reach Carnot efficiency between a hot and a cold thermal reservoir. Moreover, recent studies have established <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>fluoride</b> trifluoroethylene [...] polymers and lead lanthanum zirconate titanate (PLZT) ceramics as promising pyroelectric materials to use in energy converters due to their large energy densities generated at low temperatures. Additionally, a pyroelectric scavenging device that does not require time-varying inputs was recently introduced. The energy-harvesting device uses the edge-depolarizing electric field of a heated pyroelectric to convert heat energy into mechanical energy instead of drawing electric current off two plates attached to the crystal-faces.|$|E

50|$|After the {{discovery}} of PVDF, many other polymers have been sought after that contain ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric properties.

Dual-wall stainless steel tubing is most commonly used in semiconductor plants for the containment of highly toxic gases.|$|E
50|$|Lithium polymer {{cells have}} evolved from {{lithium-ion}} and lithium-metal batteries. The primary {{difference is that}} instead of using a liquid lithium-salt electrolyte (such as LiPF6) held in an organic solvent (such as EC/DMC/DEC), the battery uses a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) or <b>poly(vinylidene</b> <b>fluoride)</b> (PVdF).|$|E
