The original West End production closed in July 2011 after a five-year run, prior to a two-year national tour.

5|$|Fillmore sent {{a special}} message to Congress on August 6, 1850, {{disclosing}} {{the letter from}} Governor Bell and his reply, warning that armed Texans would be viewed as intruders, and urging Congress to defuse sectional tensions by passing the Compromise. Without the Great Triumvirate of John C. Calhoun, Webster and Clay who had long dominated the Senate, Douglas and others led that body towards the administration-backed package of bills. Each bill passed the Senate {{with the support of}} the section that wanted it, <b>plus</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> members who were determined to see all the bills passed. The battle then moved to the House, which had a Northern majority because of population. Most contentious was the Fugitive Slave Bill, whose provisions were anathema to abolitionists. Fillmore applied pressure to get Northern Whigs to abstain rather than oppose, including New Yorkers—threatening to kill the renomination of Congressman Abraham Schermerhorn of Rochester, whose constituents included Frederick Douglass, if he voted against the bill. Through the legislative process, various changes were made, including the setting of a boundary between New Mexico Territory and Texas—the state would be given a payment to settle any claims. California was admitted as a free state, the District slave trade was ended, and the final status of slavery in New Mexico and Utah would be settled later. Fillmore signed the bills as they reached his desk, holding the Fugitive Slave Bill for two days until he received a favorable opinion as to its constitutionality from the new Attorney General, John J. Crittenden. Although some Northerners were unhappy at the Fugitive Slave Act, relief was widespread, as was the hope this would settle the slavery question.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Answering fixed-radius nearest {{neighbor}} queries constitutes an important problem in many areas, ranging from geographic systems to similarity searching in object databases (e. g. image and video databases). The usual approach {{in order to}} efficiently answer such queries is to construct an index. In this paper we present algorithms for constructing a multidimensional quad-tree index. We start with well-known sequential algorithms and then adapt them to the MapReduce computation model, {{in order to be}} able to handle large amounts of data. In all the algorithms the objects are indexed in association with quad-tree cells (or nodes) which they intersect (<b>plus</b> possibly <b>a</b> <b>few</b> other nearby cells). When processing a query, multiple quad-tree cells may be searched in order to find the answer...|$|R
