In this paper studied the problem of testing hypotheses about two <b>population</b> <b>means</b> are not using the assumption of normality and homogeneity. The method used to test hypotheses about two <b>population</b> <b>means</b> are the bootstrap method. The basic idea of the bootstrap method of repeated sampling with replacement from the sample data. Replication of samples used to determine the point estimator of Achieved Significance Level (ASL). Performance of the bootstrap method was tested using simulated data. The test results show that the bootstrap method to test the hypothesis of two <b>population</b> <b>means</b> well.

Finally, <b>population</b> <b>means</b> for fruit set per plant varied from 0.14 to 0.59 in 2010 and 0.19 to 0.57 in 2011. All {{measured}} traits differed significantly among populations {{within the same}} year (P[*]<[*] 0.001; all variables except fruit set were log-transformed). All correlations were conducted using these log-transformed variables, where applicable.|$|R
30|$|To {{understand}} {{the effects of}} <b>population</b> size and <b>mean</b> <b>population</b> density, we first calculated the <b>population</b> <b>means</b> of leaf number per plant (plant size), flower number per plant, fruit number per plant, and fruit set (fruits/flowers) per plant, in both 2010 and 2011. We first used linear regression analysis to evaluate the effects of <b>population</b> size and <b>mean</b> <b>population</b> density on <b>mean</b> <b>population</b> fruit number or fruit set for each year separately. Because the <b>population</b> <b>means</b> of plant size were highly correlated with <b>mean</b> <b>population</b> flower number (2010 : rp[*]=[*] 0.865, P[*]<[*] 0.001, n[*]=[*] 34; 2011 : rp[*]=[*] 0.861, P[*]<[*] 0.001, n[*]=[*] 35), fruit number (2010 : rp[*]=[*] 0.782, P[*]<[*] 0.001, n[*]=[*] 34; 2011 : rp[*]=[*] 0.709, P[*]<[*] 0.001, n[*]=[*] 35) and fruit set in 2010 (rp[*]=[*] 0.583, P[*]<[*] 0.001, n[*]=[*] 34), we used a multiple regression analysis to analyze whether <b>population</b> size and <b>mean</b> <b>population</b> density had an influence on <b>mean</b> <b>population</b> fruit number in 2010 and 2011 or on fruit set in 2010, when accounting for <b>mean</b> <b>population</b> plant size. All variables except <b>mean</b> <b>population</b> fruit set were natural-log-transformed to stabilize variances. For all analyses, we examined the residuals for departures from normality (Shapiro-Wilk test).|$|R
5|$|Estimates of the European {{population}} of the European nightjar range from 470,000 to more than 1million birds, suggesting a total global {{population of}} 2–6million individuals. Although {{there appears to be}} a fall in numbers, it is not rapid enough to trigger the vulnerability criteria. The huge breeding range and <b>population</b> <b>mean</b> that this species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} breeds in coniferous woodland and gardens, {{building its}} compact, three-layered nest {{on a tree}} branch. Ten to twelve eggs are incubated by the female alone, and the chicks are fed by both parents; second broods are common. This kinglet is constantly on the move as it searches for insects to eat, and in winter it is often found with flocks of tits. It may be killed by birds of prey or carry parasites, but its large range and <b>population</b> <b>mean</b> {{that it is not}} considered to present any significant conservation concerns.|$|E
5|$|This martin nests under a cliff {{overhang}} or on {{a man-made}} structure, building a neat half-cup mud nest {{with a soft}} lining. Both adults incubate the two to four eggs and feed the chicks. This species does not form large breeding colonies, {{but it is more}} gregarious outside the breeding season. It feeds a wide variety of insects that are caught as the martin flies near to cliff faces. It may be hunted by large bats as well as birds of prey, but its extensive and expanding range and large <b>population</b> <b>mean</b> that there are no significant conservation concerns.|$|E

5|$|Bird {{species with}} a {{restricted}} range {{are especially vulnerable}} to human activities, and eight of the 26 bird species occurring only in the Northern Maluku Endemic Bird Area are threatened, including the invisible rail. Almost {{a quarter of all}} rail species have conservation concerns, and flightless island species are particularly at risk, at least 15 species having become extinct since 1600. The estimated population of the invisible rail is 3,500–15,000 birds, and its restricted range and small <b>population</b> <b>mean</b> that the species is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although this rail is so poorly known that it may be more common than the estimates suggest.|$|E
5|$|A smallish crake, the African crake has brown-streaked blackish upperparts, bluish-grey underparts and {{black-and-white}} barring on {{the flanks}} and belly. It has a stubby red bill, red eyes, {{and a white}} line from the bill to above the eye. It is smaller than its closest relative, the corn crake; that species is also lighter-plumaged, and has an eye stripe. The African crake has a range of calls, the most characteristic being a series of rapid grating krrr notes. It is active during the day, and is territorial on both the breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male has a threat display, and may fight at territory boundaries. The nest is a shallow cup of grass leaves built in a depression under a grass tussock or small bush. The 3–11 eggs start hatching after about 14 days, and the black, downy precocial chicks fledge after four to five weeks. The African crake feeds {{on a wide range}} of invertebrates, along with some small frogs and fish, and plant material, especially grass seeds. It may itself be eaten by large birds of prey; snakes; or mammals, including humans, and can host parasites. Although it may be displaced temporarily by the burning of grassland, or permanently by agriculture, wetland drainage or urbanisation, its large range and <b>population</b> <b>mean</b> that it is not considered to be threatened.|$|E
5|$|The Australian raven can {{be found}} in a wide range of natural and {{modified}} habitats. It requires available water and trees (or buildings) to roost in or perch on. Preferred habitats include eucalypt-dominated sclerophyll forest, and farmland adjacent to trees. It is also found in heath and mangroves. In areas where it occurs with the little raven, namely over much of central New South Wales, Victoria and into South Australia, the Australian raven is restricted to more forested areas while the latter species prefers more open areas. Similarly, in inland Australia it can share range with the little crow, as the two do not appear to compete. However, the ranges of similar-sized forest raven and Torresian crow only narrowly overlap with the Australian raven as all three compete with each other. In central and western regions, Australian ravens and Torresian crows vie for the scattered uncommon trees and outcrops, and only one or the other are found there. It co-occurs with the forest raven in northeastern New South Wales from Port Stephens northwards. The Australian raven has adapted very well to human habitation in some cities and is the most common corvid in Canberra, Sydney and Perth; in Melbourne and Adelaide it is replaced by the little raven, and by the Torresian crow in Brisbane. Its large range, abundance and increasing <b>population</b> <b>mean</b> it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{estimation}} of variance in repeated samples of size one from different populations ordered in time, when the <b>population</b> <b>means</b> are potentially changing, has been explored. Five models covering a variety of circumstances were considered. Method of moments, maximum likelihood and Bayesian techniques were used to derive estimators. Some estimators robust to unknown changes in <b>population</b> <b>means</b> were identified...|$|R
25|$|For {{a finite}} population, the <b>population</b> <b>mean</b> of a {{property}} {{is equal to}} the arithmetic mean of the given property while considering every member of the population. For example, the <b>population</b> <b>mean</b> height {{is equal to the}} sum of the heights of every individual divided {{by the total number of}} individuals. The sample mean may differ from the <b>population</b> <b>mean,</b> especially for small samples. The law of large numbers dictates that the larger the size of the sample, the more likely it is that the sample mean will be close to the <b>population</b> <b>mean.</b>|$|E
25|$|Standard {{deviation}} {{refers to}} the extent to which individual observations in a sample differ from a central value, such as the sample or <b>population</b> <b>mean,</b> while Standard error refers to an estimate of difference between sample mean and <b>population</b> <b>mean.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 95% interval, {{is often}} {{estimated}} by assuming a normal {{distribution of the}} measured parameter, in which case it {{can be defined as}} the interval limited by 1.96 (often rounded up to 2) population standard deviations from either side of the <b>population</b> <b>mean</b> (also called the expected value).|$|E
50|$|Once t and '''' {{have been}} computed, these {{statistics}} {{can be used}} with the t-distribution to test the null hypothesis that the two <b>population</b> <b>means</b> are equal (using a two-tailed test), or the alternative hypothesis that one of the <b>population</b> <b>means</b> is {{greater than or equal to}} the other (using a one-tailed test).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the power function}} of the Studentised range test for comparing the <b>means</b> of normal <b>populations</b> in the one-way fixed effects analysis of variance model. The main results provide rigorous proofs of certain least favourable configurations of <b>population</b> <b>means.</b> These results are important in the calculation of the sample sizes required to guarantee power levels under certain restrictions on the ranges of the <b>population</b> <b>means...</b>|$|R
25|$|Therefore, the {{variance}} of the mean {{of a large number}} of standardized variables is approximately equal to their average correlation. This makes clear that the sample mean of correlated variables does not generally converge to the <b>population</b> <b>mean,</b> even though the law of large numbers states that the sample mean will converge for independent variables.|$|E
25|$|For example, if {{one makes}} the {{parametric}} {{assumption that the}} underlying distribution is a normal distribution, and has a sample set {X1,...,X'n}, then confidence intervals and credible intervals {{may be used to}} estimate the <b>population</b> <b>mean</b> μ and population standard deviation σ of the underlying population, while prediction intervals may be used to estimate the value of the next sample variable, X'n+1.|$|E
25|$|If {{the test}} {{statistic}} follows a Student's t-distribution in {{the null hypothesis}} – which is common where the underlying variable follows a normal distribution with unknown scaling factor, then the test {{is referred to as}} a one-tailed or two-tailed t-test. If the test is performed using the actual <b>population</b> <b>mean</b> and variance, rather than an estimate from a sample, it would be called a one-tailed or two-tailed Z-test.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the null}} {{hypothesis}} of no difference between <b>population</b> <b>means</b> (and assuming that standard ANOVA regularity assumptions are satisfied) the sums of squares have scaled chi-squared distributions, with the corresponding degrees of freedom. The F-test statistic is the ratio, after scaling by the degrees of freedom.

25|$|Prediction {{intervals}} {{are used}} in both frequentist statistics and Bayesian statistics: a prediction interval bears the same relationship to a future observation that a frequentist confidence interval or Bayesian credible interval bears to an unobservable population parameter: prediction intervals predict the distribution of individual future points, whereas confidence intervals and credible intervals of parameters predict the distribution of estimates of the true <b>population</b> <b>mean</b> or other quantity of interest that cannot be observed.|$|E
25|$|Statistical theory studies {{decision}} {{problems such}} as minimizing the risk (expected loss) of a statistical action, such as using a procedure in, for example, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and selecting the best. In these traditional areas of mathematical statistics, a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an objective function, like expected loss or cost, under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a <b>population</b> <b>mean</b> with a given level of confidence. Because of its use of optimization, the mathematical theory of statistics shares concerns with other decision sciences, such as operations research, control theory, and mathematical economics.|$|E
25|$|Tarebia granifera is both {{parthenogenetic}} and ovoviviparous, although {{males have}} been reported. These are characteristics which are undoubtedly key to its success as an invader.

Males were found in most (6/7) populations examined in Puerto Rico but were generally uncommon at up to 22.7% of the <b>population</b> (<b>mean</b> 4.6%). Live sperm were present in the testes of these males but the genitalia were apparently non-functional. R.
