5|$|An {{elaborate}} bureaucracy {{was created}} to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods {{with the intention of}} eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 <b>percent</b> <b>return</b> on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would {{be turned over to the}} Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E

40|$|In 2010, President Obama signed The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which {{requires}} financially based {{government agencies and}} 35 major US banks to monitor systemic risk. This {{was in response to}} the recent near financial collapse due to major mistakes made by organizations generally considered 2 ̆ 2 too big to fail 2 ̆ 2. Systemic risk is the risk of the collapse of an entire financial system or market. It refers to the risks imposed by interdependencies in a system or market, where the failure of a single entity or cluster of entities can cause a cascading failure. In April 2011, the Global Financial Stability Report, written by the International Monetary Fund, stated that Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) could cause financial stability risks if prices were to decline for an extended time. In order to monitor systemic risk, daily historical ETF price data was collected for 1172 ETFs dating back to 1993. Using the programming language R, <b>percent</b> <b>returns</b> on that data were calculated for one, three, five, and ten days in the future for every date. Also using R, linear and quadratic regression analysis was done on the ETF prices and <b>percent</b> <b>returns</b> in three and five day increments. The slopes of the regression lines, prices, and <b>percent</b> <b>returns</b> will be analyzed to see if they correlate in the hope of finding short term patterns that may predict what occurs next. A program called the Anomalator, which analyzes typical patterns and detects atypical occurrences worthy of inspection, will be used with the datasets created to potentially detect problems in the financial market before they happen...|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, a new {{generation}} of low-budget film companies emerged that drew from all the different lines of exploitation as well as the sci-fi and teen themes that had been a mainstay since the 1950s. Operations such as Roger Corman's New World Pictures, Cannon Films, New Line Cinema, Film Ventures International, Fanfare Films, and Independent-International Pictures brought exploitation films to mainstream theaters around the country. The major studios' top product was continuing to inflate in running time—in 1970, the ten biggest earners averaged 140.1 minutes. The B's were keeping pace: In 1955, Corman had a producorial hand in five movies averaging 74.8 minutes, with a range between 69 and 79. He played a similar part in five films originally released in 1970, two for AIP and three for his own New World, including an Italian horror film that he purchased for around $25,000: the average length was 89.8 minutes, with a range between 86 and 94. These films could turn a tidy profit. The first New World release, the biker movie Angels Die Hard, cost $117,000 to produce. It was no Easy Rider, but its box-office take of $2 million–plus meant a 46 <b>percent</b> <b>return</b> for New World's investors.|$|E
500|$|A {{committee}} was appointed in 1870 {{to consider the}} railway, and was followed by on-site investigations to determine the railway's route. Similar investigations were carried out in Sweden. For the Norwegian side, costs were estimated to be at 4.7 million Norwegian kroner. for the Meråker route. Surveys along the Verdal route deemed the route unsuitable. This presumed a narrow gauge (...) railway, common in Norway at the time. Operating profits were estimated to give a 4.5 <b>percent</b> <b>return</b> on capital. Shares in the railway company were offered for sale in 1871; the largest purchaser was Trondheim Municipality, who bought shares for 1.2 million kroner. In Trondheim alone, private investors bought an additional 3.6 million kroner in shares.|$|E
500|$|At {{the centre}} of Great Southern's {{operations}} were management investment schemes (referred to as MIS schemes). MIS schemes are a mechanism by which investors' funds are pooled {{to invest in a}} common business enterprise. A [...] "responsible entity" [...] (such as Great Southern) controls the routine administration of the investments. In primary production schemes such as those managed by Great Southern, investors are the growers of products (such as forestry plantations), with an agreement with the company to manage the investment [...] "to plant, establish and maintain the trees until they are harvested at maturity". Investors in Great Southern generally purchased lots (typically of 1 hectare) on land owned or leased by Great Southern. Thus investors owned the plantations, but the land assets belonged to the company. While investors owned individual woodlots, risks and returns were distributed across all investors in individual projects, with growers sharing [...] "the average yield at harvest for the entire Project...rather than the return from their individual woodlot". These were not high rates of return for the length of investment involved. Some of the schemes relied upon the rationale that investors would retire and therefore receive income from the scheme when their marginal tax rate was lower than at the time of initial investment. Based on this premise some schemes were claiming a rate of return after tax of eight to nine percent. Others suggested the schemes were a poor investment likely to achieve only six <b>percent</b> <b>return.</b>|$|E

Also in 1987, he a wrote a never-cashed investment check for $10,000 to Christopher Whittle for shares in Whittle Communications that increased in value to $330,000.

Alexander's wife obtained an $133,000 profit from her $8,900 investment in a company created to privatize prisons. Alexander frequently shifted assets to his wife's name, yet such transfers are not legal under federal ethics and security laws. [...] In his 2005 US Senate financial disclosure report, he listed personal ownership of BFAM (Bright Horizons Family Solutions) stock valued (at that time) between $1million and $5million.

40|$|To improve followup and {{treatment}} of patients with streptococcal sore throat at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center, New York City, a simple and inexpensive method was devised for recalling and treating untreated patients with positive throat cultures and culturing household contacts.

The secretary sent notification letters to all patients with positive cultures urging them to return for treatment and emphasizing the need for their contacts to come for screening. The secretary, trained in the throat culturing technique, also performed the laboratory work on the cultures from contacts. The clinic nurse swabbed the throats of all contacts and administered treatment, according to a standing-order protocol, to all with culture-proved streptococcal sore throat. A comparison of initially untreated patients with positive cultures seen 3 months before and 6 months after the program was started revealed that 46 <b>percent</b> <b>returned</b> for treatment after the notification letter was sent; before the program only 21 <b>percent</b> <b>returned</b> for treatment.
