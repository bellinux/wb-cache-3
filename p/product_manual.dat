40|$|When {{consumers}} {{are in need}} of help concerning how to use electrical equipment they immediately take a quick look at household <b>product</b> <b>manuals.</b> Generally, household consumer <b>product</b> <b>manuals</b> contain a contents section and there are other sections such as safety rules, technical features, the use of the product, the use of the accessories, maintenance and cleaning. <b>Product</b> <b>manuals</b> are desig-ned for a specific reader with the aim of giving the needed information. Thus, they can be thought as representing a register of their own. In order to understand these registers there are three contextu-al parameters which are field, tenor and mode variables. Field of discourse refers to the subject and focus of interaction. Tenor of discourse marks the relationship between the interactants. Mode of discourse refers to spoken or written interaction. These three contextual parameters are represented through three meanings; ideational, interpersonal and textual. Concerning the linguistic analysis of the study, Halliday’s systemic functional grammar is applied to operational manuals. The linguis-tic analysis concerns 3 meanings: ideational, interpersonal and textual.

40|$|Abstract: Intelligent product manuals are {{designed}} to allow product users to utilize a product as easily, e€ectively and with as little additional care as possible while minimizing support costs for manufacturers and suppliers.

40|$|Product cues {{have been}} {{identified}} as a major factor and are used by customers when they evaluate a product before deciding to buy. Customers evaluate products based on the <b>product</b> <b>manual</b> cues; generally, they use the brand, design and price, and produce quality perception and ceases on purchase intentions. This process also occurs in the prospective buyer's sport shoes X that have the largest sales in Indonesia. Therefore, the researchers are interested to test whether there is a relationship between the product cues on the quality perception and purchase intention for sports footwear products. This research was done by using a survey for the data collection, by distributing the questionnaires to 161 respondents.

40|$|Issue: Recovered {{wood waste}} {{frequently}} contains non-wood contaminants that escape traditional contaminant removal systems. These pervasive contaminants {{might be a}} problem for the end user’s manufacturing process. Furthermore, they devalue the marketability of the resulting feedstocks. Screening techniques might not be effective because of dimensional similarities with the acceptable <b>product.</b> <b>Manual</b> sorting techniques might be ineffective and labor extensive. To produce the cleanest product, a processing facility must maintain a series of contaminant removal systems that are capable of effectively removing the contaminants. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends the use of equipment that separates materials according to differences in density. This type of equipment is typically referred to as an “air density separator ” or an “air knife. ” The air density separators are effective at removing heavier (e. g., rocks, metals, glass) or lighter (e. g., paper, light plastic, Styrofoam®) materials than the recovered wood waste material. The equipment could also sort materials according to differences in particle size using air resistance characteristics. An air density separator is typically preceded in the process by a pre-screening equipment that removes over-sized wood and contaminants, as well as, fine materials. The equipment could reduce sorting error...|$|E
