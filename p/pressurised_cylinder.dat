To conform to the safety maintenance requirements of Australian Standards, these models were superseded subsequently by unpressurised systems emitting minimal steam. By 1975, Zip complemented its early over-sink boiling water heaters with its first on-wall instant boiling water heaters with enhanced energy efficiency and an increased capacity measured in number of cups of boiling water per hour. These were followed closely {{by the introduction of}} the Zip Miniboil, the first truly small on-wall instant boiling water heater.

Modulated release of ethylene {{gas from the}} IC powder was achieved by admixture with deliquescent salt CaCl 2 at RHs of 75. 5 % and 93. 6 %. The IC powder was tested in the laboratory and for in-transit ripening of mango fruit over two seasons. In the laboratory experiment, ethylene gas started to release from the IC powder in 2 h and complete release was achieved in 24 h.

40|$|Damage Tolerance of {{aircraft}} fuselage structures {{has a strong}} link to explosion resistance. Though accidental explosions can and do occur, intentional explosions are more common as the terrorist threat increases. Structural toughness is as welcome in these scenarios as it is under penetration of non contained engine debris. Guidelines in structural design for such conditions are obviously lacking along with knowledge of typical consequences. The EU-sponsored project VULCAN addresses blast and fire behaviour of civil fuselage structures (cabin) {{with the aim of}} achieving significant improvements. This paper deals with blast only. Characterisation and vulnerability of existing monolithic aluminium structures as well as modern laminated materials (Glare, CFRP). is undertaken in this four year program. It aims at understanding typical catastrophic failure behaviour on a dynamic materials and mechanical level and improving this through well-balanced design guidelines. A twofold approach is used, firmly building on a dedicated experimental program and validating and applying numerical simulation tools from there as well. A building block approach was conceived. First level dynamic behaviour is studied at simplified structural and materials level, addressing crack initiation and propagation. A second level introduces increasing complexities due to curvature, stringers frame (castellations) and joints. First test results from the first level are presented, concentrating on dynamic Glare prestressed panel behaviour under a special explosively generated instantaneous large crack.

5|$|When <b>pressurised,</b> a <b>cylinder</b> {{carries an}} {{equivalent}} volume of free gas greater than its water capacity, because the gas is compressed {{up to several}} hundred times atmospheric pressure. The selection of an appropriate set of diving cylinders for a diving operation {{is based on the}} amount of gas required to safely complete the dive. Diving cylinders are most commonly filled with air, but because the main components of air can cause problems when breathed underwater at higher ambient pressure, divers may choose to breathe from cylinders filled with mixtures of gases other than air. Many jurisdictions have regulations that govern the filling, recording of contents, and labelling for diving cylinders.

40|$|A {{study of}} <b>pressurised</b> <b>cylinders</b> having {{attached}} pads was made. The {{possibility of a}} fatigue crack developing along {{one side of the}} pad was noted. For both defect-free components and components having axial crack-like defects, finite element and limited experimental studies of the local and global deformations were made and results were found to be in close agreement. Both welded and integrally machined pads were studied. It was observed that for defect-free components, the method of pad attachment has little effect on the burst pressure. The presence of a pad was found to increase the burst pressure of cracked components by a small but significant margin. A finite element-based parametric study of pipes with part-penetrating defects and a range of pad geometries has demonstrated that pad size has little influence on the limit load for any of the cracked cases considered. However, pipes with penetrating defects were strengthened by the presence of pads, particularly for thin-walled sections...|$|R

Investigation is performed for a thin-wall vessel containing two external volumetric flaws with flaw depths ranging from 25 to 75 percent of the wall thickness under a range of internal pressures. Assessment based on the plastic initiation moments shows that the adjacent flaws are conservatively assessed as single flaws using the above codes' rules when flaw depths of both flaws do not exceed 60 percent of the wall thickness.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{experimental}} results are given for unreinforced circular; elliptical and square cut-outs with rounded corners, under {{a variety of}} loading conditions. These results are then compared with the infinite flat plate solution, using the complex stress function and the method of conformal transformation. It is generally considered sufficiently accurate for a plane stress solution to be applied to problems of cut-outs in cylindrical shells, provided that the cut-out dimensions are small compared with the radius of curvature of the shell. In order to investigate this effect of shell curvature, a number of experiments were carried out on cutouts in two <b>pressurised</b> <b>cylinders,</b> and to obtain a wider range of loading conditions, a further series of experiments was conducted using a plane loading frame. Two aluminium alloy cylinders, of 44 in. and 60 in. diameter, were pressurised using air, and the stress conditions around the cutouts examined using electrical resistance strain gauge techniques. The plane loading frame enabled any combination of bi-axial tension and shear to be applied to a plane sheet containing the cut-out under examination. In this way the effects of body forces, which might arise in such applications as aircraft and nuclear reactors, could be simulated. The experimental results which are given generally show a close agreement with the theoretical plane stress solution...|$|R

40|$|The {{derivation}} of {{the classical}} equation for flow through an orifice assumes a fixed orifice area. However, pipe materials exhibit expansion behaviour with increasing pressure, which alters the size of orifices and results in greater leakage rates. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to study the behaviour of round holes and cracks in pipes through theoretical and experimental work. The results of the study include equations derived for increased flow through round holes in pressurized cylindrical shells and pipes. The theoretical models explain the increased flow experienced due to the leak area increasing. The models incorporate material properties, shell geometry and fluid properties for both uni-axially and bi-axially stressed pipe sections. Analytical results are compared with previous finite element investigations. In addition, an experimental study into the effects of pressure on a round hole in a class 6 uPVC pipe was conducted. Conclusions are made relating to the influence of material expansion to increased flow rate through openings in <b>pressurised</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The results compared positively with those of the theoretical equations. Conclusions are made relating to the influence of round hole or crack expansion to an increased flow rate through openings in pressurised pipes. Results include the effects of geometrical and material variables on the expansion of round holes. Better explanation of the increased flow through orifices, documented by practical observations, is presented. Results indicate that round hole area is linearly related to pressure. However, testing on longitudinal cracks resulted in a non-linear relationship between crack area and internal pipe pressure. Results indicate the expansion of round hole area is minimal. Leakage however is greatly affected over extended time periods by even the smallest increase in defect area. Critical pressures before brittle fracture obtained from testing on longitudinal cracks were compared to theoretical formulation. Results show a close relationship between current theory and experimentation. Prof. K. van Zy...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of 18 European institutions involved in long-term non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) measurements in ambient air {{within the framework}} of the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) and the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) was assessed with respect to data quality objectives (DQOs) of ACTRIS (Aerosols, Clouds, and Trace gases Research InfraStructure Network) and GAW. Compared to previous intercomparison studies the DQOs define a novel approach to assess and ensure a high quality of the measurements. Having already been adopted by GAW, the ACTRIS DQOs are demanding with deviations to a reference value of less than 5 % and a repeatability of better than 2 % for NMHC mole fractions above 0. 1 nmol mol − 1. The participants of the intercomparison analysed two dry gas mixtures in <b>pressurised</b> <b>cylinders,</b> a 30 -component NMHC mixture in nitrogen (NMHC_N 2) at approximately 1 nmol mol − 1 and a whole air sample (NMHC_air), following a standardised operation procedure including zero- and calibration gas measurements. Furthermore, participants had to report details on their instruments and assess their measurement uncertainties. The NMHCs were analysed either by gas chromatography–flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) or by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For the NMHC_N 2 measurements, 62 % of the reported values were within the 5 % deviation class corresponding to the ACTRIS DQOs. For NMHC_air, generally more frequent and larger deviations to the assigned values were observed, with 50 % of the reported values within the 5 % deviation class. Important contributors to the poorer performance in NMHC_air compared to NMHC_N 2 were a more complex matrix and a larger span of NMHC mole fractions (0. 03 – 2. 5 nmol mol − 1).

The six leading coaches were immovable. The engine crews and the express train's guards, the sleeping car attendants, some platelayers from a hut a short distance up the line and a shepherd whose home was nearby tried desperately to rescue the trapped passengers but were eventually driven back by thick smoke.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 173 - 187. Analytical and {{computational}} {{aspects of}} solution paths for nonlinear equations are examined, {{with emphasis on}} problems {{in which there are}} many parameters. The solution to problems of this type is described by an equilibrium hypersurface and methods are presented which allow for the determination of the various features of this surface. These include methods for following numerically any curve on the primary surface, and for determining on such a curve all the singular points (both limit and bifurcation points). Further methods are then presented which allow branching onto secondary paths (subsets of secondary surfaces) from bifurcation points in order to trace out these paths and so determine the bifurcation behaviour of the problem considered. To complete the analysis of the equilibrium surface methods are developed to trace the loci of singular points. The locus of a bifurcation point determines the intersection of the primary and secondary equilibrium surfaces while the loci of limit points allow for the determination of regions of stable and unstable behaviour on the equilibrium surface. These methods are applicable to any system of nonlinear equations but the particular application here is to systems of equations obtained from the finite element approximation of boundary-value problems in elasticity. Attention is restricted to plane boundary-value problems involving incompressible hyperelastic materials. The strain-energy function used to characterise these materials is based on a symmetric function of the principal stretches. All of the above ideas are investigated numerically for the problem of a <b>pressurised</b> rubber <b>cylinder</b> subjected to axial extension.

40|$|The {{research}} {{concerns the}} influence of piles, installed beneath deep excavations, {{as a means of}} reducing movements in the surrounding ground. The work focussed on the use of piles installed as a part of top down basement construction, a technique used in conjunction with deep excavations in urban areas. The investigations sought to explore the effectiveness of bored piles as a means of enhancing the stiffness of the soil beneath the excavation and so reducing the spread of movements to the surrounding ground. Experimental data were obtained from a series of 19 centrifuge model tests undertaken at 100 g. The plane strain models consisted of a pre-formed excavation temporarily supported by fluid pressures acting at formation level and against the retaining wall. The fluid support was removed as the test proceeded and successive levels of props were advanced against the retaining wall using <b>pressurised</b> hydraulic <b>cylinders</b> as jacks. Ground movements were measured using a combination of transducers and analysis of digital images from a camera viewing the front of the model seen through the Perspex side of the model container. These systems gave ground surface, formation level and wall displacement profiles as well as overall patterns of movement. The general model behaviour was characterised in a series of datum tests. These established the magnitude of displacements generated with ground support provided by the retaining wall alone in key positions throughout the model. Following this the overall stiffness of the soil below excavation formation level was enhanced by the introduction of either one or two rows of cast in situ piles installed at distances of 3 and 6 pile diameters from the retaining wall during model making. Direct comparison was then made between the various test results. These procedures were repeated in a small number of additional tests in which the retaining wall embedment depth was reduced. The use of piles was found to reduce both horizontal movements and settlement behind the retaining wall. Maximum reductions in settlement behind the retaining wall were found to be about 55...|$|R

An indirect method of adsorption-desorption tests was conducted on cylindrical coal samples to simulate coal seam gas migration.

5000|$|In a {{hydropneumatic}} suspension system, each wheel is connected, {{not to a}} spring, but to a hydraulic suspension unit consisting of a hydraulic accumulator sphere of about 12 cm in diameter containing <b>pressurised</b> nitrogen, a <b>cylinder</b> containing hydraulic fluid screwed to the suspension sphere, a piston inside the cylinder connected by levers to the suspension itself, and a damper valve between the piston and the sphere. A membrane in the sphere prevented the nitrogen from escaping. The motion of the wheels translated to a motion of the piston, which acted on the oil in the nitrogen cushion and provided the spring effect. The damper valve took place of the shock absorber in conventional suspensions. The hydraulic cylinder was fed with hydraulic fluid from the main pressure reservoir via a height corrector, a valve controlled by the mid-position of the anti-roll bar connected to the axle. If the suspension was too low, the height corrector introduced high-pressure fluid; if it was too high, it released fluid back to the fluid reservoir. In this manner, a constant ride height was maintained. A control in the cabin allowed the driver to select one of five heights: normal riding height, two slightly higher riding heights for poor terrain, and two extreme positions for changing wheels.

40|$|In {{this work}} multi-scale CT {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to characterise the material structure of PMCs, from the whole engineering structure geometry down to individual fibre level. The techniques have first been applied to a 'model' aerospace grade carbon/epoxy notched laminate loaded in-situ in tension to failure. The material structure and damage mechanisms of internally <b>pressurised</b> experimental <b>cylinders</b> have then been investigated and compared to the notched laminate. It was found the damage accumulation of both samples to be comparable, where fibre breaks were the dominant strength controlling mechanism. The data provides, to the authors knowledge, the first direct internal 3 D measurement of the accumulation of fibre damage for commercial CFRP materials under structurally relevant load conditions. A high level of confidence is placed in the measurements, as the failure processes are viewed internally at the relevant micromechanical length-scales, as opposed to previous indirect and/or surface-based methods. Whilst fibre breaks are the dominant composite damage mechanism considered in the work, matrix damage was also seen to occur in advance of extensive fibre breaks. The formation of clusters of broken fibres were observed at high loads in both sample types. The largest clusters were observed in the notched laminate sample, consisting of a group of eleven breaks and a group of fourteen breaks. In comparison, clusters of only four neighbouring breaks were observed in the pressure vessel samples. A correlation between fibre volume fraction and fibre breaks was found, in which higher fibre volume fractions result in higher fibre break densities. No strong correlation was found between the location of matrix damage and fibre breaks in both sample types. Initial analysis showed some correlation between fibre breaks and voids, however further work has been recommended to confirm this. A simple 3 D Finite Element Analysis was carried out for the pressure vessel to give an understanding of the stress partitioning through the composite layers and confirm the damage found experimentally. The data sets of the accumulation of fibre breaks with load provide evidence to validate or inform existing micromechanical models, for two different carbon fibre systems, where previous experimental findings are limited.

5000|$|The South African {{chemical}} weapons program investigated all the standard CW agents such as irritant riot control agents, lethal nerve agents and anticholinergic deliriants, {{which have been}} researched by virtually all countries that have carried out CW research. The South African program differed in its aims from the CBW programmes of many countries in that {{a major focus of}} the program was to develop non-lethal agents to help suppress internal dissent. This led to the investigation of unusual non-lethal agents, including illicit recreational drugs such as phencyclidine, MDMA, methaqualone and cocaine, as well as medicinal drugs such as diazepam, ketamine, suxamethonium and tubocurarine, as potential incapacitating agents. According to the testimony given by Wouter Basson to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, analogues of these compounds were prepared and studied, and both methaqualone and MDMA (along with the deliriant BZ) were manufactured in large quantities and successfully weaponised into a fine dust or aerosol form that could be released over a crowd as a potential riot control agent. Basson was later found to have also been selling large quantities of MDMA and methaqualone as tablets on the black market, but the amount manufactured was far larger than what was sold and the court accepted that at least some genuine weaponisation and testing of these agents had been done.
