5|$|Proteasomes are protein {{complexes}} which degrade unneeded {{or damaged}} proteins by <b>proteolysis,</b> a chemical reaction that breaks peptide bonds. Enzymes that help such reactions are called proteases.|$|E
5|$|The {{proteasome}} is {{also involved}} in Intracellular antibody-mediated <b>proteolysis</b> of antibody-bound virions. In this neutralisation pathway, TRIM21 (a protein of the tripartite motif family) binds with immunoglobulin G to direct the virion to the proteasome where it is degraded.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>proteolysis</b> by the β subunits of the 20S core particle {{is through a}} threonine-dependent nucleophilic attack. This mechanism may depend on an associated water molecule for deprotonation of the reactive threonine hydroxyl. Degradation occurs within the central chamber formed by the association of the two β rings and normally does not release partially degraded products, instead reducing the substrate to short polypeptides typically 7–9 residues long, though they can range from 4 to 25 residues, depending on the organism and substrate. The biochemical mechanism that determines product length is not fully characterized. Although the three catalytic β subunits have a common mechanism, they have slightly different substrate specificities, which are considered chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing (PHGH)-like. These variations in specificity {{are the result of}} interatomic contacts with local residues near the active sites of each subunit. Each catalytic β subunit also possesses a conserved lysine residue required for <b>proteolysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The same triad {{geometries}} been converged upon by serine proteases {{such as the}} chymotrypsin and subtilisin superfamilies. Similar convergent {{evolution has}} occurred with cysteine proteases such as viral C3 protease and papain superfamilies. These triads have converged to almost the same arrangement due to the mechanistic similarities in cysteine and serine <b>proteolysis</b> mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{mechanisms}} {{exist to}} promote the degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins via the proteasome system. In particular, proteasomes localized to the nucleus are regulated by PARP and actively degrade inappropriately oxidized histones. Oxidized proteins, which often form large amorphous aggregates in the cell, can be degraded directly by the 20S core particle without the 19S regulatory cap and do not require ATP hydrolysis or tagging with ubiquitin. However, high levels of oxidative damage increases the degree of cross-linking between protein fragments, rendering the aggregates resistant to <b>proteolysis.</b> Larger numbers and sizes of such highly oxidized aggregates are associated with aging.|$|E
5|$|A B cell {{identifies}} pathogens when antibodies on {{its surface}} bind to a specific foreign antigen. This antigen/antibody complex is {{taken up by the}} B cell and processed by <b>proteolysis</b> into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides {{on its surface}} MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.|$|E
5|$|Although most proteasomal {{substrates}} must be ubiquitinated {{before being}} degraded, {{there are some}} exceptions to this general rule, especially when the proteasome plays a normal role in the post-translational processing of the protein. The proteasomal activation of NF-κB by processing p105 into p50 via internal <b>proteolysis</b> is one major example. Some proteins that are hypothesized to be unstable due to intrinsically unstructured regions, are degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner. The most well-known example of a ubiquitin-independent proteasome substrate is the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. Ubiquitin-independent mechanisms targeting key cell cycle regulators such as p53 have also been reported, although p53 is also subject to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Finally, structurally abnormal, misfolded, or highly oxidized proteins are also subject to ubiquitin-independent and 19S-independent degradation under conditions of cellular stress.|$|E
5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS <b>proteolysis</b> {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the degradation of tumor suppressor gene products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through <b>proteolysis</b> of cyclines and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|E
5|$|The 19S {{particle}} in eukaryotes {{consists of}} 19 individual proteins and is divisible into two subassemblies, a 9-subunit base that binds {{directly to the}} α ring of the 20S core particle, and a 10-subunit lid. Six of the nine base proteins are ATPase subunits from the AAA Family, and an evolutionary homolog of these ATPases exists in archaea, called PAN (Proteasome-Activating Nucleotidase). The association of the 19S and 20S particles requires the binding of ATP to the 19S ATPase subunits, and ATP hydrolysis {{is required for the}} assembled complex to degrade folded and ubiquitinated proteins. Note that only the step of substrate unfolding requires energy from ATP hydrolysis, while ATP-binding alone can support all the other steps required for protein degradation (e.g., complex assembly, gate opening, translocation, and <b>proteolysis).</b> In fact, ATP binding to the ATPases by itself supports the rapid degradation of unfolded proteins. However, while ATP hydrolysis is required for unfolding only, it is not yet clear whether this energy may be used in the coupling of some of these steps.|$|E
5|$|After {{a protein}} has been ubiquitinated, it is {{recognized}} by the 19S regulatory particle in an ATP-dependent binding step. The substrate protein must then enter {{the interior of the}} 20S particle to come in contact with the proteolytic active sites. Because the 20S particle's central channel is narrow and gated by the N-terminal tails of the α ring subunits, the substrates must be at least partially unfolded before they enter the core. The passage of the unfolded substrate into the core is called translocation and necessarily occurs after deubiquitination. However, the order in which substrates are deubiquitinated and unfolded is not yet clear. Which of these processes is the rate-limiting step in the overall <b>proteolysis</b> reaction depends on the specific substrate; for some proteins, the unfolding process is rate-limiting, while deubiquitination is the slowest step for other proteins. The extent to which substrates must be unfolded before translocation is not known, but substantial tertiary structure, and in particular nonlocal interactions such as disulfide bonds, are sufficient to inhibit degradation. The presence of intrinsically disordered protein segments of sufficient size, either at the protein terminus or internally, has also been proposed to facilitate efficient initiation of degradation.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the ubiquitin proteasome system, protein degradation in cells was thought to rely mainly on lysosomes, membrane-bound organelles with acidic and protease-filled interiors that can degrade and then recycle exogenous proteins and aged or damaged organelles. However, work by Alfred Goldberg in 1977 on ATP-dependent protein degradation in reticulocytes, which lack lysosomes, suggested the presence of a second intracellular degradation mechanism. This was shown in 1978 to be composed of several distinct protein chains, a novelty among proteases at the time. Later work on modification of histones led to the identification of an unexpected covalent modification of the histone protein by a bond between a lysine side chain of the histone and the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin, a protein that had no known function. It was then discovered that a previously identified protein associated with proteolytic degradation, known as ATP-dependent <b>proteolysis</b> factor 1 (APF-1), was the same protein as ubiquitin. The proteolytic activities of this system was isolated as a multi-protein complex originally called the multi-catalytic proteinase complex by Sherwin Wilk and Marion Orlowski. Later, the ATP-dependent proteolytic complex that was responsible for ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation was discovered and was called the 26S proteasome.|$|E
5|$|The {{number and}} {{diversity}} of subunits contained in the 20S core particle depends on the organism; the number of distinct and specialized subunits is larger in multicellular than unicellular organisms and larger in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes. All 20S particles consist of four stacked heptameric ring structures that are themselves composed of {{two different types of}} subunits; α subunits are structural in nature, whereas β subunits are predominantly catalytic. The outer two rings in the stack consist of seven α subunits each, which serve as docking domains for the regulatory particles and the alpha subunits N-termini form a gate that blocks unregulated access of substrates to the interior cavity. The inner two rings each consist of seven β subunits and contain the protease active sites that perform the <b>proteolysis</b> reactions. Three distinct catalytic activities were identified in the purified complex: chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing. The size of the proteasome is relatively conserved and is about 150 angstroms (Å) by 115Å. The interior chamber is at most 53Å wide, though the entrance can be as narrow as 13Å, suggesting that substrate proteins must be at least partially unfolded to enter.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{more than}} 50 clans are known, each {{indicating}} an independent evolutionary origin of <b>proteolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|At the {{molecular}} level, hyperactive apoptosis {{can be caused}} by defects in signaling pathways that regulate the Bcl-2 family proteins. Increased expression of apoptotic proteins such as BIM, or their decreased <b>proteolysis,</b> leads to cell death, and can cause a number of pathologies, depending on the cells where excessive activity of BIM occurs. Cancer cells can escape apoptosis through mechanisms that suppress BIM expression or by increased <b>proteolysis</b> of BIM.|$|E
25|$|PA clan - Members share a chymotrypsin-like double β-barrel fold {{and similar}} <b>proteolysis</b> {{mechanisms}} but sequence identity of <10%. The clan contains both cysteine and serine proteases (different nucleophiles).|$|E
25|$|As {{a student}} under Nasmyth, Amon {{demonstrated}} that CDC28 protein kinase {{is not required}} for the metaphase to anaphase transition and CLB2 <b>proteolysis</b> continues until reactivation of CDC28 {{toward the end of}} G1.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, the analyte itself must be {{adjusted}} so that analysis is possible, {{such as in}} protein mass spectrometry, where usually the protein of interest is cleaved into peptides before analysis, either by in-gel digestion or by <b>proteolysis</b> in solution.|$|E
25|$|The {{proteins}} in the gamma secretase complex are heavily modified by <b>proteolysis</b> during assembly and maturation of the complex; a required activation step {{is in the}} autocatalytic cleavage of presenilin to N- and C-terminal fragments. Nicastrin's primary role is in maintaining {{the stability of the}} assembled complex and regulating intracellular protein trafficking. PEN-2 associates with the complex via binding of a transmembrane domain of presenilin and, among other possible roles, helps to stabilize the complex after presenilin <b>proteolysis</b> has generated the activated N-terminal and C-terminal fragments. APH-1, which is required for proteolytic activity, binds to the complex via a conserved alpha helix interaction motif and aids in initiating assembly of premature components.|$|E
25|$|General {{secondary}} structure composition {{can be determined}} via circular dichroism. Vibrational spectroscopy {{can also be used}} to characterize the conformation of peptides, polypeptides, and proteins. Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy has become a valuable method to investigate the structures of flexible peptides and proteins that cannot be studied with other methods. A more qualitative picture of protein structure is often obtained by <b>proteolysis,</b> which is also useful to screen for more crystallizable protein samples. Novel implementations of this approach, including fast parallel <b>proteolysis</b> (FASTpp), can probe the structured fraction and its stability without the need for purification. Once a protein's structure has been experimentally determined, further detailed studies can be done computationally, using molecular dynamic simulations of that structure.|$|E
25|$|Elevated {{levels of}} {{cortisol}}, if prolonged, {{can lead to}} <b>proteolysis</b> (breakdown of proteins) and muscle wasting. Several {{studies have shown that}} cortisol can have a lipolytic effect (promote the breakdown of fat). Under some conditions, however, cortisol may somewhat suppress lipolysis.|$|E
25|$|The cIII protein acts {{to protect}} the cII protein from <b>proteolysis</b> by FtsH (a membrane-bound {{essential}} E. coli protease) by acting as a competitive inhibitor. This inhibition can induce a bacteriostatic state, which favours lysogeny. cIII also directly stabilises the cII protein.|$|E
25|$|DCC has {{extracellular}} binding {{sites for}} both netrin-1 and heparin. Heparin sulphate {{is believed to}} also be present during neural growth {{as a type of}} co-factor for axon guidance. Intracellularly, DCC has been shown to have a caspase-3 <b>proteolysis</b> site at Asp 1290.|$|E
25|$|The linker domain is {{the site}} of most post-translational modification, which include glycosylation, phosphorylation, and limited <b>proteolysis.</b> By electrophoretic {{analysis}} IGFBP-3 appears as a doublet, owing to the occupancy of either two or three of its N-glycosylation sites by carbohydrate. Hypoglycosylated IGFBP-3 may be seen after extended glucose starvation.|$|E
25|$|Lumenal {{proteins}} can {{be predicted}} computationally {{based on their}} targeting signals. In Arabidopsis, out of the predicted lumenal proteins possessing the Tat signal, the largest groups with known functions are 19% involved in protein processing (<b>proteolysis</b> and folding), 18% in photosynthesis, 11% in metabolism, and 7% redox carriers and defense.|$|E
25|$|The gamma secretase {{complex is}} thought to {{assemble}} and mature via <b>proteolysis</b> in the early endoplasmic reticulum. The complexes are then transported to the late ER where they interact with and cleave their substrate proteins. Gamma secretase complexes have also been observed localized to the mitochondria, where they {{may play a role}} in promoting apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Many proteases {{are known}} to cleave IGFBP-3 at single linker-domain sites, and in the {{circulation}} of pregnant women, IGFBP-3 is entirely proteolyzed, yet still capable of carrying normal amounts of IGF-1 and IGF-2. Binding capacity appears to be retained after <b>proteolysis</b> because of a cooperative interaction between the two proteolyzed fragments, that together maintain an active IGF-binding site.|$|E
25|$|The PA clan (Proteases {{of mixed}} nucleophile, {{superfamily}} A) {{is the largest}} group of proteases with common ancestry as identified by structural homology. Members have a chymotrypsin-like fold and similar <b>proteolysis</b> mechanisms but sequence identity of <10%. The clan contains both cysteine and serine proteases (different nucleophiles). PA clan proteases can be found in plants, animals, fungi, eubacteria, archaea and viruses.|$|E
25|$|Rising {{levels of}} sterols {{increase}} the susceptibility of the reductase enzyme to ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and <b>proteolysis.</b> Helices 2-6 (total of 8) of the HMG-CoA reductase transmembrane domain sense {{the higher levels}} of cholesterol, {{which leads to the}} exposure of Lysine 248. This lysine residue can become ubiquinated by the E3 ligase AMFR, serving as a signal for proteolytic degradation.|$|E
25|$|In vertebrates, {{melatonin}} secretion {{is regulated}} by norepinephrine. Norepinephrine elevates the intracellular cAMP concentration via beta-adrenergic receptors and activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates the penultimate enzyme, the arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT). On exposure to (day)light, noradrenergic stimulation stops and the protein is immediately destroyed by proteasomal <b>proteolysis.</b> Production of melatonin is again {{started in the}} evening at the point called the dim-light melatonin onset.|$|E
25|$|<b>Proteolysis</b> {{does not}} always yield a set of readily analyzable {{peptides}} covering the entire sequence of the POI. The fragmentation of peptides in the mass spectrometer often does not yield ions corresponding to cleavage at each peptide bond. Thus, the deduced sequence for each peptide is not necessarily complete. The standard methods of fragmentation do not distinguish between leucine and isoleucine residues since they are isomeric.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{contributor}} to angiogenesis is matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). MMPs help degrade the proteins that keep the vessel walls solid. This <b>proteolysis</b> allows the endothelial cells to escape into the interstitial matrix as seen in sprouting angiogenesis. Inhibition of MMPs prevents the formation of new capillaries. These enzymes are highly regulated during the vessel formation process because destruction of the extracellular matrix would decrease {{the integrity of the}} microvasculature.|$|E
25|$|Maturation of {{the notch}} {{receptor}} involves cleavage at the prospective extracellular side during intracellular trafficking in the Golgi complex. This {{results in a}} bipartite protein, composed of a large extracellular domain linked to the smaller transmembrane and intracellular domain. Binding of ligand promotes two proteolytic processing events; {{as a result of}} <b>proteolysis,</b> the intracellular domain is liberated and can enter the nucleus to engage other DNA-binding proteins and regulate gene expression.|$|E
25|$|Also proteases are {{released}} during cell lysis, which will start digesting the proteins in the solution. If the protein {{of interest is}} sensitive to <b>proteolysis,</b> it is recommended to proceed quickly, {{and to keep the}} extract cooled, to slow down the digestion. Alternatively, one or more protease inhibitors can be added to the lysis buffer immediately before cell disruption. Sometimes it is also necessary to add DNAse {{in order to reduce the}} viscosity of the cell lysate caused by a high DNA content.|$|E
25|$|For IGFs {{to reach}} the tissues from the bloodstream, the {{circulating}} complexes are believed to partly dissociate, possibly enhanced by limited <b>proteolysis</b> of IGFBP-3. The IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio has sometimes been used as an index of IGF bioavailability in the human circulation, but this ignores IGF-1 binding to other IGFBPs (so the ratio {{is affected by the}} concentrations of all six IGFBPs), and the fact that IGF-2, which is three times more abundant than IGF-1 in the bloodstream of adults, occupies the majority of binding sites on circulating IGFBP-3.|$|E
25|$|Transcription of the reductase gene is {{enhanced}} by the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP). This protein binds to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), located on the 5' end of the reductase gene. When SREBP is inactive, it is bound to the ER or nuclear membrane with another protein called SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). When cholesterol levels fall, SREBP is released from the membrane by <b>proteolysis</b> and migrates to the nucleus, where it binds to the SRE and transcription {{is enhanced}}. If cholesterol levels rise, proteolytic cleavage of SREBP from the membrane ceases and any proteins in the nucleus are quickly degraded.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{the muscle}} {{proteins}} denature in varying degree, {{with the exception}} of the collagen and elastin of connective tissue, and rigor mortis resolves. Because of these changes, the meat is tender and pliable when cooked just after death or after the resolution of rigor, but tough when cooked during rigor. As the muscle pigment myoglobin denatures, its iron oxidates, which may cause a brown discoloration near the surface of the meat. Ongoing <b>proteolysis</b> also contributes to conditioning. Hypoxanthine, a breakdown product of ATP, contributes to the meat's flavor and odor, as do other products of the decomposition of muscle fat and protein.|$|E
