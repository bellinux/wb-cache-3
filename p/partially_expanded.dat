2500|$|In 1803, Charlotte Dundas {{showed the}} {{practicality}} of steam power for marine use, and in 1812 Henry Bell's PS Comet began the first commercially successful steamboat service in Europe, sailing on the River Clyde between Glasgow and Helensburgh. Others soon followed, and by mid century a large fleet of Clyde steamers competed for holiday and excursion traffic down the River and Firth of Clyde. By {{the end of}} the century paddle steamers had reached a peak of design, with a maximum economic operating speed of around 19 knots (35km/h), but speed was at a premium, particularly on the longer routes such as sailings from Glasgow to Inveraray and Campbeltown. Up to this time, vessels had been powered by reciprocating steam engines. [...] Steam was generated by boilers, and piped to cylinders wherein it drove pistons, the back-and-forth motion of which was converted to rotary motion by connecting rods. [...] Early vessels were driven by paddle wheels, but at mid-century screws became more prevalent. Although increased boiler pressures and the reuse of <b>partially</b> <b>expanded</b> steam in compound engines greatly increased efficiency, the continual creation and destruction of momentum of their heavy reciprocating parts each turn of the crankshaft put great strain on the engines, which required constant maintenance.|$|E
60|$|This common {{species is}} more {{frequently}} met with than many others, because it prefers shallow water, and often lives high up among rocks which are only {{covered by the}} sea at very high tide; so that the creature can, if it will, spend but a short portion of its time immersed. When uncovered by the tide, it gathers up its leathery tunic, and presents the appearance of fig. 1 A. When under water it may often be seen expanding its flower-like disk and moving its feelers in search of food. These feelers have a certain power of adhesion, and any not too vigorous animals which they touch are easily drawn towards the centre and swallowed. Around {{the margin of the}} tunic are seen peeping out between the tentacles certain bright blue globules looking very like eyes, but whose purpose is not exactly ascertained. Fig. 1 represents the disk only <b>partially</b> <b>expanded.</b>|$|E
60|$|Dutrochet made no {{observations}} on the sensitiveness of the tendrils. These, whilst young and about an inch in length with the leaflets on the petiole only <b>partially</b> <b>expanded,</b> are highly sensitive; a single light touch with a twig on the inferior or concave surface near the tip caused them to bend quickly, as did occasionally a loop of thread weighing one-seventh of a grain (9.25 mg.). The upper or convex surface is barely {{or not at all}} sensitive. Tendrils, after bending from a touch, straighten themselves in about two hours, and are then ready to act again. As soon as they begin to grow old, the extremities of their two or three pairs of branches become hooked, and they then appear to form an excellent grappling instrument; {{but this is not the}} case. For at this period they have generally quite lost their sensitiveness; and when hooked on to twigs, some were not at all affected, and others required from 18 hrs. to 24 hrs. before clasping such twigs; nevertheless, they were able to utilise the last vestige of irritability owing to their extremities being hooked. Ultimately the lateral branches contract spirally, but not the middle or main stem.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Measurements of the {{differential}} heats of K-Ca exchange {{are used to}} show that 6 groups of sites (ranging from- 13. 8 to- 5. 1 kJ/eq and {{with as many as}} 4 in any one sample) exist in kaolins that range from 0 to 15 % in their 2 : 1 phyllosillicate content. These heat values, coupled with entropies of exchange, suggest that 0. 1 - 10 % vermiculitic, micaceous, and smectitic layers are present, presumably interstratified with kaolinitic layers which are assumed to have no permanent charge. Changes in the activity coefficients of adsorbed K with K saturation confirm these conclusions qualitatively. Thus, fK values at x ~ 0 correlate inversely (r 2 = 0. 655) with the content of vermiculite + <b>partially</b> <b>expanding</b> micas, and x values at maxi-mumfKindicatethecontentofvermiculite + nonexpandingmica + <b>partially</b> <b>expanding</b> micas (r 2 = 0. 732).

6000|$|THE {{connection}} between Brainstones, Mushroom Corals, and other Madrepores abounding on Polynesian reefs, and the [...] "Sea Anemones," [...] which have lately become so {{familiar to us}} all, {{can be seen by}} comparing our comparatively insignificant C. Smithii with our commonest species of Actinia and Sagartia. The former is a beautiful object when the fleshy part and tentacles are wholly or <b>partially</b> <b>expanded.</b> Like Actinia, it has a membranous covering, a simple sac-like stomach, a central mouth, a disk surrounded by contractile and adhesive tentacles. Unlike Actinia, it is fixed to submarine bodies, to which it is glued in very early life, and cannot change its place. Unlike Actinia, its body is supported by a stony skeleton of calcareous plates arranged edgewise so as to radiate from the centre. But as we find some Molluscs furnished with a shell, and others even of the same character and habits without one, so we find that in spite of this seemingly important difference, the animals are very similar in their nature. Since the introduction of glass tanks we have opportunities of seeing anemones crawling up the sides, so as to exhibit their entire basal disk, and then we may observe lightly coloured lines of a less transparent substance than the interstices, radiating from the margin to the centre, some short, others reaching the entire distance, and arranged in exactly the same manner as the plates of Caryophyllaea. These are doubtless flexible walls of compartments dividing the fleshy parts of the softer animals, and corresponding with the septa of the coral. Fig. 2 A represents a section of the latter, to be compared with the basal disk of Sagartia.|$|E

50|$|Sea anemones of {{this species}} have a {{symbiotic}} relationship with zooxanthellae, photosynthetic single-celled algae residing within the tissues of the host. There are between twenty and thirty times more algal cells in the pseudotentacles than {{there are in the}} true tentacles. There is a daily rhythm by which the pseudotentacles spread out to expose themselves to light by day and close up at night, at which time the feeding tentacles expand. When the anemone is in a low nutritional state, the pseudotentacles expand fully during the day, but a well-fed anemone only <b>partially</b> <b>expands</b> them. The expansion of the true tentacles is a feeding response and is increased when the animal is in a high nutritional state.|$|R

50|$|The fixed blades act as nozzles.

40|$|We {{consider}} a simple model of <b>partially</b> <b>expanding</b> map on the torus. We study {{the spectrum of}} the Ruelle transfer operator and show that {{in the limit of}} high frequencies in the neutral direction (this is a semiclassical limit), the spectrum develops a spectral gap, for a generic map. This result has already been obtained by M. Tsujii (05). The novelty here is that we use semiclassical analysis which provides a different and quite natural description. We show that the transfer operator is a semiclassical operator with a well defined "classical dynamics" on the cotangent space. This classical dynamics has a "trapped set" which is responsible for the Ruelle resonances spectrum. In particular we show that the spectral gap is closely related to a specific dynamical property of this trapped set. Comment: 24 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a simple model {{of an open}} <b>partially</b> <b>expanding</b> map. Its trapped set K in phase space is a fractal set. We first {{show that there is}} a well defined discrete spectrum of Ruelle resonances which describes the asymptotics of correlation functions for large time and which is parametrized by the Fourier component ν on the neutral direction of the dynamics. We introduce a specific hypothesis on the dynamics that we call "minimal captivity". This hypothesis is stable under perturbations and means that the dynamics is univalued on a neighborhood of K. Under this hypothesis we show the existence of an asymptotic spectral gap and a Fractal Weyl law for the upper bound of density of Ruelle resonances in the semiclassical limit ν -> infinity. Some numerical computations with the truncated Gauss map illustrate these results. Comment: 65 page...|$|R

5000|$|The test is not infallible {{and many}} factors {{can cause the}} test to give false {{positive}} or negative results.

50|$|In {{this type}} of {{compounding}} the steam is expanded {{in a number of}} stages, instead of just one (nozzle) in the velocity compounding. It is done by the fixed blades which act as nozzles. The steam expands equally in all rows of fixed blade. The steam coming from the boiler is fed to the first set of fixed blades i.e. the nozzle ring. The steam is <b>partially</b> <b>expanded</b> in the nozzle ring. Hence, there is a partial decrease in pressure of the incoming steam. This leads to an increase in the velocity of the steam. Therefore the pressure decreases and velocity increases partially in the nozzle.|$|E

The basal diffraction peaks of <b>expanding</b> and <b>partially</b> <b>expanding</b> clay minerals vary considerably in spacing and intensity with normal variations of relative humidity. These variations may be eliminated by the application of a simple modification to standard x-ray equipment. This modification is useful in maintaining a constant relative humidity at values between < 1 and 100 percent. Dry air is used to main-tain the effects of dehydration by heat and, in many cases, may be used as a substitute for heat treatment. This is especially true for mixed-layer minerals, which give more intense and more reproducible diffraction effects in dry air. Wet air is better, in many instances, than glycerol or ethylene glycol in resolving the basal reflections of montmorillonite and illite in mixtures. More information can be obtained from preparations of mixed-layer minerals and mixtures of clay minerals by recording the diffraction pattern at various stages of hydration...|$|R
40|$|In many {{planning}} domains, it {{is impossible}} to construct plans that are guaranteed to keep the system completely safe. A common approach is to build probabilistic plans that are guaranteed to maintain system with a sufficiently high probability. For many such domains, bounds on system safety cannot be computed analytically, but instead rely on execution sampling coupled with a plan verification techniques. While probabilistic planning with verification can work well, it is not adequate in situations in which some modes of failure are very rare, simply because too many execution traces must be sampled (e. g., 10 12) to ensure that the rare events of interest will occur even once. The P-CIRCA planner seeks to solve planning problems while probabilistically guaranteeing safety. Our domains frequently involve verifying that the probability of failure is below a low threshold (< 0. 01). Because the events we sample have such low probabilities, we use Importance sampling (IS) (Hammersley and Handscomb 1964; Clarke and Zuliani 2011) {{to reduce the number of}} samples required. However, since we deal with an abstracted model, we cannot bias all paths individually. This prevents IS from achieving a correct bias.
