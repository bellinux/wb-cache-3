25|$|In some countries, {{a popular}} form, <b>parboiled</b> <b>rice</b> (also known as {{converted}} rice) {{is subjected to}} a steaming or parboiling process while still a brown rice grain. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, {{and the color of}} the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. Milled <b>parboiled</b> <b>rice</b> is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice, because the process causes nutrients from the outer husk (especially thiamine) to move into the endosperm, so that less is subsequently lost when the husk is polished off during milling. <b>Parboiled</b> <b>rice</b> has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular white rice.

The soaking time was 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 4 h, followed by steaming at temperature of 100 oC for 10, 15 and 20 min. The samples were then shade dried at 30 ± 1 o C and 60 ± 5 %RH to a final moisture content of 13 ± 1 % (w. b.). Physicochemical properties were determined and sensory analysis was performed for selected processing conditions. Head rice yield, yellowness (b-value), whiteness, hardness, water absorption, vitamin E and vitamin B 2 were measured and {{compared with those of}} commercial parboiled paddy. Results revealed that the head rice yield, color (b-value), cooking time and hardness of <b>parboiled</b> brown <b>rice</b> were decreased whereas whiteness and water absorption were increased compared with commercial parboiled paddy.

40|$|Diabetes {{and obesity}} are chronic {{illnesses}} increasing at dramatic {{rates in the}} U. S. and around the world. Research has looked to prevent or control diabetes and obesity through functional ingredients such as healthy-dietary carbohydrates to control blood glucose levels. Starch is a principle carbohydrate, which influences blood glucose levels, and measuring starch digestibility fractions can help predict the glucose response in the body. The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the functional starch content of <b>parboiled</b> brown <b>rice</b> flour and grain sorghum flour, and measure the effects on postprandial plasma glucose and insulin levels of 14 and 10 healthy men after consuming a <b>parboiled</b> brown <b>rice</b> flour pudding and grain sorghum flour muffin, respectively. For control treatments, a standard 50 g glucose solution served as the <b>parboiled</b> brown <b>rice</b> flour pudding control, and a wheat flour muffin was compared to the grain sorghum muffin. Initial flour materials and final food products were analyzed for total starch (TS) content as well as the starch digestibility fractions: rapidly-digestible starch (RDS), slowly-digestible starch (SDS), and resistant starch (RS). Using a randomized-crossover design, male subjects consumed treatments during respective studies within a one-week washout period, and glucose and insulin levels were observed at 15 minutes before and at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 180 minutes after consumption in addition the incremental Area Under the Curve (iAUC) was calculated.

50|$|The {{starches}} in <b>parboiled</b> <b>rice</b> become gelatinized, then retrograded after cooling. Through gelatinization, amylose molecules leach {{out of the}} {{starch granule}} network and diffuse into the surrounding aqueous medium outside the granules which, when fully hydrated are at maximum viscosity. The <b>parboiled</b> <b>rice</b> kernels should be translucent when wholly gelatinized. Cooling brings retrogradation whereby amylose molecules re-associate {{with each other and}} form a tightly packed structure. This increases the formation of type 3-resistant starch which can act as a prebiotic and benefit good health in humans. However, this also makes the kernels harder and glassier. <b>Parboiled</b> <b>rice</b> takes less time to cook and is firmer and less sticky. In North America <b>parboiled</b> <b>rice</b> is either partially or fully precooked before sale. Minerals such as zinc or iron are added, increasing their potential bioavailability in the diet.|$|E

However, water-holding capacity is a time-specific measurement that is limited to the status of the substrate immediately after saturation and drainage.

A new procedure was developed that generated a single numeric value that described the wetness of a substrate and in so doing took into account the substrate’s water-holding capacity and drying rate. This value was referred to as an E-value.

40|$|Puffed cereals are {{processed}} grain formulations commonly used as ready-to-eat (RTE) breakfast foods and are appreciated mainly for their lightness and crispiness. Puffing process involves the release or {{expansion of gas}} within a product either to create an internal structure or to expand or rupture an existing structure. In this study, oven-puffing is performed using high-temperature, short-time (HTST) treatment with heated sand. Three varieties of <b>parboiled</b> milled <b>rice</b> namely Sukara, IR- 64 and Ziri, commonly used for making puffed rice, are studied and their physicochemical characteristics observed. The degree of expansion of the rice kernels {{is found to be}} affected by parameters which are connected with the compositional characteristics and processing of the grain. The optimum puffing conditions were found to be 15 s, 250 ˚C and 11 % (wet basis) for puffing time, sand temperature and final moisture content for all the three varieties respectively. Apart from physicochemical analysis, scanning electron microscopy images of transverse section of the kernels, under various conditions of puffing, are studied for their ultrastructural differences using image processing algorithms. Using these algorithms, the cellular structure of the grain is characterized to calculate the average area and the number density of pores as an indicator of the puffing quality. status: publishe...|$|R

Five cooked rice types including brown rice (BR), white <b>rice</b> (WR), <b>parboiled</b> white <b>rice</b> (PR), high amylose white rice (HR) and waxy white rice (WXR) were chewed by six subjects. The chewing behaviours were recorded and the food boluses were collected during mastication. Rice types were found to significantly influence all chewing parameters evaluated. The WXR and BR showed the most pronounced differences compared with other rice types. The initial moisture content of un-chewed WXR was lowest (43. 39 %) whereas those of other rice types were ranged from 66. 86 to 70. 33 %. The bolus obtained from chewing the WXR contained lowest moisture content (56. 43 %) whilst its solid loss (22. 03 %) was not significant {{different from those of}} all rice types.

40|$|The role of {{proteins}} in the pasting and cooking properties of non-parboiled (npb) and <b>parboiled</b> (pb) <b>rice</b> was tested {{by means of}} a reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) and a protease (trypsin). DTT increased the swelling power and carbohydrate leaching of flour from npb rice flour but decreased its amylose leaching. Although DTT slightly increased the Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA) viscosity at the initial stages of the pasting process, it decreased RVA viscosity in the further phases of the experiment. Preincubation of flour with a trypsin decreased RVA viscosity along the whole temperature profile. Addition of DTT to the cooking water decreased water absorption and rice hardness and increased leaching of solids during cooking and stickiness of the cooked npb rice. Addition of DTT to the cooking water of flour from pb rice increased swelling power, carbohydrate leaching, and amylose leaching. Addition of DTT also increased RVA viscosity. Preincubation with trypsin had a similar effect but the changes were less pronounced. Addition of DTT increased stickiness of cooked pb rice and increased water absorption and leaching of solids during cooking. Taken together, the results provide evidence for the existence of a protein barrier affecting starch swelling, rheological, and cooking properties of both npb and pb rice. status: publishe...|$|R

Placement of moisture in the paddy seed is critical while drying. Traditionally, human experts determine the temperature and duration of drying to keep the proper moisture distribution within the paddy seed.
