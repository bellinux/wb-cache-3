40|$|One of {{the tools}} for optimal crop {{production}} is regular monitoring and assessment of crops. During the growing season of fruit trees, the bloom period has increased photosynthetic rates that correlate with the fruiting process. This paper presents {{the development of an}} image processing algorithm to detect <b>peach</b> <b>blossoms</b> on trees. Aerial images of peach (Prunus persica) trees were acquired from both experimental and commercial peach orchards in the southwestern part of Idaho using an off-the-shelf unmanned aerial system (UAS), equipped with a multispectral camera (near-infrared, green, blue). The image processing algorithm included contrast stretching of the three bands to enhance the image and thresholding segmentation method to detect the <b>peach</b> <b>blossoms.</b> Initial results showed that the image processing algorithm could detect <b>peach</b> <b>blossoms</b> with an average detection rate of 84. 3 % and demonstrated good potential as a monitoring tool for orchard management...|$|R
