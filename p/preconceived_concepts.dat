40|$|International audienceDuring the World War I, new {{devices and}} new methods for waging war were {{developed}} and applied. Among these, the Italian phonotelemetry, sound-ranging techniques for {{the determination of}} the position of enemy artillery by the sound emitted by its fire. This paper considers how research in sound detection, which involved mathematicians and their knowledge, became part of the Office of Inventions directed by Vito Volterra. The aim is to situate the scientific instrument in its working context and to show, in particular, how a <b>preconceived</b> <b>concept</b> of precision makes no sense when considered according to the logic of military use. In the case of the Italian device, which relied on human rather than automatic listeners, I will show in particular how the instrument, though rudimentary when in comparison to those of the Allies, especially the French, was actually more efficient in the context in which it was used...|$|R
40|$|Benjamin Britten’s {{life and}} music {{have been the}} subject of study from early in his musical career. Current trends in {{psychological}} analysis of Britten’s music tend to focus on common themes, such as homosexuality, pacifism, the sense of the outsider, and the loss of innocence. Similarly, theoretical analyses tend either to provide general categorizations of the technical elements in Britten’s music or to apply a singular <b>preconceived</b> <b>concept</b> as a tool for understanding his compositions. These approaches have yielded significant information but leave aspects of Britten’s personality and music unilluminated. Britten’s Op. 47, Five Flower Songs, are a collection of five part songs for a cappella chorus that are often included within the canon of 20 th century choral literature. This paper examines a new perspective on Britten’s music by examining the relationship between Britten’s friendships and their influence on his compositions. Through the examination of these relationships information is revealed that allows for a new method of analysis that is particularly relevant to the Five Flower Songs. The opus was dedicated to two botanists for the occasion of their 25 th wedding anniversary. Contained within specific movements are extra-musical references to scientific characteristics of the flowers that are the subjects of the texts. By examining this work and important connections between other friendships and his compositional output this paper demonstrates the validity of this perspective in analyzing Britten’s life and music...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a hybrid model that combines connectionist, symbolic, and reinforcement learning for tackling reactive sequential decision tasks by a situated agent. Both procedural skills and high-level symbolic representations are acquired through an agent's experience {{interacting with the}} world, in a bottom-up direction. It deals with on-line learning, that is, learning continuously from on-going experience in the world, {{without the use of}} preconstructed data sets or <b>preconceived</b> <b>concepts.</b> The model is a connectionist one based on a two-level approach proposed earlier.

40|$|To {{deal with}} {{reactive}} sequential decision tasks, {{we present a}} learning model Clarion, which is a hybrid connectionist model consisting of both localist and distributed representations, based on the two-level approach proposed in Sun (1995). The model learns and utilizes procedural and declarative knowledge, tapping into the synergy of {{the two types of}} processes.

It addresses the following three issues: (1) It deals with concurrent on-line learning: It allows a situated agent to learn continuously from on-going experience in the world, without the use of preconstructed data sets or <b>preconceived</b> <b>concepts.</b> (2) The model learns not only low-level specific skills but [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} veracity of the economic argument which holds that through the employment of international trade protectionist policies, a country's balance of trade deficit can improve. Upon reviewing the relevant literature and establishing the theoretical framework, UK's balance of trade deficit {{has been used for}} empirical scrutiny, where the current account theories of elasticity approach and intertemporal model have been identified as key to conduct the present research; therefore, factors such as currency exchange devaluation and the relationship between national savings and country's investment have been gauged. The research has found that social-political forces play a paramount role in making trade policies and the several arguments of protection do not hold much economic support, since historical cases have demonstrated that the costs of protection outweigh the benefits in most cases. However, even then the research highlights that the <b>preconceived</b> public <b>concept</b> of a deficit in the balance of trade as harmful, might not be entirely true. that through the employment of international trade protectionist policies, a country's balance of trade deficit can improve.

40|$|O presente estudo teve como objetivo geral analisar as peculiaridades relevantes das rela??es sociais da fam?lia libanesa da obra Dois Irm?os de Milton Hatoum, apontando aspectos significativos dos personagens, e de suas rela??es {{familiar}}es. Tratou-se de um estudo descritivo e bibliogr?fico, concebido a partir das vertentes te?ricas de v?rios autores que escreveram sobre o assunto. Os resultados apresentando permitem concluir que na obra Dois Irm?os, Hatoum tra?a um perfil da fam?lia libanesa, despindo-a de qualquer conceito preconcebido, com seus personagens emergindo como figuras singulares com seus desassossegos e sob o peso do eterno conflito familiar envolvendo intrigas, inveja, ?dio, vingan?a, disputas entre irm?os, e em meio a trama que se desdobra em peda?os de mem?rias do narrador que ora revela o que viu, ora relata o que ouviu, o livro vai mostrando tamb?m fragmentos de Manaus que, sem a prosperidade do ciclo da borracha, oferece com gratid?o seus espa?os quase desabitados aos estrangeiros que por aqui chegam sem esquecer suas ra?zes e sem estranhar com alarde o habitante nativo que carrega tradi??es que desassemelham-se das suas. Assim pode-se dizer que Milton Hatoum, em sua obra, vai tra?ando os percursos hist?ricos e sociais do emigrante, ao mesmo tempo que oferece um convite para se lan?ar um olhar sobre a Amaz?niaThis study {{aimed to}} analyze the peculiarities of the relevant social relations of the Lebanese family works Two Brothers Milton Hatoum, pointing significant aspects of the characters, and their family relationships. This was a descriptive and bibliographical study, designed from the theoretical aspects of various writers on the subject. The results presented support {{the conclusion that the}} work Two Brothers, Hatoum traces a Lebanese family profile, stripping it of any <b>preconceived</b> <b>concept,</b> with their characters emerging as unique figures with their unrest and {{under the weight of the}} eternal family conflict involving intrigue, envy, hatred, revenge, disputes between siblings, and amid plot that unfolds in pieces of the narrator's memories that sometimes it revealed what he saw, now reports what he heard, the book will also show Manaus fragments that without prosperity cycle rubber, gratefully offers its nearly uninhabited areas to foreigners who arrive here without forgetting its roots and no wonder with alarm the native inhabitant who carries traditions desassemelham up from his.

40|$|There is {{a strong}} push from the WHO and the ICNIRP of {{harmonize}} national RF/MW exposure standards by individual states adopting the ICNIRP Guideline. This {{would be a good}} thing if the ICNIRP Guideline was set at an exposure level that provided sound protection of public health. The evidence presented here shows that the ICNIRP Guideline exposure level is set many orders of magnitude too high to accomplish this. It is based on the preconceived and long held view of Western Government Authorities that the only possible and only established biological effect of RF/MW exposure is tissue heating. This is referred to here as the RF-Thermal View. This view has been intransigently maintained in the face of compelling laboratory and epidemiological evidence of adverse health effects that would have had a chemical declared carcinogenic, neuropathogenic, cardiogenic and teratogenic for humans many years ago. This critique was originally written when the New Zealand Ministries of Health and Environment proposed to adopt the ICNIRP Guideline as the Public Health Standard for Cell Site exposures. At the same time the New Zealand RF Standards Committee was proposing to use the ICNIRP Guideline as the New Zealand RF/MW Standard. ICNIRP is the International Commission on Non- Ionizing Radiation Protection. The ICNIRP RF/MW guideline and scientific assessment was published in Health Physics, Vol. 74 (4) : 494 - 522, 1988. This is the primary source document for this critique and will be referred to as ICNIRP (1998). The ICNIRP (1998) assessment of effects has been reviewed against the research literature cited and other published research. It is found that both the basic approach of ICNIRP and its treatment of the scientific research have serious flaws. The ICNIRP assessment is determined to maintain the RF-Thermal View and it rejects or omits all evidence that conflicts with this view. This may be termed "Constructive Dismissal" for a <b>preconceived</b> <b>concept</b> is used to inappropriately dismiss all evidence that challenges it. ICNIRP is particularly dismissive of epidemiological evidence because all existing studies involve nonthermal exposures. Hence accepting the validity of these studies would directly challenge the RF-Thermal View. In this way the approach to dealing with health effects from non-ionizing radiation was developed to follow a completely different method than for toxic chemicals, drugs or air pollution. Both the approach of ICNIRP and the assumptions made are severely scientifically challenged in this report...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the academic literature on material culture, focusing on inherent cultural standpoints within the European {{tradition and the}} impossibility of arriving at an objective position. With regard {{to the study of}} the symbolism in Persian carpets, material science approaches the subject with a number of <b>preconceived</b> <b>concepts</b> that colour the interpretation it offers. Persian carpets have been interpreted within European art for over four hundred years, and this has led to a variety of concepts being integrated into the academic perception of them. In particular, it will be shown that methods of valuing Persian carpets over the course of the last century have come to dictate much of the basis on which their patterns and symbols are discussed. The article concludes that ultimately, material culture studies objects from within the confines of its own cultural environment, and does not offer an interpretation that is relevant to the culture in which those objects were created...|$|E
40|$|In some respects, it is {{extremely}} unfortunate that names are ever attached either to ideas or objects. The false attachment of names to ideas or objects similar but not identical with the original can work harm far exceeding the benefits conferred by having a convenient label. The name 2 ̆ 2 species 2 ̆ 2 has come to such a state. As we shall see, a species, be it plant or animal, is a fiction, a mental construct without objective existence. Animal, and plant, lines of descent exist in a four-dimensional continuum. To set up species in this continuous line of descent, we must chop it into units, and in any such process the divisions are purely arbitrary. Available information makes such a view more or less self-evident. What, then, is a 2 ̆ 2 species 2 ̆ 2 ? Instead of starting with an evolutionary line and dealing with it {{on the basis of}} <b>preconceived</b> <b>concepts,</b> working from the top down, so to speak, let us work from the bottom up. Our contention is that 2 ̆ 2 species 2 ̆ 2 have only a subjective existence. Our real biological unit is the breeding population, since it is through this ever-changing unit that the germ-plasm is passed. Taxonomy takes no notice of the breeding population, but any permanently useful taxonomic system must take account of its existence and its significance. Species and subspecies are the units with which the taxonomist deals, but they are merely convenient labels for arbitrary groupings and have only a minimum of biological meaning.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The main purpose {{of this research is}} to examine artistic thinking processes from my practical experience as an artist. This thinking process is discussed through my term: 似藝術-art-like in the context of 'practice-based research'. '似藝術-art-like' is an amalgamated form of Mandarin characters with English words; it is both a picture and a word that serves as a temporary conceptual framework that aims to keep possibility open and meaning mobile. ' Significantly,似藝術-art-like is addressed through language and artworks together with an attempt to reinterpret the relation between thinking, outcomes of thinking, and the complexity of meaning in relation to art. 似藝術-art-like operates as a temporary conceptual framework for discussing the thinking process and demonstrating the problems and contradictions in art research. This is a practice-based study so that visual and written elements and the structure of the thesis are each approached as a form of 'practice'. In addressing 似藝術-art-like in the written elements of the thesis, a series of stratagems or gambits are employed that attempt to explain or find formulation for the developing thinking process in art research. Each gambit is a form of artifice that serves to demonstrate the pursuit of addressing thinking through language as an impossible task, and functions as a manoeuvre for opening a conversation in understanding the thinking process in art. To facilitate my understanding, I explore my questioning of thinking in relation to Jacques Derrida's supplement and différance, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's rhizome, Mieke Bal's, framing, Susanne Langer's distinction between art and language, and Immanuel Kant's disinterestedness and aesthetic idea. It becomes apparent that no one theory satisfactorily explains what happens; it is too complex. Presentation of the inadequateness and contradictions in my developing process provides an examination of there being no specific answer. As a result, I conclude that utilising written words and artworks in my thinking processes and demonstrating them as physical outcomes is a process of constant confrontation with contradictions. It is a provocation that makes an artist-based researcher/research-based artist, re-think, re-disturb, re-articulate, and re-consider the conceptual frameworks in relation to developing artistic research. Ultimately, this research responds to the problems surrounding the relationship between thinking and the outcomes of thinking and meaning in relation to art. It demonstrates the difficulties and complications for seeking mobile thinking and for exploring the possibilities of artistic research. As a whole, the research points out the complexity of the process in terms of employing thinking through artworks and written words together. This invites a suspension of <b>preconceived</b> <b>concepts</b> and questions what knowledge mightbe {{in the context of an}} art enquiry...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{learning}} probabilistic models of high-level strategic behavior in the real-time strategy (RTS) game StarCraft. The models are automatically learned from sets of game logs and aim to capture the common strategic states and decision points that arise in those games. Unlike most work on behavior/strategy learning and prediction in RTS games, our data-centric approach is not biased by or limited to any set of <b>preconceived</b> strategic <b>concepts.</b> Further, since our behavior model {{is based on the}} well-developed and generic paradigm of hidden Markov models, it supports a variety of uses for the design of AI players and human assistants. For example, the learned models {{can be used to make}} probabilistic predictions of a player’s future actions based on observations, to simulate possible future trajectories of a player, or to identify uncharacteristic or novel strategies in a game database. In addition, the learned qualitative structure of the model can be analyzed by humans in order to categorize common strategic elements. We demonstrate our approach by learning models from 331 expert-level games and provide both a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the learned model’s utility...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA broad {{review is}} {{presented}} of {{recent developments in}} the commercialization of southern Africa indigenous flora for the cut flower trade, including potted flowers and foliages (“greens”). The botany, horticultural traits and potential for commercialization of several indigenous plants {{have been reported in}} several publications. The contribution of species indigenous and/or endemic to southern Africa in the development of cut flower crop plants is widely acknowledged. These include what is known in the trade as gladiolus, freesia, gerbera, ornithogalum, clivia, agapanthus, strelitzia, plumbago and protea. Despite the wealth of South African flower bulb species, relatively few have become commercially important in the international bulb industry. Trade figures on the international markets also reflect the importance of a few species of southern African origin. The development of new research tools are contributing to the commercialization of South African plants, although propagation, cultivation and post-harvest handling need to be improved. A list of commercially relevant southern African cut flowers (including those used for fresh flowers, dried flowers, foliage and potted flowers) is presented, together with a subjective evaluation of several genera and species with perceived potential for the development of new crops for the florist trade. It is concluded that research should be focused on potential markets rather than on <b>preconceived</b> product <b>concepts.</b> A special national effort is required to maximize the opportunities presented by the rich diversity of the flora and to develop an internationally competitive cut flower industry...|$|R
40|$|The Australian Assistance in Development {{organisation}} (AusAID) funded three projects {{over the}} last ten years as part of the Collaboration for Agriculture and Rural Development Program (CARD) with the initial objective to introduce Integrated Pest Management (IPM) based on mineral spray oil into citrus production in Vietnam. This objective later evolved from IPM to a broader Integrated Crop Management (ICM) approach and eventually to the introduction of procedures for Good Agricultural Practice (GAP). In this paper we discuss the evolution of the collaborative approaches in the consecutive projects, departing from making Vietnamese researchers introduce a <b>preconceived,</b> externally developed <b>concept</b> in their local socio‐economic and natural environments, to gradually facilitating the local partners to review potential innovations, test and adapt them, and develop management systems that suit the local conditions. This process resulted in linkages and interactions amongst local and international experts across disciplinary boundaries and between local stakeholders themselves. The final outcome of 15 years of collaborative work extended far beyond IPM, ICM and GAP resulting in the improved capacity of all stakeholders including farmers, extension and technical personnel from government organisations, non‐government organisations and private industry, scientists from research institutes and universities and representatives of local governments to respond to the local specific needs of farmers and the policy requirements of agricultural and rural development in Vietnam. The major outcome for Australian researchers was the realisation that humans (farmers) with their culture, habits and behaviours are a crucial part of the system in which our knowledge and technologies are to be utilised...|$|R
