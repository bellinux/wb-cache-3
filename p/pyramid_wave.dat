40|$|We {{introduce}} in {{this article}} a general formalism for Fourier based wave front sensing. To do so, we consider the filtering mask as a free parameter. Such an approach allows to unify sensors like the <b>Pyramid</b> <b>Wave</b> Front Sensor (PWFS) and the Zernike Wave Front Sensor (ZWFS). In particular, we {{take the opportunity to}} generalize this two sensors in terms of sensors' class where optical quantities as, for instance, the apex angle for the PWFS or the depth of the Zernike mask for the ZWFS become free parameters. In order to compare all the generated sensors of this two classes thanks to common performance criteria, we firstly define a general phase-linear quantity that we call meta-intensity. Analytical developments allow then to split the perfectly phase-linear behavior of a WFS from the non-linear contributions making robust and analytic definitions of the sensitivity and the linearity range possible. Moreover, we define a new quantity called the SD factor which characterizes the trade-off between these two antagonist quantities. These developments are generalized for modulation device and polychromatic light. A non-exhaustive study is finally led on the two classes allowing to retrieve the usual results and also make explicit the influence of the optical parameters introduced above...|$|E
40|$|Controlling single-particle wave {{functions}} in single semiconductor quantum dots is in demand to implement solid-state quantum information processing and spintronics. Normally, particle wave functions can be tuned transversely by an perpendicular magnetic field. We report a longitudinal wave function control in single quantum dots with a magnetic field. For a pure InAs quantum dot with {{a shape of}} pyramid or truncated <b>pyramid,</b> the hole <b>wave</b> function always occupies the base because of the less confinement at base, which induces a permanent dipole oriented from base to apex. With applying magnetic field along the base-apex direction, the hole wave function shrinks in the base plane. Because of the linear changing of the confinement for hole wave function from base to apex, the center of effective mass moves up during shrinking process. Due to the uniform confine potential for electrons, the center of effective mass of electrons does not move much, which results in a permanent dipole moment change and an inverted electron-hole alignment along the magnetic field direction. Manipulating the wave function longitudinally not only provides an alternative way to control the charge distribution with magnetic field but also a new method to tune electron-hole interaction in single quantum dots.
