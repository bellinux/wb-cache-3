40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{progression}} {{and consequences}} of aluminum toxicity were studied microscopically in the root tips of four wheat varieties representing different classes of Al tolerance. The root tips studied were collected from seedlings grown in nutrient solution cultures containing either sublethal or lethal Al treatments which were unique for each variety. The lethal treatment resulted {{in the destruction of}} both cytoplasm and nuclei throughout the root <b>primary</b> <b>meristem</b> of each variety. Some damage was sustained by root tips exposed to the sublethal treatment but if an adequate number of viable cells remained throughout the <b>primary</b> <b>meristem,</b> apical root growth could be reinitiated in an Al-free recovery solution. Reinitiation of apical root growth occurred in spite of the death and subsequent loss of the quiescent center following most sublethal Al treatments. The movement of Al into the root tip could be followed during the Al treatment by using dyes that either combined with Al. or fluoresced in ultra violet light when chelated with Al. There was strong evidence that Al penetrated the boundary between the root apex and rootcap and then, during a lethal treatment, ascended into and throughout the meristematic cells of the central cylinder. Al had also penetrated the epidermis and cortex but was prevented from entering the central cylinder by the endodermis which apparently constituted an additional barrier to the movement of Al. Ascension of Al into the central cylinder from the root apex would by-pass the barrier at the endodermis. Microscopic examination of Al injured root tips revealed that the primary effect of Al was the death of cells. Death occurred rapidly, usually within the first 24 to 48 hours of exposure to Al. The mitotic cycle, however, was affected almost {{at the onset of the}} Al. treatment. Evidence in this study suggested that the entire mitotic cycle was impeded by Al although the process of mitosis was least affected. The mitotic cycle proceeded again if the Al stress was removed before the cell's cytoplasm was completely displaced by vacuoles. The cause of varietal tolerance to Al could not be attributed to any structural feature observed through a microscopic examination of root tips from the several wheat varieties grown in this study...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe shoot {{meristem}} generates all of {{the aerial}} structures of an adult plant. It is organized in three layers which produce the epidermis (L 1 layer) and the subepidermal layers (L 2 and L 3). The origin of adult structures has previously been fate mapped to the <b>primary</b> <b>meristem</b> for L 2 and L 3 tissues. In this work we constructed a fate map of L 1 cells in the embryonic shoot meristem. Using the trichome mutationstichelas an epidermal marker, we analyzed 153 plants that included 178 sectors. Sectors on early leaves {{were found to be}} smaller and occurred more frequently than those on late leaves. Sectors on late leaves also appeared often to affect more than one leaf. In general, the width and extent of sectors were found to be variable rather than cell lineage-restricted. Our analysis allowed us to assign the most likely fates of L 1 precursor cells within the embryonic shoot meristem. The results suggest that the meristem integrates growth dynamics and patterning of all three tissues. In contrast to this coordinated growth behavior of meristematic cells, we found a difference in the lineage restrictions between the L 1 and the L 2 for the formation of axillary buds...|$|E

Four wheat varieties of widely differing tolerance to Al all behaved similarly in this respect suggesting that tolerance is a relative rather than an absolute varietal characteristic. The critical Al concentrations for four classes of tolerance were determined and the conditions for separating these classes by a rapid, precise, and convenient screening procedure was developed. The inhibition of root growth by Al could be completely overcome in all four varieties by increasing the Ca, Mg, K, or Na concentration in the Al treatment solutions.

40|$|Plants {{possess the}} rare {{capability}} {{to shape the}} own architecture according to biotic and abiotic stimuli received from the environment. Spatially defined groups of cells, called meristems, contribute to the division and differentiation processes continuously occurring inside the organism. Meristems can be classified as <b>primary</b> <b>meristems,</b> if they are specified during embryogenesis, or secondary meristems, if they form from undifferentiated, quiescent cells outside the <b>primary</b> <b>meristems.</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>meristems,</b> like the Root Apical Meristem (RAM) and the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM), coordinate the apical growth of the plant in opposite directions, while secondary meristems shape the radial architecture, regulating the thickness and branching of the primary root and shoot. Cambium is a secondary meristem which produces the vascular tissues xylem and phloem. Xylem transports water and minerals from the root to the photosynthetic tissues; it comprises lignified dead conducting cells called tracheary elements, living parenchyma cells, and lignified dead cells, called fibres, which confer mechanical support and strength. Phloem distributes glucose, RNA, viruses, and proteins from the photosynthetic sources to the sink cells; it consists of empty living sieve elements, supporting companion cells, and parenchyma cells. In order to investigate the regulation of primary and secondary growth, we developed a new chemically inducible system to control the timing and location of the induction of an effector or gene of interest. This enables us to avoid deleterious effects such as seed lethality or sterility when studying {{the role of a}} gene in a particular cell type. For example, the meristem cambium is difficult to access through normal techniques, since mutations affecting cambial cell divisions often inhibit the primary growth, too. We developed the inducible system by combining the Multi-Site Gateway cloning technology with the already extant XVE inducible system. This system was used to perform part of the research presented in the thesis. Phytohormones are involved in virtually every aspect of plant life, from development to stress response. They are small molecules which act cellautonomously or non-cell-autonomously to mediate the majority of developmental and environmental responses and, consequently, the activity of the meristems throughout the plant life cycle. Auxin and cytokinins, which were among the first phytohormones discovered, regulate almost every aspect of plant life, such as the division and differentiation processes occurring continuously in the RAM and SAM. The two phytohormones have long been known to interact, and recent studies have uncovered significant crosstalk on the level of biosynthesis, transport, signalling and degradation. We investigated the dynamic role of auxin in maintaining the balance between division, elongation, differentiation in the RAM of the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results confirm that an optimal level of auxin response is required for division and elongation, while differentiation mechanisms require just a minimal concentration of auxin to proceed normally. We discovered that auxin and cytokinin responses interact synergistically to specify the stem cells and to regulate the timing of divisions in the cambium of Arabidopsis thaliana. The auxin and cytokinin signalling pathways both have a positive role in triggering secondary growth, but the hierarchy of the crosstalk between them is still unclear. Finally, auxin transported via the AUX 1 /LAX auxin influx carriers regulates the differentiation of vessel elements in the later stages of root cambium development. In summary, we confirm that auxin and cytokinins behave as master regulators of meristematic activities throughout the root, as the signalling pathways associated with both phytohormones heavily influence primary and secondary growth...|$|R

30|$|The {{pattern of}} embryo {{development}} in flowering plants {{can be divided}} into several phases (Goldberg et al. 1994). Once the polar axis is established with the formation of the proembryo, histodifferentiation begins with the formation of a shoot and a root apical <b>meristems,</b> the <b>primary</b> <b>meristems</b> (protoderm, ground meristem, and procambium), and the cotyledon(s). Upon the completion of the histodifferentiation phase, storage product synthesis and accumulation begins within embryo cells. Concomitant with storage product accumulation, the maturation phase sets in and the embryo will acquire desiccation tolerance and prepares for developmental arrest and germination events. This pattern of development contributes to the success and survival of flowering plants in the natural habitats. In lower vascular plants such as bryophytes and ferns, once the histodifferentiation phase is completed, the embryo will germinate immediately without a resting phase, as {{they do not have the}} ability to undergo storage product biosynthesis and developmental arrest. Moreover, in flowering plants, given the right conditions, developing embryo can also precociously germinate (Raghavan 1997) after the completion of the histodifferentiation phase, as the embryo has already established a functional body plan ready for germination.|$|R

This variation is largely a result of differences in {{the arrangement of the}} paraclades. Based on the analysis of stem architecture of all 25 species of Actinocephalus, the following patterns were established: (1) leaf rosette, with no elongated axis, instead the axillary paraclades originating directly from the short aerial stem, (2) rosette axis continuing into an elongated axis with spirally arranged paraclades, (3) an elongated axis originating from a rhizome, with ramified paraclades, and (4) an elongated axis originating from a short aerial stem, with paraclades arranged in a subwhorl. The elongated axis exhibits indeterminate growth only in pattern 4. Patterns 3 and 4 are found exclusively in Actinocephalus; pattern I occurs in many other genera of Eriocaulaceae, while pattern 2 is also found in Syngonanthus and Paepalanthus. Anatomically, each stem structure (i. e., paraclade, elongated axis, short aerial stem, rhizome) is thickened in a distinctive way and this can be used to distinguish them. Specifically, elongated axes and paraclades lack thickening, thickening of short aerial stems results from the <b>primary</b> thickening <b>meristem</b> and/or the secondary thickening meristem.

Cell rejuvenation, loss of the capacity to organize meristematic centers, and loss of totipotency are proposed to define plant cancer through this neoplastic progression of a callus. Habituated tissues share many morphological and biochemical similarities with so-called vitreous shoots from micropropagation. Vitrification and hyperhydric malformations of shoots raised in vitro may be considered as steps of another neoplastic progression, which leads to cancerisation also in the absence of introduced oncogenic pathogens. In this case death of the whole organism occurs either through direct apex necrosis or indirectly, from the loss of the capacity for the <b>primary</b> <b>meristems</b> to function normally, which gives rise to completely anarchic structures.

However, our understanding of pO 2 regulation in complex meristematic organs such as buds is incomplete, and particularly lacks spatial resolution. Methods: The gradients in pO 2 from the outer scales to the <b>primary</b> <b>meristem</b> complex were measured in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) buds, together with respiratory CO 2 production rates and the accumulation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, from ecodormancy through the first 72 h preceding bud burst, triggered by the transition from low to ambient temperatures. Key Results: Steep internal pO 2 gradients were measured in dormant buds with values as low as 2. 5 kPa found in the core of the bud prior to bud burst. Respiratory CO 2 production rates increased soon after the transition from low to ambient temperatures and the bud tissues gradually became oxygenated in a patterned process. Within 3 h of the transition to ambient temperatures, superoxide accumulation was observed in the cambial meristem, co-localising with lignified cellulose associated with pro-vascular tissues. Thereafter, superoxide accumulated in other areas subtending the apical meristem complex, in the absence of significant hydrogen peroxide accumulation, except in the cambial meristem. By 72 h, the internal pO 2 gradient showed a biphasic profile, where the minimum pO 2 was external to the core of the bud complex. Conclusions: Spatial and temporal control of the tissue oxygen environment occurs within quiescent buds, and the transition from quiescence to bud burst is accompanied by a regulated relaxation of the hypoxic state and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the developing cambium and vascular tissues of the heterotrophic grapevine buds...|$|E

In the framework of the EU R&D project Hemp-sys [QLRT- 01 - 01363] the potential of hemp as a feedstock in textile processing is investigated. Therefore, a detailed study on the effects of agronomy and fibre extraction processing on fibre properties for textile processing has been carried out. To relate the crop growing conditions with fibre quality and productivity it is required that information is obtained on hemp bast fibre formation. At various stages of the plant development the fibre development has been monitored by microscopic techniques. The two distinct bast fibre types occurring in hemp-the so called primary and secondary fibres-show different and independent development. The primary fibres appear earlier in the development in the rapid growth stage and are formed from the <b>primary</b> <b>meristem</b> in the outer layers (phloem). Primary fibres are thick, extremely long and with compact cell walls and small lumen and are present from bottom to top of the plant. In contrast, the secondary fibres are formed in later stages during thickness growth from the secondary meristem. Secondary fibres are thinner, shorter and with higher lignin content than the primary fibres. In early developmental stages secondary fibres only occur {{at the bottom of the}} stem. Substantial secondary fibre formation is observed at the start of flowering or when the plants grow taller than 2. 25 m and/or thicker than approximately 1 cm. Based upon these observations a selection of conditions can be made for growing and harvesting of hemp to obtain the best quality fibre for textile processing. To produce a crop with maximum amount of primary fibres free from secondary fibres, the recommended practice is to grow hemp at high seed density to avoid thickness growth and to harvest the hemp stems around flowering of the plants...|$|E

Fusarium niveum invades at first the root cap (fig. 1), and then into the primodial meristem, or directly attacks the <b>primary</b> <b>meristem</b> of the host plant (fig. 2, 3, 4). Then the fungus makes its way into the stele, penetrating through the meristematic tissue intercellulary and intracellulary (fig. 5, 6, 7). After the fungs gains its position in the stele, it progresses vigourously along the xylem elements, destructing the invaded tissues, for which any response of the host plant can not be found. In this way, finally, the wilting is resulted. When Fusarium niveum reaches the host tissue, e. g. root cap or protoderm or piliferous layer, the fungus penetrates the host tissue intercellulary; and no intracellular penetration through the living tissue is observed. The fungus which penetrated through young piliferous layer intercellulary into primary cortex (fig. 8, 9, 10), may be destructive to this parenchymatous tissue and may cause a blight of this region, but it cannot enter the stele to cause wilt of the host, in consequence of the premature suberization of the endodermis. As soon as the physiological function of the root hair is ended, the piliferous layer cells may produce the suberized exodermis cells. And by the protective action of the suberized exodermis the causal fungus is entirely refused. to enter inner tissue (fig. 11, 12). Although the fungus ma y invade the cortex of a root through a rapture produced by the emergence of a seondary root, it may not be allowed into the stele, {{because of the presence of}} the endodermis which is just suberized by the wound stimulus of the root tissue, owing to the emergence of the new root. Within sixteen hours, at 23 ℃, the fungus may penetrate the root cap and enter the meristematic tissue. The mode of infection of the host tissue by this fungus may well be called as 2 ̆ 2 Meristematic infection, 2 ̆ 2 because, its infection is successful only when the meristematic tissue is invaded. 本稿は西瓜の蔓割病 (麥凋病) の病理學的研究の一部をなすものであつて, 主として, 本病原菌が健全なる西瓜の根のどの部位より有效的に侵入するものであるかを探究したものである。本菌は西瓜の幼根の先端なる根冠を通過してその原始分裂組織に侵人し, 或は根冠の側方より直接初生分裂組織に侵入する。然る後根の心柱内に進んでこゝに繁殖し, つひに寄主をして特異なる麥凋と云ふ病徴を現はしむるのである。病原菌が根冠又は直接幼組織に侵入する際には最初その細胞間隙に潛入するのを常とするが既に幼組織内に侵入した菌絲は幼組織の細胞間を侵すのみならず容易に細胞膜を破壞して進むものである。初生永久組織に對しては, (A) 未だ根毛が充分に生え揃はない時分に於ては菌絲は根表皮細胞の中間膜を破つて内部に侵人し, 先づ細胞間隙に沿つて蔓延し, かくて根表皮に近き皮部組織より次第に内部へと組織を破壞しつゝ進むのである。然しながらかゝる侵害をなしたる病菌も, 皮部の内方の内皮層の早期栓質化の爲に阻止せられて心柱内へ侵入することは不可能である。(B) 根毛の充分に生え揃つた時よりその末期に至る時期に於ては病原菌は依然常に根表皮細胞の中間膜を侵して内部へ侵入せんとし, 直接根毛に侵入したものを發見しない。又根表皮の中間膜を破つて皮部を侵すに至つたものも, 前同樣内皮の栓質化の爲に心柱内へは侵入が出來ない, (C) 根毛の脱落したる後の組織に於ては, 根表皮の直下に發達して來た外皮の栓質化の爲に菌は全く阻止せられて皮部をも侵すことが出來ない。更に側根の發生によつて生じた皮部より根表皮に至る破壞溝に對して本菌が侵害することがあつても, 主根より側根に亘れる内皮の廣汎なる栓質化の爲に, それらの心柱内に侵入することは不可能である。即ち本菌は幼組織に對して侵入し得た場合にのみ, その侵入の目的を達して根の心柱内にその位置を占めることが出來るのであつて, 既に初生永久組織へと分化したる後に於ては, その寄主の皮部侵害は組織の局部的崩壞を結果するのみであつて麥凋病とは直接的交渉のないものである。本菌が寄主組織に侵入するのは極めて短時間であつて, 23 度の元に於ては 16 時間前後にして既に根冠部を通過して幼組織内に侵人し了つてゐるのである。著者は本菌が寄主の幼組織に侵入することによつて初めてその侵入の效果を塞げるものであることを指摘し, この侵入法を幼組織侵入とした...|$|E

The disease is {{characterized}} by the development of a whip-like structure from the <b>primary</b> <b>meristems,</b> where billions of teliospores are produced. Sugarcane smut also causes tillering and low sucrose and high fiber contents, reducing cane productivity. We investigated the biological events contributing to disease symptoms in a smut intermediate-resistant sugarcane genotype by examining the transcriptional profiles (RNAseq) shortly after inoculating the plants and immediately after whip emission. The overall picture of disease progression suggests that premature transcriptional reprogramming of the shoot meristem functions continues until the emergence of the whip. The guidance of this altered pattern is potentially primarily related to auxin mobilization in addition to the involvement of other hormonal imbalances. The consequences associated with whip emission are the modulation of typical meristematic functions toward reproductive organ differentiation, requiring strong changes in carbon partitioning and energy production. These changes include the overexpression of genes coding for invertases and trehalose- 6 P synthase, as well as other enzymes from key metabolic pathways, such as from lignin biosynthesis.

The PTM produces the inner cortical parenchyma, endodermis, pericycle and amphivasal vascular bundles, which are {{formed by the}} procambium too. After the primary body differentiates, cellular divisions continue only in the pericycle, and originate an irregular vascular system with vessel elements shorter and more branched than {{those found in the}} primary growth. This change of activity in the pericycle defines a secondary growth, where the secondary thickening meristem (STM) is the pericycle itself...|$|R

40|$|A major {{proportion}} of plant biomass {{is derived from}} the activity of the cambium, a lateral meristem responsible for vascular tissue formation and radial organ enlargement in a process termed secondary growth. In contrast to our relatively good understanding of the regulation of <b>primary</b> <b>meristems,</b> remarkably little is known concerning the mechanisms controlling secondary growth, particularly how cambial cell divisions are regulated and integrated with vascular differentiation. A genetic loss-of-function approach was used here to reveal a rate-limiting role for the Arabidopsis CYCLIN D 3 (CYCD 3) subgroup of cell-cycle genes in the control of cambial cell proliferation and secondary growth, providing conclusive evidence of a direct link between the cell cycle and vascular development. It is shown that all three CYCD 3 genes are specifically expressed in the cambium throughout vascular development. Analysis of a triple loss-of-function CYCD 3 mutant revealed a requirement for CYCD 3 in promoting the cambial cell cycle since mutant stems and hypocotyls showed a marked reduction in diameter linked to reduced mitotic activity in the cambium. Conversely, loss of CYCD 3 provoked an increase in xylem cell size and the expression of differentiation markers, showing that CYCD 3 is required to restrain the differentiation of xylem precursor cells. Together, our data show that tight control of cambial cell division through developmental- and cell type-specific regulation of CYCD 3 is required for normal vascular development, constituting part of a novel mechanism controlling organ growth in higher plants...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims Reconstructions have {{identified}} the 20 th century as being uniquely warm in the last 1000 years. Changes in the phenology of <b>primary</b> <b>meristems</b> converged toward increases in length of the growing season. Has the phenology of secondary meristem changed during the last century, and to what extent? Methods Timings of wood formation in black spruce, Picea mariana, were monitored for 9 years on a weekly timescale at four sites in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. Models for assessing xylem phenology were defined and applied to reconstruct onset, ending and duration of xylogenesis between 1950 and 2010 using thermal thresholds on chronologies of maximum and minimum temperatures. Key Results All sites exhibited increasing trends of both annual and May–September temperatures, with the greatest changes observed at the higher latitudes. Phenological events in spring were more affected than those occurring in autumn, with cambial resumptions occurring 0 · 5 – 0 · 8 d decade− 1 earlier. The duration of xylogenesis has lengthened significantly since 1950, although the models supplied wide ranges of variations, between 0 · 07 and 1 · 5 d decade− 1, respectively. Conclusions The estimated changes in past cambial phenology demonstrated the marked effects of the recent increase in temperature on the phenological traits of secondary meristems. In the long run, the advancement of cambial activity could modify the short time window for growth of boreal species and dramatically affect the dynamics and productivity of trees in these temperature-limited ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} {{secondary}} xylem and phloem {{depends on the}} division of cells in the vascular cambium and results {{in an increase in}} the diameter of the root and stem. Very {{little is known about the}} genetic mechanisms that control cambial activity and the differentiation of secondary xylem and phloem cell types. To begin to identify new genes required for vascular cell differentiation and function, we performed genome-wide expression profiling of xylem and phloem-cambium isolated from the root-hypocotyl of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Gene expression in the remaining nonvascular tissue was also profiled. From these transcript profiles, we assembled three sets of genes with expression significantly biased toward xylem, phloemcambium, or nonvascular tissue. We also assembled three two-tissue sets of genes with expression significantly biased toward xylem/phloem-cambium, xylem/nonvascular, or phloem-cambium/nonvascular tissues. Localizations predicted by transcript profiles were supported by results from promoter-reporter and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments with nine xylem- or phloem-cambium-biased genes. An analysis of the members of the phloem-cambium gene set suggested that some genes involved in regulating <b>primary</b> <b>meristems</b> are also regulators of the cambium. Secondary phloem was implicated in the synthesis of auxin, glucosinolates, cytokinin, and gibberellic acid. Transcript profiles also supported the importance of class III HD ZIP and KANADI transcription factors as regulators of radial patterning during secondary growth, and identified several members of the G 2 -like, NAC, AP 2, MADS, and MYB transcription factor families that may play roles as regulators of xylem or phloem cell differentiation and activity...|$|R
40|$|The genetic {{basis of}} stem cell {{specification}} in somatic embryogenesis and organogenesis is still obscure. SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK) genes are involved in embryogenesis and organogenesis in numerous species. In vitro culture of Cyclamen persicum immature ovules provides a system for investigating stem cell formation and maintenance, because lines forming either organs or embryos or callus without organs/embryos are available for the same cultivar and plant growth regulator conditions. The present aim was to exploit this property of cyclamen cultures to understand the role of SERK(s) in stem cell formation and maintenance in somatic embryogenesis and organogenesis in vitro, in comparison with expression in planta. CpSERK 1 and CpSERK 2 were isolated from embryogenic callus. CpSERK 1 and CpSERK 2 levels by RT-PCR showed that expression is high in embryogenic, moderate in organogenic, and null in recalcitrant calli. in situ hybridizations showed that the expression of both genes started in clumps of pluripotent stem cells, from which both pre-embryogenic aggregates and organ meristemoids derived, and continued in their trans-amplifying, meristem-like, derivatives. Expression declined in organ meristemoids, in parallel with a partial loss of meristematization. In mature somatic embryos, and in shoot and root primordia, CpSERK 1 and CpSERK 2 were expressed in meristems, and similar patterns occurred in zygotic embryo and <b>primary</b> <b>meristems</b> in planta. The results point to SERK 1 and SERK 2 as markers of pluripotency in cyclamen. It is proposed that the high expression of these genes in the trans-amplifying derivatives of the stem cells maintains a pluripotent condition leading to totipotency and, consequently, somatic embryogenesis...|$|R
40|$|SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK) genes {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} {{to play a role}} in somatic embryogenesis in several plant species. As more is learnt about these genes, the view of their role in plant development has broadened. The Medicago truncatula MtSERK 1 gene has been associated with somatic embryogenesis and in vitro root formation. In order to study the role of MtSERK 1 in development further, the MtSERK 1 promoter sequence has been isolated and cloned into a promoter–GUS analysis vector. SERK 1 promoter-driven GUS expression was studied in A. tumefaciens-transformed cultures and regenerated plants, in A. rhizogenes-transformed root clones, and in nodulation. In embryogenic cultures, GUS staining is detected after 2 d of culture at the edge of the explant and around vascular tissue. Expression at the explant edge intensifies over subsequent days and then is lost from the edge as callus formation moves inward. MtSERK 1 expression appears to be associated with new callus formation. When somatic embryos form, GUS staining occurs throughout embryo development. Zygotic embryos show expression until the heart stage. The in planta studies reveal a number of interesting expression patterns. There appear to be three types. (i) Expression associated with the <b>primary</b> <b>meristems</b> of the root and shoot and the newly formed meristems of the lateral roots and nodule. (ii) Expression at the junction between one type of tissue or organ and another. (iii) Expression associated with the vascular tissue procambial cells.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Developmental {{changes in}} the storage organ of Brassica campestris L. were {{followed}} from {{the organization of the}} embryonic radicle and hypocotyl to the mature storage organ. Three independent <b>primary</b> <b>meristems</b> gave rise to the cortex, the stele, and the root cap-epidermis. The primary development is typical of the Cruciferae. Cambial activity was followed through serial tangential sections of the phloem from four areas of the storage organ; the crown, the hypocotyl, the upper root and the middle root. The anticlinal divisions of the crown's cambium were primarily longitudinal and transverse. The divisions in the hypocotyl, although greatly oblique had fewer 'longitudinal divisions. The cambium of the upper root had fewer longitudinal and greatly oblique anticlinal divisions. The anticlinal divisions of the middle root showed few greatly oblique divisions with most divisions being oblique to slightly oblique. New ray initials originated by transverse divisions of fusiform initials. Both ray and fusiform initials that were lost differentiated into parenchyma cells. Decline of fusiform initials was rare and in no case did ray initials originate in this fashion. As the storage organ expanded, interxylary phloem strands and vascular bundles appeared. Phloem strands differentiated following longitudinal divisions of the axial xylem parenchyma. As the organ enlarged, parenchyma cells surrounding the phloem strand divided, a cambium was formed, and tertiary phloem and xylem were produced. These interxylary vascular bundles formed a network which in the upper hypocotyl united to form a continuous band between the xylem and the pith. In the crown the vascular bundles of the basal leaves are bicolateral and the internal phloem is continuous with that of the interxylary phloem...|$|R
40|$|Early {{events in}} embryo {{development}} {{are critical for}} the plant body formation. During this phase the apical-basal axis, the radial symmetry, and the <b>primary</b> <b>meristems</b> are specified. The shoot apical meristem (SAM) and the root apical meristem (RAM) will subsequently give rise to all above-ground and below-ground tissues. Despite the environmental and economical importance of conifers, the regulation of their embryonic development is still relatively unknown. We are using somatic embryos of Norway spruce as a model system for studying embryology in conifers. In this thesis, I show that polar auxin transport (PAT) is essential for proper patterning of both apical and basal parts of conifer embryos. Blocked PAT caused increased auxin levels, increased differentiation of early somatic embryos, a skewed balance between the embryonal mass and the suspensor cells in late embryos, and an abnormal morphology with irregular RAM, fused or aborted cotyledons and absence of a functional SAM in mature embryos. Two NAC gene family members (PaNAC 01 and PaNAC 02), {{closely related to the}} Arabidopsis CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON (CUC) genes, were characterized. PaNAC 01 harbors previously characterized functional motifs, and could complement the cuc 1 cuc 2 double mutant. The temporal expression of PaNAC 01 was dependent on PAT, and coincided with the formation of separated cotyledons and a functional SAM. Furthermore, the expression profiles of four KNOXI genes (HBK 1 to 4) showed that also the expression of HBK 2 and HBK 4 depend on PAT, and indicated their role in embryo differentiation and SAM formation, while HBK 1 and HBK 3 seemingly have a more general role during embryo development. In addition, a global gene expression analysis revealed important processes during early somatic embryogenesis in Norway spruce. Taken together the results show that central parts of the regulatory network for embryo development are still conserved between angiosperms and gymnosperms, despite their separation 300 million years ago...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} several years, {{intermediates}} in the reduction of dioxygen have been attributed diverse functional roles ranging from protection against pathogen attack to the regulation of cellular development. Evidence now suggests that parasitic angiosperms, which naturally commit to virulence through the growth of new organs, depend on reduced oxygen intermediates, or reactive oxygen species (ROS), for signal generation. Clearly, the role of ROS in both plant defense and other physiological responses complicates any models that employ these intermediates in host plant recognition.
