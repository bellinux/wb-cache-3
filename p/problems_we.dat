[...] Lê Duẩn promised the Vietnamese people in 1976 that each family would own a radio set, refrigerator and TV within ten years; he seemed to believe he could easily integrate the South Vietnamese consumer society with agrarian North Vietnam. In 1976 the 4th National Congress declared Vietnam would complete its socialist transformation within twenty years. This optimism proved unfounded; instead Vietnam staggered from one economic crisis to another.|$|E

Speaking of the errors and overall attitude surrounding the Apollo program before the accident, he stated: [...] "We were too 'gung-ho' about the schedule and we blocked out all of the <b>problems</b> <b>we</b> saw each day in our work. Every element of the program was in trouble and so were we." [...] He reminded the team of the perils and mercilessness of their endeavor, and stated the new requirement that every member of every team in mission control be [...] "tough and competent", requiring nothing less than perfection throughout NASA's programs. In 2003, following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe quoted Kranz's speech, applying it to the Columbia crew.|$|E
