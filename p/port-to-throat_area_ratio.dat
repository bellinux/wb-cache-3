An adjustable <b>port-to-throat</b> <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> allows {{high and low}} port Mach numbers to be evaluated at multiple pressures. Head, mid, and aft motor pressure instrumentation as well as aft burning rate measurements using an ultrasonic transducer provide the necessary information about {{the operation of the}} motor. Erosive burning was studied using the classical Lenoir Robillard model, a modified form of Dickenson 2 ̆ 7 s model, the Thompson McClure model, and the Saderholm model. Erosive burning parameter estimates were made by fitting to an inferred burning rate based upon pressure measurements and by matching to pressure reconstructions. The experiment covers chamber conditions ranging from 300 psi to 700 psi and port Mach numbers from 0. 1 to 0. 7. Data and reconstructions of 8 tests are included and indicate that the Lenoir Robillard model is best suited of the models considered to estimate erosive burning using inferred burning rate alone. In addition, no significant differences were observed in regards to erosive burning for the PBAN and HTPB propellants studied herein. ...|$|E

The flame spreading rate is calculated by successive heating-to-ignition along the propellant surface.

This can {{play a major role}} in the performance of a solid rocket motor depending on the geometry of that motor. A 2 -D slab combustor has been developed for the study of erosive burning.

Thermocouples were added to the original design to help gather burnout data from the tests. A ballistic element model has also been developed and has been used to analyze the tests using the classical Lenoir-Robillard erosive burning model. Although the test data that has been gathered seems reliable and consistent, reconstructing the tests with the ballistic model has proven difficult. This is likely do to the limitations of the Lenoir-Robillard erosive burning model and a new model would be required to better match the test data. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Basic {{experiment}} for estimating a solid contact <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> {{of dried}} interface by longitudinal ultrasonic wave pulses is attempted. The <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> is estimated by echo height ratio H defined by sound pressure which depends on central frequency in one cycle of received waves. H is different by distance and topography {{of the solid}} contact part and wavelength, even if the solid contact <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> is same. However, one law is clarified by arranging this relation with dimensionless distance Λ(=ι/λ) which depends on the distance ι of the solid contact point and the wavelength λ. H is shown by a curve which depends only on the solid contact <b>area</b> <b>ratio,</b> and then, it for any <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> monotonously approaches the non-contacting <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> with increasing Λ. This tendency shows that the solid contact <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> can be directly estimated from the echo height ratio measured by using the high frequency probe. Since the attenuation of the high frequency wave is remarkable, however, {{there is a limit}} of the measurement thickness. Therefore, the measurement by the low frequency probe is required. H in this region is not decided only by the non-contacting area and rapidly approaches to zero with decreasing Λ. The behaviour of this H is governed with the stiffness of contacting two surfaces. Then, the equation for the estimation of the contact <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> considering the effect of this stiffness is proposed.

Piston and cylinder bore contacts invariably operate in boundary lubrication {{regime and the}} risk for seizure of these contacts is high particularly when lubricated with low-viscosity lubricants. The piston assembly in a radial piston hydraulic motor has conformal (area) contact. In this work, these contacts have been simulated in the laboratory by using a thrust washer test configuration.

METHODS: Our retrospective, interventional case series study involved 30 consecutive cases affected by orbital fractures and diplopia undergoing surgical correction within 7 days after injury. To evaluate ocular motility disturbance, we measured the involved ocular motility range by use of a manual Hess screen test before and 4 months after surgery. The percentage of Hess <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> % was used to express the range of ocular motility in a numerical value. RESULTS: All patients with preoperative Hess <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> > 85 % had no postoperative diplopia, and most patients (57 %) having a preoperative Hess <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> < 65 % had postoperative diplopia.

40|$|The {{modeling}} {{analyses of}} the mass <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> of the flat-plate and evacuated tubular solar water systems were conducted based on the daily solar radiation model and the solar collector energy output model in the paper. The {{results show that the}} simulations of the mass <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> are well consistent with the experimental data and their relative errors do not exceed 10 %. The mass <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> of the solar collector integrated in large-tilt-angle (70 °- 90 °) with south facades of the residential buildings in five meteorologic regions including 133 cities in China were calculated and analyzed. For convenient use in practice, parameter correlations between the mass <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> of solar hot water systems and the main meteorologic variables were analyzed by using the linear polynomial regression technique. The correlations of solar hot water systems used in summer and winter were been given in the paper. These results give a useful tool to calculate and improve the mass <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> of the solar collector integration in large-tilt-angle with the south facades of buildings...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} {{investigation}} the distribution of mean velocity, static pressure and total pressure are experimentally studied on a C-shape diffuser of 40 ° angle of turn with an <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. 278 and centerline length was chosen as three times of inlet diameter. The experimental results then were numerically validated {{with the help of}} Fluent and then a series of parametric investigations are conducted with same centre line length and inlet diameter but with different <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> varying from 1. 25 to 3. 5. The measurements were taken at Reynolds number 2. 25 x 10 5 based on inlet diameter and mass average inlet velocity. Predicted results of coefficient of mass averaged static pressure recovery (50 %) and coefficient of mass averaged total pressure loss (11 %) are in good agreement with the experimental results of coefficient of mass averaged static pressure recovery (47 %) and coefficient of mass averaged total pressure loss (10 %) respectively. Standard k-ε model in Fluent solver was chosen for validation. From the parametric investigation it is observed that for the increase in <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> static pressure recovery increases sharply upto <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> 2 after that increment in lesser gradient up to 2. 67 and it was maximum at <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> 2. 67. But when <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> increases from 2. 67 to 3. 5, pressure recovery decreases steadily. The coefficient of total pressure loss almost remains constant with the change in <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> and angle of turn for similar inlet conditions.

40|$|A two {{dimensional}} momentum integral {{analysis was used}} to examine the effect of changing inlet <b>area</b> <b>ratio,</b> diffuser <b>area</b> <b>ratio,</b> and the ratio of ejector length to width. A relatively wide range of these parameters was considered. It was found that for constant inlet <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> the augmentation increases with the ejector length, and for constant length: width ratio the augmentation increases with inlet <b>area</b> <b>ratio.</b> Scale model tests were used to verify these trends and to examine th effect of aspect ratio. On the basis of these results, an ejector configuration was selected for fabrication and testing at a scale representative of an ejector wing aircraft. The test ejector was powered by a Pratt-Whitney F 401 engine developing approximately 12, 000 pounds of thrust. The results of preliminary tests indicate that the ejector develops a thrust augmentation ratio better than 1. 65...|$|R
40|$|Forty-six {{consecutive}} {{patients with}} pulmonary embolism (PE) who underwent pulmonary angiography, helical computed tomography (CT), and echocardiography in the investigators' emergency department were studied. It {{was determined that}} the CT right ventricular (RV) /left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> was correlated with PE obstruction and echocardiography. A CT RV/LV <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> &gt; 1 had a sensitivity of 88 % and a specificity of 88 % in diagnosing significant PE.
