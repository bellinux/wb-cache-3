40|$|Magic Forest is a time-based/sculptural {{piece of}} work that was {{produced}} for an art exhibition in the science Museum in London. It was funded by an AHRC grant. It was exhibited in the Science Museum, London. Since then it has gained some status as a work that reflects the developing complexity of the brain. The final work ‘Magic Forest’ was shown at the Science Museum in March 2002, at the Rotterdam Film Festival, Rotterdam, Holland, 2003 and at the Natuurmuseum, Rotterdam, a show called ‘Mensbeeld’, in 2004, in ‘Simply Complex’ at the Design Museum in Zurich in 2005, and in ‘Neuroculture’, at the Westport Art Centre in Connecticut, USA in 2006. It {{has been written about}} in a number of books and photographs of it have appeared. The Wellcome Trust have commissioned a permanent sculptural version of Magic Forest which is on display in their new <b>public</b> <b>access</b> <b>building</b> in Eston Road, London. [...] Magic Forest: an introduction The work arose from a collaboration with Dr Richard Wingate, of the Medical Research Council Centre for Developmental Neurology, at Kings College, London. The work tracks the development, proliferation, and organisation of neurones in the growing brain. The work reflects 1. The changing organisation in the brain, developing to being capable of holding memories, and 2. The process of collecting the raw data for such scientific work through the use of the laser confocal microscope. The work starts with the location of the growing brain in the skull and proceeds with an ever-growing forest of neurones developing on the screens; the mass increases, filling the whole screen with layers and layers of neurones in different colours. The work ends when the system collapses and the neurones disappear, blackness returns and the skull is shown again getting larger and larger and the work begins to cycle around once more. Each cycle lasts about fifteen minutes. The colours in the work reflect the fluorescence used and seen in the staining of individual neurones, which produce the images under the confocal microscope. Slices and snapshots: reconstructing brain cells. The brain consists of millions of neurons, each a finely branching microscopic structure that reaches out for near and distant neighbours; they contribute to a distributed circuitry whose logic remains one of the greatest mysteries of biology. Structure and function are synonymous. The geometry of the neuron determines its interconnections and is a physical manifestation of the functional processing of the electrical signals it receives. The complexity and beauty of its structure also reflects the developmental constraints that shaped its growth. Over a hundred years ago, the pioneer anatomist, Santiago Ramon y Cajal, sliced up resin-impregnated brains which had been stained by a capricious potassium dichromate-silver process invented by Camillo Golgi. For reasons that are still not fully understood, a few cells in a thousand turn completely black, their fine processes packed with dense particles. By studying the fragments of cell distributed through the thin slices of brain, individual neurons were imaginatively reconstructed and giving rise to a model of the cellular composition of different brain regions, their interconnections and even the direction of the flow of information. Prior to Golgi's stain the very existence of cells in the brain was hotly debated. Contrary evidence suggested that the brain was a continuous mesh of interconnected fibres. A theory that was eventually superseded, as the fine structure of neurons was uncovered {{in the early part of}} the twentieth century. Today, our understanding of the brain still requires the imaginative and computer-aided analysis of slices through brain tissue. By using fluorescent dyes, slices no longer have to be collected using a sharpened blade. Laser scanning confocal microscopes can capture sections of stained neurons optically, giving unprecedented images of the three-dimensional living brain cells retained within computer memory. Just as our concepts of neuroantaomy rely on sections of space, our ideas of how neurons grow come from snapshots in time. Neurons are born within the inner lining of the ventricular cavities that lie at the centre of the brain. They migrate into outer layers of neurons forming layers and nuclei populations of cells serving a particular function. They extend fine fibres, reaching for appropriate neighbours to communicate with. One of these, the axon, contributes to information highways connecting distant regions of the brain. Finally, connections and fibres are remodelled as information itself shapes the structure of individual cells. Piecing together brain cell structure at different time-points has begun to give clues as to how cells might interact and shape themselves as they grow. However our model of brain development is still derived from glimpses of individual cells or by identifying populations by means which inevitably obscure the fine details of individual cells. Sections and snapshots remain, for the time being, the basis of our understanding of neuroanatomy.

40|$|International audienceThe {{diversity}} of chemicals used in hospitals (detergents-disinfectants, alcohol-based hand sanitizers, drugs, etc.) and {{recent developments in}} indoor air quality regulation of <b>public</b> <b>access</b> <b>buildings</b> require {{a better understanding of}} chemical risks in this particular environment. We developed a methodology for semi-quantitative chemical risk assessments in this environment to prioritize inhalation risks by sector and chemical. This methodology is based on a similar approach in the workplace that defines classes of exposures and of hazards. Their combination produces a risk matrix. Four criteria were used to determine the exposure classes: quantity and frequency of the chemical's use, volatility (vapor pressure), and the type of collective protective equipment associated with each area. The hazard class is also derived from four criteria: classification as carcinogenic, mutagenic, or toxic to reproduction, the existence of a toxicity reference value, occupational exposure limit values, and risk phrases (official risk descriptions, on labels, data sheets, etc). This methodology was tested in the Rennes University Hospital (Rennes, France) in five different hospital areas, with a specific survey undertaken to collect data about chemicals in each area. The results show the spatial specificity of chemical risks. Among the various sites analysed, the chemical risks of two require priority attention: the parasitology-mycology laboratory and patients' rooms. Because of their wide use in the hospital and the volatility of some of their components (alcohols), detergents-disinfectants contribute to increasing risk levels in all areas. The model is therefore discriminatory in terms of areas and substances...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{accessibility}} of buildings to {{everyone is a}} fundamental right today. For already 15 years, the access to establishments or collective houses is regulated as shows the French decree 94. 86 of January 26 th, 1994 defining which types of statutory arrangements must be applied. It is a precursor decree {{to the law of}} February, 2005, which law imposes the stake in conformity of all the <b>public</b> <b>access</b> <b>buildings.</b> But buildings are not the only place where the disabled person is confronted with the problem of the accessibility. The internet, which has become today a fundamental communication tool for the access to the information and the freedom of expression, is still inaccessible under many points to the disabled persons. With the aim of remedying these lacks in accessibility, our work consists in drawing up a list of the handicap problems met by a disabled person and trying to associate it material and software technical solutions to compensate for these problems. Face to navigation on a website, the problems stressing the handicap of the person (and sometimes creating new ones) are many. We can quote two examples among the most classical: - A website which contains too much information on the same page, in a non-hierarchical basis or too bushy way, does not allow a visual deficient person to navigate serenely and effectively. A solution can then consist in acting on the shape of the navigation within the site itself and in simplifying the searches for keywords and the access to the various links. - For a person with a motor disability problem which can move only parts of his body, a specialised software has to be used. The examples are many as the EXTREME HEADMOUSE (movement of the mouse thanks to the movements of the head) or the EYEGAZE (movement of the mouse thanks to the movements of eyes). Our approach has been to be put in the situation of the disabled person to better evaluate the engendered trouble or lack and look for the most adequate solutions. We leaned for that on the current legislation and on the latest available material and software technologies of information and communication. After the establishment of a catalogue of technical equipments which role is intended to assist the internet website navigation, the objective is the creation of a test website implementing some of the chosen solutions. The evaluation will be made by persons with varied handicaps. The results will be presented at the conference...|$|R
40|$|The White House {{has been}} a symbol of American {{democracy}} since its construction in 1800. It was intended by the builders to be {{a symbol of the}} people's access to and participation in their governance. However, in its 200 year history The People's House has gone from open to all visitors to closed to the general public. The participatory nature of American democracy and the awareness of both early and contemporary citizens of their ability to shape and develop the republic have created a complicated and often tension-filled relationship between the representatives of government and those being governed. That relationship has been exhibited and shaped through the security and visitation policies of the White House, with the level of <b>public</b> <b>access</b> to the <b>building</b> often corresponding to the level of approved public interaction with the government during a given political administration.
