40|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> linear <b>drives</b> {{are widely}} used in manufacturing, mainly for {{handling}} tasks. Due to rising interest in environmental matters and increasing energy costs, energy efficiency {{has become a major}} issue in industrial applications. There is a growing competition between <b>pneumatic</b> and electromechanical <b>drives.</b> <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>drives</b> are said to have a lower efficiency while the initial costs of electromechanical drives are higher.

One should {{deal with the problems}} of long time delay and unmodeled dynamics for active vibration control of a low damping system sometimes. For a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drive</b> flexible manipulator system, time delay or phase lag and unmodeled nonlinear dynamics problems have raised the level of concern. It is vital but difficult to regulate the phase of vibration controller, to compensate for the time-varying phase lag or time delay due to the gas compression and parametric uncertainty of the pneumatic control system. The objective of this investigation is to formulate an active vibration control law with practical approach of phase adjusting for a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drive</b> flexible manipulator system. A control strategy named adaptive phase adjusting control is designed and applied. The adaptive phase adjusting controller is implemented by using the phase angles as explicit parameters. These parameters are tuned online, depending on the corresponding control performance index. To evaluate the control performance of the designed adaptive phase adjusting technique, experiments are conducted on a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drive</b> flexible manipulator experimental setup.

40|$|A kind {{of hybrid}} pneumatic-piezoelectric {{flexible}} manipulator {{system has been}} presented in the paper. A hybrid driving scheme is achieved by combining of a pneumatic proportional valve based <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drive</b> and a piezoelectric actuator bonded to the flexible beam. The system dynamics models are obtained based on system identification approaches, using the established experimental system. For system identification of the flexible piezoelectric manipulator subsystem, parametric estimation methods are utilized. For the pneumatic driven system, a single global linear model is not accurate enough to describe its dynamics, due to the high nonlinearity of the pneumatic driven system. Therefore, a self-organizing map (SOM) based multi-model system identification approach is used to get multiple local linear models. Then, a SOM based multi-model inverse controller and a variable damping pole-placement controller are applied to the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>drive</b> and piezoelectric actuator, respectively. Experiments on pneumatic driven vibration control, piezoelectric vibration control and hybrid vibration control are conducted, utilized proportional and derivative (PD) control, SOM based multi-model inverse controller, and the variable damping pole-placement controller. Experimental results demonstrate that the investigated control algorithms can improve the vibration control performance of the pneumatic driven flexible piezoelectric manipulator system.
