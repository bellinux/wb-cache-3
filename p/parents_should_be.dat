25|$|The {{problem of}} {{pregnancy}} in adolescents is delicate {{and difficult to}} assess using sex education. But Calderone believed otherwise, stating {{that the answer to}} adolescents' sexual woes and pregnancy can not lie primarily in school programmes which at best can only be remedial; what is needed is prevention education and as such <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> involved.|$|E
25|$|This work is chiefly {{remarkable}} {{because in}} some places it seems to recommend parents not to bequeath anything to their children, on the plea {{that it is better}} for the children to suffer want in this world than that their <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> damned in the next (iii. 4). Salvian is very clear on the duty of absolute self-denial in the case of sacred virgins, priests and monks (ii. 8-10).|$|E
25|$|The classic {{diagnostic}} technique is with appropriate X-rays and hip scoring tests. These {{should be done}} at an appropriate age, and perhaps repeated at adulthood - if done too young they will not show anything. Since the condition is {{to a large degree}} inherited, the hip scores of <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> professionally checked before buying a pup, and the hip scores of dogs should be checked before relying upon them for breeding. Despite the fact that the condition is inherited, it can occasionally arise even to animals with impeccably hip scored parents.|$|E

5000|$|Even a {{small change}} in a question's wording can affect how people search through {{available}} information, and hence the conclusions they reach. This was shown using a fictional child custody case. Participants read that Parent A was moderately suitable to be the guardian in multiple ways. Parent B had a mix of salient positive and negative qualities: {{a close relationship with}} the child but a job that would take him or her away for long periods of time. When asked, [...] "Which <b>parent</b> <b>should</b> have custody of the child?" [...] the majority of participants chose Parent B, looking mainly for positive attributes. However, when asked, [...] "Which <b>parent</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> denied custody of the child?" [...] they looked for negative attributes and the majority answered that <b>Parent</b> B <b>should</b> <b>be</b> denied custody, implying that <b>Parent</b> A <b>should</b> have custody.|$|R
25|$|At the Fatal Accident Inquiry held in Banff in February 1972 Adam Watson was {{the chief}} expert witness for the Crown. It emerged that the consent form issued to parents {{did not say that}} winter {{mountaineering}} was involved. Also, only one of the parents had been told the outing was going to be to the Cairngorms. The Inquiry reported that the deaths had been due to cold and exposure. It recommended (1) there should be special regard for fitness and training, (2) <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> given fuller information about outdoor activities, (3) parties should be led by fully qualified instructors and accompanied by certified teachers, (4) suitable locations for summer and winter expeditions should be identified in consultation with mountaineering organisations, (5) experts should advise on whether high-level shelters should be removed, (6) the mountain rescue teams were praised and consideration should be given to supporting the teams financially and generally, (7) following any future disaster there should be closer liaison between authorities and parents. The jury did not want to discourage future adventurous outdoor activities. The advocate for the parents suggested that the overall leader of the expedition and the principal of Lagganlia should be found at fault but the Inquiry did not make any finding of fault.|$|E
500|$|Veterinary geneticists and cardiologists have {{developed}} breeding guidelines to eliminate early-onset mitral valve {{disease in the}} breed, but it is unclear if a statistically significant number of breeders follow these guidelines. The chairperson of the UK CKCS Club said in 2009: [...] "There are many members who are still not prepared to health check their breeding stock, and of those who do, {{it would appear that}} many would not hesitate to breed from affected animals." [...] The MVD breeding protocol recommends that <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> at least 2.5 years old and heart clear, and their parents (i.e., the puppy's grandparents) should be heart clear until age 5.|$|E
500|$|As {{the episode}} opens, Tommy and Angelica Pickles {{and their parents}} are all {{gathering}} to celebrate the Passover Seder {{at the home of}} Didi's parents, Boris and Minka Kropotkin. Stu and Angelica, who are Christians, both find Passover boring, and Angelica argues why she and her <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> at the Seder at all, especially considering Boris and Minka aren't actually related to them. Following an argument with Minka about what type of wine glasses they should use (either the glasses that belonged to Minka's mother or the ones that belonged Boris' father), Boris storms out of the room; the two families arrive and Didi tries comforting her mom, who believes Boris has run away.|$|E

Group members have expressed that even in countries in which English is not the main spoken language, the children will still enjoy themselves. However, the shows for these audiences are adapted to include [...] "more songs, comedy and physical activity". Greene stated the television show is designed to be a joined experience that <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to enjoy along with their children, with the stage shows made to appeal to a whole family audience.

500|$|Some of Alcorn's sympathizers {{publicly}} {{criticized the}} teen's mother, Carla Alcorn, for misgendering {{her daughter in}} the Facebook post announcing the teenager's death. Some individuals—termed [...] "the Internet's self-appointed vigilantes" [...] in The Washington Post—subsequently doxed and harassed Carla via her Facebook account [...] "in revenge" [...] for Leelah's death. On Twitter, American gay rights activist Dan Savage argued that Alcorn's <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> prosecuted for their role in bringing about their daughter's death, commenting that through their actions they [...] "threw {{her in front of}} that truck". He cited the successful prosecution of Dharun Ravi following the suicide of Tyler Clementi as a legal precedent for such an action. He added that legal action should also be brought against the conversion therapists who had counselled Leelah, and suggested that the Alcorns should lose custody of their other children.|$|E

British Labour Party MP Keith Vaz said he was [...] "astonished" [...] by the mission's violence, and Alison Sherratt of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers said that <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> aware of children being exposed to the game because of its realistic graphics and violence. Independent journalist Tom Chick defended the torture sequence, and wrote that unlike the [...] "No Russian" [...] mission or the 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty, the underlying political commentary on torture in [...] "By the Book" [...] necessitated the violent content. Asked about performing the torture sequence, Trevor's actor Steven Ogg said that he treated it like [...] "just another day at the office", and was focused more on not making mistakes during filming than the scene's ethics.

500|$|In {{terms of}} social policy, Bowlby advised that <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{supported}} by society as parents are dependent on a greater society for economic provision and [...] "if a community values its children it must cherish its parents". Also [...] "husbandless" [...] mothers of children under 3 should be supported {{to care for the}} child at home rather than the child be left in inadequate care whilst the mother sought work. (It was assumed the mother of the illegitimate child would usually be left with the child). Fathers left with infants or small children on their hands without the mother should be provided with [...] "housekeepers" [...] so that the children could remain at home. Other proposals included the proper payment of foster homes and careful selection of foster carers, and frank, informative discussions with children about their parents and why they ended up in care and how they felt about it rather than the [...] "least said, soonest mended" [...] approach. The point that children were loyal to and loved even the worst of parents, and needed to have that fact understood non-judgementally, was strongly made.|$|E

The parents were defended by Erich Schmidt-Leichner; their lawyers were {{sponsored}} by the Church. The state recommended that no involved parties be jailed; instead, the recommended sentence for the priests was a fine, while the prosecution concluded that the <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> exempt from punishment as they had [...] "suffered enough", which is a criterion in German penal law, cf. § 60 StGB.|$|E
2500|$|Based {{on these}} arguments, Feyerabend defended {{the idea that}} science should be {{separated}} from the state {{in the same way that}} religion and state are separated in a modern secular society (...)

[...] For example, <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to determine the ideological context of their children's education, instead of having limited options because of scientific standards. According to Feyerabend, science should also be subjected to democratic control: not only should the subjects that are investigated by scientists be determined by popular election, scientific assumptions and conclusions should also be supervised by committees of lay people. He thought that citizens should use their own principles when making decisions about these matters. He rejected the view that science is especially [...] "rational" [...] on the grounds that there is no single common [...] "rational" [...] ingredient that unites all the sciences but excludes other modes of thought (...)

2500|$|Alice {{spoke on}} [...] "Reproduction and Natural Law." [...] She {{asserted}} that childhood health {{should no longer}} {{be seen as a}} result of some ineffable divine design but rather as a logical and predictable result of natural laws governing parental health. She advocated for universal health education to promote a higher standard of health. People looking for a prospective mate should assess their [...] "mental, moral and physical status" [...] and suitability as parents. Prospective parents should educate themselves and follow a healthy lifestyle, insofar as it is possible, so as to produce healthy children. Such a duty was owed both to one's children and to society at large. According to this line of reasoning, the health and education of the mother were essential to the health of her children, and women were therefore encouraged to educate themselves and become physically fit. [...] Moqué explicitly states that those who do not wish to become <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> free not to do so; informed and willing [...] motherhood is hailed as [...] "an intelligent realization of the divine plan of reproduction, a perfect, purposed maternity." ...|$|E
50|$|Child support {{policies}} have been criticized by fathers' rights advocacy groups, {{as well as by}} some feminists, who argue that child support policy violates gender equality and deny reproductive choice to men. States have found no gender discrimination in the child support system, as child support is based upon income and custody arrangements and not on gender. As child support is {{for the benefit of the}} child, not the parent, courts are not sympathetic to the idea that a <b>parent</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to refuse to support a child by claiming that he would have preferred that the child not be born.|$|R

2500|$|Cryptorchidism {{is common}} in male dogs, {{occurring}} {{at a rate of}} up to 10%. [...] Although the genetics are not fully understood, it is thought to be a recessive, and probably polygenetic, trait. [...] Some have speculated that it is a sex-limited autosomal recessive trait; however, it is unlikely to be simple recessive. Dog testes usually descend by ten days of age and it is considered to be cryptorchidism if they do not descend by the age of eight weeks. [...] Cryptorchidism can be either bilateral (causing sterility) or unilateral, and inguinal or abdominal (or both). [...] Because it is an inherited trait, affected dogs should not be bred and should be castrated. [...] The <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> considered carriers of the defect and a breeder should thoughtfully consider whether to breed the carrier parent or not. [...] Littermates may be normal, carriers, or cryptorchid. [...] Castration of the undescended teste(s) should be considered for cryptorchid dogs due to the high rate of testicular cancer, especially sertoli cell tumors. [...] The incidence of testicular cancer is 13.6 times higher in dogs with abdominally retained testicles compared with normal dogs. [...] Testicular torsion is also more likely in retained testicles. [...] Surgical correction is by palpation of the retained testicle and subsequent exploration of the inguinal canal or abdomen, however, it is against AKC rules to show altered dogs, making this correction pointless for breeding stock. Surgical correction is termed orchiopexy, i.e., a surgery to move an undescended testicle into the scrotum and permanently fix it there. Surgical correction is an option for pet dogs that will not be used for breeding.|$|E
2500|$|For many years, {{students}} at the school had formed fraternities and sororities. [...] In {{the wake of a}} student's near death during an initiation in 1907, the citizens of the community began to ask for the secret organizations to be disbanded. [...] In the summer of 1907, school officials formally informed parents of the school's opposition to these groups, and that <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> wary about permitting students to join these groups. [...] As school started in 1908, the school opted to require all students (unless parents were opposed) to sign an oath not to join any secret societies. [...] With the pledges sent out, the secret societies were effectively banned at the school, though not without a fight. [...] The adult sponsor of one fraternity (on whose property the fraternity's house was located) decided to defend the system. [...] It soon became clear that the fight was between representatives of the [...] "old guard" [...] of Oak Park which favored the societies, and newer families who were against them. [...] Even as the last sororities submitted to signing the oath, the fraternities held out hope that they and their parents would prevail. [...] While continued existence of the fraternities was tolerated for a time, by early 1909, the last remaining members were expelled when they failed to comply with the oaths they had signed. [...] After the last fraternity engaged the services of an attorney to defend themselves, the attorney informed the members and their families that the school was within its rights, leading the last holdouts to renounce their membership, and rejoin the school community. [...] Problems with secret societies continued sporadically into 1911, when students were again given the choice of renouncing membership in the groups or face expulsion. [...] Nine students were ultimately expelled. [...] Four of these boys applied to attend one of the public schools in Chicago, and were rejected. [...] One of the nine students was eventually reinstated by a judge, who openly called these secret societies [...] "enemies of the state and foes of our Christian civilization". [...] Expulsions over the offense continued in 1915, though with the added twist of several girls gaining the support of Mrs. Catherine Wright, the wife of architect Frank Lloyd Wright. [...] In 1916, parents supportive of secret societies attempted to get elected to the school board, but failed when the leadership withdrew from the election.|$|E
