40|$|Abstract: South Africa’s cell <b>phone</b> network <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> {{have gained}} a {{reputation}} of providing inadequate levels of service. The study relayed in this article aims to uncover the customers’ level of satisfaction with their cell <b>phone</b> network <b>service</b> <b>providers,</b> and how this satisfaction influences their behavioural intention in the South African context. This will enable cell <b>phone</b> network <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> to {{understand the relationship between}} satisfaction and behavioural intention, which in turn will contribute to developing customer satisfaction and retention strategies, as well as long-term customer loyalty. A total of 500 usable questionnaires were retained for data analysis. The study has uncovered a statistically significant difference between Vodacom and MTN customers with regard to their overall service satisfaction and overall behavioural intention, and this resulted in a partial acceptance of the hypotheses. The results of the study further reveal that customers of different cell <b>phone</b> network <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> feel positive towards their <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> and about doing business with them, but do not believe the interaction is the best outcome that can be achieved. The results also reveal that customers intend to continue using their cell <b>phone</b> network <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> in the future, but are not willing to recommend them to other people. Cell <b>phone</b> network <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> should therefore make adjustments to improve their customer service, quality and strategies to retain customers and increase customer satisfaction...|$|R
