However, most simple DPCM schemes cannot simultaneously cater for smooth signals, noisy signals, and discontinuities such as edges in images. To overcome this, many adaptive DPCM schemes have been proposed, including median predictors, gradient-based switching predictors and gradient-based blending predictors. In this paper we generalize the idea of blending predictors, and describe a powerful technique for creating locally adaptive compound predictors. The result is a prediction scheme which works well over a range of data types froms smooth to noisy, and requires very few tunable parameters. We apply this scheme to greyscale image data, colour image data, and audio data, and compare results {{with some of the}} current best adaptive DPCM predictors. 1 Introduction Image and audio data {{are examples of}} dom [...] ...|$|E

The band-partitioning technique adopted is the Quadrature Mirror Filtering (QMF) method and particular attention is paid to the problems involved with the use of such filters in a sub-band coder. The sub-band signals are quantized using Adaptive <b>Pulse</b> <b>Coded</b> <b>Modulation</b> (APCM) quantizers. The number of quantization levels assigned to the sub-bands is revised regularly to adapt the coder to the changes in time of the spectral properties of speech. A simple algorithm is developed for the optimal (in the mean square error sense) assignment of the bite to the sub-bands based on the relative magnitudes of the sub-band energies. The computer simulation of the coder produces fully intelligible speech of reasonably good quality.

40|$|The {{modified}} Differential <b>Pulse</b> <b>Coded</b> <b>Modulation</b> (DPCM) codec with multi-rate processing {{has been}} shown to able to code source with monotonically decreasing spectrum efficiently at low bit rates [1]. A practical image coder is designed based on this approach. Two dimensional DPCM is used along with decimation and interpolation {{to reduce the number of}} transmitted samples. The decimation rate depends on the signal spectrum and the bit rate. Further bit rate reduction is achieved through adaptive entropy coding. Wiener filter is appended in the decoder for minimizing distortion caused by quantization noise. The decimation filter can be implemented using simple IIR filters. The necessary side information is low. Simulation results show that the coder is able to give good compression performance at low bit rates which is superior to conventional DPCM codec and JPEG. Subjective quality can be as good as JPEG 2000. While at very low bit rates the proposed codec is able to retain certain image characteristics better than JPEG 2000. 1...|$|E

40|$|With the {{advancement}} of computer graphics in the recent years, {{an increasing number of}} pictures, video and 3 D content is generated by synthesis processing rather than acquired with capture devices such as cameras or scanners. Several techniques have been developed for compression of discrete (i. e. piece-wise planar) 3 D models, in the form of 3 D polygonal meshes. However, no important attempt has been made to compress the smooth surfaces of artificially generated 3 D models, that are most often represented as parametric surfaces, of which Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) is a popular form. This paper presents a method for compressing NURBS 3 D models with a small and controllable loss. The scheme uses a differential <b>pulse</b> <b>coded</b> <b>modulation</b> (DPCM) coder with different predictors for knot values and control points, coupled with a uniform scalar quantizer, followed by a bitplane arithmetic entropy coder. The multiplicity of knots is preserved by the use of a multiplicity map. The rate-distortion characteristics of the proposed scheme are evaluated on various models. When compared to MPEG- 4 [8, 9] and Touma-Gotsman [19] compressed triangular meshes, the proposed scheme achieves more than five times better compression, for equivalent L 2 error and much better visual quality.

The image to be coded is first clustered into a small subset of neighboring images and then the neural network-based encoder is used {{to find the best}} matching code sequences in the codebook.

The codebook is analyzed to identify a pattern in the codebook. This pattern is used to train a neural network to obtain the approximate index of the pattern in the codebook. Then, an extensive search is done around this approximate position identified by the neural network to obtain the nearest neighbor of the pattern. Since the candidate set is usually much smaller that the whole code book, there is a substantial saving in codebook search time for coding an image as compared to the traditional method using full codebook search by LBG algorithm...|$|E

The main constraints in a WSN node are limited processing power, memory allocation, and battery life. The goal of this thesis was to develop an image compression algorithm that would thrive under this constraint environment. The main focus was to minimize the complexity of the algorithm by taking advantage of the spatial correlation found in Bayer images. The algorithm employs line based 1 -D Discrete Wavelet Packets Transform of Bayer images. In addition the image compression method includes the application of a third-order Differential <b>Pulse</b> <b>Coded</b> <b>Modulation,</b> and entropy coding. The generation of the prediction values for a third order DPCM were generated based on statistical data of a set of six Kodak true color images.

In addition it was found that applying the JPEG algorithm with a very low quality factor does not preserve the color information in the image. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a compression algorithm using wavelet transform. The principle of wavelet transform is to decompose hierarchically the input image {{into a series}} of successively lower resolution reference images and detail images which contain the information needed to be reconstructed back to the next higher resolution level. The histogram of image sub-bands provides us with information on the distribution of the coefficient values in this sub-image. The sub-band images resulting from wavelet transform are not of equal significance. Some sub-bands contain more information than others. The total number of available bits describing an image is however inevitably limited. Therefore, it is desirable to allocate more bits to those sub-bands images which can be coded more accurately than others. The objective of a such bit allocation method is to optimize the overall coder performance and minimize the quantization error. In determining which wavelet filter is to be used for image compression, some of the properties considered are vanishing moments. The phase non-linearity of the filter can cause severe degradation in the subjective quality of an image. It is related to the symmetry of the filter coefficients. The wavelet transform is implemented using a linear-phase Biorthogonal filter with four levels of decomposition. For this study, we use a scalar quantization with uniform threshold quantizers. The quantization method is PCM (<b>pulse</b> <b>coded</b> <b>modulation)</b> for the coefficients in all high-pass sub-bands. The coefficients of low-pass sub-bands are DPCM (Differential PCM) quantized per region...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Emerging {{technology}} in mobile communications is seeing increasingly high acceptance as a preferred choice for last-mile communication. There {{have been a}} wide range of techniques to achieve signal compression to suit to the smaller bandwidths available on mobile communication channels; but speech recognition methods have seen success mostly only in controlled speech environments. However, designing of speech recognition systems for mobile communications is crucial in order to provide voice enabled command and control and for applications like Mobile Voice Commerce. Continuously Variable Slope Delta (CVSD) modulation, a technique for low bitrate coding of speech, has been in use particularly in military wireless environments for over 30 years, and is now also adopted by BlueTooth. CVSD is particularly suitable for Internet and mobile environments due to its robustness against transmission errors, and simplicity of implementation and the absence of a need for synchronization. In this paper, we study some characteristics of the CVSD speech in the context of robust recognition of compressed speech, and present two methods of improving the recognition accuracy in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. We study the characteristics of the features extracted for ASR and how they relate to the corresponding features computed from <b>Pulse</b> <b>Coded</b> <b>Modulation</b> (PCM) speech and apply this relation to correct the CVSD features to improve recognition accuracy.
