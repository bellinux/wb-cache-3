5000|$|The munin are {{the spirits}} or {{memories}} of the dead <b>pack</b> <b>members,</b> named after Munin, Odin's raven of memory in Norse mythology. Live <b>pack</b> <b>members</b> can [...] "call the munin," [...] drawing on memories or abilities of former <b>members.</b> Various <b>packs</b> appear to preserve the munin by different methods. For example, the werewolves of the Thronos Rokke clan preserve the munin of dead <b>pack</b> <b>members</b> by eating their bodies. Anita has called the munin of Verne's pack. She can also channel the munin of former Lupa of the Thronos Rokke clan, Raina. This is possible because Anita personally killed Raina, and her necromancy powers and ties with the Ulfric of the clan allowed Raina to bind her munin to Anita. Anita can use Raina's munin to heal badly injured lycanthropes, although this requires her {{to be at least}} somewhat sexually attracted to her patient and Raina will usually try to extort a price for the healing, usually something unpleasant or embarrassing to Anita.|$|R
