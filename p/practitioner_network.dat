40|$|Abstract Background Little {{is known}} about the {{practitioners}} in managed behavioral healthcare organization (MBHO) networks who are treating mental and substance use disorders among privately insured patients in the United States. It is likely that the role of the private sector in treating behavioral health will increase due to the recent implementation of federal parity legislation and the inclusion of behavioral health as a required service in the insurance exchange plans created under healthcare reform. Further, the healthcare reform legislation has highlighted the need to ensure a qualified workforce in order to improve access to quality healthcare, and provides an additional focus on the behavioral health workforce. To expand understanding of treatment of mental and substance use disorders among privately insured patients, this study examines practitioner types, experience, specialized expertise, and demographics of in-network practitioners providing outpatient care in one large national MBHO. Methods Descriptive analyses used 2004 practitioner credentialing and other administrative data for one MBHO. The sample included 28, 897 practitioners who submitted at least one outpatient claim in 2004. Chi-square and t-tests were used to compare findings across types of practitioners. Results About half of practitioners were female, 12 % were bilingual, and mean age was 53, with significant variation by practitioner type. On average, practitioners report 15. 3 [*]years of experience (SD[*]=[*] 9. 4), also with significant variation by practitioner type. Many practitioners reported specialized expertise, with about 40 % reporting expertise for treating children and about 60 % for treating adolescents. Conclusions Overall, these results based on self-report indicate that the <b>practitioner</b> <b>network</b> in this large MBHO is experienced and has specialized training, but echo concerns about the aging of this workforce. These data should provide us with a baseline of practitioner characteristics as we enter an era that anticipates great change in the behavioral health workforce. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Varicella (chickenpox) is {{the primary}} disease caused by varicella-zoster virus. It is {{extremely}} contagious and is frequent in children. Indeed, {{in the absence of}} vaccination, a high proportion of the population is liable to contract it. Herpes zoster -more frequent among adults- is caused by reactivation of the latent virus. The objective {{of this study is to}} describe the status of and time trend for varicella and herpes zoster in the Madrid Autonomous Region prior to the introduction of the vaccine to the general population. Methods Data source: individualised varicella and herpes zoster case records kept by the Madrid Autonomous Region Sentinel General <b>Practitioner</b> <b>Network</b> for the period 1997 – 2004. Cumulative incidences, crude and standardised incidence rates, and age-specific rates of varicella and herpes zoster were calculated for each year. Kendall's Tau-b correlation coefficient was calculated to evaluate whether incidence displayed a time trend. Spectral density in the time series of weekly incidences was estimated using a periodogram. Results Standardised annual varicella incidence rates ranged from 742. 5 (95 % CI: 687. 2 – 797. 7) to 1239. 6 (95 % CI: 1164. 5 – 1313. 4) cases per 100 000 person-years. Most cases affected children, though complications were more frequent in adults. Varicella incidence displayed an annual periodicity but no trend over time. Most herpes zoster cases occurred at advanced ages, with incidence registering a rising annual trend but no seasonality factor. Conclusion In the absence of vaccination, no significant changes in varicella incidence were in evidence recent years, though these were observed in the incidence of herpes zoster. Sentinel general practitioner networks are a valid instrument for surveillance of diseases such as varicella. Further varicella vaccination-coverage and vaccine-efficacy studies are called for. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Infectious {{intestinal}} disease (IID) is {{an important}} cause of morbidity in developed countries and a frequent reason for general practitioner (GP) consultation. In recent years polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based techniques have gradually replaced conventional enteropathogen detection techniques like microscopy and culture in primary care patients suspected of IID. PCR features testing of multiple enteropathogens in a single faecal sample with shorter turnaround times and greater sensitivity compared to conventional techniques. However, the associated costs and benefits have not been quantified. Furthermore, primary care incidence and prevalence estimates of enteropathogens associated with IID are sparsely available and predominantly based on conventional techniques. The PROUD-study (PCR diagnostics in Outpatients with Diarrhoea) determines: 1) health (care) effects and 2) cost-effectiveness of PCR introduction in primary care patients suspected of IID; 3) occurrence of major enteropathogens in primary care patients suspected of IID. Methods: A before-after cohort study will be performed of patients with suspected IID consulting a GP in the Utrecht General <b>Practitioner</b> <b>Network</b> (UGPN), covering the before period (2010 - 2011) with conventional testing and the after period (2013 - 2014) with PCR testing. Prospective study data on patient characteristics and primary outcome measures (i. e. healthcare use and disease outcome) will be collected from electronic patient and laboratory records in 2015 and 2016. The effect of PCR introduction is investigated by comparing the primary outcome measures and their associated healthcare costs between the conventional period and the PCR period, and {{is followed by a}} cost-effectiveness analysis. To determine the occurrence of enteropathogens associated with IID in primary care, routine care faeces samples from the year 2014 will be screened using PCR. Discussion: The PROUD-study will quantify the costs and effects of the introduction of PCR techniques for enteropathogens in primary care patients suspected of IID and generate up-to-date and sensitive estimates of enteropathogen occurrence among primary care patients...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background During the 2009 {{influenza}} A/H 1 N 1 pandemic, adjuvanted {{influenza vaccines}} {{were used for}} the first time on a large scale. Results on the effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing 2009 influenza A/H 1 N 1 -related hospitalisation are scanty and varying. Methods We conducted a matched case-control study in individuals with an indication for vaccination due to underlying medical conditions and/or age ≥ 60 years in the Netherlands. Cases were patients hospitalised with laboratory-confirmed 2009 A/H 1 N 1 influenza infection between November 16, 2009 and January 15, 2010. Controls were matched to cases on age, sex and type of underlying medical condition(s) and drawn from an extensive general <b>practitioner</b> <b>network.</b> Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the vaccine effectiveness (VE = 1 - OR). Different sensitivity analyses were used to assess confounding by severity of underlying medical condition(s) and the effect of different assumptions for missing dates of vaccination. Results 149 cases and 28, 238 matched controls were included. It was estimated that 22 % of the cases and 28 % of the controls received vaccination more than 7 days before the date of onset of symptoms in cases. A significant number of breakthrough infections were observed. The VE was estimated at 19 % (95 %CI - 28 - 49). After restricting the analysis to cases with controls suffering from severe underlying medical conditions, the VE was 49 % (95 %CI 16 - 69). Conclusions The number of breakthrough infections, resulting in modest VE estimates, suggests that the MF- 59 ™ adjuvanted vaccine may have had only a limited impact on preventing 2009 influenza A/H 1 N 1 -related hospitalisation in this setting. As the main aim of influenza vaccination programmes is to reduce severe influenza-related morbidity and mortality from influenza in persons at high risk of complications, a more effective vaccine, or additional preventive measures, are needed. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{epidemic}} in the influenza season 2001 / 2002 was of moderate activity {{just like in}} 2000 / 2001. The influenza epidemic started in week 2 of 2002 when the clinical influenza activity reported by the general <b>practitioner</b> <b>network</b> of the Netherlands Institute of Primary Health Care (NIVEL) increased. This was caused by influenza A viruses of the H 3 N 2 subtype in particular. All influenza A viruses of this type were {{closely related to the}} vaccine strain for this subtype, A/Moscow/ 1 / 99. Influenza B viruses and influenza A/H 1 viruses isolated this season had surprising features. The influenza B viruses originated from two lineages. Viruses of the B/Yamagata/ 16 / 88 lineage have been circulating for more than twelve years. The vaccine reference strain B/Sichuan/ 379 / 99 belongs to this lineage. The B/Victoria/ 2 / 87 lineage reappeared again after an absence in Europe of more than ten years and accounted for 50 % of the influenza B viruses that were isolated in the Netherlands. Therefore the vaccine will have provided only partial protection against influenza B. The only influenza A/H 1 virus that was isolated appeared to be of a new subtype H 1 N 2. The H 1 hemagglutinin of this virus was closely related to that of the vaccine strain A/New Caledonia/ 20 / 99. The N 2 neuraminidase originated from recent human influenza A/H 3 N 2 viruses. Therefore the vaccine probably provided good protection against the new H 1 N 2 subtype. Based in part on these data, the World Health Organization has advised that the vaccines for the season 2202 / 2003 should contain the following or comparable influenza-virus strains: A/Moscow/ 10 / 99 (H 3 N 2), A/New Caledonia/ 20 / 99 (H 1 N 1) and B/Hong Kong/ 330 / 01, the latter being an influenza B virus of the B/Victoria/ 2 / 87 lineage...|$|E
40|$|The Central Queensland Mine Rehabilitation Group (CQMRG) {{has hosted}} mine site {{rehabilitation}} inspections combined with technical workshops {{for more than}} 20 years. It was recognised at CQMRG's anniversary meeting in April 2013 that the vast body of knowledge held by rehabilitation and closure planning practitioners was being lost as senior rehabilitation experts retire from the industry. It was noted that even more knowledge could be readily lost unless a knowledge management platform was developed to capture, store and enable retrieval of this information. This loss of knowledge results in a significant cost to industry. This project was therefore undertaken to review tools which {{have the capability to}} gather the less formal knowledge as well as to make links to existing resources and bibliographic material. This scoping study evaluated eight alternative knowledge management systems to provide guidance on the best method of providing the industry with an up-to-date, good practice, knowledge management system for rehabilitation and closure practices, with capability for information sharing via a portal and discussion forum. This project provides guidance for a larger project which will implement the knowledge management system to meet the requirements of the CQMRG and be transferrable to other regions if applicable. It will also provide the opportunity to identify missing links between existing tools and their application. That is, users may not be aware of how these existing tools can be used to assist with mine rehabilitation planning and implementation {{and the development of a}} new platform will help to create those linkages. The outcomes of this project are directed toward providing access to a live repository of rehabilitation practice information which is Central Queensland coal mine-specific, namely: highlighting best practice activities, results of trials and innovative practices; updated legislative requirements; links to practices elsewhere; and informal anecdotal information relevant to particular sites which may be of assistance in the development of rehabilitation of new areas. Solutions to the rehabilitation of challenging spoils/soils will also be provided. The project will also develop a process which can be applied more broadly within the mining sector to other regions and other commodities. Providing a platform for uploading information and holding discussion forums which can be managed by a regional <b>practitioner</b> <b>network</b> enables the new system to be kept alive, driven by users and information needs as they evolve over time. Similar internet-based platforms exist and are managed successfully. The preferred knowledge management system will capture the less formal and more difficult to access knowledge from rehabilitation and mine closure practitioners and stakeholders through the CQMRG and other contributors. It will also provide direct links, and greater accessibility, to more formal sources of knowledge with anticipated cost savings to the industry and improved rehabilitation practices with successful transitioning to closure and post-mining land use...|$|E

The expansion {{of these approaches}} is particularly apparent in the Pacific, where communities rely heavily on small-scale fisheries (Govan 2009 a) and concerns about sustainability are increasing (Bell et al. 2009; Brewer et al. 2009).

There are also likely to be hundreds to thousands of communities implementing management, outside the formal network, which do not appear on any official list (Govan 2009 a). For simplicity, we use the term LMMA broadly to encompass local management that: 1) is applied to nearshore marine areas; 2) seeks to meet local management objectives; 3) employs locally negotiated rules that integrate customary or local governance institutions; 4) is adaptable via learning-by-doing approaches; and 5) includes circumstances where resident communities may be collaborating with partners such as non-government organisations, government agencies or research institutes (Govan 2009 a).
