5|$|Intimidator 305 {{features}} two trains themed as Dale Earnhardt's black number 3 car. The trains feature headlights at {{the front}} of each train as well as advertisement stickers that are found on NASCAR cars. One train is red with the other being silver. Each train has eight four-passenger cars, allowing thirty-two passengers per train. The trains are arranged in stadium-style seating with overhead lap bars fitted with soft, <b>padded</b> over-the-shoulder straps. In early July 2010, the ride received a unique new restraint design. The over-the-shoulder part of the harness now resembles a <b>padded</b> seat belt rather than the typical over-the-shoulder restraints used by Intamin.|$|E

5|$|The lower seating bowl {{is divided}} into 24 {{sections}} and wraps around the playing field from one foul pole to the other. The second level has 16sections of seating that begin behind third base and wrap around to first base. The last nine rows, from row M, on the first level between the dugouts are sheltered by the upper deck. Seats on both levels are traditional, plastic stadium-style chairs. All lower-level seats behind home plate, seats behind and between the dugouts through row P, and all second-level seats have <b>padded</b> seat cushions. Seats in the three center upper-deck sections behind home plate and all second-level suites also have <b>padded</b> seat backs. A grass berm that can accommodate 1,500spectators is located beyond the left-center field wall.|$|E
40|$|Fundamental {{investigation}} for <b>pad</b> conditioning was studied on CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing). In particular, <b>pad</b> surface roughness {{was focused on}} various <b>pad</b> surface conditions. <b>Pad</b> conditioning under wet condition makes <b>pad</b> surface roughness finer than <b>pad</b> conditioning under dry condition. The <b>pad</b> surface with fine roughness contributes to rapid <b>pad</b> break-in and removal rate　stabilization. In this study, various factors of <b>pad</b> conditioning were verified to clarify the difference of <b>pad</b> conditioning between under wet condition and dry condition. One of major differences of <b>pad</b> conditioning under dry condition against wet condition was the magnitude of friction force between <b>pad</b> and conditioner, which generates stick-slip motion of <b>pad</b> conditioner on a <b>pad.</b> The other was removal efficiency of <b>pad</b> fragment to be scraped away on conditioning <b>pad.</b> <b>Pad</b> fragments disturbs a stable contact between <b>pad</b> and conditioner. Consequently, {{it will be possible}} to realize <b>pad</b> pre-conditioning without pasting <b>pad</b> on a platen by taking appropriate measures against the two...|$|R

30|$|A general {{description}} {{of all the}} remaining mode shapes of draft gear is also necessary to establish {{the correlation between the}} mode shapes of draft <b>pad</b> and draft gear. For the second mode of the draft gear, linear displacement of the interface between <b>pad</b> 3 and <b>pad</b> 4 in lateral (z) direction is observed causing the draft <b>pads</b> to exhibit modal behaviour close to its second mode shape. The third mode shows linear displacement of the interface between <b>pad</b> 3 and <b>pad</b> 4 in vertical (y) direction causing the draft <b>pads</b> to exhibit modal behaviour close to its third mode shape. For the fourth mode shape, the interface between <b>pad</b> 3 and <b>pad</b> 4 remains fixed and the interfaces between <b>pads</b> 1 and 2, 2 and 3 and interfaces between <b>pads</b> 4 and 5, 5 and 6 oscillate about longitudinal (x) axis in opposite sense. As a result, modal behaviour corresponding to the first mode shape of draft <b>pad</b> is observed in some draft <b>pads.</b> Fifth mode shape shows oscillation of the interface between <b>pad</b> 3 and <b>pad</b> 4 about vertical (y) axis. The results is that some draft <b>pads</b> exhibit second modal behaviour while some exhibit fourth modal behaviour of individual draft <b>pad.</b>|$|R

40|$|Autoantibodies {{directed}} against citrullinated epitopes of proteins are highly diagnostic of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and {{elevated levels of}} protein citrullination {{can be found in}} the joints of patients with RA. Calcium-dependent peptidyl-arginine deiminases (<b>PAD)</b> are the enzymes responsible for citrullination. <b>PAD</b> 2 and <b>PAD</b> 4 are enriched in neutrophils and likely drive citrullination under inflammatory conditions. <b>PADs</b> may be released during NETosis or cell death, but the mechanisms responsible for <b>PAD</b> activity under physiological conditions have not been fully elucidated. To understand how <b>PADs</b> citrullinate extracellular proteins, we investigated the cellular localization and activity of <b>PAD</b> 2 and <b>PAD</b> 4, and we report that viable neutrophils from healthy donors have active <b>PAD</b> 4 exposed on their surface and spontaneously secrete <b>PAD</b> 2. Neutrophil activation by some stimulatory agents increased the levels of immunoreactive <b>PAD</b> 4 on the cell surface, and some stimuli reduced <b>PAD</b> 2 secretion. Our data indicate that live neutrophils have the inherent capacity to express active extracellular <b>PADs.</b> These novel pathways are distinguished from intracellular <b>PAD</b> activation during NETosis and calcium influx-mediated hypercitrullination. Our study implies that extracellular <b>PADs</b> may have a physiological role under non-pathogenic conditions as well as a pathological role in RA...|$|R
30|$|Sixth {{mode shape}} shows {{oscillation}} of {{the interface between}} <b>pad</b> 3 and <b>pad</b> 4 about lateral (z) axis. As a result some draft <b>pads</b> exhibit third modal behaviour of individual draft <b>pad.</b> In the seventh mode shape, interfaces between <b>pads</b> 2 and 3, 4 and 5 remains fixed and interfaces between <b>pads</b> 1 and 2, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6 oscillate about longitudinal (x) axis causing every single <b>pad</b> to execute motion in accordance to first mode shape. The eight mode shape of draft gear is oscillation of all draft <b>pad</b> interfaces about lateral (z) axis. This oscillation results in fifth mode shape for all <b>pads.</b> For the ninth mode shape of draft gear, the interface between <b>pads</b> 3 and 4 remains fixed while the adjacent interfaces (i.e. interface between <b>pads</b> 1 and 2, 2 and 3 and interfaces between <b>pads</b> 4 and 5, 5 and 6) oscillate in opposite direction. This mode thus causes all <b>pads</b> to behave in accordance to first mode shape. For the tenth mode shape of draft gear, interface between <b>pads</b> 2 and 3 and <b>pads</b> 4 and 5 oscillate between about vertical (y) axis in opposite phase. The resulting effect is that all <b>pads</b> execute second modal behaviour.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a finite}} element sub-modelling method {{is used to}} {{estimate}} the stress distribution and the crack propagation lifetime in Aluminium alloy, Al 7075 -T 6 specimens. Different contact geometries, i. e. cylinder-on-flat and flat-on-flat, and different contact span width's with different <b>pad's</b> compression forces are analysed. It is found that fretting fatigue life for two based cylindrical <b>pads</b> is shorter than that for two based flat <b>pads</b> and in two based flat <b>pads</b> is shorter than that for perfectly flat <b>pads.</b> In the case of two based flat <b>pads,</b> stress distribution in the <b>pad</b> with width of 3. 1 mm is about 14 % higher than that in the <b>pad</b> with the width of 6. 2 mm and about 21 % higher than that in the <b>pad</b> with the width of 9. 3 mm.

5|$|The {{attack was}} led by Hernando Pizarro, the senior Spanish {{commander}} in Cusco, with a force of 100Spaniards (30infantry, 70cavalry) and an estimated 30,000 native allies. One of his main assets against the Inca armies was the Spanish cavalry because horses provided a considerable advantage in hitting power, maneuverability, speed, and stamina over Inca warriors. All Spaniards wore some kind of armor, {{the most commonly used}} types were chain mail shirts and <b>padded</b> cloth armor which were lighter and cheaper than full armor suits; they were complemented by steel helmets and small iron or wooden shields. The main Spanish offensive weapon was the steel sword, which horsemen supplemented with the lance; both weapons could easily penetrate the <b>padded</b> armor worn by Inca troops. Firearms, such as arquebuses were rarely used during the Spanish conquest of Peru because they were scarce, hard to use, and despised by horsemen as an ungentlemanly weapon. Spaniards relied heavily on Indian auxiliaries because they provided thousands of warriors as well as support personnel and supplies. These native troops had the same sorts of arms and armor as their Inca counterparts. During the Ollantaytambo campaign, the Pizarro expedition included thousands of auxiliaries, mainly Cañaris, Chachapoyas, and Wankas as well as several members of the Inca nobility opposed to Manco Inca.|$|E
