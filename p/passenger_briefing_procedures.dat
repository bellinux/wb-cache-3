There is no standard policy in effect for advising a defendant of his legal rights prior to evaluation by a mental health professional for purposes of a pre-sentence report. The {{aim of this study}} was to gain a better understanding of the effects that different types of briefing or warning statements may have upon clients in a court clinic. The present study systematically investigated two factors in briefings given before a pre-sentence evaluation. The first factor was the nonverbal communication of the person giving the briefing. The effects of these briefing manipulations were assessed in terms of client behavior and mental health evaluator's impression of the client. Specifically, these dependent variables were measured by MMPI scales L, K, and Pd, an Evaluation Rating Scale, a Briefing Questionnaire, a Psychopathology Rating Scale and a Nonverbal Behavior Record Form. A set of hypotheses was forwarded which predicted that these behavioral indices would vary as a result of changes in <b>briefing</b> <b>procedure.</b> Contrary to predictions, results indicated that the <b>briefing</b> <b>procedures</b> had no significant effect upon any of the measures of clients' behavior. While questionnaire data indicated that subjects were affected by the type of briefing immediately after the briefing was given, it appears that these effects were of very short duration.

30|$|Antibodies were {{attached}} {{to the surface of}} QDs by chemical crosslinking to obtain QD-antibody conjugates. The <b>brief</b> <b>procedures</b> are as follows: 60  pmol of QDs, 10  μg of EDC, 15  μg of NHS solution, and 20  μg of CRP 135 mAb solution are added into PBS. And then, the solution is mixed evenly; the mixed solution is shaken gently for 24  h at room temperature; after that, 1  mg of glycine for blocking is added in the solution. The mixture is further separated and purified by using an ultra-filtration membrane (Microcon YM 30, Millipore) to obtain QD-CRP 135 mAb conjugates. Finally, the purified QD-CRP 135 mAb conjugates is dissolved in PBS and stored at 4  °C for further use. QD- 14 C 12 mAb conjugates can be obtained by the same way. The fluorescence emission spectra and quantum yields of QD-antibody conjugates and hydrophobic CdSe/ZnS QDs were acquired with the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 2450, Shimadzu) and the fluorescence spectrometer (Ls 55, PerkinElmer).|$|R

Parameters that were assessed included intraoperative patient movement, surgeon satisfaction, anaesthesia time, total ketamine dose, postoperative recovery time, agitation and side-effects. Intraoperative patient movement scores were significantly lower, and surgeon satisfaction scores were significantly higher, in the KR group than in the K group.

40|$|Background. Although remifentanil's short-acting {{pharmacokinetic}} pro®le {{makes it}} {{well suited for}} procedures during which {{a brief period of}} intense analgesia is required, setting up an infusion pump for <b>brief</b> <b>procedures</b> is inconvenient. The clinical pharmacology of remifentanil administered by bolus injection, a more convenient alternative, has not been explored in detail. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} examine the safety of single bolus doses of remifentanil in conscious, healthy, adult volunteers breathing room air. Secondary aims included the evaluation of remifentanil pharmacokinetics and analgesic effects after bolus injection and a comparison of these issues in younger vs older adults. Methods. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, crossover study design, 64 subjects (16 over 60 years old) received remifentanil or placebo by bolus injection in a ®xed unit dose separated by a 1 h washout period.
