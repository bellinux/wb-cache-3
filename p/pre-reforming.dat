50|$|In {{a popular}} {{publication}} quoted below occurs the following notice of a well-known land mollusk, {{in connection with}} a traditionary story of the plague, which has long had general currency in Scotland: ‘In the woodlands, the more formidable black nude slug, the Arion or Limax, will also be often encountered. It is a huge voracious creature, herbivorous, feeding, to Barbara’s astonishment, on tender plants; fruits, as strawberries, apples; and even turnips and mushrooms; appearing morning and evening, or after rain; suffering severely in its concealment in long droughts, and remaining torpid in winter. The gray field slug (Limax agrestis) is actually recommended to be swallowed by consumptive patients! In the town of Dundee there exists a strange traditionary story of the plague, connected with the conversion, from dire necessity of the Arion ater, or black slug, to a use similar to that which the luxurious Romans are said to have made of the great apple-snail. Two young and blooming maidens lived together at that dread time, like Bessie Bell and Mary Gray, in a remote cottage on the steep (indeed almost perpendicular) ascent of the Bonnetmaker’s Hill. Deprived of friends or support by the pestilence that walked at noonday, they still retained their good looks and healthful aspect, even when the famine had succeeded to the plague. The jaundiced eyes of the famine-wasted wretches around them were instantly turned towards the poor girls, who appeared to thrive so well whilst others were famishing. They were unhesitatingly accused of witchcraft, and had nearly fallen a prey to that terrible charge; for betwixt themselves they had sworn never to tell in words by what means they were supported, ashamed as they felt of the resource to which they had been driven; and resolved, if possible, to escape the anticipated derision of their neighbours on its disclosure. It was only when about to be dragged before their stern inquisitors, that one of the girls, drawing aside the covering of a great barrel which stood in a corner of their domicile, discovered, without violating her oath, that the youthful pair had been driven to the desperate necessity of collecting and preserving for food large quantities of these Limacinae, which they ultimately acknowledged to have proved to them generous and even agreeable sustenance. To the credit of the times of George Wishart—a glimpse of <b>pre-reforming</b> enlightenment—the explanation sufficed; the young women escaped with their lives, and were even applauded for their prudence.|$|E
40|$|Several {{measures}} concerning fuel processing in a solid {{oxide fuel}} cell (SOFC) system offer {{the possibility of}} significant cost reduction and higher system efficiencies. For SOFC systems, the ratio between internal and <b>pre-reforming</b> has to be optimized {{on the basis of}} experimental performance data. Furthermore, anode gas recycling by an injector in front of the pre-reformer can eliminate the steam generator and the corresponding heat of evaporation. A detailed study is carried out on <b>pre-reforming</b> in a reformer of considerable size (10 kW(el)). Simulating anode gas recycling with an injector, the influence of carbon dioxide on reactor performance was studied. Also, the dependence of the methanol conversion on mass flow and temperature will be discussed. In addition, some results concerning the dynamic behaviour of the pre-reformer are given.

40|$|Fuel cell {{performance}} depends strongly on the anode microstructure, which {{is determined by}} the anode compositions and fabrication conditions. Four types of anodes with two kinds of NiO and GDC powders were investigated. By carefully adjusting the anode microstructure, the GDC electrolyte/anode interfacial polarization resistances reduced dramatically. The interfacial resistance at 600 C decreased from 1. 61 {Omega} cm{sup 2 } for the anodes prepared using commercially available powders to 0. 06 {Omega} cm{sup 2 } for those prepared using powders derived from a glycine-nitrate process. The critical issues facing the development of economically competitive SOFC systems include lowering the operation temperature and creating novel anode materials and microstructures capable of efficiently utilizing hydrocarbon fuels. Anode-supported SOFCs with an electrolyte of 20 {micro}m- thick Gd-doped ceria (GDC) were fabricated by co-pressing, and both Ni- and Cu-based anodes were prepared by a solution impregnation process. At 600 C, SOFCs fueled with humidified H{sub 2 }, methane, and propane, reached peak power densities of 602, 519, and 433 mW/cm{sup 2 }, respectively. Both microstructure and composition of the anodes, as fabricated using a solution impregnation technique, greatly influence fuel {{cell performance}}. Although steam reforming or partial oxidation is effective in avoiding carbon deposition of hydrocarbon fuels, it increases the operating cost and reduces the energy efficiency. A catalyst (1 %wt Pt dispersed on porous Gd-doped ceria) for <b>pre-reforming</b> of propane was developed with relatively low steam to carbon (S/C) ratio ({approx} 0. 5), coupled with direct utilization of the reformate in low-temperature SOFCs. Propane was converted to smaller molecules during <b>pre-reforming,</b> including H{sub 2 }, CH{sub 4 }, CO, and CO{sub 2 }. A peak power density of 247 mW/cm{sup 2 } was observed when pre-reformed propane was directly fed to an SOFC operated at 600 C.

40|$|Fuel {{cells are}} more and more used in hybrid systems with micro-turbines for {{electricity}} and heat delivery. Two types of fuel cells are mostly used for cogeneration: solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC). Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are operating at high temperatures that make them well suited for cogeneration process, but influence the entire system due to their dynamic character. The hybrid system requires a <b>pre-reforming</b> process in order to convert the fuels, such as natural gas, in a gas with a high hydrogen content for the electrochemically oxidation with air. In this paper the dynamic model of the SOFC and of the hybrid system is developed in Matlab-Simulink environment.

40|$|Internal {{reforming}} is {{an attractive}} option offering a significant cost reduction, higher efficiencies and faster load response of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) power plant. However, complete internal reforming may lead to several problems which can be avoided with partial <b>pre-reforming</b> of natural gas. In order to achieve high total plant efficiency associated with low energy consumption and low investment costs, a process concept has been developed based on all {{the components of the}} SOFC system. In the case of anode gas recycling an internal steam circuit exists. This has the advantage that {{there is no need for}} an external steam generator and the steam concentration in the anode gas is reduced. However, anode gas recycling has to be proven by experiments in a pre-reformer and for internal reforming. The addition of carbon dioxide clearly shows a decrease in catalyst activity, while for temperatures higher than 1000 K hydrogen leads to an increase of the measured methane conversion rates.

40|$|The {{deactivation}} {{pattern of}} a “model” Ni/MgO catalyst in the <b>pre-reforming</b> of n-hexane with steam (T, 450 °C; P, 5 – 15 bar) is reviewed. The {{influence of the}} steam-to-carbon ratio (S/C, 1. 5 – 3. 5) on the rate of catalyst fouling by coking is ascertained. Catalyst fouling leads to an exponential decay in activity, denoting 1 st-order dependence of the coking process on active sites availability. Hydrogen hinders the coking process, though slight activity decay is due to sintering of the active Ni phase. Deactivation by thiophene causes a sharp, almost linear, drop to nearly zero activity within only 6 h; this deactivation is likely due to dissociative adsorption of thiophene with subsequent strong, irreversible chemical adsorption of S-atoms on active Ni sites, i. e., irreversible poisoning. Modeling of activity decay curves (α, at/a 0) by proper kinetic equations allows assessing the effects of temperature, pressure, S/C, H 2 and thiophene feed on the deactivation pattern of the model Ni/MgO catalyst by coking, sintering, and poisoning phenomena...|$|E

The performance of the centrifugal compressors and radial turbine is determined using maps, properly scaled in order to match the values required for mass flow rate and pressure ratio. Compact heat exchangers are simulated using Colburn and friction factor correlations. For the SOFC, the cell voltage versus current density curves (i. e. polarization curves) are generated on the basis of the Nernst potential and overvoltages. Validation of the SOFC polarization curves is accomplished with data available from Siemens Westinghouse. Both the steam–methane <b>pre-reforming</b> and internal reforming processes are modeled assuming the water–gas shift reaction to be equilibrium-controlled and the demethanization reactions to be kinetically controlled.

40|$|Among {{the various}} {{configurations}} of fossil fuel power plants with carbon capture, this paper focuses on pre-combustion techniques applied to natural gas combined cycles. With more detail, the plant configuration here addressed includes: (i) the steam reforming of natural gas, {{based on an}} air-blown autothermal process, following a recuperative <b>pre-reforming</b> treatment, (ii) the water gas shift producing CO 2 and H 2, (iii) the separation of CO 2 {{by means of a}} mixed physical–chemical absorption system using a MDEA solution, and (iv) a hydrogen fuelled combined cycle.

This paper proposes a detailed thermodynamic study and optimization of the plant configuration, bringing to a reliable performance estimation based on today’s best available technology as far as the various plant sections are concerned (gas and steam turbine, natural gas reforming process, CO 2 separation). The predicted LHV efficiency for the base configuration is about 50 %.

The observed power densities of 231, 332, and 443 mWcm- 2 at 500, 525 and 550 C, respectively, {{make it possible to}} operate SOFCs at temperatures about 500 C. Fuel cell performance depends strongly on the anode microstructure, which is determined by the anode compositions and fabrication conditions. Four types of anodes with two kinds of NiO and GDC powders were investigated. By carefully adjusting the anode microstructure, the GDC electrolyte/anode interfacial polarization resistances reduced dramatically. The interfacial resistance at 600 C decreased from 1. 61 {omega} cm{sup 2 } for the anodes prepared using commercially available powders to 0. 06 {omega} cm{sup 2 } for those prepared using powders derived from a glycine-nitrate process.

Propane was converted to smaller molecules during <b>pre-reforming,</b> including H{sub 2 }, CH{sub 4 }, CO, and CO{sub 2 }. A peak power density of 247 mW/cm{sup 2 } was observed when pre-reformed propane was directly fed to an SOFC operated at 600 C. No carbon deposition was observed in the fuel cell for a continuous operation of 10 hours at 600 C. The ability of producing vastly different microstructures and morphologies of the very same material is critical to the fabrication of functionally graded electrodes for solid-state electrochemical devices such as SOFCs and lithium batteries. By carefully adjusting deposition parameters, we have successfully produced oxide nano-powders with the size of 30 {approx} 200 nm. Porous films with various microstructures and morphologies are also deposited on several substrates by systematic adjustment of the deposition parameters. Highly porous, excellently bonded and nano-structured electrodes fabricated by combustion CVD exhibit extremely high surface area and remarkable catalytic activities. Using in situ potential dependent FTIR emission spectroscopy, we have found evidence for two, possibly three distinct di-oxygen species present on the electrode surface. We have successfully identified which surface oxygen species is present under a particular electrical or chemical condition and have been able to deduce the reaction mechanisms. This technique will be used to probe the gas-solid interactions at or near the TPB and on the surfaces of mixed-conducting electrodes in an effort to understand the molecular processes relevant to the intrinsic catalytic activity.

40|$|Steam Methane Reformer is the commonest {{process for}} {{producing}} hydrogen in the world. It currently represents {{the most efficient}} and mature technology for this purpose. However, due to the high investment costs, this technology is convenient for large sizes only. Furthermore, the cooling of syngas and flue gas produce {{a great amount of}} excess steam, which is usually transferred outside the process, for heating purposes or industrial applications. The opportunity of using this additional steam to generate electric power has been studied in this paper. In particular different power plant schemes have been analyzed, including: (i) a Rankine cycle; (ii) a gas turbine simple cycle; (iii) a gas-steam combined cycle. These configurations have been investigated with the additional feature of CO 2 capture and sequestration.

40|$|Aim of {{the work}} is the {{implementation}} of a low temperature reforming (LT reforming) unit downstream the Haloclean pyrolyser in order to enhance the heating value of the pyrolysis gas. Outside the focus of this work was to gain a synthesis gas quality for further use. Temperatures between 400 °C and 500 °C were applied. A commercial <b>pre-reforming</b> catalyst on a nickel basis from Südchemie was chosen for LT reforming. As biogenic feedstock wheat straw has been used. Pyrolysis of wheat straw at 450 °C by means of Haloclean pyrolysis leads to 28 % of char, 50 % of condensate and 22 % of gas. The condensate separates in a water phase and an organic phase. The organic phase is liquid, but contains viscous compounds. These compounds could underlay aging and could lead to solid tars which can cause post processing problems. Therefore, the implementation of a catalytic reformer is not only of interest from an energetic point of view, it is generally interesting for tar conversion purposes after pyrolysis applications. By using a fixed bed reforming unit at 450 – 490 °C and space velocities about 3000 l/h the pyrolysis gas volume flow could be increased to about 58 %. This corresponds to a decrease of the yields of condensates by means of catalysis up to 17 %, the yield of char remains unchanged, since pyrolysis conditions are the same. The heating value in the pyrolysis gas could be increased by the factor of 1. 64. Hydrogen concentrations up to 14 % could be realised...|$|E
40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) deliver an {{energy-efficient}} and eco-friendly pathway to convert biogas into syngas and electricity. However, many problems {{still need to}} be solved before their commercialization. Some of the disadvantages of biogas SOFC technology include coking and sulfur poisoning that lead to catalyst deactivation and large thermal gradients causing thermal stress. In this work, a novel on-cell micro-reformer and NiSn bimetallic nanoparticles were introduced into a conventional Ni-based anode for efficient and durable internal reforming of biogas. The add-on micro-reformer, consisting of tailored Ni foam supported NiSn/Al 2 O 3 nanoclusters, exhibited excellent reforming activity and outstanding resistance to coking and sulfur poisoning. Thus, the <b>pre-reforming</b> process in the micro-reformer could effectively decrease the thermal gradients in the anode. Besides, the loosely filled nanoclusters showed high capability of releasing thermal stress due to their movable nature. Moreover, the yielded syngas was partially electro-oxidized in a coke/sulfur tolerant NiSn bimetallic anode to compensate the energy consumption and promote the conversion of biogas. At 850 °C and in a CH 4 –CO 2 - 200 ppm H 2 S atmosphere, a peak power density as high as 0. 946 W cm− 2 was achieved. With a constant current density of 1. 25 A cm− 2, the CH 4 conversion and CO selectivity remained at around 95 % while processing a steady output voltage (0. 69 V), demonstrating excellent activity and coke/sulfur tolerance that have rarely been reported.
