50|$|Certain modern {{vehicles}} have {{height adjustable}} suspension {{in order to}} improve aerodynamics and fuel efficiency. Modern formula cars that have exposed wheels and suspension typically use streamlined tubing rather than simple round tubing for their suspension arms to reduce aerodynamic drag. Also typical is the use of rocker arm, <b>push</b> <b>rod,</b> or <b>pull</b> <b>rod</b> type suspensions that, among other things, place the spring/damper unit inboard and out of the air stream to further reduce air resistance.|$|R
40|$|In the racecar {{design process}} the {{definition}} of suspension type and geometry is an important stage. A good design of the main parameters, in terms of static and dynamic angles in bump and steer, {{is the basis of}} a successful racecar quite often. This paper aims at introducing {{the development of a new}} software tool, called MLKrace, that can analyse the suspensions kinematics for a wide range of different layouts. There are today a lot of commercial tools that analyse or simulate suspension behaviour. In general their application is restricted to the classic double wishbone suspension and in this case the calculation of the kinematics is not so difficult. This layout is used on both ends of the majority of formula and sports race cars but it isn’t the only possible one. The MLKrace software is instead more suitable to analyse innovative suspension geometries, the mathematics being based on the resolution of the so-called Stewart platform, a method originally devised for parallel robot kinematics. Therefore full multilink or hybrid systems can be designed as easily as a double wishbone. In addition <b>push</b> <b>rod,</b> <b>pull</b> <b>rod</b> or outboard spring systems can be added and the driveshaft required float is computed. Multilink-McPherson hybrid suspensions can be designed as well. The flexibility is the great advantage of this new software. Apart from the mathematic model, a massive effort was devoted to the design of the Windows interface with the aim of making the designer’s job particularly easy and effective compared to outdated MS-Dos interfaces of most of the existing software. The output is shown in the form of 2 D and 3 D animations, a large number of predefined diagrams, numeric tables and regression functions...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a new input device that allows users to intuitively specify three-dimensional coordinates in graphics applications. The device consists of a cubeshaped box with three perpendicular rods passing through the center and buttons on the top for additional control. The rods represent the X, Y, and Z axes of a given coordinate system. <b>Pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> the <b>rods</b> specifies constrained motion along the corresponding axes. Embedded within the device is a six degree of freedom tracking sensor, which allows the rods to be continually aligned with a coordinate system located in a virtual world. We have integrated the device into two visualization prototypes for crash engineers and geologists from oil and gas companies. In these systems the Cubic Mouse controls the position and orientation of a virtual model and the rods move three orthogonal cutting or slicing planes through the model.

40|$|Abstract. The {{horizontal}} boom of {{the tower}} crane in the rotary plane is a cantilever structure with large flexibility. Its stability analysis belongs to critical load problems under double non-conservative forces. In this paper, the second-order theory is used to establish the deflection differential equation in the rotary plane of the horizontal boom. According to the deformation compatibility conditions and the boundary conditions, the exact expression of the deflection equation and the instability characteristic equation in the rotary plane are obtained. The premise of the stability analysis {{is to determine the}} force relationship of the two <b>pulling</b> <b>rods</b> in the horizontal boom with double lifting points, which is a statically indeterminate structure. This paper is aimed at the structural characteristics and the load forms of the general boom. For the calculation of the <b>pulling</b> <b>rod</b> forces in the boom, the general expression is deduced considering the variety of the cross-section, the load and the position of lifting points. A highly efficient method for the stability analysis of the horizontal boom with double <b>pulling</b> <b>rods</b> is provided by the analytic expression of the instability characteristic equation and the internal forces in the statically indeterminate <b>pulling</b> <b>rods.</b> Fig. 1 Horizontal boom model with double lifting points of tower crane...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to perform a comprehensive review of psychophysically determined maximum acceptable <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces. Factors affecting <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces are identified and discussed. Recent studies show a significant decrease (compared to previous studies) in maximum acceptable forces for males but not for females when <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> on a treadmill. A comparison of <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces measured using a high inertia cart with those measured on a treadmill shows that the <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces using high inertia cart are higher for males but are about the same for females. It is concluded that the recommendations of Snook and Ciriello (1991) for <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces are still valid and provide reasonable recommendations for ergonomics practitioners. Regression equations as a function of handle height, frequency of exertion and pushing/pulling distance are provided to estimate maximum initial and sustained forces for <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> acceptable to 75 % male and female workers. At present {{it is not clear whether}} <b>pushing</b> or <b>pulling</b> should be favored. Similarly, it is not clear what handle heights would be optimal for <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling.</b> Epidemiological studies are needed to determine relationships between psychophysically determined maximum acceptable <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces and risk of musculoskeletal injuries, in particular to low back and shoulders.

40|$|Although <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> is {{very common}} in {{occupational}} settings, this type of manual materials handling is less well studied than lifting and carrying. Several issues should be considered when obtaining exposure measures in epidemiological field studies on <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling.</b> The {{purpose of this article}} is threefold: (i) to critically evaluate different methods to assess <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> forces, (ii) to describe measures of exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling,</b> and (iii) to consider measurement strategies for assessment of exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling.</b> Firstly, information on the level of exerted forces with the accuracy needed for epidemiology can only be obtained from direct measurement methods. These methods are particularly required when <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> tasks are biomechanically analysed, implying that also force direction and point of application relative to the worker have to be assessed. Secondly, to obtain a limited number of external exposure measures that reflect exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> over time, aggregation of various force measurements is suggested. Internal exposure measures and parameters corresponding to guidelines are also described. Thirdly, for truck drivers and refuse collectors a strategy of approximately five repeated measurements for each representative working situation is advised to obtain a reliable estimate of an individual's exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling.</b> Relevance to industryAn overview is given of methods to assess forces accompanying <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling,</b> which are very common activities in industry. Examples of exposure measures and measurement strategies in studies on adverse health effects of <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> are presented. Such studies should eventually stimulate prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R

This thesis investigates if <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors leading into violent Islamic extremism differentiate between men and women. Furthermore, it assesses how preventive measures from The United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark targets <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors and if these are sensitive to sex. To fulfil this objective an exploratory thematic {{analysis was used to}} synthesise secondary qualitative research surrounding <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors. The <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factor analysis revealed three trends: there were limited variation in the overall categories describing the <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors present for men and women; what caused <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors to manifest differed according to sex; and, there were differences in how much men and women were affected by these factors. The assessment of prevention measures showed that none of the measures explicitly mentioned <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors, yet they all had the potential of targeting these. Sex was included in some aspects of the measures, but was not a consideration in relation to the targeting of <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors.

40|$|Objectives Low-back and {{shoulder}} complaints {{were examined in}} relation to self-reported and objectively assessed exposure to work-related <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling.</b> Methods Workers from several companies (eg, nursing homes and flower auctions) with <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> tasks and, as reference, workers without physically demanding tasks were invited to participate. Altogether 829 workers initially received a questionnaire, of whom 459 responded both initially and after I year of follow-up. Initially, self-reported exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> was assessed by questionnaire. Furthermore, {{a representative sample of}} 131 workers was observed at work using TRAC (task recording and analysis on computer) to assess exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> objectively. For exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling,</b> the workers were classified into a reference group and medium and high exposure groups. Initially and in the follow-up, the 12 -month prevalence of low-back {{and shoulder}} complaints was assessed. Complaints reported in the follow-up were separately used as dependent variables to calculate prevalence rate ratios (PR) in a Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis. Results The adjusted PR values were not significant for low-back complaints. For shoulder complaints, both the medium and high exposure groups showed significant adjusted PR values for self-reported exposure and observed duration of <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> when compared with the reference group (PR range 2. 18 - 4. 86). For the observed frequency of <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling,</b> only the medium exposure group showed a significant PR, of 3. 95.
