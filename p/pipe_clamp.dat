5000|$|A <b>pipe</b> <b>clamp</b> {{is a type}} of clamp often {{employed}} in woodworking, piping or cabinet shops. When referring to woodwork or cabinet shops, pipe clamps are usually composed of commercially manufactured clamp heads or [...] "jaws" [...] and a length of common threaded pipe. The capacity of the clamp is determined by the length of the pipe used. When referring to piping, pipe clamps are used to connect the pipe to the pipe hanger assembly.|$|E

50|$|Trim {{chains and}} shackles, or {{turnbuckles}} and <b>pipe</b> <b>clamps,</b> typically connect the lift {{lines of a}} line set to the batten they support. Those connections facilitate minor adjustments to, trim, the effective length of a lift line. By trimming the lift lines, loads are more evenly distributed to them. Turnbuckles are moused (secured against free rotation) to prevent the jaws from slowly unscrewing over time due to vibrations incurred during normal use.|$|R
50|$|A Structural pipe fitting, {{also known}} as a slip on pipe fitting, clamp or <b>pipe</b> <b>clamp</b> is used to build {{structures}} such as handrails, guardrails, and other types of pipe or tubular structure. They {{can also be used to}} build furniture and theatrical riggings. The fittings slip on the pipe and are usually locked down with a set screw. The set screw can then be tightened with a simple hex wench. Because of the modular design of standard fittings, assembly is easy, only simple hand tools are required, and risks from welding a structure are eliminated.|$|E
50|$|In woodwork, a <b>pipe</b> <b>clamp</b> uses clamp heads {{produced}} commercially {{by numerous}} manufacturers. They {{are available in}} various diameter sizes, commonly ½”or ¾”, suited to the same diameter piping. The pipe is usually threaded on both ends. One head is fixed on the pipe by spinning it onto standard pipe threads. This head includes the screw mechanism for tightening the clamp. The other, movable, head slides onto {{the other end of}} the pipe. This head has a mechanism, often a series of movable “clutches” which allow it to slide along the pipe when setting up the clamping operation but which lock onto the pipe when clamping pressure is applied.|$|E

It can be simply kept on steel structure for only rest type supports. To simultaneously restrict in another direction separate plate or Lift up Lug can be used. A pipe anchor is a rigid support that restricts movement in all three orthogonal directions and all three rotational directions, i.e. restricting al the {{6 degrees of freedom}} This usually is a welded stanchion that is welded or bolted to steel or concrete. In case of anchor which is bolted to concrete, a special type of bolt is required called Anchor Bolt, which is used to hold the support with concrete. In this type of support, normal force and friction force can become significant. To alleviate the frictional effect Graphite Pad or PTFE plates are used when required.|$|E

It is made based on the manufacturers desire to improve and make the clamp easier to manufacture and to reduce its price to their customers. This should be done either by manufacturing the clamp in one piece without an expensive and work intensive welding process, or by generating ideas of how to develop a brand new type of clamp. Investigating the market for similar products was done to eliminate intrusion of other manufacturers’ patents but also to generate ideas. Making drawings of the many ideas gave a concept of three concepts called existing clamp in one piece, existing clamp by several pieces and innovation solutions. Some of these ideas were investigated further and were 3 D modelled in pro-engineer and necessary drawing files were made {{to be used in}} the manufacturing of several prototypes. One of the solutions resulted in a prototype that was manufactured by handmade tools and the results of the tests was very positive. The clamp was strong enough to join the pipes together very well without breaking. It was manufactured in one piece and formed in five steps without any welding operations instead of the seven steps, including welding, that is used on the clamp today. The prototype requires 25 % more material and most of it is scrap from the cutting operation...|$|E

40|$|Corrosion {{damage in}} {{inaccessible}} regions presents a significant {{challenge to the}} petrochemical industry, and determining the remaining wall thickness is important to establish the remaining service life. Guided wave tomography is one solution to this and involves transmitting Lamb waves through the area of interest and, subsequently, using the received signals to reconstruct a thickness map of the remaining wall thickness. This avoids the need to access all points on the surface, making the technique well suited to inspection for areas with restricted access. The influence of these areas onto the ability to detect and size surface conditions, such as corrosion damage, using guided wave tomography is assessed. For that, a guided wave tomography system is employed, {{which is based on}} low-frequency A 0 Lamb waves that are excited and detected with two arrays of electromagnetic acoustic transducers. Two different defect depths are considered with different contrasts relative to the nominal wall thickness, both of which are smoothly varying and well-defined. The influence of areas with restricted surface access, support locations, <b>pipe</b> <b>clamps,</b> and STOPAQ(R) coatings is experimentally tested, and their influence assessed through comparison to a baseline reconstruction without the respective restriction in place, demonstrating only a small influence on the detected value of the remaining wall thickness...|$|R

The city of Boise, Idaho maintains the largest district {{geothermal heating}} system in the United States, utilizing a source of geothermal water at 80 °C. 304 Stainless steel (UNS S 30400) <b>pipe</b> <b>clamps</b> are used throughout the system as repair seals and for new service connections. Occasionally unexpected fracture of the stainless steel clamps occurs with time-in-service periods as short as 1 year. A failure analysis was conducted, including visual, microstructural, compositional, and mechanical characterization, to determine the cause and source of the degradation. Cracking of the clamps was limited to localized regions with {{the remainder of the}} clamp unaffected. Branched, brittle cracks were observed in the failure region and exhibited transgranular propagation. Based on the temperature, available moisture, stress level, and type of material used it was determined that the likely cause of failure was neutral pH, dilute chloride-induced stress corrosion cracking.

40|$|Today’s {{available}} softwarepackages {{that feature}} dedicated hydraulic system noise analysis capabilities {{focus on the}} Fluid-Borne Noise (FBN) prediction in frequency or time domain. However, some noise sensitive hydraulic installation areas, like light weight structures in aviation,drive {{the development of an}} extended toolbox that also covers the prediction of Structure-Borne Noise (SBN) and Fluid-Structure-Interaction (FSI) inhydraulic systems. This conference contribution presents the concept and design of such a toolbox. It is implemented in a Matlab Simulink/ Simscape environment by FBN-, SBN-and FSI-model libraries. For a given study case a simulation model is generated using elements from these libraries. The simulation results are experimentally validated using a dedicated hydraulic system noise test rig. It features a rotary valve as FBN source and a pipe system equipped with dynamic pressure transducers for FBN detection and acceleration sensors for SBN detection. The analysis capabilities of such a toolbox are considered beneficial in particular for future (pre-/re-) design projects in the aviation environment, which hold challenging application constraints for efficient hydraulic system noise reduction devices: Besides obligatory strong limits on component weight and size, the high safety and reliability standards demand simple and maintenance-free onboard devices. Hencesolutions with minimum hardware efforts are preferred. In this context, theproposed toolbox can be used for a combined tuning of type and location of standard/simple FBN silencers together with type and location of SBN effecting <b>pipe</b> <b>clamps</b> in order to optimize the overall system noise pattern towards an increased equipment durability and passenger comfort...|$|R
40|$|The {{prognosis}} {{of sound}} emission by building services is a current topic of European standardization, see e. g. prEN 12354 - 5 and prEN 14366. Although their sound level is comparatively low, water installations are particularly annoying sources of noise. In case of pipes or other sanitary installations sound is mostly caused by running water. The water-borne sound is converted into struc-ture-borne sound and transmitted {{into the building}} via wall-mounted <b>pipe</b> <b>clamps.</b> Apart from the acoustical properties of the source the sound transmission also depends on {{the interaction between the}} source and the excited building element. Therefore, suitable prediction models have to comprise both aspects. This paper is especially focused on the mutual interaction between two point sources and the excitation of different types of plates, respectively. The mass of the plates, the attachment of the sources and the source characteristics have been varied. According to the results of experiments and computations the transmission of structure-borne sound into building elements can frequently be de-scribed by a simple electromechanical model. Simultaneous excitation by two or more coupled point sources, however, can cause interference effects. In this case the vibration level of the element can be either higher (by at most 3 dB) or lower than for incoherent excitation. If the distance between the sources is small compared to the length of bending waves, interference strongly affects the acoustical behaviour. For distances which are large compared to the wavelength, the influence of interference can mostly be neglected...|$|R

The length of fibers is in the two types, the first type is long fibers (continuous) and the second is short fibers (discontinuous) for different length all at volume fraction of fibers, "f" (0. 15 & 0. 25).

40|$|Planting {{trees that}} weigh over 200 pounds {{normally}} requires {{three or more}} able persons. Therefore, a device that allows a single person to easily and efficiently plant such trees possible by one person is highly desirable. During a Product Design class in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a group of 14 students developed a series of four concept models which culminated in a Final Prototype of such a product that can successfully lift, move and plant trees of over 200 pounds. This paper is aimed at documenting this series of designs and analyzing, testing and further developing the Final Prototype built in the course {{in order to make}} it marketable. Based on customer feedback, testing results, and user interaction, revisions to the next prototype of this device are proposed. Testing with trees of 170 and 370 lbs determined that the current outrigger stabilizing mechanism needs modification. The current outriggers, which are stored inside the frame, sustained maximum loads of 29 lbs for the 170 lbs tree, and 46 lbs for the 370 lbs tree. A sketch model built to simulate the outrigger mechanism suggests that the outriggers should be attached outside the base frame of the device rather than stored inside. (cont.) The revised device is also to include two stacked <b>pipe</b> <b>clamps</b> for securing the vertical member members of the outriggers. The upper and lower frames are to be reduced in width from 42 to 36 inches, making the device more compact while still accommodating tree root balls of up to 3 feet in diameter. Nylon insulation of the current winch wire is necessary to prevent damage to tree trunks while operating the device. These design revisions will improve the performance of the device Final Prototype and are believed to make the revised device commercially viable on the product market. by Sean J.

40|$|The {{detection}} and characterisation of corrosion type defects on pipelines {{is a major}} challenge for the petrochemical industry, especially in regions with poor accessibility. Guided wave tomography is one feasible approach to inspect areas with restricted access by transmitting guided waves through the area and then processing the measured wave field into a thickness map of the pipeline wall, without having to take measurements at all points on the surface. The key objective of this research project is to develop, implement and test a prototype guided wave tomography system based on the A 0 Lamb mode. For {{the development of a}} guided wave tomography system a low-frequency, omni-directional A 0 Lamb wave ElectroMagnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) is developed, and operates at 0. 50 MHzmm on a steel plate. For that, a parametric Finite Element (FE) model is implemented in a commercially available FE software and a numerical optimization process employing a genetic algorithm is set up to optimised the EMAT design for an improved A 0 mode selectivity. The FE model is validated against measurements on an aluminium plate and on a steel plate. A two-step model-based design approach is proposed whereby only the Lorentz force is used in the first step for the optimisation and then in a second step, a realistic estimate of the mode selectivity can be obtained by additionally considering the magnetisation force. The optimised design fulfils the S 0 suppression design requirement and is integrated into the guided wave tomography system consisting of two ring arrays. The developed guided wave tomography system is tested on two steel pipes with smooth and well defined defect. The repeatability of measurements is assessed and the robustness of the guided wave tomography measurements to sensor position errors is investigated. It is demonstrated that there is a small influence on the thickness reconstruction for fairly large systematic and unsystematic position errors. Similar results are obtained for single sensor failures or gaps in the arrays and an increase in sensor spacing is found to increase reconstruction artefacts. With Golay complementary sequences, a signal processing technique is presented that allows for {{a significant increase in the}} data capture speed with the same performance as time averaging. Three areas with restricted access, support locations, <b>pipe</b> <b>clamps</b> and STOPAQ(R) coatings, are considered and their influence on the thickness reconstruction is investigated relative to a reference configuration and only a small influence is found in the experiments.

This study focuses {{on the effects of}} the impact location on the missile pipe and the wall thickness of the pipes. The experiments were carried out by using a spring-powered catapult impact setup, the specimens used were made of seamless steel pipes of two different thicknesses, 1 mm and 3 mm respectively, and the target <b>pipes</b> were <b>clamped.</b> Seven tests were carried out using the catapult. Numerical simulations using the explicit finite element code LS-DYNA were performed on an HPC 360 workstation for each of the seven test cases. The results of the experiments and numerical simulations were compared, showing good agreement. Having confirmed the validity of the numerical model, numerical simulations were applied to the cases of a simply-supported target pipe, and the partitioning of the energy dissipation was calculated. As the response mode depends significantly on the initial impact position, the evolution of the response mode was examined numerically as the point of impact on the missile pipe was moved from the hinged end to the free end. it was found that there is a particular impact location for which the target pipe was most seriously damaged using the same impact speed.
