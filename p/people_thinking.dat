25|$|There was {{political}} stability from the 1940s {{to the early}} 1970s; however, regionalism regained with <b>people</b> <b>thinking</b> of themselves as from their local city or municipality over the state. This regionalism impeded the economy as local authorities restrained outside goods. For this reason, construction of highways and communications were pushed to help with economic development. Most of the work was done around Tuxtla Gutiérrez and Tapachula. This included the Sureste railroad connecting northern municipalities such as Pichucalco, Salto de Agua, Palenque, Catazajá and La Libertad. The Cristobal Colon highway linked Tuxtla to the Guatemalan border. Other highways included El Escopetazo to Pichucalco, a highway between San Cristóbal and Palenque with branches to Cuxtepeques and LaFrailesca. This helped to integrate the state's economy, but it also permitted the political rise of communal land owners called ejidatarios.|$|E

The scene {{became one of the most}} notable moments of Divine's acting career, and he later complained of <b>people</b> <b>thinking</b> that [...] "I run around doing it all the time.
