5|$|In 2000, Biman <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> {{request for}} {{proposal}} for the acquisition of four wide-bodied aircraft to replace the DC–10s, but both the fleet renewal plans and the airline's expected privatisation were shelved by the government. A further attempt was made in 2005 to acquire new aircraft and plans were submitted {{for the purchase of}} ten new wide-bodied Airbus and Boeing aircraft at a total cost of $1billion. Boeing arranged to finance the purchase provided a guarantee was given by the Bangladesh government. After bureaucratic delays and a perceived lack of commitment from the government, Boeing lost interest and the plans were cancelled. A similar attempt to purchase medium-haul aircraft for domestic service was also postponed. In , Biman <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> tender for the dry lease of two Airbus A310-300 and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft for two years. The sole response to the tender came from Star Aviation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).|$|E
5|$|Most {{judgment}} calls made by {{the official}} scorer under this rule occur in three situations: when an infielder, pitcher, or catcher attempts to put out an unforced preceding runner who is attempting to advance one base, when any fielder attempts and fails to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> forced preceding runner, and when any fielder attempts and fails to put out an unforced preceding runner who returns to their original base. In these situations, the official scorer is required {{to determine whether the}} batter-runner would have safely reached first base if the defense made an ordinary effort to put him out. If the defense could not be reasonably expected to make the play, the batter is credited with a hit, otherwise he is ruled to have reached by fielder's choice. If an error is made on the attempt to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> preceding runner, that has no impact on this decision. It is instead noted to have occurred in addition to the hit or fielder's choice.|$|E

5|$|The {{sporting}} event was started at Little Wittenham Bridge in 1984 by the lockkeeper, Lynn David, as a fund-raising {{event for the}} Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).

He <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> box of sticks and a collection box and it soon became an annual event.|$|E
5|$|Although {{poliovirus}} transmission {{has been}} interrupted {{in much of}} the world, transmission of wild poliovirus does continue and creates an ongoing risk for the importation of wild poliovirus into previously polio-free regions. If importations of poliovirus occur, outbreaks of poliomyelitis may develop, especially in areas with low vaccination coverage and poor sanitation. As a result, high levels of vaccination coverage must be maintained. In November 2013, the World Health Organization announced a polio outbreak in Syria. In response, the Armenian government <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> notice asking Syrian Armenians under age 15 to get the polio vaccine. As of 2014, polio virus has spread out to ten countries mainly in Africa, Asia and the Middle East with Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon advising vaccinations to outbound travelers.|$|E
5|$|As Lennon hated doing {{a second}} take to double his vocals, Ken Townsend, the studio's {{technical}} manager, developed an alternative form of double-tracking called artificial double tracking (ADT) system, taking the {{signal from the}} sync head of one tape machine and delaying it slightly through a second tape machine. The two tape machines used were not driven by mains electricity, but from a separate generator which <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> particular frequency, the same for both, thereby keeping them locked together. By altering the speed and frequencies, he could create various effects, which the Beatles used throughout the recording of Revolver. Lennon's vocal is double-tracked on the first three verses of the song: {{the effect of the}} Leslie cabinet can be heard after the (backwards) guitar solo.|$|E

5|$|At {{one point}} MLSE {{contemplated}} purchasing the Toronto Blue Jays of MLB and Sportsnet from Rogers Communications, but {{concerns about the}} viability of SkyDome as a baseball venue and the profitability of the team resulted in the company not pursuing either. The company also considered investing in an English soccer club, and in May 2012, after the Leeds United Supporters Trust <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> request for a takeover from majority shareholder Ken Bates, {{it was reported that}} MLSE were in talks to buy the Football League Championship team. However, the company later denied that it planned to purchase the club. In 2015 reports emerged that MLSE was investigating taking over the bankrupt Parma F.C. of Italy's Serie A.|$|E
5|$|Bristol, {{the fifth}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, was named after the eponymous city. She was laid down on 23 March 1909 at John Brown & Company's Clydebank shipyard, {{launched}} on 23 February 1910 and completed on 17 December 1910. As of 18 February 1913, the ship was assigned to the 5th Battle Squadron of the reserve Second Fleet at Devonport. On 1 July, Bristol was transferred to the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Second Fleet. Almost six months later, some of her crewmen helped to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> fire in Portsmouth Dockyard on 20 December; two men were killed fighting the fire.|$|E

Randy agrees to help Douchebag recruit the Goths after Douchebag infiltrates the crash site and discovers that government agents are plotting {{to blow up the}} town in order to destroy an alien goo released from the ship. The goo turns living creatures into Adolf Hitler-esque Nazi Zombies; an infected person escapes government containment, unleashing the virus on South Park.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{cessation}} of open violence, the city set about forming two new regiments of national guard to expand available forces. The local news recounted on the 24th, that Abbot's engineer corps had re-purposed the armory of the 5th Regiment {{for use as a}} recruiting station, toward the goal of forming the now authorized 8th Regiment, to include a company of artillery. They brought with them from the armory of the 6th, two howitzers, 2,000 rounds of ammunition, and 250 muskets. The Governor and Adjutant General <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> call for volunteers to fill each regiment with 1,000 men. General James Howard was chosen to command the 7th, and General Charles E. Phelps the 8th.|$|E
5|$|In June 2007, the {{caretaker}} government approved a three-year Hajj policy aiming {{to alleviate the}} problems encountered during the previous two years. Hajj flights would also begin leaving from Bangladesh's two other international airports, Shah Amanat International Airport and Osmani International Airport. Biman <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> tender for the wet lease of two aircraft for additional Hajj flights and reached an agreement with Phuket Air. However, the deal fell through in August 2007 after Phuket Air demanded advance payment of 30% instead of the previously agreed-to 10%. Ausban Aeronautical Services of Australia was selected next, following a re-tender, {{to fill the gap}} left by Phuket Air. In 2008, Biman wet-leased a 542-seater Boeing 747-200 from Kabo Air of Nigeria for six months to operate flights to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Another 512-seater Boeing 747-300 was leased from Orient Thai Airlines.|$|E
5|$|In early June 1940 {{following}} the lightning {{advance of the}} Germans through France and the subsequent Dunkirk evacuation, the British prime minister, Winston Churchill, realised the need for Britain to maintain some form of offensive action and directed his chief staff officer and military adviser, General Hastings Ismay, to begin organising a force which could conduct raids {{along the coast of}} German-occupied Europe. Shortly after this, even before the concept had been fully developed, the War Office <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> request for volunteers among the troops in Britain to join a force they would be known as the Commandos. At this stage it was decided to create 12 commando units, each with an establishment of roughly 500 men.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} von Spee withdrew his ships, large {{portions}} of the town had been destroyed. Two entire blocks of Papeete had burnt to the ground before the fires were finally <b>put</b> <b>out.</b> <b>A</b> copra store, a market, and several other buildings and residences were among those destroyed by the shellfire and resulting inferno. While the majority of Papeete's civilians fled to {{the interior of the}} island as soon as the fighting began, a Japanese civilian and a Polynesian boy were both killed by German shellfire. Although the two French vessels in the harbor had been sunk, there were no military casualties on either side and the German vessels took no damage. Overall, the bombardment was estimated in 1915 to have caused over 2million francs' worth of property damage, some of which was recouped through the seizure of a German store on the island. In addition to the seizure of their property, several local Germans were interned and forced to repair the damage von Spee's squadron had caused. Perhaps the most lasting effect of the bombardment on the French was the dramatic fall of copra prices in the region, as local suppliers had previously sold a majority of their produce to German merchants in the area who were now interned. Further havoc and distress spread throughout the island 18 days after von Spee's squadron had left, when rumors started to spread that a second German bombardment was about to begin.|$|E
5|$|In 173, the Quadi rebelled and overthrew Furtius, who {{was their}} client-king {{appointed}} {{to them by}} Rome, and replaced him with Ariogaesus, who wanted {{to enter into negotiations}} with Marcus. As the success of the Marcomannic wars was in no danger, Marcus refused to negotiate. At that point only the Iazyges had not yet been defeated by Rome. Judging from the lack of action on Marcus Aurelius' part, it appears he was unconcerned, but when the Iazyges attacked across the frozen Danube in late 173 and early 174, Marcus redirected his attention to them. Trade restrictions on the Marcomanni were also partially lifted at that timethey were allowed to visit the Roman markets at certain times of certain days. In an attempt to force Marcus to negotiate, Ariogaesus began to support the Iazyges. Marcus Aurelius <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> bounty on him, offering 1,000 aurei for his capture and delivery to Rome, or 500 aurei for his severed head. After this, Ariogaesus was captured by the Romans, but rather than executing him, Marcus Aurelius sent him into exile.|$|E
5|$|On 27 January 1907, Sperber {{was present}} in Lomé {{for the opening of}} the first {{railroad}} line in German Togoland. Between 1908 and 1909, she conducted an extensive survey of the west-African coast. In February 1909, she visited the ruins of Groß Friedrichsburg, the old capital of the Brandenburger Gold Coast, a colony founded by Frederick William I of Prussia in the 17th century. She thereafter returned to survey work in Kamerun and Southwest Africa. On 6 March 1910, she was transferred to German East Africa to replace Bussard. While en route, her crew helped to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> major fire in Lüderitz Bay on 15 April. After arriving in East Africa, Sperber conducted the normal routine of visiting ports in the colony. She went to Cape Town for an overhaul from 26 October to 3 December. On 6 March 1911, she received orders to return to Germany for a second time. She arrived in Wilhelmshaven on 29 June, and was decommissioned again on 6 July. She was stricken from the naval register on 16 March 1912 and was thereafter used as a target ship until 1918. She was sold on 7 August 1920 and broken up for scrap in Hamburg in 1922.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} rapid transit along the Bloor–Danforth line's route {{was made in}} a 1910 report that was prepared by an American firm of transit consultants. This study had been commissioned by a special commission, which included City Controller Horatio Clarence Hocken and Mayor of Toronto Joseph Oliver. In their final report, the consultants suggested that the Prince Edward Viaduct, which spans the Don River Valley, should include a lower deck for a future subway. The lower deck was built, but the first plan for a line to use it was not made until June 15, 1933, when the TTC published a report which suggested construction of a subway and an expressway broadly following Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue. The estimated cost {{of the project was}} $120 million, but the plan was not implemented. Plans for a somewhat longer route, running east to west from Victoria Park Avenue to the Humber River, were proposed by the Toronto Planning Board in December 1943, although the report did not include costings. During the fall of 1911, the City of Toronto <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> tender for the construction of concrete tubes to carry a subway. However, when the cost of the subway was put to a referendum, the construction of the subway tunnels was rejected.|$|E
5|$|The figure {{arrives at}} Valestra's house but finds the gangster dead by Joker's hands. Joker has {{strapped}} a camera to Valestra's corpse {{and sees the}} murderer is not Batman. The figure escapes as the house explodes. Batman pursues the killer, but is interrupted {{by the police and}} rescued from arrest by Andrea. Andrea later explains that she and her father had been hiding in Europe from Valestra's mob, from whom he had embezzled money; her father repaid, but they <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> hit on him. Bruce now believes her father is the killer. Bruce ponders resuming his relationship with Andrea and giving up Batman. He notices a familiar-looking man in the background of the photo of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont: the man who would become the Joker. Joker visits Reeves and presses him for information; Reeves insists that Batman is the cloaked killer. He professes his ignorance but Joker believes Reeves needs to protect his reputation and poisons him. Reeves is taken to the hospital where Batman later breaks in and interrogates him. Reeves confesses he helped the Beaumonts escape and told Valestra's mob their location.|$|E

Mark {{explains}} that his death had to be faked after Holland <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> hit on him. After learning that Kate had been asking about him, he believed that she wanted to see him again. Mark explains that he has been living in the Blue Mountains and working as an abseiling instructor. Mark and Kate spend time together, which makes her boyfriend, Mason, jealous. Mark also catches up with Lucas and Kyle. He tries to persuade Kate that her future is with him and they kiss. But when Mason learns Mark has a girlfriend in Sydney, he tells Kate, resulting in a fight between himself and Mark. Mark tells Kate {{that he was going to}} propose to his girlfriend, but wanted to see where things stood between them first. Kate chooses Mason and Mark leaves. Months later, Mason runs into Mark in Lysterfield, where he asks for his help as Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) has been injured abseiling. Mark accompanies the group to the hospital, where he runs into Kate. Mark decides to stay in Erinsborough and is offered a job at Fitzgerald Motors by Danni Ferguson (Laura McIntosh).
