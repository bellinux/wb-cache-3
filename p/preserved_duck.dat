40|$|The 667 bp {{control region}} of {{mitochondrial}} DNA from 8 representative domestic duck breeds in China, which were all native <b>preserved</b> <b>duck</b> breeds, and a mallard (6 Anas zonorhyncha individuals) were sequenced. The genetic polymorphism and {{the origin of}} the 8 domestic ducks were analysed. The result showed that the haplotype diversity (Hd) and average nucleotide diversity (Pi) were 0. 67136 and 0. 19 %, respectively. Hd and Pi of Youxian Sheldrake were the highest in the 8 domestic duck breeds. Kimura- 2 parameter genetic distance between the breeds ranged from 0. 00056 to 0. 00414. The NJ phylogenetic tree and reduced median-joining network chart were constructed by the total 38 haplotypes and 96 sequences, which included 12 sequences of Anas platyrhynchos from GenBank, 6 sequences of Anas zonorhyncha from GenBank and 78 sequences of this study (72 domestic ducks and 6 Anas zonorhyncha). The maternal origin of the 8 domestic ducks all originated from Anas platyrhynchos...|$|E
50|$|The Labrador duck (Camptorhynchus labradorius) was a North American bird; {{it has the}} {{distinction}} of being the first endemic North American bird species to become extinct after the Columbian Exchange, with the last known sighting occurring in 1878 in Elmira, New York. It was already a rare duck before European settlers arrived, {{and as a result of}} its rarity information on the Labrador duck is not abundant, although some, such as its habitat, characteristics, dietary habits and reasons behind its extinction, are known. There are 55 specimens of the Labrador <b>duck</b> <b>preserved</b> in museum collections worldwide.|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the physiological responses and a performance of Pitalah ducks kept in different altitude and dietary protein level. It consisted of two phases. Phase I study aimed to determine the haematology and T 3 hormone (triiodotironine) and triglycerides of Pitalah <b>duck</b> <b>preserved</b> in its native habitat. Phase II study aimed to determine the Physiological responses and a performance Pitalah ducks kept in different altitude and dietary protein level. A total of 30 blood samples taken from 30 female Pitalah ducks {{being used in the}} production phase I study, further observed haemoglobin levels (Hb), erythrocytes, and hematocrit. Observations of T 3 hormone and triglycerides used blood serum. In the Phase II study, 120 of female Pitalah ducks 14 weeks old reared on high altitude (H) and 120 at low altitude (L). The research was carried out by using Split-plot arranged in Randomized Block Design with the H and L as Main-plot and dietary protein level (14, 16, and 18...|$|R
40|$|As our {{appreciation}} of migratory birds and {{our understanding of}} {{their role in the}} natural world grows, it’s important to recognize the critical contributions of sportsmen to migratory bird conservation efforts. For more than 60 years, hunters have provided a steady stream of revenue to build the National Wildlife Refuge System, and to restore waterfowl habitat on millions of acres of public and private lands across the country. These habitat projects also benefit migratory songbirds and other wildlife. In the early 1930 s, the accumulated impacts of plundered forests, heedlessly plowed grasslands, and commercial exploitation of wildlife from {{the turn of the century}} were brought sharply into focus by the worst drought and the worst economic depression in America’s history. People realized something needed to be done. With a handful of farsighted conservationists leading the way, organized sportsmen were instrumental in the creation of two programs that changed the course of wildlife conservation. The Duck Stamp Program On March 16, 1934, Congress passed and President Roosevelt signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act. Popularly known as the Duck Stamp Act, it required all waterfowl hunters 16 years or older to buy a Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp annually. In the years since its enactment, the Federal Duck Stamp Program has generated more than $ 501 million that has been used to preserve nearly five million acres of waterfowl habitat in the United States. Many of the more than 500 national wildlife refuges have been paid for all or in part by Duck Stamp money. Waterfowl are not the only wildlife to benefit from Federal Duck Stamps. Numerous other birds, wildlife and plants have similarly prospered because of habitat protection made possible by the program. Further, an estimated one third of the nation’s endangered and threatened species find food or shelter in refuges <b>preserved</b> by <b>Duck</b> Stamp funds. Outdoor enthusiasts have gained places to hike, bird watch or merely visit. Moreover, the protected wetlands help dissipate storms, purify water supplies, store flood water and provide food for many migratory birds. In recent years, Duck Stamp sales to hunters have declined as the number of Americans who hunt has decreased. The proportion of Duck Stamps purchased by non-hunters, however, has increased nearly 360 percent. Non-hunters now account for 13. 4 percent of Duck Stamp sales, contributing millions of dollars to wetland restoration efforts...|$|R
