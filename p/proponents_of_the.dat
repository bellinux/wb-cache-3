40|$|In 1632, Galileo Galilei wrote a {{book called}} Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems which {{compared}} the new Copernican model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe with the old Ptolemaic model. His book took <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a dialogue between three philosophers, Salviati, a <b>proponent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Copernican model, Simplicio, a <b>proponent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ptolemaic model, and Sagredo, who was initially open-minded and neutral. In this paper, I am going to use Galileo's idea to present a dialogue between three modern philosophers, Mr. Spock, a <b>proponent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> view that P≠NP, Professor Simpson, a <b>proponent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> view that P = NP, and Judge Wapner, who is initially open-minded and neutral.

5|$|Progressive {{big band}} is {{a style of}} big band or swing music that was made for listening, with denser, more modernistic {{arrangements}} and more room to improvise. The online music guide AllMusic states that, along with Kenton, musicians like Gil Evans, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Cal Massey, Frank Foster, Carla Bley, George Gruntz, David Amram, Sun Ra, and Duke Ellington were major <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> style.|$|E
5|$|<b>Proponents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use of {{leverage}} argue that using leverage can be risk-reducing rather than risk-increasing provided four conditions are met: (i) enough unencumbered cash is kept to meet any margin calls (ii) leverage {{is applied to}} a well-diversified portfolio (iii) assets can be rebalanced frequently and (iv) counterparty risk is minimized.|$|E
5|$|Retrograde {{signaling}} {{is currently}} a contentious subject as some investigators {{do not believe the}} presynaptic cell contributes at all to the expression of LTP.

Early thoughts focused on nitric oxide, while most recent evidence points to cell adhesion proteins.|$|E

5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E
5|$|In January 1965, the Department of the Interior {{completed}} its three-volume, 1,000-page {{study of the}} Rampart project's feasibility and impact. The Fish and Wildlife study released in 1964 was included, as were studies of {{the impact on the}} region's Alaska Native population. United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall then created a task force to review the findings before he made a final decision. Throughout 1965 and 1966, opponents and <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project funded studies of their own, aimed either at supporting or rejecting the arguments for the dam.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} before the FairTax is implemented, {{there could be}} a strong {{incentive}} for individuals to buy goods without the sales tax using credit.

5|$|Lower {{courts are}} split {{on whether the}} Clause {{requires}} that the defendant be tried in a judicial district that was in existence {{at the time the}} crime was committed. Some courts have held that it does. Others have held that it does not and that the district need only be ascertained prior to trial. Even <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former view have found no infirmity when Congress prospectively divides a judicial district, but retains the former configuration for past offenses.|$|E
5|$|Martin Nyrop {{was one of}} {{the main}} <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Romantic style. The main aim was to use {{distinctive}} Nordic motifs from the distant past, as is clearly demonstrated in Copenhagen City Hall which was completed in 1905. The City Hall is certainly Copenhagen's most monumental and most original building from the last quarter of the 19th century with its impressive facade, the golden statue of Absalon just above the balcony and its tall, slim clock tower. It was inspired by the Siena City Hall.|$|E
5|$|<b>Proponents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act, {{including}} Trumbull and Wilson, {{argued that}} Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment authorized {{the federal government}} to legislate civil rights for the States. Others disagreed, maintaining that inequality conditions were distinct from slavery. Seeking more substantial justification, and fearing that future opponents would again seek to overturn the legislation, Congress and the states added additional protections to the Constitution: the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) defining citizenship and mandating equal protection under the law, and the Fifteenth Amendment (1870) banning racial voting restrictions.|$|E

5|$|The NPVIC {{does not}} include any {{provision}} for a nationwide recount {{in the event that}} the vote tally is in dispute. While each state has established rules governing recounts {{in the event of a}} close or disputed statewide tally, it is possible for the national vote to be close without there being a close result in any one state. <b>Proponents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compact argue that the need for a recount would be less likely under a national popular vote than under the current electoral system.|$|E
5|$|The discography of Iron Maiden, a British {{heavy metal}} band founded in 1975 by bassist Steve Harris, {{includes}} sixteen studio albums, {{as well as}} numerous live albums, compilations, EPs, singles, video albums, music videos, and box sets. After several auditions and changes, the final lineup consisted of vocalist Paul Di'Anno, guitarists Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton, and drummer Clive Burr. They released their self-titled debut album in 1980; quickly {{becoming one of the}} leading <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new wave of British heavy metal movement.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century common {{concepts}} of what should be protected in national parks invariably included formidable geologic features like mountains, geysers, or canyons. As Florida's population began to grow significantly and urban areas near the Everglades were developed, <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park's establishment faced difficulty in persuading {{the federal government and the}} people of Florida that the subtle and constantly shifting ecosystems in the Everglades were just as worthy of protection. When the park was established in 1947, it became the first area within the U.S. to protect flora and fauna native to a region as opposed to geologic scenery. The National Park Service recognizes nine distinct interdependent ecosystems within the park that constantly shift in size owing to the amount of water present and other environmental factors.|$|E

5|$|Bormann {{used his}} {{position}} {{to create an}} extensive bureaucracy and involve himself {{as much as possible}} in the decision making. He gained acceptance into Hitler's inner circle, and accompanied him everywhere, providing briefings and summaries of events and requests. He began acting as Hitler's personal secretary on 12 August 1935. Bormann assumed Hess' former duties, with the title of Head of the Parteikanzlei (Party Chancellery), after Hess' solo flight to Britain on 10 May 1941 to seek peace negotiations with the British government. He had final approval over civil service appointments, reviewed and approved legislation, and by 1943 had de facto control over all domestic matters. Bormann was one of the leading <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ongoing persecution of the Christian churches and favoured harsh treatment of Jews and Slavs in the areas conquered by Germany during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Bormann {{was one of}} {{the leading}} <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ongoing {{persecution}} of the Christian churches. In February 1937 he decreed that members of the clergy should not be admitted to the NSDAP. The following year he ruled that any members of the clergy who were holding party offices should be dismissed, and that any party member who was considering entering the clergy had to give up his party membership. While Bormann's push to force the closure of theological departments at Reich universities was unsuccessful, he was able {{to reduce the amount of}} religious instruction provided in public schools to two hours per week and mandated the removal of crucifixes from classrooms. Speer notes in his memoirs that while drafting plans for Welthauptstadt Germania, the planned rebuilding of Berlin, he was told by Bormann that churches were not to be allocated any building sites.|$|E
5|$|Candidate state {{reptiles}} are not {{assured of}} making it through the legislative process. In Minnesota, 1998 and 1999 bills proposing the Blanding's turtle were unsuccessful. In Pennsylvania in 2009, the House passed an eastern box turtle bill which died in the Senate without a vote. Virginia <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern box turtle have seen 1999 and 2009 bids fail. For the most recent attempt, a legislative opponent of the turtle {{said it was too}} cowardly for the state because of its defensive shell, and suggested the rattlesnake would be a better representative. The turtle also drew scorn for often perishing on roads, but its most serious problem was a too-close association with bordering state, North Carolina.|$|E
