More specifically, only the CA1 region of the hippocampus seemed to demonstrate a significant reduction in size. The CA1 subsection of the hippocampus was 20% smaller in offspring from mothers who were fed a <b>protein</b> <b>deficient</b> <b>diet</b> while pregnant. Because the region of the hippocampus affected by protein malnutrition is so specific, global hippocampal function is not impaired, but rather just the function that would appear to be associated with the CA1.

40|$|Myths about horse {{nutrition}} have persisted {{for many}} years. In general, myths may persist {{because they are}} more interesting than the truth. People may prefer to believe the myth {{for a variety of reasons}} or the myths have not been questioned. The following is a discussion of four myths related to protein nutrition: Myth 1. Too much protein causes a horse to become overly spirited. Although there is some evidence that high intake of soluble carbohydrate can make a horse become more easily agitated (Pagan et al., 1987; McKenzie et al., 2003), there is no evidence that excess proteins will have an adverse effect. Of course if the horse is fed a <b>protein</b> <b>deficient</b> <b>diet,</b> feed intake may decrease and the horse will become subdued. Feeding protein above the requirement, however, is not likely to cause behavioral problems. For example, young horses fed a diet containing a low 9 % protein for 140 days consumed only 2. 7 kg of feed daily and gained only 0. 06 kg per day. They were subdued compared to horses fed 14 % or 20 % protein that consumed 4. 4 and 4. 7 kg of feed and gained 0. 63 and 0. 69 kg daily, respectively. But no obvious behavioral differences were noted between the two groups fed 14 % or 20 % protein (Schryver et al., 1987). Myth 2. A high protein diet increases the incidence of skeletal problems such as osteochondrosis in young horses. Excess protein per se does not increase skeletal problems. Skeletal problems, however, may be correlated with excessive growth rate. If the horses are fed a <b>protein</b> <b>deficient</b> <b>diet,</b> growth rate will decrease and the incidence of some skeletal problems might be decreased. Feeding a <b>protein</b> <b>deficient</b> <b>diet</b> to reduce growth rate and therefore skeletal problems, is not recommended because it could result in deficiencies of other nutrients and thus other developmental problems. Increasing the protein content above the requirement, however, is not likely to increase the rate of gain (NRC, 1989) ...|$|E
40|$|Both ethanol {{abuse and}} protein {{deficiency}} {{are well known}} associations of chronic pancreatitis. An early event in chronic pancreatitis is the deposition of protein plugs in small pancreatic ducts, leading to ductular obstruction and acinar cell damage. Lithostathine, a pancreatic secretory protein, is a major organic component of protein plugs. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of chronic ethanol administration and dietary protein deficiency, separately and in combination, on messenger RNA (mRNA) levels for pancreatic lithostathine. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed in groups of four, for four weeks, protein sufficient and <b>protein</b> <b>deficient</b> <b>diets</b> with or without ethanol. Messenger RNA levels for pancreatic lithostathine were assessed in all four groups. Both ethanol and protein deficiency, separately and in combination, increased mRNA levels for lithostathine.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of alcoholic pancreatitis is {{not fully}} understood. An increase in pancreatic digestive and lysosomal enzyme synthesis because of ethanol consumption could {{contribute to the development}} of pancreatic injury in alcoholics. This study aimed, firstly, to determine the effect of ethanol on the content and messenger RNA levels of pancreatic digestive enzymes and on the messenger RNA level of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B, and secondly, to examine the influence of concomitant protein deficiency (a known association of alcoholism and pancreatic injury) on these effects. A rat model of chronic ethanol administration was used in which rats were fed in groups of four, and for four weeks, protein sufficient and <b>protein</b> <b>deficient</b> <b>diets</b> with or without ethanol. Ethanol increased the pancreatic content of lipase but did not influence chymotrypsinogen or trypsinogen values. mRNA levels for lipase, trypsinogen, and chymotrypsinogen were raised in rats fed ethanol. Protein deficiency resulted in reduced tissue levels of lipase, chymotrypsinogen, and amylase but did not influence trypsinogen values. mRNA levels for proteases were increased in <b>protein</b> <b>deficient</b> rats, while those for lipase remained unaltered. Both ethanol and protein deficiency increased mRNA levels for cathepsin B.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of using {{free amino acids}} (AAs) as dietary constituent is sometimes {{lower than that of}} AAs derived from intact protein. The aim of the project was to evaluate dietary management conditions, which can determine the {{efficiency of}} utilization of crystalline AAs in animal diets or in clinical nutrition. The studies in this thesis were focused mainly on differences in short-term catabolism between protein bound and free AAs during the post prandial phase of a meal. The stable isotope technique was used in model studies with laboratory Wistar (WU) rats. In different experiments, so-called [13 CO 2]-breath test studies were used to compare the metabolic fate of free and protein-bound [1 - 13 C]-labeled AAs in a meal in various nutritional situations. The influence of free AA supplementation strategies on weight gain development was also studied. Moreover, protein and fat content in the liver and carcass were analysed. The {{results of the present study}} confirm literature that showed a higher post prandial catabolic losses of the tracer when dietary protein is replaced with crystalline AAs. In some, but not all situations a lower weight gain was observed for growing animals. Our results showed that short-term c atabolic losses of endogenous leucine were modulated by exogenous AA supply. It increased or decreased depending on the adequacy of the dietary supply. The common practice for free AA supplementation is to mix it with the <b>deficient</b> <b>protein.</b> In our study we showed that during the post prandial period the best utilization of methionine <b>deficient</b> <b>protein</b> did not occur when methionine supplement was given simultaneously with methionine deficient meal. The best utilisation occurred when there was a delay between the supply of deficient meal and free methionine. Therefore, introducing time interval of free amino acid supplementation to poor quality protein should be considered as a factor with potential to improve physiological utilization of dietary amino acids. A 1 h time interval for free methionine supplementation influenced the weight gain, but differently depending on the protein level. Animals fed very <b>deficient</b> <b>protein</b> <b>diet</b> (5 %) showed higher weight gain when supplementation of the deficient free methionine was provided with a 1 h delay (1 h interval). With <b>protein</b> <b>deficient</b> <b>diets</b> and less than 7. 5 % protein we found fatty livers in our experiment. We concluded that post prandial AA oxidation influences the post absorptive AA catabolism. This does not always mean effect on growth. For growth in rats lysine deficiency is most limiting but it seems that even a 34 % methionine deficiency below the NRC recommendation did not limit growth. We found that methionine deficiency influenced fat metabolism and from the literature we concluded that the mechanism probably works via choline and carniti...|$|R

Therefore, current study is directed to investigate the possible effects of <b>protein</b> <b>deficient</b> <b>diet</b> on the therapeutic activity and toxicity of paclitaxel in mice bearing Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells. Administration of a single dose of Paclitaxel (10 mg kg - 1, i. p.) decreased the tumor volume significantly in normally-fed animal (23 %), while animals on deficient protein diet, the tumor volume decreased non significantly amounting to 13 %. The long term survivors were increased by 58 % in normally fed tumor bearing animals compared to only 20 % in protein malnourished bearing animals after treatment with the same dose of paclitaxel.

The capacity for intralysosomal proteolysis, {{as shown by}} sensitivity to methylamine or lysosomal protease inhibitors, fell 55 - 75 % in muscles from PD rats. Furthermore, extracts of muscles of PD rats showed 30 - 70 % lower activity of many lysosomal proteases, including cathepsins B, H, and C, and carboxypeptidases A and C, {{as well as other}} lysosomal hydrolases. The fall in cathepsin B and proteolysis was evident by 3 days on the PD diet, and both returned to control levels 3 days after refeeding of the normal diet. In muscles maintained under optimal conditions, 80 - 90 % of protein breakdown occurs by nonlysosomal pathways. In muscles of PD rats, this ATP-dependent process was also 40 - 60 % slower. Even though overall proteolysis decreased in muscles of PD rats, their capacity for Ca(2 +) -dependent proteolysis increased (by 66 %), as did the activity of the calpains (+ 150 - 250 %).

The feeding patterns of 10 cross-bred pigs were measured by continuous recordings of feed-bin weights, in a double reversal design experiment. The pigs, fed ad libitum, ate an average of 9 "meals" per day (range 5 - 16) with an average meal size of 170 g. There was a distinct diurnal pattern of food intake; most meals were eaten in the light phase of the day with peaks {{in the early morning}} and at midday and a large peak mid afternoon. Pigs fed the <b>deficient</b> <b>diet</b> showed some depression in food intake on the first day and the depression had reached maximal levels by the third day. On the <b>deficient</b> <b>diet</b> pigs ate 17 - 20 % less than on the supplemented diet and most of the depression in intake was accounted for by reduced meal size. In the second experiment 4 pigs were trained to eat their daily ration in a 2 h period (0900 - 1100 h) and catheters were placed in the jugular veins. A double reversal experimental design was employed, with 3 periods of 5 days, and blood samples were taken over the feeding time on the second and fifth day in each period. The levels of plasma Glucose, Urea, Amino acids, Cortisol, Insulin, and Growth Hormone were measured. There {{were no significant differences between}} diets in levels of Growth Hormone or Cortisol. On day 2, Urea levels were higher in pigs fed the supplemented diet, while on day 5 there were no significant differences between diets. The lowered food intake on the <b>deficient</b> <b>diet</b> meant that both protein quality and protein intake were altered, which may explain the differences in Urea levels. The most consistent differences in plasma Amino acids levels occurred with tryptophan, the limiting amino acid, for which the levels were lower in pigs fed the <b>deficient</b> <b>diet,</b> although the differences were not statistically significant. Glucose rose higher in pigs fed the <b>deficient</b> <b>diet</b> and the differences could not be attributed to an altered Insulin response to feeding the <b>deficient</b> <b>diet.</b> It was concluded that the early changes in glucose and tryptophan may be associated with the food intake depression on the <b>deficient</b> <b>diet,</b> but further studies would be required before the relative importance of either relationship could be established...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} study was to assess effect of supplementation of high zinc or vitamin A on immune function. After three months of feeding with a zinc and vitamin A <b>deficient</b> <b>diet,</b> mice were assigned into four groups which, for additional two months, received a normal or high zinc along with vitamin A <b>deficient</b> <b>diet</b> and a normal or high vitamin A along with zinc <b>deficient</b> <b>diet.</b> Serum and intestinal mucosa immunoglobulin A (IgA) were determined and supernatants of splenocytes were used to assess interlukin (IL) - 2, IL- 5, IFN-γ. Mice maintained on zinc <b>deficient</b> <b>diet</b> with normal or high vitamin A resulted in significantly lower production of IFN-γ. Also, supplementation of high dose vitamin A augmented production of the cytokine as compared to normal intake of the vitamin. Supplementation of either normal or high zinc along with low vitamin A diet significantly led to higher production of IFN-γ as compared to those receiving zinc limited but adequate vitamin A. High intake of zinc along with vitamin A <b>deficient</b> <b>diet</b> significantly enhanced secretion of IL- 2. Levels of serum and mucosal IgA and IL- 5 were not be significantly modulated.

Poor nutritional status contributes to mortality through weakened host defenses against various pathogens. The primary goal {{of this study was}} to assess the contribution of a reduced protein diet to the outcomes of C. difficile infection in a murine model. C 57 BL/ 6 mice were fed a traditional house chow or a defined diet with either 20 % protein or 2 % protein and infected with C. difficile strain VPI 10463. Animals were monitored for disease severity, clostridial shedding and fecal toxin levels. Select intestinal microbiota were measured in stool and C. difficile growth and toxin production were quantified ex vivo in intestinal contents from untreated or antibiotic-treated mice fed with the different diets. C. difficile infected mice fed with defined diets, particularly (and unexpectedly) with <b>protein</b> <b>deficient</b> <b>diet,</b> had increased survival, decreased weight loss, and decreased overall disease severity. C. difficile shedding and toxin in the stool of the traditional diet group was increased compared with either defined diet 1 day post infection. Mice fed with traditional diet had an increased intestinal Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio following antibiotic exposure compared with either a 2 % or 20 % protein defined nutrient diet. Ex vivo inoculation of cecal contents from antibiotic-treated mice showed decreased toxin production and C. difficile growth in both defined diets compared with a traditional diet. Low protein diets, and defined nutrient diets in general, were found to be protective against CDI in mice. Associated diet-induced alterations in intestinal microbiota may influence colonization resistance and clostridial toxin production in a defined nutrient diet compared to a traditional diet, leading to increased survival. However, mechanisms which led to survival differences between 2 % and 20 % protein defined nutrient diets need to be further elucidated...|$|E
40|$|Why should so much {{attention}} be given to beef and chicken when many wild animals {{could be used to}} provide more flavoufful protein at a lower cost ? According to recent research, game ranching and the raising of small, wild animals that are both prolific and adapted to the local environment offer considerable potential. In many regions of the world, particularly Africa, hunting provides {{an important part of the}} meat consumed by local people. And in some isolated areas, it often provides all of the meat. In Zaire, for example, 87 % of the animal protein consumed comes from hunting or fishing with people eating on average more than 20 Og of game meat per day. Even in densely populated countries like Nigeria, hunting still provides about 20 % of the animal protein. In the Cote d'lvoire, it is estimated that the annual consumption of wild meat is worth about 50 billion Fcfa. This gives an idea of the importance of this sector which tends to be underestimated, if not totally ignored, by official statistics. Game meat, which is highly regarded by both rural and urban dwellers, can be found in all markets, in roadside stands, and on the menus of restaurants in urban areas. It sells very well, often for high prices when supplies are low, and thus makes hunting a profitable activity. A major consideration, however, is that huntinq is illegal in most ACP countries, including many in Africa where a widespread poaching industry has developed. When done with traditional techniques and limited to provisioning local needs, poaching generally poses little threat to wildlife. Except for areas where the human population has exceeded the carrying capacity of the local environment, most hunting activity tends to be predatory, not destructive. But when done systematically with modern techniques and arms poaching can result in the decimation of wildlife populations. Environmental degradation, the extension of cultivated lands and the reduction of forest cover, all exacerbate this situation. Wildlife stocks are decreasing almost everywhere and some species are being threatened with extinction. National parks and game reserves have been established to protect wildlife but such areas are seen as sources of a forbidden food by their often hungry human neighbours. Local people resent not being allowed to hunt such animals, especially when they damage their crops, eat their chickens or transmit diseases to their livestock. Poaching is thus a permanent temptation and often the only way to feed one's family. Traditional game reserves may thus help endangered species to survive and attract tourists but they usually offer little to their neighbours. But this need not necessarily be the case. With better management it is possible to increase the production of wildlife in order to supply more meat to local people and encourage rural development. Because local wildlife is perfectly adapted to local conditions, it has many advantages over domesticated animals. Wild herbivores, for example, can withstand prolonged droughts because their concentrated urine and faeces, as well as high body temperatures, enable them to reduce transpiration and thus retain body moisture. Some of them can literally survive, if not flourish, by consuming only the morning dew. Such animals are able to live on marginal lands, where domesticated animals cannot, because the mixture of species enables a more efficient use of local resources. Some browse only on grasses, others on shrubs or litter, while still others prefer to forage on roots that they uncover. Under normal conditions, therefore, they do not contribute to overgrazing but actually help to maintain an ecological balance. Furthermore, with high birth and growth rates, they have a high production capacity. Last but not least, wild animals are highly resistant to local diseases, particularly trypanosomiasis which decimates cattle in humid areas. Game ranching The protection and systematic hunting of wildlife can thus make substantial contributions to the development of marginal lands. Such 'game ranching' basically consists of improving wildlife habitat and controlling hunting. By ensuring an ecological balance between species, especially large carnivores, one can increase the numbers of wild herbivores such as antelopes, buffaloes or zebras whose natural body weight outshines that of famished lookina cattle. To be successful, wildlife management must not only inform local people but involve them in such activities to ensure that they benefit from them. In this way, they have an investment to protect, whether it be a better food supply or the income generated directly or indirectly by tourism. Guiding safaris or selling trophies, skins and local crafts can provide complementary sources of income for people living near such attractions. These projects are being planned in many countries, notably in the Sahel, in order to reduce environmental degradation, desertification and migration to the cities. Game ranching is already practised in some African countries. Antelopes, for example, are now being studied in the Cote d'lvoire and Zaire in order to determine the most appropriate techniques for raising such animals. Both their behaviour and the slaughtering methods used differ from those of cattle requiring people who have been well trained for such activities. According to the results of initial research, it seems that game ranches involving several species are more cost-effective than standard cattle ranching. Game ranching need not be limited to animals designed to replace cattle. Crocodiles, for example, produce not only their highly valued skin but also an edible meat. Contrary to their image, they are more lethargic than vicious and are excellent producers, transforming 2 kg of feed into 1 kg of meat. Furthermore, they hardly take up much space given their predilection for clambering on top of each other: small ponds are enough to keep them happy. In Thailand, where crocodile meat is not eaten, it is used as animal feed once the valuable skin is removed. For over 15 years, Papau-New Guinea has had a crocodile farming programme designed to conserve natural resources while improving the standard of life of local people. The hunting of young animals was outlawed and people were encouraged to protect and capture such crocodiles in order to raise them. The sale of skin from old animals was not only permitted but encouraged. In addition to large farming operations, many small farms were established at the village level. Several such experiences have been undertaken in Kenya and Zimbabwe and an experimental crocodile farm was started in 1982 at the Abidjan zoo. In Madagascar, turtle farming has been going on for several years providing not only the precious shell but also the meat used for turtle soup and other local dishes. Other species, such as antelopes, are also candidates for such farming activities, but not enough is yet known to ensure a cost-effective operation. Non conventional breeding Antelopes and crocodiles are not the only alternative supplies of protein. Research has now begun on 'mini-livestock' and the initial results are promising. This concerns small, native animals that are already quite familiar to many African hunters. Rodents, for example, are particularly favoured by some people who consume considerable numbers. Some are already domesticated, like the guinea pigs that are commonly kept and fed with kitchen wastes. Traditionally regarded simply as laboratory animals, guinea pigs have not been studied for their food production potential in rural areas. Their undemanding and prolific nature, however, is a major advantage. Among small rodents, considerable attention is given to the Gambia rat and the cane rat. These two species produce a succulent meat that is appreciated to such an extent in Central and West Africa that its price in cities often exceeds that of beef. The Gambia rat has been raised experimentally since 1982 at the University of Kinshasa. When treated well under captivity, this notoriously vicious rat becomes quite docile. Given its burrowing nature, it must be kept in metal cages, but it feeds quite well on leaves and grain. Research on the cane rat Tryonomys swinderianus, a native African species which can weigh 8 kg when mature, is even more advanced. It can be kept in cages or enclosures provided that the fence is high enough. It feeds primarily on green fodder, particularly the young, tender shoots of sugarcane or maize that it carefully peels. The females bear two litters per year of 4 to 6 young on average. Although many do not survive the first few weeks, those that do adapt well to captivity. Some of the first research on the cane rat was done in the 1970 's in Nigeria, Ghana and the. Cote d'lvoire. It was taken up again in 1984 in Benin where attention was given to selecting among the 600 wild animals collected for a strain adapted to semi-intensive farming with good growth rates, high reproduction levels and a docile character The follow-up of this programme envisaged an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of such farming as well as the methods appropriate for rural use. At the same time, the Central Laboratory for Animal Nutrition in the Cote d'lvoire began working on the development of feed farms based on local agroindustrial residues. Another project, in Zaire, plans to start field trials next year on such farms in rural development centres before launching an extension programme for small farmers. Many people have shown interest in cane rats because of the high prices received for their meat. It seems a little premature, however, to make investments in this field before more research is done. Another non-conventional protein source worthy of attention is snails, particularly giant snails which can be up to 30 cm long and weigh over 500 g. Well known to local people who appreciate such luxuries (it is estimated that 500 tonnes of fresh snails are consumed per year in Abidjan in addition to smoked snails), these creatures are relatively easy to raise as they can be fed on wastes, by-products and leaves. Smaller strains are even exported to Europe where snail production does not meet demand. A pilot project in the Cote d'lvoire is currently investigating the best farming methods. Apart from human consumption, dried and ground snails can replace imported animal feed, particularly for poultry farming. Furthermore, these gasterpods can transform agricultural wastes into excellent compost. The same is true for earthworms that can be used, either fresh or pulverized, as a feed in pig and poultry farms while also producing a good compost. If just established in Western countries, vermiculture remains to be developed in the tropics. Other animals and some insects more than make up for this lag. One may conclude that there are numerous protein sources found in nature for both people and domestic animals but they are often not well known. If one looks beyond the standard Western model, however one can find many kinds of alternative protein sources including both large and mini-livestock that are well adapted to the local environment and familiar to consumers. By providing a complementary food source for an often <b>protein</b> <b>deficient</b> <b>diet,</b> while increasing supplies to the cities and thus the incomes of rural residents, game ranching or minilivestock can improve both food self-sufficiency and rural employment. To exploit this opportunity, researchers and development workers must get off the beaten track and propose simple solutions that local people can really benefit from. BIBLIOGRAPHY: J.

Twenty-four male Lewis rats were fed a thiamine <b>deficient</b> <b>diet,</b> which contained 0. 04 % of normal thiamine intake. Six control rats were fed 200 mu g of thiamine per day. Every week a group of six rats on the thiamine-deficient diet was sacrificed and blood, urine and tissue were stored. Blood and tissue transketolase activity, thiamine and thiamine metabolites were measured and PCR of thiamine transporter- 1 (ThTr- 1) was performed. Transketolase activity was significantly reduced in red blood cells, liver, lung, kidney and spleen tissue after two weeks of thiamine <b>deficient</b> <b>diet.</b> In brain tissue, transketolase activity was not reduced after up to four weeks of thiamine <b>deficient</b> <b>diet.</b> The amount of thiamine pyrophosphate was also significantly conserved in brain and heart tissue (decrease of 31 % and 28 % respectively), compared to other tissues (decrease of similar to 70 %) after four weeks of thiamine <b>deficient</b> <b>diet.</b> There was no difference between tissues in ThTr- 1 expression after four weeks of thiamine <b>deficient</b> <b>diet.</b> Despite the fact that the heart and the brain are predilection sites for complications from thiamine deficiency, these tissues are protected against thiamine deficiency. Other organs could be suffering from thiamine deficiency without resulting in clinical signs of classic thiamine deficiency in beriberi and Wernicke's encephalopathy. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
