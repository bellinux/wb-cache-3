25|$|A {{fundamental}} {{premise of}} REBT is humans {{do not get}} emotionally disturbed by unfortunate circumstances, but by how they construct their views of these circumstances through their language, evaluative beliefs, meanings and philosophies about the world, themselves and others. This concept has been attributed {{as far back as}} the Roman philosopher Epictetus, who is often cited as utilizing similar ideas in antiquity. In REBT, clients usually learn and begin to apply this premise by learning the A-B-C-D-E-F model of <b>psychological</b> <b>disturbance</b> and change. The A-B-C model states that it is not an A, adversity (or activating event) that cause disturbed and dysfunctional emotional and behavioral Cs, consequences, but also what people B, irrationally believe about the A, adversity. A, adversity can be an external situation, or a thought, a feeling or other kind of internal event, and it can refer to an event in the past, present, or future.|$|E

Recently published studies revealed that infertility affects about one in six couples during their lifetime and is more frequent in obese. Obesity is also associated with male infertility related to erectile dysfunction, hormonal disturbances and lower semen quality. Any of these above mentioned disorder is the important risk factor of <b>psychological</b> <b>disturbances</b> and poor quality of life among women and men in the reproductive age.

40|$|In {{previous}} research {{it was found}} that patients with diabetes mellitus suffer from multiple physical symptoms even early in their disease course. Such complaints may relate to blood glucose levels or can be understood as a sign of distress in respect to the diagnosis of a chronic disease. PURPOSE: This study was performed to evaluate in a cross-sectional analysis all the symptoms that patients may complain of and to relate these symptoms to a possible dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. METHOD: We assessed the complaints of 66 patients with diabetes mellitus and compared these variables with those of patients with <b>psychological</b> <b>disturbances</b> (n = 794) or somatic disease (n = 162). The symptoms were recorded by means of several questionnaires such as the "Giessener Beschwerdebogen" (GBB), "the Freiburger Persönlichkeitsinventar" (FPI), the German version of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the German version of the State Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI). The autonomic nervous system was assessed using resting and mental stress conditions in a subset of patients with diabetes mellitus (n = 29) and <b>psychological</b> <b>disturbances</b> (n = 44). RESULTS: Patients suffering from diabetes mellitus and <b>psychological</b> <b>disturbances</b> showed a tendency to higher scores in GBB, STAI and STAXI. As far as <b>psychological</b> <b>disturbances</b> are concerned, the complaints experienced by patients with diabetes mellitus were found to be similar to those with somatic diseases. Both groups, however, rate clearly below those with <b>psychological</b> <b>disturbances.</b> The results of autonomic testing showed a significant disturbance in patients with diabetes mellitus with reduced sensitivity of the baroreceptor indicating autonomic neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Some of the physical complaints of patients with diabetes mellitus can be understood in connection with autonomic dysfunction. Moreover, an explicitly psychological view of these complaints may not be correct...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} {{signs and}} symptoms that should alert clinicians {{to the need for}} additional psychological assessment in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 229 consecutive patients with CLBP who attended an outpatient rehabilitation center were assessed by psychologists and physical therapists before their treatment started. The {{signs and symptoms}} assessed by the physical therapists were compared with the assessments made by the psychologists, which were considered to be the reference standard (relevant <b>psychological</b> <b>disturbances,</b> yes or no). Univariable and multivariable regression methods were applied to investigate which signs and symptoms were associated with the reference standard. A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to assess the overall accuracy of the final model. Results: The psychologists classified 53 % of the patients as having relevant <b>psychological</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Univariable analysis revealed statistically significant differences (P< 0. 05) between the 2 patient groups (relevant <b>psychological</b> <b>disturbances,</b> yes or no) for 10 of the 17 signs and symptoms. Multivariate analysis yielded a screening instrument consisting of the following 4 signs and symptoms: presence of Waddell signs, elevated scores on the pain drawing, absence of a directional preference, and daily use of analgesic medication for CLBP [area under the ROC curve, 0. 81 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 75, 0. 87) ]. Discussion: This study established a clinically useful screening instrument for the identification of patients with CLBP who might benefit from additional psychological assessment in an outpatient rehabilitation setting. Further research is needed to confirm our preliminary results. Copyright © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R
