40|$|In Vietnam, as in {{many other}} rapidly-developing {{countries}} in Southeast Asia, industrial estates have sprung up to provide the infrastructure that factories need. Such estates can reduce the environmental impact of the industries they support, by providing central wastewater <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> <b>facilities.</b> Since there are economies of scale in wastewater treatment, sharing common facilities should reduce costs. Unfortunately, wastewater treatment is often not practised and Vietnam is currently experiencing a lot of water pollution from the factories in its industrial zones. Now a new report has highlighted why many industrial estates in Vietnam have not invested in wastewater treatment plants and why many companies still fall far short of the necessary compliance. It finds that fines for polluters are ineffective and that factors such as a lack of investment capital, and a perception that the fees charged for waste treatment are unfair, are stopping many firms from investing in wastewater treatment. It makes a number of recommendations on how this situation can be improved. These include tightening pollution monitoring and assessment and imposing stricter legislative controls and stiffer penalties to deter polluters. water pollution, Vietnam...|$|R

The Agawam River begins at Halfway Pond in Plymouth and flows downstream into the Wareham River estuary into Buzzards Bay. The Agawam River is a notable contributor of freshwater and nutrients to the Wareham River estuary. The Agawam River is notable also, because it receives discharges from the Wareham Water <b>Pollution</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Facility.</b> Land use surrounding the Agawam River includes less residential land than parts of the Wareham River, although there are several cottage establishments at ponds of the Agawam River. New housing developments are currently being built that may impact the Agawam River. Currently, there are many cranberry bogs and roads that follow the same path as the Agawam River. There are schools, businesses, and the Water <b>Pollution</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Facility.</b> Historically, the river welcomed along its banks, grist mills, nail mills, cotton and fulling mills, farmland, some settlements and many people who fished its abundant waters. Our study included two sites; upstream-the off Glen Charlie site, and downstream-the Minot Avenue site. In developing our study question, we wondered if the changes in seasons affected water quality {{and if there was}} an impact on the herring running upstream to Halfway Pond in the spring to spawn. We thought about leaves falling from the trees in the fall, road salt from the winter, melting ice in the spring, and fertilizer run-off. We wondered if we would find detrimental impacts from the river to the aquatic, animal and bird habitats at the river. We also discussed several contributing considerations in our study, such as; our study sites were upstream of the Water <b>Pollution</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Facility,</b> the effects of the tide, and brackish water. We intended to study Nitrogen, Phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, river velocity and macroinvertebrates. Inability, at the time, to test salt water resulted in Nitrogen as being below detection level. We found higher levels of Phosphorus in the Minot Avenue site and in the Glen Charlie site in the Fall, but more in the Minot Avenue. Our early Spring samples had lower levels of Phosphorus than our late Spring samples. Our discussion about these findings is that we believe Phosphorus levels were higher in the Fall because of the flooding of cranberry bogs that is done in the Fall after harvesting. The higher Phosphorus findings in the late Spring could be possible fertilizer run-off. In studying river velocity, we were able to calculate discharge per day and Phosphorus load. The following is discharge per day, which is not in our Presentation: Minot Ave. November: 2, 812, 320 cf/ 24 hours March: 2, 416, 608 cf/ 24 hours Off Glen Charlie November: 971, 136 cf/ 24 hours March: 1, 219, 795 cf/ 24 hours It is possible that flow was more abundant at Off Glen Charlie in March because the water fall upstream was opened; in November, it was closed.

VTG is a yolk-precursor protein synthesizedby the liver of egg-laying females after the stimuli ofestrogen.

40|$|Biogas is {{becoming}} an increasingly popular product from the treatment of wastewater, agriculture, food, and municipal solid waste. The process of anaerobic digestion (AD) allows organic waste streams such as sewage sludge, manure, and landfill organics to be converted into usable products such as biogas, fertilizer, and soil amendments. The benefits of resource recovery from waste streams depend on the current economic context and establishing a defined market for value-added products. However, {{there is a significant}} challenge in evaluating these opportunities without first understanding the environmental impact associated with various AD resource recovery systems. Applying life cycle assessment (LCA) to commercial biogas production provides a valuable tool for evaluating the environmental impact of waste management processes and assists in economic decision-making.
