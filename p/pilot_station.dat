5|$|In 1825, Brisbane was {{established}} as a penal settlement. In spite of the hazards, the preferred access to Moreton Bay and Brisbane was through the southern entrance, between Moreton Island and North Stradbroke Island, mainly due to shorter shipping route and better shipping conditions. The southern entrance was therefore marked in 1825 and a <b>pilot</b> <b>station</b> {{was established}} at Amity Point on North Stradbroke Island in 1827. Although the northern entrance was considered in the 1830s, it was only with the increased shipping activity due to proclamation of Moreton Bay as a free settlement in 1842 that vessels began to use the northern entrance. Buoys marking the entrance were laid in 1846–1847, and in 1848 the <b>Pilot</b> <b>Station</b> was moved to Bulwer on Moreton island. By then the northern entry was regarded as the main entry.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pilot</b> <b>station</b> at Reposaari {{observed}} {{the struggle of}} the ship in the waters between Outoori and the Säppi lighthouse. The high waves made the ship roll violently until a breaker rolled over the ship. The <b>pilot</b> <b>station</b> saw the ship {{for a short while}} (when it probably had rolled over) but it disappeared from view at 1.25 pm. Later the pilots learned that it had been the torpedo boat S2 that they had observed. The torpedo boat's crew of 53 were lost in the disaster.|$|E

25|$|In 1874, a customs {{house and}} <b>pilot</b> <b>station</b> were built at Pouto. A signal mast was erected in the sandhills at North Head in 1876, 5–6 {{miles west of}} the station. The {{following}} year, a telegraph system was set up between the two. A lighthouse was built at North Head in 1884. The customs office was shifted to Te Kopuru in 1903. The lighthouse was automated in 1947, and closed in the mid 1950s. The structure still exists and was renovated in 1982-84.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} of the colony of Queensland from New South Wale took place with the signing of Letters Patent by Queen Victoria in 1859. The need for pilot assistance accessing the mouth of Fitzroy River and the Port of Rockhampton necessitates {{the construction of a}} <b>pilot</b> <b>station</b> on Curtis Island. The first permanent station was established on Cape Capricorn as early as 1861. Though it was moved to Grassy Hill three years later, the need for a lighthouse at Cape Capricorn remained a priority.|$|E
25|$|Initially the VTS also {{housed a}} remove <b>pilot</b> <b>station,</b> {{allowing}} for the remote guidance of vessels from Kvitsøy. This {{was carried out by}} {{at least one of the}} traffic controllers being a certified pilot. The goal of the project was to cost and overtime and better use of resources. The trial was carried out for access to Norsk Hydro Karmøy, to Ryfylke and Dusavik in Stavanger. A 2005 report concluded that the remote piloting service was not able to cut costs or improve safety and was subsequently abolished.|$|E
50|$|The mount on the AH-64 uses {{secondary}} hydraulics to {{move the}} gun. Elevation is provided via a single hydraulic actuator located on the gun's centerline just forward of the pivot point. The gun is spring-loaded to return to its centerline stowed position with the barrel angled up about eleven degrees {{in the event of}} a loss of hydraulic power. This allows the gun, which is mounted below the copilot station, to collapse cleanly into its designed space between the <b>pilot</b> <b>stations</b> {{in the event of a}} hard landing. This prevents the gun from entering the <b>pilots</b> <b>stations</b> and becoming a hazard.|$|R

25|$|The <b>pilot</b> <b>station</b> is {{integrated}} into the VTS. It covers the busiest area in Norway, with about 9,000 annual missions, or {{twenty percent of the}} national figures. There are eleven pilots working out of the station. These work 12 hours a day, with every other week off. The station has two pilot boats and eleven skippers for these. The skippers work 12 hour shifts one week at a time. Both pilots and skippers are often from off-island and therefore the boathouse has been equipped with living accommodation. The dormitory is also often used by pilots {{from other parts of the}} country which are in transit after ending of previous mission.|$|E
25|$|European {{settlement}} {{began in}} earnest after the abandonment of the Redcliffe settlement, and work began on the new convict settlement several miles up the Brisbane River in 1825. Within a couple years this new settlement was growing rapidly {{and the number of}} ships entering the bay was increasing. As a result, the facilities required to service the <b>pilot</b> <b>station</b> at Amity grew, and in 1827 convicts were sent to the island to build a new causeway at Dunwich, remnants of which can still be found on the same site. Within a year the first permanent European settlement at Dunwich had been built. Due to poor weather, smuggling, and conflict with aborigines this convict out-station was difficult to sustain and was closed in 1831.|$|E
25|$|Aboriginal peoples were {{a source}} of labour for various {{institutions}} and enterprises {{from the time of}} the first <b>pilot</b> <b>station.</b> Conflict with Europeans intensified during the middle part of the 19th century, leading to significant numbers of Aboriginal people being killed (including at the hands of the native police). Despite these conflicts other Aboriginal people were able to evade intense contact due to the lack of European activity on the bay islands. From the 1830s to 1865 there remained virtual exclusive Aboriginal possession of most of Quandamooka. However trade and social interaction with the mainland groups gradually diminished due to the outward march of pastoral settlement on the mainland. This resulted in irreparable damage to indigenous social networks and patterns of group intermarriage, as well as joint ceremonial activities.|$|E
50|$|The Lewes Coast Guard Station now {{functions}} as the Delaware River <b>pilot's</b> <b>station.</b> The station is a 2-1/2 story balloon-framed building, built in 1938 in Colonial Revival style.

25|$|After the harbour pilot {{had left}} the ship the {{combination}} turned southwest and headed towards the Kvarken in heavy head seas. To prevent water splashing over the forecastle and wetting the cargo only one main engine was running and the ship made headway at only four knots. When Finn-Baltic passed the Ulkokalla lighthouse, the second main engine was turned on to improve the maneuverability of the vessel, increasing its speed to around six knots. However, this also increased {{the amount of water}} entering the cargo hold every time the bow slammed to a wave and the watch officer, who used searchlights to monitor the state of the cargo, noticed that more ore heaps had collapsed. Later in the evening the combination passed the lighthouse and <b>pilot</b> <b>station</b> of Tankar, and the wind seemed to calm down.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, 298 {{acres at}} False Cape was {{acquired}} formally by the Australian Government, anticipating that a coastal defence facility might be maintained here after the war. This area comprised the 250 acres formerly declared a Reserve for <b>Pilot</b> <b>Station</b> by the Queensland Government, {{part of a}} recreation reserve {{to the south of}} this, and about 12 acres of the Yarrabah reserve, gazetted a Reserve for the Aboriginal Inhabitants of the Colony in 1892, and extended to include this area in 1935. However, in 1947 the land was declared surplus to army requirements, and leased to private enterprise, including a tourist operator in the 1950s. No tourist facilities eventuated, but in the post-war year Sunny Bay and False Cape once again became popular as a recreational venue. A number of small weekend/fishermen's shacks were erected in the area, and the remains of a more substantial, stone-walled s or 1960s weekender survive on the beach at Sunny Bay. Title to the site was transferred from the Australian Government to private ownership in 1969.|$|E
25|$|In May 1966 the Australian Government, {{responding}} to {{the changing nature of}} international shipping, granted permission for the Queensland Government to construct a composite structure comprising lighthouse, signal station and radar station, on the lighthouse reserve at Caloundra Head. The new structure was part of a <b>pilot</b> <b>station</b> scheme based at the Mooloolah River, and was to serve as a guide to the North West Channel and a signal light for Caloundra Harbour. Fully completed and operational by 1968, the new lighthouse was erected close to the 1896 lighthouse and for a time the two towers stood side by side. Constructed in reinforced concrete, the new lighthouse resembled an airport control tower. A new light that used a revolving table and comprised two stacks of sealed beam lamps was designed and installed. It was manned 24 hours a day and four houses were built outside the reserve to accommodate the staff and their families. A similar signal station tower was constructed at Lytton Hill, making the Caloundra tower one of only two of this type built in Australia. With the Lytton Hill tower being demolished in the 1990s, the Caloundra tower remains the only surviving example.|$|E
