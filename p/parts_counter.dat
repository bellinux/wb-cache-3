Engines prepared for competition use were capable of producing [...] with little more than the 8-Bbl induction, ported heads with higher pressure valvesprings, roller rocker arms, and the '754 2nd-design road-race cam. 1967/1968 models' cowl-induction system had an enclosed air-cleaner assembly ducted from its passenger side into the firewall cowl above the heater core. In 1969, factory Z/28's could be ordered with the ZL-1 aluminum-block 427 adaption of the 1967 L-88 427 Corvette cowl-induction 'ZL-2' hood available for both single and dual four-barrel induction systems that were sealed to the air cleaner base ensuring dense cooler, high-pressure, oxygen-laiden air from the center of the base of the windshield was supplied to the engine for combustion smoothness and maximum power production. Another popular service-parts-only component used on the 302 was the magnetic-pulse Delco transistor-ignition ball-bearing distributor. Introduced in 1963 on Pontiac's 389 and 421 drag racing engines, General Motors fitted it to the 1966? Z/28 before they used it on the L88 [...] Corvette. It eliminated the production breaker-point ignition allowing greater spark energy and more stable ignition timing at all engine speeds including idle. This was one of the least talked about yet most transformative and comprehensive performance and durability upgrades of its time. Many of the 302s off-road service parts were the development work of racers like Roger Penske. Every part in a SCCA Trans-Am engine had to be available through local Chevrolet parts departments to encourage their use by anyone who wanted them.|$|E
40|$|Local area {{networks}} (LANs) provide {{links between}} computing devices, such as workstations, file servers, and printers, over {{a relatively small}} geographic area (usually within a single building or organization). While computer networks have existed for almost thirty years, networking technology has only recently become available to small organizations. In the late 19802 ̆ 7 s the use of LANs has begun to mushroom, and presumably has begun to affect the organizations which use LANs. ^ A {{review of the literature}} reveals many technical and product-oriented articles about LANs, but no previous research into the organizational effects of LANs. However, a strong tradition of studying the effects of technology on social structures exists. This dissertation describes a study which builds from this tradition. ^ The research described herein is an exploratory study of the effects of LANs on a small business environment. The particular environment chosen, the auto parts industry, is representative of many inventory-intensive, transaction-oriented small businesses. Forty-six respondents, all auto parts retailers, were asked about their reasons for acquiring their LANs and about their level of satisfaction with their LANs. Growth trends, employment trends, and regional differences in LAN usage were also studied. In brief, the major findings of the research are the following:^ Acquisition and satisfaction. (1) Three clusters of factors stand out among the reasons why auto parts firms have made the investment in networking technology: financial controls, managerial controls, and external factors impinging on the firm. The financial controls cluster is the most important. (2) A high level of satisfaction with computer networks exists in the auto parts user community. (3) The reasons for the high level of user satisfaction reported in Finding 2 were examined. Users report being most satisfied with financial objectives, followed closely by managerial objectives. As a group they are less satisfied with external objectives. ^ Growth. (4) Auto parts companies which have purchased computer networks have shown significant growth, as reflected in increases in the total number of employees since the purchase. (5) Auto parts companies which have purchased computer networks have not experienced significant changes in the number of office employees since the purchase. ^ Employment trends. (6) In the auto parts industry, the use of unskilled, or lesser-skilled, employees on the auto <b>parts</b> <b>counter</b> is increasing and is likely to continue to increase. (7) In the auto parts industry, the number of women in non-traditional positions (such as working on the <b>parts</b> <b>counter</b> or in management) has increased in the last decade. ^ Regional differences. (8) The proportion of stores in the metropolitan Boston area which have computer networks is significantly lower than the proportion in all other areas contacted during the interview process. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} selected scoring techniques of eighteen mainstream wind-band composers from John Philip Sousa to the present. The men were surveys conducted from 1950 through 1985. A master list of 576 wind-band composers was reduced to eighteen, following the criterion of three hundred or more recommendations of their individual works and a limitation that each composer had written at least three original wind-band compositions to qualify as an influential mainstream composer of that genre. selected by a synthesized preferential list of twenty-fiveData were gathered upon a comparative measurement of time, dividing each composition into the smallest common each instrument part in melodic, countermelodic, harmonic, bass-line, doubling, dynamics and solo material. Each composer was introduced in a brief biography, and the formal structure of his work was overviewed, followed by a review of the work as scored. Detailed analysis was made of score instrumentation, individual instrument usage, ranges anddenominator to determine performance percentages, assessing tessituras, choir and family grouping and voice usage, score density and texture, doubling practices and scoring of expression marks. Individual composition and comparative summaries were made. General conclusions drawn from the study were: (1) Compositions within three groupings, March King, English tradition, and American school band composers contains scoring similarities. American professional compositions differed among themselves and from the first three groupings. (2) Professional march composers scored heavily doubled melodies, parallel harmonic <b>parts,</b> <b>counter</b> melodies, vertical accompaniment parts and bass lines contrasted by high-low voices and woodwind-brass voices. Powerful middle ranges and tessituras with upper woodwinds produce brightness to the woodwind sonority. Accented passages were contrasted for relief from traditional loud block dynamic levels. (3) English tradition composers scored a more mellow sound against bright timbred trumpets and trombones. Modal melodies were scored in vertical and horizontal harmonies, with light voice densities. (4) American school band composers featured the clarinet section, with supporting, contrasting brasses. Scoring in middle ranges, cross-cueing with heavy doubling, thick voice densities and loud volume markings are abundant. (5) American professional tradition composers wrote in fragmented melodies over ostinatic patterns. Dissonance is contrasted with high/low tonal registers. Novel instrument combinations produce interesting timbres. Instrument parts become soloistic and orchestral. Ranges and tessituras are wider and contemporary special effects are used effectively. Representative works from different eras of wind-band composition provide great variety. Thesis (D. A. ...|$|E
