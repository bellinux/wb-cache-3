50|$|During {{the celebration}} of Bhume Naach young boys and girls are {{selected}} by {{the leader of the}} village and sent to a hill or mountain to collect water, soil, and a colorful assortment of flowers deemed holy by the villagers. The boys carry colorful flags and a <b>patho</b> (baby goat/kid); the girls carry holy water and assorted food. After collecting water, soil and flowers, three flags are attached to a huge timber to fly on the mountaintop.

The <b>patho</b> is sacrificed at the river, its blood is smeared onto colorful pieces of cloths which are attached on a tall pole and left to flutter on a rock. Afterwards, the villagers cook a variety of food, provide various drinks, eat together, and exchange gifts while wishing each other well. After this event, they gather at the main ground where they perform Balpuja. This is a ritual where a circle of people is formed and the crowd sings a song. Every member of the village is required to participate.|$|E

The Austrian participation with cars was small, from Germany had been come the mountain specialists Bobby Kohlrausch with his 750-cc-supercharged-MG, Rudolf Steinweg and Walter Bäumer. The very opposite situation with the motorcycle racer: there the Austrians placed the bulk with the mountain-experienced Martin Schneeweiss, Michael Gayer, Hermann Deimel and Otto Steinfellner leading the team, while only a few foreigners had entered for the motor cycle competition. From Switzerland had come the two NSU specialists Hans Stärkle {{with his wife in}} the sidecar and Hans Kaufmann, from Italy Radames Bianchi, from Hungary Gyula <b>Patho</b> and from Germany Schnitzelbaumer from Munich.

However, its (<b>patho)</b> physiological roles and its architecture are more complex than initially anticipated. Novel RAAS components that may add to our understanding have been discovered in recent years. In particular, the human homologue of ACE (ACE 2) has added a higher level of complexity to the RAAS. In a short period of time, ACE 2 has been cloned, purified, knocked-out, knocked-in; inhibitors have been developed; its 3 D structure determined; and new functions have been identified. ACE 2 is now implicated in cardiovascular and renal (<b>patho)</b> physiology, diabetes, pregnancy, lung disease and, remarkably, ACE 2 serves as a receptor for SARS and NL 63 coronaviruses.
