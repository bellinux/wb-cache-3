50|$|The most {{abundant}} are carbonatites with <b>granular</b> <b>texture,</b> while porphyric and trachytoid carbonatites {{are much less}} abundant. Porphyric carbonatite are formed by fast cooling of semi-crystallized magma, or in contact with cool environment. The primary crystallized and fast crystallized calcites form phenocrysts and fine-grained groundmass, respectively. The slower cooled magma obtained <b>granular</b> <b>texture.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{perform a}} novel {{analysis}} of the <b>granular</b> <b>texture</b> of a <b>granular</b> bed close to stability limit. Our analysis {{is based on a}} unique criterion of friction mobilisation in a simulated two-dimensional packing. In this way, we recover the bimodal character of <b>granular</b> <b>texture,</b> and the coexistence of weak and strong phases in the sense of distinct contacts populations. Moreover, we show the existence of a well-defined subset of contacts within the weak contact network. These contacts are characterized by their important friction, and form a highly coherent population in terms of fabric. They play an antagonistic role with respect to force chains. We are thus able to discriminate between incoherent contacts and coherent contacts in the weak phase, and to specify the role that the latter plays in the destabilisation process.

25|$|To {{prepare a}} pectin-gel, the {{ingredients}} are heated, dissolving the pectin. Upon cooling below gelling temperature, a gel starts to form. If gel formation is too strong, syneresis or a <b>granular</b> <b>texture</b> are the result, whilst weak gelling leads to excessively soft gels. Pectins gel according to specific parameters, such as sugar, pH and bivalent salts (especially Ca2+).|$|R
5000|$|L. cinerascens is {{very similar}} to L. occidentalis with more antenna {{segments}} but shorter overall antenna length. It can be distinguished from L. exotica by its shorter antennae and uropods, as well as its uniformay gray color and <b>granular</b> <b>texture.</b> The species name cinerascens comes from the Latin for [...] "ashy," [...] referring to the gray color of this species.|$|R
40|$|A new 3 D-microscopy method, focused ion beam-nanotomo-graphy (FIB-nt), {{has been}} applied to the {{statistical}} particle shape analysis and for topological characterization of <b>granular</b> <b>textures</b> in cement samples. Because of its high resolution (15 nm), FIB-nt reveals precise microstructural information at the submicrometer scale, which cannot be obtained with convention-al tomography methods. It is demonstrated that even from com-plex <b>granular</b> <b>textures</b> with dense agglomerates, it is possible to identify the individual sub-grains. This is the basis for reliable statistical shape analysis. For this purpose, moments of inertia were determined for particles from five different grain size frac-tions of a given cement, which provides important input data for future modeling of rheology and hydration processes. In addi-tion, FIB-nt was used for topological characterization of the particle–particle interfaces in the dense and fine-grained gran-ular textures. The unique 3 D-data obtained with FIB-nt thus open new possibilities for quantitative microstructure analysis and the data can be used as structural input for object-oriented modeling. I...|$|R

Prior to such processes, images were printed in books and periodicals by means of hand-engraved metal plates or wood blocks, or from drawings made on lithographic stones.

40|$|The {{anatomy and}} {{microstructure}} {{of the spine}} {{and in particular the}} intervertebral disc are intimately linked to how they operate in vivo and how they distribute loads to the adjacent musculature and bony anatomy. The degeneration of the intervertebral discs may be characterised by a loss of hydration, loss of disc height, a <b>granular</b> <b>texture</b> and the presence of annular lesions. As such, degeneration of the intervertebral discs compromises the mechanical integrity of their components and results in adaption and modification in the mechanical means by which loads are distributed between adjacent spinal motion segments...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} dynamic {{crystallization}} experiments {{has been conducted}} with several chondrule compositions. The results obtained have demonstrated that the many heterogeneous nuclei control chondrule textures. The presence of a few nuclei thus leads to barred and radiating textures from melts at or above liquidus; several nuclei just below liquidus result in microporphyritic textures; and spherules cooled faster than 2000 C/hr develop more spherulitic or acicular crystals than those of typical chondrules. The dominance of <b>granular</b> <b>textures</b> in Mg-rich olivine chondrules, porphyritic textures in Fe-rich olivine chondrules, and radiating textures in Si-rich chondrules, indicates a common limit to the initial temperature...|$|R
50|$|Grana {{originally}} {{referred to}} a class of hard, mature cheeses from Italy which have a <b>granular</b> <b>texture</b> and are often used for grating. These cheeses are typically made {{in the form of}} large drums. The structure is often described as crystalline, and the drums are divided by being split with a fairly blunt triangular knife designed for the purpose, rather than being sliced, cut or sawn. Within the European Union, the term Grana is now legally protected by Grana Padano Protected Designation of Origin, such that only Grana Padano may be sold using the term in EU countries.|$|R

The intactness of the magnetite-sulfide chondrules and nodules implies that oxidation of CK metal occurred before agglomeration.
