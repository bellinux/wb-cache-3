50|$|Systems with {{earthing}} {{through high}} resistance have low phase-to-ground fault currents so require high sensitivity of FI. In insulated neutral systems and systems with earthing through a <b>Petersen</b> <b>Coil,</b> ground faults cannot be located with classical FI's at all. Capacitive current appears in overall faulted system so directional fault location devices are required. Some modern network protection systems e.g. GFN {{have time to}} clear a fault as small as possible down to 60ms so fault indicators must not only be highly sensitive and directional but additionally very fast.|$|E
50|$|Of {{particular}} interest {{was the possibility}} of damaging Germany's electricity distribution network by shorting out high-voltage overhead power lines with thin wires dragged by balloons. Again, the results of investigations were favourable: trials showed that even a thin steel wire, much thinner than that used to tether the static barrage balloons, when drawn in sliding contact across two or more phases, could cause an arc as long as 15 ft and that arc would be maintained until the circuit breaker opened. In some cases, the arc's heat could melt the aluminum outer layers and then the reinforcing steel centre strands of the conductors. Even if the cable was not severed, the conductors would be weakened {{so that they would}} be susceptible to breaking due to increased electrical demands or normal weather events such as wind, snow and ice. Investigations revealed that it was common practise in pre-war Germany to use a <b>Petersen</b> <b>coil</b> as protection against earthing; this design was effective against a short between a high voltage cable and earth but relatively vulnerable to a short between different phases. A short between phases could result in damage, not just to a cable, but to transformers and the circuit breakers themselves. The Admiralty ran trials using surplus spherical latex meteorological balloons about 8 ft in diameter when inflated. Calculations based on the trials predicted that there would be between a 10% to 75% chance of a balloon's wire coming into contact with a high-voltage overhead line during a 30 mi transit along the ground.|$|E

The faulted feeder {{selection and}} fault identification under {{the condition of}} single-phase earth fault in the neutral un-effectual grounded system (NUGS) {{has long been a}} problem. As a matter of fact, existing methods that have been proposed may face some difficulty in the case of some scenarios, as the impact of the <b>Petersen</b> <b>coil</b> must be taken into consideration, or when the accurate location of the faulted point is required and the zero-sequence current cannot be measured. To against this, a novel faulted section identification method based on the transient current distribution is put forward by means of theoretical analysis and simulation study. It is shown by the results that this methods can give accurate location of the fault by comparing the transient RMS value of the upstream and the downstream of the fault point, even though the <b>Petersen</b> <b>coil</b> is switched in...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of self-sustained sensors based on non-conventional measurement techniques. The motivation behind this topic is to help utility companies reduce their fault handling time and improve the way faults are handled. As of today, the distribution system does not have widespread surveillance and automation systems in place. The thesis therefore investigates a sensor design based on Rogowski coils (RC), with both measurement and power supply capabilities. The concept of printed-circuit-board Rogowski coils (PCB RC) and conventional RCs for current measurement is presented. A theoretical, dimensional study with respect to feasibility and output signal magnitude is then performed. On basis of this analysis, a PCB RC prototype is manufactured. For the sensor to be implemented in the resonance grounded distribution system, it must be able to measure currents of low magnitude, as the fault current is compensated by <b>Petersen</b> <b>coils.</b> The prototype is therefore tested for common distribution system current values. Due to limitations during construction and design flaws, the PCB RC performance was poor. The induced voltage error, with respect to the theoretical response was 64. 3 - 69. 1 %. As the prototype's ability to supply enough power to the sensor circuitry (demand found to be > 10 mW) proved so limited, a more thorough analysis concerning the RC is presented. Obtaining this amount of power is, theoretically possible and easier with a conventional RC. Its maximum average power supply capability was found to be 10. 4 mW during ideal conditions. Even better results can probably be obtained as well. Based on this RC, the complete sensor system is discussed. This include rectification, digitizing, integration and boosting of the RC voltage to 3 V for battery application. A survey of possible fault localization methods for resonance grounded distribution systems is presented and an implementation is suggested. Finally, the prototype is tested with short circuit currents of 30 kA amplitude. The performance was better than for the load current test, but the magnitude error was still substantial. It varied from 20 % to 40 %. However, the lab's signal integration showed that the prototype reproduced the applied current waveform accurately. The simulations, testing and analysis performed indicate that a RC can be used for both supply of power and measurements. However, a prototype should be manufactured in order to assess this thesis' theoretical results. Combined with the proposed auxiliary circuitry and implementation strategy, it can improve the utility's fault handling. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{differential}} evolution optimization of {{peak to peak}} current value, which consist of several harmonics with defined amplitudes.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{temporary}} overvoltages that build up in radial MV distribution networks following the inception of a 1 -phase-to-ground fault (1 - -to-Gr). For extended cable/overhead MV distribution networks with ungrounded neutral, in case of low resistance faults at critical stretch of overhead lines, in [1] it has been evidenced that the temporary overvoltages on healthy phases can be very large, much higher than 3 p. u. (up to 3. 5 p. u.). Fault currents can reach twice the value calculated with simplified methods, i. e. neglecting series impedances. In this paper the study is extended to MV networks with neutral grounded by both <b>Petersen</b> <b>coil</b> and compensating impedance (<b>Petersen</b> <b>coil</b> with a resistance in parallel), in normal operation and under contingency, i. e. in case of whole or partial loss of the compensating impedance. It is demonstrated {{that the presence of}} <b>Petersen</b> <b>coil,</b> stand alone or in parallel with a grounding resistance, drastically reduces the above temporary overvoltages at values not greater than 1. 7 - 1. 8 p. u. Application of simple derived formulas to the case of partial loss of the compensating neutral impedance show that overvoltages can be reduced at 1. 82. 2 p. u., also in case of MV network having very high capacitive fault current (e. g. 300 A) and long overhead lines. An ATP case study on an existing 20 kV large Enel-Distribuzione network reported in the paper confirm that the theorical predicted overvoltages are in the above mentioned range, and that the technical solutions adopted by Enel- Distribuzione [9 - 15] are able to limit in most cases the overvoltages at values not greater than 1. 85 p. u. ...|$|E

However, the magnitudes of the stable state quantities are small, and can become even smaller when taking into consideration of the compensation effect of the <b>Petersen</b> <b>coil,</b> the fault path resistance and any CT errors. As a result, the success rate for this type of faulty line selection device is very low, especially when large fault resistance and arcing fault are involved. Although there are many installations on-site, power engineers have generally lost faith in this type of device due to its low accuracy.|$|E

For any kind of grounding systems: ungrounded system, solidly and low impedance grounded and resonant grounded, we can find advantages and disadvantages. A thorough study is necessary to choose the most appropriate grounding protection system.

This paper aims at understanding the limitations of traditionally compensated networks and compares these to networks that are locally compensated. This is done through analytical calculations and PSCAD simulations that are combined with results from a project studying cables in Swedish distribution networks.

40|$|In {{medium voltage}} {{distribution}} network, a coil might {{be placed in}} the transformer neutral to compensate the zero sequence capacitance of the network. This creates a zero sequence system with very high impedance fault. In case of single phase earth fault, the consequence is a very small faulty current which allows continuous operation even in faulty condition. Several protection devices exist to indicate the fault direction using the transient signal. A new method has been developed by computation of the zero sequence active energy signal to increase the sensitivity of the device regarding the fault impedance. The energy comes from the charging of the zero sequence capacitance of the sound feeder and the imperfection of the <b>Petersen</b> <b>coil.</b> This paper describes the phenomenon behind the algorithm of direction determination and followed by the explanation of the algorithm with simulation tests and recordings from a German DSO. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the wind/PV {{grid-connected}} system (GCS) can be categorized as technical, environmental, and economic impacts. It has a vital impact for improving the voltage in the power systems; however, it has some negative effects such as interfacing and fault clearing. This paper discusses different grounding methods for fault protection of High-voltage (HV) power systems. Influences of these grounding methods for various fault characteristics on wind/PV GCSs are discussed. Simulation models are implemented in the Alternative Transient Program (ATP) version of the Electromagnetic Transient Program (EMTP). The models allow for different fault factors and grounding methods. Results are obtained to evaluate the impact of each grounding method on the 3 -phase short-circuit fault (SCF), double-line-to-ground (DLG) fault, and single-line-to-ground (SLG) fault features. Solid, resistance, and <b>Petersen</b> <b>coil</b> grounding are compared for different faults on wind/PV GCSs.

40|$|Despite of {{the careful}} {{building}} {{and maintenance of}} the electricity network, faults like short-circuit and earth-faults take place from time to time. Majority of the faults customers experience in low voltage networks are caused by the faults in the medium voltage networks. Therefore minimizing faults in medium voltage networks contributes {{to the quality of}} delivery. A way of improving the quality of delivery is to sectionalize the protection areas into smaller units with network reclosers. Reclosers include short-circuit and earth-fault protection and auto-reclosing functionalities. The best results are gained by placing the recloser so {{that the majority of the}} faults stay behind the device and the customers on the other side, so that they are not affected by the outage caused by the fault occurring behind the recloser. The quality of delivery indexes are improved by using reclosers. After the great storms in the Nordic countries the network owners started to replace over-head line networks with underground cable. The cable characteristics, however, are very different from the characteristics of an over-head line. Cabling increases the capacitive earth-fault current for it may be considered as a cylindrical capacitor. Due to this, also the reactive power generation is increased in cabled networks. Cable can be represented with a pi-section in which the series impedance consists of reactive and resistive parts. Because an underground cable has a zero sequence series impedance which is non-negligible on contrary to over-head line, cabling long feeders produces a resistive earth-fault current component. This cannot be compensated with the usage of a <b>Petersen</b> <b>coil,</b> which is used to compensate purely capacitive earth-fault current. Increase in earth-fault current may cause hazards for human safety because the earth-fault current can energize network equipment and thereby cause dangerous over-voltages. Therefore the contact voltages have to be limited also in terms of regulations. The studies regarding earth-fault current behavior were carried out with a program namely Power System simulator for Engineering. The studies show that as the cabling increases, the zero sequence resistance becomes more dominating. When using only centralized compensation the zero sequence resistance produces resistive earth-fault current, which may cause dangerous over-voltages and causes voltage drops in zero sequence network. This may lead to difficulties in detecting high impedance earth-faults. The fault detection can be contributed with the usage of distributed compensation. The best results are gained by compensating first 10 - 15 kilometers centrally and the rest locally. The distributed <b>Petersen</b> <b>coil</b> should be dimensioned according to the produced earth-fault current in order to avoid over-compensation which may lead to false relay functions. The cable zero sequence impedance, however, is not an unambiguous matter. Therefore some field tests should be performed in the future in order to achieve even better knowledge regarding these issues. /Kir 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{medium voltage}} network of Finland is {{experiencing}} {{major changes in}} the near future as the overhead lines are replaced with cables. The reason for the extensive cabling is the new suggestions for distribution network operators' quality of supply, which were set by the Ministry of Employment and the Economy. Cabling sets a number of practical and technical challenges to distribution network operators. From the technical point of view, cables generate a significant amount of reactive power and earth fault current, which were the main research interests of this thesis. The purpose of the thesis was to find an optimal way to compensate both reactive power and earth fault currents in extensively cabled networks. The thesis studied, what is the actual need for compensation and how should it be implemented optimally in a techno-economic way. The study was carried out by using PSCAD-simulation software and making calculations based on the results. The study revealed that there is a certain need for reactive power compensation. The main reason is Fingrid's fee for inputting reactive power in the main grid, which can cause major costs as the amount of cabling increases. Another reason is the power losses due to reactive power flow, which can be effectively limited with the correct selection and placement of shunt reactors. The reactive power compensation should be implemented by using centralized shunt reactors. Distributed shunt reactors {{did not appear to be}} profitable in the normal branched feeders. Instead, they should be used with over 50 ~km straight feeders. The distributed earth fault current compensation should be implemented with distributed Petersén coils. The centralized earth fault compensation should be carried out with a combination of adjustable Petersén coils and centralized shunt reactors. It is possible to use a shunt reactor for earth fault compensation if its neutral point is grounded. However, substations should always first have an adjustable <b>Petersén</b> <b>coil</b> before grounding the shunt reactors in order to keep the correct compensation degree...|$|E
40|$|Today cables replace {{overhead}} lines in distribution systems and cause higher system capacitance and higher capacative fault currents. This fault current, in the fault location, {{is limited by}} a <b>Petersén</b> <b>coil</b> and a resistance in parallel when a fault occurs in so called “high impedance grounded systems” which are commonly used in Europe. The high impedance however has the disadvantage {{that it needs to}} be adjusted to the capacitance in the system in order to optimize the limitation of the fault current. Another option is to use a solidly grounded system with a so called “Fault Current Limiter” (FCL) instead, on the outgoing terminals of the transformer feeding the system. The FCL interrupts the outgoing current on the load side of the transformer that feeds the system, in case of a fault, by forcing the current to a zero with a counter voltage. The FCL in this master thesis triggers on 1. 5 times higher current than nominal current. After fault clearing the FCL is reclosed. The FCL has the advantage that it {{does not have to be}} adapted to the capacitance in the system. It should be noted that the current in all of the phases (even the healthy phases) are interrupted downstream the FCL. It also has the ability to interrupt the single line-to-ground fault before it develops into a three phase fault. This thesis presents a comparison between the high impedance grounding and the FCL. The characteristics of the two grounding principles are investigated in a distribution system from Vattenfall. The assessment is done via simulations in the program PSCAD with three types of grounding of the transformer; high impedance grounding, solid grounding (without FCL) and solid grounding with FCL. The system is simulated with the faults “single line-to-ground” and “three phase short circuit” respectively, even if a line-to-line can occur. The results from the simulations show that the FCL gives a short fault duration time and a possibility to limit both single line-to-ground faults and three phase faults. The high impedance grounding on the other hand is able to limit single line-to-ground faults whereas it is generally known that not able to limit three phase short circuits...|$|E
