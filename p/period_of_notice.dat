25|$|Underlying Mr Barker's {{claim is}} that the Commonwealth Bank was wrong to dismiss him in breach of its policies. There are {{numerous}} difficulties facing an employee who believes they were wrongfully dismissed. At common law the employee {{had no right to}} be given a reason for the dismissal. If the employer dismissed an employee without notice, a court would scrutinise whether the employee's conduct justified summary dismissal. Even if the contract does not specify a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice,</b> a term is implied that either party could bring the contract of employment to an end by giving a reasonable <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice.</b>|$|E
25|$|Protection from {{dismissal}} was extended. The {{periods of}} notice, which are graduated {{according to the}} length of time the worker has been employed, were considerably increased. In addition, the guarantee of payment during the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> was consolidated.|$|E
25|$|Unlawful {{termination}} encompassed several parts; {{notice of}} termination, Centrelink notification, and prohibited reasons. Under Section 661 of the Act, employees, other than excluded employees (including casual employees {{with less than}} 12 months regular ongoing service, apprentices) were required {{to be given a}} specified <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> of termination or payment in lieu of this notice. Where this was not provided to an employee, an unlawful termination application could have been lodged. In certain circumstances where a business terminates 15 or more employees, the business needed to give written notice to a body prescribed by the Workplace Relations Regulations 2006, currently Centrelink.|$|E

25|$|During the 2009–10 season, it {{had become}} {{apparent}} to the club's new owner Balram Chainrai that Portsmouth were approximately £135million in debt so to protect the club from liquidation, Chainrai placed the club into administration on 26 February 2010, and the club appointed Andrew Andronikou, Peter Kubik and Michael Kiely of accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young as administrators. This automatically incurred a nine-point penalty from the Premier League which came into effect on 17 March and consigned the team to almost certain relegation, which was mathematically confirmed on 10 April 2010. On 9 April 2010, it was announced David Lampitt would be joining Portsmouth as their new CEO after he had worked a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> at the FA, his current employer.|$|E
500|$|Former Crystal Palace {{player and}} manager of Reading Alan Pardew was lined {{up to be the}} next bench boss. Reading and their chairman, John Madejski, however, were {{reluctant}} to let him leave. After serving a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> and gardening leave, and with West Ham paying Reading £380,000 in compensation, he was appointed manager on 18 October 2003, their tenth manager. Pardew set out to rebuild the side bringing in Nigel Reo-Coker, Marlon Harewood and Brian Deane. In his first season in charge, they made the playoff final only to lose to Crystal Palace. His signings of Bobby Zamora, Matthew Etherington and veterans Chris Powell and Teddy Sheringham saw West Ham finishing sixth and subsequently beat Preston North End 1–0 thanks to a Zamora goal in the 2005 playoff final, securing a return to the Premier League. After ensuring promotion, Pardew said, [...] "It's a team effort. We defended well and we're back where we belong." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} {{common law}} rule for dismissal of employees according to William Blackstone envisaged that, unless another practice was agreed, employees would be {{deemed to be}} hired for a fixed term of one year. Over the 19th century, most states in the North adhered to the rule that the period by which an employee was paid (a week, a month or a year) determined the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> that should be given before a dismissal was effective. For instance, in 1870 in Massachusetts, Tatterson v. Suffolk Mfg Co held that an employee's term of hiring dictated the default <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice.</b> By contrast, in Tennessee, a court stated in 1884 that an employer {{should be allowed to}} dismiss any worker, or any number of workers, for any reason at all. An individual, or a collective agreement, according to the general doctrine of freedom of contract could always stipulate that an employee should only be dismissed for a good reason, or a [...] "just cause," [...] or that elected employee representatives would have a say on whether a dismissal should take effect. However, the position of the typical 19th-century worker meant that this was rare.|$|E
2500|$|Promissory {{estoppel}} requires (1) an unequivocal promise by {{words or}} conduct, (2) {{a change in}} position of the promisee {{as a result of}} the promise (not necessarily to their detriment), (3) inequity if the promisor were to go back on the promise. Estoppel is [...] "a shield not a sword" [...] – it cannot be used as the basis of an action on its own. It also does not extinguish rights. In High Trees the plaintiff company was able to restore payment of full rent (although estopped back rent was lost) from early 1945, but would have been able to restore full rent at any time after the initial promise provided a suitable <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> had been given.|$|E

The Transfers of Undertakings Directive 2001 require that staff retain all contractual rights, unless there is an independent economic, technical or organisational reason, if their workplace is sold from one company to another. Last, the Insolvency Protection Directive 2008 requires that employees' wage claims are protected {{in the event that}} their employer falls insolvent. This last Directive gave rise to Francovich v Italy, where the Court of Justice affirmed that member states which fail to implement the minimum standards in EU Directives are liable to pay compensation to employees who should have rights under them.|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, {{reducing}} high {{labour turnover}} may enable workers to specialise and inherently become more productive. Possible reasons are short legal <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> and severance for workers who terminate their job by choice. The labour market reforms currently discussed in Mexico should attend {{to these two}} points. Another possibility to add value to work experience would be certified on-the-job training. While on-the-job training enhances a worker’s skills, it may also increase loyalty to the firm. In the literature review by (Bartel, 2000), a strong tendency towards high employer returns to investment in on-the-job training is shown. In Mexico, loyalty towards the employing organisation is low (Miller et al. 2001). Instead, loyalty to one’s supervisor is strong (Martinez & Woodruff, 2007), leading to a spiral of job mobility as a worker is likely to terminate his job when his supervisor leaves the firm.|$|R

30|$|The {{results provide}} policy {{immediate}} and implementable policy implications. In order to counteract rural-to-urban migration, we suggest a {{regional development plan}} involving the strategic attraction of particular large, international firms and FDI to rural areas. This brings investments in infrastructure, creates jobs and facilitates labour law compliance. Furthermore, large firms tend to pay relatively high wages {{and are more likely}} to register their workers with the IMSS, which in turn can reduce poverty and welfare dependency. In such firms, workers can accumulate work experience and become more productive for which they will then be paid accordingly. Another method of counteracting rural-to-urban migration would be to reduce labour turnover which is currently high because of informal work relationships which imply little provision of on-the-job-training, high loyalty to the supervisor rather than the employing organisation, short <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>notice,</b> low severance pay and low investments in firm-specific human capital (and the resulting loss of potential efficiency or productivity gains). Low returns to experience are likely to be the result of this high labour turnover – and need to be targeted.|$|R
