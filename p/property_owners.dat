5|$|During Fiscal Year 2009, {{the city}} {{assessed}} <b>property</b> <b>owners</b> {{a total of}} $37 million for property taxes. However, the Mayor's Office expects $1 million of this assessment to be difficult or impossible to collect. Revenues of $36 million were recognized, because {{this portion of the}} assessment was available and measurable within the current period.|$|E
5|$|Favre died in 1813, leaving many minor {{children}} and a substantial estate of more than 5000 acres of land and 57 slaves. He had 13 known children with three different women, and leaves numerous descendants. A well-known descendant is former National Football League quarterback Brett Favre. Simon Favre's associations with <b>property</b> <b>owners</b> and prominent officials demonstrate {{that he was a}} person of very high social standing.|$|E
50|$|Most notably, a <b>{{property}}</b> <b>owner</b> {{has a duty}} to warn persons on {{the property}} of various hazards, depending on the status of the person on the property. For example, the <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> must warn an anticipated or discovered trespasser of deadly conditions known to the <b>property</b> <b>owner,</b> but that would be hidden from the trespasser. The <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> must warn licensees of all known hazards (whether deadly or not), and must warn invitees of all dangers that the <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> can discover through a reasonable inspection of the property.|$|R
50|$|RMUs {{are usually}} {{supplied}} by the <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> and licensed rather than leased, with much looser language allowing the <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> to revoke operational rights overnight or relocate the unit within the center upon notice. Kiosks are also available under the same conditions and may even be {{supplied by the}} <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> when they have been abandoned by former tenants; occasionally these units are built specific to a property and supplied by the <b>property</b> <b>owner.</b>|$|R
50|$|Once {{value is}} determined, the {{assessor}} typically notifies the last known <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> {{of the value}} determination. Such notices may include the calculated amount of tax. The <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> may then contest the value. Property values are generally subject to review by a board of review or similar body, before which a <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> may contest determinations.|$|R
5|$|For {{the most}} part, slaves were treated harshly and oppressively during the Roman republican period. Under Republican law, a slave was not {{considered}} a person, but <b>property.</b> <b>Owners</b> could abuse, injure or even kill their own slaves without legal consequence. While there were many grades and types of slaves, the lowest—and most numerous—grades {{who worked in the}} fields and mines were subject to a life of hard physical labor.|$|E
5|$|Omaha had terrible streets {{through the}} late 1880s, which caused many {{residents}} to believe the city was not progressing appropriately. This lack of responsiveness by the city government was caused by <b>property</b> <b>owners</b> throughout the city {{who did not want}} to pay for improvements. On rainy days stagecoaches would sink up to their hubcaps, and residents wore knee-high boots to wade through the mud, and at times rivers ran through the streets.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, 1999, the River Oaks <b>Property</b> <b>Owners,</b> Inc. {{entered an}} {{agreement}} with the City of Houston; ROPO agreed to maintain and upgrade parks and esplanades in River Oaks. ROPO also has the right to spend its own funds to improve them. Municipal parks assisted by ROPO include Del Monte Park, Mary Elliot Park, Ella Lee Park, Homewood Park, Kirby Park, Rebecca Meyer Park, Olympia Park, Pine Valley Park, and Sleepy Hollow Park.|$|E
25|$|Photography may be {{prohibited}} or restricted by a <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> on their <b>property.</b> However, a <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> generally cannot restrict the photographing {{of the property}} by individuals who are not {{within the bounds of}} the property.|$|R
50|$|Within RadPad's app, a renter {{can reach}} out to a <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> to ask {{questions}} or set up a viewing. The platform also shows a renter when a <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> has read a message and their location.|$|R
50|$|Many jurisdictions {{within the}} United States have passed {{statutes}} to modify or clarify {{the common law}} duties owed by a <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> to a trespasser (for example, by explicitly permitting the <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> to use deadly force to expel trespassers).|$|R
5|$|Some <b>property</b> <b>owners</b> may {{qualify for}} grants as well, for {{instance}} the Save America's Treasures grants, which apply specifically to properties {{entered in the}} Register with national significance or designated as National Historic Landmarks. The Save America's Treasures office has closed. The United States Congress did not renew the funding for the program for fiscal years 2011 and 2012, and does not plan to re-establish funding.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent to the 1989 earthquake, $50,000 from {{grateful}} Marina <b>property</b> <b>owners,</b> and $300,000 from {{an anonymous}} donor {{were used to}} provide Phoenix with a colleague. Guardian, an older fireboat built in 1951, was purchased from the City of Vancouver, British Columbia, and refurbished. She was piloted down the Pacific Coast to dock alongside Phoenix at Pier 22½. In 1999, the shared fireboat house was declared San Francisco's 225th Historic Landmark.|$|E
5|$|The first {{official}} Keeper of the Register was William J. Murtagh, an architectural historian. During the Register's earliest {{years in the}} late 1960s and early 1970s, organization was lax and SHPOs were small, understaffed, and underfunded. However, funds were still being supplied for the Historic Preservation Fund to provide matching grants-in-aid to listed <b>property</b> <b>owners,</b> first for house museums and institutional buildings, but later for commercial structures as well.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{claimant}} {{is involved in}} wrongdoing {{at the time the}} alleged negligence occurred, this may extinguish or reduce the defendant's liability. The legal maxim ex turpi causa non oritur actio, Latin for [...] "no right of action arises from a despicable cause". [...] Thus, if a burglar is verbally challenged by the <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> and sustains injury when jumping from a second story window to escape apprehension, there is no cause of action against the <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> even though that injury would not have been sustained but for the <b>property</b> <b>owner's</b> intervention.|$|R

5|$|Troy's {{ordinances}} designate its Planning Commission as the Historic District and Landmarks Review Commission. <b>Property</b> <b>owners</b> in {{the district}} must get special permission from the commission for any work on their properties beside ordinary maintenance (and even for that in some cases), {{to make sure it}} leaves the historic character of the property and the surrounding buildings intact.|$|E
5|$|Early {{settlers}} and <b>property</b> <b>owners</b> {{contributed to the}} development of the city, and many families and individuals are remembered in street names. Streets laid out when Utica was a village had more irregularities than those built later in the 19th and 20thcenturies. As a result of the city's location (adjacent to the Mohawk River), many streets parallel the river, so they do not run strictly east-west or north–south. Remnants of Utica's early electric-rail systems can be seen in the West and South neighborhoods, where the rails were set into the streets.|$|E
5|$|Sparked by the 1848 Whitman Massacre, {{a number}} of violent battles were fought between American {{settlers}} and the region's natives. The subsequent Indian Wars, especially the Yakima War, decimated the native population and removed much land from native control. As years progressed, the right of natives to fish along the Columbia became the central issue of contention with the states, commercial fishers, and private <b>property</b> <b>owners.</b> The US Supreme Court upheld fishing rights in landmark cases in 1905 and 1918, {{as well as the}} 1974 case United States v. Washington, commonly called the Boldt Decision.|$|E

50|$|During an {{interview}} with Business News Network, Bordo stated that the company acts as a marketplace for Canadian rentals and Canadian residents. The focus of the site is to introduce the client to the <b>property</b> <b>owner.</b> It is then down to the individuals to vet {{to ensure that it}} is a good match. Bordo also stated in the interview that renting the property is at the discretion of the <b>property</b> <b>owner,</b> therefore if they feel they don't want to rent to an individual or for a certain period of time, there is no commitment needed from the <b>property</b> <b>owner.</b>|$|R
5|$|Spatial {{economics}} {{deal with}} distance and area, {{and how these}} may affect a market through transportation costs and geographical limitations. The development of spatial economics is usually ascribed to German economist Johann Heinrich von Thünen; however, Cantillon addressed spatial economics nearly a century earlier. Cantillon integrated his advancements in spatial economic theory into his microeconomic analysis of the market, describing how transportation costs influence the location of factories, markets and population centres—that is, individuals strive to lower transportation costs. Conclusions on spatial economics were derived from three premises: cost of raw materials of equal quality will always be higher near the capital city, due to transportation costs; transportation costs vary on transportation type (for example, water transportation was considered cheaper than land-based transportation); and larger goods that {{are more difficult to}} transport will always be cheaper closer to their area of production. For example, Cantillon believed markets were designed as they were to decrease costs to both merchants and villagers in terms of time and transportation. Similarly, Cantillon posited that the locations of cities were the result in large part of the wealth of inhabiting <b>property</b> <b>owners</b> and their ability to afford transportation costs—wealthier <b>property</b> <b>owners</b> tended to live farther from their property, because they could afford the transportation costs. In Essai, spatial economic theory was used to derive why markets occupied the geographical area they did and why costs varied across different markets.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Estate {{is one of}} {{the largest}} <b>property</b> <b>owners</b> in the United Kingdom, with {{holdings}} of £7.3billion in 2011. It is held in trust, and cannot be sold or owned by the Sovereign in a private capacity. In modern times, the profits surrendered from the Crown Estate to the Treasury have exceeded the Civil List and Grants-in-Aid. For example, the Crown Estate produced £200million in the financial year 2007–8, whereas reported parliamentary funding for the monarch was £40million during the same period.|$|E
5|$|The River Oaks <b>Property</b> <b>Owners,</b> Inc. {{offices are}} at 3923 San Felipe Road. The {{community}} operates its own private security force, River Oaks Patrol.

50|$|If a <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> {{builds a}} fence around his property, and then {{subsequently}} an adjoining <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> encloses the adjacent property, the second party must purchase {{one half of}} the fence built by the first party on the common property line. If the two parties cannot reach an agreement, a fence viewer will determine the amount to be paid. Fence viewers also inspect divisional fences in need of repair and notify the negligent party to repair the fence, and estimate the cost to be paid to the adjoining <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> to make the repairs if the negligent owner fails to comply.|$|R

Methods such as visual inspection, radiography, ultrasonic testing, phased-array ultrasonics, dye penetrant inspection, magnetic particle inspection, or industrial computed tomography can help with detection and analysis of certain defects.|$|E
5|$|The {{unpredictability of}} the show and Banksy's elusive nature stirred {{excitement}} amongst fans, while defacement from competing street artists and vandals became an imminent problem. While Banksy's works were inherently illegal, no official complaints were reported to the police; most <b>property</b> <b>owners</b> praised the art and some took measures to protect it. The month-long residency drew controversy amongst some locals for its more politically strong pieces, and received mixed reviews from critics. A documentary film covering this period titled Banksy Does New York was released in 2014.|$|E
5|$|After the riots, Bishop Kenrick {{ended his}} efforts to {{influence}} the public education system and began encouraging the creation of Catholic schools, with 17 being founded by 1860. The friars of the Church of St. Augustine sued the city of Philadelphia for not providing the church with adequate protection, claiming $80,000 in damages. The city argued that the friars could not claim their civil rights were violated, as the Order of St. Augustine was a foreign organization under the Pope. Furthermore, the city argued that the friars took a vow of poverty {{and could not be}} <b>property</b> <b>owners.</b> The Augustinians ended up proving the Order was incorporated in 1804 and was awarded $45,000. The church was rebuilt in 1848.|$|E
