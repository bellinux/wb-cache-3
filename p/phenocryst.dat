50|$|Rocks can be {{classified}} according to the nature, size and abundance of <b>phenocrysts,</b> and {{the presence or absence}} of <b>phenocrysts</b> is often noted when a rock name is determined. Aphyric is a term used to describe rocks that have no <b>phenocrysts,</b> or more commonly where the <b>phenocrysts</b> consist of less than 1% <b>phenocrysts</b> (by volume); while the adjective phyric is sometimes used instead of the term porphyritic to indicate the presence of <b>phenocrysts.</b> Porphyritic rocks are often named using mineral name modifiers, normally in decreasing order of abundance. Thus when olivine forms the primary <b>phenocrysts</b> in a basalt, the name may be refined from basalt to porphyritic olivine basalt or olivine phyric basalt. Similarly, a basalt with olivine as the dominate <b>phenocrysts,</b> but with lesser amounts of plagioclase <b>phenocrysts,</b> might be termed a olivine-plagioclase phyric basalt.|$|R

Taftan rocks overall are -rich calc-alkaline, of sub–alkaline affinity. The magma that formed these rocks was influenced by crystal fractionation and mixing processes.

2500|$|Textural {{criteria}} are less critical in classifying intrusive rocks {{where the majority}} of minerals will be {{visible to the naked eye}} or at least using a hand lens, magnifying glass or microscope. Plutonic rocks also tend to be less texturally varied and less prone to gaining structural fabrics. Textural terms can be used to differentiate different intrusive phases of large plutons, for instance porphyritic margins to large intrusive bodies, porphyry stocks and subvolcanic dikes (apophyses). Mineralogical classification is most often used to classify plutonic rocks. Chemical classifications are preferred to classify volcanic rocks, with <b>phenocryst</b> species used as a prefix, e.g. [...] "olivine-bearing picrite" [...] or [...] "orthoclase-phyric rhyolite".|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenocrysts</b> in {{the main}} andesite-dacite series include amphibole, apatite, biotite, clinopyroxene, ilmenite, magnetite, orthopyroxene, {{plagioclase}} and rarely olivine, quartz and zircon.

Cumulates of <b>phenocrysts</b> indicate their formation during the magma differentiation process.|$|R
50|$|<b>Phenocrysts</b> include olivine, {{plagioclase}} and pyroxene. Alkali basalts {{have few}} vesicles {{and a gray}} colour. Basanites contain more olivine and less plagioclase/pyroxene <b>phenocrysts.</b> No non-basaltic magmas have been erupted at Longgang.|$|R

50|$|In tholeiitic basalt, {{pyroxene}} (augite and orthopyroxene or pigeonite) and calcium-rich plagioclase {{are common}} <b>phenocryst</b> minerals. Olivine {{may also be}} a <b>phenocryst,</b> and when present, may have rims of pigeonite. The groundmass contains interstitial quartz or tridymite or cristobalite. Olivine tholeiitic basalt has augite and orthopyroxene or pigeonite with abundant olivine, but olivine may have rims of pyroxene and is unlikely to be present in the groundmass. Ocean floor basalts, erupted originally at mid-ocean ridges, are known as MORB (mid-ocean ridge basalt) and are characteristically low in incompatible elements.|$|E
50|$|Plagioclase <b>phenocrysts</b> often exhibit zoning {{with a more}} calcic core {{surrounded}} by progressively more sodic rinds. This zoning reflects the change in magma composition as crystallization progresses. In rapakivi granites, <b>phenocrysts</b> of orthoclase are enveloped within rinds of sodic plagioclase such as oligoclase. In shallow intrusives or volcanic flows <b>phenocrysts</b> which formed before eruption or shallow emplacement are {{surrounded by}} a fine-grained to glassy matrix. These volcanic <b>phenocrysts</b> often show flow banding, a parallel arrangement of lath-shaped crystals. These characteristics provide clues to the rocks' origins. Similarly, intragranular microfractures and any intergrowth among crystals provide additional clues.|$|R
40|$|Textural and {{compositional}} {{analyses of}} plagioclase <b>phenocrysts</b> in volcanic rocks have been utilized widely to decipher magmatic processes, in particular magma mixing.

This study focuses on plagioclase <b>phenocrysts</b> from two dacitic ash-flow tuffs (Qdt and Qto) exposed on the east side of Newberry Volcano. To explore possible petrogenetic relationships between the tuffs, the <b>phenocrysts</b> were characterized in terms of occurrence, morphology, disequilibrium textures, and zoning patterns. Plagioclase crystals from Qdt and Qto display similar textural attributes but differ with respect to compositional zoning types. The textural similarities suggest that the tuffs are comagmatic, but the difference in zoning patterns implies separate eruptive events. Further detailed studies of plagioclase <b>phenocrysts</b> from these ash-flow tuffs will provide greater insights int...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} is described {{for determining the}} cooling history of olivine <b>phenocrysts.</b> The {{technique is}} based on the analysis of the diffusive re-equilibration of melt inclusions trapped by olivine <b>phenocrysts</b> during crystallization. The mechanism of re-equilibration involves diffusion of Fe from and Mg into the initial volume of the inclusion. The technique applies to a single crystal, and thus the cooling history of different <b>phenocrysts</b> in a single erupted magma can be established. We show that melt inclusions in high-Fo olivine <b>phenocrysts</b> from mantle-derived magmas are typically partially re-equilibrated with their hosts at temperatures below trapping. Our analysis demonstrates that at a reasonable combination of factors such as (1) cooling interval before eruption (1000 °C), and (3) inclusion size (< 70 µm in radius), partial re-equilibration of up to 85 % occurs within 3 – 5 months, corresponding to cooling rates faster than 1 – 2 °/day. Short residence times of high-Fo <b>phenocrysts</b> suggest that if eruption does not happen within a few months after a primitive magma begins cooling and crystallization, olivines that crystallize from it are unlikely to be erupted as <b>phenocrysts.</b> This can be explained by efficient separation of olivine crystals from the melt, and their rapid incorporation into the cumulate layer of the chamber. These results also suggest that in most cases erupted high-Fo olivine <b>phenocrysts</b> retain their original composition, and thus compositions of melt inclusions in erupted high-Fo olivine <b>phenocrysts</b> do not suffer changes that cannot be reversed. Short residence times also imply that large unzoned cores of high-Fo <b>phenocrysts</b> cannot reflect diffusive re-equilibration of originally zoned <b>phenocrysts.</b> The unzoned cores are a result of fast efficient accumulation of olivines from the crystallizing magma, i. e. olivines are separated from the magma faster than melt changes its composition. Thus, the main source of high-Fo crystals in the erupted magmas is the cumulate layers of the magmatic system. In other words, olivine-phyric rocks represent mixtures of an evolved transporting magma (which forms the groundmass of the rock) with crystals that were formed during crystallization of more primitive melt(s). Unlike high-Fo olivine <b>phenocrysts,</b> the evolved magma may reside in the magmatic system for a long time. This reconciles long magma residence times estimated from the compositions of rocks with short residence times of high-Fo olivine <b>phenocrysts...</b>|$|R

The trachyandesite also comprises plagioclase and hornblende <b>phenocrysts,</b> but further includes K-feldspar <b>phenocrysts</b> showing a brown matrix. The trachydacite consists of coarse <b>phenocrysts</b> of sanidine along with plagioclase and hornblende and displays a light grey vesicular matrix.

5000|$|A <b>phenocryst</b> is {{an early}} forming, {{relatively}} large and usually conspicuous crystal distinctly larger than the grains of the rock groundmass of an igneous rock. Such rocks that have a distinct difference {{in the size of}} the crystals are called porphyries, and the adjective porphyritic is used to describe them. Phenocrysts often have euhedral forms, either due to early growth within a magma, or by post-emplacement recrystallization. Normally the term <b>phenocryst</b> is not used unless the crystals are directly observable, which is sometimes stated as greater than [...]5 millimeter in diameter. Phenocrysts below this level, but still larger than the groundmass crystals, are termed microphenocrysts. Very large phenocrysts are termed [...] megaphenocrysts.
