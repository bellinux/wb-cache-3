40|$|The {{seed bank}} {{refers to the}} resting place of weed seeds and forms an {{important}} component of the life cycle of weeds. In annual and some perennial weed species that reproduce by seed only, seed banks are the sole source of future weed populations. Because of this, understanding what happens to seeds in the seed bank can be {{an important component of}} overall weed control. When weed seeds enter the seed bank, several factors influence the duration for which seeds persist. Seeds can sense the surrounding environment in the seed bank and use these stimuli to become dormant or initiate germination. Soil and crop management practices can directly influence the environment of seeds in the seed bank and can thus be used to manage seed longevity and germination behaviour.

40|$|Innovation {{is often}} also {{viewed as the}} {{application}} of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society.

The word “innovation” is used widely and inconsistently in media and business literature.

40|$|With an {{increasingly}} competitive business environment, and more discerning customers with {{a myriad of}} needs, organisations are faced with several strategic decisions in pursuit of growth. Increased pressures from globalization which has created a no boundary global economy drives organisations {{to seek out the}} optimum growth strategies that will not only leverage on the emerging opportunities but also create sustainable competitive advantage. It thus becomes imperative for business to adopt the right strategy to address the challenges. Strategic Alliances {{is one of the many}} options open to businesses, and that is the concept being explored in this study. The objective of this study is to explore strategic alliance as a concept with a focus on how it is being exploited in the Malaysian financial industry, specifically in the banking sector to create competitive advantage. With a highly regulated financial industry in Malaysia, it will be interesting to see how both domestic and foreign banks leverage on the use of partnerships to overcome challenges and create competitive advantage. This study seeks to examine the main motives for which banks are forming strategic alliances and how critical these partnerships are for operating within Malaysia given the degree of regulation in the industry. Also to identify the forces driving the motivation to form Strategic Alliances and what types of alliances are being formed. This research conducts four bank case studies to understand the motives and alliance preference of the banks. The case studies are ground up and built on data gathered from secondary sources and from structured interviews with bank managers. This research entails the evaluation of alliance <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>types</b> of two foreign banks and two local banks, this allows for comparison to be made between the two different categories of banks based on their motives and type. The findings of this research show a major commonality in the motives of both the local and foreign banks for forming alliances. It was also observed that the foreign banks are more motivated to form alliances for the purpose of increasing their sales and distribution channels,possibly because their activities are highly regulated by government. The major force driving the motivation of banks to form alliances is the increasing pressures of having to satisfy the countless array of customers needs. Consequently all banks want to become a universal financial services provider. Evident from the study of the four banks, equity alliances are more prominent forms of collaborations between financial institutions that offer complementary services, in the bid to expand their product offerings. All four banks engage in some form of equity alliance, where the foreign banks collaborate with local financial institutions and the local banks partner with foreign financial institutions in order to access new markets. Further research may examine the criterion for selecting a strategic alliance partner, which is a very critical aspect of forming alliances. Further investigation may also be done on the factors that influence the selection of types of alliances adopted by business such as organizational culture, government intervention or employees’ culture factors...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Two key {{measures}} {{of high school}} performance in Texas public schools are performance on the exit-level Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) and performance on the SAT I and ACT. Between 1994 and 2002, TAAS scores increased substantially, whereas SAT I and ACT scores remained essentially stable. This report reviews differences between the TAAS and the SAT I and ACT examinations that contributed to differences in performance trends, namely (1) <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> of test; (2) examinee population; and (3) academic proficiency level assessed. Because of these differences, the assessments are valuable, but distinct, measures of high school performance. The gains in exit-level TAAS scores indicate that an increasing percentage of students were mastering the academic skills required to obtain {{a high school diploma}} in Texas. The essentially stable SAT I and ACT performance indicates that high school students in Texas maintained a stable level of college readiness, relative to the mean performance of the national norm groups for the SAT I and ACT...|$|R

The aim of this paper was to explore a new definition to delimit the head fire perimeter that shall be objective, unequivocal, and adequate for scientific studies. Diverse options have been explored which have came out with five different criteria that can be used when analysing fire behaviour for scientific purposes.

This paper outlines how we have used a particular ontology for this purpose over the last five years.

To assess the spatial and temporal variation of fish assemblages and their response to the hydrological changes caused by {{two different types of}} flow regulation, we selected three sampling sites in four rivers with different levels of regulation, two in a permanent river system and another two on a temporary one, which we sampled in four different annual seasons. In the permanent system, hydroelectrical regulation decreased hydrological variability, which affected fluvial specialist species, benefitting the generalist ones, and created a more homogeneous community that presented less intra-annual variation. In the temporary system, agricultural regulation caused an inversion of the hydrological cycle, maintaining a moderate flow volume throughout the drought period that benefited the introduced, generalist and more tolerant species. Monthly volume was recognized, in a temporal scale, as the most important hydrological feature for assemblages’ structure, predicting the intra-annual variation of several ecological guilds.

For this purpose we analyze a science class episode, which was recorded when a teaching sequence on heat and temperature was carried out with students aged 14 - 15 in a Brazilian secondary school. We used the framework proposed by Mortimer and Scott (2002, 2003) to make visible discursive moves that allows the students to become aware of the conflict between two models they use, in different circumstances, to interpret thermal phenomena: the kinetic particle model and a model of heat and cold exchange. Our analysis demonstrates how the teacher’s interventions guided the students to examine their own ideas through a slow and laborious meaning making process. We were able to identify changes in the teacher’s <b>purposes</b> <b>and</b> <b>type</b> of interventions as the students further developed their ideas. These changes are associated to alternations in the communicative approaches, first dialogic and then mainly authoritative.
