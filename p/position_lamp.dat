A light yellow tinted conical glass with frosted tip was chosen, as this color was determined to have the highest visibility under fog conditions based on empirical studies at Corning at that time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{ability for}} {{motorcycle}} to be detected {{is an important}} aspect in preventing crash involving motorcycle {{which is the most}} dominant vehicle in emerging countries. Widely referred as conspicuity, the crash factor is appropriately addressed by the introduction of mandatory daytime running light (DRL) law and is usually a success story {{in many parts of the}} world. In 2011, there was a motion introduced in the 64 thsession of the United Nations Working Party on Lighting and Light-Signalling (GRE) for amber <b>position</b> <b>lamp</b> (APL) to be made mandatory on motorcycle as additional measure to improve motorcycle conspicuity. An experiment was designed to evaluate conspicuity level of motorcycle headlamp and tail lamp equipped with APL over motorcycle with present DRL setting (baseline). 15 participants simultaneously rated both motorcycles which are placed in parallel, at different distances and times of day. Motorcycle with APL was noticeably better detected from rear than front at 50 meter and 100 meter distance, as well as during night time and twilight. Median conspicuity level between night time and daytime and between night time and twilight was also distinctly different for rear lamp. These findings suggest that APL introduction could enhance motorcycle conspicuity especially for rear lamp position...|$|E

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) analyses {{for the performance}} improvement of a closed-conduit ultraviolet (UV) reactor were performed by changing the <b>lamp</b> <b>positions</b> from symmetric to asymmetric. The asymmetric <b>lamp</b> <b>positioning</b> can be useful for UV reactor design and optimization. This goal was achieved by incorporating the two performance factors, namely reduction equivalent dose (RED) and system dose performance. Four cases were carried out for asymmetric <b>lamp</b> <b>positioning</b> within the UV reactor chamber and each case consisted of four UV lamps that were simulated once symmetrically and four times asymmetrically. The results of the four asymmetric cases were compared with the symmetric one. Moreover, these results were evaluated by using CFD simulations of a closed-conduit UV reactor. The fluence rate model, UVCalc 3 D was employed to validate the simulations results. The simulation results provide detailed information about the dose distribution, pathogen track modeling and RED. The RED value was increased by approximately 15 % by using UVCalc 3 D fluence rate model. Additionally, the asymmetric <b>lamp</b> <b>positioning</b> of the UV lamps had more than 50 % of the pathogens received a better and a higher UV dose than in the symmetric case. Consequently, the system dose performance was improved by asymmetric <b>lamp</b> <b>positioning.</b> It was concluded that the performance parameters (higher RED and system dose performance) were improved by using asymmetric <b>lamp</b> <b>positioning...</b>|$|R

Rear fog lamps are not required equipment in the U.S., but they are permitted, and are found almost exclusively on European-brand vehicles in North America. Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes, MINI, Land Rover, Porsche, Saab and Volvo provide functional rear fog lights on their North American models. Some vehicles from non-European brands which are adaptions of European-market offerings, such as the first generation Ford Transit Connect, come standard with rear fog lights, or vehicles with European market counterparts, such as the second generation Chrysler 300, have an option for them.

The process presented in this document has the intention of reducing the number of tasks needed to produce the final subsystem/product. To achieve this goal were combined several technologies, as in-mould assembling, laser welding and LEDs (light-emitting diode). One of the advantages of this process was the utilization of only one injection molding machine with three injection units to do all the assembling process.
