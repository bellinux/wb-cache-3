Dear Abby author Abigail Van Buren researched the poem's history and concluded in 1998 that Mary Elizabeth Frye, who was living in Baltimore at the time, had written the poem in 1932. According to Van Buren's research, Frye had never written any poetry, but the plight of a German Jewish woman, Margaret Schwarzkopf, who was staying with her and her husband, had inspired the poem. Margaret Schwarzkopf was concerned about her mother, who was ill in Germany, {{but she had been}} warned not to return home because of increasing unrest. When her mother died, the heartbroken young woman told Frye that she never had the chance to [...] "stand by my mother's grave and shed a tear". Frye, according to Van Buren's research, found herself composing a piece of verse on a brown <b>paper</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>bag.</b> Later she said that the words [...] "just came to her" [...] and expressed what she felt about life and death.|$|E

40|$|Normal <b>paper</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>bags</b> are {{manufactured}} in their 3 D shape and then folded flat for shipping and storage. Machines {{are available to}} automatically manufacture the bags. It has been found, previously by other researchers and by ourselves, the folding is possible using the conventional creases {{only because of the}} bending flexibility of the paper. Is there a crease pattern that allows the bag to fold when made from rigid material, i. e., can rigid plates be kept attached along the creases (the “geometrical compatibility conditions”) in all states during the folding process? If not, then what necessary modification to the bag’s shape is required? This paper attempts to answer these questions. It is assumed that the thickness of the bag is neglected. Furthermore, we confine ourselves to folding patterns with less then six folds meeting at any vertex. Our work starts by examining the conventional folding pattern; see Fig. 1. Because of the folds at points A and B, we can show using the loop closure equation in the theory of mechanisms that the geometrical compatibility cannot be kept during the folding process. A snap-through will be experienced during folding if the bag is made from card. Thus, other patterns need to be adopted for rigid <b>shopping</b> <b>bags.</b> Figure 2 shows a shorter bag whose height is half of that of the longer sides. We prove {{that it is possible to}} fold it by introducing diagonal folds on two larger side panels and then rotating two smaller side panels towards each other. The bag is flattened on its base, instead of on one of its larger side panels as in the conventional folding scheme. This particular folding pattern can be extended to longer bags.
