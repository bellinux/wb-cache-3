The Council of Churches became a legitimate agency of the churches through which they could work “for justice and {{what is best for}} the City of Dallas” rather than a way of mobilizing area churches to support the policies of the Dallas Citizens Council.

A third program and by far the most controversial was Block Partnership, a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> solve problems in minority neighborhoods and to improve race relations by linking them with comparatively affluent white church groups.
