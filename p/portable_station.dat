25|$|An amateur {{radio station}} {{set up in}} a {{temporary}} location is referred to as a <b>portable</b> <b>station.</b> A portable stations might be established to provide emergency communications in a disaster area, to provide public service communications during a large organized event such as a charity bicycle ride, to provide communications during an expedition, or for the recreational enjoyment of operating outdoors. Portable stations include the same basic equipment as fixed and mobile stations, although transportation of the transceiver, antennas, power supplies or batteries and necessary accessories often influences the particular selection. Equipment that does not weigh very much, or that can be broken down for shipment or transportation in luggage is especially popular with amateur radio operators travelling on DX-peditions.|$|E

50|$|Portable {{equipment}} {{indicates a}} configuration {{that allows for}} relatively rapid collection, transportation, and deployment of amateur radio gear. Licensed operators often take part in portable operations using radio equipment when traveling. A <b>portable</b> <b>station</b> can be anything from a small QRP (Low Power) radio and antenna, to a top-of-the-line rig, space dependent. On long-distance expeditions, such equipment allows them to report progress, arrivals and sometimes exchanging safety messages along the way.|$|E

50|$|The {{station was}} {{constructed}} in 1912 on the Pinnaroo railway line for the Victorian Railways. It comprises a standard, single storey, timber weatherboard, <b>portable</b> <b>station</b> building with ventilated double gable roof and an attached waiting area.

The water tower, toilet shed and store to the station platform have been demolished, while a loading ramp {{and a set of}} railway tracks have also been removed.|$|E
50|$|The parade still stirs up {{business}} for {{bars and restaurants}} in the area, especially on Varick Street. All the bars of Utica are open on the parade day by 10 o’clock. Many of them along the parade route open at 8, {{so that people can}} “start their day the Irish way.” The drinking continues throughout the day. As soon as the parade ends, anyone eligible to drink goes to Varick Street, where the police form their own <b>portable</b> <b>station</b> to keep the peace. The whole street is blocked off and the block party begins.|$|E
50|$|In 1959 the Navy {{deployed}} {{a portable}} Transit tracking {{station at the}} station, which recorded the doppler data from the 24-minute flight of the Transit 1A satellite launched on 17 September 1959. An ionospheric refraction value was calculated using the doppler data recovered by the <b>portable</b> <b>station,</b> and a correction factor was then applied to the data to produce a doppler curve unaffected by ionospheric refraction. The Satellite 1-A trajectory thus determined was {{in close agreement with}} range track data. Also in 1959 a NAVFAC was established at Argentia to operate part of the SOSUS seabed sonar system.|$|E

50|$|Cockatoo Station is {{situated}} on the Puffing Billy Railway {{in the town of}} the same name.It opened with the line on 18 December 1900 as Devon, but was renamed Cockatoo Creek on 29 July 1901 and subsequently shortened to Cockatoo in 1904. There was originally a platform road and a loop siding, but a crossing loop was later added in between the two. A single 12ft by 20 ft timber <b>portable</b> <b>station</b> building was provided which was later extended. Other associated buildings such as toilets and a van good shed were also on the platform while a weatherboard goods shed was provided on the loop siding (No. 3 Road).|$|E

50|$|The Central Highlands Tourist Railway {{was founded}} two years later, {{and set about}} {{restoring}} the railway to operating condition. After several years of restoration, trolley services commenced to a temporary terminus located in the Wombat State Forest {{in the latter half}} of the 1980s. On 15 September 1990 rail services commenced between Daylesford and the nearby hamlet of Musk. Another section of line was opened on 17 March 1997, allowing services to operate as far as Bullarto. As the station had been demolished, this required building a new platform and installing a <b>portable</b> <b>station</b> building. In 2002, the organisation changed its trading name from the Central Highlands Tourist Railway to the Daylesford Spa Country Railway.|$|E

PCS can be define as radio technology that uses Radio Frequency (RF) as a transmission medium, which {{is small and}} light, and can be implemented indoor and outdoor. One equipment that implements this technology is called D-Link. The application of D-Link is to communicate among users either indoor or outdoor.

We report on the first recalibration of TWSTFT links during a campaign involving six European time institutes. The campaign was performed using a portable ground station assembled and operated by TUG/Joanneum Research, Graz, that visited the sites of INRIM, NPL, OP, PTB, SP, and VSL, travelling a total distance over 7000 km during a three-week period in October/November 2005.

40|$|BTX (benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and p-xylene) and {{meteorological}} parameters were measured in ambient air {{of an urban}} site located in Carmen City, Campeche, Mexico. A total of 412 samples were collected for BTX and analyzed by Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID). Meteorological parameters were measured by a <b>portable</b> <b>station.</b> A marked diurnal variation was found for all measured BTX. The highest concentrations occurred during midday (13 : 00 - 14 : 30 h). A clear seasonal pattern was observed too for all compounds registering their highest levels during summer sampling period. Mean concentrations for benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and p-xylene were: 5. 42, 3. 97, 11. 24 and 8. 32 ppbv, respectively. BTX abundance showed the following order: toluene > p-xylene > benzene > ethylbenzene. BTX maximum concentrations were found when winds blowed from E and NE. Important oil industry sources and avenues are located at these directions. These sources could contribute to the levels of BTX in this site. </p...|$|E
50|$|The {{answer to}} that {{question}} was telecommunications products, primarily the satellite earth station, a large mobile dish used to receive signals transmitted from communications satellites orbiting the earth. In 1973 the company displayed a <b>portable</b> satellite earth <b>station</b> at a communications trade show in California. It planned to sell the <b>portable</b> <b>stations</b> to companies in the relatively new and rapidly growing cable television field so they could transmit their programming to a large number of stations in different areas. The stations, in turn, would send the programming to consumers' homes over their cable networks. At the time, however, observers told Scientific-Atlanta executives that satellite transmission of cable television programming would take place only in the distant future.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the reverse-link capacity performance of indoor Slotted-ALOHA protocols adapted for use with a multibeam smart antenna (SDMA) basestation. When SDMA is used in this application, the basestation attempts to transmit or receive multiple packets simultaneously using its antenna array. S-ALOHA protocols are well suited for this purpose since they permit simultaneous station transmission more readily compared with conventional LAN protocols such as CSMA. It is assumed that the <b>portable</b> <b>stations</b> have omnidirectional antennas and share a single radio link to the basestation. Versions of the protocols are considered where initial station access occurs in the data slots directly, and when both a single-beam and multibeam reservation channel is used prior to data slot access. Two slot allocation algorithms are proposed {{which can be used}} with the reservation channel protocols to dynamically assign <b>portable</b> <b>stations</b> to the data channel. It is shown that signicant improvements in system capacity are possible when more sophisticated dynamic slot allocation is employed. In the results presented, we optimize the design of each system to maximize the capacity achieved. The comparisons thus give an indication of the relative tradeos between capacity and complexity possible in such a system...|$|R
