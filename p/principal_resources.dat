60|$|The {{southern}} {{parts of}} England received their improvements directly through the channel of Rome. The kingdom of Northumberland, {{as soon as}} it was converted, began to contend with the southern provinces in an emulation of piety and learning. The ecclesiastics then [there?] also kept up and profited by their intercourse with Rome; but they found their <b>principal</b> <b>resources</b> of knowledge from another and a more extraordinary quarter. The island of Hii, or Columbkill,[46] is a small and barren rock in the Western Ocean. But in those days it was high in reputation as the site of a monastery which had acquired great renown for the rigor of its studies and the severity of its ascetic discipline. Its authority was extended over all the northern parts of Britain and Ireland; and the monks of Hii even exercised episcopal jurisdiction over all those regions. They had a considerable share both in the religious and literate institution of the Northumbrians. Another island, of still less importance, in the mouth of the Tees [Tweed?], and called Lindisfarne, was about this time sanctified by the austerities of an hermit called Cuthbert. It soon became also a very celebrated monastery. It was, from a dread of the ravages of pirates, removed first to the adjacent part of the continent, and on the same account finally to Durham. The heads of this monastery omitted nothing which could contribute to the glory of their founder and to the dignity of their house, which became, in a very short time, by their assiduous endeavors, the most considerable school perhaps in Europe.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{economic}} crisis, Europe has witnessed a spate of extraordinary political measures pressed by executive discretion.

Emergency rule will tend to blend in with normal rule, {{to the detriment of the}} political order's legitimate authority. A more dubiously grounded ‘descriptive’ authority may conversely be enhanced by emergency rule, as may compliance for instrumental motivations, producing a polity that is stable even if weakly legitimate...|$|E

HSBC Bank Canada has enjoyed considerable financial success {{over the past}} couple of decades. However, the overall direction of the industry is towards lower, interest-rate spreads and intensified competition. Many of the bank’s primary competitors are reducing costs through a variety of means, such as centralization and automation of processes. In order for HSBC Bank Canada to succeed in this increasingly challenging market, it must look at differentiating itself from the competition. It does not enjoy the same size-related advantages as the larger Canadian banks. Historically, HSBC Bank Canada used customer service as its primary differentiator. This advantage is slipping for a variety of reasons outlined in the paper. A refocus on the bank’s <b>principal</b> <b>resources</b> is recommended to ensure HSBC Bank Canada’s future remains as strong as its past...|$|E

Applications lack sufficient control over scheduling {{and management of}} machine resources, which {{makes it difficult to}} enforce priority policies, and to provide robust and controlled service.

This coincidence prevents a process that manages large numbers of network connections, for example, from properly allocating system resources among those connections.
