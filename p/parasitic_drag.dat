5|$|Three B-29s {{based on}} Guam, which had spotless mission records and no {{mechanical}} difficulties, {{were selected for}} the mission. In a ten-day process that continued as a typhoon raged off Okinawa, the aircraft were stripped of unnecessary equipment such as armor and gun turrets, and the resulting empty spaces in the fuselage were faired over with smooth metal to minimize <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag.</b> Blister-type bubble windows were replaced with flat ones, painted group markings were removed, and the aluminum aircraft skin polished to a high luster, all {{in order to achieve}} the least possible drag. Twentieth Air Force markings were painted on each vertical rudder. The bomb bay in each aircraft was fitted with five 600-gallon (2,300L) fuel tanks; added to the normal B-29 fuel tanks, this made a total of 10,000 gallons (38,000L) of fuel capacity, as much as a railroad tank car. Filled with fuel and 12 men, each ship weighed â€”it would be the greatest overload attempted on a B-29 at that time.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{position}} much {{further from the}} center of gravity, a tailwheel supports a smaller part of the aircraft's weight allowing it to be made much smaller and lighter than a nosewheel. As a result, the smaller wheel weighs less and causes less <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag.</b>|$|E
25|$|The second {{aircraft}} was modified {{from the original}} XV-1 {{in an attempt to}} reduce <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag</b> during high-speed forward flight. To achieve this end, the rotor pylon was reduced and the undercarriage was streamlined as well as strengthened. The second XV-1 also featured two small tail rotors mounted on the outboard side {{at the end of each}} tailboom. These were a result of the hover test flights by Noll who remarked on the lack of yaw authority when using rudders only. The original XV-1 would later be modified with the tail rotors.|$|E
40|$|Three {{areas are}} discussed: oscillatory {{longitudinal}} curvature, large eddy breakup devices, and small longitudinal surface striations. The first two concepts produced sizable local turbulent skin friction reductions, but {{further research is}} required to optimize the effect, reduce <b>parasitic</b> device <b>drag,</b> and provide a net increase in vehicle performance. The surface striations, due to large wetted area increased for a given planform, have not yet yielded a planform-averaged skin friction reduction. Heat transfer data indicated such surfaces may have useful application in heat exchangers...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{aerodynamic}} drag reduction for friction, wave and vortex drag associated with supersonic cruise aircraft and suggests approaches and research directions. Suction laminar flow control may also enable improved low-speed, high-lift systems, improved lift-to-drag ratio for subsonic cruise, reduced <b>parasitic</b> viscous <b>drag</b> for favorable interference wave drag reduction approaches, and turbulent skin friction reduction via slot injection. Flow separation control at cruise proffers opportunities for increased leading-edge thrust, increased lift increment from upper surface, increased fuselage lift/camber for wave drag-due-to-lift reduction, improved performance of various favorable interference wave drag reduction schemes, {{as well as}} possibly better low-speed, high-lift systems and wing cruise performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{aerodynamic}} drag reduction for friction, wave and vortex drag associated with supersonic cruise aircraft and suggests approaches and research directions which cover the spectrum from possibly significant to revolutionary. Various synergisms are also included, especially {{in regard to}} suction laminar flow control and flow separation control at cruise. The former may also enable improved low speed, high lift systems, lift to drag ratio for subsonic cruise, reduced <b>parasitic</b> viscous <b>drag</b> for favorable interference wave drag reduction approaches, and turbulent skin friction reduction via slot injection. Flow separation control at cruise proffers opportunities for increased leading edge thrust, increased lift increment from upper surface, increased fuselage lift/camber for wave drag due to lift reduction, improved performance of various favorable interference wave drag reduction schemes, as well as possibly better low speed, high-schemes and wing cruise performance. More speculative approaches include multi-stage aircraft, thrust vectoring for lift augmentation, as well as trim, {{and a number of}} conceptual wave and vortex drag reduction schemes...|$|R
25|$|It was a high-wing, strut-braced {{monoplane}} {{with the}} engine mounted pusher-fashion in a nacelle atop the wing. The cabin was semi-enclosed, featuring side windows but no roof, and was located immediately ahead of the wing. Twin tails were fitted, carrying a common stabiliser in a high position. The construction was unusual, in that rather than the flying boat hull being integral with the fuselage, the Model 23's hull was a large, separate pontoon mounted directly underneath a fuselage that was a separate structure. This was intended to combine {{the safety of a}} floatplane design with the low <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag</b> of a conventional flying boat Grover Loening was awarded the 1921 Aero Club of America Trophy for the design. The fuel tank was located under the rear passenger seat. The prototype was tested with a new roll-control mechanism to replace ailerons using a small leading edge that extended and retracted outboard of the wing tips.|$|E
25|$|During flight testing, the snag on {{the leading}} edge of the stabilators was filled in, and the gap between the leading-edge {{extensions}} (LEX) and the fuselage mostly filled in. The gaps, called the boundary layer air discharge (BLAD) slots, controlled the vortices generated by the LEX and presented clean air to the vertical stabilizers at high angles of attack, but they also generated a great deal of <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag,</b> worsening the problem of the F/A-18's inadequate range. McDonnell filled in 80% of the gap, leaving a small slot to bleed air from the engine intake. This may have contributed to early problems with fatigue cracks appearing on the vertical stabilizers due to extreme Structural loads, resulting in a short grounding in 1984 until the stabilizers were strengthened. Starting in May 1988, a small vertical fence was added to the top of each LEX to broaden the vortices and direct them away from the vertical stabilizers. This also provided a minor increase in controllability as a side effect. F/A-18s of early versions had a problem with insufficient rate of roll, exacerbated by the insufficient wing stiffness, especially with heavy underwing ordnance loads.|$|E
2500|$|The CVT2 Veltro (...) was an Italian {{competition}} glider {{built in}} the mid-1950s. Its advanced design incorporated a laminar flow wing, T-tail, retracting undercarriage and a reclining seat to reduce <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag.</b>|$|E
50|$|JATO {{stands for}} 'Jet-assisted takeoff' (and the similar RATO for 'Rocket-assisted takeoff'). In the JATO and RATO systems, {{additional}} engines are {{mounted on the}} airframe which are used only during takeoff. After that the engines are usually jettisoned, or else they just add to the <b>parasitic</b> weight and <b>drag</b> of the aircraft. However, some aircraft such as the Avro Shackleton MR.3 Phase 2, had permanently attached JATO engines. The four J-47 turbojet engines on the B-36 were not considered JATO systems; they were {{an integral part of}} the aircraft's powerplants, and were used during takeoff, climb, and cruise at altitude.|$|R
5000|$|The {{accompanying}} diagram shows a drag polar for {{a typical}} light aircraft. Such diagrams identify a minimum [...] point at the left-most point on the plot, where the drag is locally independent of lift; to the right, the drag is lift related. One component here is the induced drag of the wing, an unavoidable companion of the wing's lift, though {{one that can be}} reduced by increasing the aspect ratio. Prandtl's lifting line theoretical work shows that this increases as [...] The other <b>drag</b> mechanisms, <b>parasitic</b> and wave <b>drag,</b> have both constant components, totalling [...] say, and [...] dependent contributions that are often assumed to increase as [...] If so, then ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{interaction}} of <b>parasitic</b> and induced <b>drag</b> vs. airspeed can be plotted as a characteristic curve, illustrated here. In aviation, {{this is often}} referred to as the power curve, and is important to pilots because it shows that, below a certain airspeed, maintaining airspeed counterintuitively requires more thrust as speed decreases, rather than less. The consequences of being [...] "behind the curve" [...] in flight are important and are taught as part of pilot training. At the subsonic airspeeds where the [...] "U" [...] shape of this curve is significant, wave drag has not yet become a factor, and so it is not shown in the curve.|$|R
2500|$|Its two {{redesigned}} wing stubs are longer, {{with each}} adding a wingtip station for a missile {{such as the}} AIM-9 Sidewinder. [...] Each wing has two other stations for [...] Hydra 70 rocket pods, or AGM-114 Hellfire quad missile launchers. The Longbow radar can also be mounted on a wingtip station.

2500|$|As {{originally}} {{specified by}} Kelsey and Saville, the XP-39 had a turbo-supercharger to augment its high-altitude performance. Bell cooled the turbo with a scoop {{on the left}} side of the fuselage. Kelsey wished to shepherd the XP-39 through its early engineering teething troubles, but he was ordered to England. The XP-39 project was handed over to others, and in June 1939 the prototype was ordered by General Henry H. Arnold to be evaluated in NACA wind tunnels to find ways of increasing its speed, by reducing <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag.</b> Tests were carried out, and Bell engineers followed the recommendations of NACA and the Army to reduce drag such that the top speed was increased 16%. NACA wrote, [...] "it is imperative to enclose the supercharger within the airplane with an efficient duct system for cooling the rotor and discharging the cooling air and exhaust gases." [...] In the very tightly planned XP-39, though, there was no internal space left over for the turbo. Using a drag-buildup scheme, a number of potential areas of drag reduction were found. NACA concluded that a top speed of 429mph could be realized with the aerodynamic improvements they had developed and an uprated V-1710 with only a single-stage, single-speed supercharger.|$|E
2500|$|The B-35 was {{the brainchild}} of Jack Northrop, who made the flying wing the focus of his work during the 1930s. During World War II, Northrop had been {{commissioned}} to develop a large wing-only, long-range bomber designated XB-35. Northrop advocated a [...] "flying wing" [...] as a means of reducing <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag</b> and eliminating structural weight not directly responsible for producing lift. In theory, the B-35 could carry a greater payload faster, farther, and cheaper than a conventional bomber. On 11 April 1941, the United States Army Air Corps sent out a request for a bomber that could carry [...] of bombs to a round-trip mission of [...] Requested performance was a maximum speed of , cruise speed of , and service ceiling of [...] This aircraft would be able to bomb Nazi-occupied Europe in the event that Britain fell. (This was similar to Nazi Germany's own Amerika Bomber program design competition through RLM, itself initiated in the spring of 1942.) The original April 1941 USAAC proposal was first submitted to Boeing and Consolidated Aircraft Company and led to the production of the Convair B-36. In May the contract was also extended to include Northrop, inviting them to submit a design along the lines they were already exploring.|$|E
25|$|The {{deletion}} {{of parts}} on a vehicle {{is an easy}} way for designers and vehicle owners to reduce <b>parasitic</b> and frontal <b>drag</b> of the vehicle with little cost and effort. Deletion {{can be as simple}} as removing an aftermarket part, or part that has been installed on the vehicle after production, or having to modify and remove an OEM part, meaning any part of the vehicle that was originally manufactured on the vehicle. Most production sports cars and high efficiency vehicles come standard with many of these deletions in order to be competitive in the automotive and race market, while others choose to keep these drag-increasing aspects of the vehicle for their visual aspects, or to fit the typical uses of their customer base.|$|R
40|$|Lethal and {{sublethal}} {{fishing gear}} entanglement is pervasive in North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). Entanglement {{can lead to}} direct injury {{and is likely to}} incur substantial energetic costs. This study (1) evaluates drag characteristics of entangled right whales, (2) contextualizes gear drag measurements for individual whales, and (3) quantifies the benefits of partial disentanglement. A load cell measured drag forces on 15 sets of fishing gear removed from entangled right whales, a towed satellite telemetry buoy, and 200 m of polypropylene line as it was shortened to 25 m, as they were towed behind a vessel at ~ 0. 77, 1. 3, and 2. 1 m/s (~ 1. 5, 2. 5, and 4 knots) and ~ 0, 3, and 6 m depth. Mean drag ranges from 8. 5 N to 315 N, and can be predicted from the dry weight or length of the gear. Combining gear drag measurements with theoretical estimates of drag on whalesâ€™ bodies suggests that on average, entanglement increases drag and propulsive power by 1. 47 fold. Reducing trailing line length by 75 % can reduce <b>parasitic</b> gear <b>drag</b> by 85 %, reinforcing current disentanglement response practices. These drag measurements can be incorporated into disentanglement response, serious injury determination, and evaluation of sublethal effects on population dynamics...|$|R
50|$|A gravity racer obtains {{its energy}} solely {{from the force}} of gravity (assuming no {{starting}} push is permitted), which is effectively equal for any combination of racer design and course. However, performance can be greatly affected by the combined effects of various forms of drag and also the moment of inertia of the wheels, and also of course by the skill of the driver in choosing optimal lines. Drag breaks down into aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance. The latter can be minimised by careful attention to the wheel bearings, tyre sizes and pressures, and brakes (to avoid <b>parasitic</b> brake <b>drag).</b> High tyre pressures and narrower tyres will typically lower the tyre contact rolling resistance, usually at the expense of grip. Larger wheels have lower rolling resistance than small ones, and rolling resistance is also proportional to overall weight. If permitted, a 3-wheeler design will have 25% less rotational inertia than a 4-wheeler, all else being equal. Aerodynamic drag can be minimised by designing a fully enclosed body that reduces the drag coefficient, but given that this can be a highly technical thing to achieve especially for the amateur builder, and given that some aerodynamic drag is inevitable, a heavier cart will always do better than a lighter one with the same drag coefficient - its terminal velocity will be higher. For this reason there are usually class weight limits in most controlled forms of the sport. Since some of the potential energy due to gravity must be converted to the kinetic energy of the rotating wheels, a vehicle with lighter wheels will accelerate faster than one with heavier wheels. If a race is started on some form of ramp, having a tail-heavy car can also improve final acceleration, as the effective height of the centre of gravity of the vehicle is raised.|$|R
50|$|<b>Parasitic</b> <b>drag</b> is drag {{that results}} when an object is moved through a fluid medium. In {{the case of}} {{aerodynamic}} drag, the fluid medium is the atmosphere. <b>Parasitic</b> <b>drag</b> {{is a combination of}} form drag, skin friction drag and interference drag. The other components of total drag, induced drag, wave drag, and ram drag, are separate types of drag, and are not components of <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag.</b> <b>Parasitic</b> <b>drag</b> does not result from the induction of lift on the body, hence it is considered parasitic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Parasitic</b> <b>drag</b> is drag {{caused by}} moving a solid object through a fluid. <b>Parasitic</b> <b>drag</b> {{is made up}} of {{multiple}} components including viscous pressure drag (form drag), and drag due to surface roughness (skin friction drag). Additionally, the presence of multiple bodies in relative proximity may incur so called interference drag, which is sometimes described as a component of <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag.</b>|$|E
50|$|Aerodynamic drag {{comes from}} <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag</b> and lift-generated induced drag. Maximizing {{lift-to-drag}} ratio augments the aircraft efficiency, {{and this is}} attained by minimising either. As <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag</b> increase with speed but induced drag decrease simultaneously, there is an optimum speed where the sum of both is minimal, the best glide ratio. For powered aircraft, the optimum has to be balanced with thrust efficiency.|$|E
40|$|A new {{mathematical}} model is {{developed for the}} nonlinear-static, linearized-dynamic, and fully nonlinear-dynamic behavior of drillstrings in arbitrary wellbore profiles. The formulation {{is based on a}} three-dimensional nonlinear finite beam element and accounts for the fully coupled flexibility of the drillstring, geometric nonlinearity (large displacement, small strain), automatic determination of wellbore contact points, friction acting between the drillstring and the wellbore, stabilizer clearance, three-dimensional wellbore profiles, added fluid mass and damping effects from the hydrodynamic forces generated between the drillstring and surrounding fluid, complex tool geometry (including steerable mud motors, rotary steerable systems, and eccentric stabilizers/components), shear beam deformations, lateral rotary inertias, and gyroscopic effects. The resulting model is numerically validated through comparisons with analytical formulas and previous nonlinear models, showing that it can readily be applied {{to a wide range of}} drilling engineering problems and used for practical analysis. Additionally, individual contributions of shear deformations, lateral rotary inertias, and gyroscopic effects are definitively shown to be insignificant when calculating the static and dynamic behavior of horizontal drilling assemblies within the rotational speed range of most drilling applications. An initial comparison with field data is also provided, which shows the practicality of the developed algorithms in predicting the characteristics of real drilling scenarios. The model is then adjusted and applied to the specific case of inducing lateral vibrations in unconventional horizontal wells. It is proposed that exciting a lateral resonance in the drill pipe lying on the low side of a horizontal wellbore can induce enough movement to help overcome <b>parasitic</b> axial <b>drag</b> acting on a drillstring. This, in turn, would help to increase weight transfer to the bit while slide-drilling with a steerable mud motor in long lateral sections of a wellbore. The change in this lateral resonant behavior due to variations in weight-on-bit (WOB), inclination, well path curvature, wellbore diameter, fluid properties, and tubular dimensions are clearly shown through linearized-dynamic sensitivity studies. Nonlinear time-domain simulations are also performed to better understand the limitations of linearized-dynamic modeling and to provide a more detailed assessment of how inducing lateral vibration influences the WOB while drilling. It is shown that induced lateral vibrations provide a noticeable dynamic WOB of up to ? 250 lbf about the static value, and a slight increase in the average WOB value of up to 150 lbf. The effects on WOB are dependent on the excitation frequency of the induced lateral vibrations, with the greatest benefits being seen at resonant conditions...|$|R

50|$|As {{the lift}} {{generated}} by a sail increases, so does lift-induced drag, which together with <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag</b> constitutes total drag, (D). This occurs when the angle of attack increases with sail trim or change of course to cause the lift coefficient to increase {{up to the point}} of aerodynamic stall, so does the lift-induced drag coefficient. At the onset of stall, lift is abruptly decreased, as is lift-induced drag, but viscous pressure drag, a component of <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag,</b> increases due to the formation of separated flow {{on the surface of the}} sail. Sails with the apparent wind behind them (especially going downwind) operate in a stalled condition.|$|E
50|$|In {{case the}} {{configuration}} is asymmetrical {{respect to the}} XY plane, however, minimum flag differs from the <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag.</b> On these cases, a new approximate parabolic drag equation can be traced leaving the minimum drag value at zero lift value.|$|E
50|$|Various {{structural}} {{approaches have}} been proposed to mitigate sonic booms, mainly focusing around changes to aircraft noses, the use of chines, changes in aircraft planform and even creating pathways through the aircraft structure to mitigate <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag</b> that leads to shock waves.|$|E
5000|$|The phrase <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag</b> {{is mainly}} used in aerodynamics, since for lifting wings drag {{it is in}} general small {{compared}} to lift. For flow around bluff bodies, form and interference drags often dominate, and then the qualifier [...] "parasitic" [...] is meaningless.|$|E
5000|$|Due to its {{position}} much {{further from the}} center of gravity, a tailwheel supports a smaller part of the aircraft's weight allowing it to be made much smaller and lighter than a nosewheel. As a result, the smaller wheel weighs less and causes less <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag.</b>|$|E
50|$|Beyond {{reducing}} pilot workload, proper trim {{also increases}} fuel efficiency by reducing drag. For example, propeller aircraft {{have a tendency}} to yaw when operating at high power, for instance when climbing; this increases <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag</b> because the craft is not flying straight into the apparent wind. In such circumstances, the use of an adjustable rudder trim tab can reduce yaw.|$|E
50|$|<b>Parasitic</b> <b>drag</b> is {{constituted}} by form drag and skin friction drag, and grows with {{the square of}} the speed in the drag equation. The form drag is minimised by having the lowest frontal area and by streamlining the aircraft for a low drag coefficient, and skin friction is proportional to the body's surface and can be reduced by maximising laminar flow.|$|E
5000|$|Engine {{cowlings}} reduce <b>parasitic</b> <b>drag</b> {{by reducing}} the surface area, having a smooth surface and thus leading to laminar flow, and having a nose cone shape, which prevents early flow separation. The inlet and the nozzle in combination lead to an isotropic speed reduction around the cooling fins and due to the speed-squared law {{to a reduction in}} cooling drag.|$|E
