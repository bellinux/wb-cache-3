40|$|Due {{to highly}} {{competitive}} markets, constantly shifting consumer requirements, and technological advances, product families are continuously evolving over time. This product evolution leads to new <b>part</b> <b>variants</b> {{being added to}} the existing part mix. When at a future time the manufacturing system is not capable, as is or in a reconFigured state, to manufacture the evolved <b>part</b> <b>variants,</b> then this has negative consequences on business performance. This phenomena is being termed as disruptive product evolution. Due to complex interdependencies, incomplete information and uncertainty in manufacturing requirements this phenomena leads to a wicked problem. In order to tame such a wicked problem, this paper contributes and evaluates a knowledge-based decision-making approach that supports manufacturing system designers in exploring the interplay between business strategy, evolving product range and manufacturing systems.

40|$|Structural {{variants}} are {{implicated in}} numerous diseases {{and make up}} the majority of varying nucleotides among human genomes. Here we describe an integrated set of eight structural variant classes comprising both balanced and unbalanced variants, which we constructed using short-read DNA sequencing data and statistically phased onto haplotype blocks in 26 human populations. Analysing this set, we identify numerous gene-intersecting structural variants exhibiting population stratification and describe naturally occurring homozygous gene knockouts that suggest the dispensability of a variety of human genes. We demonstrate that structural variants are enriched on haplotypes identified by genome-wide association studies and exhibit enrichment for expression quantitative trait loci. Additionally, we uncover appreciable levels of structural <b>variant</b> <b>complexity</b> at different scales, including genic loci subject to clusters of repeated rearrangement and complex structural variants with multiple breakpoints likely to have formed through individual mutational events.

40|$|Introducing into {{production}} new <b>variant</b> <b>parts,</b> {{which are not}} based on customer demand, is a major cost driver in manufacturing companies due to the growing complexity of the underlying processes.

However, to measure changes in costs after each addition of a new <b>variant</b> <b>part</b> would be a time-consuming and - without knowledge of future processes - limited method. Cross-departmental implications are calculated for different categories of <b>variant</b> <b>parts.</b> The measurement is applied to a municipal and agricultural machinery maker.

Kitting and sequence based materials supply are two examples of when materials {{preparation is}} used in industry, where different <b>part</b> <b>variants</b> are collected to packages intended for one or multiple assembly objects. The use of materials preparation in industry is increasing along with the increasing amount of <b>part</b> <b>variants</b> in need of handling in the production system, while knowledge on how the materials preparation should be designed in regard to the materials preparation performance objectives of quality, flexibility and time efficiency, needs further research. In addition, rapid developments in information technology calls for new research in terms of how the new technology fits in the materials preparation process. The purpose of the thesis is to expand knowledge of how the desired performance of materials preparation in terms of flexibility, quality, and time efficiency influences the design of materials preparation. In the thesis, results are presented from literature studies, two multiple case studies and an experiment. The results presented focus on how options in the materials preparation design influence the materials preparation performance. An experiment, focusing time efficiency, together with two case studies on flexibility and quality performance, respectively forms the empirical basis of a framework for how the performance requirements influence the materials preparation design, in terms of the links between the studied design variables and the performance requirements. The framework also considers the materials preparation context and trade-offs in the materials preparation design in regard to the three performance requirements. The thesis contributes to practice by providing guidance to the materials preparation designer in terms of the performance to expect when choosing among options of the materials preparation design variables. The theoretical contribution of the thesis pertains to the developed framework that describes the relation between materials preparation design and performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Product variant {{design is}} one of the key {{technologies}} of Manufacturing Enterprise for responding market demand. During the product variant design, dimensional tolerance variant design plays an important role. However, dimensional tolerance variant design is considered rarely in the researches of product variant design. To solve the dimensional tolerance variant design during product variant design, information expression, extraction and labeling method of dimensioning of dimensional tolerance of part dimension model is investigated. A variant design method with dimensional tolerance is presented in this paper. In the method, dimension variant design and dimensional tolerance variant design are integrated, so dimension variant design and dimensional tolerance variant design are implemented concurrently. A <b>part</b> <b>variant</b> design module with dimension and dimensional tolerance based on SolidWorks is developed for using Visual C++. Finally, an example of shaft illustrates the proposed method...|$|R

Secondly, reusable part can be found from existing parts through similarity analysis.

40|$|Process {{complexity}} {{is one of}} {{the basic}} <b>variants</b> of Kolmogorov <b>complexity.</b> Unlike plain Kolmogorov complexity, process complexity provides a simple characterization of randomness for real numbers in terms of initial segment complexity. Process complexity was first developed in (Schnorr 1973). Schnorr’s definition of a process, while simple, can be difficult to work with. In many situations, a preferable definition of a process is that given by Levin in (Levin & Zvonkin 1970). In this paper we define a <b>variant</b> of process <b>complexity</b> based on Levin’s definition of a process. We call this <b>variant</b> strict process <b>complexity.</b> Strict process complexity retains the main desirable properties of process complexity. Particularly, it provides simple characterizations of Martin-Löf random real numbers, and of computable real numbers. However, we will prove that strict process complexity does not agree within an additive constant with Schnorr’s original process complexity. One of the basic properties of prefix-free complexity is that it is subadditive. Subadditive means that there is some constant d such that for all strings σ, τ the complexity of στ (σ and τ concatenated) is {{less than or equal to}} the sum of the complexities of σ and τ plus d. A fundamental question about any complexity measure is whether or not it is subadditive. In this paper we resolve this question for process complexity by proving that neither of these process complexities is subadditive. ...|$|R
