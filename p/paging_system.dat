500|$|Alcatraz Library {{was located}} {{at the end of}} D-Block. Upon {{entering}} Alcatraz, every inmate was given a library card and a catalog of books found in the library; inmates could place orders by putting a slip with their card in a box {{at the entrance to the}} dining hall before breakfast, and the books would be delivered to and from their cell by a librarian. [...] The library, which utilized a closed-stack <b>paging</b> <b>system,</b> had a collection of 10,000 to 15,000 books, mainly left over from the army days. [...] Inmates were permitted a maximum of three books in addition to up to 12 text books, a Bible, and a dictionary. [...] They were permitted to subscribe to magazines but crime-related pages were torn out and newspapers were prohibited. Sex, crime and violence were censored from all books and magazines, and the library was governed by a chaplain who regulated the censorship and the nature of the reading material to ensure that the material was wholesome. [...] Failure to return books by the date given made the inmate liable to removal of privileges. The average prisoner read 75 to 100 books a year. Every evening, inmates would generally read books loaned from the library and usually an hour or 75 minutes was allocated to the practicing of musical instruments, from the guitar to the accordion. A prison band often practiced in the dining room or auditorium above it; Al Capone famously practiced the banjo in the shower block, although most prisoners were limited to playing in their cells alone.|$|E

Murray rented a floor in the Writers Guild of America, West building, although the team of Rocko was {{not a part of}} the union, which the staff found ironic. Sunwoo Entertainment, and later Rough Draft Studios, assembled the animation. According to Murray, as Rocko's Modern Life was his first television series, he did not know about the atmosphere of typical animation studios. Murray said that he opted to operate his studio in a similar manner to the operation of his Saratoga, California studio, which he describes as [...] "very relaxed". His cadre included many veterans who, according to him, described the experience as [...] "the most fun they had ever had!" [...] He, saying that the atmosphere was [...] "not my doing", credited his team members for collectively contributing. Murray described the daily atmosphere at the studio as [...] "very loose", adding that the rules permitted all staff members to use the <b>paging</b> <b>system</b> to make announcements.

Murray stated that 70 people in the United States and over 200 people in South Korea and Japan animated the series.|$|E
