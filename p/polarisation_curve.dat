40|$|Aluminium and {{stainless}} steels {{are susceptible to}} pitting corrosion in sea water. Mild steel is susceptible to corrosion in general. Titanium however, has good corrosion resistance in chloride solutions and thus is not susceptible to pitting in sea water. The following is {{an assessment of the}} corrosion resistance of Titanium powder coatings. Potentiostatic electrochemical experiments were carried out on three substrates (stainless steel, mild steel and Aluminium) coated using two spray methods (plasma and HVOF). A discussion of the results was given with reference to the <b>polarisation</b> <b>curves</b> that were created, SEM images, XRD results, estimates of porosity, and Pourbaix diagrams. It was concluded that the plasma coating provides the best corrosion resistance {{due to the fact that}} it had less porosity than HVOF and that it is made up of Titanium oxides.

Utilising a simple model to quantify the change in mechanisms, iR free results of the fuel cell experiments are fit and found to be represented by a common set of parameters.

The data is used to estimate a mass specific exchange current density towards the ORR in the range 10 - 11 - 10 - 13 A g- 1 depending on the catalyst. For the reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide, the mass specific exchange current density is estimated to be in the range 10 - 2 - 10 - 3 A g- 1.
