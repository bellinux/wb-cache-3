5|$|The bombardments {{failed to}} cause {{significant}} <b>physical</b> <b>damage,</b> {{but had a}} major psychological impact on the residents of Sydney and Newcastle. Due to the inaccuracy of the submarines' range-finding equipment, coupled with the unstable firing platform of a submarine at sea, specific targeting was impossible. The intention of the submarine bombardment was to frighten {{the population of the}} target area.|$|E
5|$|Tremors were felt {{to varying}} degrees {{throughout}} New York State, including by people in some buildings in Manhattan. <b>Physical</b> <b>damage</b> occurred in Brooklyn, where a chimney in Red Hook was toppled. There were some disruptions, including building evacuations and delays at airports. Amtrak train service at Penn Station was also delayed.|$|E

40|$|Fruits are {{important}} horticultural products for human sustenance. Tropical region produces high variety of fruits species. Fruits are naturally produced for local consumption and processed products. Most of tropical fruits are cultivated in developing countries. Due to lacks {{of knowledge of}} fruits growers, limited fruit harvesting and handling facilities, long distance between production fields and fruit markets/destination, and fruits are perishable in mature, these horticultural products are prompted to <b>physical</b> <b>damages.</b> This becomes constraint in promoting purpose. This paper describes <b>physical</b> <b>damages</b> of several tropical fruits hopping that the presented information is useful for growers, government and fruits traders...|$|R
5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is <b>physical</b> <b>damage</b> to body tissues caused by a {{difference}} in pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Carriage and {{shipment}} of {{some kinds of}} lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation (particularly aircraft) because of the ability of most types of lithium batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when short-circuited, leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway. Most consumer lithium batteries have built-in thermal overload protection to prevent this type of incident, or are otherwise designed to limit short-circuit currents. Internal shorts from manufacturing defect or <b>physical</b> <b>damage</b> can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway.|$|E
5|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>damage</b> {{can also}} reduce the value of carrot crops. The two main forms of damage are splitting, whereby a {{longitudinal}} crack develops during growth {{that can be a}} few centimetres to {{the entire length of the}} root, and breaking, which occurs postharvest. These disorders can affect over 30% of commercial crops. Factors associated with high levels of splitting include wide plant spacing, early sowing, lengthy growth durations, and genotype.|$|E

50|$|In some mammals, such as {{hedgehogs}} and porcupines, {{the hairs}} have been modified into hard spines or quills. These {{are covered with}} thick plates of keratin and serve as protection against predators. Thick hair {{such as that of}} the lion's mane and grizzly bear's fur do offer some protection from <b>physical</b> <b>damages</b> such as bites and scratches.|$|R
5|$|The Japanese {{government}} {{was concerned about}} the results of the March firebombing attacks as the raids had demonstrated that the Japanese military was unable to protect the nation's airspace. As well as the extensive <b>physical</b> <b>damage</b> in the targeted cities, the attacks also caused increased absenteeism as civilians were afraid to leave their homes to work in factories which might be bombed. Japanese air defenses were reinforced in response to the firebombing raids, but remained inadequate; 450 fighters were assigned to defensive duties in April.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} medieval cannon, the pot-de-fer, had bulbous, vase-like shape, and {{was used}} more for psychological effect than for causing <b>physical</b> <b>damage.</b> The later culverin was transitional between the handgun and the full cannon, {{and was used}} as an anti-personnel weapon. During the 15th century, cannon advanced significantly, so that bombards were effective siege engines. Towards the end of the period, the cannon gradually replaced siege enginesamong other forms of aging weaponryon the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|The {{three factors}} of Virchow's triad—venous stasis, hypercoagulability, {{and changes in}} the endothelial blood vessel lining (such as <b>physical</b> <b>damage</b> or endothelial {{activation}})—contribute to DVT and are used to explain its formation. Other related causes include activation of immune system components, the state of microparticles in the blood, the concentration of oxygen, and possible platelet activation. Various risk factors contribute to DVT, though many at high risk never develop it.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the <b>physical</b> <b>damages</b> {{of logging}} {{activities}} using Urus MIII forest skylines on residual trees and seedlings were evaluated through comparison between harvesting operations {{took place in}} winter and summer seasons in Artvin region. In order to achieve our aims, both in winter and summer, 4 representative plots were taken in the harvesting areas using Urus MIII skyline. <b>Physical</b> <b>damages</b> caused by logging to residual trees and seedling were noted. Damage classes for the residual trees were divided into 4 categories as (0 :no injury, 1 :light injury, 2 :medium injury, 3 :heavy injury) and 5 categories for the seedlings as (0 :no injury, 1 :light injury, 2 :medium injury, 3 :heavy injury, 4 :dead trees). As a result, it has been concluded that logging activities on snowy terrain during winter caused less damage on residual trees and seedling {{than that of the}} logging during summer seaso...|$|R

40|$|The manual {{transportation}} of banana bunches within plots provokes <b>physical</b> <b>damages</b> to fruits compromising their quality. To assess {{the influence of}} the distance banana bunches travel on the shoulders of harvesters within the plot, on the incidence of <b>physical</b> <b>damages</b> present on the peel of fruits of the Nanicão cultivar, two experiments were carried out in the Vale do Ribeira region (SP), in sites with slope < 1 %. Each experiment divided the plot in different distance bands, two of which were included in this study: one located far away from the collection roads (30 - 50 m and 80 - 100 m distance bands) and another in an intermediate position (70 - 80 m and 130 - 150 m distance bands). For each distance band, six banana bunches of 36 mm gauged fruits were randomly sampled. Four banana hands were cut from the middle region of each bunch and ten fruits were assessed per hand, totaling 240 fruits per treatment. Bunches were harvested at the same maturity degree and those served as control were not transported. A total of 1440 fruits was assessed in the two experiments. The <b>physical</b> <b>damages</b> on the fruit surface were graded on a scale with 6 divisions: 0 - 0. 25 cm²; 0. 25 - 0. 5 cm²; 0. 5 - 1. 0 cm²; 1. 0 - 1. 5 cm²; 1. 5 - 2. 0 cm²; 2. 0 - 2. 5 cm². The bunches transported on the shoulders of harvesters on distances over 70 m suffered increased (P < 0. 01) damaged area. Most damages presented areas up to 0. 5 cm²...|$|R
5|$|The town {{continued}} {{to expand in}} the 20th century, annexing Caversham across the River Thames in Oxfordshire in 1911. Compared to many other English towns and cities, Reading suffered little <b>physical</b> <b>damage</b> during {{either of the two}} World Wars that afflicted the 20th century, although many citizens were killed or injured in the conflicts. One significant air raid occurred on 10 February 1943, when a single Luftwaffe plane machine-gunned and bombed the town centre, resulting in 41 deaths and over 100 injuries.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} to battery {{was given in}} Wilkinson v Downton, where emotional distress was considered a possible battery despite no physical force being used. The defendant told the claimant (as a practical joke) {{that her husband had}} been seriously injured. As a result, the claimant suffered a nervous disorder and was thought to be suicidal for a time. It was held that such an action will be valid under battery where it is calculated to cause <b>physical</b> <b>damage</b> and does so. The principle was extended by Khorasandjian v Bush, in 1993, where there was a risk that the defendant's actions would cause physical or psychiatric damage. The tort set down in Wilkinson is normally considered a separate tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.|$|E
5|$|Books are {{sometimes}} attacked by cockroaches, silverfish, book mites, booklice, and various beetles which {{feed on the}} covers, paper, bindings and glue. They leave behind <b>physical</b> <b>damage</b> {{in the form of}} tiny holes as well as staining from their faeces. Book pests include the larder beetle, and the larvae of the black carpet beetle and the drugstore beetle which attack leather-bound books, while the common clothes moth and the brown house moth attack cloth bindings. These attacks are largely a problem with historic books, because modern bookbinding materials are less susceptible to this type of damage.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSpurious {{electromagnetic}} emanations can propagate {{along the}} power-grid cable network of critical infrastructures, which poses unacceptable risks for their security and safety. According to international standards, protective devices {{have to be}} inserted in low-voltage distribution networks {{in order to prevent}} <b>physical</b> <b>damages</b> due to either overload or short-circuit. We propose here to characterize these devices by measuring their scattering parameters in order to estimate their effects on the conducted propagation of electromagnetic interference...|$|R
5|$|Changes of {{sediment}} {{patterns in the}} creek have also created another problem. Stemming from the construction of structures interfering with stream flow, and increased runoff from the urban areas adjoining the creek, excessive erosion has created problems not limited to just the creek. The creek is eroding material from its bed and transporting it to the ocean, but naturally, sediment from the whole watershed flowed towards the main stem via a complex network of tributaries. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers warned in a 1997 study that up to $4.2million in damage occurs per year {{as a result of}} the pollution of Aliso Creek and its neighbor San Juan Creek. This includes <b>physical</b> <b>damage</b> to creek banks, bridges, pipes and other creekside structures.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{conducted}} {{nuclear tests}} on Amchitka. Despite being {{designated as a}} national wildlife refuge by President William Taft in 1913, Amchitka was chosen as a nuclear testing site by the AEC. There were several reasons for this decision. Firstly, Amchitka {{was close to the}} former Soviet Union, making it an ideal location for a nuclear test to intimidate the latter. However, the public reason given by the AEC was the island's remoteness. Forceful objections were raised against the testing by a number of organisations and groups, most notably the Aleut people, who, although they vacated the island in the 19th century after Russian fur traders reduced sea otter numbers in the area, are resident on nearby islands, and were concerned about radiation leaks as well as potential <b>physical</b> <b>damage</b> resulting from the nuclear tests.|$|E
5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be <b>physical</b> <b>damage,</b> as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected to avoid it.|$|E

In 1968 coverage was arranged for pre-launch and launch perils for the Intelsat III satellite. Satellites are very complex machines which are manufactured {{and used by}} governments and a few larger companies. The budget for a typical satellite project can be in excess {{of billions of dollars}} and can run 5-10 years including the planning, manufacturing, testing, and launch.|$|R
5|$|Neck rot is a {{fungal disease}} {{affecting}} onions in storage. It {{is caused by}} Botrytis allii, which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb, causing a grey mould to develop. The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. Large quantities of spores are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop. In time, a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry, mummified structure. This disease may be present throughout the growing period, but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage. Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing <b>physical</b> <b>damage</b> to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of circulating air.|$|E
5|$|The two princes {{had been}} in dispute over who should marry Irene Dushmani, the only {{daughter}} of Lekë Dushmani, prince of Zadrima. In 1445, the Albanian princes {{had been in}}vited to the wedding of Skanderbeg's younger sister, Mamica, who was being married to Muzaka Thopia. Irene entered the wedding and hostilities began. Dukagjini asked Irene to marry him, but Zaharia, who was drunk, saw this, and assaulted Dukagjini. Some princes attempted to stop the fight, but only more people became involved. Several people died or got injured before peace was established. Neither of the two antagonists had suffered any <b>physical</b> <b>damage,</b> but after the event Dukagjini was morally humiliated.|$|E
5|$|Crisis Core uses a {{real-time}} {{combat system}} in which the player can move Zack around, initiate attacks, special abilities and spells, use items, and block or dodge attacks. Zack's abilities in battle are set by what materia he currently has equipped. Up to six materia can be equipped at any one time, which can impart special attacks, magic spells, or passive bonuses such as health increases or the ability to display the statistics of the current foe in combat. Materia are gained throughout the game through exploration, as rewards from side missions, as spoils of battle, or from shops. Materia can be fused together to make more powerful versions with improved bonuses; for example, fusing an attack materia with an elemental magic materia can create a new attack skill materia that inflicts elemental magic damage in addition to <b>physical</b> <b>damage.</b> Special items collected in the game can also be used in materia fusion to further increase the materia's power.|$|E
40|$|We {{succeeded in}} {{applying}} electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) technique {{to visualize the}} current leakage sites in the MOS devices with HfSiON gate dielectrics. The occurrence of initial leakage sites in fresh devices has been investigated with consideration {{of the effects of}} well type, gate size and gate electrode. Stress-induced leakage and breakdown sites were studied by in situ voltage stress and EBIC characterization. Finally, the micro-structure and <b>physical</b> <b>damages</b> at various leakage sites were characterized by TEM. Based on the EBIC and TEM results, the leakage and breakdown mechanisms of HfSiON gate stacks were discussed...|$|R

50|$|Included in the rulebook are {{a listing}} of general {{ways in which the}} modern world might {{experience}} an apocalypse, drawing on sources which include religious eschatology, current science, and popular fiction. These methods include, among others: an environmental disaster, alien invasion, nuclear war, plague, and supernatural disaster. For each scenario, a brief description outlines the scenario and its particular effects on the setting. For instance, a plague scenario would not carry with it the same radiation dangers and <b>physical</b> <b>damages</b> to the infrastructure as would a nuclear war.|$|R
