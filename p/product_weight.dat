Here, technical barriers to trade refer to measures such as labelling requirements, standards on technical specifications and quality standards, and other measures protecting the environment.

Since then, these sets have largely been ignored since {{a number of other}} constructions have been discovered which achieve a better convergence rate. However, it has recently been discovered that the $p$-sets perform well in terms of the dependence on the dimension. We prove bounds on the weighted star discrepancy of the $p$-sets which hold for any choice of <b>weights.</b> For <b>product</b> <b>weights</b> we give conditions under which the discrepancy bounds are independent of the dimension $s$.

50|$|A Fork lift can be {{arranged}} {{in more ways than}} an L-shaped conveyor or a platform lift and a spiral conveyor. A fork-lift is a product lift which lifts products from a conveyor using a fork and then places them at a different level on another conveyor. Such a fork-lift makes it possible to introduce or remove products at an angle of 90 degrees. As a result, the number of possible input and output combinations is somewhat larger. Because of the possibility of sliding conveyors in or out of the lift, a fork-lift can also be used as a vertical sorting system. With such a sorting installation, a product can be entered and removed at any level and a product can be lifted and lowered using one lift. The power and thus the energy consumption of the drive is considerably lower with a fork-lift than with other systems, since only the <b>product</b> <b>weight</b> needs to be transported and the forks maintain a balance between each other in the rising and lowering section. Another difference between a fork-lift and an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift is the complexity of the control. With an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift, input and output must be completely synchronous, whereas this is not necessary with a fork-lift. This ensures considerably simpler controls.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop equations to predict retail product and fat trim (weights and percentages) for Nellore (Bos indicus) cattle. Live ultrasound measurements of the longissimus muscle area, backfat thickness at the 12 th rib and rump fat depth and shrunk body weight were obtained from 218 Nellore steers to predict weights and percentages of carcass retail product, pistola retail product and fat trimmings. After slaughter, carcasses were deboned and weighed and percentages of retail cuts were obtained directly. Measurements taken directly in the carcasses explained 97 % and 36 % of variation in carcass retail <b>product</b> <b>weight</b> and percentage, and 94 % and 36 % of variation in pistola retail weight and percentage, respectively. Live measurements explained 93 % of carcass retail <b>product</b> <b>weight</b> and 39 % of carcass retail product percentage. Lower accuracies were observed for pistola retail <b>product</b> <b>weight</b> (R 2 = 0. 87) and percentage (R 2 = 0. 33). Accuracies for fat trimmings weight and percentage were 79 % and 55 %, respectively. Ultrasound rump fat thickness showed greater correlations with retail product and fat trimmings (weights and percentages) when compared with ultrasound backfat thickness. The weight and percentage of retail products and of trimmable fat can be estimated in Nellore steers from live animal measurements, with similar accuracy to equations developed based on carcass measurements obtained at slaughter. 201...|$|E
