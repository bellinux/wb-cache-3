5|$|Historical {{observations}} of the carnivorous syndrome in plant species have been restricted to the more obvious examples of carnivory, such as the active trapping mechanisms of Drosera and Dionaea, though authors have often noted speculation about other species {{that may not be}} so obviously carnivorous. In one of the earlier publications on carnivorous plants, Charles Darwin had suggested many plants that have developed adhesive glands, such as Erica tetralix, Mirabilis longifolia, <b>Pelargonium</b> zonale, Primula sinesis, and Saxifraga umbrosa, may indeed be carnivorous but little research has been done on them. Darwin himself only mentioned these species in passing and did not follow through with any investigation. Adding to the small but growing list, Francis Lloyd provided his own list of species suspected of carnivory in his 1942 book on carnivorous plants, though these species and their potential were only mentioned in the introduction. Later, in a 1981 review of the literature, Paul Simons rediscovered Italian journal articles from the early 1900s that identified several additional sticky species that digested insect prey. Simons was surprised to find these articles lacking in the literature cited sections of many modern books and articles on carnivorous plants, suggesting that academic research has treated Lloyd's 1942 book as the authoritative and comprehensive source on pre-1942 research on the carnivorous syndrome.|$|E

25|$|<b>Pelargonium</b> has between 200 - 280 species. The Plant List {{currently}} accepts 250 species names. Röschenbleck et al lists 281 taxa.

The nomenclature has changed considerably since the first plants were introduced to Europe in the 17th century.|$|E
25|$|These {{are known}} as zonal geraniums because many have zones or {{patterns}} {{in the center of}} the leaves, this is the contribution of the <b>Pelargonium</b> zonale parent. Common names include storksbill, fish or horseshoe geraniums. They are also referred to as <b>Pelargonium</b> ×hortorum Bailey. Zonal pelargoniums are tetraploid, mostly derived from P.inquinans and P.zonale, together with P.scandens and P.frutetorum.|$|E

25|$|Unique in {{sense of}} not fitting {{into any of}} the above categories. The {{parentage}} of Unique <b>pelargoniums</b> is confused and obscure. One theory being a derivation from P.fulgidum, but a derivation from an older cultivar 'Old Unique’, also known as or ‘Rollinson’s Crimson’, in the mid-19th century is also claimed. Unique <b>pelargoniums</b> resemble upright Scented Leaf <b>pelargoniums</b> in being shrubby and woody evergreens. They have distinctly scented leaves, and small flowers with blotched and feathered petals. They may have bicolour foliage. Some types, popularly known in the hobby as hybrid Uniques, have been crossed with Regal <b>pelargoniums</b> and, {{as a result of this}} cross, are much more floriferous.|$|R

25|$|<b>Pelargonium</b> {{is a large}} genus {{within the}} Geraniaceae family, which has a {{worldwide}} distribution in temperate to subtropical zones with some 800 mostly herbaceous species. <b>Pelargonium</b> itself is native to southern Africa (including Namibia) and Australia. Southern Africa contains 90% of the genus, with only about 30 species found elsewhere, predominantly the East African rift valley (about 20 species) and southern Australia, including Tasmania. The remaining few species are found in southern Madagascar, Yemen, Iraq, Asia Minor, the north of New Zealand and isolated islands in the south Atlantic Ocean (Saint Helena and Tristan da Cunha) and Socotra in the Indian Ocean. The centre of diversity is in southwestern South Africa where rainfall is confined to the winter, {{unlike the rest of}} the country where rainfall is predominantly in the summer months. Most of the <b>Pelargonium</b> plants cultivated in Europe and North America have their origins in South Africa.|$|E
