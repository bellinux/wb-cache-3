25|$|In {{order to}} travel to another country, a Norwegian citizen {{requires}} a passport, except within the Nordic <b>Passport</b> <b>Union,</b> where no identity card is formally required. An identity card such as a Norwegian driving license is however useful.|$|E
25|$|Despite the <b>passport</b> <b>union</b> with Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland, Finland {{could not}} join the Nordic Council until 1955 because of Soviet fears that Finland might become {{too close to}} the West. At that time the Soviet Union saw the Nordic Council as part of NATO of which Denmark, Norway and Iceland were members.|$|E

25|$|The Øresund Bridge {{crosses the}} border between Denmark and Sweden, but in {{accordance}} with the Schengen Agreement and the Nordic <b>Passport</b> <b>Union,</b> there are usually no passport inspections. There are random customs checks at the entrance toll booths entering Sweden, but not when entering Denmark. Since January 2016, checks have become significantly more stringent due to the European migrant crisis.|$|E
25|$|The Faroe Islands are {{not part}} of the Schengen Area, and Schengen visas are not valid. However, the islands are part of the Nordic <b>Passport</b> <b>Union</b> and the Schengen Agreement {{provides}} that travellers passing between the islands and the Schengen Area are not to be treated as passing the external frontier of the Area. This means that there is an identity check at air or boat travel to the islands where Nordic citizens on intra-Nordic travel need no passport, only showing the ticket plus identity card.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Finland and the {{countries}} of the Nordic Council entered into a <b>passport</b> <b>union,</b> allowing their citizens to cross borders without passports and soon also to apply for jobs and claim social security benefits in the other countries. Many from Finland used this opportunity to secure better-paying jobs in Sweden in the 1950s and 1960s, dominating Sweden's first wave of post-war labour immigrants. Although Finnish wages and standard of living could not compete with wealthy Sweden until the 1970s, the Finnish economy rose remarkably from the ashes of World War II, resulting in the buildup of another Nordic-style welfare state.|$|E

50|$|Between 2013 and 2014, Obregón {{was invited}} for trials by clubs in Europe but, {{since he could}} not move there without a European <b>Union</b> <b>passport,</b> he moved back {{with his family to}} Miami and joined the academy for the Under-16s of the South Florida {{non-profit}} youth soccer club, Weston F.C.|$|R
25|$|The Schengen Area {{consists}} of 26 states, including four {{which are not}} members of the European Union (EU). Two of the non-EU members, Iceland and Norway, {{are part of the}} Nordic <b>Passport</b> <b>Union</b> and are officially classified as 'states associated with the Schengen activities of the EU'. Switzerland was subsequently allowed to participate in the same manner in 2008. Liechtenstein joined the Schengen Area on 19 December 2011. De facto, the Schengen Area also includes three European micro-statesMonaco, San Marino and the Vatican Citythat maintain open or semi-open borders with other Schengen member countries. Two EU membersIreland and the United Kingdomnegotiated opt-outs from Schengen and continue to operate the Common Travel Area systematic border controls with other EU member states.|$|E
25|$|On 12 November 2015, {{the cabinet}} {{introduced}} temporary border controls with immediate effect. The cabinet also proposed identity checks for every individual passing the Danish-Swedish border and {{closing of the}} Öresund Bridge, giving up the latter on 8 December 2015 after severe criticism. On 17 December 2015, the Riksdag passed legislation to introduce identity checks with the votes 175 in favor, 39 against and 135 abstained. On 4 January 2016, the identity checks was introduced, which means that {{people who can not}} show a valid identity card, license or passport are not allowed to cross the border into Sweden, breaking with the Nordic <b>Passport</b> <b>Union</b> {{for the first time since}} 1954. Only twelve hours later the Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen announced that Denmark will implement temporary border controls along the German-Danish border with immediate effect as a consequence of Sweden's identity checks.|$|E
25|$|As {{explicitly}} asserted by both treaties of the European Union, the Faroe Islands are {{not part}} of the European Union. The Faroes are not grouped with the EU when it comes to international trade; for instance, when the EU and Russia imposed reciprocal trade sanctions on each other over the War in Donbass in 2014, the Faroes began exporting significant amounts of fresh salmon to Russia. Moreover, a protocol to the treaty of accession of Denmark to the European Communities stipulates that Danish nationals residing in the Faroe Islands are not considered Danish nationals within the meaning of the treaties. Hence, Danish people living in the Faroes are not citizens of the European Union (though other EU nationals living there remain EU citizens). The Faroes are not covered by the Schengen Agreement, but there are no border checks when travelling between the Faroes and any Schengen country (the Faroes have been part of the Nordic <b>Passport</b> <b>Union</b> since 1966, and since 2001 there have been no permanent border checks between the Nordic countries and the rest of the Schengen Area as part of the Schengen agreement).|$|E

These rights were extended to all foreign residents in 1983. The voters enrollment is automatic. As {{a consequence of}} the 1983 extension, a 1990 bilateral treaty between Norway and Spain granted voting rights in Spain for Norwegian citizens. Currently, residing citizens of Nordic <b>Passport</b> <b>Union</b> countries may vote in local elections on the same basis as Norwegian citizens without any length of residence condition.|$|E

50|$|An {{overseas}} quota {{restricting the}} maximum number of foreign players at each club has existed since the inception of the Super League in 1996. However, overseas players that hold a European <b>Union</b> <b>passport</b> or come under the Kolpak ruling do not count towards the quota. This resulted in the number of non-British players at some clubs greatly exceeding the quota.|$|R

2500|$|In the {{following}} legal purge, 53,000 people were sentenced for treason and 25 were executed. The post-war years saw an {{increased interest in}} Scandinavism, resulting in Scandinavian Airlines System in 1946, the Nordic Council in 1952 and the Nordic <b>Passport</b> <b>Union</b> [...] along with the metric system being introduced. Reconstruction after the war gave Norway the highest economic growth in Europe until 1950, partially created through rationing private consumption allowing for higher industrial investments. The Labor Party retained power throughout the period and enforced a policy of public planning. The University of Bergen was created in 1946. The 1950s saw a boom in construction of hydroelectricity and the state built the steel mill Norsk Jernverk and two aluminum works. State banks such as the State Housing Bank, the State Educational Loan Fund and Postbanken allowed for governmental control over private debt. Oslo hosted the 1952 Winter Olympics.|$|E

However, he was blocked by a non-EU players rule of Italian Football Federation, that amateur club can only sign two non-EU players, given an application was submitted on 31 December 2015. He obtained a resident status in Italy in February, making him eligible for a European <b>Union</b> <b>passport.</b>|$|R

50|$|Since March 25, 2001, the Schengen acquis has fully {{applied to}} the five {{countries}} of the Nordic <b>Passport</b> <b>Union</b> (except for the Faroe Islands).

50|$|Tourism {{is a key}} {{industry}} and, according to Abkhazian authorities, almost a million tourists (mainly from Russia) came to Abkhazia in 2007. Since Abkhazia and Russia have signed a visa-free travel agreement, Russian passport-holders do not require a visa to enter Abkhazia. Holders of European <b>Union</b> <b>passports</b> require an Entry Permit Letter issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Sukhumi, against which a visa will be issued upon presentation of the Letter to the Ministry.|$|R
50|$|The Andorran {{government}} imposes no {{visa requirements}} on its visitors and only requires a <b>passport</b> or European <b>Union</b> {{national identity card}} for entrance. However, since the country is only accessible via the Schengen countries Spain or France, entrance is not possible without entering the Schengen area first and the Schengen visa rules can therefore be regarded to apply de facto. Because Andorra {{is not part of}} the Schengen area, a multiple entry visa is required to reenter the Schengen area when leaving Andorra.|$|R
