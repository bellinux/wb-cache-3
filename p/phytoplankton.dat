5|$|Ctenophores may balance marine {{ecosystems}} {{by preventing}} an over-abundance of copepods from eating all the <b>phytoplankton</b> (planktonic plants), {{which are the}} dominant marine producers of organic matter from non-organic ingredients.|$|E
5|$|Sperm whales {{increase}} {{levels of}} primary production and carbon export by depositing iron-rich faeces into surface {{waters of the}} Southern Ocean. The iron-rich faeces cause <b>phytoplankton</b> to grow and take up more carbon from the atmosphere. When the <b>phytoplankton</b> dies, it sinks to the deep ocean and takes the atmospheric carbon with it. By reducing the abundance of sperm whales in the Southern Ocean, whaling has resulted in an extra 2 million tonnes of carbon remaining in the atmosphere each year.|$|E
5|$|The flora of {{the lake}} {{includes}} various types of <b>phytoplankton,</b> emerged macrophytes, floating macrophytes, and submerged macrophytes, while the surrounding countryside is rainforest including areas of Sumatran tropical pine forests on the higher mountainsides.|$|E
5|$|In bays {{where they}} occur in very high numbers, {{predation}} by ctenophores may control {{the populations of}} small zooplanktonic organisms such as copepods, which might otherwise wipe out the <b>phytoplankton</b> (planktonic plants), which are {{a vital part of}} marine food chains.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} stated that sperm whales, {{as well as}} other large cetaceans, help {{fertilise}} the surface of the ocean by consuming nutrients in the depths and transporting those nutrients to the oceans' surface when they defecate, an effect known as the whale pump. This fertilises <b>phytoplankton</b> and other plants {{on the surface of the}} ocean and contributes to ocean productivity and the drawdown of atmospheric carbon.|$|E
5|$|Whales defecate at the ocean's surface; their {{excrement}} {{is important}} for fisheries because it is rich in iron and nitrogen. The whale faeces are liquid and instead of sinking, they stay at the surface where <b>phytoplankton</b> feed off it.|$|E
5|$|All organisms can exhibit behaviours. Even plants express complex behaviour, {{including}} {{memory and}} communication. Behavioural ecology {{is the study}} of an organism's behaviour in its environment and its ecological and evolutionary implications. Ethology {{is the study of}} observable movement or behaviour in animals. This could include investigations of motile sperm of plants, mobile <b>phytoplankton,</b> zooplankton swimming toward the female egg, the cultivation of fungi by weevils, the mating dance of a salamander, or social gatherings of amoeba.|$|E
5|$|Bowie Seamount {{supports}} a biologically rich {{area with a}} vigorous ecosystem. Studies have recorded high densities of crab, sea stars, sea anemones, sponges, squid, octopus, rockfish, halibut and sablefish. Eight species of marine mammal {{have been found in}} the Bowie Seamount area, including Steller sea lions, orca, humpback and sperm whales, along with 16varieties of seabirds. This has made Bowie Seamount a rare habitat in the northeast Pacific Ocean {{and one of the most}} biologically rich submarine volcanoes on Earth. The rich marine life is due to the intense food supply of microscopic animals and plants, including <b>phytoplankton</b> and zooplankton.|$|E
5|$|Dinoflagellates may use {{bioluminescence}} for defence against predators. They shine {{when they}} detect a predator, possibly making the predator itself more vulnerable by attracting {{the attention of}} predators from higher trophic levels. Grazing copepods release any <b>phytoplankton</b> cells that flash, unharmed; if they were eaten they would make the copepods glow, attracting predators, so the phytoplankton's bioluminescence is defensive. The problem of shining stomach contents is solved (and the explanation corroborated) in predatory deep-sea fishes: their stomachs have a black lining {{able to keep the}} light from any bioluminescent fish prey which they have swallowed from attracting larger predators.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, {{during the}} Antarctic summer when <b>phytoplankton</b> bloom was apparent, {{the lake was}} studied, along with several others in the Vestfold Hills area to assess the reduced sulfuric gases by gas chromatography. The gases were trapped in a solid {{adsorbent}} – a molecular sieve with 5 Å pores (80–100 mesh) – and reduced sulfur compounds (RSCs) were detected. The most apparent RSCs were dimethyl sulfide (DMS), carbonyl sulfide and hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{species of}} benthic foraminifera became extinct during the K–Pg {{extinction}} event, presumably because {{they depend on}} organic debris for nutrients, since the biomass in the ocean {{is thought to have}} decreased. As the marine microbiota recovered, however, it is thought that increased speciation of benthic foraminifera resulted from the increase in food sources. <b>Phytoplankton</b> recovery in the early Paleocene provided the food source to support large benthic foraminiferal assemblages, which are mainly detritus-feeding. Ultimate recovery of the benthic populations occurred over several stages lasting several hundred thousand years into the early Paleocene.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{grown as}} {{industrial}} crops {{are the source}} {{of a wide range of}} products used in manufacturing, sometimes so intensively as to risk harm to the environment. Nonfood products include essential oils, natural dyes, pigments, waxes, resins, tannins, alkaloids, amber and cork. Products derived from plants include soaps, shampoos, perfumes, cosmetics, paint, varnish, turpentine, rubber, latex, lubricants, linoleum, plastics, inks, and gums. Renewable fuels from plants include firewood, peat and other biofuels. The fossil fuels coal, petroleum and natural gas are derived from the remains of aquatic organisms including <b>phytoplankton</b> in geological time.|$|E
5|$|Salinity {{differences}} between the sections of the lake separated by the railroad causeway result in significantly different biota. A <b>phytoplankton</b> community dominated by green algae or cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) tint the water south of the causeway a greenish color. North of the causeway, the lake is dominated by Dunaliella salina, a species of algae which releases beta-carotene, and the bacteria-like haloarchaea, which together give the water an unusual reddish or purplish color, and the bacteria converts non-toxic mercury into toxic methyl mercury, which then flows into the Southern portion of the lake in a heavy brine layer through the causeway.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} marine animals exist and rely, {{directly}} or indirectly, on the <b>phytoplankton.</b> Antarctic sea life includes penguins, blue whales, orcas, colossal squids and fur seals. The emperor penguin {{is the only}} penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the Adélie penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin. The southern rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. King penguins, chinstrap penguins, and gentoo penguins also breed in the Antarctic.|$|E
5|$|The Muscat International Airport reopened {{after three}} days while Fujairah reopened on June 7 after it was closed the day before. The cyclone caused little impact to oil {{facilities}} along its path; after the initial price rises, oil dropped over USD2 per barrel as a result. Across the northern Arabian Sea, the passage of Gonu produced stronger winds and significant upwelling– an oceanographic phenomenon that involves {{the replacement of the}} nutrient-depleted surface water with deeper nutrient-rich water; the passage caused a significant increase in <b>phytoplankton.</b> Additionally, the cyclone delayed the arrival of the Indian Ocean south-west monsoon in the Western Ghats in India.|$|E
5|$|The ocean can be {{conceptualized}} as being divided into various zones, depending on depth, and {{presence or absence}} of sunlight. Nearly all life forms in the ocean depend on the photosynthetic activities of <b>phytoplankton</b> and other marine plants to convert carbon dioxide into organic carbon, which is the basic building block of organic matter. Photosynthesis in turn requires energy from sunlight to drive the chemical reactions that produce organic carbon.|$|E
5|$|A {{teaspoon}} of seawater contains about 50 million viruses. Most {{of these are}} bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals, and are in fact essential to the regulation of marine and freshwater ecosystems; however, they are also important mortality agents of <b>phytoplankton,</b> {{the base of the}} foodchain in aquatic environments. They infect and destroy bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, and {{are one of the most}} important mechanisms of recycling carbon and nutrient cycling in marine environments. The organic molecules released from the dead bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth, in a process known as the viral shunt. Viral activity may also affect the biological pump, the process whereby carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bivalves}} are filter feeders, {{using their}} gills to capture particulate food such as <b>phytoplankton</b> from the water. The protobranchs feed {{in a different}} way, scraping detritus from the seabed, {{and this may be}} the original mode of feeding used by all bivalves before the gills became adapted for filter feeding. These primitive bivalves hold on to the substratum with a pair of tentacles {{at the edge of the}} mouth, each of which has a single palp, or flap. The tentacles are covered in mucus, which traps the food, and cilia, which transport the particles back to the palps. These then sort the particles, rejecting those that are unsuitable or too large to digest, and conveying others to the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Most starfish embryos hatch at the blastula stage. The {{original}} ball {{of cells}} develops a lateral pouch, the archenteron. The entrance {{to this is}} known as the blastopore and it will later develop into the anus. Another invagination of the surface will fuse with the tip of the archenteron as the mouth while the interior section will become the gut. At the same time, a band of cilia develops on the exterior. This enlarges and extends around the surface and eventually onto two developing arm-like outgrowths. At this stage the larva is known as a bipinnaria. The cilia are used for locomotion and feeding, their rhythmic beat wafting <b>phytoplankton</b> towards the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning (PSP) {{is primarily}} {{caused by the}} consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins by feeding on toxic dinoflagellates, single-celled protists found naturally in the sea and inland waters. Saxitoxin is the most virulent of these. In mild cases, PSP causes tingling, numbness, sickness and diarrhoea. In more severe cases, {{the muscles of the}} chest wall may be affected leading to paralysis and even death. In 1937, researchers in California established the connection between blooms of these <b>phytoplankton</b> and PSP. The biotoxin remains potent even when the shellfish are well-cooked. In the United States, there is a regulatory limit of 80µg/g of saxitoxin equivalent in shellfish meat.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} oxygen present in {{seawater}} depends primarily upon its temperature and the photosynthetic organisms living in it, particularly algae, <b>phytoplankton,</b> and {{plants such as}} seagrass. During the day, their photosynthetic activity produces oxygen, which dissolves into the seawater and is used by marine animals. The water's oxygen saturation is lower during the night and much lower in the deep sea. Below a depth of about , there is insufficient light for photosynthesis and consequently little dissolved oxygen. Below this, anaerobic bacteria break down falling organic material, producing hydrogen sulfide (H₂S). It is projected that global warming will reduce oxygen both in surface and deep waters, due to oxygen's decreased solubility as temperatures increase and increased oceanic stratification.|$|E
25|$|At {{the base}} of food chains are the primary {{producers}}. In the ocean these primary producers are mainly a type of plankton, microscopic <b>phytoplankton</b> which drift in the water column. <b>Phytoplankton</b> need sunlight for photosynthesis to power carbon fixation, so they are mainly located in sunlit surface waters. <b>Phytoplankton</b> also need and rapidly use nutrients in the water column. The <b>phytoplankton</b> are eaten by zooplankton, which in turn are eaten by predatory zooplankton. Filter feeders then eat the plankton and larger predatory fish eat the filter feeders (see diagram at the right).|$|E
25|$|Primary {{production}} from <b>phytoplankton</b> {{is a function}} of two different factors: growth rates and accumulation (Fig. 1). Although the LSZ is a sink for high concentrations of nutrients from urban and agricultural sources, <b>phytoplankton</b> production rates are quite low. Nitrate is optimally used by <b>phytoplankton</b> for growth, but ammonium (largely derived from sewage outfalls) has a suppressive effect on growth rate. Thus, while not nutrient limited, <b>phytoplankton</b> tend to grow more slowly due to the kinds of nitrogen present. Another suppressive factor on growth rate is the high turbidity of the estuary, which limits the ability of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to penetrate beyond the top few centimeters of the water column. This limits <b>phytoplankton</b> photosynthesis to a relatively shallow photic zone. Thus, when the water column is stratified, turbidity is high, and ammonium is present, the growth rate of <b>phytoplankton</b> is typically suppressed.|$|E
25|$|Herbivory also removes <b>phytoplankton</b> {{from the}} water column. While the pelagic food web is based upon <b>phytoplankton</b> {{production}}, most of this production is diverted to the benthos via predation by the introduced Amur River clam (Corbula amurensis). Levels of <b>phytoplankton</b> biomass declined by {{an order of magnitude}} after the widespread introduction of C. amurensis in the mid-1980s, and have not rebounded.|$|E
25|$|Many {{single-celled}} organisms called <b>phytoplankton</b> live in {{oceans and}} lakes. When certain conditions are present, {{such as high}} nutrient or light levels, these organisms reproduce explosively. The resulting dense swarm of <b>phytoplankton</b> is called an algal bloom. Blooms can cover hundreds of square kilometres and are easily seen in satellite images. Individual <b>phytoplankton</b> rarely live {{more than a few}} days, but blooms can last weeks.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{production}} by <b>phytoplankton</b> fixes energy and key nutrients into a biologically available form (i.e., food), via photosynthesis. <b>Phytoplankton</b> production is largely structured by physical parameters: nutrient availability, sunlight, turbidity, and temperature.|$|E
25|$|The {{reduction}} of sea ice has boosted {{the productivity of}} <b>phytoplankton</b> by about twenty {{percent over the past}} thirty years. However, the effect on marine ecosystems is unclear, since the larger types of <b>phytoplankton,</b> which are the preferred food source of most zooplankton, do not appear to have increased as much as the smaller types. So far, Arctic <b>phytoplankton</b> have not {{had a significant impact on}} the global carbon cycle. In summer, the melt ponds on young and thin ice have allowed sunlight to penetrate the ice, in turn allowing <b>phytoplankton</b> to bloom in unexpected concentrations, although it is unknown just how long this phenomenon has been occurring.|$|E
25|$|The second {{trophic level}} (primary consumers) is {{occupied}} by zooplankton which feed off the <b>phytoplankton.</b> Together with the <b>phytoplankton,</b> they form {{the base of the}} food pyramid that supports most of the world's great fishing grounds. Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the <b>phytoplankton</b> in oceanic surface waters, and include tiny crustaceans, and fish larvae and fry (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are filter feeders, and they use appendages to strain the <b>phytoplankton</b> in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like <b>phytoplankton,</b> they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.|$|E
25|$|The Arctic Ocean has {{relatively}} little plant life except for <b>phytoplankton.</b> <b>Phytoplankton</b> are {{a crucial part}} of the ocean and there are massive amounts of them in the Arctic, where they feed on nutrients from rivers and the currents of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. During summer, the sun is out day and night, thus enabling the <b>phytoplankton</b> to photosynthesize {{for long periods of time}} and reproduce quickly. However, the reverse is true in winter when they struggle to get enough light to survive.|$|E
25|$|In North American lakes, piscivorous {{fish can}} {{dramatically}} reduce populations of zooplanktivorous fish, zooplanktivorous fish can dramatically alter freshwater zooplankton communities, and zooplankton grazing can in turn have large impacts on <b>phytoplankton</b> communities. Removal of piscivorous fish can change lake water from clear to green by allowing <b>phytoplankton</b> to flourish.|$|E
25|$|Iron {{fertilization}} of {{the ocean}} could stimulate photosynthesis in <b>phytoplankton</b> (see Iron hypothesis). The <b>phytoplankton</b> would convert the ocean's dissolved carbon dioxide into carbohydrate and oxygen gas, some of which would sink into the deeper ocean before oxidizing. More than a dozen open-sea experiments confirmed that adding iron to the ocean increases photosynthesis in <b>phytoplankton</b> by up to 30 times. While this approach has been proposed as a potential solution to the ocean acidification problem, mitigation of surface ocean acidification might increase acidification in the less-inhabited deep ocean.|$|E
25|$|Together, <b>phytoplankton</b> and {{zooplankton}} make {{up most of}} the plankton in the sea. Plankton is {{the term}} applied to any small drifting organisms that float in the sea (Greek planktos = wanderer or drifter). By definition, organisms classified as plankton are unable to swim against ocean currents; they cannot resist the ambient current and control their position. In ocean environments, the first two trophic levels are occupied mainly by plankton. Plankton are divided into producers and consumers. The producers are the <b>phytoplankton</b> (Greek phyton = plant) and the consumers, who eat the <b>phytoplankton,</b> are the zooplankton (Greek zoon = animal).|$|E
25|$|The <b>phytoplankton</b> of {{the lake}} is {{predominantly}} Microcystis aeruginosa and Ceratium hirundinella.|$|E
25|$|Sulfate aerosol (SO42− and {{methanesulfonic acid}} droplets) act as CCNs. These sulfate {{aerosols}} form partly from the dimethyl sulfide (DMS) produced by <b>phytoplankton</b> {{in the open}} ocean. Large algal blooms in ocean surface waters occur {{in a wide range}} of latitudes and contribute considerable DMS into the atmosphere to act as nuclei. The idea that an increase in global temperature would also increase <b>phytoplankton</b> activity and therefore CCN numbers was seen as a possible natural phenomenon that would counteract climate change. An increase of <b>phytoplankton</b> has been observed by scientists in certain areas but the causes are unclear.|$|E
25|$|High {{residence}} time {{of water in}} the estuary tends to allow <b>phytoplankton</b> biomass to accumulate, increasing density, while low {{residence time}} removes <b>phytoplankton</b> from the estuary. The latter is typical of the main channels of the estuary during periods of high flow, when surface waters tend to flush particles and plankton downstream.|$|E
25|$|There are {{records of}} 68 taxa of zooplankton, in {{addition}} to <b>phytoplankton,</b> consolidated and non-consolidated benthos.|$|E
