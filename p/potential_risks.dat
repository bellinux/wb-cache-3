5|$|At {{low tide}} {{extensive}} areas of mudflats (the Steart and the Berrow Flats) are exposed, providing important feeding and over-wintering grounds for waders (shorebirds). Invertebrate fauna including six nationally rare species and eighteen nationally scarce species {{can be found}} in the ditches and ponds around the shores. Consequently, Bridgwater Bay is a National Nature Reserve, and is managed by Natural England.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1921 season, Allen {{was invited}} to play {{first-class}} cricket as an amateur for Middlesex, for whom he qualified by residence. Allen believed that Pelham Warner, who often supported young Middlesex cricketers, encouraged his selection by the club, despite the <b>potential</b> <b>risks</b> to the team's position in the County Championship from playing an inexperienced cricketer. Allen made his first-class debut against Somerset on 21 August 1921 and made one other appearance that season without achieving much in either match.|$|E
5|$|A {{decision}} by the US Army in the mid-2000s to replace all of its CH-47Ds with new-build CH-47Fs by 2017 endangered {{the viability of the}} Australian Chinooks. This was because the Australian Army's arrangements for the logistical support of its small fleet of CH-47Ds were heavily leveraged off those for the US Army's large fleet. In response, the Australian Army also established a project to acquire CH-47F Chinooks to replace its CH-47Ds in the mid-2000s. The Australian Government provided initial approval for a CH-47F purchase in September 2007. As part of this decision, the Government chose to procure the helicopters through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales program to minimise <b>potential</b> <b>risks</b> to the schedule and cost of the project.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we carry}} {{out a series of}} {{quantitative}} analysis with an aim to provide a deeper insight about the adjusted excess returns of hedge fund indices and the <b>potential</b> <b>risk</b> factors that influence the strategies. In order to explore what potential explanatory factors involved in hedge fund, we extract eight hedge fund style indices from each of two famous database during the period from January 2001 to June 2010, and select typical <b>potential</b> <b>risk</b> factors which included common market index factors, Primitive trend-following (PTF) factors based on look back straddle, Fama-French and Carhart factors, commodity factor, Credit spread and additional trading strategy factors. Stepwise regressions will be applied to extract dominate <b>potential</b> <b>risk</b> factors due to that researchers generally accepted that different hedge fund style indices may have different <b>potential</b> <b>risk</b> factor. In terms of the results of correlation and regression analysis, the relationship between hedge fund indices and <b>potential</b> <b>risk</b> factors will be finally made clear. As a result, these selected <b>potential</b> <b>risk</b> factors can explain a significant proportion of the excess returns on hedge fund indices...|$|R

The College position is that it is untenable to recommend the procedure. The procedure is also not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or the American Medical Association, and no peer-reviewed studies have been accepted to account for either safety or effectiveness of this treatment.|$|E

These opponents assert that the LHC experiments have the potential to create low velocity micro black holes that could grow in mass or release dangerous radiation leading to doomsday scenarios, such as the destruction of the Earth. Other claimed <b>potential</b> <b>risks</b> include the creation of theoretical particles called strangelets, magnetic monopoles and vacuum bubbles.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, an {{independent}} Health Advisory Panel - appointed by then-Governor Roy Romer - oversaw {{a series of}} reports, called the Historical Public Exposure Studies. The 12-member Health Advisory Panel included multiple medical doctors, scientists, PhDs, and local officials. The Rocky Flats Historical Public Exposure Studies involved nine years of research. The Studies had three main objectives: (1) create a public record of plant operations and accidents that contributed to contaminant releases from the Rocky Flats Plant between 1952 and 1989; (2) assess public exposures to contaminants and <b>potential</b> <b>risks</b> from past releases; and, (3) determine the need for future studies. The Studies' research included identification and assessment of chemicals and radioactive materials from past releases; estimates of risk to residents living or working in surrounding communities during the Plant's operation from 1952 to 1989; an evaluation of possible exposure pathways; and, dose assessments for historical releases.|$|E

40|$|In this {{controlled}} {{before-after study}} {{the effect of}} improvements, derived from Lean Six Sigma strategy, on parenteral medication administration errors and the <b>potential</b> <b>risk</b> of harm was determined. During baseline measurement, on control versus intervention ward, at least one administration error occurred in 14 (74 %) and 6 (46 %) administrations with <b>potential</b> <b>risk</b> of harm in 6 (32 %) and 1 (8 %) administrations. Most administration errors with high <b>potential</b> <b>risk</b> of harm occurred in bolus injections: 8 (57 %) versus 2 (67 %) bolus injections were injected too fast with a <b>potential</b> <b>risk</b> of harm in 6 (43 %) and 1 (33 %) bolus injections on control and intervention ward. Implemented improvement strategies, based on major causes of too fast administration of bolus injections, were: Substitution of bolus injections by infusions, education, availability of administration information and drug round tabards. Post intervention, on the control ward in 76 (76 %) administrations at least one error was made (RR 1. 03; CI 95 : 0. 77 - 1. 38), with a <b>potential</b> <b>risk</b> of harm in 14 (14 %) administrations (RR 0. 45; CI 95 : 0. 20 - 1. 02). In 40 (68 %) administrations on the intervention ward at least one error occurred (RR 1. 47; CI 95 : 0. 80 - 2. 71) but no administrations were associated with a <b>potential</b> <b>risk</b> of harm. A shift in wrong duration administration errors from bolus injections to infusions, with a reduction of <b>potential</b> <b>risk</b> of harm, seems to have occurred on the intervention ward. Although data are insufficient to prove an effect, Lean Six Sigma was experienced as a suitable strategy to select tailored improvements.

The result shows that the <b>potential</b> ecological <b>risk</b> in Jilin section, the greatest contribution to the <b>potential</b> <b>risk</b> is the toxic organic pollutants and heavy metals in sediments; the <b>potential</b> ecological <b>risk</b> in Songyuan section is slightly higher than that in front of the Fengman dam, the greatest contribution to the <b>potential</b> <b>risk</b> in Songyuan section is water pollution...|$|R
