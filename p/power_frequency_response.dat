This methodology {{is based on}} an energy field formulation of the vibroacoustic problem. In this energy-field formulation, the vibroacoustic system is modelled using statistical averaging over independent realizations of a probabilistic vibroacoustic model. In the vibroacoustic energy model, excitations are represented in terms of input power, observations are represented in terms of response power, and the propagation between excitation and observation points is represented by a set of <b>Power</b> <b>Frequency</b> <b>Response</b> Functions (PFRF). When statistically averaged, these parameters are linearly related to form the equation of the vibroacoustic energy model. It is shown that above a given frequency the <b>power</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> functions are much less dependant, on the direction or on the precise location of the excitation or the observation, than the classical frequency response functions.

40|$|The authors {{present a}} system {{performance}} analysis of an optical single sideband system (OSSB) when phase errors {{occur in the}} modulating signal driving the dual-arm Mach–Zehnder modulator (MZM). The performance is evaluated {{in terms of the}} optical sideband suppression, received subcarrier <b>power,</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response,</b> and power-penalty measurements. Experiments were carried out and a mathematical model of the OSSB system, incorporating the phase error, was developed. Both the theoretical and experimental results show that, although optical sideband suppression reduces with phase errors, the received subcarrier power can increase as high as 3 dB for positive phase errors. However, for transmission over longer fiber, the frequency response of the OSSB system is not only dependent on the phase error, but also on the phase shift due to chromatic dispersion (CD). The power penalty was found to be dependent on the frequency response of the OSSB system. At any frequency-response null point, the power-penalty slope is reversed as the received subcarrier power is reduced. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This paper presents an analytical method for modelling an electromechanical piezoelectric bimorph beam with tip mass under two input base transverse and longitudinal excitations. The Euler–Bernoulli beam equations {{were used to}} model the piezoelectric bimorph beam. The polarity-electric field of the piezoelectric element is excited by the strain field caused by base input excitation, resulting in electrical charge. The governing electromechanical dynamic equations were derived analytically using the weak form of the Hamiltonian principle to obtain the constitutive equations. Three constitutive electromechanical dynamic equations based on independent coefficients of virtual displacement vectors were formulated and then further modelled using the normalised Ritz eigenfunction series. The electromechanical formulations include both the series and parallel connections of the piezoelectric bimorph. The multi-mode frequency response functions (FRFs) under varying electrical load resistance were formulated using Laplace transformation for the multi-input mechanical vibrations to provide the multi-output dynamic displacement, velocity, voltage, current and power. The experimental and theoretical validations reduced for the single mode system were shown to provide reasonable predictions.
