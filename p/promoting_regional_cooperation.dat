40|$|Special {{districts have}} been seen as a formalized {{institution}} for <b>promoting</b> <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation.</b> They allow boundary design to the scale of public problems and may produce greater efficiency in the marketplace for local public goods. Many scholars also have highlighted the flexibility of special district boundaries once established, arguing that this flexibility allows for governance that is more adaptable to changing resource constraints and patterns of demand. While flexible boundaries might promote special districts ability to internalize spillovers while acting alone, it might impede more ad hoc forms of cooperation among localities. This paper presents evidence that boundary change is a substitute strategy to the establishment of intergovernmental agreements for the resolution of interlocal policy challenges. By allowing special districts with slack resources to expand into new territory, state rules that promote boundary flexibility reduce the likelihood that districts will develop contracting relationships to share their surplus capacity with neighboring governments. The results demonstrate the importance of considering the entire package of coordinating institutions that are available in a given region when we examine ho...|$|E

40|$|Nepal's lackluster {{economic}} performance during the post-conflict period (that is, after November 2006) {{has been driven}} by remittances from the export of labor services and the improved performance of the agricultural sector, which is still very much weather dependent. The authors make the case for a connectivity-driven development strategy for the country. They argue that improved connectivity within Nepal and cross-border connectivity with its neighbors in South Asia, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the People's Republic of China (PRC) that are converting Nepal from a landlocked into a land-linked state, could be important "engines of growth" for the country. It is argued that such a development strategy is not a new one for Nepal as in the past the country was strategically located on the Southwestern Silk Road (SSR). A number of factors have revived the case for making Nepal a land-linked state in Asia. Nepal has adopted a multi-track approach to <b>promoting</b> <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> and integration in connectivity with its neighbors. But a lot more needs to be done, especially {{in the context of the}} difficult political situation in the country, and donors have an important role to play in this regard.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the state to state level of relations, economic cooperation and regionalism is showing marked progress below the central government level in Northeast Asia. Subnational authorities are linking up to form networks of bilateral and multilateral relationship of increasing scope and density in {{a broad range of}} activities, especially in the areas of trade and investment. The subnational authorities most active in <b>promoting</b> <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> tend to be those in the NET (natural economic territories) around the rim of Japan Sea. The motivating factors behind the Japanese subnational actors participating in the Japan Sea process are the desire to escape economic backwardness and lack of faith in solutions coming from the central government. The strategic objectives of these authorities is to strengthen its export orientations, developing production and services targeting overseas markets. Becoming an intermediary for expanded trade between the developed Pacific side of Japan and the Northeast Asia NET in {{the opposite side of the}} Japan Sea is another important reason for active involvement in the process. The subnational actors, despite lack of support from Tokyo, are making striking advances in the key dimensions used to measure regionalism, using their own limited resources and by relying on allies in the private sector both at the local and national level. Characterizing such Japanese approach to building international cooperation and promoting Northeast Asian regionalism among subnational actors is the aim of this analysis. ...|$|E

The present activities in this endeavour, challenges and the approaches for way forward are discussed in this paper. Climate change, water and poverty are the three strategic thrust areas of ICIMOD with its activities focusing on addressing the needs to investigate, to develop adaptation mechanisms and to prepare the communities and nations of the HKH to successfully manage {{the changes that are}} taking place. Many of these issues are of transboundary concern and an improved understanding of key components of these issues is necessary to effectively address them. Geographic information has been a common denominator for studies in many areas of concern. However, when it comes to basic data and information, the HKH region is still very poor. There have been initiatives at the global level for generating core geographic datasets which are required for multiple applications. Keeping in view that the global datasets lack the required details to define the mountain geography and ecosystems of the HKH and the national datasets are fragmented and poorly maintained, there is a strong need to develop datasets that are useful for regional applications. ICIMOD has been working on <b>promoting</b> <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> through interdisciplinary and cross sectoral partnerships. In this respect, ICIMOD’s approach towards the RSDI is to develop basic data layers at regional scale and a common framework for sharing data and knowledgebase.

The long term goal of having a RSDI is to develop networks of institutions linked by intra-regiona...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{seeks to}} {{understand}} why in the post-Cold War era regionalism in Southeastern Europe has been largely ineffective. First, it examines the theoretical preconditions {{for the emergence of}} the phenomenon. It finds that two separate levels of analysis exist for explaining its sources, namely the international - divided between rationalist and reflectivist schools - and the domestic. Rationalist schools of thought are arranged along a continuum between those focusing on sources of regionalism external (systemic) and internal to regions. Subsequently, the research project provides a historical perspective of cooperation in Southeastern Europe. It finds that in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, regional schemes did not succeed because of the fragmentory role of external factors - namely the intervention in descending order of the Great Powers, Germany and the Superpowers - as well as Balkan nationalisms. The thesis argues that in the post-Cold War era regional cooperation initiatives, such as the SEECP, the Royaumont Proces, SECI and the SPSEE, have also been ineffective due to external and domestic reasons. On the one hand, while <b>promoting</b> <b>regional</b> <b>cooperation</b> initiatives in Southeastern Europe, the EU has at the same time pursued differentiated integration and bilateral policies with Balkan states which further contribute to the region's heterogeneity and generate centrifugal dynamics. On the other hand, intra-national prerequisites for the emergence of regionalism are absent. These include the retarded state and nation-building process of Yugoslav successor states and entities as well as domestic economic conditions related to the delayed transition in the 1990 s. The methodology of the study places the thesis within the literature of International Relations. Systemic theories and domestic political and economic reasons are used to explain the failure of regional cooperation in Southeastern Europe. The research project introduces the concept of 'stateness' - generally referred to in the democratisation literature as state and nation-building or 'third transition'- to the domestic explanations for the lack of regionalism as well as a neo-liberal aspect to the traditional state-centric external approach to regional cooperation...|$|E
