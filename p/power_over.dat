5|$|A key {{strategy}} was {{the establishment of}} colonial towns across the territories that underwent the process of conquest and colonisation; {{they were used to}} project Spanish <b>power</b> <b>over</b> the surrounding countryside. The Spanish were particularly horrified by the Mesoamerican religious practice of human sacrifice, prompting them to attempt to eradicate the native religion.|$|E
5|$|According to beliefs {{derived from}} fusui (feng shui), the fox's <b>power</b> <b>over</b> evil {{is such that}} a mere statue of a fox can dispel the evil kimon, or energy, that flows from the northeast.

5|$|Power: A New Social Analysis by Bertrand Russell (1st imp. London 1938, Allen & Unwin, 328 pp.) {{is a work}} {{in social}} {{philosophy}} written by Bertrand Russell.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1914, the British Admiral Percy Scott {{predicted}} that battleships {{would soon be}} made irrelevant by aircraft. By the end of World War I, aircraft had successfully adopted the torpedo as a weapon. In 1921 the Italian general and air theorist Giulio Douhet completed a hugely influential treatise on strategic bombing titled The Command of the Air, which foresaw the dominance of air <b>power</b> <b>over</b> naval units.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun's basic {{concern for}} {{protecting}} the diversity of minority interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science—the idea of a concurrent majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority.

5|$|During the Flavian dynasty, the princes of the Iazyges {{were trained}} in the Roman army, officially as an honor, but in reality serving as a hostage, because the kings held {{absolute}} <b>power</b> <b>over</b> the Iazyges.

5|$|Edward was {{determined}} to prevent any further rebellion in North Wales and set about building a sequence of new castles and walled towns, replacing the old Welsh administrative system with a new principality governed from Caernarfon. Dolbadarn was no longer relevant and within two years timber from the castle was {{being used by the}} Normans for the construction of Caernarfon Castle. This was both a practical and a symbolic action, demonstrating Norman <b>power</b> <b>over</b> {{one of the most important}} possessions of the Welsh princes.|$|E

This secret service was overseen by the Directorate of Ceremonial, hence this state organ's often totalitarian affiliation. Eunuchs had ranks that were equivalent to civil service ranks, only theirs had four grades instead of nine.|$|E

5|$|Feminist {{literary}} critics see the poem as portraying women's ultimate <b>power</b> <b>over</b> men. Morgan le Fay and Bertilak's wife, for example, {{are the most}} powerful characters in the poem—Morgan especially, as she begins the game by enchanting the Green Knight. The girdle and Gawain's scar {{can be seen as}} symbols of feminine power, each of them diminishing Gawain's masculinity. Gawain's misogynist passage, in which he blames all of his troubles on women and lists the many men who have fallen prey to women's wiles, further supports the feminist view of ultimate female power in the poem.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was born}} in France at Le Mans on 5 March 1133, the eldest child of the Empress Matilda and her second husband, Geoffrey the Fair, Count of Anjou. The French county of Anjou was formed in the 10th century and the Angevin rulers {{attempted}} for several centuries to extend their influence and power across France through careful marriages and political alliances. In theory, the county answered to the French king, but royal <b>power</b> <b>over</b> Anjou weakened during the 11th century and the county became largely autonomous.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, a {{currency}} reform introduced a bimetallic standard, which {{went into effect}} in July 1883. Unlike many precious metal standards the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the government, since, having no institutional <b>power</b> <b>over</b> the monetary system, there was little they could do to prevent it.|$|E
