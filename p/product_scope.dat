40|$|Firms {{differ in}} their {{integration}} capability, which {{is the ability to}} absorb and manage businesses on a continuing basis. We expect integration capability heterogeneity to influence acquisition strategy by profit-seeking firms, affecting both their propensity to acquire and the types of businesses that they target. We argue that a firm’s integration capability increases with its <b>product</b> line <b>scope</b> and test two hypotheses: (1) firms with greater existing <b>product</b> line <b>scope</b> {{are more likely to be}} acquirers; and (2) firms with greater <b>product</b> line <b>scope</b> are more likely to purchase product lines that they already operate. Data from the U. S. medical sector between 1978 and 1995 support hypothesis 1. We then find that all firms tended to purchase product lines that they did not previously operate, but, consistent with hypothesis 2, that firms with greater <b>product</b> line <b>scope</b> made acquisitions that had greater overlap with their existing product lines. The results are analogous with the biological observation that the most successful predators are better able to target desirable prey as well as being better able to overpower the prey they target...|$|R

This planning phase, where the product line's characteristics are determined, is called <b>scoping.</b> <b>Product</b> line <b>scoping</b> {{is the process}} of identifying and delimiting capabilities (products and features) and areas (subdomains and existing assets) of the product line where investment into reuse would be economical and beneficial to product development.

The approach builds on guidelines and patterns from collaboration engineering and practices of existing scoping approaches.

Technological progress generally increases consumer surplus and lowers firm profits. If entry is threatened bilaterally across two converging markets, both either accommodate entrants from the rival market, or both deter entry; continuous progress in technology can cause equilibria shifts, leading to discontinuous and radical redistribution of surplus across markets. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Product</b> line <b>scoping</b> is a {{critical}} activity because it elicits the common realms upon which the different products of a product line can be optimally engineered with respect to economies of scope. This, in turn, upper bounds the overall economic benefits that can be accrued from product line based development. Inherently, <b>product</b> line <b>scoping</b> is difficult because {{of the complexity of}} the factors that must be taken into account. Many are not known a priori. Traditional scoping approaches (from domain engineering) have focused on the notion of application domains. However, domains proved difficult to optimally scope and engineer from an enterprise standpoint because a domain captures extraneous elements that are of no interest to an enterprise which focuses on particular products, whether existing, under development, or anticipated. Hence, the domain view provides a flawed economic basis for making a scoping decision. We introduce in this paper PuLSE-Eco, a technique especially developed to address the aforementioned issues. Its main characteristics are: a complete product-centric orientation done via product maps, the separation of concerns achieved through the definition and operationalization of strategical business objectives, and last, diverse types of analyses performed upon <b>product</b> maps allowing <b>scoping</b> decisions based on these objectives. We illustrate the technique with a running example...|$|R
