5|$|The {{pulsations}} {{result from}} a process called the κ-mechanism. A part of the star's outer atmosphere becomes optically thick due to partial ionization of certain elements. When these atoms lose an electron, the likelihood that they will absorb energy increases. This results {{in an increase in}} temperature that causes the atmosphere to expand. The inflated atmosphere becomes less ionized and loses energy, causing it to cool and shrink back down again. The result of this cycle is a periodic <b>pulsation</b> of the atmosphere and a matching variation of the luminosity.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{physician}} Galen (2nd century CE) knew {{blood vessels}} carried blood and identified venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions. Galen, noting the heart as the hottest organ in the body, {{concluded that it}} provided heat to the body. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood moved by the <b>pulsation</b> of the arteries themselves. Galen believed the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from the left ventricle to the right through 'pores' between the ventricles. Air from the lungs passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery {{to the left side}} of the heart and created arterial blood.|$|E
5|$|Like {{nearly all}} extrasolar planets {{discovered}} prior to 2008, PSR B1620-26 b was originally detected through the Doppler shifts its orbit induces on {{radiation from the}} star it orbits (in this case, changes in the apparent <b>pulsation</b> period of the pulsar). In the early 1990s, a group of astronomers led by Donald Backer, who were studying {{what they thought was}} a binary pulsar, determined that a third object was needed to explain the observed Doppler shifts. Within a few years, the gravitational effects of the planet on the orbit of the pulsar and white dwarf had been measured, giving an estimate of the mass of the third object that was too small for it to be a star. The conclusion that the third object was a planet was announced by Stephen Thorsett and his collaborators in 1993.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: During sessile droplet evaporation, {{studies with}} IR {{thermography}} and shadowgraphs have indicated temper-ature <b>pulsations.</b> We confirm those observations with micro-thermocouples, but microthermocouples also indicate temper-ature <b>pulsations</b> {{in the atmosphere}} of the droplet. The pressure in this atmosphere pulsated as well and was correlated with the temperature <b>pulsations</b> in the droplet. Also, we find that if a droplet evaporates into its own vapor, there are no temperature or pressure <b>pulsations.</b> The <b>pulsations</b> occur only if the droplet evaporates into an atmosphere with a component having a heat of solution with the droplet when it adsorbs−absorbs. None of the currently proposed mechanisms for the temperature <b>pulsations</b> provide an explanation for the coupling between the temperature <b>pulsations</b> in the droplet and the vapor-phase pressure <b>pulsations,</b> and for the absence of the <b>pulsations</b> when the system is single-component. As a mechanism for the <b>pulsations,</b> we propose that when a droplet is exposed to an atmosphere containing a component that has a heat of solution with the droplet, energy will be released from adsorption−absorption. This energy will cause <b>pulsations</b> in the evaporation flux...|$|R

5|$|The star HR 6958, {{also known}} as MV Serpentis, is an Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum {{variable}} that is faintly {{visible to the naked}} eye. The star's metal abundance is ten times higher than the Sun for most metals at the iron peak and up to 1,000 times more for heavier elements. It has also been found to contain excess silicon. Barely {{visible to the naked eye}} is HD 172365, a likely post-blue straggler in the open cluster IC 4756 that contains a large excess of lithium. HD 172189, also located in IC 4756, is an Algol variable eclipsing binary with a 5.70 day period. The primary star in the system is also a Delta Scuti variable, undergoing multiple <b>pulsation</b> frequencies, which, combined with the eclipses, causes the system to vary by around a tenth of a magnitude.|$|E
25|$|In the {{cardiovascular}} system, the <b>pulsation</b> frequency decreases as {{the blood is}} distanced from the origin of <b>pulsation,</b> the heart. However, the Womersley number, like many characteristic numbers, defines a system by order of magnitude (OoM). The <b>pulsation</b> frequency maintains a single OoM throughout the body (<1 s^-1) and is square rooted in the Womersley equation, reducing the OoM further.

25|$|The roAp stars {{oscillate}} in high-overtone, low-degree, non-radial pressure modes. The usual {{model that}} is used to explain the behavior of these pulsations is the oblique pulsator model. In this model the axis of <b>pulsation</b> is aligned with the magnetic axis, which can lead to modulation of the amplitude of the <b>pulsation,</b> depending on the orientation of the axis to the line of sight, as it varies with rotation. The apparent link between the magnetic axis and the <b>pulsation</b> axis gives clues {{to the nature of the}} driving mechanism of the pulsations. As the roAp stars seem to occupy the main sequence end of the δ Scuti instability strip, it has been suggested that the driving mechanism may be similar, i.e. the opacity mechanism operating in the Hydrogen ionization zone. No standard <b>pulsation</b> model can be made to excite oscillations of the roAp type using the opacity mechanism. As the magnetic field appears to be important, research has taken this into account in deriving non-standard <b>pulsation</b> models. It has been suggested that the modes are driven by the suppression of convection by the strong magnetic field near the magnetic poles of these stars which would account for the alignment of the <b>pulsation</b> axis with the magnetic axis. An instability strip for the roAp stars has been calculated which agreed with the positions on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram of the roAp stars discovered up to that point, but predicted the existence of longer period pulsators amongst the more evolved roAp stars. Such a pulsator was discovered in HD 177765 which has the longest <b>pulsation</b> period of any roAp star at 23.6 minutes.|$|E

3000|$|The {{alternative}} generation {{mechanism for}} mid-latitude Pi 2 <b>pulsations</b> is a BBF-driven model, wherein periodical BBFs propagating earthward from the magnetotail cause periodic pressure pulses {{in the inner}} magnetosphere and generate Pi 2 <b>pulsations</b> on the ground. If BBFs generate Pi 2 <b>pulsations,</b> both the waveform and the frequency content should be similar between Pi 2 <b>pulsations</b> in the plasma flow data in the magnetotail on the nightside and ground magnetometer data on the flankside (Kepko and Kivelson 1999; Kepko et al. 2001). However, in this study, we could not confirm that the Pi 2 <b>pulsations</b> were generated by BBFs {{because there were no}} observations in the magnetotail.

25|$|Lord Kelvin (1871) and Carl Anton Bjerknes (1871) {{assumed that}} all bodies pulsate in the aether.

25|$|A {{group of}} EVs and HEVs during their {{charging}} process draw very high current {{for a short}} duration of time which creates power <b>pulsation</b> on the grid. Power <b>pulsation</b> not only reduces {{the efficiency of the}} grid and cause voltage drop in the common coupling bus, but it can cause considerable frequency fluctuation in the entire system. To overcome this problem, supercapacitors can be implemented as an interface between the charging station and the grid to buffer the grid from the high pulse power drawn from the charging station.|$|E
25|$|Most roAp {{stars have}} been {{discovered}} using small telescopes to observe the small changes in amplitude caused by the <b>pulsation</b> of the star, however {{it is also possible}} to observe such pulsations by measuring the variations in radial velocity of sensitive lines, such as Neodymium or Praseodymium. Some lines are not seen to pulsate, such as Iron. It is thought that the pulsations are of highest amplitude high in the atmospheres of these stars, where the density is lower. As a result, the spectral lines that are formed by elements that are radiatively levitated high in the atmosphere are likely to be most sensitive to measuring the <b>pulsation,</b> whereas the lines of elements such as Iron, which gravitationally settle, are not expected to exhibit radial velocity variations.|$|E
