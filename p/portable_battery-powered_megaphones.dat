40|$|The use of multi-sensing {{portable}} analysers is {{of increasing}} importance for many applications. This thesis {{reports on the}} development of new <b>portable</b> <b>battery-powered</b> gas analysers suitable for remote site monitoring that can utilise a range of Taguchi tin-oxide sensors as detectors. Two main designs were developed and evaluated for a variety of applications employing head-space analysis. A portable analyser employing the TGS 812 and TGS 824 Taguchi gas sensors was built in flow-through arrangements. The performance of the gas analyser was evaluated in terms of reproducibility, stability and sensitivity and was used to determine the ethanol content in various commercial beer and wine samples. The adsorption response mechanism of the tin-oxide gas sensors was also investigated using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model and this model was validated by determining the ethanol content of beer and wine samples. A <b>portable,</b> <b>battery-powered,</b> multi-sensor gas analyser, containing six different Taguchi tin-oxide semiconductors was developed and evaluated. The performance of the <b>portable,</b> <b>battery-powered,</b> multi-sensor gas analyser was evaluated in terms of stability, sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility. The portable multi-sensor gas analyser was used to determine the ethanol content in various beer samples employing the Langmuir isotherm mentioned above. The <b>portable</b> <b>battery-powered</b> multi-sensor gas analyser mentioned above was used together with back-propagation artificial neural networks and applied to discriminate between beer brands, grades of olive oils, as well as the estimation of the age of olive oil samples...|$|R

50|$|Field {{recording}} {{often involves}} {{the capture of}} ambient noises that are low level and complex, and, in response, the requirements from the field recordist have often pushed the technical limits of recording equipment, that is, demanding low noise and extended frequency response in a <b>portable,</b> <b>battery-powered</b> unit. For this reason, field recordists have favoured high-quality (usually professional) recorders, microphones, and microphone pre-amplifiers. The history of the equipment used in this area closely tracks the development of professional portable audio recording technology.|$|R

50|$|A fixed {{phone line}} (a line {{that is not}} a mobile phone line) can be {{hard-wired}} or cordless and typically refers to the operation of wireless devices or systems in fixed locations such as homes.

40|$|Summary. Polyclonal {{antibodies}} against {{luteinizing hormone}} in dromedary (camLH) {{were raised in}} a rabbit and enabled the development of homologous immunoassays(radioimmunoassay, competitive enzymeimmunoassay (EIA) and sandwich EIA) for the measurement of circulating camLH in plasma. These assays were highly specific for camLH since neither dromedary follicle-stimulating hormone, growth hormone nor prolactin cross-reacted significantly. The lowest detection limit (0 =. 8 ng/ml) was obtained with the sandwich EIA. In addition to its high specificity and sensitivity, this method does not require radiolabelled molecules or expensive laboratory facilities. It can be performed in the field using a <b>portable,</b> <b>battery-powered</b> plate reader...|$|R

25|$|Two {{dimensional}} imaging {{can provide}} a cross-sectional view along a single plane of all four chambers of the heart, and therefore, unlike Doppler, which assesses blood prior to primary filtration by the lungs, can also assess blood which will be circulated systemically.

Transthoracic echocardiography is suitable for the sampling used in decompression studies to identify highly reflective gas bubbles. Detection of venous gas bubbles by ultrasound imaging is a sensitive, but not specific, predictor of adverse effects of decompression, similar to the published relationship between Doppler detected bubbles and decompression sickness.|$|R
