However, although Trump received 23 votes in the district during the 2016 Republican primary, signifying the most votes of any Republican candidate there, there were 67 votes for his opponent Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary. In 2016, within the precinct that contained Trump Tower, 200 <b>people</b> <b>voted</b> for Clinton as opposed to 95 for Trump.|$|E
5|$|Of the Northern states, Harrison {{lost only}} Illinois and New Hampshire; {{he won his}} home state of Ohio, and also his home county (Hamilton). Voters in the Kentucky {{district}} Johnson once represented in the House of Representatives had backed Van Buren by 1,600 votes in 1836, but favored Harrison by 251 votes in 1840. Both major parties saw an increase in vote, in part because 51 percent more <b>people</b> <b>voted</b> in 1840 than in 1836. The Democrats alleged that Harrison had won the popular vote with bribed and ineligible voters; the Whigs responded by accusing their rivals of being unwilling to accept the will of the people.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, the ARF {{announced}} that it would nominate its own candidate to run for president of Armenia in the February 2008 presidential election. In an innovation on November 24–25, 2007, the ARF conducted a non-binding Armenia-wide primary election. They invited the public to vote to advise the party which of two candidates, Vahan Hovhannisyan and Armen Rustamyan, they should formally nominate for president of Armenia in the subsequent official election. What characterized it as a primary instead of a standard opinion poll was that the public knew of the primary in advance, all eligible voters were invited, and the voting was by secret ballot. Nearly 300,000 <b>people</b> <b>voted</b> in makeshift tents and mobile ballot boxes. Vahan Hovhannisyan received the most votes and was subsequently nominated for the presidential election by the ARF Supreme Council in a secret ballot. In the presidential election, Hovhannisyan placed fourth with 6.2% of the vote. In 2008, ARF re-joined the ruling political coalition in Armenia and supported strong police actions during the 2008 Armenian presidential election protests that led to ten deaths.|$|E

5|$|The current 500 {{members of}} the National Assembly were elected during the 2011 {{parliamentary}} election, {{and they have a}} five-year term. Despite foreign criticism, it is generally believed that the National Assembly has become more powerful in recent years. The last election was held, according to the authorities, in a democratic, fair, lawful and safe manner and was considered a success. Voter turnout was 99.51 percent; nearly 62 million <b>people</b> <b>voted.</b> In their respective constituencies, Nguyễn Phú Trọng, the General Secretary, was elected to the National Assembly with 85.63 percent of the votes, Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng was elected with 95.38 percent and President Trương Tấn Sang was elected with 80.19 percent. Outside the ruling troika, it was Nguyễn Xuân Phúc, the Chairman of the Government Office, who was elected with the highest margin, with 94.59 percent of the votes. The number of self-nominated candidates was four times higher than the previous election. Fifteen out of the 182 candidates nominated by the central government and the central party leadership were defeated in the elections. Lê Thị Thu Ba, a member of the Party's Central Committee and Chairman of the Committee of Law during the 12th National Assembly (2007–2011), was not re-elected to the National Assembly. Several capitalists were elected to the assembly, but due to the socialist ideology of the state, they are not allowed to sit on the assembly's Committee on Economy and Budget.|$|E
5|$|Ukrainian {{independence}} {{was confirmed by}} a referendum held on 1 December 1991. In this referendum, 54% of Crimean voters supported independence from the Soviet Union. This {{was followed by a}} 1992 vote by the Crimean parliament to hold a referendum on independence from Ukraine, which spawned a two-year crisis over the status of Crimea. At the same time, the Supreme Soviet of Russia voted to void the cession of Crimea to Ukraine. In June of the same year, the Ukrainian government in Kiev voted to give Crimea a large amount autonomy as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea within Ukraine. Despite this, fighting between the Crimean government, Russian government, and Ukrainian government continued. In 1994, Russian nationalist Yuri Meshkov won the 1994 Crimean presidential election, and implemented the earlier approved referendum on the status of Crimea. 1.3 million <b>people</b> <b>voted</b> in this referendum, 78.4% of whom supported greater autonomy from Ukraine, whilst 82.8% supported allowing dual Russian-Ukrainian citizenship. Later in that same year, the status of Crimea as part of Ukraine was recognised by Russia, which pledged to uphold the territorial integrity of Ukraine in the Budapest Memorandum. This treaty was also signed by the United States, United Kingdom, and France. Ukraine revoked the Constitution of Crimea and abolished the office of President of Crimea in 1995. Crimea was granted a new constitution in 1998, which granted lesser autonomy than the previous one. Crimean officials would later seek to restore the powers of the previous constitution. Throughout the 1990s, many Crimean Tatar deportees and their descendants returned to Crimea.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{models of}} why <b>people</b> <b>vote</b> conceptualize voting as a static, self-interested decision. This {{conceptualization}} cannot explain why <b>people</b> <b>vote</b> given the miniscule probability that their vote will affect most election outcomes. In this chapter we advance a new behavioral model of why <b>people</b> <b>vote.</b> We begin by describing recent field experimental research that inductively explores {{the characteristics of}} effective get-out-the-vote communication channels. This research finds that more personal means of communicating (i. e., face-to-face canvassing) are more motivating than less personal ones (i. e., telephone calls). We then develop a conceptual model of voting as a “dynamic social expression. ” Doing so links {{the question of why}} <b>people</b> <b>vote</b> to an array of behavioral research that has not been systematically linked to it before. We discuss implications for voter mobilization strategy, and also set out an agenda for future research. 2 In political science and economics, voting is traditionally conceived as a quasi rational decision made by self-interested individuals.
