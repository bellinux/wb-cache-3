5|$|BZP is a <b>piperazine</b> {{derivative}} {{which comes}} as either the hydrochloride salt or a free base. The hydrochloride salt {{is a white}} solid while the base form is a slightly yellowish-green liquid. BZP base is corrosive and causes burns.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{recommendation}} of the EACD, the New Zealand government has passed legislation which placed BZP, along with the other <b>piperazine</b> derivatives TFMPP, mCPP, pFPP, MeOPP and MBZP, into Class C of the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act 1975. A ban was intended to come into effect in New Zealand on 18 December 2007, but the law change did not go through until the following year, and the sale of BZP and the other listed piperazines became illegal in New Zealand as of 1 April 2008. An amnesty for possession and usage of these drugs was in effect until October 2008, at which point they became completely illegal.|$|E
5|$|Piperazine-based stimulants {{began to}} appear in Europe in 2000 but {{remained}} virtually unavailable {{in the rest of the}} world until recently. In early 2006, pills containing the active ingredients BZP and TFMPP {{began to appear}} in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where they first gained popularity with late night party-goers as a purported safer alternative to many of the illicit street drugs commonly available there. In 2007 <b>piperazine</b> based party-pill formulations started to become widely available nationwide which has caused concern with local authorities such as Health Canada and subsequently BZP has gained much media attention in 2008. In the United States, it is still used as an adulterant in ecstasy mimic tablets.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} provide α-substituted <b>piperazines</b> for early-stage {{medicinal}} chemistry studies, a simple, general synthetic approach is required. Here, we report the development of two general and simple procedures for the racemic lithiation/trapping of N-Boc <b>piperazines.</b> Optimum lithiation times have been determined using in situ IR spectroscopy and the previous complicated and diverse literature procedures have been simplified. Subsequent trapping with electrophiles delivered {{a wide range of}} α-functionalised N-Boc <b>piperazines.</b> The scope and limitations of the distal N-group has been investigated. The selective α- and β- arylation of N-Boc <b>piperazines</b> via lithiation/Negishi coupling is reported...|$|R
50|$|The anxiolytics {{are also}} {{classified}} as azapirones {{due to the}} azaspirodecanedione moiety in their structures. 1-PP is a common metabolite of {{most or all of}} the listed agents. Alnespirone, binospirone, and enilospirone, despite being azapirones, are not <b>piperazines</b> and therefore do not metabolize to 1-PP, and while perospirone and tiospirone are <b>piperazines,</b> they are instead benzothiazole-substituted <b>piperazines</b> and do not metabolize to 1-PP either.|$|R
50|$|<b>Piperazines</b> were {{originally}} named {{because of their}} chemical similarity with piperidine, part {{of the structure of}} piperine in the black pepper plant (Piper nigrum). It is important to note, however, that <b>piperazines</b> are not derived from plants in the Piper genus.|$|R
5|$|The {{effects of}} BZP are largely similar to {{amphetamine}}s, with one study finding that former amphetamine addicts {{were unable to}} distinguish between dextroamphetamine and BZP administered intravenously. Users report alertness, euphoria and a general feeling of well being. The perception of certain sensations such as taste, colour or music may be subjectively enhanced. The average duration is longer than that of dextroamphetamine, typically lasting 4–6 hours with reports as long as 8 hours depending on the dose. A recent study has shown that mixtures of BZP with other <b>piperazine</b> drugs such as TFMPP share certain pharmacodynamic traits with MDMA.|$|E
25|$|Pentaethylenehexamine, {{abbreviated}} PEHA, (H2N-CH2CH2-NH-CH2CH2-NH-CH2CH2-NH-CH2CH2-NH-CH2CH2-NH2), up to polyethylene amine. Similarly <b>piperazine</b> is an analogue of dioxane.|$|E
25|$|In {{a virtual}} screen for novel agonists, a structure-activity {{relationship}} was determined {{from the most}} potent compounds ('hits') identified. These hits contained a pyrazolopyrimidine core (shown in figure 5), which is important for potency toward the 5-HT2C receptors. Compounds with maximum potency featured two substituents linked to the core structure. The first substituent is a <b>piperazine</b> ring, containing a small hydrophobic group; the second substituent is a phenyl part containing a halogen- and/or oxygen-containing side chain (electronegative groups), see derivatives 1 and 2 in figure 5. Addition of aromatic groups to the <b>piperazine</b> ring reduces potency (derivative 4 in figure 5) {{and the absence of}} the <b>piperazine</b> ring or substitution with other aliphatic- or cyclic groups reduces potency as well (derivatives 5 and 6 in figure 5).|$|E
50|$|<b>Piperazines</b> {{are also}} used in the {{manufacture}} of plastics, resins, pesticides, brake fluid and other industrial materials. <b>Piperazines,</b> especially BZP and TFMPP were extremely common adulterants in the club and rave scene, often being passed off as MDMA, although they do not share many similarities in their effects.|$|R

25|$|The {{medications}} <b>Piperazine</b> and Thiabendazole are {{no longer}} commonly used as equine wormers; they {{have been replaced by}} the above drugs.|$|E
25|$|Various cyclic amine {{groups can}} act as the basic moiety and potency stays {{relatively}} unchanged for example aryl <b>piperazine,</b> piperidine and morpholine. An acyclic tertiary amine is tolerated as the basic moiety but larger steric groups are less tolerated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Piperazine</b> is a flaccid paralyzing {{agent that}} blocks the {{response}} of Ascaris muscle to acetylcholine, which immobilizes the worm. It prevents migration when treatment is accomplished with weak drugs such as thiabendazole. If used by itself, it causes the worm to be passed out in the feces and may be used when worms have caused blockage of the intestine or the biliary duct.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} some novel {{aspects of}} the s-BuLi mediated lithiation/trapping of N-Boc heterocycles, including a systematic investigation into the lithiation/trapping of N-Boc <b>piperazines.</b> Chapter 2 details an in situ ReactIR™ investigation into the time required for both the lithiation and trapping events of some commonly used N-Boc heterocycles. The remarkable difference in the time taken for trapping with some electrophiles is of particular note. The information garnered in this investigation was used to direct the racemic and asymmetric lithiation of N-Boc <b>piperazines,</b> as described in Chapters 3 and 4. A series of complications were encountered and overcome. The methodology culminated in the synthesis of enantiopure mono- and disubstituted N-Boc <b>piperazines</b> In Chapter 5, {{an investigation into the}} synthesis of the (–) -sparteine surrogate is reported. Two strategies are described: synthesis and classic resolution of racemic sparteine surrogate and the synthesis of enantiopure sparteien surrogate from commercially available precursors...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the ethyleneamine homologs, side products exist. Aziridine occurs by the cyclization of chloroethylamine; <b>piperazines</b> are formed by cyclization of a two-ethylene unit compound to give the six-membered ring.|$|R
25|$|Vardenafil's {{indications}} and contraindications are {{the same}} as with other PDE5 inhibitors; it is closely related in function to sildenafil citrate (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis). The difference between the vardenafil molecule and sildenafil citrate is a nitrogen atom's position and the change of sildenafil's <b>piperazine</b> ring methyl group to an ethyl group. Tadalafil is structurally different from both sildenafil and vardenafil. Vardenafil's relatively short effective time is comparable to but somewhat longer than sildenafil's.|$|E
25|$|Medications {{that are}} used to kill roundworms are called ascaricides. Those {{recommended}} by the World Health Organization for ascariasis are: albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole and pyrantel pamoate. Other effective agents include tribendimidine and nitazoxanide. Pyrantel pamoate may induce intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load. Albendazole is contraindicated during pregnancy and children under two years of age. Thiabendazole may cause migration of the worm into the esophagus, so it is usually combined with <b>piperazine.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the drug}} {{discovery}} process of a 5-HT2C agonist, a pharmacophore module {{has been used}} to discover novel 5-HT2C receptor ligands. The pharmacophore has four features; one aromatic ring, two hydrophobic features and one positive ionizable feature. Figure 4 shows an example of a compound that fits the agonist pharmacophore perfectly. The nitrogen atom of <b>piperazine</b> fits the positive ionizable feature, the benzofuran part fits the aromatic ring and one hydrophobic, and the trifluoromethane part fits another hydrophobic feature of the pharmacophore.|$|E

25|$|Imatinib {{is rapidly}} absorbed when given by mouth, and is highly bioavailable: 98% of an oral dose reaches the bloodstream. Metabolism of imatinib {{occurs in the}} liver and is {{mediated}} by several isozymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. The main metabolite, N-demethylated <b>piperazine</b> derivative, is also active. The major route of elimination is in the bile and feces; {{only a small portion}} of the drug is excreted in the urine. Most of imatinib is eliminated as metabolites; only 25% is eliminated unchanged. The half-lives of imatinib and its main metabolite are 18 h and 40 h, respectively. It blocks the activity of Abelson cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (ABL), c-Kit and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). As an inhibitor of PDGFR, imatinib mesylate appears to have utility in the treatment of a variety of dermatological diseases. Imatinib has been reported to be an effective treatment for FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha+ mast cell disease, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.|$|E
500|$|<b>Piperazine</b> and salts of <b>piperazine</b> are {{classified}} as Prescription Only Medicines in the UK. Any products containing salts of <b>piperazine</b> would be licensable under the Medicines Act and consequently anyone manufacturing and supplying it legally must hold the relevant licenses to do so. BZP is not a salt of <b>piperazine,</b> but mislabelling of BZP products as containing [...] "piperazine blend" [...] resulted in some prosecutions of suppliers in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, although none were successful. In May 2009, the Home Office announced plans to ban BZP, and launched a consultation on the proposal. In October 2009, {{it was announced that}} from 23 December 2009, BZP and related piperazines would be Class C drugs under the Misuse Of Drugs Act.|$|E
500|$|It {{is often}} claimed that BZP was {{originally}} synthesized {{as a potential}} antihelminthic (anti-parasitic) agent for use in farm animals. However, there are some references to BZP in medical literature that predate interest in piperazines as antihelminthics. Even so, {{the majority of the}} early work with the piperazines were investigations into their potential use as antihelminthics with the earliest clinical trials in the literature relating to <b>piperazine</b> being articles in the British Medical Journal in the 1950s. It was discovered that BZP had side effects and was largely abandoned as a worm treatment. It next appears in the literature in the 1970s when it was investigated as a potential antidepressant medication, but rejected when research reported that BZP had amphetamine-like effects and was liable to abuse. The study suggested that BZP “should be placed under statutory control similar to those regulating the use of amphetamine.” ...|$|E

500|$|The {{drug was}} {{classified}} as a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States in 2002, following {{a report by the}} DEA which incorrectly stated that BZP was 10 to 20 times more potent than amphetamine, when in fact BZP is ten times less potent than dexamphetamine. [...] BZP is banned in all Australian states. Victoria, the last state in which it was legal, changed its classification on 1 September 2006. This is the date BZP and <b>piperazine</b> analogs become illegal in the federal schedules which are now enacted by all Australian states and territories. BZP is also a banned substance in Japan, along with TFMPP. Both Australia and Japan admit that their scheduling decisions were made primarily in response to the Schedule 1 classification given to BZP in the USA, although some instances of BZP use had been reported by law enforcement authorities in both countries. BZP is also banned in Greece, Poland, Italy, Ireland, Malta, Estonia, Denmark and Sweden.|$|E

2500|$|Zopiclone is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} method of suicide. It has a similar fatality index to that of [...] benzodiazepine drugs, apart from temazepam, which is particularly toxic in overdose. Deaths have occurred from zopiclone overdose, alone or in combination with other drugs. Overdose of zopiclone may present with excessive sedation and depressed respiratory function that may progress to coma and possibly death. Zopiclone combined with alcohol, opiates, or other central nervous system depressants may be even more likely to lead to fatal overdoses. Zopiclone overdosage can be treated with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil, which displaces zopiclone from its binding site on the benzodiazepine receptor, thereby rapidly reversing its effects. Serious effects on the heart may also occur from a zopiclone overdose when combined with <b>piperazine.</b>|$|E
