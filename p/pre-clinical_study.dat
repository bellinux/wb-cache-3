50|$|The 5CSRTT was {{initially}} designed by Trevor Robbins and {{colleagues in the}} early 1980s as an analogue of the human continuous performance task. Because the 5CSRTT has separate measures of attention, impulsivity, and reaction times, it has proven useful in the <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>study</b> of the treatment of diagnoses such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and is also a precursor to modern rodent models of gambling and decision making.|$|E
5000|$|In 1912 a new {{curriculum}} for the M.D. degree was introduced that required {{two years of}} <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>study</b> at Stanford's main campus, followed by 2 years of guided treatment of patients in hospital wards and clinics in San Francisco; a research-based thesis also becomes a requirement. This change reflected recommendations made in the 1910 Flexner Report. In 1923 the curriculum was revised again, reducing required instruction to fewer than 4,000 hours - the amount required for students {{to be eligible for}} state licensing of physicians. The difference was to be made up through required work in departments of the student's choice, fostering further specialization. In 1941, due to a demand for physicians in the Armed Forces during World War II, Stanford University Medical School developed the [...] "9-9-9" [...] Medical Plan, accelerating the time required to complete the M.D. program. The program was discontinued in 1945.|$|E
30|$|There {{is a major}} {{discrepancy}} between the previous <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>studies</b> of 124 I-IAZGP, which demonstrated its ability to detect hypoxia in tumor cells both in vitro and in small animal models [27, 28, 33, 34], and these clinical findings.

Our <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>studies</b> used activities of approximately 16.7 MBq in 25 -g mice [27] or approximately 18.5 MBq in 200 -g rats [28], corresponding to approximately 100 to 700 MBq/kg.

40|$|Combinations {{of drugs}} are {{increasingly}} being used {{for a wide variety}} of diseases and conditions. A <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>study</b> may allow the investigation of the response at a large number of dose combinations. In determining the response to a drug combination, interest may lie in seeking evidence of synergism, in which the joint action is greater than the actions of the individual drugs, or of antagonism, in which it is less. Two well-known response surface models representing no interaction are Loewe additivity and Bliss independence, and Loewe or Bliss synergism or antagonism is defined relative to these. We illustrate an approach to fitting these models for the case in which the marginal single drug dose-response relationships are represented by four-parameter logistic curves with common upper and lower limits, and where the response variable is normally distributed with a common variance about the dose-response curve. When the dose-response curves are not parallel, the relative potency of the two drugs varies according to the magnitude of the desired effect and the models for Loewe additivity and synergism/antagonism cannot be explicitly expressed. We present an iterative approach to fitting these models without the assumption of parallel dose-response curves. A goodness-of-fit test based on residuals is also described.
