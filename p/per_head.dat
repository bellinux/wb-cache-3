5|$|Over the {{eighteen}} years that Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union, average income <b>per</b> <b>head</b> increased by half; three-quarters of this growth {{came in the}} 1960s and early 1970s. During {{the second half of}} Brezhnev's reign, average income <b>per</b> <b>head</b> grew by one-quarter. In {{the first half of the}} Brezhnev period, income <b>per</b> <b>head</b> increased by 3.5% per annum; slightly less growth than what it had been the previous years. This can be explained by Brezhnev's reversal of most of Khrushchev's policies. Consumption <b>per</b> <b>head</b> rose by an estimated 70% under Brezhnev, but with three-quarters of this growth happening before 1973 and only one-quarter in the second half of his rule. Most of the increase in consumer production in the early Brezhnev era can be attributed to the Kosygin reform.|$|E
5|$|From 1964 to 1973, the GDP <b>per</b> <b>head</b> in US dollars increased. Over the {{eighteen}} years Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union, average income <b>per</b> <b>head</b> increased by half in equivalent US dollars. In {{the first half}} of the Brezhnev period, income <b>per</b> <b>head</b> increased by 3.5 percent per annum, though this represented slightly less growth than in the last years of Khrushchev. This can be explained by the reversion of most of Khrushchev's policies when Brezhnev came to power. Over time, however, citizens did find themselves better off than under Khrushchev. Consumption <b>per</b> <b>head</b> rose by an estimated 70% under Brezhnev, though three-quarters of this growth happened before 1973 and only one-quarter in the second half of his time in office. Most of the increase in consumer production in the early Brezhnev era can be attributed to the Kosygin reform, according to an analysis on the performance of the reform carried out by the Moscow State University.|$|E
5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Industrial Revolution, {{development}} of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales, mainly in and around Cardiff (the capital), Swansea and Newport, and in the nearby valleys. Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, Wales' economy depends on the public sector, light and service industries and tourism. Wales' 2010 gross value added (GVA) was £45.5 billion (£15,145 <b>per</b> <b>head,</b> 74.0% of the average for the UK, and the lowest GVA <b>per</b> <b>head</b> in Britain).|$|E

5|$|Over {{the last}} 250 years, Wales has been {{transformed}} first from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and now a post-industrial economy. Since the Second World War, the service sector has come {{to account for the}} majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies. Total headline Gross Value Added (GVA) in Wales in 2010 was £45.5 billion, or £15,145 <b>per</b> <b>head</b> of population; 74.0 per cent of the average for the UK total, the lowest GVA <b>per</b> <b>head</b> in the UK. In the three months to July 2010, the employment rate for working-age adults in Wales was 67 per cent, compared to 70.7 per cent across the UK as a whole.|$|E

There {{may be one}} or two camshafts in the cylinder head; a single camshaft design is called single overhead camshaft (SOHC). A design with two camshafts <b>per</b> cylinder <b>head</b> is called double overhead camshaft (DOHC). Note that the camshafts are counted <b>per</b> cylinder <b>head,</b> so a V engine with one camshaft in each of its two-cylinder heads is still an SOHC design, and a V engine with two camshafts <b>per</b> cylinder <b>head</b> is DOHC, or informally a [...] "quad cam" [...] engine.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Upon implementation of the Federal Clean Air Act and with the anticipated increase in resources of state air pollution regulatory agencies, regulation of air quality will expand to agricultural production and processing industries. This expansion of state air pollution regulatory agencies will require accurate EPA AP- 42 emission factors. A protocol was developed so that accurate emission factors can be determined using both source sampling data and dispersion modeling. In this study, an emission factor was developed, using measured and predicted concentrations, for cattle feedyards. An emission factor of 10 pounds <b>per</b> 1000 <b>head</b> <b>per</b> day was recommended for the cattle feeding industry. This emission factor agreed with the average and seasonally weighted emission factor of 9. 2 and 10. 2 pounds <b>per</b> 1000 <b>head</b> <b>per</b> day, respectively. This was much lower than the current EPA AP- 42 emission factor of 280 pounds <b>per</b> 1000 <b>head</b> <b>per</b> day. An emission factor of 10 pounds <b>per</b> 1000 <b>head</b> <b>per</b> day was used when developing isoplanes to illustrate the particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than under ten microns (PMIO) and total suspended particulate (TSP) concentrations. The isoplanes were developed for 10, 000, 20, 000, and 40, 000 head feedyards in the Amarillo, Lubbock, San Angelo, and Brownsville area. These isoplanes can provide guidance to the cattle feeding industry when siting feedyards with respect to the predicted downwind particulate concentrations and the property line...|$|R

The majority of students are concentrated on Oxford Road in Manchester, Europe's largest urban higher education precinct.|$|E
5|$|Having been proclaimed emperor {{solely on}} the {{initiative}} of the Senate, Nerva had to introduce a number of measures to gain support among the Roman populace. As was custom by this time, a change of emperor was expected to bring with it a generous payment of gifts and money {{to the people and}} the army. Accordingly, a congiarium of 75 denarii <b>per</b> <b>head</b> was bestowed upon the citizens, while the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard received a donativum which may have amounted to as much as 5000 denarii per person. This was followed by a string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxation from the most needy Romans.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, West Wales was {{identified}} as the worst-performing region in the United Kingdom along with the South Wales Valleys. The gross value added economic indicator showed a figure of £14,763 <b>per</b> <b>head</b> in these regions, as compared with a GVA of £22,986 for Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. The Welsh Assembly Government is aware of this, and helped by government initiatives and local actions, opportunities for farmers to diversify have emerged. These include farm tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and added-value food products.|$|E

5|$|Oil and gas {{were first}} landed in 1978 at Sullom Voe, which has {{subsequently}} {{become one of}} the largest terminals in Europe. Taxes from the oil have increased public sector spending on social welfare, art, sport, environmental measures and financial development. Three quarters of the islands' workforce is employed in the service sector, and the Shetland Islands Council alone accounted for 27.9% of output in 2003. Shetland's access to oil revenues has funded the Shetland Charitable Trust, which in turn funds a wide variety of local programmes. The balance of the fund in 2011 was £217 million, i.e., about £9,500 <b>per</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
5|$|All the same, between 1853 and the 1930s, fiscal {{instability}} was a transitory phenomenon. The depressions of 1873–77 and 1890–91 {{played a}} crucial role in fostering the rise of industry: timidly in the 1870s and more decisively in the 1890s, industry grew with each crisis in response to the need of a damaged economy to improve its trade balance through import-substitution. By 1914, about 15% the Argentine labour force was involved in manufacturing, compared to 20% involved in commercial activities. In 1913, the country's income <b>per</b> <b>head</b> was on a par with that of France and Germany, and far ahead of Italy's or Spain's. At the end of 1913, Argentina had a gold stock of £59 million, or 3.7% of the world's monetary gold, while representing 1.2% of the world's economic output.|$|E
5|$|Angus Maddison {{estimates}} that the country's gross domestic product was equivalent to $450 <b>per</b> <b>head</b> in 1990 United States dollars—a sum that was above subsistence level, and which did not significantly change {{until the beginning of}} the Song dynasty in the late 10th century. Sinologist Joseph Needham has disputed this and claimed that China's GDP per capita exceeded Europe by substantial margins from the 5th century BCE onwards, holding that Han China was much wealthier than the contemporary Roman Empire. The widespread circulation of coin cash enriched many merchants, who invested their money in land and became wealthy landowners. The government's efforts to circulate cash had empowered the very social class which it actively tried to suppress through heavy taxes, fines, confiscations, and price regulation schemes.|$|E

5|$|Because of poor-quality soil, much of Wales is {{unsuitable}} for crop-growing and livestock farming {{has traditionally been}} the focus of agriculture. The Welsh landscape (protected by three national parks) and 45 Blue Flag beaches, as well as the unique culture of Wales, attract large numbers of tourists, who play an especially vital role in the economy of rural areas. Wales has struggled to develop or attract high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) – Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output <b>per</b> <b>head</b> relative to other regions of the UK – in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status.|$|E
5|$|For example, in most {{underdeveloped}} economies, {{the technology}} {{used to carry}} out agricultural activities is backward. There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while {{a large proportion of}} the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%. This points to the need to increase output per unit input and output <b>per</b> <b>head.</b> This can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities, high-yielding variety seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The positive outcome of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the underdeveloped country.|$|E
5|$|During 1928–1973, the Soviet Union {{was growing}} {{economically}} {{at a pace}} that would eventually catch up with the United States and Western Europe. This was true despite the advantage the United States had — the USSR was hampered by the effects of World War II, which had left most of Western USSR in ruins. In 1973, the process of catching up {{with the rest of the}} West came to an abrupt end, and 1973 was seen by some scholars as the start of the Era of Stagnation. The beginning of the stagnation coincided with a financial crisis in Western Europe and the U.S. By the early 1970s, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest industrial capacity, and produced more steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and tractors than any other country. Before 1973, the Soviet economy was expanding at faster rate than that of the American economy (albeit by a very small margin). The USSR also kept a steady pace with the economies of Western Europe. Between 1964 and 1973, the Soviet economy stood at roughly half the output <b>per</b> <b>head</b> of Western Europe and a little more than one third that of the U.S.|$|E
