Microphonic potentials from fishes with the swim bladder intact were proportional to sound pressure. After removal of the swim bladder, sound pressure sensitivity declined by 20 - 35 dB and the response was generated in proportion to particle displacement. The ear's sensitivity to direct vibration of the head increases at between — 3 and — 6 dB/octave between 70 and 1500 Hz and is not affected by the removal of the swim bladder. It is concluded that the peripheral auditory system of the goldfish may function as a <b>pressure</b> <b>detector</b> or as a displacement detector, depending upon the impedance of the applied signal...|$|E

This paper presents a transcutaneous power supplied implantable electrical stimulation system. This technology solves the problem of supplying extended power to an implanted electrical stimulator.

Upon exposure to acetic acid at 1 % of its vapor <b>pressure,</b> <b>detectors</b> consisting of linear poly(ethylenimine) (l-PEI) −carbon black composites showed an ∼ 10 ^ 3 increase in signal/noise {{relative to the}} performance of typical insulating organic polymer−carbon black composite vapor detectors. Compositional diversity in an array of such vapor detectors was obtained by varying the degree of plasticization of the l-PEI films. The resulting vapor detector array produced sensitive detection of, and robust discrimination between, various volatile organic acids and relatively little response from nonacidic organic vapors or from water vapor. Measurements of the mass uptake, thickness change, and electrical conductivity of such composites indicate that swelling of the polymer film, and thus its normalized resistance response, is beyond that expected by mass uptake alone upon exposure to acetic acid vapor. This additional thickness increase is attributed to charge-induced polymer swelling occurring from polymer−analyte interactions. Electrical percolation also plays a significant role in producing the large increase in normalized resistance response of these composites upon exposure to acetic acid vapor...|$|R

40|$|KEY WORDS ears; scolopale; sound reception; chordotonal organ; tympanum; {{directional}} hearing ABSTRACT This paper {{provides an}} overview of insect peripheral auditory systems focusing on tympanate ears (<b>pressure</b> <b>detectors)</b> and emphasizing research during the last 15 years. The theme throughout is the evolution of hearing in insects. Ears have appeared independently no fewer than 19 times in the class Insecta and are located on various thoracic and abdominal body segments, on legs, on wings, and on mouth parts. All have fundamentally similar structures—a tympanum backed by a tracheal sac and a tympanal chordotonal organ—though they vary widely in size, ancillary structures, and number of chordotonal sensilla. Novel ears have recently been discovered in praying mantids, two families of beetles, and two families of flies. The tachinid flies are especially notable because they use a previously unknown mechanism for sound localization. Developmental and comparative studies have identified the evolutionary precursors of the tympanal chordotonal organs in several insects; they are uniformly chordotonal proprioceptors. Tympanate species fall into clusters determined by which of the embryologi-cally defined chordotonal organ groups in each body segment served as precursor for the tympanal organ. This suggests that the many appearances of hearing could arise from changes in a small number of developmental modules. The nature of those developmental changes that lead to...|$|R

A further increase in the air content decreases the volume loss causing a cushioning effect of bubble collapses. The cavitation erosion increases with increased vapor pressure and reaches a peak, followed by a decrease. The initial increase is due to the increased number of bubbles. Thus, cavitation erosion mainly affected by both air content a and vapor pressure Pν of liquid properties. The volume loss rate can be described as Pν^ ・e^. A critical rate air content is found to be 1. 6, below which the air content does no longer affect the volume loss rate.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{investigate}} {{the cause of}} axial eye motion artifacts that occur in optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the retina. Understanding the cause of these motions can lead to improved OCT image quality and therefore better diagnoses. METHODS. Twenty-seven measurements were performed on 5 subjects. Spectral domain OCT images at the macula were collected over periods up to 30 seconds. The axial shift of every average A-scan was calculated {{with respect to the}} previous average A-scan by calculating the cross-correlation. The frequency spectrum of the calculated shifts versus time was determined. The heart rate was determined from blood pressure measurements at the finger using an optical blood <b>pressure</b> <b>detector.</b> The fundamental frequency and higher order harmonics of the axial OCT shift were compared with the frequency spectrum of blood pressure data. In addition, simultaneous registration of the movement of the cornea and the retina was performed with a dual reference arm OCT setup, and movements of the head were also analyzed. RESULTS. A correlation of 0. 90 was found between the fundamental frequency in the axial OCT shift and the heart rate. Cornea and retina move simultaneously in the axial direction. The entire head moves with the same amplitude as the retina. CONCLUSIONS. Axial motion artifacts during OCT volume scanning of the retina are caused by movements of the whole head induced by the heartbeat.

40|$|International audienceAt the fluid/elastic-solid {{interface}} {{the well-known}} leaky Rayleigh and Stoneley waves can propagate. The impedance {{associated with such}} an interface wave interrelates the corresponding waveforms that {{can be observed in}} different components, i. e., the particle motion and fluid pressure. We show that the interface-wave impedance of the leaky-Rayleigh wave, excited at a water/aluminum interface, can be successfully extracted using an experiment in which we simultaneously measure both components at ultrasonic frequencies. In particular, the normal interface displacement is measured using a laser Doppler vibrometer and the pressure with a needle hydrophone. The impedance of the leaky Rayleigh wave can be clearly distinguished in the wavenumber-frequency domain. Any measurement that employs a laser Doppler vibrometer is perturbed by refractive-index changes along its beam once it interferes with acoustic waves. Using a model that accounts for these perturbations, we predict a significant impedance decrease with respect to the plane-wave impedance of the leaky Rayleigh wave. Although this deviation is different for the experimentally extracted impedance, there is very good agreement between the observed and predicted waveforms in both the displacement and fluid pressure. This shows that laser ultrasonic devices and small <b>pressure</b> <b>detectors</b> can be successfully combined in laboratory-scale experiments...|$|R

Among the proposed strategies to increase the throughput, the use of short narrow-bore columns packed with sub- 3 m core–shell and porous sub- 2 m particles have emerged as the gold standards. Nevertheless, to take the full benefits of these modern supports, a suitable chromatographic system has to be employed. This review summarizes the instrumental needs and challenges in terms of extra-column variance, dwell volume, maximum system <b>pressure,</b> <b>detector</b> data acquisition rate, and injection cycle time. In addition, because of their reasonable pressure drop, the use of columns packed with sub- 3 m core–shell particles on a conventional LC instrument is discussed in detail. A methodology is proposed to check the compatibility between stationary phase and instrument, and some solutions are proposed to improve the performance of standard instruments. Finally, because the column technology is evolving faster than instrumentation, it is nowadays possible to purchase short, narrow-bore columns packed with 1. 3 m core–shell particles. Micro columns (1 mm I. D.) packed with 1. 7 – 1. 9 m porous particles are also available from several providers, which limit frictional heating effects and reduce solvent and sample consumption.

Cardiac excitation and respiration were measured and recorded throughout the scan using a dedicated system (BioVet; Spin Systems Pty Ltd., USA).

Animals were returned to their home cage for recovery. The cardiac cycle from the FDG list-mode acquisitions was divided into eight equal intervals using the Siemens-Inveon acquisition workplace and reconstructed using MAP 3 D with 32 iterations and OSEM 3 D with 4 iterations. Since we used eight bins for gated reconstruction, the time resolution for the PET {{is equal to the}} mean heartbeat duration/ 8 for a mean heart rate of 500 [*]bpm resulted in a temporal resolution of 15 [*]ms.

40|$|An {{observation}} of the anisotropy of dark matter interactions in a direction-sensitive detector would provide decisive evidence for the discovery of galactic dark matter. Directional information would also provide a crucial input to understanding its distribution in the local Universe. Most of the existing directional dark matter detectors utilize particle tracking methods in a low-pressure gas time projection chamber. These low <b>pressure</b> <b>detectors</b> require excessively large volumes {{in order to be}} competitive in the search for physics beyond the current limit. In order to avoid these volume limitations, we consider a novel proposal, which exploits a columnar recombination effect in a high-pressure gas time projection chamber. The ratio of scintillation to ionization signals observed in the detector carries the angular information of the particle interactions. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of a future directional detector focused on the proposed high-pressure Xenon gas time projection chamber. We study the prospect of detecting an anisotropy in the dark matter velocity distribution. We find that tens of events are needed to exclude an isotropic distribution of dark matter interactions at 95 % confidence level in the most optimistic case with head-to-tail information. However, one needs at least 10 - 20 times more events without head-to-tail information for light dark matter below 50 GeV. For an intermediate mass range, we find it challenging to observe an anisotropy of the dark matter distribution. Our results also show that the directional information significantly improves precision measurements of dark matter mass and the elastic scattering cross section for a heavy dark matter.

A second incubation, conducted using the same experimental design, was stopped at t 1 / 2.

In the second incubation, BHT increased acetate at the expense of butyrate proportion (P < 0. 01). Red chicory extract did not influence GP, feed degradability, or volatile fatty acids production in either incubation. Both BHT and red chicory induced a dosage-dependent increase in microbial nitrogen production at t 1 / 2 (P < 0. 05), on average from 7. 0 to 13. 9 mg/g DM.

The impedance was deduced from the scattering parameter S 11 measured by a network analyzer using an RF input power of 0 dB (that corresponds to an excitation of about 1 mA across the sample) after proper calibration and mathematical subtraction of the test fixture contributions. Details of the measuring procedure can be found elsewhere [9]. The test fixture containing the sample is placed inside a pair of Helmholtz coils to provide the variable magnetic field. To study {{the performance of the}} samples deposited onto the COC substrates as <b>pressure</b> <b>detectors,</b> different weights were placed over a rectangular glass (14 × 18 mm) situated onto the sample, reaching a maximum pressure of 4 Pa. In this way, the sample's complex impedance Z was measured at different pressure values {{as a function of the}} external magnetic field in a frequency range of 300 kHz to 300 MHz. In this range, the ferromagnetic resonance effects are still unimportant, and quasi-static processes dominate the MI behavior [10]. The GMI ratio was defined with respect to the magnetically saturated sample in the maximum applied field of Hsat = 12 kA/m. Also, GMI sensitivities [...]...|$|R

The {{focal plane}} of S 3 (Super Separator Spectrometer), a new {{experimental}} area of SPIRAL 2 at GANIL, {{will be used}} for identification of nuclei, and requires the reconstruction of their trajectories and velocities by the Time Of Flight (TOF) method. Classical tracking detectors used in-beam would generate a lot of angular and energy straggling due to their thickness. One solution is the use of a SED (Secondary Electron Detection), which consists of a thin emissive foil in beam coupled to a low <b>pressure</b> gaseous <b>detector</b> out of the beam, for the detection of secondary electrons ejected from the foil. Moreover, this type of detector can be used for classical beam tracking at low energies, or for example at NFS (GANIL) for the FALSTAFF experiment for the reconstruction of fission fragments trajectories. Several low <b>pressure</b> gaseous <b>detectors</b> such as wire chambers and Micromegas have been constructed and tested since 2008. High counting rate capabilities and good time resolution obtained in previous tests motivated {{the construction of a new}} real-size 2 D prototype wire chamber and a 2 D bulk Micromegas at low pressure. For the first time, spatial resolution of the Micromegas at low pressure (below 20 mbar) in the SED configuration was measured. Different tests have been performed in order to characterize time and spatial properties of both prototypes, giving spatial resolution in the horizontal (X) direction of 0. 90 (0. 02) mm FWHM for the real size prototype and 0. 72 (0. 08) mm FWHM for Micromegas, and a time resolution of ~ 110 (25) ps for the real size prototype.
