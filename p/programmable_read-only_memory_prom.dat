50|$|Intel did not {{market the}} Intellec as a {{general-purpose}} microcomputer, {{but rather as}} a development system. As the first microprocessors were intended to run embedded systems such as in calculators, computer terminals and digital watches, the Intellec was used for programming programmable memory chips used by embedded systems, e.g. the 2048-bit (256-byte) Intel 1602A <b>programmable</b> <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (<b>PROM)</b> or erasable 1702A EPROM chips which were plugged into a ZIF socket on the Intellec-8's front panel.

50|$|A <b>{{programmable}}</b> <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (<b>PROM)</b> or field programmable {{read-only memory}} (FPROM) or one-time programmable non-volatile memory (OTP NVM) {{is a form of}} digital memory where the setting of each bit is locked by a fuse or antifuse. It is one type of ROM (read-only memory). The data in them is permanent and cannot be changed. PROMs are used in digital electronic devices to store permanent data, usually low level programs such as firmware (microcode). The key difference from a standard ROM is that the data is written into a ROM during manufacture, while with a PROM the data is programmed into them after manufacture. Thus, ROMs tend to be used only for large production runs with well-verified data, while PROMs are used to allow companies to test on a subset of the devices in an order before burning data into all of them.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis paper demonstrates {{a nuclear reactor}} safety monitor incorporating hard-wired, redundant, digital program modules that control independent, redundant, digital monitor modules. One monitor module is used for each parameter significant to reactor safety. The characteristics of a proposed LIQUID METAL FAST BREEDER REACTOR are used as the reference performance criteria. The established criterion that a single failure must not prevent reactor shut down is used as the failure mode criterion. Within the program module, a <b>programmable</b> <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (<b>PROM)</b> is used for sequence control of another PROM containing variable length subroutines. The subroutine PROM outputs are used as photo-isolated logic outputs for sequence control of the various monitor modules. The program module action is modeled on a digital computer. A four-input digital monitor module is developed. This module provides a shut down signal if three of the inputs exceed the parameter limit. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|A cycle timer was {{developed}} to assist the driver of an electric vehicle in more accurately following and repeating SAE driving schedules. These schedules require operating an electric vehicle in a selected stop-and-go driving cycle and repeating this cycle pattern until the vehicle ceases {{to meet the requirements}} of the cycle. The heart of the system is a <b>programmable</b> <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (<b>PROM)</b> that has the required test profiles permanently recorded on plug-in cards, one card for each different driving schedule. The PROM generates a direct current analog signal that drives a speedometer displayed on one scale of a dual movement meter. The second scale of the dual movement meter displays the actual speed of the vehicle as recorded by the fifth wheel. The vehicle operator controls vehicle speed to match the desired profile speed. The PROM controls the recycle start time as well as the buzzer activation. The cycle programmer is powered by the test vehicle's 12 -volt accessory battery, through a 5 -volt regulator and a 12 -volt dc-to-dc converter...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} software architecture for the firmware that controls a computer before {{the operating system}} has begun execution. Typically, firmware is stored in read-only memory (ROM) or <b>programmable</b> <b>read-only</b> <b>memory</b> (<b>PROM),</b> so {{that it may be}} executed immediately after the computer is turned on. The main jobs of the firmware are to test the machine hardware and to boot the operating system, usually from a mass storage device or a network. The operating system may also require other services from the firmware. Finally, firmware often provides some support for interactive hardware and software debugging. In addition to the main operating system, other programs, such as diagnostic operating systems, may utilize firmware services. This standard uses OpenBoot PROM Architecture Specification [B 6] 1 as a starting point, and is bus, vendor, operating system (OS), and instruction-set-architecture (ISA) -independent. Supplements (numbered 1275. x) include specifications for this standard’s application to particular ISAs and buses. This document specifies firmware that controls the operation of a computer system before the primary operating system has taken control of the machine. The material specified includes facilities for determining the hardware configuration; testing, identification, and use of plug-in devices prior to primary OS control; reporting the hardware configuration to the operating system; the user interface for controlling these operations; and debugging facilities for hardware and system software...|$|E

The capacitive coupling with offset voltage correction is transcribed into VT transient for simulating erase VT dispersion without numerous full structure device simulations. It is shown that SAP {{gives rise to}} smaller VT dispersion, compared with SA-STI. The VT dispersion resulting from variations in dielectric thickness and oxide edge profiles is shown to fall far short of observed VT distribution, calling for examination of additional process and cell parameters.
