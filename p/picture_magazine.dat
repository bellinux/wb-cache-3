Reflecting on her decision, Wong told Motion <b>Picture</b> <b>Magazine</b> in 1931: [...] "I was so young when I began that I knew I still had youth if I failed, so I determined to give myself 10years to succeed as an actress." ...|$|E
500|$|During 1915, Chaplin {{became a}} {{cultural}} phenomenon. Shops were stocked with Chaplin merchandise, he {{was featured in}} cartoons and comic strips, and several songs were written about him. In July, a journalist for Motion <b>Picture</b> <b>Magazine</b> wrote that [...] "Chaplinitis" [...] had spread across America. As his fame grew worldwide, he became the film industry's first international star. When the Essanay contract ended in December 1915, Chaplin – fully aware of his popularity – requested a $150,000 signing bonus from his next studio. He received several offers, including Universal, Fox, and Vitagraph, the best of which came from the Mutual Film Corporation at $10,000 a week.|$|E
500|$|It Is the Law {{received}} generally positive reviews. George T. Pardy, {{writing for}} Exhibitors Trade Review, {{noted that the}} audience {{was aware of the}} nature of the mystery while the characters were not, a welcome departure from the conventions of most melodramas. Motion <b>Picture</b> <b>Magazine</b> called the film [...] "tense, suspensive, ... and new in its idea." [...] The Film Daily reviewer believed it would appeal to fans of the genre despite [...] "some hokum and implausible twists". Edwards's direction was praised, including his pacing of the story, although the reviewer for Variety felt the film was unnecessarily long. Hohl, in his dual role performance, was considered the strongest of the cast, despite some exaggerated expressions.|$|E

500|$|The men's {{magazine}} Playboy ignited her career, and she {{was featured}} in numerous issues. It has been conjectured that Playboy was a pioneer in starting an American [...] "breast fetish" [...] which has exaggerated the importance of large breasts, in which both Jayne Mansfield and Marilyn Monroe, featured in the early issues of the magazine, played significant roles. Playboy pictorials of Mansfield and Monroe {{were part of the}} emerging trend that gave birth to the large-breasted feminine ideal and men's magazines including Rogue, Nugget and Dude. Numerous other magazines featured her on the cover. These include: Hollywood Studio Magazine: Then And Now (May 1987, Volume 20, No. 5.), Life Magazine (April 23, 1956), Modern Man: The Adult <b>Picture</b> <b>Magazine</b> (March 1966), Photo-Rama Magazine (Volume 6, No. 16) and Playboy (June 1963).|$|E

2500|$|Harrison's Reports {{gave the}} film a very {{favorable}} review, calling it [...] "very good program entertainment", and saying its comedic and action elements were excellent. While {{stating that the}} ending was predictable, {{in spite of that}} they felt it was still thrilling. They particularly highlighted the performance of Devine, and the chemistry between Huston and Travis. Motion Picture Daily also gave the film a favorable review. They felt that the plot left something to be desired, but was more than made up for by the direction, both by Nicholls, and especially by Edward Killy, who handled the football sequences. They were positive about the acting, and also the use of real football players, and they highlighted the performances of Devine and Travis. The Motion Picture Herald called the film [...] "worthwhile entertainment", and did not have the same issue with the plot as Harrison's and Motion Picture Daily, calling it a [...] "well-grounded story". They also enjoyed the mixture of suspense and comedy. Motion <b>Picture</b> <b>Magazine</b> was not as impressed, giving the film only two out of a possible four [...] "A"'s.|$|E
2500|$|The Film Daily {{gave the}} film a good review, calling it an [...] "Intriguing and suspenseful murder mystery and {{triangle}} drama smartly handled all around." [...] They felt the plot was intricate {{and the film}} kept the tension going throughout, complimenting both Murfin for the script and Robertson on his direction. They also praised Lucien Andriot's cinematography. Modern Screen also gave the picture favorable press, stating it was [...] "something new and very interesting in mysteries." [...] Rating the film an overall [...] "B", they singled out the performances of {{all four of the}} leads: Kruger, Asther, Morley, and Wood, calling Kruger's performance [...] "outstanding". Motion Picture Daily enjoyed the film, saying it presented [...] "an arresting and entertaining murder yarn with a surprise twist finish." [...] They also enjoyed Robertson's direction, and the performances of the four leads. Motion <b>Picture</b> <b>Magazine</b> called Kruger's performance one [...] "you should not miss this month." [...] They called the film [...] "clever" [...] and [...] "tricky", and said about the actors, [...] "Otto Kruger makes a famous detective almost unbearably poignant; Nils Asther makes an innocent man, grilled as a murderer, a human being in agony; and Karen Morley makes the emotions of both men plausible." [...] Photoplay named it one of the best films of the month, and, like Motion <b>Picture</b> <b>Magazine,</b> named Kruger's performance one of the month's best. They called it [...] "A pretty perfect picture, all about the perfect crime, with Otto Kruger, Karen Morley, and Nils Asther turning in pluperfect performances." [...] The Motion Picture Herald gave the film a glowing review, calling it an [...] "intriguing, entertaining picture." [...] It went on to say, [...] In a novel way, it wraps up its amusement assets in a veil of semi-mystery and by the logical use of clever suspense moves to an odd climax that completely upsets all anticipations. Comedy tinged melodrama, therefore, is its essence, in which amusing thrill, not fear-mongering terror, predominates ... Inasmuch as the reasons for the perfect crime, its accomplishments and the turmoil it brings on, are evident to them and the investigator—all the other participants being in the dark—it remains for the unexpected anti-climax to overturn advance solutions. As the picture is convincingly acted, there never once being a hint as to the finale, realism builds a suspense that not only maintains continuous interest but makes gleeful mincemeat of all the amateur sleuths' logical conclusions.|$|E
