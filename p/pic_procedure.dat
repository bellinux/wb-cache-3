5000|$|Rotterdam Convention [...] - The {{objectives}} of the Rotterdam Convention are:• to promote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts among Parties in the international trade of certain hazardous chemicals {{in order to protect}} {{human health and the environment}} from potential harm;• to contribute to the environmentally sound use of those hazardous chemicals, by facilitating information exchange about their characteristics, by providing for a national decision-making process on their import and export and by disseminating these decisions to Parties. The text of the Convention was adopted on 10 September 1998 by a Conference in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The Convention entered into force on 24 February 2004. The Convention creates legally binding obligations for the implementation of the Prior Informed Consent (<b>PIC)</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E
40|$|Accounts {{of human}} {{suffering}} and environmental contamination in developing countries because of pesticide use often propose closing the knowledge gap between industrialized (pesticide-exporting) countries and developing (pesticide-importing) countries as a solution (Hough 1998). In such narratives, improved provision of information on pesticide risks and pesticide trade will enable developing countries to design and implement appropriate measures to control pesticide risks. This is the basic premise underlying the major global governance framework that addresses global pesticide flows, the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade (hereinafter “the convention”). Transparency, {{in the form of}} governance by disclosure through prior informed consent (PIC), is the key pillar of the emerging global system of pesticide regulation. The <b>PIC</b> <b>procedure</b> stipulates that industry in exporting countries is allowed only to export listed chemicals after receiving consent of the importing country. The Rotterdam Convention calls for the sharing of information between states about hazardous chemicals entering international trade and about the regulatory actions taken in participating countries (Rotterdam Convention 2008). A basic concern of the convention i...|$|E
40|$|Background Critical {{decisions}} {{and interpretation of}} observations by the nurse caring for the paediatric intensive care (PIC) patient can have dramatic and potential adverse impact on the clinical stability of the patient. A common <b>PIC</b> <b>procedure</b> is endotracheal tube (ETT) suction, however there is inconsistent evidence regarding the clinical indicators to guide and support nursing action. Justification for performing this procedure is not clearly defined within the literature. Further, {{a review of the}} literature has failed to establish clear standards for determining if the procedure is warranted, especially for paediatric patients. Objective The objective of the review is to identify current clinical indicators used in practice to determine why ETT suction should be performed. Method An integrative review using a systematic approach to summarise the empirical and theoretical evidence within the literature as it relates to clinical practice was used. Results Consensus of opinion indicates that ETT suctioning should only be performed when clinically indicated. There is no general consensus regarding which clinical indicators should be measured and used to guide the decision to perform ETT suctioning. Conclusion Research is required to identify the clinical indicators that could be used to design a valid and clinically appropriate tool to use to assist in the decision making process to perform ETT suction...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Productivity Interfirm Comparison (PIC) is {{a simple}} method used to improve {{productivity}} at the firm level, where a number of firms operate in the same product line so that performance information on the firms can be compiled and compared. This results in identifying potential areas for improvement or exploitation. The comparison may unearth performance inefficiencies that, over time, may have insidiously come {{to be regarded as}} acceptable when quite the contrary is true. Three Saudi cement firms participated in this research whose purpose was to determine the usefulness and applicability of PIC for firms in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected from the participating firms and converted to ratios which were represented graphically and discussed in detail. In spite of the differences between Saudi Arabia and the United States, it was found that PIC is useful to firms in Saudi Arabia and many benefits could be gained from its use. This includes use at the national level in applying PIC in all industries. Experience in its use could be gained by affiliating or contracting with productivity improvement and measurement centers and organizations. <b>PIC</b> <b>procedures</b> can also be conducted internationally...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and {{perioperative}} intraperitoneal chemotherapy (PIC) {{has improved}} survival in selected patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. This study evaluates the morbidity of postoperative pancreatic fistula (PF) {{within the context}} of CRS and PIC. Methods: Two hundred seventy-one consecutive CRS and <b>PIC</b> <b>procedures</b> were evaluated. Diagnosis and classification of postoperative PF were performed according to the international study group on PF criteria. The associations between 8 clinical and 20 treatment-related factors with postoperative PF were determined by univariate and multivariate analysis. The management and clinical sequelae of postoperative PF were discussed. Results: Seventeen patients (6. 3 %) developed postoperative PF. None of these patients died during their in-hospital stay. Multivariate analysis identified three independent risk factors for PF: Transfusion of ? 6 units of blood (P = 0. 029), operation duration of ? 9 h (P = 0. 035), and splenectomy (P = 0. 020). Conservative management of PF was instituted in all 17 patients and was successful in 16 (94 %). The overall time to PF closure was 26 (standard deviation 16) days after diagnosis. Although PF did not contribute to procedure-related mortality, it was associated with increased length of hospital stay (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: CRS and PIC presented an acceptable rate of PF that did not increase the procedure-related mortality. However, PF was associated with longer hospital stay. Most patients with PF were treated conservatively and did not require surgical intervention. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Aims: This {{study is}} the first to {{evaluate}} the clinical and treatment-related risk factors for perioperative toxicity and mortality in patients with peritoneal recurrence that underwent iterative cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with or without perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (PIC). The aim is to improve patient selection. Methods: Fifty-seven consecutive iterative CRS procedures were performed in 40 patients between June 2000 and September 2008. Forty-seven patients were administered PIC. Adverse events were rated from grades I to V with increasing severity. Grade I toxicity was self limiting; grade II required medical intervention; grade III required an invasive intervention; grade IV required returning to intensive care unit or operating theatre; and grade V resulted in patient death during hospital stay. Risk factors for grades III and IV/V toxicity were determined. Results: The mortality rate was 2 %. The grades III and IV/V toxicity rate was 18 % and 19 %, respectively. A peritoneal cancer index ≥ 16 (p = 0. 020), operation length ≥ 9 h (p = 0. 045), number of peritonectomy procedures ≥ 2 (p = 0. 045) and a suboptimal cytoreduction (p = 0. 031) were the risk factors for grade IV/V toxicity. Conclusions: Iterative CRS and <b>PIC</b> <b>procedures</b> have an acceptable rate of perioperative toxicity in carefully selected patients. Patients with high tumour burden requiring extensive surgical dissection are at highest risk of a severe adverse event. Thorough preoperative evaluation of patients is necessary to improve both perioperative and postoperative outcomes. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} problems associated with the transboundary movement of electronic waste (e-waste), a term that refers to end-of-life or discarded electrical and electronic equipment. These problems occur mostly in developing countries where proper facilities and technology for environmentally sound management of e-waste are not sufficiently available. The Basel Convention on the Control of the Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal is the only existing international treaty governing the electronic waste trade. However, the Basel Convention, which employs the Prior Informed Consent (<b>PIC)</b> <b>procedure</b> as a control system, exempts electronic assemblies destined for direct reuse, repair, refurbishment, or upgrading from its scope because trade in electronic materials for these stated purposes are not considered waste in some countries. This exception, although intended to protect and increase trade in second-hand products, also creates a loophole for illegal dumping, especially in developing countries where there is a high demand for these low-cost second-hand electronic products and materials. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is an alternative approach invented and used in many European and other developed countries to ensure a proper and effective ewaste management. EPR refers to the Polluter-Pays principle. In the case of electronic products, producers are deemed pollution generators because of their ability to change product design and control the substances used. EPR, therefore, extends the producers’ responsibility beyond the factory to the waste management stage when the products reach the end of their useful life. This dissertation explores and assesses the EPR approach as an alternative solution to the potential setbacks that have resulted from the Basel Convention’s exception and considers the possibility of adopting EPR as a standard policy principle on a national level...|$|E
40|$|The much publicised Trafigura case of {{the illegal}} dumping of {{hazardous}} petrochemical waste in and around Abidjan in Côte d’Ivoire has reignited {{the debate about the}} international trade in hazardous wastes as well as issues of international corporate social responsibility. The incident, which took place in August 2006, highlights major flaws in the existing international regulatory system, particularly around the prior informed consent (<b>PIC)</b> <b>procedure.</b> PIC forms the keystone of the 1989 Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes. This article focuses on the effectiveness of the PIC procedures under the Basel Convention {{in the light of the}} response to the Trafigura incident. The incident exemplifies the failures of the PIC system under the Basel Convention. It reveals confusion on the part of regulatory authorities, failure to take prompt and appropriate action by the authorities involved, a lack of proactive supervisory intervention on the part of the Basel Secretariat, and a more far-reaching lack of developing country support for capacity building and technical assistance. There is a need for a more thorough-going approach to the assessment of environmentally sound management in developing countries. More fundamentally, meaningful consent encompasses the human rights dimension of hazardous wastes on local communities. Efforts aimed at increasing co-operation between the Basel, Rotterdam, Stockholm and MARPOL Conventions should be fully supported but they should be rapidly complemented by addressing deficiencies at ‘the sharp end’ around compliance and the effectiveness of the current system of PIC. A more integrated multilateral environmental regime dealing with all aspects of hazardous chemicals and wastes is warranted based on a wider focus on common concern for the global environment...|$|E
40|$|Aim Interpretations of global-scale {{patterns}} in foliar N and P concentrations and N:P ratios across climatic gradients and biomes often ignore complications imposed by taxonomic and phylogenetic {{structure in the}} nutrient concentrations of the constituent taxa. We analysed foliar N and P concentrations and N:P ratios of species from similar climate zones, but with contrasting soil fertility, to determine {{the relative importance of}} phylogeny and geographic region in driving foliar nutrient concentrations. Location Mediterranean climate regions. Methods Mean foliar N and P concentrations of 564 species from five mediterranean climate regions were compiled. Regional comparisons of foliar N and P concentrations and N:P ratios were performed using a phylogenetically independent contrasts (<b>PIC)</b> <b>procedure.</b> We also evaluated phylogenetic structuring in these variables, determining for each clade whether (1) the mean trait value and (2) the variance in trait values deviate significantly from chance expectation. Results Foliar N and P concentrations were found to vary between regions, a result confirmed using PIC. Tests of phylogenetic structure identified lineages having unusually high or low N and P concentrations, these being largely consistent amongst two of the regions. There was a general pattern of conservatism in foliar N and P concentrations and N:P ratios with localized instances of overdispersion. Main conclusions Our findings identify soil fertility as a strong environmental filter which has led to the dominance of low-nutrient adapted lineages in the South African Cape and Western Australia. There is also a pronounced clade-specific 2 ̆ 7 stoichiometric homeostasis 2 ̆ 7 in foliar N and P concentrations and N:P ratios and this strong phylogenetic conservatism, together with the narrow range of foliar concentrations, is an evolutionary outcome of factors associated with developmental and physiological nutrient requirements specific to each lineage. Our results reinforce the need to include phylogenetic considerations in discussions of the biological stoichiometry of plants if we are to expand our current knowledge of foliar N and P concentrations and N:P patterns from an ecological to a biogeographic scale...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) {{combined}} with perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (PIC) has demonstrated improved survival in selected patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC). This treatment modality {{is associated with}} high blood loss and often requires massive allogenic red blood cell transfusion (MABT). Our study {{is the first of}} its kind to evaluate the risk factors for intraoperative MABT in peritonectomy procedures. Methods: Two hundred and forty-three consecutive CRS and <b>PIC</b> <b>procedures</b> were evaluated. The associations between 17 preoperative and intraoperative risk factors and intraoperative MABT (≥ 6 units) were assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: One hundred and eighty-six (77 %) procedures required intraoperative transfusion of packed red blood cells. Ninety-one procedures required MABT (37 %). Multivariate analysis showed six significant risk factors for intraoperative MABT: operative length > 9 h (p < 0. 001), preoperative hemoglobin < 125 g/l (p < 0. 001), operation date prior to 2004 (p = 0. 002), peritoneal cancer index ≥ 16 (p = 0. 006), preoperative international normalized ratio (INR) ≥ 1. 2 (p = 0. 008), and number of peritonectomy procedures ≥ 4 (p = 0. 021). Statistical analysis also revealed that MABT was associated with increased intensive care unit (ICU) (p < 0. 001), high-dependency unit (HDU) (p = 0. 020), and total hospital stay (p < 0. 001) and with severe morbidity (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Patients with preoperative anemia, impaired coagulation profile or extensive tumor burden are at high risk of MABT. Appropriate blood conservation strategies should be adopted in these patients on the basis of their risk factors. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) {{combined}} with perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (PIC) has demonstrated improved survival in selected patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). However, this aggressive treatment modality {{has been consistently}} associated with variable rates of perioperative mortality between 0 % and 18 % and morbidity between 30 % and 70 %. This study evaluates the clinical and treatment-related risk factors for perioperative morbidity and mortality in PMP patients who underwent CRS and PIC. Materials and Methods: A total of 145 consecutive CRS and <b>PIC</b> <b>procedures</b> for PMP performed between January 1996 and March 2009 were evaluated. The association of 12 clinical and 20 treatment-related risk factors with grades III and IV/V morbidity were assessed by univariable and multivariable analysis. Results: The mortality (grade V) rate was 3 %. The morbidity rates of grades III and IV were 23 % and 22 %, respectively. Eight factors were associated with grade IV/V morbidity on univariable analysis: Peritoneal cancer index ≥ 21 (P =. 034), ASA score ? 3 (P =. 003), operation duration ≥ 10 h (P <. 001), left upper quadrant peritonectomy procedure (P =. 037), colonic resection (P =. 012), ostomy (P =. 005), ileostomy (P =. 012), and transfusion ≥ 6 units (p = 0. 011). Multivariable analysis showed 2 significant risk factors for grade IV/V morbidity: ASA ≥ 3 (P =. 006) and an operation length ≥ 10 h (P <. 001). Conclusions: CRS and PIC has an acceptable rate of perioperative mortality and morbidity in selected patients with PMP. Patients with bulky disease who undergo a long operation are at a particularly high risk of a severe adverse event. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The Rotterdam Convention {{that was}} signed in Rotterdam on 10 September 1998 and entered into force on 24 February 2004 regroups {{currently}} 154 Parties. It introduced the Prior Informed Consent (<b>PIC)</b> <b>procedure</b> for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in International trade. The convention aims to promote shared responsibility and cooperative effort among Parties {{in order to protect}} {{human health and the environment}} from potential harm and to contribute to their environmentally sound use, by facilitating information exchange about their characteristics, by providing for a national decision-making process on their import and export and by disseminating these decisions to Parties. The European Union adopted the Rotterdam Convention by Council Decision 2006 / 730 /EC of 25 September 2006. Furthermore, Regulation (EC) No 689 / 2008 of the European Parliament and the Council of 17 June 2008 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals is the latest in a series of measures over the years that seek to address international trade with dangerous chemicals. This Regulation reaffirms the EU commitment towards ensuring proper control in the trade and use of dangerous chemicals at the global level, based on the principle that it should help to protect human health and the environment beyond its borders as well as within. Two linked processes were identified as characterising the PIC content management activities. They are analysed separately: the export notifications process and the explicit consents process. The export notifications process aims to identify uniquely the single administrative document clearing customs. The explicit consents process aims to explicitly exchange risk management information, between an exporting designated national authority and an importing one, prior to export of chemicals. Each process is first described. The functionalities supporting the process are listed and explained. The specific implication of the administrator in the process is then identified. Finally the liaison between both processes is analysed. Several working documents are annexed in order to transparently manage the hand over of the PIC content management activities to the European Chemicals Agency - ECHA. JRC.

40|$|The 1998 Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, {{which came}} into force in 2004, commits {{exporters}} of chemicals banned {{in their own}} countries because of their human or environmental toxicity to notify importers of this through a Prior Informed Consent <b>procedure</b> (<b>PIC).</b> The Convention made legally-binding Article 9 of the voluntary FAO’s 1986 International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides, inspired by the tragedy of the 1984 Bhopal chemical plant disaster. The establishment of PIC as a binding international rule was sealed by eventually gaining the support of the chemical industry in the early 1990 s, after they had opposed its inclusion even in the voluntary code, after a civil society campaign led by the Pesticides Action Network. The reason for this “U-turn” by the industry was a fear of the alternatives, such as an outright prohibition of the export of certain pesticides, a bill of which was debated in the United States during 1991 - 1992...|$|R
40|$|Open {{surgical}} versus endoscopic {{treatment of}} CBD stones in 80 elderly not cholecystectomized patients revealed a similar efficacy of stone clearance and early major complication rates, {{as well as}} total complication rates and hospitalization time {{in the two groups}} during 5 to 9 years follow-up. However, more patients in the endoscopically treated group died from heart disease, suggesting surgery to become the favoured treatment in this selected category of patients. Surgery was required in about 20 % and biliary related mortality was 3. 3 % in 184 not cholecystectomized patients undergoing EST for CBD stones and followed for in average 6 years. Cholecystectomy was required more often in patients with an open cystic duct at cholangiography as compared to those with a blocked duct. The incidence of biliary problems after EST for CBD stones in 135 patients with remote cholecystectomy was a low 3. 7 % during a mean follow-up of 7 years. Stone size over 10 mm or the complication of basket implication, were the only two factors found associated with a decreased bile duct clearance rate in 246 patients with CBD stones and the gallbladder in situ. No such risk factors were identified in 147 previously cholecystectomized patients. Routine preoperative infusion cholangiography (PIC) at elective cholecystectomy in 694 consecutive patients was not found to be warranted for identification of bile duct anomalies and a safe surgical <b>procedure.</b> <b>PIC</b> would need the support of peroperative cholangiography in about 20 % of patients in case of unsatisfactory opacification of the bile ducts (10 %) or unclear findings (10 %) at the PIC...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. The United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (UN-GHS) is {{developed}} to harmonize {{the criteria for}} hazard communication worldwide. The European Regulation on classification, labeling, and packaging of substances and mixtures [CLP Regulation (European Commission, EC) No 1272 / 2008] will align the existing European Union (EU) legislation to the UN-GHS. This CLP Regulation entered into force on January 20, 2009, and will, after a transitional period, replace the current rules on classification, labeling, and packaging for supply and use in Europe. Both old and new classifications will exist simultaneously until 2010 for substances and until 2015 for mixtures. Hazard classification. The new hazard classification will introduce new health hazard classes and categories, with associated new hazard pictograms, signal words, Hazard (H) -statements, and Precautionary (P) -statements as labeling elements. Furthermore, the CLP Regulation will affect the notification of product information on hazardous products to poisons information centers (<b>PICs).</b> Product notification <b>procedures.</b> At this moment product notification widely varies in procedures and requirements across EU Member States. Article 45 of the CLP Regulation contains a provision stating that the EC will (by January 20, 2012) review the possibility of harmonizing product notification. The European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) is recognized as an important stakeholder. For cosmetic products, the new Cosmetics Regulation will directly implement a new procedure for electronic cosmetic product notification in all EU Member States. Conclusion. Both the CLP Regulation and the Cosmetics Regulation will develop their own product notification procedure within different time frames. Harmonization of notification procedures for both product groups, especially a common electronic format, would be most effective from a cost-benefit viewpoint and would be welcomed by PICs...|$|R
