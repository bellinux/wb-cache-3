25|$|There are {{two main}} types of rock tumbling: barrel (rotary) tumbling, and {{vibratory}} tumbling. Rotary tumbling is more common, simpler, quieter and less expensive than vibratory tumblers. There are two differentiating factors, however, that may lead one to use a vibratory tumbler. First, vibratory tumbler retain the overall shape of the rough rock, whereas rotary tumblers tend to make rocks round. Thus, {{it is important to}} use vibratory tumbler to make faceted shapes and tear drop forms. Second, vibratory tumblers tend to process much faster than rotary tumblers, generally reducing the <b>process</b> <b>time</b> to half.|$|E

He explained his position to the Western Daily Press, stating that the show's producers had made a number of changes to the series without consulting him, and that in the <b>process</b> <b>Time</b> Team had been [...] "dumbed down", something he considered bad for archaeology. He was annoyed that a number of archaeologists—including surveyor Stewart Ainsworth, small finds specialist Helen Geake and illustrator Victor Ambrus—had seen their roles diminished while a new co-presenter, Mary-Ann Ochota (a former model with a bachelor's degree in archaeology and anthropology), had been introduced, and that as a result the episodes now contained [...] "a lot of faffing about."

40|$|Background. The {{effect of}} {{resident}} training in anaesthesiology on operating room (OR) econ-omics {{is an issue}} of debate. Comparisons of anaesthesia <b>process</b> <b>times</b> between residents and consultants might be systematically skewed by interactions of anaesthesia technique and patient factors. Methods. In this prospective, observational study, we analysed anaesthesia <b>process</b> <b>times</b> in 599 cases performed for four different surgical services in a University hospital. The following factors were recorded for each case and used in multivariate analyses of process times: age, American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) status, BMI, emergency status, the educational level of the anaesthetist, and the anaesthesia technique. Results. In the non-adjusted comparison, only for two of seven anaesthetic techniques did resident cases have statistically significant longer induction times than consultant cases: general anaesthesia with placement of a central venous catheter [mean (SD) anaesthesia time for resi-dent cases 38. 2 (17. 0) vs 22. 3 (10. 0) min for consultant cases, P 0. 001] and general anaesthe-sia with a laryngeal mask airway [resident cases 11. 3 (5. 5) vs consultant cases 7. 3 (5. 0) min, P 0. 003]. Anaesthetic technique had the greatest effect on anaesthesia induction time. Educational level of the anaesthetist and age of the patients had small, but significant effects. Conclusions. Anaesthesia cases performed by residents have in some, but not in all, anaesthe-sia techniques increased <b>process</b> <b>times</b> compared with cases performed by consultants. This limits a possible negative impact on OR economics by resident education. Patient-based factors including ASA status, BMI, and emergency status have minimal or no effect on anaesthesia <b>process</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R
