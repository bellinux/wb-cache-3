The spontanenous appearance of closed membranes composed of bilayers of self-assembling amphiphiles was likely a prerequisite for Darwinian competitive behavior to set in at the molecular level.

Here we describe bottom-up experiments simulating <b>prebiotic</b> environments that support the formation of simple amphiphilic molecules capable of self-assembling into vesicular objects on the micrometer scale.

40|$|Effect of <b>prebiotic</b> {{oligosaccharide}} extract rumbia fruit (Metroxylon sago Rottb.) in the ration on broiler performance ABSTRACT. <b>Prebiotic</b> oligosaccharides {{are thought}} to provide beneficial effects in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals by stimulating growth of selected members of the intestinal microflora. <b>Prebiotic</b> oligosaccharides are defined as nondigestible food ingredients that provide beneficial effects to the host by stimulating the growth of selected microbial members of the gastrointestinal tract. Among the colonic bacteria capable of metabolizing <b>prebiotic</b> oligosaccharides and whose growth is stimulated are species of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. <b>Prebiotic</b> oligosaccharides can be produced in transgli-cosylation reactions catalyzed by glycosidases. Glycosidases from different biological sources have specific ability to catalyze the formation of oligosaccharides with particular chain lengths (usually DP < 7) and predominant glycosidic linkages.

The objectives of this research were to study the performance of broiler given of <b>prebiotic</b> oligosaccharide extract rumbia fruit (metroxylon sago Rottb.) in the ration.
