5|$|The Normans {{retained}} {{and reinforced}} the manorial system with its division between demesne and peasant lands paid for in agricultural labour. Landowners could <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{sales of goods}} from their demesne lands and a local lord could also expect to receive income from fines and local customs, whilst more powerful nobles profited from their own regional courts and rights.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{became the}} {{administrative}} centre for the earldom {{and was used}} by Robert's court. There was already an existing market held at nearby St Stephen's church by the local canons, but Robert appropriated it and moved the market to outside his new castle, intending to <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> trade. A watermill was built to the south-west of the castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} to Golders Green {{would take the}} railway out of the urban and suburban areas and into open farmland. While this provided a convenient site for the CCE's depot {{it is believed that}} underlying the decision was Yerkes' plan to <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sale of development land previously purchased in the area that would rise in value when the railway opened.|$|E

5|$|Another {{analogous}} case {{within a}} single species has been termed Browerian mimicry (after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower). This {{is a case of}} bipolar (only two species involved) automimicry; the model is the same species as its mimic. Equivalent to Batesian mimicry {{within a single}} species, it occurs when there is a palatability spectrum within a population of harmful prey. For example, monarch (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. Some feed on more toxic plants, and store these toxins within themselves. The more palatable caterpillars thus <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> more toxic members of the same species.|$|E
5|$|In Moldavia, {{agriculture}} and animal raising remained the principal economic activities. Similarly to Wallachia, wooden plow remained the main agricultural tool throughout the Middle Ages. The constant clearing of land shows that finding new land was still preferred to crop rotation. The {{establishment of the}} principality enhanced the security of travel, thus Moldavia could also <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> transit trade between Poland and the Black Sea ports. The first local coins were minted in 1377, under Peter I Muşat (c.13751391).|$|E
5|$|In November 1897, the BS did a {{deal with}} the London & Globe Finance Corporation (L), a mining finance company {{operated}} by mining speculator Whitaker Wright and chaired by Lord Dufferin. The L was to fund and manage the construction, taking any <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> process. The cost of construction was estimated to be £1,615,000 (equivalent to approximately £ today). The L replaced the BS's directors with its own and let construction contracts. Wright made fortunes in America and Britain by promoting gold and silver mines and saw the BS as a way of diversifying the L's holdings.|$|E

5|$|The Apollo 1 cabin fire in January 1967 put manned spaceflight on hold. The crew of Apollo 7, {{designated}} to be {{the return}} to manned spaceflight, began working with the Robbins Company later in 1967 to produce commemorative mission medallions. Commissioned by the NASA Astronaut Flight Office (AFO), the medallions were financed entirely through the orders placed by astronauts and support crew personnel. Only those directly affiliated with the AFO were eligible as purchasers, and they were bound by their employment contract not to commercialize the medallions, as NASA was concerned about any appearance that the astronauts might <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> flown medallions.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian Economic Union must {{negotiate}} {{as a whole}} to sign {{free trade}} agreements with other countries. Key players for the Eurasian Economic Union are the European Union, Turkey, Iran, China and the Korean peninsula. The EEU has sought to increase its trade with partners in the Middle East and East Asia in order to <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> growing trade between Europe and Asia.|$|E
5|$|The {{sale of the}} {{training}} ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts. Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.|$|E

5|$|Bamber {{launched}} two legal actions {{while in}} prison {{to secure a}} share of the estate, which the cousins said was part of an attempt to harass and vilify them. In 2003 he began a High Court action to recover £1.2m from the estate of his adoptive grandmother, arguing that he should have inherited her home at Carbonnells Farm, Wix, Essex, which went instead to June's sister—the grandmother had cut Bamber out of her will when he was arrested—and that he was owed 17 years' rent from his cousins who lived there. In 2004 he went to the High Court again to claim a £326,000 share of the <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> caravan site. The court ruled against him.|$|E
5|$|Domestic sheep {{provide a}} wide array of raw materials. Wool {{was one of the first}} textiles, {{although}} in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for synthetic fabrics. For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without farm subsidies. Fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as wool insulation. In the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.|$|E
5|$|In 1258, Henry faced {{a revolt}} among the English barons. Anger had grown {{about the way}} the King's {{officials}} were raising funds, the influence of the Poitevins at court and his unpopular Sicilian policy; even the English Church had grievances over its treatment by the King. The Welsh were still in open revolt, and now allied themselves with Scotland. Henry was also critically short of money; although he still had some reserves of gold and silver, they were totally insufficient to cover his potential expenditures, including the campaign for Sicily and his debts to the Papacy. Critics suggested darkly that he had never really intended to join the crusades, and was simply intending to <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crusading tithes. To compound the situation, the harvests in England failed. Within Henry's court there was a strong feeling that the King would be unable to lead the country through these problems.|$|E

5|$|More acute {{threat to}} the Polish–Lithuanian state came from Sweden. The {{balance of power in}} the north had shifted in Sweden's favor, as the Baltic {{neighbor}} was led by King Gustavus Adolphus, a highly able and aggressive military leader, who greatly improved the effectiveness of the Swedish armed forces, while also taking advantage of Protestant zealotry. The Commonwealth, exhausted by the wars with Russia and the Ottoman Empire and lacking allies, was poorly prepared to face this new challenge. Continuous diplomatic maneuvering by Sigismund III made the whole situation look to szlachta like another stage in the King's Swedish dynastic affairs; in reality the Swedish power resolved to take hold of the entire Polish-controlled Baltic coast, and thereby <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth's maritime trade intermediary control, endangering its basis for independent existence.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, 1917, {{while still}} {{completing}} his military training, Johnson married Eunice Nichols. Their only child, a daughter named Judith, was born May 19, 1927. Upon {{his return from}} military service, Johnson purchased the Elizabethtown Mirror with financial assistance from his father. He built the struggling paper almost from the ground up, and a competitor soon bought him out for a profit. Johnson used the <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sale of the Mirror to continue his education at the University of Kentucky. While a student, {{he worked as a}} reporter for the Lexington Herald. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism in 1922. The university awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1940.|$|E
5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to act as {{if they are going to}} do something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E

5|$|The side left Christchurch and {{travelled}} north {{where they}} played Wairarapa in Masterton. The match was won 10–8, {{and the next}} day they faced Wellington, who they also defeated. The fixture against Wellington was nearly abandoned because Scott and the Wellington Rugby Union could not agree on a venue; the match went ahead only when the Wellington officials agreed to cede the Natives all <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> match. After this the Natives travelled to Auckland where they played their last match, against the province on 24 August. The match was lost 7–2 after each team scored two tries each, but the Aucklanders kicked a drop-goal and a conversion. The loss ended a remarkable run of matches– the Natives had a 31-game unbeaten streak in rugby matches that started with their victory over Widnes on 9 March; the side won 30, and drew one match between the defeats.|$|E
5|$|There were {{assertions that}} Odex had charged 10% {{interest}} for settlements paid through an instalment plan, but {{a press release}} by the company denied that it had required any such interest payments. By September 2007, 105 out of the 300 SingNet subscribers who had received letters had negotiated with and paid Odex, although, in a news conference, Odex said that it had neither forced payment from nor fined anyone. The company explained {{that it would not}} <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> enforcement process and intended to donate to charity any excess amount received. It would also release a financial audit of all the money collected at the close of proceedings. On 31 August 2007, in an attempt to address criticisms of late releases, Odex began to offer video on demand (VOD) on its relaunched website. Users could legally download and unlock a digital rights management (DRM)-protected anime episode at S$2 for seven days.|$|E
5|$|Meeker {{was born}} in Butler County, Ohio, to Jacob and Phoebe Meeker. His family {{relocated}} to Indiana {{when he was a}} boy. He married Eliza Jane Sumner in 1851; the following year the couple, with Ezra's brother and with their newborn son, set out for the Oregon Territory, where land could be claimed and settled on. Although they endured hardships on the Trail in the journey of nearly six months, the entire party survived the trek. Meeker and his family briefly stayed near Portland, then journeyed north to live in the Puget Sound region. They settled at what is now Puyallup in 1862, where Meeker grew hops for use in brewing beer. By 1887, his business had made him wealthy, and his wife built a large mansion for the family. In 1891 an infestation of hop aphids destroyed his crops and took much of his fortune. He later tried his hand at a number of ventures, and made four largely unsuccessful trips to the Klondike, taking groceries and hoping to <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gold rush.|$|E
