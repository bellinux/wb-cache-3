40|$|Abstract — an {{inrush current}} is a {{transient}} current with high amplitude that may {{occurs when a}} transformer is energized under no load or lightly loaded conditions. The magnitude of inrush current may {{be as high as}} several times of transformer rated current. The magnitude of inrush current depends upon leakage reactance, source strength, impendence of winding, residual flux. Inrush current causes huge mechanical and thermal stress on transformer in addition to <b>inadvertent</b> <b>operation</b> of the protective relay systems. The conventional method like pre-insertion of resistor, point on wave is used to minimize the inrush current. Inrush current in transformer can be reduced by selecting appropriate switching angle with respect to the remnant flux.

The requirements {{are aimed at}} enhancing {{the reliability of the}} protection system by enforcing the performance and documentation of all maintenance and testing tasks. Such tasks are usually time consuming and in many cases can render generation and transmission systems inoperable for extended periods of time. This project is aimed at the design, implementation and evaluation of an automated protection system monitoring (PSM) scheme. The system will perform checks on all relays, current and voltage transformers associated with generation system protection during normal steady state operation. The performance of each instrument transformer will be evaluated based on readings from adjacent devices in the system as well as historic data. The protection system includes generator, cable and generator step-up (GSU) transformer microprocessor (??P) relays. Data from all relays will be collected and analyzed via a real time automation controller (RTAC). The RTAC will evaluate the condition of all relays as well as associated voltage and current transformers to provide a report {{that can be used to}} meet PRC- 005 testing requirements and decrease system scheduled and unscheduled down time.

40|$|Following an {{assessment}} of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the Scotia Sea, CCAMLR established a precautionary catch limit of 4 million tonnes and further adopted 15 small-scale management units (SSMUs). The intent was to subdivide the precautionary catch limit for krill among the SSMUs so as to <b>preclude</b> the <b>inadvertent</b> concentration of catches in {{a small portion of}} the surveyed area. Five options for allocating the catch limit among the SSMUs in the Scotia Sea are presented in this paper. The first four are static allocations where the allotment of catch to an SSMU is proportional to: (i) the historical catch within the SSMU; (ii) estimated predator demand in the SSMU; (iii) estimated standing stock of krill in the SSMU; and (iv) standing stock less predator demand in the SSMU. The fifth option is a dynamic allocation based on land-based predator monitoring conducted just prior to, or early in, the fishing season. For the purposes of illustration and comparison between the options, parameter estimates are made using available data, although it is recognised that considerable refinement of these estimates is possible. Qualitative conclusions are that: under the first two options a substantial portion (> 65 %) of the catch limit would be allocated to three or less of the SSMUs adjacent to large concentrations of land-breeding predators; under options (iii) and (iv) a similar portion of the catch limit would be directed to pelagic SSMUs beyond the foraging range of these predators but into areas where krill fishing has not regularly occurred; and under option (v), an example of an adjustable catch limit dependent on the results of ecosystem monitoring, the fishery would be restricted in some of its traditional fishing grounds during years of low krill availability. Under all five options there would be little effect on the existing fishery However, as catches increase, a trade-off may be drawn between options that displace the fishery from its current operating area, but reduce the potential for contravening the terms of the Convention, and options that do not displace the fishery, but are likely to contravene the terms of the CCAMLR Convention...|$|R
40|$|Several new {{protective}} {{systems are}} being {{installed on the}} DIII D tokamak to increase the safety margins for plasma operations with injected ECH power at densities approaching cutoff. <b>Inadvertent</b> overdense <b>operation</b> has previously resulted in reflection of an rf beam back into a launcher causing extensive arcing and melt damage on one waveguide line. Damage to microwave diagnostics, which are located {{on the same side}} of the tokamak as the ECH launchers, also has occurred. Developing a reliable microwave based interlock to protect the many vulnerable systems in DIII-D has proved to be difficult. Therefore, multiple protective steps have been taken to reduce the risk of damage in the future. Among these is a density interlock generated by the plasma control system, with setpoint determined by the ECH operators based on rf beam trajectories and plasma parameters. Also installed are enhanced video monitoring of the launchers, and an ambient light monitor on each of the waveguide systems, along with a Langmuir probe at the mouth of each launcher. Versatile rf monitors, measuring forward and reflected power in addition to the mode content of the rf beams, have been installed as the last miter bends in each waveguide line. As these systems are characterized, they are being incorporated in the interlock chains, which enable the ECH injection permits. The diagnostics most susceptible to damage from the ECH waves have also been fitted with a variety of protective devices including stripline filters, thin resonant notch filters tuned to the 110 GHz injected microwave frequency, blazed grating filters and shutters.

40|$|Insertion of the Multi-Canister Overpack (MCO) {{assemblies}} {{into the}} Canister Storage Building (CSB) storage tubes {{involves the use}} of the MCO Handling Machine (MHM). During MCO storage tube insertion <b>operations,</b> <b>inadvertent</b> movement of the MHM is prevented by engaging seismic restraints (''active restraints'') located adjacent to both the bridge and trolley wheels. During MHM repositioning operations, the active restraints are not engaged. When the active seismic restraints are not engaged, the only functioning seismic restraints are non-engageable (''passive'') wheel uplift restraints which function only if the wheel uplift is sufficient to close the nominal 0. 5 -inch gap at the uplift restraint interface. The MHM was designed and analyzed in accordance with ASME NOG- 1 - 1995. The ALSTHOM seismic analysis reported seismic loads on the MHM uplift restraints and EDERER performed corresponding structural calculations to demonstrate structural adequacy of the seismic uplift restraint hardware. The ALSTHOM and EDERER calculations were performed for a parked MHM with the active seismic restraints engaged, resulting in uplift restraint loading only in the vertical direction. In support of development of the CSB Safety Analysis Report (SAR), an evaluation of the MHM seismic response was requested for the case where the active seismic restraints are not engaged. If a seismic event occurs during MHM repositioning operations, a moving contact at a seismic uplift restraint would introduce a friction load on the restraint {{in the direction of the}} movement. These potential horizontal friction loads on the uplift restraints were not included in the existing restraint hardware design calculations. One of the purposes of the current evaluation is to address the structural adequacy of the MHM seismic uplift restraints with the addition of the horizontal friction associated with MHM repositioning movements...|$|R
40|$|Political {{trials are}} {{generally}} understood as extraordinary {{events in the}} life of liberal democracies, dramatically staging claims to and contests over political authority and legitimacy. Notably, political trials often attract commentary on their theatrics whereby the spectacle becomes a matter of uneasy scrutiny, despite the tacit crosscultural acknowledgment that the trial is an inherently theatrical form. This thesis is an attempt to conceptualise the political operations and effects of the relation between performance and performativity in trials, treating these as separate but related terms. It proposes a new framework for studying political trials by drawing on theories of performativity (J. L. Austin, Jacques Derrida, Judith Butler, Shoshana Felman, Stanley Cavell) which assist not only in rethinking the role and effects of performance in trials, but also in introducing a multivalence to the meaning of ‘political’ in political trials. In other words, performative theory allows the formulation of the politics of trials beyond its standard conception in terms of the utilisation of legal procedure for political ends or expediency, instead attuning us to the unconscious processes, <b>inadvertent</b> gestures, ghostly <b>operations,</b> structural infelicities and other similar dynamics that recast the political effects of legal proceedings. This thesis is therefore an attempt to conceptualise the spectacles and spectres of justice at the intersection of law and politics. In addition to incorporating brief discussions of various 20 th and 21 st century political trials to develop this theoretical framework, it offers close studies of three cases: the 1921 Berlin trial of Soghomon Tehlirian, and two contemporary ‘deep state’ trials from Turkey – the Ergenekon trial, and the Hrant Dink murder trial. A sustained concern is with legacies of political violence, how they are addressed or contained by law, and how they are perpetuated by law...|$|R
