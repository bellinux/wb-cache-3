At a Southern Hemisphere subtropical site (27. 6 °S, 151. 9 °E), the dynamic range of the filtered <b>polysulphone</b> allowed measurements of erythemal exposures to approximately 100 minimum erythemal dose (MED) for a change in optical absorbance at 330 nm (ΔA 330) of 0. 35.

A <b>polysulphone</b> calibration curve for each field experiment was obtained by measuring the ambient UV dose under almost clear sky conditions and the corresponding change in the PS film absorbance, prior and post exposure.

To analyse the role of complement in this interaction, fresh plasma, heat inactivated and zymosan-activated plasma were added: with fresh plasma oxygen radical production was stimulated on cuprophan, cellulose acetate and <b>polysulphone,</b> not modified on polycarbonate, and decreased on polyacrilonitrile and polymethylmethacrylate. With heat-inactivated plasma, the responses were decreased or abrogated on all the membranes except polycarbonate and polymethylmethacrylate, whereas with zymosanactivated plasma similar responses to fresh plasma were observed. In addition, when plasma was used to precoat the membrane, cuprophan, cellulose acetate and <b>polysulphone</b> disclosed an enhanced neutrophil oxidative burst, while precoated polyacrilonitrile and polymethylmethacrylate were less stimulatory than uncoated membranes.

The reactor contains 30 internally skinned <b>polysulphone</b> membranes as an immobilization matrix for xylanase, the degrading agent, and was constructed with stainless steel to withstand high temperatures, as Thermomyces lanuginosus SSBP xylanase has an optimum temperature of 50 °C. Overall, 85. 1 % of the xylanase was immobilized onto the <b>polysulphone</b> membranes by adsorption. Preliminary {{results showed that the}} immobilized enzyme was capable of degrading the xylan effluent. Prior to contact with xylanase, there was 0. 0 μg ml- 1 xylose, 14. 2 μg ml- 1 xylobiose and 7. 2 μg ml- 1 xylotriose present in the xylan effluent. After 180 min, the xylose, xylobiose and xylotriose concentrations were 246, 103 and 91 μg ml- 1, respectively. Substantial increase in degradation products is promising {{for the development of a}} larger-scale bioreactor for effluent treatment. Articl...|$|E
40|$|The captive bubble {{method was}} used to {{describe}} the wetting characteristics of a number of commercial ultrafiltration (UF) membranes. The membranes belonged to one of two homologous (same material, different cut-off) series made by the same manufacturer. One series was made of <b>polysulphone</b> and the other one of cellulose triacetate. The porosimetric characteristics of the membranes have also been measured. The combined data were used to explain the fouling behaviour of the membranes upon ultrafiltration of solutions containing dextran, whey protein concentrate and silicate sols. The cellulose triacetate series is characterized by lower receding contact angle and smaller contact angle hysteresis and shows better flux behaviour (permeate flux during UF and pure water flux recovery at the end of UF) than the <b>polysulphone</b> series. Within the same series the mean permeability pore size shows a better correlation with membrane flux behaviour than with contact angle hysteresis...|$|E
40|$|Miniaturised {{ultraviolet}} (UV) dosimeters {{have been}} manufactured from <b>polysulphone</b> film adhered to lightweight cardboard frames measuring 15 mm by 10 mm {{with a clear}} circular aperture of 6 mm. The <b>polysulphone</b> film cast to a thickness of 40 μm was calibrated to the erythemally effective ultraviolet measured by a scanning spectroradiometer (Bentham Instruments, Reading UK) located at the University of Southern Queensland Toowoomba campus. The small, flexible miniaturised UV dosimeters were attached to the vertex, forearm and upper back of golfers and office workers during a series of 9 -hole golf rounds run between February through to July 2008. The calibrated erythemally effective UV exposures were compared between the office workers and golf players. Results are presented for the golfers and office workers measured over varying solar zenith angles and weather conditions. The UV exposures of both groups measured in the period are further compared to recommended thresholds of UV for daily occupational exposure and for healthy vitamin D 3 synthesis...|$|E
