Another regression model of shape <b>pre-setting</b> <b>control</b> for the 6 -high reversing cold rolling mill was established {{based on the results}} of the influence function method [111]. The regression models possess the advantages of simple structure and high calculation speed. Based on the mechanism model, Bai, et al. [112], divided shape pre-setting course into two steps, namely rough calculation step and precise calculation step, and a set of optimization algorithm was proposed to improve calculation speed. Wang [2] developed the models and softwares of shape <b>pre-setting</b> <b>control</b> for cold rolling strip according to the basic model of shape theory, which was successfully applied to multiple sets of cold rolling mills. The models and softwares are characterized by the strip element method. Under the premise of ensuring model accuracy, the calculation speed is improved significantly by the multistep optimization strategy. The pre-setting calculation time is less than 1 s.|$|E
30|$|The {{shape control}} {{system can be}} divided into <b>pre-setting</b> <b>control</b> system and {{closed-loop}} control system according to the control sequence, and the modelling of shape control system includes mechanism and intelligent models. <b>Pre-setting</b> <b>control</b> is a predictive control, and closed-loop control is a monitoring control. The two control systems complement each other and ensure the strip shape quality. The mechanism models are based on solid theoretical basis and have strong expansibility, {{but it is hard to}} realize accurate modelling and fast calculation. The intelligent models demonstrate strong learning capability, fast calculation speed, and simple modeling but poor analyticity and scalability. Coordination between these two models can effectively improve the control level. The shape control system of cold rolling strip is a complex control system with multiple variables, strong coupling, and nonlinearity. For a long time, the whole set of shape control system can only be provided by German’s SIEMENS, Japan’s MITSUBISHI, or other large international companies. In the past 10 years, several new computer control systems are developed for the cold rolling strip. Its industrial applications have achieved good results [107 – 109].|$|E

Traditional <b>pre-setting</b> <b>control</b> method based on data statistical can not meet the complex needs of the current traffic control. Aiming at this issue, we propose traffic control mechanism based on fuzzy logic. The technology real-time gets the situation of traffic according {{to a series of}} fuzzy inference rules that is pre-setting to achieve optimal control of the traffic situation. Experiments show that this method not only can improve the passage efficiency of intersection, but also provide more predicted result as well compared to the network-based control methods...|$|E
