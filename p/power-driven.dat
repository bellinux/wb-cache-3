She performs training missions involving shiphandling, maneuvering, navigation, and towing, as well as participating in Merchant Marine Academy public relations trips throughout Long Island Sound, the East River, and New York Harbor. The vessel is operated by crews of midshipmen participating in the Academy's Power Squadron, a fleet of <b>power-driven</b> vessels used for everything from fishing to long-range trips.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with her}} main and {{secondary}} batteries, Duke of York carried 48 QF 2 pdr (...) Mk.VIII [...] "pom-pom" [...] anti-aircraft guns in six octuple, <b>power-driven,</b> mountings. These were supplemented by six [...] Oerlikon light AA guns in single, hand-worked, mounts.|$|E
500|$|In Europe, Major Ernest Swinton, sent to France as an army war correspondent, {{very soon}} saw the {{potential}} of a track-laying tractor. [...] He proposed to Sir Maurice Hankey, Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, that the British build a <b>power-driven,</b> bullet-proof, tracked vehicle that could destroy enemy machine-guns. Holt tractors were [...] "the inspiration {{for the development of}} the British tank." ...|$|E
500|$|During the war the two single Oerlikon mounts on {{the bridge}} wings were {{replaced}} by twin <b>power-driven</b> mounts and the two remaining single mounts aft were superseded by two single [...] Bofors AA guns before the ship sailed for the Far East. In preparation for her reclassification as a training ship, Pietermaritzburg had her sweeping gear removed and was rearmed with her main armament replaced by a twin-gun turret fitted with more powerful 4-inch Mk XVI guns in 1961–62. The Bofors guns were moved {{to the roof of}} the enlarged aft superstructure. Her complement now consisted of 8 officers, 73 ratings, 10 midshipmen and 50 trainees. She was refitted in 1971.|$|E
500|$|Twenty-four [...] 78-caliber light {{anti-aircraft}} guns {{were to be}} carried by the Stalingrads in six quadruple SM-20-ZIF <b>power-driven,</b> fully enclosed mounts. Two mounts were fitted {{on each side of}} the forward funnel and the last two were superimposed above the rear main gun turret. Each individual gun weighed [...] and the complete mount weighed [...] The guns in this mount could depress to −13° and elevate to 85° at a rate of 25° a second. Traverse speed was 30° per second. The gun fired [...] shells at a muzzle velocity of [...] to a maximum horizontal range of [...] Its rate of fire was 75 rounds per minute and 800 rounds were carried for each gun.|$|E
500|$|Malcolm and Angus Young {{developed}} {{the idea for}} the band's name after their sister, Margaret Young, saw the initials [...] "AC/DC" [...] on a sewing machine. [...] "AC/DC" [...] is an abbreviation meaning [...] "alternating current/direct current" [...] electricity. The brothers felt that this name symbolised the band's raw energy, <b>power-driven</b> performances of their music. [...] "AC/DC" [...] is pronounced one letter at a time, though the band are colloquially known as [...] "Acca Dacca" [...] in Australia. The AC/DC band name is stylised with a high voltage sign separating the [...] "AC" [...] and [...] "DC" [...] and has been used on all studio albums, {{with the exception of the}} international version of Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.|$|E
500|$|English {{rock group}} the Yardbirds {{recorded}} [...] "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] {{during their first}} American tour in 1965. [...] It is based on Johnny Burnette's adaptation, but Beck biographer Annette Carson comments their [...] "propulsive, <b>power-driven</b> version, however, deviated radically from the original... recording plucked the old Rock & Roll Trio number from obscurity {{and turned it into}} a classic among classics". [...] The Yardbirds' lead guitarist Jeff Beck, who is a fan of early rockabilly, said that he introduced the song to the group: [...] "They just heard me play the riff, and they loved it and made up their version of it". [...] Giorgio Gomelsky, the group' first producer, states that Sonny Boy Williamson II's use of blues harp to imitate train sounds during his 1963 UK tour with the Yardbirds also inspired the band's adaptation of the song.|$|E
500|$|A single [...] twin-gun Modèle 1933 {{anti-aircraft}} mount {{was installed}} on the rearmost deckhouse forward of turret Nr. 3. It used the 50-caliber semi-automatic [...] gun. It had a conventional sliding breech and used six-round cartridge boxes which gave it a maximum rate of fire of only 30-40 rounds per minute. This mount was used {{in lieu of the}} intended <b>power-driven</b> Modèle 1935 twin-gun mount which was to use a new 48-caliber, fully automatic 37mm gun that was expected to be able to fire at a rate of 165 rounds per minute, but the new gun was still in development when the ships were commissioned. 250 rounds were stored near the mount, but the main magazine, which held an additional 1,250 rounds, was adjacent to the forward 138mm magazines. This required a loader to move forward [...] to pick up each [...] cartridge box and carry it back to the waiting gun crew.|$|E

2500|$|Norwegian-style modern whaling, {{based on}} the use of <b>power-driven</b> vessels, cannons and {{exploding}} harpoons, was introduced in the Meiji period largely through the efforts of Jūrō Oka who is considered the [...] "father of modern Japanese whaling". Oka traveled the world gathering information about whaling practices including to Norway for harpoons, cannons and expertise. He also established the first modern whaling company in Japan in 1899, Nihon Enyo Gyogyo K.K. which took its first whale on February 4, 1900, with a Norwegian gunner, Morten Pedersen.|$|E
2500|$|The Hatsuharu-class destroyers {{used the}} same 50 caliber 12.7cm gun as the Fubuki class, but all turrets could elevate to 75° to give the main guns a minimal ability to engage aircraft. During the war the single turret was removed on all {{surviving}} ships after 1942. The only anti-aircraft guns were two water-cooled, license-built Vickers 40-millimeter guns. These guns were deemed to be too heavy, slow-firing and short-ranged and were replaced by license-built French Hotchkiss [...] Type 96 anti-aircraft guns in single, double and triple mounts from 1943 for the surviving ships. Exact numbers are not always known, but [...] was carrying three triple <b>power-driven</b> mounts, including one mounted {{in lieu of the}} single 12.7cm gun turret, one twin <b>power-driven</b> mount fitted on a platform in front of the bridge and two hand-worked single mounts in June 1944. These powered mounts were unsatisfactory because their traverse and elevation speeds were too slow to engage high-speed aircraft and more single mounts were fitted to ships {{in the last year of}} the war. For example, [...] mounted ten single 25guns when she was lost in July 1945. Four license-built Hotchkiss [...] Type 93 machine guns were also fitted to Hatsushimo, but these were of limited utility against modern aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The Tribals, {{including}} Gurkha had a main gun armament {{of eight}} 4.7-inch (120mm) QF Mark XII guns in four twin <b>power-driven</b> mounts. Separate Low-Angle and High-Angle gun directors were fitted for anti-ship and anti-aircraft fire, although the guns could only elevate to 40 degrees, which was {{judged to be}} sufficient for long-range anti-aircraft in defence of a fleet. High level air-attack was not judged {{to be a threat}} against fast and manoeuvrable ships like destroyers. Close-in anti aircraft armament consisted of a quadruple 2-pounder [...] "pom-pom mount and two quadruple Vickers [...]50 machine guns. Torpedo armament consisted of a power-operated quadruple bank of 21-inch (530mm) torpedo tubes. Anti-submarine armament consisted of two depth charge throwers and one rack, with a total of 30 depth charges carried.|$|E
2500|$|Milling is {{the complex}} shaping of metal or other {{materials}} by removing material {{to form the}} final shape. It is generally done on a milling machine, a <b>power-driven</b> machine that in its basic form consists of a milling cutter that rotates about the spindle axis (like a drill), and a worktable that can move in multiple directions (usually two dimensions [...] relative to the workpiece). The spindle usually moves in the z axis. [...] It is possible to raise the table (where the workpiece rests). [...] Milling machines may be operated manually or under computer numerical control (CNC), and can perform {{a vast number of}} complex operations, such as slot cutting, planing, drilling and threading, rabbeting, routing, etc. Two common types of mills are the horizontal mill and vertical mill.|$|E
2500|$|The use of clepsydrae {{to drive}} {{mechanisms}} illustrating astronomical phenomena {{began with the}} Han Dynasty polymath Zhang Heng (78-139) in 117, who also employed a waterwheel. Zhang Heng {{was the first in}} China to add an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel, which solved the problem of the falling pressure head in the reservoir tank. Zhang's ingenuity led to the creation by the Tang dynasty mathematician and engineer Yi Xing (683–727) and Liang Lingzan in 725 of a clock driven by a waterwheel linkwork escapement mechanism. The same mechanism would be used by the Song dynasty polymath Su Song (1020–1101) in 1088 to power his astronomical clock tower, as well as a chain drive. Su Song's clock tower, over [...] tall, possessed a bronze <b>power-driven</b> armillary sphere for observations, an automatically rotating celestial globe, and five front panels with doors that permitted the viewing of changing mannequins which rang bells or gongs, and held tablets indicating the hour or other special times of the day. In the 2000s, in Beijing's Drum Tower an outflow clepsydra is operational and displayed for tourists. It is connected to automata so that every quarter-hour a small brass statue of a man claps his cymbals.|$|E
60|$|The dining-room of the International Hotel was modern, {{but while}} noisy, <b>power-driven</b> fans stirred the heavy {{air and the}} {{decoration}} was profuse, traces of more austere ancient art remained. Stone pillars and the fretted arch at one end had an Eastern grace and lightness; among the gaudy modern lamps hung one or two finely-modeled in copper and burning scented oil. The glass and nickeled knives were American, but curious old carafes filled with red and yellow wine stood among the flowers and fruit on the long table.|$|E
6000|$|Carl {{was full}} {{member of the}} circle because of his tales of the Bowery and the Great Riley Show, and because he pretended to be rather an {{authority}} on motors for dirigibles, about which he read in Aeronautics at the Y. M. C. A. reading-room. It is true that at this time, early 1907, the Wrights were still working in obscurity, unknown even in their own Dayton, though they had a completely successful machine stowed away; and as yet Glenn Curtiss had merely developed a motor for Captain Baldwin's military dirigible. But Langley and Maxim had endeavored to launch <b>power-driven,</b> heavier-than-air machines; lively Santos Dumont had flipped about the Eiffel Tower in his dirigible, and actually raised himself from {{the ground in a}} ponderous aeroplane; and in May, 1907, a sculptor named Delagrange flew over six hundred feet in France. Various crank inventors were [...] "solving the problem of flight" [...] every day. Man was fluttering {{on the edge of his}} earthy nest, ready to plunge into the air. Carl was able to make technical-sounding predictions which caught the imaginations of the restless children.|$|E
60|$|Already {{before the}} release of atomic energy the {{tensions}} between {{the old way of}} living and the new were intense. They were far intenser than they had been even at the collapse of the Roman imperial system. On the one hand was the ancient life of the family and the small community and the petty industry, on the other was a new life on a larger scale, with remoter horizons and a strange sense of purpose. Already it was growing clear that men must live on one side or the other. One could not have little tradespeople and syndicated businesses in the same market, sleeping carters and motor trolleys on the same road, bows and arrows and aeroplane sharpshooters in the same army, or illiterate peasant industries and <b>power-driven</b> factories in the same world. And still less it was possible that one could have the ideas and ambitions and greed and jealousy of peasants equipped with the vast appliances of the new age. If there had been no atomic bombs to bring together most of the directing intelligence of the world to that hasty conference at Brissago, there would still have been, extended over great areas and a considerable space of time perhaps, a less formal conference of responsible and understanding people upon the perplexities of this world-wide opposition. If the work of Holsten had been spread over centuries and imparted to the world by imperceptible degrees, it would nevertheless have made it necessary for men to take counsel upon and set a plan for the future. Indeed already there had been accumulating for a hundred years before the crisis a literature of foresight; there was a whole mass of 'Modern State' scheming available for the conference to go upon. These bombs did but accentuate and dramatise an already developing problem.|$|E
60|$|The {{mechanical}} revolution, {{the process}} of mechanical invention and discovery, was a new thing in human experience and it went on regardless of the social, political, economic and industrial consequences it might produce. The industrial revolution, on the other hand, like most other human affairs, was and {{is more and more}} profoundly changed and deflected by the constant variation in human conditions caused by the mechanical revolution. And the essential difference between the amassing of riches, the extinction of small farmers and small business men, and the phase of big finance in the latter centuries of the Roman Republic on the one hand, and the very similar concentration of capital in {{the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries}} on the other, lies in the profound difference in the character of labour that the mechanical revolution was bringing about. The power of the old world was human power; everything depended ultimately upon the driving power of human muscle, the muscle of ignorant and subjugated men. A little animal muscle, supplied by draft oxen, horse traction and the like, contributed. Where a weight had to be lifted, men lifted it; where a rock had to be quarried, men chipped it out; where a field had to be ploughed, men and oxen ploughed it; the Roman equivalent of the steamship was the galley with its bank of sweating rowers. A vast proportion of mankind in the early civilizations were employed in purely mechanical drudgery. At its onset, <b>power-driven</b> machinery did not seem to promise any release from such unintelligent toil. Great gangs {367} of men were employed in excavating canals, in making railway cuttings and embankments, and the like. The number of miners increased enormously. But the extension of facilities and the output of commodities increased much more. And as the nineteenth century went on, the plain logic of the new situation asserted itself more clearly. Human beings were no longer wanted as a source of mere indiscriminated power. What could be done mechanically by a human being could be done faster and better by a machine. The human being was needed now only where choice and intelligence had to be exercised. Human beings were wanted only as human beings. The drudge, on whom all the previous civilizations had rested, the creature of mere obedience, the man whose brains were superfluous, had become unnecessary to the welfare of mankind.|$|E
