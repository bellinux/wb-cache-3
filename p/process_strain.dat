Similarities between the axial ratios of chondrules (1. 9 - 2. 0) and of the whole meteorite (2. 0) indicate either that Leoville deformed homogeneously or that it deformed as a framework of touching chondrules. This amount of strain corresponds to approximately 33 percent uniaxial shortening, assuming constant volume, and is likely to have been caused by compaction due to overburden from progressive accretion on the chondrite body.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Although many studies have evaluated quality characteristics of fresh, minimally processed, and processed carrots, none have concentrated on attributes affecting strained carrot quality. This study was initiated to investigate the effects of genotype, environment, and processing conditions on strained carrot quality. Genotypic response contributed to <b>processed</b> <b>strained</b> carrot quality. Relationships between sensory attributes and chemical components for ten genotypes of strained carrots were developed. Fresh carrot aroma, flavor, and aftertaste were associated with high sugar to terpinolene ratios. Cooked carrot attributes were associated with elevated levels of terpenoids. Results indicated that breeders should select lines with increased sugar content and reduced levels of volatile terpenoids. Environmental factors affected chemical attributes and influenced <b>processed</b> <b>strained</b> carrot quality. Carrots grown under reduced sunlight had elevated levels of volatile terpenoids and reduced levels of total sugars. Processors should consider selection of lines more resistant to unfavorable environmental conditions. Processing conditions also affected strained carrot quality. Thermal processing decreased volatile terpenoid levels while greatly increasing soluble phenolic content. Changes in Hunter color values indicated darkening, presumably the result of Maillard browning. Preprocessing operations and degree of thermal processing affected quality of strained carrots. Processors should reduce the time and temperature that strained carrots reside in batch and holding tanks to control color degradation, phenolic polymerization and loss of sugars. Preprocessing blanching operations reduced volatile terpenoid content 60 - 75 %. Strained carrots need thermal processing treatments with mineral time and temperature conditions to maintain commercial sterility, but prevent color degradation and phenolic depolymerization...|$|R

Based on 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain CH 12 was identified as Bacillus sp. Decolorization efficiencies were significantly enhanced with carbon (≥ 98 %) and organic nitrogen (∼ 100 %) supplements. Complete decolorization was also observed under anoxic and anaerobic conditions, and at the temperature of 30  °C and the pH of 10. However, the azo dye decolorization efficiency of strain CH 12 was significantly reduced when NaNO 3 (1 – 8 %) was supplemented or under aerobic culturing condition (≤ 6 %), indicating that RR 239 was less preferred electron acceptor. Overall, strain CH 12 can be a promising candidate for decolorization applications due to its potential to effectively decolorize higher RR 239 concentrations (50 − 250  mg/L) and six additional dyes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust and efficient surface flattening approach based on fitting a woven-like mesh model on a 3 D freeform surface. The fitting algorithm {{is based on}} tendon node mapping (TNM) and diagonal node mapping (DNM), where TNM determines {{the position of a}} new node on the surface along the warp or weft direction and DNM locates a node along the diagonal direction. During the 3 D fitting <b>process,</b> <b>strain</b> energy of the woven model is released by a diffusion process that minimizes the deformation between the resultant 2 D pattern and the given surface. Nodes mapping and movement in the proposed approach are based on the discrete geodesic curve generation algorithm, so no parametric surface or pre-parameterization is required. After fitting the woven model onto the given surface, a continuous planar coordinate mapping is established between the 3 D surface and its counterpart in the plane, based on the idea of geodesic interpolation of the mappings of the nodes in the woven model. The proposed approach accommodates surfaces with darts, which are commonly utilized in clothing industry to reduce the stretch of surface forming and flattening. Both isotropic and anisotropic materials are supported...|$|E

This technique incorporates well-established silicon processing technology e. g., ion implantation and thermal oxidation. A dilute GeSi layer is initially formed by implanting Ge+ into a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate. Thermal oxidation segregates the Ge at the growing oxide interface to form a distinct GexSi 1 -x thin-film with a composition that can be tailored by controlling the oxidation parameters (e. g. temperature and oxidation ambient). In addition, the film thickness can be controlled by implantation fluence, which is important since the film forms pseudomorphically below 2 × 1016 Ge/cm 2.

40|$|Incremental {{sheet forming}} (ISF) is a {{flexible}} {{process in which}} sheet metal is formed by a progression of localized deformation. However, the overall mechanics is complicated and special conditions, such as bending under tension, cyclic bending & unbending, and shear deformation occur during the process which contribute to the overall enhancement of formability. The research investigates the deformation mechanisms in ISF with relation to necking and failure. A strain-based forming limit criterion is widely used in sheet-metal forming industry to predict necking. However, this criterion is strictly valid only when the strain path is linear throughout the deformation <b>process.</b> <b>Strain</b> path in ISF is often found to be severely nonlinear throughout the deformation history. Therefore, the practice of using a strain-based forming limit criterion often leads to erroneous assessments of formability and failure prediction.
