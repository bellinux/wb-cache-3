5|$|In his {{doctoral}} thesis, Ehlers <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> duality symmetry {{between different}} {{components of the}} metric of a stationary vacuum spacetime, which maps solutions of Einstein's field equations to other solutions. This symmetry between the tt-component of the metric, which describes time as measured by clocks whose spatial coordinates do not change, and a term known as the twist potential {{is analogous to the}} aforementioned duality between E and B.|$|E

Ike Clanton's account of the game (the only one that exists) gives the participants as John Behan, Virgil Earp, Ike Clanton, Tom McLaury, and a fifth man Ike did not recognize, while Barra wrote that Holliday had attended the game.|$|E

A 13-episode anime adaptation, {{directed}} by Yūji Yanase and produced by Asahi Production, aired in Japan between July and September 2014. Critics <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> general focus on humiliation and shame, and panned it for its characters and reliance on a single joke throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|During the hearing, Hurcomb <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> letter {{published}} in The Times in July 1944, {{in which the}} Bishop and Dean of Durham, and Warden of the Durham Colleges, had given the misleading impression that the proposed station would ruin views from the railway line, an idea compounded by the publication {{a few days later}} of a photograph taken from the proposed site. He acknowledged that a number of views from parts of the river would be ruined, and that the station would be visible from the Cathedral and church, Hurcomb emphasised {{that the majority of the}} beautiful views around the city would remain. Pepler also found that from the railway station, the power station and the Cathedral could not be viewed simultaneously. The members of the inquiry initially concluded that the station should be given the go-ahead, based on the grounds that a more suitable site could not be decided upon.|$|E

25|$|At the Solvay conference, the {{question}} of quantizing other motions was raised, and Lorentz <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> problem. If you consider a quantum pendulum whose string is shortened very slowly, the quantum number of the pendulum cannot change because at no point is there a high enough frequency to cause a transition between the states. But {{the frequency of the}} pendulum changes when the string is shorter, so the quantum states change energy.|$|E
25|$|The Russian {{historian}} Yuri Felshtinsky {{compared the}} takeover of the Russian State by the siloviki to an imaginary scenario of the Gestapo coming to power in Germany after World War II. He <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> fundamental difference between the secret police and ordinary political parties, even totalitarian ones, such as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: Russia's secret police organizations are wont to employ the so-called active measures and extrajudicial killings. Hence, they killed Alexander Litvinenko and directed Russian apartment bombings and other terrorism acts in Russia to frighten the civilian population and achieve their political objectives, according to Felstinsky.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} Pei Songzhi <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> {{discrepancy between}} Zhang He's biography and the biographies of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao {{about the time}} when Zhang He defected to Cao Cao's side. According to Cao Cao and Yuan Shao's biographies, Yuan sent Zhang He and Gao Lan (高覽) to attack Cao's main camp per Guo Tu's suggestion. They defected to Cao Cao when they learnt that Wuchao was lost, and their defection resulted in Yuan Shao's defeat. Based on these two accounts, Zhang He defected to Cao Cao before Yuan Shao's defeat at the Battle of Guandu. On the other hand, Zhang He's biography mentioned that Zhang defected to Cao Cao after Yuan Shao's defeat at Guandu and after Guo Tu slandered him.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} have <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> problem facing Aristotle's theory of soul-body hylomorphism. According to Aristotle, a living thing's matter is its body, which needs a soul {{in order to}} be alive. Similarly, a bronze sphere's matter is bronze, which needs roundness {{in order to be}} a sphere. Now, bronze remains the same bronze after ceasing to be a sphere. Therefore, it seems that a body should remain the same body after death. However, Aristotle implies that a body is no longer the same body after death. Moreover, Aristotle says that a body that has lost its soul is no longer potentially alive. But if a living thing's matter is its body, then that body should be potentially alive by definition.|$|E
25|$|Alexander was {{a lifelong}} {{dedicated}} and gifted birdwatcher, keenly {{involved in the}} twentieth century movements for the protection and observation of birds. Along with two of his older brothers, Wilfred and Christopher, he took a keen interest in nature. Growing up in a Quaker home devoid of any other forms of entertainment, he found an interest in birds from the age of eight, when his older brother Gilbert gave him a book on natural history. In his autobiography he traced the precise origin of his interest in birds to 8.45 am on 25 March 1897, when an uncle <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> singing chiffchaff in their garden. It was not until he was 20 that he obtained his first pair of binoculars. He was one {{of a small group of}} amateur birdwatchers who developed the skills and set new standards for combining the pleasures of birdwatching with the satisfaction of contributing to ornithological science. He made many significant observations, mainly in Britain but also in India and the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} of centuries of social injustice through the caste system (see below, {{in the next}} Section) is not accepted by those who {{point out that the}} caste system, although differently known and practised in different societies, is a tribal hangover from the past, which had some merit in that it ensured, or 'reserved', specified jobs to be done castes which had a preference to do so. They have no sanction in the Vedas (the Upanishads Section) in which only speak of four broad 'Varnas' or divisions according to the temperament of people and of inter-Varna switch, or mobility, based on individual efforts when he/she happens to be borne to a man of a particular Varna. This process, called 'Samskara' is, approximately, conscious individual refinement. In a true sense, therefore, the talk of deliberate subjugation of or discrimination of upper castes against lower castes has no basis, even though distortions of the principle has happened historically, without sanction of the Vedas. Hence reservation, the anti-reservationists seem to say, is just a mask for demanding reservations under the cloak of casteism over-riding merit and blissfully ignoring that Vedas do not sanction this. At any rate, after several decades of Varna reservation for the lowest social strata comprising certain classes constitutionally enshrined as 'scheduled castes' and 'scheduled tribes', and otherwise open competition to all people irrespective of any criteria other than merit and aptitude, there is no justification for the political parties to demand extend reservation of educational admission and job opportunities to more classes ('other backward castes'). It is pointed out that more opportunities in keeping with the uncontrolled growth in population, in all spheres of economic activity as well as education, will be the only right answer and not reservation. However, since proportional representation is the basis of modern democracy as it is practised, these anti-reservationists point out, this, in India, has led to its most abominable abuse, resulting in a democracy which is of and by Indians but against their own interests, since a disunited country oblivious of equality of opportunity because of prohibitive reservation levels, can never compete successfully in the global context, nor achieve much in its own management of internal economy.(Already due to politicisation of trade unions, India's labour productivity remains among the lowest in the world, as a UK study had <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> few years ago.) The abuse of political power to demand reservation for all other than the so-called 'forward ' communities is, according to the contesters, just a vote bank politics to woo the majority represented by the beneficiary communities to cast their votes in their favour. Since, however, there are no opponents among political parties to educational and job reservations, in view of their universal vote bank politics, such reservation in themselves cannot favour any particular parties at the elections.|$|E
