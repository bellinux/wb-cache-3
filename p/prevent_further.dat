Manila was occupied by Japanese forces on January 2, 1942.|$|E

During a memorial ceremony on January 12, President Obama announced that earlier that day Giffords had opened her eyes {{for the first time}} since the attack.|$|E

The district of Kreuzberg, in particular, was targeted in this respect, with movement throughout this portion of the city in effect restrained completely (for instance the subway line 1 was shut down).|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{attacks on}} the Mariana Islands during 1944 and 1945 did not seriously disrupt the USAAF's {{strategic}} air campaign against Japan. They did, however, force the United States to allocate forces to defend the islands in order to <b>prevent</b> <b>further</b> losses of expensive B-29s. Moreover, due to {{the high cost of}} the heavy bombers, the ratio of losses was in favor of the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|Zinc has an {{electron}} configuration of 3d104s2 {{and is a}} member of the group 12 of the periodic table. It is a moderately reactive metal and strong reducing agent. The surface of the pure metal tarnishes quickly, eventually forming a protective passivating layer of the basic zinc carbonate, , by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide. This layer helps <b>prevent</b> <b>further</b> reaction with air and water.|$|E
5|$|After {{its second}} landfall, {{additional}} floods occurred in several towns, and in Sinaloa over 100,000people were rendered homeless and four people died. As {{a result of}} Manuel's impacts, 107municipalities were declared disaster regions. Damage in Sinaloa totaled MXN$500million (US$37.9million). The Mexican Army was dispatched in several locations to aid in post-tropical cyclone relief operations. Following the storm, looting in heavily impacted areas became commonplace, and as such government forces were also dispatched to <b>prevent</b> <b>further</b> looting. Overall, 123people {{lost their lives in}} Mexico while damage exceeded MXN$55billion (US$4.2billion).|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of {{evaluating}} {{a wide range of}} alternative plans to address the ship's problems (as well as other issues at San Jacinto), TPWD, working with many of the stakeholders at the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site, adopted a Master Plan that called for placing Texas into a permanent dry berth. After the Master Plan was formally adopted by TPWD in 2004, the Texas Legislature was approached to secure appropriate funding. The Legislature allowed the voters of Texas to express their opinion and on 6 November 2007 Texas voters approved $25 million in funds to dry-berth the ship to <b>prevent</b> <b>further</b> deterioration from the corrosive waters of the ship channel.|$|E
