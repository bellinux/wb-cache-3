40|$|It {{is shown}} that it is {{possible}} to introduce determinism into quantum mechanics by tracing the probabilities in the Born rules back to pseudorandomness in the absolute <b>phase</b> <b>constants</b> of the wave functions. Each wave function is conceived to contain an individual phase factor exp(iα). In an ensemble of systems the <b>phase</b> <b>constants</b> α are taken to be pseudorandom numbers. A reduction process (collapse), independent of any measurement, is conceived to be a spatial contraction of two wavepackets when they meet and satisfy a certain criterion. The criterion depends on the <b>phase</b> <b>constants</b> of both wavepackets. The measurement apparatus fans out the incoming wavepacket into spatially separated eigenpackets of the observable and a reduction associates the point of contraction with an eigenvalue of the observable.

40|$|Determinism is {{established}} in quantum mechanics by tracing the probabilities in the Born rules {{back to the}} absolute (overall) <b>phase</b> <b>constants</b> of the wave functions and recognizing these <b>phase</b> <b>constants</b> as pseudorandom numbers. The reduction process (collapse) is independent of measurement. It occurs when two wavepackets overlap in ordinary space and satisfy a certain criterion, which depends on the <b>phase</b> <b>constants</b> of both wavepackets. Reduction means contraction of the wavepackets {{to the place of}} overlap. The measurement apparatus fans out the incoming wavepacket into spatially separated eigenpackets of the chosen observable. When one of these eigenpackets together with a wavepacket located in the apparatus satisfy the criterion, the reduction associates the place of contraction with an eigenvalue of the observable.

40|$|Periodically {{nonuniform}} coupled microstrip line (PNC-ML) {{loaded with}} transverse slits is characterized using the fullwave {{method of moments}} and short-open calibration technique. Guided-wave characteristics of both even- and odd-modes are thoroughly investigated in terms of two extracted per-unit-length transmission parameters, i. e., <b>phase</b> <b>constants</b> and characteristic impedances. As such, frequency-dependent coupling between {{the lines of the}} finite-extended PNCML is exposed via two dissimilar impedances. Meanwhile, two <b>phase</b> <b>constants</b> try to be equalized at a certain frequency by properly adjusting the slit depth and periodicity, aiming at realizing the transmission zero. Further, equivalent J-inverter network parameters of this finite-length PNCML are derived to reveal the relationship between the transmission zero and harmonic resonance. By allocating this zero to the frequency twice the fundamental passband, one-stage and two-stage PNCML filters are then designed, fabricated and measured to showcase the advantageous capacity of the proposed technique in harmonic suppression.

The rates of hybrid-ization followed second-order kinetics and were measured spectrophotometrically in solution and fluorometrically in the solid phase. In solution, the rate constants for the model sequences varied by almost two orders of magnitude, with {{a decrease in the}} rate constant with increasing amounts of second-ary structure in the target sequence. The random sequences also showed over an order of magnitude difference in the rate constant. In contrast, the hybrid-ization experiments in the solid phase with the same model sequences showed almost no change in the rate <b>constant.</b> Solid <b>phase</b> rate <b>constants</b> were approximately three orders of magnitude lower com-pared with the solution <b>phase</b> <b>constants</b> for seq-uences with little or no single-stranded structure.

40|$|An {{efficient}} OFDM peak {{to average}} power ratio (PAPR) reduction method using linear phase variation is proposed. Applying linear phase variations to subblocks of subcarriers {{is equal to}} cyclic shifting the corresponding time signals and thus can prevent “peak collisions”.

40|$|The {{theory of}} coupled modes in distributed-parameter systems is {{developed}} {{in terms of}} matrices whose elements are functions of the coupling parameters between the modes and of the <b>phase</b> <b>constants</b> of the modes. The coupling parameters are the coupling coefficients for particular kinds of defect, multiplied by {{the magnitude of the}} defect, and vary with distance along the transmission system as the magni-tude of the defect varies; the <b>phase</b> <b>constants</b> may also vary with distance. Both coupling parameters and <b>phase</b> <b>constants</b> may be complex in general. A formula is obtained relating the input and output amplitudes of the coupled modes by a matrix T, and this is applied to the design of transitions with no coupling between the modes and no reflections, and to the design of directional couplers. Desired performances lead to conditions on the elements of T, and thus to conditions to be satisfied by the coupling parameters, from which design methods can be deduced. By regarding time as the analogue of distance, and frequency as the analogue of wave number, the theory may readily be applied to time-varying systems, and its applications to parametric amplifiers and the calculation of transition probabilities between atomic energy levels are pointed out.
