5|$|The Collections {{include a}} unique <b>proof</b> <b>sheet</b> of 26 Revenue 1765 Newspaper and Pamphlet one penny {{impressions}} showing the registration certificate, {{held in the}} Board of Inland Revenue Stamping Department Archive. These were issued to apply the Stamp Act of 1765 intended to raise taxes to fund the defence of the American Colonies from the French. The tax applied to legal documents, licences, newspapers, pamphlets and almanacs in the American Colonies, Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Florida, the Bahamas and the West Indian Islands. The taxes resulted in public protest and rioting. The tax was abandoned {{after a few months}} due to its unpopularity but the political damage contributed to the War of Independence in 1775.|$|E
25|$|The fourth letter, {{addressed}} to William Fitzwilliam, was written following Burke's reading of William Eden's Some Remarks on the Apparent Circumstances of the War in the Fourth Week of October 1795. When Pitt's {{government tried to}} negotiate peace with France, Burke stopped composing the letter and instead published what became the first two letters, called Two Letters on a Regicide Peace. Burke attempted to rewrite the letter to Fitzwilliam, {{but he did not}} finish before dying. The 1812 edition of his works did include a copy of the fourth letter that was pieced together from a manuscript copy by Burke, an uncorrected manuscript, and parts of the third letter's <b>proof</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A Division or Branch of the Special Collections Department is The Comic Art Collection. [...] The Comic Art Collection holds over 200,000 items. It is {{the largest}} library comic book {{collection}} in the world. While {{the bulk of the}} collection is made up of American comic books, it also includes over 1,000 books of collected newspaper comic strips, nearly 15,000 comics from other countries, and several thousand books and periodicals about the subject. The major focus of the collection is on collecting published work, in its effort to give a complete view of the 20th century. Comics are currently the largest and fastest-growing special collection at the MSU Libraries. Its coverage of comic strips was significantly enhanced with the donation in 2007 of the King Features <b>proof</b> <b>sheet</b> collection consisting of roughly one million sheets containing about two million individual strips (a duplicate set was donated to Ohio State University's Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum). In addition, the same year retired Professor Richard Webster of the University of Toledo donated his collection of one million comic strips collected from around the world during the 1960s. The Comic Art Collection accepts unannounced donations. Materials not accepted into the collection are sent to another appropriate library or sold to support endowment funds for the Comic Art Collection.|$|E

60|$|This was an overstatement. He was {{comparatively}} free of work, press day {{having only}} just gone by; {{but he was}} keenly anxious to avoid conversation {{on the subject of}} cats, of his ignorance of which Mr. Jarvis's appearance had suddenly reminded him. He took up an old <b>proof</b> <b>sheet</b> and began to glance through it, frowning thoughtfully.|$|E
60|$|The {{first part}} of my story about the Greek poets went to the 'Athenaeum' some days ago, but, {{although}} graciously received by the editor, it won't appear this week, or I {{should have had a}} <b>proof</b> <b>sheet</b> (which was promised to me) before now. I must contrive to include all I have to say on the subject in three parts. They will admit, they tell me, a fourth if I please, but evidently they would prefer as much brevity as I could vouchsafe. Only two poets are in the first notice, and twenty remain--and neither of the two is Gregory.|$|E
60|$|I do not know, Sir, {{whether you}} are a {{subscriber}} to Grose's Antiquities of Scotland. If you are, the inclosed poem will not be altogether new to you. Captain Grose did me the favour to send me a dozen copies of the <b>proof</b> <b>sheet,</b> of which this is one. Should you have read the piece before, still this will answer the principal end I have in view: it will give me another opportunity of thanking you for all your goodness to the rustic bard; and also of showing you, that the abilities you have been pleased to commend and patronise, are still employed {{in the way you}} wish.|$|E

6000|$|... "MY LORD,--An {{absence of}} some days, {{passed in the}} country, has [...] {{prevented}} me from writing earlier in answer to your obliging letter. I [...] have now, however, the pleasure of sending under a separate cover, the [...] first <b>proof</b> <b>sheet</b> of your Lordship's 'Poem', which is so good as to be [...] entitled to all your care to render perfect. Besides its general [...] merit, there are parts, which, I am tempted to believe, far excel [...] anything that your Lordship has hitherto published, and it were [...] therefore grievous indeed, {{if you do not}} condescend to bestow upon it [...] all the improvement of which your Lordship's mind is so capable; every [...] correction already made is valuable, and this circumstance renders me [...] more confident in soliciting for it your further attention.|$|E
6000|$|Thank {{you again}} and again for your praise of the ballad, which both delighted and {{surprised}} me ... as I had scarcely hoped that you might like it at all. Think of Mr. Tilt's never sending me a <b>proof</b> <b>sheet.</b> The consequences are rather deplorable, and, if they had occurred to you, might have suggested a deep melancholy for life. In my case, I, who am, you know, hardened to sins of carelessness, simply look aghast at the misprints and mispunctuations coming in as a flood, and sweeping away meanings and melodies together. The annual itself is more splendid than usual, and its vignettes have illustrated my story--angels, devils and all--most beautifully. Miss Mitford's tales (in prose) have suffered besides by reason of Mr. Tilt--but are attractive and graphic notwithstanding--and Mr. Horne has supplied a dramatic poem of great power and beauty.|$|E

5000|$|The {{next morning}} she tells him, [...] "All my life I've felt like I was here and somewhere {{else at the}} same time." [...] While looking at a <b>proof</b> <b>sheet</b> of photos taken on Véronique's recent trip to Poland, Alexandre notices {{what he thinks is}} a photo of Véronique, but she assures him it is not her, that she in fact took the photo—of a young Polish woman {{carrying}} a music folder. Véronique crumples the <b>proof</b> <b>sheet</b> and breaks down in tears. Alexandre comforts her and they make love again. Later at his apartment, Véronique sees Alexandre working on a new marionette with her image. When asked about the purpose of a second identical marionette, Alexandre explains, [...] "I handle them a lot when I perform. They get damaged easily." [...] He shows her how to work the one marionette while the double lays lifeless on the table.|$|E

60|$|Finally, I wish {{to express}} the great debt I owe to the late Mr. J.

50|$|He {{undertook}} to print official forms and handbills {{as well as}} almanacs. The surviving (1796) almanac was printed in 1795. As he also printed almanacs {{for at least the}} years 1795 and 1797, so he would likely have started his printing in 1794 or before but none of his earlier work has been discovered. His almanac did not bring him any great financial reward, having been used by many to copy out of by hand, notwithstanding some factual errors relating to dates of lunar eclipses. Only one copy of the first leaf is known to exist in the Sir George Grey Collection of the South African Library and this one may be a <b>proof</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|E
5000|$|His {{drawings}} {{were all}} of an historical character, among the best being [...] "Luther reading his Sermon to some Friends", [...] "The Death of Wickliffe", [...] "George Fox preaching in a tavern" [...] and [...] "Caxton examining the first <b>proof</b> <b>sheet</b> from his press". Wehnert's large works, though excellently conceived and drawn, were unattractive in colour and did not readily find purchasers. He was more successful as a designer of book illustrations. Among the many for which he furnished the drawings were Grimm's Fairy Tales (1853); Keats's Eve of St. Agnes (1856); Coleridge's Ancient Mariner (1857); The Pilgrim's Progress (1858); Hans Christian Andersen's Fairy Tales (1861); Robinson Crusoe (1862); and Edgar Allan Poe's Poetical Works (1865).|$|E

25|$|To {{gain access}} to the Press Photo Archives in Buea one is {{required}} to write an application to the corresponding authorities. There are no hard copies of photographic prints as the archives contain only negatives and <b>proof</b> <b>sheets.</b> There is no equipment to print the negatives. It is also difficult to access the material that was digitised by African Photography Initiatives with support from the British Library’s Endangered Archives Program and the Swiss Federal Office of Culture. With the support of a team six Cameroonians and in collaboration with the Ministry of Communication between 2013 and 2015, over 25,000 negatives and 14,000 <b>proof</b> <b>sheets</b> were digitised, a database established and conservation measures carried out. There is a pending offer of the British Library to make the digitised material available on their website but permission by the Ministry of Communication had not been granted by early 2017. Bamenda and Buea Universities have requested copies but no permission for this was yet forthcoming.|$|R
2500|$|On 3 July 1851, Bentley offered Melville ₤150 and [...] "half profits", that is, {{half the}} profits that {{remained}} after {{the expenses of}} production and advertising. On 20 July, Melville accepted, after which Bentley drew up a contract on 13 August. Melville signed and returned the contract in early September, {{and then went to}} New York with the <b>proof</b> <b>sheets,</b> made from the finished plates, which he sent to London by his brother Allan on 10 September. For over a month, these proofs had been in Melville's possession, and because the book would be set anew in England, he could devote all his time to correcting and revising them. He still had no American publisher, so the usual hurry about getting the English publication to precede the American was not present. Only on 12 September was the Harper publishing contract signed. Bentley received the <b>proof</b> <b>sheets</b> with Melville's corrections and revisions marked on them on September 24. He published the book less than four weeks later.|$|R
