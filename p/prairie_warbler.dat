50|$|This {{species is}} a {{moderately}} small New World warbler. It measures 11 to 13 cm {{in length and}} spans 16 to 20 cm across the wings. Body mass in adult birds can range from 6.6 to 12.6 g, though weights have reportedly ranged up to 15 g prior to migration. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 5.4 to 6.4 cm, the tail is 4.6 to 5.2 cm, the bill is 0.8 to 1 cm and the tarsus is 1.7 to 1.85 cm. The magnolia warbler can be distinguished by its coloration. The breeding males often have white, gray, and black backs with yellow on the sides; yellow and black-striped stomachs; white, gray, and black foreheads and beaks; distinct black tails with white stripes on the underside; and defined white patches on their wings, called wing bars. Breeding females usually have {{the same type of}} coloration as the males, except that their colors are much duller. Immature warblers also resemble the same dull coloration of the females.

One species specifically, the <b>prairie</b> <b>warbler</b> (Setophaga discolor), {{relies on the}} early-successional shrubland habitat that is potentially enhanced by these forestry management techniques. The objective {{of this study was}} to predict breeding-season habitat occupancy of prairie warblers within the New Jersey Pine Barrens on unmanaged lands as compared to private and state lands that have been purposely thinned and or managed with fire. One hundred and fifty counts were conducted at 18 study areas, 9 managed (75 point counts) and 9 unmanaged (75 point counts), from 11 June- 3 August, 2012. Vegetation characteristics were measured at point counts including percent and type of ground cover, forest basal area, vertical vegetation profile, and canopy coverage. We used program PRESENCE to build occupancy models to explain <b>prairie</b> <b>warbler</b> presence in the Pine Barrens, and evaluated the models using Akaike Information Criterion. Out of the 13 detection models only time of day model had ??AICc ??? 2 and this variable was used in further occupancy models assessing habitat characteristics. Of the 36 a priori variable habitat occupancy models that were assessed, only two had ??AICc ??? 2 (Table 2). These were model averaged and accounted for 53. 5 % of the AICc weight. Therefore the top predictive model for <b>prairie</b> <b>warbler</b> occupancy = - 2. 391 (canopy coverage) ??? 3. 039 (% grass) + 1. 460 (% understory at 2 m) + 1. 487 (% baresoil). For sites where prairie warblers were detected I found that percent understory coverage at 2 m was higher and percent canopy coverage and grassland were lower. Bare soil had a negligible effect due to large unconditional variance. Our results suggest that to increase <b>prairie</b> <b>warbler</b> occupancy management techniques should focus on providing more early successional shrubland habitat.

Some shrubland bird species were more abundant on narrower ROWs or at sites with lower vegetation or particular types of vegetation, indicating that vegetation management could be refined to favor species of high conservation priority. Also, several species were more abundant in ROWs traversing unfragmented forest than those near residential areas or farmland, indicating that corridors in heavily forested regions may provide better habitat for these species. In the area where we monitored nests, brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) occurred more frequently close to a residential area.

40|$|As shrubland bird populations decline, {{there is}} a {{critical}} {{need to understand the}} effects of habitat management. I studied a population of color-banded prairie warblers (Setophaga discolor) between 2008 - 2011 in a shifting mosaic landscape within a Massachusetts inland, pitch pine-scrub oak barren consisting of persistent, newly created, succeeding, and disturbed habitats. I present data showing that the abundance and population structure at this site appears to be a function of colonization of newly created habitat by second-year birds, which are likely excluded from mature early-successional habitat by site-faithful older birds. Breeding season fecundity did not differ significantly between newly-created and mature habitats. Birds displaced by mowing or fire dispersed to nearby suitable habitat the following year, had relatively similar reproductive success, and did not negatively affect pairing or reproductive success in adjacent areas. My findings are novel and show that the effects of shrubland management on shrubland birds are beneficial in the short- and long-term. I also examined <b>prairie</b> <b>warbler</b> nest-site selection and nest survival in relation to plant leafing phenology and other factors. Prairie warblers selected distinct nest sites and certain attributes of these selected sites increased nest survival; thus I conclude that nest-site selection is adaptive.

40|$|Abstract: In the Mississippi Coastal Plain of {{the southeastern}} United States, we {{explored}} relationships among bird spe-cies and vegetation types and landscape characteristics at four different scales. We modeled abundance of priority avian species from Breeding Bird Surveys using land class metrics at 0. 24, 1, 3, and 5 -km extents. Our modeling method was logistic regression and model selection was based on Akaike’s Information Criteria and validation with reserved data. Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), northern parula (Parula americana), Swainson’s warbler (Limnothlypis swainsonii), <b>prairie</b> <b>warbler</b> (Dendroica discolor), hooded warbler (Wil-sonia citrina), and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) had models containing positive area or core area variables.

Acadian flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), red-bellied woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus), wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), and yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens) had positive edge density mod-els. Modeling at different scales produced more complete habitat associations for most species and landscape variables were more influential at larger extents than the smallest extent. Although Mississippi is heavily forested, the landscape is unexpectedly fragmented, with small areal extents of vegetation types.

40|$|Nocturnal {{behaviors}} and sleep patterns of nesting passerines remain largely undocumented {{in the field}} and are important to understanding responses to environmental pressures such as predation. We used nocturnal video recordings to describe activity and quantify behaviors of females with nestlings of four shrub land bird species and three grassland bird species (n = 19 nests). Among the shrubland birds, Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora pinus), <b>Prairie</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Setophaga discolor), and Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea) returned to the nest for the night at the same time, around sunset. Among the grassland birds, Eastern Meadowlark (Stumella magna) returned the earliest before sunset and Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) returned the latest after sunset. All species exhibited 2 ̆ 2 back sleep 2 ̆ 2 with the bill tucked under scapular feathers, and individuals awoke frequently for vigils or 2 ̆ 2 peeks 2 ̆ 2 at their surroundings.

This study focused on habitat use by six early successional bird species in the Champlain Valley in Vermont along powerline ROWs. Thirty sites that included potential habitat were established. During the breeding season, trained citizen scientist volunteers spot-mapped species distribution patterns along transects. Focal habitat use by individuals was mapped during timed field observations (n= 83). Vegetation species composition and structure was evaluated within 1 m 2 vegetation plots across each site (n= 965).

While the covariates that influenced habitat use patterns by the species were similar, the effect size and direction of influence varied.

A total of 41 bird species were recorded; of these, 12 were considered early successional specialists. A positive relationship between clearcut size and avian species richness was found (r 2 = 0. 6975, P< 0. 05), indicating that the number of species was higher in larger clearcuts than in smaller openings. Clearcut size had a significant effect on the relative abundance on four of the five early successional species; Hooded Warbler abundance was not affected by clearcut size. Statistical analysis of reproductive success was difficult to achieve because of the low number of nests found (n= 51). My results suggest that even-aged treatments of different size in a large forest matrix had a positive effect on early successional birds.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Extremes {{of weather}} {{conditions}} and resulting variation in water conditions were noteworthy this spring. The west was very dry, but the Rainwater Basin had ample rains resulting in excellent breeding conditions for various waterbirds, notably Eared Grebe and American Coot. Shorebird numbers were unremarkable, {{although there was}} plenty of variation between species. Indeed, Dunlin, with record numbers, and Ruddy Turnstones were numerous. Arrival dates were pushing early but not record early. Species earlier than average were American Golden-Plover, Mountain Plover, Black-necked Stilt, White-rumped Sandpiper, and Stilt Sandpiper. Increasingly associated with wetlands, albeit unrelated to water levels, Greater Prairie-Chicken continued to use grassy margins of wetlands in the Rainwater Basin for lek sites. Leks were also noted in agricultural fields. Use of these habitats suggests ability to adapt and bodes well for the future of this species in southeast Nebraska, where it is also doing very well in its traditional native grassland habitats. Red-shouldered Hawks are being reported away from the traditional breeding site at Fontenelle Forest, the only site known in the state. Other species continuing range expansions and increasing in numbers are Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Carolina Wren, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, and Summer Tanager. It was a fun spring for rarity-seekers, with a putative first state record Zone-tailed Hawk, one of fewer than 5 records on the Great Plains north of the breeding range, a state 7 th record Curve-billed Thrasher, found, appropriately, by the state 2 ̆ 7 s Non-game Bird Program Manager, and a 9 th state record Golden-crowned Sparrow.

40|$|Early-successional {{bird species}} are showing {{alarming}} declines across the Northeast {{and particularly in}} New England. Utilizing limited resources to the best advantage of these declining bird species is a vital task for land managers. In 2006 and 2007, I collected bird abundance and habitat information from 87 points in early-successional habitat in Connecticut. The objective of this effort was to evaluate {{the relationships between the}} habitat variables collected at a plot using the point intercept method and the associated bird abundance at the plot. A second objective was to compare two different methods of characterizing early-successional habitat in explaining the variance in bird abundance. A plot-based method based on the BBIRD protocol from Montana Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit and the point intercept method were compared. Finally, I designed and created a database written in Microsoft Access which was used to standardize data entry, aid in the sharing of data and to calculate summary statistics to assist habitat managers in making conservation decisions. The habitat variables were grouped according to composition and structure to analyze bird-habitat relationships. Low broadleaved shrubs, broadleaved shrubs, fern/forbs, conifers, broadleaved trees and invasives, as well as average height for shrubs and trees were used for the analysis. Nine focal early-successional species that are showing general trends of decline were chosen from the list of all birds seen or heard. Bird abundance and detectibility covariates were modeled with the habitat variables using N-mixture models (2004). Up to 24 % of the variation of the best models (based upon AICc) was explained by the predictors I investigated. Five of the 9 birds showed a positive correlation to a shrub category variable. Fern/forbs, graminoids and invasives were found to exert less influence on the abundance of these scrub-shrub birds. Results indicated that the date of the survey affected the detectibility of only 5 of the species, and vegetation height only affected one of the species. Overall correlations indicate that these nine shrubland dependent species utilize a structurally complex habitat including broadleaved shrubs less 2 meters in height and than 2 - 5 meters in height and herbaceous forbs and graminoids. Invasive plants were found to be positively correlated to 2 of the 9 species possibly warranting additional work on the affects of these species on early-successional birds. Thirty-one of the total 87 point count points were selected for the comparison between the BBIRD and point intercept method. I choose six focal early-successional species for the analysis: indigo bunting, blue-winged warbler, chestnut-sided warbler, yellow warbler, <b>prairie</b> <b>warbler</b> and the common yellowthroat. The point intercept and BBIRD methods explained on average the same amount of variability in the data, and models from each data set included nearly the same number of variables, on average. Thus, we conclude these two vegetation sampling methodologies were essentially equivalent in summarizing important characteristics of scrub-shrub bird habitats. In the field, the BBIRD method took on average almost twice as long to complete as the point intercept method. Because in this study the two methods were similar in the amount of the bird abundance variance they explained and because the BBIRD method takes substantially longer to complete, I recommend that the point intercept method be considered an acceptable method for managers to use to characterize the relationships between early-successional bird species and their habitat. An important step in the successful conservation of declining early-successional bird species is the creation of database management systems and the coordination and cooperation amongst agencies that can stem from the use of these databases. The database I created ensures standardized data entry for data collected from multiple sites over many years. The database takes this data and can be queried for whatever particular information a manager needs. Percent cover of vegetation and invasives, average height of vegetation, and bird abundance are summarized and graphically displayed by the database. Ease of operation, ability to query and ability to share the information makes this database an important tool in the successful conservation of declining specie...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} shrubland and young {{forest in the}} Northeast, USA, has {{declined}} rapidly since the mid- 1900 ’s. Accordingly, the abundance of wildlife that depends on young forest has also declined. For example, American woodcock (Scolopax minor), an upland shorebird species, require an appropriate spectrum and spatial configuration of young forest to thrive and their populations have declined significantly since at least 1968. Active forest management is required to conserve populations of American woodcock and other young forest wildlife, but the importance of young forest management to {{some aspects of the}} ecology of key wildlife are not fully understood. I investigated three aspects of American woodcock ecology in relation to young forest management in Rhode Island, USA. First, I monitored the daytime locations of radiomarked American woodcock to assess habitat selection at multiple scales in relation to young forest management. Second, I also monitored American woodcock movements between daytime and nighttime locations and quantified food availability and predator activity at these sites to test the foraging-benefit and predation-risk hypotheses that were proposed to explain American woodcock commuting behavior. Third, I compared landbird communities at managed forest openings used by breeding American woodcock and nearby random forest sites to determine whether American woodcock habitat management benefits non-target landbirds and so verifies adopting American woodcock as an umbrella species useful for conservation. Daytime habitat selected by American woodcock comprised areas of younger forest where the biomass of preferred food (i. e., earthworms [Haplotaxida]) was 1. 7 – 3. 1 times greater, and the density of shrub and sapling stems was two times greater, compared to random sites. American woodcock home ranges were typically ≤ 1. 5 km from streams, agricultural openings, upland young forests, and moist soils. Across Rhode Island, most forested land was in the low – moderate classes of relative probability of use, but young forest management in key areas effectively increased relative use. I illustrated how land managers can use resource selection functions to predict the response of American woodcock to young forest management and so maximize conservation benefits. All of the American woodcock I monitored commuted between dense forest stands and forest openings during the day and night, respectively. I found no support for the foraging-benefit hypothesis because individuals moved from daytime locations where earthworms were 3 – 4 times more abundant to nighttime locations where preferred food was scarce. Soil moisture content was greater at daytime than nighttime locations which may explain why earthworms were more prevalent at those sites. In contrast, I found support for the predation-risk hypothesis because individuals moved from daytime locations where mammalian predators were more active to nighttime locations where mammalian predators were less active. Thus, American woodcock commuted between daytime and nighttime locations to avoid predators and not to feed. Maintaining forest openings {{is an important part of}} American woodcock habitat management so that individuals can eat by day and stay safe by night. I identified 38 – 51 bird species during 10 -minute point counts at American woodcock singing grounds and random forest sites, and 62 – 73 % of the more frequently occurring species were more common at American woodcock singing grounds. On average, 55 % of the more common species at American woodcock singing grounds were of high regional or local conservation priority. Young forest species such as <b>prairie</b> <b>warbler</b> (Setophaga discolor) and gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis) were more abundant at American woodcock singing grounds and scarce or absent at random forest sites while the opposite was true for more mature forest species such as ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) and red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus). Moreover, the total number of birds (all species combined) and diversity of birds were ≥ 1. 5 times greater at American woodcock singing grounds than random frest sites. Critical breeding sites for American woodcock can be managed by clearcutting ≥ 2 -ha patches of older secondary forest and many other young forest bird species of conservation priority inhabit these managed areas. Thus, the American woodcock can serve as an effective umbrella species for young forest birds in the Northeast, USA, but complementary umbrella species such as the ovenbird should be considered to aid in the conservation of more mature forest birds...|$|E
