The Irish Volunteers {{had been working}} on their own plan to acquire weapons, and the success at Larne {{heightened}} nationalist suspicions that the authorities were acquiescent towards unionist militants in Ulster. After the events in Larne, the nationalist Irish Volunteers, formed in late 1913, attracted many new members.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, {{deprived}} of morphine for some days, he borrowed a shotgun on {{the pretext of}} killing a snake and {{shot himself in the}} chest. The wound was not fatal, and Marais therefore <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> barrel in his mouth and pulled the trigger. He did so on the farm Pelindaba, belonging to his friend Gustav Preller. For those who are familiar with the dark moods of certain of Marais' poems, there is a black irony here; in Zulu, Pelindaba means 'the end of the business' – although the more common interpretation is 'Place of great gatherings'.|$|E

Later, having been joined by one of his men, together they bombed their way along the trench until contact was established with an adjoining unit.|$|E
