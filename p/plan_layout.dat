A moat and secondary wall were added to the defences on the W and SW.

2500|$|This form of walled town {{can take}} two forms, either a wall across the {{constricted}} neck of a looped bend in a river, or a walled {{town on a}} raised spur of land {{at the point where}} one river enters another river at an acute angle. Towns of both types tend to be commoner in the Czech Republic than in Austria, and Český Krumlov on the Ultava {{is a classic example of}} the first type. Leoben is another example but is a rectugular town with grid <b>plan</b> <b>layout</b> that has been placed across a bend in a river. Examples of promontory forts between two rivers occur at Drosendorf [...] on the Thaya, close to the Bohemian border has a typical promotory layout, suggesting that it is of Slavic origin.

2500|$|Sustainability was {{a driving}} {{factor in the}} design of the library {{including}} use of an energy-efficient lighting system, maximization of natural lighting, and use of recycled materials. 1100 Architect, in collaboration with Atelier Ten, an international team of environmental design consultants and building services engineers, designed the library’s energy-efficient lighting system. The open <b>plan</b> <b>layout</b> and large use of glass allow for ample natural daylight year-round and low-energy LED light illuminates communal spaces. Recycled materials are incorporated into the design including carpet made from re-purposed truck tires, floors made from reclaimed window frame wood, and furniture made from FSC-certified plywood and recycled steel. Design features include a seemingly [...] "floating" [...] origami-style ceiling made up of triangular panels hung at varying angles and a padded reading nook fitted into the library's terrazzo-finished steel and concrete staircase. The interior uses an easy-to-navigate layout with its three distinct spatial areas of entry area, first floor space, and mezzanine visually unified through the ceiling.|$|E
2500|$|Korneuburg has {{an almost}} ovoid layout [...] The large {{rectangular}} grid <b>plan</b> <b>layout</b> {{with a large}} square in the centre has been compared with Silesian town layouts and presumably represents a re-design of the internal layout {{at the start of}} the 14th century, within the older town defences. Typical of this Silesian layout is the Market Square with the ‘Ringplatz’, with an isolated ‘Rathhaus’ or Town Hall in the centre, which was surrounded by the market. Originally Klosterneuburg and Kornueburg were administered together as ‘Nivenburg’. Kornueberg had market rights by 1114 and was granted a charter in 1298 by Duke Albrecht I, which led to the formal separation of Kornueburg from Klosterneuburg. in 1298 by Duke AlbrechtI I. [...] Also by this charter the town was to have ‘landesfürstliche Festung’, implying that the Emperor rather than the citizens were responsible for the maintenance of the wall. The main information for the defences comes from the plan of the defences published by Merian about 1650. This shows a double wall, and beyond this a water-filled moat circling the town. [...] At various strategic points there were ravelins, which were moated. Three gates, the Kloster Tor, the Viener Tor and the Schiff Tor, each had a circular moated barbican in front of them, presumably with a drawbridge. The Schiff Tor, which survived into the late 19th century, would have been a Watergate, leading to the Danube, before the river moved its course. The other gates have disappeared, and the moat filled by a road that circles the inner town, The inner and outer wall are clearly discernable in modern property boundaries, as is a ravelin to the S of the site of the Schiff Tor. Some substantial lengths of wall survive in the NE of the circuit.|$|E
