5|$|Boston College won the {{ceremonial}} pre-game coin toss to determine first possession and elected {{to kick off}} to begin the game, ensuring that the Eagles would receive the ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech kick returner Dyrell Roberts fielded the ball at the Tech six-yard line and returned it to the Tech 33-yard line before the first <b>play</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> a four-yard pass from quarterback Tyrod Taylor to wide receiver Danny Coale. Despite that initial gain, the Hokies were unable to advance the ball further and punted after going three and out. Boston College's Rich Gunnell fair caught the kick at the Eagles' 16-yard line, where the Boston College offense ran its first <b>play</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Running back Montel Harris ran for a one-yard gain, but Boston College was unable to gain the needed ten yards for a first down, just as Virginia Tech had failed {{to do in the}} prior series. After going three and out, the Eagles punted back to Virginia Tech and the Hokies' offense returned to the field at the Tech 39-yard line with 11:30 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E

5|$|Wake Forest {{kicked off}} {{to begin the}} game, and Georgia Tech {{returned}} the kick to its own 24-yard line. On the first <b>play</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> Tech running back Tashard Choice attempted a rush, but was stopped for a loss of one yard. The play {{set the tone for}} the rest of the game, which would be a hard-fought, low-scoring defensive struggle. After the loss, Choice broke free on the second <b>play</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> for a 24-yard run and a first down. On the next two plays, the Georgia Tech offense used their passing attack as quarterback Reggie Ball completed two passes, driving the Yellowjackets into Wake Forest territory. Subsequent plays allowed Tech to penetrate the Wake Forest red zone, but there, the Demon Deacons' defense stiffened. Despite having a first down inside the Wake Forest 10-yard line, Georgia Tech did not cross the goal line. Denied a touchdown, Georgia Tech was forced to settle for a field goal attempt from kicker Travis Bell. Bell's kick was good, and with 9:59 remaining in the first quarter, Georgia Tech took a 30 lead.|$|E

5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Auburn {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. The Tigers started the first drive {{of the second half}} at their 22-yard line. Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown alternated carries as Auburn gained 17 yards in their first three plays. Jason Campbell completed a pass for a five-yard loss, then, on the fifth play of the drive, completed a 53-yard pass to Anthony Mix. The pass was the longest <b>play</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> and drove the Tigers inside the Virginia Tech red zone. Three plays later, Campbell connected with Devin Aromashodu on a five-yard pass for the game's first touchdown. With 10:39 remaining in the third quarter, Auburn had taken a 16–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{different}} receivers {{caught at}} least one pass, with Dexton Fields leading all receivers in the game with sevencatches for 101yards. Both totals were the highest marks recorded in the game by either team. Fields was also the recipient of a play that tied for the longest pass <b>play</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> a 37-yard toss from Reesing halfway through the third quarter. Cornerback and game MVP Aqib Talib came into the game as a receiver several times, but because his appearance in the game was such an unusual occurrence, the Virginia Tech defense was able {{to zero in on}} him and prevent him from catching the ball.|$|E

In their 19 games of the season, the Packers had a turnover ratio of plus 24, and outscored their opponents 100–48 in the playoffs.

The Eagles' offense {{dominated}} {{the first half of}} the game statistically, but failed to add to its early lead until the second quarter, when a field goal made it 100. Virginia Tech answered with a touchdown of their own, but Boston College responded with a seven-play, 74-yard touchdown drive of its own. Then came perhaps the most pivotal <b>play</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> During the extra point kick following the Boston College touchdown, Virginia Tech's Duane Brown blocked the kick, which was caught by the Hokies' cornerback Brandon Flowers, who returned it 75yards for a defensive two-point conversion.|$|E
