5|$|The US Navy trialled an {{automatic}} system made by General Electric of New York {{on the supply}} ship USS Hamul, but halted research in 1942. The US Navy sent its control system and diffused lighting fittings to Canada's NRC, which installed it on the corvettes HMCS Edmundston and HMCS Rimouski in 1943 and carried out further <b>prototyping.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} built in the Unity game engine, which enabled faster <b>prototyping</b> across {{multiple}} smartphone platforms. It was also designed first to fit on the iPhone's smaller screen—a lesson learned from Hitman Go, which had been designed for tablets. The Square Enix team collaborated with Tomb Raider brand owners Crystal Dynamics to fit the series license. The player-character outfits, in particular, were informed by this exchange.|$|E
5|$|A {{limited edition}} retail {{version of the}} PC game was {{released}} in April 2011. It included bonuses such as behind-the-scenes videos, a sample disc of the game's music, and a Super Meat Boy comic. In 2012 Team Meat began <b>prototyping</b> an iOS and Android version of the game. The game {{is intended to be}} a different take on the Super Meat Boy concept that is more adapted to touch-screen controls than a direct port would be. Later Team Meat released two images of the new game one with the new graphics and other with the new chapter named The Green Hills.|$|E

5|$|Silicon nitride {{has long}} been used in {{high-temperature}} applications. In particular, it was identified {{as one of the}} few monolithic ceramic materials capable of surviving the severe thermal shock and thermal gradients generated in hydrogen/oxygen rocket engines. To demonstrate this capability in a complex configuration, NASA scientists used advanced rapid <b>prototyping</b> technology to fabricate a one-inch-diameter, single-piece combustion chamber/nozzle (thruster) component. The thruster was hot-fire tested with hydrogen/oxygen propellant and survived five cycles including a 5-minute cycle to a 1320°C material temperature.|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} {{with a more}} experimental ethos until the company began {{to run out of}} capital. The Canadian government loan that had funded Polytron's <b>prototyping</b> phase was not renewed for their production phase. They also lost funding from the organization that preceded the Indie Fund as Polytron's producer left the company. Fish borrowed money from friends and family for three months to keep the company open. In dire straits, he considered canceling the project. In March 2011, the nearby Québécois developer-publisher Trapdoor offered to help Polytron, having just signed a deal with Electronic Arts to publish their own game, Warp. Trapdoor assisted with Polytron's finances and operations and offered to treat them as part of their company and let them keep their intellectual property rights in exchange for a portion of Fez earnings. Fish felt that partnership rescued the game.|$|E
5|$|Development of Space Race {{began in}} Summer 1972 {{under the name}} Asteroid by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, based on ideas by him and co-founder Ted Dabney. The final design was done by Dabney, {{possibly}} with assistance by Bushnell and Pong designer Allan Alcorn. The game was planned to be quick to create to fulfill an earlier contract with Bally Midway. The engineering and <b>prototyping</b> was done by Alcorn; after it was completed and the design given to Midway to be released as Asteroid, Atari produced its own nearly identical version as Space Race. Fifty Space Race cabinets were produced using a fiberglass design by George Faraco {{before the rest of}} the production was switched to a cheaper standard cabinet.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, {{planning}} began {{for a new}} {{theme park}} adjacent to Universal Studios Florida. By the end of 1993, {{it was decided that}} one area of the future Islands of Adventure theme park would be themed after Marvel Comics, with a Hulk theme being selected for a thrill ride. The designers of the ride wanted to simulate being fired out of a cannon and subsequently set about <b>prototyping</b> a launch system. Universal Creative and MTS Systems Corporation had a working prototype in January 1995. Methods to achieve this acceleration were investigated into mid-1996. On-site construction of Islands of Adventure was underway in 1997, with Superior Rigging & Erection being responsible for erecting the supports and track of the roller coaster. On May 28, 1999, Islands of Adventure officially opened to the public, with The Incredible Hulk being one of its debut attractions.|$|E
5|$|The {{engineering}} and <b>prototyping</b> for Asteroid {{was done by}} Alcorn. The game is encoded entirely in discrete electronic components, like Atari's earlier games, and unlike later computer-based arcade games; the graphics are all simple line elements {{with the exception of}} the spacecraft, which are generated based on diodes on the circuit board arranged in the shape of half of a ship to represent the shape they create. That half ship is mirrored on the screen, similar to the diode array in Computer Space, which generated eight directions of a rotating ship with a mirrored four images. The game was completed quickly, and Alcorn soon moved on to Atari's third game, Gotcha. When the game was complete, the design was given to Midway to sell under that name, only for Atari to produce a nearly identical version itself titled Space Race, which was released on July 16, 1973.|$|E

25|$|Functions as object constructors: Functions {{double as}} object constructors, {{along with their}} typical role. Prefixing a {{function}} call with new will create an instance of a <b>prototype,</b> inheriting properties and methods from the constructor (including properties from the Object <b>prototype).</b> ECMAScript 5 offers the Object.create method, allowing explicit creation of an instance without automatically inheriting from the Object <b>prototype</b> (older environments can assign the <b>prototype</b> to null). The constructor's <b>prototype</b> property determines the object used for the new object's internal <b>prototype.</b> New methods can be added by modifying the <b>prototype</b> of the function used as a constructor. JavaScript's built-in constructors, such as Array or Object, also have <b>prototypes</b> that can be modified. While {{it is possible to}} modify the Object <b>prototype,</b> it is generally considered bad practice because most objects in JavaScript will inherit methods and properties from the Object <b>prototype,</b> and they may not expect the <b>prototype</b> to be modified.|$|R

40|$|Both role incongruency theory (Eagly & Karau, 2002) and {{the lack}} of fit model by Heilman (1983) suggest that the underrepresentation of women in {{leadership}} positions {{can be explained by the}} male-typedness of leader <b>prototypes.</b> We examine how women and men project their gender <b>prototypes</b> onto leader <b>prototypes.</b> We found initially that men more so than women projected their gender <b>prototypes</b> on leader <b>prototypes.</b> For men there is more of an overlap between a prototypical men and a prototypical leader than there is an overlap between a prototypical woman and a prototypical leader. Women, however, do not engage in so called relative ingroup projection. In the current study, we further decompose this finding asking whether the gender difference in relative ingroup projection on leadership <b>prototypes</b> is driven by female <b>prototypes,</b> male <b>prototypes,</b> and/or leader <b>prototypes.</b> We further examine to what extent this gender difference is more manifested on positively valenced or negatively valenced attributes of <b>prototypes.</b> Our findings show that, while women and men have similar <b>prototypes</b> of leaders and men on both positively and negatively valenced attributes, men relative to women have less favorable <b>prototypes</b> of women but only on positively valenced attributes. An interesting implication is that efforts to address gender differences in the projection of gender <b>prototypes</b> onto leader <b>prototypes</b> should focus less on leader <b>prototypes</b> and more on the female <b>prototypes.</b> Theoretically, our findings allude to the importance of distinguishing between more subtle (evaluating the outgroup less positively on positive properties) and less subtle forms (evaluating the outgroup more negatively on negative properties) of outgroup derogation...|$|R
