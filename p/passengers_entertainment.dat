40|$|Vehicular ad hoc {{networks}} are studied with increasing {{interest for the}} many possible applications they have. Equipping vehicles with wireless devices primarily allows to design protocols and mechanisms to improve street safety. But also distributed applications for cooperative work, fleet management, <b>passengers</b> <b>entertainment,</b> could be supported. However, novel network protocols must be designed to make the deployment of vehicular networks possible. In this paper we consider the problem of data routing. We propose a novel position-based routing algorithm that is able to exploit both street topology information achieved from geographic information systems and information about spatial distribution of vehicles along street and vehicular traffic, in order to perform accurate routing decisions. The algorithm has been implemented in the NS- 2 simulation environment and its performance has been compared with three other algorithms proposed in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are {{no longer}} a futuristic promise but rather an {{attainable}} technology. Vehicles are already equipped with a variety of computational devices that control or assist drivers in many tasks such as localization, safely breaking, parking and <b>passengers</b> <b>entertainment.</b> The majority of services envisioned for VANETs either require the provision of multimedia support or have it as an extremely beneficial additional feature. In particular, video streaming capabilities over VANETs are crucial to the development of interesting and valuable services. However,VANETs’ highly dynamic topology poses as a demanding challenge to the fulfillment of video streaming’s stringent requirements. The main goal on this thesis is the development of feasible solutions that support the streaming of video content over VANETs. Initially, the main issues of VANETs are explained through both a discussion of its characteristics and the results of some preliminary conclusions. Based on this understanding of VANETs’ peculiarities, three distinguishing solutions are designed REACT-DIS, REDEC and VIRTUS; the two first for video dissemination and the later for video unicast. These solutions offer a great advancement towards the provision of video streaming capabilities but packet loss is still an issue at high data rates. In order to improve the delivery ratios reached by the previous solutions, redundancy is used as an error correction mechanism. The use of redundancy is ideal for VANETs in handling packet loss as they do not require any interaction between source and receivers nodes. Sophisticated coding techniques were used for an efficient use of the increase on entropy of the information sent by the source node. It was also evaluated the selective use of redundancy solely on packets carrying the crucial information of I-frames. Although this selective approach obtained lower overall delivery ratios than when redundancy is used for all packets, the video quality obtained similar improvements under a much lower cost. The evaluation on the use of redundancy has considered the impact on the rate by which unique video content is received at end-users which is fundamental to understand the resolution of videos that can be displayed. This thesis provides several contributions as it advances the knowledge in the peculiarities of VANETs, solutions for video streaming over VANETs and the use of redundancy as an error correction mechanism for video streaming over VANETs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Cognitive radio (CR) {{vehicular}} {{networks are}} poised to opportunistically use the licensed spectrum for high bandwidth inter-vehicular messaging, driver-assist functions, and <b>passenger</b> <b>entertainment</b> services. Recent rulings that mandate the use of spectrum databases introduce additional challenges in this highly mobile environment, where the CR enabled vehicles must update their spectrum data frequently and complete the data transfers with roadside base stations. As the rules allow local spectrum sensing only under the assurance of high accuracy, there is an associated tradeoff in obtaining assuredly correct spectrum updates from the database at a finite cost, compared to locally obtained sensing results that may have a finite error probability. This paper aims {{to answer the question}} of when to undertake local spectrum sensing and when to rely on database updates through a novel method of exploiting the correlation between 2 G spectrum bands and TV whitespace.

40|$|Current {{aircraft}} cabin systems utilize a wired network topology and offer only limited <b>passenger</b> <b>entertainment</b> services. In {{this article we}} explore the feasibility of utilizing a wireless network to reduce cabin wiring and reconfiguration costs and to provide passengers with a high-quality entertainment experience, including person-alized video and audio as well as state-of-the-art computer games. The problem is to determine whether this is feasible given the computer system demands of state-of-the-art network-based games, combined with the design constraints imposed by the {{aircraft cabin}} environment and the bandwidth demands of streaming video. These constraints have both hardware and network design factors. In both cases, the study assumes functionality that would be commercially available in the 2008 timeframe and beyond. We develop several architectures, and {{through a combination of}} emulation and simulation, assess the viability of each alternative.

40|$|Embedded {{control systems}} consist of {{multiple}} components with different criticality levels interacting with each other. For example, in a passenger jet, {{the navigation system}} interacts with the <b>passenger</b> <b>entertainment</b> system in providing passengers the distance-to-destination information. It is imperative that failures in the non-critical subsystem should not compromise critical functionality. This architectural principle for robustness can, however, be easily compromised by implementation-level errors. We describe Safe-Flow, which statically analyzes core components in the system {{to ensure that they}} use non-core values communicated through shared memory only if they are run-time monitored for safety or recoverability. Using simple, local annotations and semantic restrictions on shared memory usage in the core component, SafeFlow precisely identifies accesses to unmonitored non-core values. With a few false positives, it identifies erroneous dependencies of critical data on noncore values that can arise due to programming errors, inadvertent accesses, or wrong assumptions regarding the absence of difficult-to-detect implementation errors such as data races and synchronization. We demonstrate the utility of SafeFlow by applying it to discover critical value flow dependencies in three prototype systems...|$|R

Recent rulings that mandate the use of spectrum databases have introduced additional challenges in this highly mobile environment, where the CR-enabled vehicles must update their spectrum data frequently and complete the data transfers with roadside base stations (BSs) in very short interac-tion times. This paper aims to answer two fundamental questions: 1) when to undertake local spectrum sensing, as opposed to access-ing spectrum database information at a finite cost overhead; and 2) how to ensure correct packet receptions among the multiple BSs and CR vehicles using fewer slots than the messages {{that need to be}} transmitted. The contributions of this paper are twofold: First, we introduce a method of qualifying the correctness of spec-trum sensing results using out-of-band 2 G spectrum data using experimental results. Second, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first work on applying the concept of interference alignment (IA) in a practical network setting, leading to dramatic reduc-tion in message transmission times.

50|$|Edward Garrett {{was named}} {{chairman}} {{and president of}} ISC in 1964. Following a strategy that had proved successful at Loral, Garrett transformed ISC by closing deficit-ridden plants, seeking civilian markets as well as government research-and-development contracts, and acquiring {{a wide array of}} young growth-oriented companies, mainly in defense and commercial electronics and manufacturing. In 1966, Garrett brought in his son-in-law, Harvey Blau, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, as General Counsel to help navigate legal issues and close transactions. ISC purchased 20 companies in 1968 alone, ranking second in acquisitions nationwide that year, as investor appetite for corporate conglomerates reached its peak. That year ISC listed its stock on the American Stock Exchange, which was then home to many fast-growing companies. ISC's subsidiaries operated plants throughout the United States and Canada producing electronic devices, special purpose trucks, hardware tools, batteries, furniture, decorative glassware, plastic packaging, calculators and data processors, and sheet-metal building products, among others. ISC’s biggest contracts of the Garrett era exemplified the company's continued ability to leverage innovative technologies it had developed for military or government purposes and apply them to civilian use.

The proposed project is placed at the intersection of tourism and driving and aims to enhance the trip experience during driving through social interaction. This thesis explores how a mobile application that allows instant messaging between travellers sharing similar context can add to road trip experiences. To inform the design of such an application, the project adopted the principle of the user-centred design process. User needs were assessed by running an ideation workshop and a field trip. Findings of both studies have shown that tourists have different preferences and diverse attitudes towards contacting new people. Yet all participants stressed the value of social recommendations. Based on those results and a later expert review, three prototype versions of the system were created. A prototyping session with potential end users highlighted the most important features including the possibility to view user profiles, choose between text and audio input and receive up-to-date information.

40|$|The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) {{released}} a Request For Proposal (RFP) {{in the form}} of an undergraduate design competition for a 153 passenger jet transport with a range of 3, 000 nautical miles. The primary requirement for this aircraft was low cost, both in acquisition and operation, with a technology availability date of the year 2000. This report presents the Non-Solo Design Group's response to the RFP, the Aluminum Falcon (AF- 1). Non-Solo's approach to development was to take the best elements of seven individual preliminary designs, then combine and refine them. The resulting aircraft meets or exceeds all requirements of both the RFP and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Highlights include a revolutionary wing planform, known as an M-wing, which offers many advantages over a conventional aft swept wing. For example, the M-wing lessens the travel in the aircraft center of gravity caused by fuel being stored in the wing. It also reduces the amount of torque imposed on the center wing box because more of the lifting load acts near the fuselage joint, rather than behind it. In essence, the M-wing offers the best of both worlds: using a forward swept wing root places the aerodynamic center of the wing further forward and allows the landing gear to be placed without the use of a yahudi. At the same time, with the outboard section swept backward the tip retains an amount of aeroelastic dampening that is lost on a completely forward swept wing. The result is a wing which has many advantages of a straight, unswept wings without the severe compressibility effects at high Mach numbers. Other highlights include judicious use of composites, giving recognition to the importance of weight and its effect on aircraft cost and performance, and an advanced <b>passenger</b> <b>entertainment</b> system which can be used as a source of revenue for the airlines. This aircraft meets the low-cost doctrine with an acquisition cost of $ 29 million and a direct operating cost of 3. 5 cents per seat mile. The AF- 1 incorporates new ideas with existing technology to result in an aircraft that will retain market viability well into the next century...|$|R

This paper illustrates the cause-to-effect chain link starting from the modernization of the aeronautical communication systems and leading to the network security concern in the civil aviation. The general threats to air-ground communication are depicted and then categorized.

The security mechanisms and protocols proposed for this purpose are discussed. Open research issues and challenges that have to be addressed in the security of current and future aeronautical data communication networks are presented in detail. The paper concludes with some improvement directions which can help to address those security issues. This survey can be used as a reference guide to first understand the factors that urge both the research community and the aviation industry to be concerned about network security in future aeronautical data communications.

40|$|The {{experience}} of comfort {{is an important}} factor in passengers’ acceptance of transport systems. Comfortable cabin environments can be used as a means to differentiate between aircraft manufacturers and airlines and therefore, may be a key marketing feature. In 2010 and 2011, the European Commission presented its vision for aviation in the year 2050, highlighting the importance of enhancing passengers’ experiences. They also envisaged the use of virtual reality (VR) to provide aircraft <b>passengers</b> with <b>entertainment</b> and a means of ‘escaping from the fast pace of society’. The VR-HYPERSPACE project addressed this vision by examining the use of virtual and mixed reality technologies to enhance passenger comfort on aircraft in the year 2050. This approach to increasing comfort would be comparatively cheaper than changing the physical parameters of an aircraft. This thesis presents a series of studies which investigated the ways in which two virtual environments (VEs) that were developed for the VR-HYPERSPACE project (one depicting a tropical island and one depicting the view outside of a low-flying aircraft, referred to as the ‘invisible aircraft VE’) could influence potential aircraft passengers’ comfort and experiences. The findings from these studies provide insight into the prospect of using VR to enhance passengers’ comfort and experiences in future flight from a user-centred perspective. An initial user study was carried out to gain an understanding of the ways in which the two VEs, with various combinations of motion tracking, affected people’s comfort and experiences. The results of this study showed that the VEs have the potential to enhance people’s experiences, for example, by giving them an enhanced perception of space and time. They also might provide people with unique opportunities if used in flight, for example to augment or escape the flight experience. The study identified that motion tracking enhanced the {{experience of}} the invisible aircraft VE but detracted from the relaxing nature of the tropical island VE. The findings of this study were used to select combinations of VEs and motion tracking configurations to be taken forward for further investigation. The initial study also identified that it was difficult to determine the extent to which VEs could enhance comfort when the participants were not exposed to discomfort. Consequently, a new approach to measuring the effect of interventions on discomfort was developed. This involved a workshop and a user study which were carried out to select and test sources of discomfort. Two common sources of discomfort were selected: the sound of a crying baby and restricted legroom. These were used subsequently to induce discomfort in participants in later studies. The final series of studies aimed to determine the extent to which VEs could distract people from sources of discomfort. The findings indicated that passive VEs could be used to either fully distract people from sources of discomfort or minimise their negative responses. However, the VE used was more effective at distracting people from the discomfort associated with restricted legroom than the sound of a crying baby. The findings indicated that VEs become more distracting when they are interesting and that when exposed to stressful stimuli, relaxing distractors may be beneficial. The findings also indicated that VEs can be used to support existing strategies which people might use to overcome sources of discomfort in present-day flight situations. This research considered existing research in both the comfort and the pain domains to develop a novel approach to enhancing passenger comfort through the use of VEs. The research showed that VEs have the potential to distract people from sources of discomfort which are commonly experienced in-flight and to enhance potential passengers’ flight experiences. Further investigation is required to understand whether VEs remain effective distractors over longer periods of time, when subject to multiple sources of discomfort and in real-world contexts...|$|R
