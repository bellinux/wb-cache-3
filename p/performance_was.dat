We also find that the proportion of independent directors on board is significantly positively associated with firm performance only when the firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> adjusted for the effect of earnings management. Similar results are found in ownership concentration too. These results suggest that independent directors are shown as more effective governance mechanism in Chinese listed firms when true firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> considered while the positive effect of CEO compensation disappears concerning true firm performance...|$|R
