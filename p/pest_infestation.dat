5|$|The egg {{parasite}} Trichogramma {{is frequently}} released inundatively to control harmful moths. Similarly, Bacillus thuringiensis and other microbial insecticides {{are used in}} large enough quantities for a rapid effect. Recommended release rates for Trichogramma in vegetable or field crops range from 5,000 to 200,000 per acre (1 to 50 per square metre) per week according {{to the level of}} <b>pest</b> <b>infestation.</b> Similarly, nematodes that kill insects (that are entomopathogenic) are released at rates of millions and even billions per acre for control of certain soil-dwelling insect pests.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea is {{the most}} common and {{destructive}} pest of soybean growth in Virginia. About one-third of Virginia acreage is treated annually with pounds of insecticide, costing farmers around 2 million dollars. The degree of damage varies {{on the size of the}} <b>pest</b> <b>infestation,</b> the timing, and the stage of the plant. However, soybean plants are capable of withstanding a large amount of damage without substantial yield loss depending on soil moisture, planting date, and weather. If the damage is early in the plants life, then damage will mostly be to the leaves. Plants compensate for the damage by processes such as increasing seed size in remaining pods. Most damage happens in August, when the plants are flowering. Attacks that happen after August do much less damage because many pods have developed tougher walls that H. zea can't penetrate. Infestations that affect pod formation and seed filling have the potential to reduce yields, and because this happens in the later stages of plants, they have less time to compensate.|$|E
25|$|Once {{deadwood}} {{has been}} shaped to the designer's plan, the exposed area is treated with a bleaching preservative. The most common is a horticultural combination of lime and sulfur, available from many garden outlets. The preservative protects the wood from rot and <b>pest</b> <b>infestation,</b> and provides a uniform bleaching that resembles weathered, aged wood. If the lime-sulfur mixture used, it is usually colored {{with a small amount}} of dark paint to make it look more natural. Without paint pigments, the lime-sulfur solution bleaches wood to a bone-white color that takes time to weather and become natural-looking.|$|E

25|$|Deadwood {{techniques}} {{are used for}} reasons both practical and aesthetic. Practically, collected specimens of aged trees often have dead wood present. Dead wood can also appear on a bonsai under cultivation for many reasons, including branch die-back, <b>pest</b> <b>infestation,</b> or disease. It can be partially or completely removed by the bonsai artist, but doing so may damage the tree's overall shape or the illusion of age. If dead wood is retained, however, it must be chemically treated to preserve it and to produce the coloration of weathered wood. In addition, the dead wood usually needs to be shaped to fit the aesthetic plan for the bonsai.|$|E
25|$|The {{regional}} council, {{responsible for}} managing natural and physical resources, provides flood protection and monitors environmental {{problems such as}} <b>pest</b> <b>infestation</b> and pollution. Invasive plant pests such as African feathergrass, goats rue and nodding thistle {{pose a threat to}} pastureland in this heavily agricultural-dependent region, and the council has instituted control campaigns. The council has also instituted animal pest control programmes. Possums are perceived as the major animal pest since they damage native forests and endanger cattle production through the spread of bovine tuberculosis. Eradication programmes also concentrate on rabbits, rooks and feral goats, while other exotic species such as Parma wallaby (Macropus parma), wasps, ferrets, stoats and weasels are a source of concern.|$|E
25|$|The IoT {{contributes}} significantly towards innovating farming methods. Farming challenges {{caused by}} {{population growth and}} climate change have made {{it one of the}} first industries to utilize the IoT. The integration of wireless sensors with agricultural mobile apps and cloud platforms helps in collecting vital information pertaining to the environmental conditions – temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, <b>pest</b> <b>infestation,</b> soil humus content or nutrients, besides others – linked with a farmland, can be used to improve and automate farming techniques, take informed decisions to improve quality and quantity, and minimize risks and wastes. The app-based field or crop monitoring also lowers the hassles of managing crops at multiple locations. For example, farmers can now detect which areas have been fertilised (or mistakenly missed), if the land is too dry and predict future yields.|$|E

2500|$|The {{approach}} to preventing <b>pest</b> <b>infestation</b> has changed {{quite a bit}} in the methodology employed. [...] Where formerly fumigants and pesticides were applied directly to every collection, now more passive and less toxic means of pest management are favored. [...] These newer techniques, termed integrated pest management (IPM), can be just as effective with careful and thorough planning. [...] Different object materials are sensitive to different infestations, so a thorough material understanding of the artifacts to be protected and the pests resident to the area is required. [...] Risks involving the collection building, constructive and decorative materials, and staff activities should be assessed, and a program should then be put in place which reduces these risks.|$|E
