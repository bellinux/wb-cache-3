That is, the input torus of the fluid coupling ran at a lower speed than the engine, due to {{the reduction of the}} forward gear assembly. This produced an exceptionally smooth startup because of the relatively large amount of slippage initially produced in the fluid coupling.

To achieve this goal, it is planned to apply the concept of high-contact-ratio (HCR) gearing to an independent final-drive <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>assembly</b> of the tracked vehicle transmission. Before applying the concept to the final-drive, the performances of both normal-contact-ratio (NCR) and HCR conventional parallel shaft spur gearing systems are evaluated and compared. The results show that, for the same torque, HCR gears are subjected to lower loads and endure almost double the life of NCR gears. This reveals that an HCR gear can transmit more power for the same size. Furthermore, the power loss, vibration, and noise level of the HCR gearing are significantly {{lower than those of}} the NCR gearing. The proven results of the case study have encouraged the replacement of the existing NCR gearing with the HCR gearing for the final-drive planetary assembly of the combat tracked vehicle for evaluation...|$|E

For example, <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> trains can be designed for following functions: gear reducers for power machinery, internal gear hubs for bicycle, gear increasers for wind generator, gear reducers for robot. In general, the reduction of non-coupled <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> train is less than 10.

This parametric excitation opens up bands of unstable regions of frequency, rather than just isolated resonances. Despite its many advantages, planetary gears, by virtue of having more components, and therefore more degrees of freedom, add to the complexity in terms of vibrational response. ^ This research is aimed at carrying out a numerical investigation on the effects of mesh stiffness. To establish this objective, a discretized model of a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>assembly</b> is set up using a lumped parameter approach. Subsequently, its natural frequencies are determined, and categorized based on the structured properties of modal response. A numerical algorithm using the Floquet theory is developed to trace the stability boundaries of a reduced order model. The boundaries for a Rayleigh-damped system are also traced, and compared with the instabilities of the undamped system. ^ Qualitative dependence of the external gear mesh stiffness on tooth profile modification is discussed, and stability boundaries are re-computed for different kinds of modifications. Forced response plots for ‘relieved’ profiles show that while the peak amplitudes of super-harmonic resonances decrease dramatically, amplitudes for primary resonances increase, owing to an increased strength of the fundamental frequency component in a modified stiffness profile. ...|$|E
