5000|$|The current building, {{which has}} been in use since 1914, {{originally}} boasted a recreational floor, a floor largely devoted to study, and a <b>party</b> <b>floor.</b> The first floor hosted a gymnasium ( [...] which is now closed but used for storage), a cantina for card, chess, and domino games, a billiard room with five tables ( [...] which is now the Covadonga Room. It has its own bar and is a rental option), and a three lane bowling alley that has been converted into a storage area. The second floor holds offices for the club administrators, an extensive library, several reading and educational rooms, a smoking room which is also used during the day for dominoes and card games, ladies parlor and dressing lounge and the auditorium and stage. The third floor houses the balcony of the theatre and a large ballroom.

Many of the current club members met their spouses at a dance at the Centro. The ballroom also houses private parties such as birthdays, wedding receptions, anniversaries, and many other celebrations. When the building was opened in 1914, the Tampa Daily Times ran an article on the architecture and features of the new club headquarters: “It is a monument to the memory of those who have devoted their best endeavors to the welfare of the institution, and a palace to those who stand faithful to its noble ideals” (May 16, 1914).|$|E
