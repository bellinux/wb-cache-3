She was admitted for a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, and severe intra- and extrahepatic bile duct dilatation with inner air density was noted. No papilla of Vater was present in the descending duodenum, and 2 small holes {{were present in the}} <b>pyloric</b> <b>ring.</b> Bile excretion from one of the small holes was observed under forward-viewing endoscope. It was considered that the pancreatic and bile ducts separately opened into the <b>pyloric</b> <b>ring.</b> Based on these findings, malformation of the pancreaticobiliary duct was diagnosed. She did not wish treatment, but the obstruction associated with duodenal stenosis was noted after 2 years. Pancreatoduodenectomy was performed as curative treatment for duodenal stenosis and retrograde biliary infection through the bile duct opening in the <b>pyloric</b> <b>ring.</b> The ventral pancreas encompassed almost the entire circumference of the <b>pyloric</b> <b>ring,</b> suggesting a subtype of annular pancreas. Generally, lesions are present in the descending part of the duodenum in an annular pancreas, and the pancreatic and bile ducts join in the papillary region.

40|$|ReviewThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] original publication {{is available at}} [URL] anatomy of the pyloric sphincteric cylinder is discussed. The <b>pyloric</b> <b>ring</b> is not a separate anatomical structure, but is an inherent part of the cylinder. Contraction of the cylinder narrows {{the diameter of the}} <b>pyloric</b> <b>ring,</b> and thus of the pyloric aperture. The extent of the sphincteric cylinder is determined on radiographs. It is seen to be 3 - 5 cm in length when fully contracted. Anatomical features of the pyloric mucosal zone are reviewed. On the aboral side both the cylinder and the mucosal zone end at the ring. The entire cylinder is lined by pyloric mucosa, but the mucosal zone extends orally beyond the confines of the cylinder. In gastric ulcer it may extend much further up the stomach. In contrast to the cylinder, the greatest length of the mucosal zone is on the lesser curvature. The sphincteric cylinder and the pyloric mucosal zone are clearly defined anatomically. The term 'pyloric antrum', in contrast, has been used in many different senses. Publisher’s versio...|$|E

Ainda, devido a complexidade deste segmento, tambÃm serÃ analisada sua morfologia geral. Para tanto, lagartas hÃbridas de B. mori no 5 Â instar foram inoculadas experimentalmente com uma suspensÃo viral de BmMNPV. Em diferentes dias pÃs-inoculaÃÃo (dpi), do 2 Â ao 9 Â dpi, segmentos do intestino, contendo o piloro, com suas subdivisÃes (anel intersticial posterior, cone pilÃrico e vÃlvula pilÃrica), foram dissecados, seguindo o processamento histolÃgico de rotina para emblocamento em parafina e coloraÃÃes em hematoxina e eosina, na anÃlise da morfologia geral, e em Azan modificado, para a citopatologia. Segmentos tambÃm foram processados em microscopia eletrÃnica de varredura para anÃlise de detalhes morfolÃgicos. Assim, a morfologia geral do piloro das lagartas da B. mori foi semelhante Ã observada em outros insetos. A citopatologia mostrou que a Ãrea anterior do anel intersticial posterior Ã alvo secundÃrio de infecÃÃo pelo BmMNPV, a partir do 5 Â dpi, e seu ciclo infeccioso Ã semelhante ao descrito em literatura. No nÃcleo hipertrÃfico houve a formaÃÃo do viroplasma, local de produÃÃo dos nucleocapsÃdeos envelopados ou virions, seguindo a formaÃÃo e o desenvolvimento dos poliedros. Posteriormente, ocorreu a citÃlise, promovendo a liberaÃÃo dos poliedros e disseminaÃÃo da doenÃa, principalmente nos barracÃes de criaÃÃo de B. mori. A Ãrea posterior do anel intersticial posterior, o cone pilÃrico e a vÃlvula pilÃrica nÃo revelaram quaisquer indÃcios de infecÃÃo pelo BmMNPV e, desta forma, mecanismos de resistÃncia envolvendo fatores genÃticos poderiam estar atuando.

This virus is poliorganotrophic {{and a series}} of tissues are known as targets; however, literature does not present information in regards to the pylorus, segment of the hindgut, present in the transition with the midgut and responsible for regulating the passage of food towards the ileum. The organ is, thus, of fundamental importance in the ending of the digestive process, affecting the insectâs metabolic balance and, the present study sought to analyze its susceptibility and cytopathology in regards to BmMNPV, geographic isolate of ParanÃ, Brazil. Moreover, due to the complexity of this segment, its general morphology will also be analyzed. In order to do so, hybrid B. mori caterpillars at 5 Â instar were inoculated experimentally with a viral suspension of BmMNPV. On different day post-inoculation (dpi), from 2 Â to 9 Âdpi, segments of the intestine, containing the pylorus, with its subdivisions (posterior interstitial <b>ring,</b> <b>pyloric</b> cone and pyloric valve), were dissected, following the routine histological processing for paraffin wax blockage and dyes in haematoxylin and eosin, for general morphology analysis, and in modified Azan staining, for cytopathology. Segments also processed to form scanning electronic microscope for analized of morphological details. So the pylorus general morphology the caterpillars of B. mori, was similar to that observed in other insects. The cytopathology showed that the anterior area of the posterior interstitial ring is a secondary target of infection for the BmMNPV, after 5 Â dpi, and its infectious cycle is similar to that described in literature. In the hypertrophic nucleus one there the formation of viroplasm, place for production of enveloped nucleocapsids or virions, following the formation and development of the polyhedra. Later on, cytolysis occurred, promoting the liberation of polyhedra and the spreading of the disease, mainly in the B. mori creation sheds. The posterior area of the posterior interstitial <b>ring,</b> the <b>pyloric</b> cone and the pyloric valve did not reveal any traces of infection by BmMNPV and, thus, resistance mechanisms involving genetic factors could be acting.

40|$|Diagnosis of gastric subepithelial tumor (SET) {{has shown}} a rapid {{increase}} worldwide. Although, until now, endoscopic ultrasound guided procedures such as fine needle aspiration have shown relatively high accuracy in diagnosis of SET, the most important modality for {{diagnosis and treatment of}} SETs is complete resection such as endoscopic or surgical resection. However, endoscopic resection or laparoscopic wedge resection alone also has some limitations. Endoscopic resection is difficult to perform in cases of gastric SET located within deep portion of the gastric layer or a relatively large (larger than 25 mm diameter). On the other hand, gastric SET in a difficult location, such as the gastroesophageal junction or <b>pyloric</b> <b>ring</b> is challenging for laparoscopic surgical resection. The hybrid natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) technique is a combined method, including the advantages of both laparoscopic resection and endoscopic resection for gastric SETs.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of early gastric cancer (EGC) with duodenal invasion is extremely low, although advanced gastric cancer that arises in the antrum occasionally invades the duodenum. We investigated the clinicopathological features of EGC with duodenal invasion and provided strategies for clinical management.

Additional articles {{were obtained from}} references within the papers identified by the Medline search. We revealed that EGC with duodenal invasion was of the superficial spreading type of tumor.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Neuroendocrine cell (NEC) {{carcinoma}} is occasionally {{accompanied by}} adenocarcinoma {{but the relationship}} between these two morphologically distinct tumours is unclear. Two hypotheses have arisen regarding the mechanism for the association of adenocarcinoma and NEC carcinoma. One is that both are derived from a common multipotential epithelial stem cell. The second hypothesis is that adenocarcinoma and NEC carcinoma arise from a multipotential epithelial stem cell and a primitive NEC, respectively.  AIMS—To elucidate {{the relationship between the two}} histologically distinct tumours, adenocarcinoma of the stomach and NEC carcinoma of the duodenum.  PATIENT/METHODS—We present a case in which the tumour extended across the <b>pyloric</b> <b>ring,</b> the gastric portion of which revealed adenocarcinoma while the duodenal portion showed argyrophil NEC carcinoma. The two histologically distinct lesions of the tumour were examined by immunohistochemistry and genetic analysis of p 53.  RESULTS—The gastric region was negative for chromogranin A staining but positive for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) staining. In contrast, the duodenal region was positive for chromogranin A but negative for CEA. All tumour regions showed a point mutation in p 53 gene at exon 7  (GGC (glycine) →GTC (valine) at codon 245). The distal portion of the duodenal tumour showed an additional point mutation in p 53 gene at exon 5  (GCC (alanine) →GTC (valine) at codon 129).  CONCLUSIONS—The two histologically distinct tumours, adenocarcinoma of the stomach and NEC carcinoma of the duodenum, appear to be derived from a common epithelial cell.    Keywords: neuroendocrine cell carcinomas; adenocarcinoma; composite tumour; collision tumour...|$|E

In addition, histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen from the pylorus indicating a group V made differentiation from advanced gastric carcinoma extremely difficult. 急性胃粘膜病変（AGML）は粘膜炎といった表層性所見のほかに, 筋層炎または胃壁全層の炎症ため, 胃X線検査や内視鏡検査により進行胃癌との鑑別に難渋することがある. 今回, 早期胃癌にAGMLが併存したため, 進行胃癌との鑑別が困難であった 1 例を経験したので報告する. 症例は 82 歳の男性. 老人検診で胃X線検査および内視鏡検査を施行され, 胃癌の診断で当科に入院となった. 胃X線検査では, 立位充満像で幽門部大弯および小弯側に陰影欠損が認められ, 幽門部全体は硬直し, 幽門狭窄の状態であった. 胃内視鏡検査では, 幽門前庭部は強く屈曲し狭窄しており, 幽門粘膜は浮腫状で硬く, 前壁側に広く浅い潰瘍が広がっており, 所々に出血斑が認められた. 幽門前庭部からの生検でgroup V が得られた. 以上の所見より, 幽門狭窄を伴った Borrmann 3 型進行胃癌の診断で当科に入院となった. 入院後, 初回の内視鏡検査から 3 週目に施行された胃内視鏡検査では, 幽門粘膜に軽度の硬さが残存しており, やや壁の伸展不良が認められたものの, 浮腫状変化は著明に改善しており, 所々に浅い潰瘍やびらんが散在しているのみであった. 幽門前庭部前壁のらんから, 印環細胞癌の診断が得られた. 以上の成績より, AGML に併存した早期胃癌と診断し, 広範胃切除術, D_ 1 リンパ節郭清を施行した. 本症例は, 早期胃癌に AGML が併存したため, 幽門狭窄を伴った Borrmann 3 型進行癌との鑑別が困難な 1 例であった...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Laparoscopy {{assisted}} distal gastrectomy (LADG) {{has been}} accepted as the best standard operative technique in early gastric cancer. But, no predictive indicators of reconstructive procedure were reported. Analyzing the reconstructive procedure after LADG according to location of the lesion, we, herein, suggest an alternative. Methods: From May 2008 to May 2009, 55 patients with distal gastric cancer who underwent LADG were examined retrospectively. The group of 55 patients were assigned to two groups according to the reconstructive procedure undertaken: 41, Billroth I (BI); 14, Billroth II (BII). After measuring the distance between eso-phagogastric junction and tumor (ET) and between <b>pyloric</b> <b>ring</b> and tumor (PT), we found ET/(ET＋PT). Results: The mean±standard error time of ET in BI and BII group was 20. 5 ± 7. 9 cm (5 ∼ 38) and 13. 9 ± 6. 7 cm (6 ∼ 30). The mean±standard error time of PT in BI and BII group was 15. 1 ± 8. 2 cm (2 ∼ 36) and 22. 6 ± 9. 1 cm (8 ∼ 40). The mean±standard error time of ET/(ET＋PT) in BI and BII group was 57. 0 ± 21. 1 % (16. 1 ∼ 95. 0) and 39. 1 ± 19. 0 % (13. 0 ∼ 75. 0). ET, PT and ET/(ET＋PT) were correlated with reconstructive procedure (P= 0. 007, 0. 006, 0. 005). In comparative analysis of correlation between ET and reconstructive procedure, 95 % confidence level in BI and BII group is 18. 0 ∼ 22. 9 cm and 10. 0 ∼ 17. 7 cm; between PT and reconstructive procedure, 12. 5 ∼ 17. 7 cm and 17. 4 ∼ 27. 8 cm; and between ET/(ET＋PT) and reconstructive procedure, 51. 1 ∼ 64. 4 % and 28. 1 ∼ 50. 0 %...|$|E
30|$|Local {{resection}} is {{the standard}} treatment for GISTs [8 – 12]; original or classical LECS {{is considered to be}} a safe and useful procedure because it not only enables dissection of a tumor with minimal extra gastric wall tissue but is also suitable for all tumor locations, including proximity to the esophagogastric junction or <b>pyloric</b> <b>ring</b> [13]. Recently, many modified LECS procedures have been devised to prevent gastric contents, including tumor cells and bacteria, from being spilt into the abdominal cavity. These include inverted LECS, a combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic approaches to neoplasia with a non-exposure technique (CLEAN-NET), and non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery (NEWS) [16 – 18]. However, original or classical LECS is currently considered to be the standard procedure for gastric SMTs without mucosal defects because the use of modified LECS procedures is limited by several factors, including tumor size, location, and technical difficulty. To our knowledge, some cases of laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer with associated CSI have been reported; however, we could find no reports of LECS for GIST with CSI. In published reports about CSI, some authors have described reversing the operator position during surgery to facilitate recognition of anatomical features better [2, 3]; however, do not consider this to be necessary [4 – 6]. We intended both to mainly dissect the structures with the operator’s left hand and to carefully approach the anatomy in terms of “medial” and “lateral” relations, rather than “left” and “right,” as Eisenberg have mentioned that the medial and lateral anatomical relations in patients with CSI are preserved [19]. Moreover, the operator could switch the adequate position to perform surgery more safely and easily because LECS with both endoscopic and laparoscopic points of view provides essential information to ensure safe and smooth procedure for surgeons. From these reasons, we had few technical difficulties with this procedure and completed local resection of our patient’s gastric SMT using the technique of LECS as usual.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{assess the}} results of {{endoscopic}} mucosal resection (EMR) of benign mucosal neoplasms located on the duodenal bulb using endoscope retroflexion. METHODS This study involved 14 patients with 16 mucosal neoplasms located on the duodenal bulb. The diameter of each neoplasm was less than 15 mm. After endoscope retroflexion within the duodenum for evaluation of the size, extent and depth of the tumor, EMR was a empted with endoscope retroflexion for removing the lesion in the duodenal bulb. The rate of endoscope retroflexion, the time required for endoscope retrofl exion, median operation time, curative resection rate, enbloc resection rate, complication, and median follow-up period were evaluated. RESULTS Sixteen lesions in 14 patents (median age of 56 years, 5 female, 9 male) were removed through EMR. The mean size of the lesions resected was 6. 9 mm (median size of 5. 5 mm, range of 3 - 15 mm). Post-EMR histologic examination revealed Brunner’s gland hyperplasia in 6, gastric mucosal metaplasia in 5, adenoma in 1, chronic inflammation in 3, and benign lymphocytic hyperplasia in 1. The curative resection rate was 100 % (16 / 16), and the enbloc resection rate was 94 % (15 / 16), with EMR. One of the lesions was piecemeal removed through EMR for its large size (15 mm) and for its involving the area from the duodenal bulb to the <b>pyloric</b> <b>ring.</b> The success rate of endoscope retrofl exion within the duodenum was 94 % (15 / 16). The time required for endoscope retroflexion was longer for the fi rst 10 lesions (median time of 2 min, range of 1 - 2. 5 min) than {{that for the last}} 5 lesions (median time of 1. 5 min, range of 1 - 2 min). The median follow-up period was 22 months (range of 4 - 48 months). During the follow-up, no residual, no pyloric or duodenal stenosis was found in any of the patients after EMR. There was no severe hemorrhage, or perforations occurring. CONCLUSION EMR of mucosal neoplasm located on the duodenal bulb through endoscope retrofl exion, which is a feasible and useful adjunctive procedure, appears to be a safe and effective technique...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-three {{consecutive}} {{patients with}} duodenal ulceration complicated by pyloric stenosis who {{came under the}} care of one surgeon were treated by highly selective vagotomy (HSV) combined with digital dilatation of the stenosis through a gastrotomy. No form of drainage procedure was used. Thus the antral "mill" and the pyloric sphineter were left intact. Since the stenosis is usually distal to the pylorus rather than truly pyloric such dilatation does not damage the <b>pyloric</b> <b>ring,</b> although it may on occasion lead to perforation of {{the first part of the}} duodenum. The subsequent progress of these patients was compared with that of a similar, consecutive series of 23 patients with pyloric stenosis who were treated by truncal vagotomy with a drainage procedure by other surgeons on the same surgical unit. Patients were followed up for between four months and five years. The clinical assessment was carried out in "blind" fashion at a special gastric follow-up clinic. No evidence of recurrent ulceration was found in either group of patients. Two patients from each group subsequently came to reoperation for the relief of gastric stasis. Twenty-two of the 23 patients (96 %) who had undergone HSV plus dilatation eventually achieved a good-to-excellent clinical result (Visick grades 1 + 2), wheras only 17 of the 23 patients (74 %) who had undergone truncal vagotomy with drainage achieved such a result. The main clinical difference between the two groups was that side effects such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain or discomfort were more common after vagotomy with drainage than after HSV. These results bear witness to the remarkable propulsive powers of the gastric antrum after HSV, which were evidently sufficient to overcome any tendency to re-stenosis in more than 90 % of patients. The 9 % incidence of failure due to re-stenosis could perhaps be avoided if a small duodenoplasty were performed instead of simple digital dilatation. The results support the hypothesis that damage to the antral mill and pyloric sphincter can be avoided in the course of operations for "pyloric" stenosis secondary to duodenal ulceration. Avoidance of the drainage procedure is of benefit to the patient, just as it is in patients who have duodenal ulceration without stenosis...|$|E
40|$|Cryptosporidium parvum is a coccidian {{protozoan}} that colonizes {{epithelial cells}} lining respiratory and digestive tracts {{of animals and}} humans. Cryptosporidiosis is a well-recognized zoonotic disease infecting primarily neonates and immunocompromised hosts, including human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Clinical disease is manifested as a chronic diarrheal illness that is self-limiting in immunocompetent hosts and prolonged and often life-threatening in hosts with compromised immune systems. The lack of a suitable small animal model for screening anti-cryptosporidial drugs and for examining the pathogenicity and immunobiology of chronic cryptosporidosis was the impetus for this research effort. The objectives {{of the present study}} were three-fold: to characterize chronic Cryptosporidium parvum infections in dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mice; evaluate the effects of Cryptosporidium parvum and dexamethasone on B and T lymphocyte proliferation; and determine the effects of the immunomodulator dehydroepiandrosterone on oocyst shedding intensities of mice infected with Cryptosporidium parvum Adult C 57 BL/ 6 N mice were immunosuppressed with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, then infected with Cryptosporidium parvum (106 oocysts/mouse) and investigated for their ability to sustain a four-month chronic infection. Dexamethasone was administered intraperitoneally (125 μ/mouse/day) or orally (8 μ/ml) in the drinking water ad libitum. Infection chronicity was characterized by evaluating mouse mortality, oocyst excretion in the feces, tissue distribution of the parasite, and the parasite-induced pathology. A progressive infection with Cryptosporidium parvum occurred in mice immunosuppressed intraperitoneally and orally as long as dexamethsone was administered. Mice receiving dexamethasone given intraperitoneally had a shorter prepatent period and a more consistent, although cyclic, oocyst shedding pattern when compared with mice given dexamethasone orally. Mice given dexamethasone orally exhibited a delayed prepatent period, with a steady increase in oocyst shedding. All mice receiving dexamethasone orally died within three months following oocyst inoculation. Clinical signs included dehydration, icterus, and reduction in spleen and body weights. Clinical signs were more abrupt in mice receiving oral dexamethasone. Parasite colonization involved the entire intestinal tract, including the <b>pyloric</b> <b>ring</b> and Peyer 2 ̆ 7 s patches, but was the heaviest in the terminal ileum. Parasites were present in the lungs, gallbladder, and pancreatic ducts. Pathologic abnormalities were isolated to the terminal small intestine and included blunting and fusion of intestinal villi and crypt hyperplasia. Cryptosporidium parvum and dexamethasone administered in vivo reduced B and T lymphocyte responses to the mitogens lipopolysaccharide and concanavalin A. Dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate resulted in no significant reductions in cryptosporidial activity as determined by oocyst shedding in the feces...|$|E
