40|$|AC {{losses in}} high {{temperature}} superconductors (HTS) {{are an important}} design parameter for large scale power applications. It is often necessary to have a metallic containment vessel to house the superconducting element in a closed loop cryogenic system.

In this work we propose and demonstrate new AC-biased Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) circuits, and search for synergy of AC and currently dominating DC biasing schemes. As the first step, we suggest an on-chip AC/DC converter capable of feeding a few DC-biased gates surrounded by their AC-biased counterparts. As the second step, we introduce and present the first successful demonstration of a new AC-powered circuit - an 8192 -bit shift register with over 32, 800 Josephson junctions (JJs) and JJ density of about 6 x$ 10 ^ 5 $ JJ per $cm^ 2 $. We suggest a few niche applications {{for this type of}} AC-biased circuits, not requiring high clock rates. E. g., these, scalable to millions of JJs per chip, circuits can serve as a convenient benchmark for new SFQ fabrication technology nodes, allowing the operating margins of individual cells to be extracted and, thus, 'visualize' individual fabrication defects and flux trapping events.

40|$|Abstract—Following the {{successful}} adoption of high tempera-ture superconductors (HTS) {{in over a}} thousand current leads that will feed 3 MA from warm to cold in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the use of HTS has been generally accepted as suitable tech-nology {{for the design of}} efficient leads feeding cryo-magnets. We now consider the extension of the technology to the interconnec-tion of strings of superconducting magnets and their connection to feed-boxes through which the excitation current is fed. It is pro-posed to use HTS material for this application instead of low-tem-perature superconductor or normal-conducting material. The im-plications of adopting this technology are discussed with regard to the choice of materials, highlighting the differences with more con-ventional schemes.

40|$|In Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) {{and other}} similar {{applications}} of superconducting microresonators, both the large and small-signal behaviour of the device may be affected by electrothermal feedback. Microwave power applied to read out the device is absorbed by and heats the superconductor quasiparticles, changing the superconductor conductivity and hence the readout power absorbed in a positive or negative feedback loop. In this work, we explore numerically the implications of an extensible theoretical model of a generic superconducting microresonator device for a typical KID, incorporating recent work on the <b>power</b> flow between <b>superconductor</b> quasiparticles and phonons. This model calculates the large-signal (changes in operating point) and small-signal behaviour of a device, allowing us {{to determine the effect}} of electrothermal feedback on device responsivity and noise characteristics under various operating conditions. We also investigate how thermally isolating the device from the bath, for example by designing the device on a membrane only connected to the bulk substrate by thin legs, affects device performance. We find that at a typical device operating point, positive electrothermal feedback reduces the effective thermal conductance from the superconductor quasiparticles to the bath, and so increases responsivity to signal (pair-breaking) power, increases noise from temperature fluctuations, and decreases the Noise Equivalent Power (NEP). Similarly, increasing the thermal isolation of the device while keeping the quasiparticle temperature constant decreases the NEP, but also decreases the device response bandwidth.

40|$|The Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) {{sponsored}} a Congressional briefing on high temperature superconductivity (HTS) technologies, which promise lower costs, less pollution, more capacity and other advantages in {{the transmission of}} an electric current. All of these advantages are crucial as electricity demand increases and the present infrastructure of wires, transformers and generating plants reaches dangerous levels of obsolescence. The burgeoning energy needs of the United States {{are not likely to}} be met by simply building more transmission lines and generating plants. According to the panel of speakers, HTS power applications, which are being tested in several U. S. locations, are expensive and must prove themselves in trials, but the future of the technology is very bright. Superconductors can carry unusually large amounts of electricity without resistance energy losses. Electric <b>power</b> equipment using <b>superconductors</b> typically have double the power capacity with only half the energy losses of the same-sized conventional counterparts. This would have a major impact in reducing the eight to ten percent of power generated that is now lost before reaching the consumer. In addition, HTS has a lower pollution potential because, among other reasons, no oil is needed for transformers and underground cables. High temperature superconductivity was initially discovered in 1986, and research and development by government and private industry has been devoted to HTS for more than 12 years. It is referred to as high temperature because the cooling necessary for HTS is at the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, which is minus 323 degrees Fahrenheit. For comparison, helium, which is used medically in magnetic resistant imaging (MRI), has a boiling point of minus 452 degrees. Because helium costs about $ 10 for a two-liter bottle compared to liquid nitrogen costing about 25 cents for the same size bottle, it is unrealistic to contemplate helium for "real world" generation and transmission of electricity...|$|R

However, HTS wires have constraints that limit the minimum radius of winding, and even if good wires can be produced, the technology for joining superconducting wires does not exist. In this paper, the design and capabilities of a rare earth zinc magnetostrictive actuator using bulk HTS is described. Bulk superconductors can be fabricated in the sizes required with excellent superconducting properties. Equivalent permanent magnets, made with this inexpensive material, are persistent, do not require a persistent switch as in HTS wires, and can be made very small. These devices are charged using a technique which is similar to the one used for charging permanent magnets, e. g., by driving them into saturation. A small normal conducting coil can be used for charging or discharging. Because of the magnetic field capability of the superconductor material, a very small amount of superconducting magnet material is needed to actuate the rare earth zinc. In this paper, several designs of actuators using YBCO and BSCCO 2212 superconducting materials are presented. Designs that include magnetic shielding to prevent interaction between adjacent actuators will also be described. Preliminary experimental results and comparison with theory for BSCCO 2212 with a magnetostrictive element will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} thermally induced bubble behaviour {{changes in}} liquid nitrogen (LN 2) under electric fields. Cryogenic liquids such as LN 2 {{have been used}} not only as the coolant but also as the electrical insulator in superconducting and cryogenic apparatus. However, bubbles are easily formed in these liquids by even moderate heating because of a narrow liquid temperature range and low boiling point. Bubbles {{are considered to be}} one of the factors causing a reduction of the electrical insulation level. Consequently, bubble behaviour in electric fields is of great interest primarily in the study of prebreakdown and breakdown phenomena in the presence of thermally induced bubbles. In addition, a bubble can appear and its behaviour changes in a fluid under the influence of an electric field, and this is the main reason for boiling heat transfer enhancement which is related to thermal stability and heat transfer efficiency. Studies including single bubble behaviour and bubble column behaviour as well as boiling heat transfer enhancement due to changes in bubble behaviour under electric fields using different electrodes have been completed. Free thermal bubble motion and related characteristics in LN 2 under a conductor-plane electrode have been experimentally studied. A model for bubble motion in this non-uniform electric field has been developed and is described. Compared with theoretical results, the experimental measurements are in good agreement. An rimental study into the behaviour of thermal bubbles between two plane-plane inclined electrodes has been completed. Using a stainless steel mesh-to-plane electrode system, experimental investigations have been carried out to study the effect of uniform dc electric fields on the behaviour of a single thermal bubble in LN 2. Bubble characteristics such as bubble growth, deformation and bubble departure frequency have been experimentally evaluated. Finally, the electric field effects on boiling heat transfer of LN 2 have been experimentally assessed. The obtained data is applicable to the design of LN 2 cooled high temperature <b>superconductor</b> <b>power</b> apparatus for both coolant and electrical insulation issues...|$|R
40|$|With the {{continuous}} {{decline in the}} price of second-generation (2 G) high temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes, the 2 G HTS cables are a promising candidate to significantly improve the electrical power transmission capacity and efficiency. In order to make the HTS cable competitive to its counterparts in the power market, much ongoing research work have made considerable contributions to the HTS cable design. In this thesis, the challenges of electrical issues of superconducting power cable using 2 G HTS tapes have been addressed. The specific contributions of the thesis include: the influence of anisotropic characteristics of 2 G HTS is investigated in order to increase critical current of HTS cable; For improvement of transmission efficiency and safety, the homogenization of HTS cable current distribution is achieved considering the influence of contact resistances and HTS layer inductances; AC loss of HTS cable is obtained through experimental measurement for cooling system design; and the impact of HTS cable on power grids is analysed for safe integration of HTS cable into grids. This thesis starts with a literature review of superconductivity and developments of 2 G HTS cable. Following the literature review is the critical current investigation of HTS cable considering the anisotropy of 2 G HTS tape. 2 G HTS tapes were placed in a highly uniform electromagnetic field and the in-field critical currents were measured with various magnitudes and orientations of the magnetic field. The anisotropic characteristics of 2 G HTS tape were determined by non-linear curve fitting using measured in-field critical currents and further implemented into the HTS cable finite element method (FEM) modelling. The modelling results indicate that the gap distances among the tapes in the HTS cable affect the critical current of the HTS cable due to the anisotropic characteristics. In order to investigate the critical current of HTS cable with respect to gap distances, an HTS cable circuit model with adjustable gap distances among the parallel placed HTS tapes was designed and built. Extensive experimental and FEM modelling were performed and the results indicate that the minimized gap distance among the neighboring HTS tapes can be beneficial to increase the overall cable critical current. With DC transporting current, the homogenization of current distribution of HTS cable is achieved by controlling the contact resistances. A 1. 5 m long prototype HTS cable consisted of two HTS layers was fabricated and tested as a further investigation of the HTS cable circuit model. The magnitude of the contact resistance related to each HTS layer was measured to quantitatively calculate the current distribution. It is found that only a few micro-ohms difference of contract resistances can still cause severe imbalanced current distribution. The FEM modelling work was carried out to obtain the balanced current distribution by varying the contact resistances. With AC transporting current, the inductances of HTS layers in the cable also pose a significant influence on current distribution issues. An optimal algorithm was developed to achieve homogeneous current distribution by optimal design of the cable diameter, pitch angle and winding direction. Another short prototype cable wound with two HTS layers was built according to the optimal design and the current distribution was experimentally measured between the two layers. It is found out that the optimal algorithm is effective to homogenize the AC current distribution. A reliable AC loss measurement was carried out on the 1. 5 m long prototype HTS cable in order to quantify the AC loss of the HTS cable for cooling system design. The experimental measurement method is based on the electrical four probe method adopting a compensation coil to cancel the large inductive component of the cable. The HTS cable with long geometry is easily influenced by the surrounding electromagnetic field so that the measured AC loss signal can be influenced. In order to overcome this problem, a symmetrical current return path was utilized in order to eliminate the electromagnetic interface surrounding the HTS cable. The AC loss measurement results are stable and low-noise for a set of AC frequencies, which proves the accuracy of the measurement technique. Finally, a new superconductor component in PSCAD/EMTDC (Power System Computer Aided Design/Electromagnetic Transients including DC) was developed in order to investigate the impact of the HTS cable integrated into the meshed <b>power</b> network. The <b>superconductor</b> component developed in PSCAS/EMTDC takes into account the heat exchange with the HTS cable cryogenic envelope and the detailed configuration of YBCO HTS tape so that HTS cable model is able to accurately predict the power flow, fault current level and grid losses of the power grid with HTS cables...|$|R
