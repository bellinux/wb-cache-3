5|$|Don Quixote in England {{was started}} as Fielding's second play, {{but it was}} not {{finished}} and produced until the later part of his career. After Fielding returned to London from the University of Leyden during the end of 1729, he brought with him a version of Don Quixote in England. It was refused by the Theatre Royal and it was not produced or printed until 1734. The only information on the origins of this play come from Fielding's 1734 preface. It was his second play, and Fielding attributes it to being written at Leyden during 1728. It was intended more as amusement than as a serious production and was an imitation of Cervantes's Don Quixote. After the prompting of Barton Booth and Colley Cibber, Fielding <b>put</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> play until 1733, when the Drury-Lane actors asked him for a new play. Soon after, Fielding rewrote parts of the play.|$|E

The next day saw the Chiefs beat the Highlanders before a startling {{mountain}} backdrop in Queenstown. The Crusaders annihilated the Force 53–0. It {{was the largest}} score ever conceded by the Force and the largest losing margin – but for the Crusaders it didn't come close to their 96–19 win against the Waratahs in 2002. The Sharks continued the high scoring – putting 57 points on the Reds in Brisbane for a big win. The Stormers upset the Lions 30–8 in Cape Town. In the sole Easter Sunday clash the Waratahs failed to resurrect their season against the Brumbies – going down 36–10 in the interstate grudge match between the rivals. The win put the Brumbies into the top four {{for the first time}} in 2007.|$|E

25|$|With the semi {{final week}} {{just around the}} corner, Week 13 saw some close matches {{including}} the opener between the Highlanders and the Hurricanes at the cake tin. The score was 22 – 16 to the Hurricanes at 80 minutes but a final minute try to Toby Morland in the corner turned things around. Nick Evans {{needed to get the}} kick over to win the game but was unsuccessful allowing the Hurricanes to win the game lucky to not have the same situation when the Hurricanes lost to the Force in week 6. The force continued their up and down season by comfortably beating the cheetahs. The Waratahs narrowly lost going down to the chiefs. The Brumbies pulled an upset win over the Crusaders to keep their semi final hopes alive. The Sharks dominated the lions to make sure they would at least get a home semi final. The Blues lost their third game in a row going down to the Bulls which slimmed the chances of the Blues securing a semi final spot and helped the Bulls secure a semi final spot. The last game of the week saw the stormers easily <b>put</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> Reds.|$|E

2500|$|Easter is {{the most}} {{important}} Christian feast, and the proper date of its celebration {{has been the subject of}} controversy as early as the meeting of Anicetus and Polycarp around 154. According to Eusebius' Church History, quoting Polycrates of Ephesus, churches in the Roman Province of Asia [...] "always observed the day when the people <b>put</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> leaven", namely Passover, the 14th of the lunar month of Nisan. The rest of the Christian world at that time, according to Eusebius, held to [...] "the view which still prevails," [...] of fixing Easter on Sunday. Eusebius does not say how the Sunday was decided. Other documents from the 3rd and 4th centuries reveal that the customary practice was for Christians to consult their Jewish neighbors to determine when the week of Passover would fall, and to set Easter on the Sunday that fell within that week.|$|E

Unfortunately, {{he turned out to}} be worse than Rossignol who, though brave, was generally understood to be incompetent. When Léchelle arrived at headquarters at Montaigu, Kléber placed a map in front of him and explained the strategy of his predecessor Canclaux. Without bothering to glance at the map, Léchelle replied, [...] "On this terrain it is a question of display. One must march majestically and in mass". As Kléber quietly <b>put</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> map, the representative Antoine Merlin de Thionville declared that the government was appointing the most ignorant generals possible. After discussion, it was agreed that the Nantes and Mayence divisions would continue to march from the west toward Cholet where it would meet converging columns from Luçon and Les Sables d'Olonne in the south and from Bressuire in the east.

2500|$|Meanwhile, Dravid was {{a picture}} of calm and patience, as he played yet another {{important}} innings to turn around India's fortunes. His 92 however, lacked in the polish that was exhibited in his two knocks in Adelaide, as he played and missed sometimes. But he retained an excellent control over almost all bowlers, and played a lot of dot balls, and <b>put</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> bad deliveries for the boundaries, explaining his high boundary rate. Dravid was dismissed by Lee, edging a delivery to Adam Gilchrist behind the stumps. Dravid was dismissed when the score was 253, and was the fifth man out. After his dismissal for a gritty 92, the Indian innings came to an end rather rapidly, as only a further 33 runs were added for the loss of five wickets, including that of Ganguly's who was dismissed for 73. Brad Williams {{turned out to be the}} chief destroyer of the Indian innings with a haul of 4 wickets, and constantly troubled Ganguly. Williams, who was a surprise pick over Andy Bichel, expressed his joy on being able to scalp four against the Indian batting order. He also praised Dravid for his batting. Dravid himself commented that it had been an uphill struggle for most of the day, [...] "It was never comfortable. When me and Sourav were going well, there was a bit of hope. But to be honest, we needed something special to happen, an Eden Gardens or an Adelaide. And those things don't happen everyday.". India's spectacular collapse left Australia needing only 95 runs for a victory.|$|E
