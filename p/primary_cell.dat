5|$|The {{mercury battery}} is a non-rechargeable {{electrochemical}} battery, a <b>primary</b> <b>cell,</b> that was {{common in the}} middle of the 20th century. It was used in a wide variety of applications and was available in various sizes, particularly button sizes. Its constant voltage output and long shelf life gave it a niche use for camera light meters and hearing aids. The mercury cell was effectively banned in most countries in the 1990s due to concerns about the mercury contaminating landfills.|$|E
25|$|In plant biology, pectin {{consists}} of {{a complex set of}} polysaccharides (see below) that are present in most <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> walls and are particularly abundant in the non-woody parts of terrestrial plants. Pectin is a major component of the middle lamella, where it helps to bind cells together, but is also found in <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> walls.|$|E
25|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall, {{generally}} a thin, flexible and extensible layer formed while the cell is growing.|$|E
50|$|A {{stem cell}} line is also {{distinct}} from <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>cells</b> are cells {{that have been}} isolated and then used immediately. <b>Primary</b> <b>cells</b> cannot divide indefinitely and thus cannot be cultured {{for long periods of}} time in vitro.|$|R
40|$|Cell {{lines are}} often used in place of <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> to study {{biological}} processes. However, {{care must be taken}} when interpreting the results as cell lines do not always accurately replicate the <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> In this article, we will briefly talk about advantages and disadvantages of cell lines and then discuss results using the mouse Sertoli cell line, MSC- 1, compared with <b>primary</b> mouse Sertoli <b>cells.</b> MSC- 1 cells resemble Sertoli cells morphologically and possess several biochemical markers associated with Sertoli cells. Studies have demonstrated that the function and regulation of retinoic acid receptor a (RARa) is similar between MSC- 1 and rat Sertoli cells. However, MSC- 1 cells lack some of the immune privilege properties associated with <b>primary</b> Sertoli <b>cells,</b> including survival in animals with a fully functional immune system. Therefore, it has to be kept in mind that cell lines do not behave identically with <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> and should not be used to replace <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> In order to strengthen the findings, key control experiments using <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> should always be performed.

25|$|The {{secondary}} cell wall, {{a thick layer}} formed inside the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall after the cell is fully grown. It is not found in all cell types. Some cells, such as the conducting cells in xylem, possess a secondary wall containing lignin, which strengthens and waterproofs the wall.|$|E
25|$|In 1832, Michael Faraday's {{experiments}} led him {{to state}} his two laws of electrochemistry. In 1836, John Daniell invented a <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> which solved the problem of polarization by eliminating hydrogen gas generation at the positive electrode. Later results revealed that alloying the amalgamated zinc with mercury would produce a higher voltage.|$|E
25|$|The {{middle lamella}} is laid down first, formed from the cell plate during cytokinesis, and the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall is then {{deposited}} inside the middle lamella. The actual {{structure of the}} cell wall is not clearly defined and several models exist - the covalently linked cross model, the tether model, the diffuse layer model and the stratified layer model. However, the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall, {{can be defined as}} composed of cellulose microfibrils aligned at all angles. Cellulose microfibrils are produced at the plasma membrane by the cellulose synthase complex, which is proposed to be made of a hexameric rosette that contains three cellulose synthase catalytic subunits for each of the six units. Microfibrils are held together by hydrogen bonds to provide a high tensile strength. The cells are held together and share the gelatinous membrane called the middle lamella, which contains magnesium and calcium pectates (salts of pectic acid). Cells interact though plasmodesmata, which are inter-connecting channels of cytoplasm that connect to the protoplasts of adjacent cells across the cell wall.|$|E
50|$|Sealed Ni-Cd cells {{may be used}} individually, or {{assembled}} into {{battery packs}} containing two or more cells. Small cells are used for portable electronics and toys (such as solar garden lights), often using cells manufactured in the same sizes as <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> When Ni-Cd batteries are substituted for <b>primary</b> <b>cells,</b> the lower terminal voltage and smaller ampere-hour capacity may reduce performance as compared to <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> Miniature button cells are sometimes used in photographic equipment, hand-held lamps (flashlight or torch), computer-memory standby, toys, and novelties.|$|R
40|$|Cajal bodies (CBs) are nuclear {{structures}} that {{are thought to}} have diverse functions, including small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) biogenesis. The phosphorylation status of coilin, the CB marker protein, might impact CB formation. We hypothesize that <b>primary</b> <b>cells,</b> which lack CBs, contain different phosphoisoforms of coilin compared with that found in transformed cells, which have CBs. Localization, self-association and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies on coilin phosphomutants all suggest this modification impacts the function of coilin and may thus contribute towards CB formation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrates that coilin is hyperphosphorylated in <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> compared with transformed cells. mRNA levels of the nuclear phosphatase PPM 1 G are significantly reduced in <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> and expression of PPM 1 G in <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> induces CBs. Additionally, PPM 1 G can dephosphorylate coilin in vitro. Surprisingly, however, expression of green fluorescent protein alone is sufficient to form CBs in <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> Taken together, our data support a model whereby coilin is the target of an uncharacterized signal transduction cascade that responds to the increased transcription and snRNP demands found in transformed cells...|$|R

25|$|The {{preceding}} implantable devices all {{suffered from}} the unreliability and short lifetime of the available <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> technology which was mainly that of the mercury battery. In the late 1960s, several companies, including ARCO in the USA, developed isotope-powered pacemakers, but this development was overtaken by the development in 1971 of the lithium iodide cell by Wilson Greatbatch. Lithium-iodide or lithium anode cells became the standard for future pacemaker designs.|$|E
25|$|The amount, {{structure}} and chemical composition of pectin differs among plants, within a plant over time, and {{in various parts}} of a plant. Pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide that allows <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall extension and plant growth. During fruit ripening, pectin is broken down by the enzymes pectinase and pectinesterase, in which process the fruit becomes softer as the middle lamellae break down and cells become separated from each other. A similar process of cell separation caused by the breakdown of pectin occurs in the abscission zone of the petioles of deciduous plants at leaf fall.|$|E
25|$|John Daniell began {{experiments}} in 1835 {{in an attempt}} to improve the voltaic battery with its problems of being unsteady and a weak source of electric current. His experiments soon led to remarkable results. In 1836, he invented a <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> in which hydrogen was eliminated in the generation of the electricity. Daniell had solved the problem of polarization. In his laboratory he had learned to alloy the amalgamated zinc of Sturgeon with mercury. His version {{was the first of the}} two-fluid class battery and the first battery that produced a constant reliable source of electric current over a long period of time.|$|E
50|$|Ni-Cd {{cells have}} a nominal cell {{potential}} of 1.2 volts (V). This {{is lower than}} the 1.5 V of alkaline and zinc-carbon <b>primary</b> <b>cells,</b> and consequently they are not appropriate as a replacement in all applications. However, the 1.5 V of a <b>primary</b> alkaline <b>cell</b> refers to its initial, rather than average, voltage. Unlike alkaline and zinc-carbon <b>primary</b> <b>cells,</b> a Ni-Cd cell's terminal voltage only changes a little as it discharges. Because many electronic devices are designed to work with <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> that may discharge to as low as 0.90 to 1.0 V per cell, the relatively steady 1.2 V of a Ni-Cd cell is enough to allow operation. Some would consider the near-constant voltage a drawback as it makes it difficult to detect when the battery charge is low.|$|R
40|$|Background: The MAPK/ERK 1 / 2 serine kinases are primary {{mediators}} of the Ras mitogenic signaling pathway. Phosphorylation by MEK activates MAPK/ERK in the cytoplasm, and phospho-ERK {{is thought}} to enter the nucleus readily to modulate transcription. Principal Findings: Here, however, we observe that in primary cultures of breast and ovarian epithelial cells, phosphorylation and activation of ERK 1 / 2 are disassociated from nuclear translocalization and transcription of downstream targets, such as c-Fos, suggesting that nuclear translocation is limited in <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> Accordingly, in import assays in vitro, <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> showed a lower import activity for ERK 1 / 2 than cancer cells, in which activated MAPK readily translocated into the nucleus and activated c-Fos expression. <b>Primary</b> <b>cells</b> express lower levels of nuclear pore complex proteins and the nuclear transport factors, importin B 1 and importin 7, which may explain the limiting ERK 1 / 2 import found in <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> Additionally, reduction in expression of nucleoporin 153 by siRNA targeting reduced ERK 1 / 2 nuclear activity in cancer cells. Conclusion: ERK 1 / 2 activation is dissociated from nuclear entry, which is a rate limiting step in <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> and in vivo, and the restriction of nuclear entry is disrupted in transformed cells by the increased expression of nuclear pores and/or nuclea...|$|R
50|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>cells,</b> {{for example}} stem cells, {{especially}} {{fall into this}} category, although many other cell lines are also difficult to transfect. <b>Primary</b> <b>cells</b> are freshly isolated from body tissue and thus cells are unchanged, closely resembling the in-vivo situation, and are therefore of particular relevance for medical research purposes. In contrast, cell lines have often been cultured for decades and may significantly differ from their origin.|$|R
25|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s the zinc–carbon battery {{continued}} to be a popular <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> battery, but its relatively low battery life hampered sales. In 1955, an engineer named Lewis Urry, working for Union Carbide at the National Carbon Company Parma Research Laboratory, was tasked with finding a way to extend the life of zinc-carbon batteries, but Urry decided instead that alkaline batteries held more promise. Until then, longer-lasting alkaline batteries were unfeasibly expensive. Urry's battery consisted of a manganese dioxide cathode and a powdered zinc anode with an alkaline electrolyte. Using powdered zinc gave the anode a greater surface area. These batteries hit the market in 1959.|$|E
25|$|The chondroitin sulfate {{proteoglycans}} phosphacan and neurocan {{have also}} been shown {{to play a role in}} glial scar. Phosphacan has been shown to have decreased levels in glial scar when compared to uninjured cortex. This decrease is beneficial to nerve generation because phosphacan has been shown to inhibit neurite extension similarly to the other CSPGs discussed already. Alternatively, neurocan production is up regulated in astrocytes in glial scar when compared to uninjured cortex and astrocytes in <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> culture conditions. These elevated neurocan levels have been shown to remain elevated 30 days after the initial injury. This implicates neurocan as having a prolonged role in chronic scar.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of cell walls varies between species and {{may depend on}} cell type and developmental stage. The <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall of land plants is composed of the polysaccharides cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. Often, other polymers such as lignin, suberin or cutin are anchored to or embedded in plant cell walls. Algae possess cell walls made of glycoproteins and polysaccharides such as carrageenan and agar that are absent from land plants. In bacteria, the cell wall is composed of peptidoglycan. The cell walls of archaea have various compositions, and may be formed of glycoprotein S-layers, pseudopeptidoglycan, or polysaccharides. Fungi possess cell walls made of the glucosamine polymer chitin. Unusually, diatoms have a cell wall composed of biogenic silica.|$|E
40|$|Biofilms {{dominate}} microbial life {{in numerous}} aquatic ecosystems, and in engineered and medical systems, as well. The formation of biofilms is initiated by single <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> colonizing surfaces from the bulk liquid. The next steps from <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> towards the first cell clusters as the initial step of biofilm formation remain relatively poorly studied. Clonal growth and random migration of <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> are traditionally considered {{as the dominant}} processes leading to organized microcolonies in laboratory grown monocultures. Using Voronoi tessellation, we show that the spatial distribution of <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> colonizing initially sterile surfaces from natural streamwater community deviates from uniform randomness already during the very early colonisation. The deviation from uniform randomness increased with colonisation — {{despite the absence of}} cell reproduction — and was even more pronounced when the flow of water above biofilms was multidirectional and shear stress elevated. We propose a simple mechanistic model that captures interactions, such as cell-to-cell signalling or chemical surface conditioning, to simulate the observed distribution patterns. Model predictions match empirical observations reasonably well, highlighting the role of biotic interactions even already during very early biofilm formation despite few and distant cells. The transition from single <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> to clustering accelerated by biotic interactions rather than by reproduction may be particularly advantageous in harsh environments — the rule rather tha...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to find methods to reproducibly propagate human rotaviruses from fecal specimens and to determine the relationship between particle numbers and infectivity. Growth of virus was initially compared in primary and continuous lines of monkey kidney <b>cells.</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>cells</b> (African green and cynomolgus monkey kidney) supported virus growth directly from fecal specimens much more efficiently than did continuous lines of African green (CV- 1) or rhesus (MA 104) monkey kidney cells. Rotaviruses were grown in <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> from 14 of 14 fecal specimens of different individuals collected over a 3 -year period. Although rotaviruses in fecal samples could not always be grown in the continuous cell lines, two passages in <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> appeared to fully adapt the viruses for propagation in the continuous cell line tested (MA 104). The efficiency of rotavirus growth was quantified with five of the fecal isolates. It was calculated that, on the average, 1 out of every 46, 000 particles in fecal specimens infected monkey kidney cells. After three passages in <b>primary</b> <b>cells,</b> an average of 1 out of every 6, 600 progeny virus particles appeared to be infectious. Thus, rotaviruses in fecal specimens were consistently grown in <b>primary</b> <b>cells,</b> and passage in these cells both increased virus infectivity and adapted the viruses for growth in continuous cell lines...|$|R
40|$|Extracellular vesicles (EVs) {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{as a means to}} promote intercellular communication. We show that when human <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> are exposed to cancer cell EVs, rapid cell death of the <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> is observed, while cancer <b>cells</b> treated with <b>primary</b> or cancer <b>cell</b> EVs do not display this response. The active agents that trigger cell death are 29 - to 31 -nucleotide (nt) or 22 - to 23 -nt processed fragments of an 83 -nt primary transcript of the human RNY 5 gene that are highly likely to be formed within the EVs. <b>Primary</b> <b>cells</b> treated with either cancer cell EVs, deproteinized total RNA from either <b>primary</b> or cancer <b>cell</b> EVs, or synthetic versions of 31 - and 23 -nt fragments trigger rapid cell death in a dose-dependent manner. The transfer of processed RNY 5 fragments through EVs may reflect a novel strategy used by cancer cells toward the establishment of a favorable microenvironment for their proliferation and invasion...|$|R
500|$|All {{plants are}} {{multicellular}} eukaryotes, their DNA stored in nuclei. The characteristic features of plant cells that distinguish them {{from those of}} animals and fungi include a <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall composed of the polysaccharides cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin, [...] larger vacuoles than in animal cells {{and the presence of}} plastids with unique photosynthetic and biosynthetic functions as in the chloroplasts. Other plastids contain storage products such as starch (amyloplasts) or lipids (elaioplasts). Uniquely, streptophyte cells and those of the green algal order Trentepohliales divide by construction of a phragmoplast as a template for building a cell plate late in cell division.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the primary}} (growing) plant cell wall, the major {{carbohydrates}} are cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. The cellulose microfibrils are linked via hemicellulosic tethers {{to form the}} cellulose-hemicellulose network, which {{is embedded in the}} pectin matrix. The most common hemicellulose [...] in the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall is xyloglucan. In grass cell walls, xyloglucan and pectin are reduced in abundance and partially replaced by glucuronarabinoxylan, another type of hemicellulose. <b>Primary</b> <b>cell</b> walls characteristically extend (grow) by a mechanism called acid growth, which involves turgor-driven movement of the strong cellulose microfibrils within the weaker hemicellulose/pectin matrix, catalyzed by expansin proteins. The outer part of the <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> wall of the plant epidermis is usually impregnated with cutin and wax, forming a permeability barrier known as the plant cuticle.|$|E

40|$|Pendrin is {{upregulated}} in bronchial {{epithelial cells}} following IL- 4 stimulation via binding of STAT 6 to an N 4 GAS motif. Basal CpG methylation of the pendrin promoter is cell-specific. We studied if a correlation exists between IL- 4 sensitivity and the CpG methylation {{status of the}} pendrin promoter in human bronchial epithelial cell models. Methods: Real-time PCR and pyrosequencing were used to respectively quantify pendrin mRNA levels and methylation of pendrin promoter, with and without IL- 4 stimulation, in healthy and diseased <b>primary</b> HBE <b>cells,</b> as well as NCI-H 292 cells. Results: Increases in pendrin mRNA after IL- 4 stimulation was more robust in NCI-H 292 <b>cells</b> than in <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> The amount of gDNA methylated varied greatly between the cell types. In particular, CpG site 90 located near the N 4 GAS motif was highly methylated in the <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> An additional CpG site (90 bis), created by a SNP, was found only in the <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> IL- 4 stimulation resulted in dramatic demethylation of CpG sites 90 and 90 bis in the <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> Conclusions: IL- 4 induces demethylation of specific CpG sites within the pendrin promoter.

40|$|Continuous {{delivery}} of factor VIII (FVIII) protein in hemophiliacs by gene therapy will represent a major clinical advance over the current practice of infrequent administration of purified FVIII. Conceptually, retroviral vectors that can permanently insert the FVIII gene into the DNA {{of the host}} cell appear the most suitable vehicles for this specific purpose.
