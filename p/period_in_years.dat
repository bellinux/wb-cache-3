We will discuss the possible allocation methods and especially method of auctioning as the most theoretically preferred allocation method. The practical approach will tackle following two aspects: how the emission allowances have been allocated within the EU ETS in Phase 1 and Phase 2 and what the planned changes are in post 2012.

40|$|Abstract. The Sun {{is forced}} into an {{orbit around the}} {{barycenter}} {{of the solar system}} because of the changing mass distributions of the planets. Solarplanetary-lunar dynamic relationships may form a new basis for understanding and predicting cyclic solar forcing functions on the Earth’s climate. 1 Using the NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory planetary ephemeris DE- 102, a time-tabel of paired synodic conjunctions has been prepared for the four major planets extending more than 16. 000 yr in the past and 100 yr into the future (Fairbridge and Sanders, 1987; Sanders and Fairbridge, 1987). While all planetary orbital periods are somewhat irregular over short-term intervals, when calculated over time periods> 1000 yr, long-term means establish a pattern of beat frequencies that conform to a complex harmonic system with an approximately log/log relationship with a constant slope. The slope formula, where v denotes harmonic and u denotes the <b>period</b> (<b>in</b> <b>years),</b> is as follows: log(v) = 6. 04 − log(u) ...|$|E

40|$|In earlier studies, natural {{antibodies}} (NAb) {{were related}} {{not only to}} the energy balance (EB) of dairy cows, but also to somatic cell count (SCC) and clinical mastitis (CM). The first objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of dry period length and dietary energy source on titers of NAb binding keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in plasma and milk, SCC and CM occurrence in dairy cows in two subsequent lactations. Our second objective was to study the relationship between NAb levels and mammary health. Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (N = 167) were randomly assigned to three dry period lengths (0, 30 or 60 -d) and two early lactation rations (glucogenic or lipogenic). Treatments were repeated during two subsequent lactations (years 1 and 2). <b>In</b> <b>year</b> 2, 19 cows which were planned to have 0 -d dry period dried off naturally and were assigned to an additional group 0 → 30 -d dry <b>period.</b> <b>In</b> <b>year</b> 1, cows with a 0 -d dry period had a higher SCC, a higher titer of immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding LPS in plasma, and higher titers of IgG and IgM binding KLH and LPS in milk compared with cows with a 30 -d or 60 -d dry <b>period.</b> <b>In</b> <b>year</b> 2, cows with a 60 -d dry period had a lower SCC than cows with a 30 -d and 0 → 30 -d dry <b>periods.</b> <b>In</b> <b>year</b> 2, dry <b>period</b> length did not affect NAb titers in plasma or milk. The CM occurrence was 17 percent <b>in</b> <b>year</b> 1 of the experiment and 25 percent <b>in</b> <b>year</b> 2, and did not differ according to dry period lengths or rations. For both years, an increasing titer of IgG binding LPS in plasma was associated with decreased odds of a high SCC and decreased odds of CM occurrence. Also up to three weeks before the CM occurrence, an increasing titer of IgM binding KLH and LPS in plasma was associated with a decreased odds of CM occurrence. In conclusion, omitting the dry period increased SCC, NAb titers in milk and IgG binding LPS in plasma compared with a short (30 -d) or conventional (60 -d) dry period. The effects on NAb titers, however, were only present <b>in</b> the first <b>year</b> after omitting the dry period and disappeared after repeated omitting the dry period. Moreover, an increasing titer of IgG binding LPS in plasma was associated with decreased odds of high SCC and CM occurrence. </p...|$|R
