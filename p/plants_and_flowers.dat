The pattern, derived from local <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>flowers,</b> is a traditional type commonly used in Belarus. These patterns are sometimes used in woven garments, most importantly in the traditional 'rushnyk', a woven cloth used for ceremonial events like religious services, funerals, and other more mundane social functions, such as a host offering guests bread and salt served on a rushnyk.|$|E

5|$|The {{method of}} Malaysian batik making is {{different}} from those of Indonesian Javanese batik, the pattern being larger and simpler with only occasional use of the canting to create intricate patterns. It relies heavily on brush painting to apply colours to fabrics. The colours also tend to be lighter and more vibrant than deep coloured Javanese batik. The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers. Malaysian batik often displays <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>flowers</b> to avoid the interpretation of human and animal images as idolatry, in accordance with local Islamic doctrine. However, the butterfly theme is a common exception.|$|E
5|$|In 1882 Stowe {{purchased}} {{a plot of}} land in Mandarin on the St. Johns to build the Mandarin Church of Our Saviour, the dedication of which she attended. The windows of the church were installed by its benefactors. Calvin's health began to fade and in 1884 the Stowe family left Mandarin forever {{to spend the rest}} of their years in Hartford. He died two years later and Stowe asked to add a window in the Mandarin church in his memory, but it remained plain glass for 30 years. The church's parishioners remained so loyal to Stowe that they neglected to suggest an alternate plan for the window. Stowe declined into a childlike state after 1894, losing much of her memory but keeping her fascination with <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>flowers</b> as she would wander Hartford exclaiming over those she came across. She died in 1896.|$|E

5|$|Plants figure {{prominently}} in mythology and religion, where they symbolise themes such as fertility, growth, immortality and rebirth, {{and may be}} more or less magical. Thus in Latvian mythology, Austras Koks is a tree which grows {{from the start of the}} Sun's daily journey across the sky. A different cosmic tree is Yggdrasil, the World tree of Norse mythology, on which Odin hung. Different again is the barnacle tree, believed in the Middle Ages to have barnacles that opened to reveal geese, a story which may perhaps have started from an observation of goose barnacles growing on driftwood. Greek mythology mentions many <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>flowers,</b> where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebee {{species are}} declining in Europe, North America, and Asia {{due to a}} number of factors, {{including}} land-use change that reduces their food plants. In North America, pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus Bombus. A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture, accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the Second World War. Small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts. The horses were fed on clover and hay, both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm. Little artificial fertiliser was used. Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower-rich meadows, favouring bumblebees. Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses, outcompeting the meadow flowers. Most of the flowers, and the bumblebees that fed on them, disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s. The last native British short-haired bumblebee was captured near Dungeness in 1988. This significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the Bombus genus. The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways: by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide, or through physical contact with treated <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>flowers.</b> The species Bombus hortorum in particular {{has been found to be}} impacted by the pesticides; their brood development has been reduced and their memory has been negatively affected. Additionally, pesticide use negatively impacts colony development and size.|$|E

Greek mythology mentions many <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>flowers,</b> where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms. Magic plants are found, too, in Serbian mythology, where the raskovnik is supposed to be able to open any lock. In Buddhist symbolism, both the lotus and the Bodhi Tree are significant. The lotus is one of the Ashtamangala (eight auspicious signs) shared between Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, representing the primordial purity of body, speech, and mind, floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire. The Bodhi Tree is the sacred fig tree under which the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment; the name is also given to other Bodhi trees thought to have been propagated from the original tree.|$|E

25|$|The {{science of}} botany was long {{established}} by Leonardo's time, a treatise {{on the subject}} having been written as early as 300BCE. Leonardo's study of plants, resulting in many beautiful drawings in his notebooks, was not to record in diagramatic form {{the parts of the}} plant, but rather, as an artist and observer to record the precise appearance of plants, the manner of growth and the way that individual <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>flowers</b> of a single variety differed from one another.|$|E
25|$|In December 1903, a new Allendale Village Improvement Association was established.

However, all the beautification did not stop burglars from regularly robbing the depot; they often took money from the vending machines. In 1913, the post office moved from the station to a store in town. In 1916, the Allendale Christmas Tree Association was established and began regularly putting a Christmas tree in the Allendale station square. Toilets were installed in March1917.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{sacrifice}} can {{be divided}} into two types: autosacrifice and human sacrifice. The different forms of sacrifice are reflected in the imagery used to evoke ideological structure and sociocultural organization in Mesoamerica. In the Maya area, for example, stele depict bloodletting rituals performed by ruling elites, eagles and jaguars devouring human hearts, jade circles or necklaces that represented hearts, and <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>flowers</b> that symbolized both nature and the blood that provided life. Imagery also showed pleas for rain or pleas for blood, with the same intention to replenish the divine energy.|$|E
