5|$|The Carnival of the Animals, Finale was {{directed}} by Goldberg; his wife Susan was its art director. The idea originated from animator Joe Grant, {{one of the two}} story directors on Fantasia who loved the ostriches in Dance of the Hours. When development for Fantasia 2000 began, Grant suggested the idea of having one of the ostriches <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> yo-yo to the last movement of The Carnival of the Animals. The ostriches were later changed to flamingos as Disney wished to avoid reintroducing characters from the original film and thought flamingos would look more colorful on the screen. Goldberg was partly inspired by co-director Mike Gabriel, who would <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> yo-yo as he took a break from working on Pocahontas (1995). The segment was produced with CGI and 6,000 watercolor paintings on heavy bond paper.|$|E

5|$|By {{achieving}} high rankings {{throughout the}} season, the Big Ten {{was able to}} keep at least three teams in the top 10 of the national polls during 10 of the 11 weeks of the conference portion of the season. As a result, the Big Ten set a record for most matchups between two top 10 opponents in conference <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> total of 9 such games. Michigan played in six with a 3–3 record and Indiana played in five, winning all of them. Michigan State, Minnesota and Ohio State also played in top 10 games.|$|E
5|$|Each {{contestant}} had {{the same}} decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt {{to answer the question}} or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular <b>play,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question {{at the end of the}} tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.|$|E
5|$|In high school, Lukather met David Paich and the Porcaro {{brothers}} (Jeff, Steve, and Mike), {{all of whom}} {{eventually became}} members of Toto.

5|$|Jovanovski {{is known}} as a two-way defenceman. Able to {{contribute}} offensively, he is an adept puck-carrier and joins plays deep in the opposing team's zone. He plays defence physically, bodychecking opponents primarily with his shoulder. In both aspects of his game, he is considered to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high level of risk, taking the chance of being out of position in favour of a good scoring chance or a hit.|$|E
5|$|Many of Riley's {{poems are}} filled with musical references. Riley had no musical education, and could not read sheet music, but learned from his father how to play guitar, and from a friend how to play violin. He {{performed}} in two different local bands, and became so proficient on the violin {{he was invited to}} <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> group of adult Freemasons at several events. A few of his later poems were set to music and song, one of the most well known being A Short'nin' Bread Song—Pieced Out.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} Air Force {{play of the}} second half, quarterback Chance Harridge ran up {{the middle of the}} field for a 21-yard gain. The Falcons {{followed}} that first-down <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> series of rushes that resulted in another first down, this time in Virginia Tech territory. But as the Hokies had done before them, the Falcons faltered inside opposition territory. Instead of punting the ball, however, Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry kept his offense on the field to attempt to gain the needed twoyards on fourth down. The attempt was unsuccessful, and Tech's offense returned to the field with 7:40 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|Several basic {{offensive}} tactics {{come into}} <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> runner on first base, including the fundamental choice {{of whether to}} attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating {{a gap in the}} infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even {{at the expense of the}} batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze <b>play.</b> <b>With</b> <b>a</b> runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.|$|E
5|$|Teemu Selänne of Finland scored his 37th point, {{breaking}} {{the record of}} 36 first set by Canadian Harry Watson in 1924 and later tied by Vlastimil Bubník of Czechoslovakia, and Valeri Kharlamov of the Soviet Union. Slovakia made the final four for the first time, but lost the bronze medal game to Finland. In the gold medal game, Canada and the United States ended regulation <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2–2 tie, making it only the second Olympic gold medal match to go into overtime. Canadian player Sidney Crosby scored the winning goal 7:40 into overtime play to give Canada its eighth gold medal in men's hockey.|$|E
5|$|The Seminoles {{returned}} Tech's post-score kick {{to their}} 15-yard line, where Florida State's offense began work again, hoping {{to regain the}} lead for State. Weinke completed a seven-yard pass to Warrick, then was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense. Weinke overcame the loss on the next <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 19-yard first-down pass. State continued to advance the ball with short passes, as Weinke completed a five-yard throw. Chaney gained three yards on a rush to the right as the final seconds {{of the third quarter}} ticked off the clock, setting up an important third-down play. With one quarter remaining, Virginia Tech led Florida State, 2928.|$|E

5|$|The rules {{had been}} in use since the {{establishment}} of the club. Although a selection of rules from public schools were seen there, the 1858 rules show little evidence of their influence. Many of the original members were from the local Collegiate School, which favoured the kicking style of the game, rather than handling the ball. The kicking game was also prevalent in the local villages of Penistone and Thurlstone. The rules were the first to penalise foul <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> free kick, introduce the throw-in and eliminate the offside rule. They also had the unique feature of preventing a goal being scored directly from a free kick or throw-in.|$|E
5|$|The same year, Lloyd {{played in}} her first FIFA Women's World Cup tournament. Heading into the tournament, the {{national}} team had not conceded a game in regulation time in nearly three years and was considered a favorite to win the tournament in China. During their first match of the tournament, the U.S. tied North Korea 2–2. The team faced Sweden in their next match on September 14 and won 2–0 with two goals from Abby Wambach. The U.S. finished group <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 1–0 win over Nigeria women's national football team on September 18.|$|E
5|$|A PAT is most {{commonly}} attempted from the two- or three-yard line, {{depending on the}} level of play. If scored by a placekick or dropkick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, and is typically called the extra point. Conversely, a team may elect to run a single play from scrimmage and attempt, once again, to achieve what would normally be considered a touchdown. In such a case, a successful attempt is called the two-point conversion and is worth two points. For the 2015 season, the NFL adopted a rules on PATs that stated during an extra point the placekick must be kicked at the 15-yard line and on extra points if the kick is blocked and the opposing team returns it into the end zone or if during a two-point conversion the ball is fumbled or intercepted and returned to the end zone the opposing team will score two points. No points are awarded on a failed extra point or two-point conversion attempt. In general, the extra point is almost always successful in professional play and is only slightly less successful at amateur levels, while the two-point conversion is a much riskier <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> higher probability of failure; accordingly, extra point attempts are far more common than two-point conversion attempts.|$|E

5|$|Czechoslovakia {{split into}} the Czech Republic and Slovakia in January 1993. The IIHF {{recognized}} the Czech Republic as {{the successor to}} Czechoslovakia, allowing the team to retain {{its position in the}} top World Championship division, while Slovakia started in the lowest division (Pool C) in 1994 and was forced to work its way up. Both nations competed in the tournament at the 1994 Winter Olympics, as did Russia. Slovakia and Finland both finished the preliminary round undefeated. Slovakia lost their medal round quarter-final game to Russia, who later lost to Finland in the bronze medal game. In the gold medal game between Sweden and Canada, both teams finished regulation and overtime <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2–2 tie. In the resulting shootout, the first in Olympic competition, both nations scored two goals, which resulted in a sudden death shootout. Peter Forsberg of Sweden scored {{one of the most famous}} goals in Olympic history by faking a forehand shot, then sliding a one-handed backhand shot past goaltender Corey Hirsch. Canada's final shooter Paul Kariya's shot was saved by Tommy Salo and Sweden won the game and its first gold medal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the preseason}} polls, Alabama opened the 2011 {{season as the}} No.2 ranked team in both the AP and Coaches' Polls. After they {{defeated}} the Kent State Golden Flashes 48–7 in the season opener, Alabama dropped to No.3 in the AP Poll {{as a result of}} LSU's victory over Oregon. In Week 2, the Crimson Tide traveled to Beaver Stadium {{for the first time since}} 1989 to play the Penn State Nittany Lions. They defeated the No.23 Nittany Lions 27–11, and returned to Tuscaloosa for a pair of home games against the North Texas Mean Green and the Arkansas Razorbacks. Against North Texas, the Alabama defense was dominant and secured the first shutout for the Crimson Tide defense since the 2009 season with their 41–0 victory. The following week, Alabama opened conference <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 38–14 victory over No.14 Arkansas and then defeated the No.12 Florida Gators 38–10 to extend their record to 5–0. After their victory over Florida, the Crimson Tide regained their No.2 ranking in the AP Poll.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-finals, Brechin faced another {{home game}} against a First Division club, this time against Falkirk. The score was 0–0 {{for most of}} the game before Falkirk took the lead with only three minutes left to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> goal from Craig McPherson. However, Brechin scored one minute before the end through Kevin Fotheringham to force extra time. The score {{remained}} equal after extra time so the winner was decided by a penalty shoot-out; Brechin winning 5–3. With four clubs left in the tournament, Brechin were drawn against Third Division club Queen's Park at Hampden Park. Queen's Park scored first through James Allan after 26 minutes but Brechin equalised before half time with a goal from Marc Millar. The rest of the game's five goals came during a nine-minute period in the second half; Brechin took a two-goal lead courtesy of Chris Jackson and Kevin Fotheringham to make the score 3–1 before goals from John Gemmell and Jonny Whelan for Queen's Park and Roddy Grant for Brechin made the scoreline 4–3 in favour of Brechin. Both teams had chances to score again before the end but the score stayed the same ensuring Brechin qualified for the first national cup final in the club's history.|$|E
