The practical part had three aims: the knowledge of peripheral venous cannulation in <b>paramedics</b> was investigated by half-structured interviews; than the skills in peripheral venous cannulation in <b>paramedics</b> were investigated by own observation of the investigator; the experience of emergency doctors with peripheral venous cannulation by <b>paramedics</b> was investigated using half-structured interviews.

5|$|Howarth {{started his}} career in the youth system of {{hometown}} club York City in 1996 while a schoolboy, before becoming a trainee in 1998. He made his first-team debut aged 17, playing in the first six matches of the 1999–2000 season. During this run in the team, he signed a professional contract with the club. However, he was unable to play regularly for York because of the form of Bobby Mimms and Alan Fettis. After having trials with Premier League and First Division clubs, Howarth left York in November 2002 to sign for Tranmere Rovers for a five-figure fee. Here, he again played sporadically, only having runs in the team when first-choice goalkeeper John Achterberg was unavailable. After being released by Tranmere in 2005, Howarth signed for Bradford City. However, he was unable to dislodge Donovan Ricketts in goal and was released in 2007.
