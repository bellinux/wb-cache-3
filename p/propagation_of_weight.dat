One approach is to investigate the spread of positive health outcomes through a social network. We employ the ground concepts of spread maximization problem and adapt it to best reflect the dynamics of a weight loss intervention. A diffusion model is then employed for the <b>propagation</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> loss effect throughout the network of obese and overweight individuals. This diffusion model integrates both personal attributes and network-related attributes of an individual while engaged in a weight loss program. Simulation findings suggest that choosing initial agents based on individual attributes, including ability to lose weight, body mass index, and threshold, produced the highest total weight loss in the network. Greedy algorithm was also applied to choose the most effective subset of initial seeds...|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} is a {{fully connected}} feed forward network that includes {{at least one}} hidden layer 16. The hidden layer 16 includes nodes 20 in which {{the output of the}} node is fed back to that node as an input with a unit delay produced by a delay device 24 occurring in the feedback path 22 (local feedback). Each node within each layer also receives a delayed output (crosstalk) produced by a delay unit 36 from all the other nodes within the same layer 16. The node performs a transfer function operation based on the inputs from the previous layer and the delayed outputs. The network can be implemented as analog or digital or within a general purpose processor. Two teaching methods can be used: (1) back <b>propagation</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> calculation that includes the local feedback and the crosstalk or (2) more preferably a feed forward gradient decent which immediately follows the output computations and which also includes the local feedback and the crosstalk. Subsequent to the gradient propagation, the weights can be normalized, thereby preventing convergence to a local optimum. Education of the network can be incremental both on and off-line. An educated network is suitable for modeling and controlling dynamic nonlinear systems and time series systems and predicting the outputs as well as hidden states and parameters. The educated network can also be further educated during on-line processing...|$|E

A general form for the Helmholtz energy is proposed and the resulting constitutive laws are derived from logical, thermodynamically consistent argumentation. The chapter concludes by comparing the model developed here to various others in the literature. The approach adopted to derive the governing equations is not specific to case II diffusion, rather it encompasses {{a wide range of}} applications wherein heat conduction, species diffusion and finite inelastic effects are coupled.

The transient <b>propagation</b> <b>of</b> cracks is modelled. An improved potential energy method is proposed by incorporating the propagation model into the potential energy method.
