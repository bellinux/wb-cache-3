5|$|The {{defensive}} {{architecture of}} the castle also contains various weaknesses. The Inner Court is overlooked by the Bailey, for example; {{the north of the}} Inner Court is largely exposed, while the positioning of arrow-slits in the curtain wall ignores much of the castle. The open-backed mural towers, whilst cheaper to build than closed towers, could not have been easily defended once the wall had been penetrated, and because they projected only a little way from the wall, they provided very little options for enfilading fire against attackers close to the walls. These weaknesses have been used by historians such as Robert Liddiard to argue that the architecture of castles such as Framlingham were influenced by cultural and <b>political</b> <b>requirements</b> as well as purely military intent.|$|E

Ivan Leonidov's final project at Vkhutemas was his design for a Lenin Institute of Librarianship. Vladimir Tatlin's Monument to the Third International was built by students and displayed at their workshop in Saint Petersburg. Furthermore, Lenin's Mausoleum was designed by faculty member Aleksey Shchusev. Alexei Gan's book Constructivism, published in 1922, provided a theoretical link between the new emerging art and contemporary politics, connecting constructivism with the revolution, and Marxism.

500|$|A {{more radical}} {{questioning}} of Tzara's influence came from Romanian essayist Petre Pandrea.

[...] Himself an adherent to communism, Pandrea grew disillusioned with the ideology, and later became a political prisoner in Communist Romania.

Class-based <b>political</b> <b>requirements</b> steered artists toward crafts, and the designing of household or industrial goods. There was significant pressure in this respect by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, that in 1926, 1927, and 1928, required a student body composition [...] "of worker and peasant origins", and several demands for [...] "working class" [...] elements. This push for design economy resulted in a tendency towards working, functional designs with minimised luxuries. Tables designed by Rodchenko were equipped with mechanical moving parts, and were standardised and multi-functional. The products designed at Vkhutemas never bridged the gap between workshops and factory production, although they cultivated a factory aesthetic—Popova, Stepanova, and Tatlin even designed worker's industrial apparel. Furniture pieces constructed at Vkhutemas explored the possibilities of new industrial materials such as plywood and tubular steel.|$|E

2500|$|The {{counties}} of Ireland ( [...] ; Ulster-Scots: coonties o Airlann) are sub-national divisions that have been, {{and in some}} cases continue to be, used to geographically demarcate areas of local government. These land divisions were formed following the Norman invasion of Ireland in imitation of the counties then in use as units of local government in the Kingdom of England. The older term [...] "shire" [...] was historically equivalent to [...] "county". The principal function of the county was to impose royal control in the areas of taxation, security and the administration of justice at the local level. Cambro-Norman control was initially limited to the southeastern parts of Ireland; a further four centuries elapsed before the entire island was shired. At the same time, the now obsolete concept of county corporate elevated a small number of towns and cities to a status which was deemed to be no less important than the existing counties in which they lay. This double control mechanism of 32 counties plus 10 counties corporate remained unchanged for a little over two centuries until the early 19th century, since then counties have been adapted {{and in some cases}} divided by legislation to meet new administrative and <b>political</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Murfreesboro was a {{small town}} in the Stones River Valley, a former state capital named for a colonel in the American Revolutionary War, Hardy Murfree. All through the war it was a center for strong Confederate sentiment, and Bragg and his men were warmly welcomed and entertained during the month of December. It was located in a rich {{agricultural}} region from which Bragg planned to provision his army and a position that he intended to use to block a potential U.S. advance on Chattanooga. Hardee noted afterward that [...] "The field of battle offered no particular advantages for defense." [...] Despite this, Bragg was reluctant to move farther south, say to the arguably more defensible Duck River Valley, or farther north, to Stewart's Creek, where Rosecrans thought Bragg would defend. Sensitive to the <b>political</b> <b>requirements</b> that almost no Tennessee ground be yielded to U.S. control, he chose the relatively flat area northwest of the politically influential city, straddling the Stones River. Portions of the area, particularly near the intersection of the Nashville Pike and the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, were characterized by small but dense cedar forests, in places more impenetrable to infantry than the Wilderness of Spotsylvania in Virginia. Short limestone outcroppings, separated by narrow cracks as if rows of teeth, impeded the movement of wagons and artillery. Hardee's Corps was initially placed in Triune, about 20 miles (32km) to the west, Polk's on {{the west bank of the}} river, and a detached division from Hardee's Corps under Maj. Gen. John C.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. The Old Hittite polychrome relief-decorated vases have {{attracted}} scholarly interest {{since the first}} substantial fragment was discovered at Bitik in the 1940 s. Academics have concurred that the vases illustrate cult practice, but have differed {{as to whether the}} figures portray the king or the gods, both, or neither. The publishing in 2008 of a second nearly complete vase now permits a programmatic comparison between it and the famous İnandıktepe vase (published 1988). This thesis studies the vases’ decorative program and contends that the relief vases represent centralized monumental art. In contrast with iconography of the preceding and later periods, the vases portray gods without attributes. Similarly, the vases’ reliefs depict an anonymous king who engages alongside others in cult activities. Rank is de-emphasized. The focus on solidarity within the ruling group recalls the major historical document of the period, the Edict of Telepinu. Material evidence also links the vases to the network of royal storehouses, listed {{in the second part of}} the Edict.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a logic of argumentation for the {{specification}} and verification (LA 4 SV) of requirements on Dung’s abstract argumentation frameworks. We distinguish {{three kinds of}} decision problems for argumentation verification, called extension verification, framework verification, and specification verification respectively. For example, given a <b>political</b> <b>requirement</b> like “if the argument to increase taxes is accepted, then the argument to increase services must be accepted too,” we can either verify an extension of acceptable arguments, or all extensions of an argumentation framework, or all extensions of all argumentation frameworks satisfying a framework specification. We introduce the logic of argumentation verification to specify such requirements, and we represent the three verification problems of argumentation as model checking and theorem proving properties of the logic. Moreover, we recast the logic of argumentation verification in a modal framework, in order to express multiple extensions, and properties like transitivity and reflexivity of the attack relation. Finally, we introduce a logic of meta-argumentation where abstract argumentation is used to reason about abstract argumentation itself. We define the logic of meta-argumentation using the fibring methodology {{in such a way}} to represent attack relations not only among arguments but also among attacks...|$|R

The objective is to address such areras as data requirements, management and filtering along with the necessary control strategies essential for effective interoperability in a networked coalition force.

40|$|By itself, sub-state {{terrorism}} rarely, if ever, has had {{a significant}} historical impact, except perhaps {{in a few cases}} of political assassination or where the tolerance of the terrorized for casualties is very low. Beyond this, any historically significant developments that emerge from terrorism generally derive not from the act itself, but from the reactions, or overreactions, of states and electorates to that act. Sometimes these reactions are self-defeating or even self-destructive, and very often they play {{into the hands of the}} terrorists. In many respects, then, the way to defeat terrorism is for states and peoples to exercise self-control, to restrain their reactions and, in particular, their desires to overreact.
