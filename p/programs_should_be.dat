5|$|Upon {{his release}} from active duty, Madgwick {{spent the rest of}} 1946 as Executive Officer for the Commonwealth Inter-Departmental Committee on Education in Canberra. In this role, he helped plan and {{establish}} the Australian National University, acting as secretary on the new university's interim council. At the same time he served as Secretary to the first Commonwealth Committee which allocated federal funds to universities for research. Madgwick later explained that these experiences at the federal government level influenced his belief that adult education <b>programs</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> decentralised to the state level. He added that the experience with Australian National University helped him in later establishing the University of New England as an independent school.|$|E

30|$|An {{effective}} QA <b>program</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{practical to}} implement {{in a clinical}} setting.

25|$|Finally, the Ministry of Transport and Public Works {{considered}} in December 1969 that the broadcast of Howl contravened the licence of operation of Yleisradio: it was neither educational nor useful. Yleisradio received a reprimand, and {{was instructed to}} be more careful when monitoring that no more such <b>programs</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> broadcast.|$|E
25|$|Eaton et al. advises that, when {{controlling}} {{an outbreak}} of SeV, disinfecting the laboratory environment and vaccinating the breeders, as well as eliminating infected animals and screening incoming animals, should clear the problem very quickly.

500|$|Edward Latessa, {{professor}} {{and head of}} division of criminal justice at the University of Cincinnati, declared that the prisoners who are dancing are not being rehabilitated. Latessa stated that the prisoners may {{think that they are}} getting something out of the performances, when, in reality, they are not. He described it as having a potentially harmful effect. The professor insisted that more appropriate rehabilitation programs, like substance abuse or family reunification <b>programs,</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> implemented with as much coordination and vigor. The detention workers disagreed with the assessment, deeming the activities to {{be an integral part of}} rehabilitation. [...] "It combines the need for physical exercise and their love to sing and dance", Thomeczeck argued. [...] "In more ways than one, it contributes to their rehabilitation and eventual reintegration. It's a way to put themselves together physically and probably spiritually. That's good, isn't it?". Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Now that's a 'breakout' hit: The clip of inmates at a high-security prison in the Philippines performing an intricately choreographed dance to Michael Jackson's [...] "Thriller" [...] has nabbed more than 42 million views since 2007." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to some, {{the fact}} that the PCT does not deal {{directly}} with the scope of patentable subject matter, in relation to computer programs, adds [...] "weight to the contention that, having been born out of administrative inconvenience rather than any great principle, restrictions on patentability of <b>programs</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> limited to the maximum possible extent." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1959, {{computer}} experts from industry and government were brought together in a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL). Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language COBOL (an acronym for COmmon Business-Oriented Language). The new language extended Hopper's FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the IBM equivalent, COMTRAN. [...] Hopper's belief that <b>programs</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> written in a language that was close to English (rather than in machine code or in languages close to machine code, such as assembly languages) was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on {{to be the most}} ubiquitous business language to date. Among the members of the committee that worked on COBOL was Mount Holyoke College alumni Jean E. Sammet.|$|E
