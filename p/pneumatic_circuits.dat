50|$|In 1997, LEGO {{introduced}} the Air Tank, which {{acts like a}} battery, storing compressed air so that even more powerful <b>pneumatic</b> <b>circuits</b> can be created. This piece is very popular with the enthusiast community, but many feel that it was underutilised by LEGO, as it only appeared in 3 model sets and a parts pack. This tank is now only available at the LEGO Education Store, along with a new manometer part.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, {{several new}} pieces were {{introduced}} in this line as well. The new pump was spring based, and could only be operated by hand, which limited pneumatic power to how fast it could be manually pumped. This obviously limited the power of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>circuits.</b> So in 1992, LEGO introduced two new pieces; a small pump and a small cylinder. The small pump {{did not have a}} spring on it, and it was designed to be operated by a motor, which would allow for continuously-running pneumatic creations. As of 2011, the small pump has only appeared in one set — 8868 Air Tech Claw Rig (1992) (found on Peeron) — and a few parts sets (no longer available). A new version of the small pump was released in Lego set 8110 Unimog U400 (2011). At 2L, this pump's stroke is 1/3 longer than the old one's 1.5L, 'L' being the LEGO unit of a stud. This made it much easier to use in studless construction.|$|E

This paper deals with multidisciplinary modelling of a vehicle equipped with such a suspension taking into account both multibody and pneumatic aspects. First, it depicts in more detail the various elements of a pneumatic; suspension. Then, many criteria that influence the suspension morphology are presented: the kind of bogie, the use of an auxiliary tank, the position of this tank relative to the bellows, the kind of levelling system, the use of all additional anti-roll bar, the use of an additional hydraulic damper, etc. The description of the complete <b>pneumatic</b> <b>Circuit</b> implies the use of thermodynamic models which take into account the airflow through the pipes and the valves, the pressure in the bellows, etc, Several pipe models are presented, the choice depending on the length of the pipe: an algebraic model is sufficient for short pipes, while a differential model is needed {{to take into account the}} dynamics of longer pipes. The pneumatic model is then coupled with a SIMPACK multibody model in order to analyse the behaviour of the complete vehicle.

Then we define the concept of hypothesis testing in a logic framework. We describe knowledge acquisition events and learning effects. It is argued that knowledge acquisition stimulated by Intelligent Design and Modelling Environments is based fundamentally on self explaining the responses of the system to the student's hypotheses. Furthermore, we will show how the concepts of hypotheses testing and self explanation of the system‘s feedback apply to the four case systems presented. Thus the topic of this paper is the epistemological implication: If there is empirical evidence for the ISP-DL-Knowledge Acquisition Theory which relies on self explanation then Intelligent Design and Modelling Environments should be designed like our systems which stimulate self explanation...|$|E
40|$|Resistors are {{considered}} to be indispensable passive elements to make up <b>pneumatic</b> <b>circuits</b> and to invesngate characteristics of a fluid amplifier, but few resistors which have linear characteristics have been found. 　A new type resistor, slit type resistor, made of a brass bar is proposed in this paper. Slits are cut from the outer surface of the circumference {{to the center of the}} bar as many as possible. Supposing the cross section of a slit is a rectangle, the theory is obtained by considering all slits as the collection of rectangular tubes. Their static characteristics are almost linear and well confirmed the theory. 　These slit type resistors are easily made by machine tool, however, it is difficuit to make them in the case that the bar has a small diameter (under φ 5). Therefore, it is convenient to connect the resistors with a large diameter to a tube with a small diameter. And then, several connectors such as enlargements and contractions are made, and static characteristics of these resistors are investigated. The results are summarised as follows:　 1) It is desirable to narrow the width of a slit and to increase the depth and the number of it. 　 2) The length of resistors is desirable to be chosen about 35 - 65 mm. 　 3) Series and parallel connection of these resistors are now available keeping the linear characteristics. In the series connection, the interval between each resistor does not affect the total resistance. Nor the branched angle does in the parallel connection. 　 4) Geometrical configurations of connectors do not affect the static characteristics though loss coefficient of pressure are large at low Reynolds number. 　 5) The change of the diameter of slender tubes does not affect the static characteristics to the extent (d_ 2) /(d_ 1...|$|E

Spurred by the improvements in the microprocessor speed, miniaturization, and software development, the automobile continues to evolve. In this new approach proposed, I am going to have an electronic and a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>circuit</b> to automatically control the traction of the vehicle. During ordinary conditions, when the vehicle is driven down a straight road, or if the difference between speeds of the two (rear) wheels is below a specified limit, no signal will be generated by the electronic circuit. This helps the vehicle negotiate the turns with better traction control as differential action is unaltered. But if the difference between speeds is beyond a specified limit, the signal will be generated by the electronic circuit which will actuate the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>circuit.</b> This causes gradual braking on the faster wheel until it gains traction. Hence, the wheels will never lose traction.
