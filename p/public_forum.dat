National Road 555 was completed in 1957, and the following years various road projects were completed.|$|E
5|$|Hearing of the unrest, Ottawa sent three emissaries to the Red River, {{including}} HBC representative Donald Alexander Smith. While {{they were}} en route, the Métis National Committee declared a provisional government on 8 December, with Riel becoming its president on 27 December. Meetings between Riel and the Ottawa delegation {{took place on}} 5 and 6 January 1870, but when these proved fruitless, Smith chose to present his case in a <b>public</b> <b>forum.</b> Smith assured large audiences of the Government's goodwill in meetings on 19 and 20 January, leading Riel to propose {{the formation of a}} new convention split evenly between French and English settlers to consider Smith's instructions. On 7 February, a new list of rights was presented to the Ottawa delegation, and Smith and Riel agreed to send representatives to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiations on that basis. The provisional government established by Louis Riel published its own newspaper titled New Nation and established the Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia to pass laws.|$|E
5|$|Parks and Recreation faced early {{production}} delays because Poehler {{was pregnant}} when she signed on; filming {{had to be}} postponed until she gave birth. Principal photography began on February 18, 2009. The show was filmed in Southern California, and the construction pit featured throughout the season was dug by the episode's producers at an undeveloped property in Van Nuys, a district of Los Angeles. The producers went door-to-door in the neighborhood, seeking residents' permission for the dig. The pit was guarded 24hours a day, and paparazzi regularly came to the set to take photos of the actors during filming. The exterior of the Pawnee government building, {{and several of the}} hallway scenes, were shot at Pasadena City Hall. The parks and recreation department interiors, as well as the Town Hall courtyard, were filmed on a sound stage. The set's windows were outfitted with water systems to simulate falling rain, and the windowsills included fake pigeons. Scenes set in playgrounds and elsewhere outdoors were filmed on location in Los Angeles, and the <b>public</b> <b>forum</b> scenes in the premiere episode were filmed in one of the city's middle schools.|$|E

25|$|With {{the shift}} in {{shopping}} from publicly owned Main Streets to privately held shopping malls, the question of access to malls, and their shoppers, as a <b>public</b> <b>forum</b> has been an issue raised nationwide. This issue has become particularly relevant in New Jersey, where malls in both suburban and exurban areas have largely supplanted local downtown districts as shopping destinations, depriving individuals and organizations of a public location {{to reach out to}} neighbors for distribution of fliers and other forms of expression. While different conclusions have been reached elsewhere, New Jersey's approach {{has been one of the}} most expansive in providing groups with access to malls as a <b>public</b> <b>forum,</b> despite their private ownership.|$|E
