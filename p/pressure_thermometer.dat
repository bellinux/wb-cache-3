40|$|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) is in {{the process}} of {{upgrading}} its detectors. Among these upgrades is the need for more transfer lines containing both liquid nitrogen and helium gas. These two fluids are used to provide the necessary operating cryogenic temperatures for the various detectors, such as the Visible Light Photon Counter (VLPC) and the solenoid inside the detector's calorimeter. With additional piping, it is important to monitor the temperatures to assure that the detectors can operate correctly. This can be done two ways. The first method is to use a Resistance Temperature Device, called a RTD, which is made using either a carbon resistor or a platinum resistor and measures the temperature based on resistance. The second method is to use a vapor-pressure thermometry system. This design will focus on the second method. A nitrogen Vapor <b>Pressure</b> <b>Thermometer</b> (VPT) system is designed to determine the temperature of the liquid nitrogen (LN{sub 2 }) supply line, after exiting the LN{sub 2 } subcooler, inside the D-Zero Assembly Hall. The operating temperature range is designed from 77 to 300 Kelvin with an initial charge pressure of 100 psia.

The amount of nitrogen needed to fill the cylindrical bulb approximately half full is 0. 149 grams. In order to conform to the conventional cold volume and warm volume VPT systems, we need to enlarge the existing 1 / 2 -inch x 2 -inch SCH. 10 LN{sub 2 } supply line over a one foot section to 1 -inch x 3 -inch SCH. 10 piping...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Nowadays in many {{countries}} “massage” as {{an important part of}} nursing care is considered and in many clinical situations it is used as complementary treatment for stress reduction. This study with the goal of comparing of reflexive and stroke massages on physiologic indices in patients with MI was performed. Methods: This clinical trial was performed in 2012 on 105 patients who were randomly assigned into three groups: reflexive massage, stroke massage and control groups (each with 35 patients). In the intervention groups each patient took massages for 15 minutes in morning and afternoon in one day. Vital signs and arterial O 2 saturation were measured before and after the massage by blood <b>pressure</b> cuff, <b>thermometer,</b> and pulse oxymeter. Paired T test and X 2 test were used to analyze data. Results: The stroke massage produced significant difference between arterial O 2 saturation levels (p = 0. 002) and temperature rates (p = 0. 017) in morning and afternoon in a day. Reflexive massage as well, causing significant difference between the mean of heart rate and temperature rates in morning and afternoon in a day (P= 0. 001). No significant differences in physiologic indices were seen in control group. Conclusion: Results showed that both massages were effective on vital signs, but stroke massage besides effect on vital signs of the patients, had a positive effect on their arterial O 2 saturations, so doing this massages on these patients is recommended. ...|$|R
40|$|For this {{research}} paper the question posed was “Is there a hospital procedure {{that needs to}} be updated? 2 ̆ 2 To answer that question data was collected from numerous nursing journals and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention to analyze the need for better hygiene of the equipment that comes into contact with the patient. Some of the items that were discussed in the research include: stethoscopes, blood <b>pressure</b> cuffs, <b>thermometers,</b> keyboards, phones, bedside tables, electrocardiogram (ECG) wires, and lab coats. From the evidence based practice research articles, it was evident that more focus needs to be placed on the daily cleaning and disinfection of equipment that receives frequent use to assess patients. It was evident after being in the facility on two separate occasions that a need for further education and reinforcement on proper disinfectant practices was needed. Some related interventions that should be included are reinforcement of proper cleaning techniques of patient care equipment on shift by shift basis, not just when the patient is being discharged or transferred. Another intervention that should be addressed is how to use correct cleaning and disinfecting products based on the patient’s needs, diagnosis, and the contamination level of the equipment. Another important factor is to consider the type of material that makes up the equipment when selecting a disinfectant solution. With all of these aspects in mind and also the concept to make cleaning of patient care equipment more routine in daily patient care is a critical topic {{that needs to be}} addressed, policies changed, and interventions implemented...|$|R
40|$|Naturally, {{our body}} is created to beactive {{during the day}} light {{and we need to}} rest at night. If the bodys {{biological}} time does not work on normal hours, it will affect the bodys circadian rhythm. The problem on the circadian rhythm could cause health problems, occupational safety, and social aspects. This study aims to determine the circadian rhythms of fishermen who work in Tanjung Emas Semarang. The method of this study is description observational study. The measurement of circadian rhythm used various tools, such as sphygmomanometer for blood <b>pressure,</b> digital <b>thermometer</b> for body temperature, digital sphygmomanometer for pulse and a questionnaire for sleep patterns. The measurement of risk factors of circadian rhythm disorders is also done by using various tools such as a multimeter to measure the noise, temperature and humidity of the environment and a questionnaire to determine the behavior of fishermen. The measurements were taken every two hours for 24 hours, either on land or sea while working. The results showed the risk factors of circadian rhythm disorders are noise, temperature and humidity of the working environment and sleep patterns. Blood pressure and body temperature of fishermen who do not regularly work at night are higher at work than at rest, but there is a difference on fisherman who regularly work at night. Blood pressure and body temperature of fishermen who regularly work at nights are lower while working than at rest. In general, the pulse of fishermen who work at night is higher during work than rest time. Blood pressure and temperature of fisherman who work at daylight and dont sleep at the right tme are higher during work than rest time. Blood pressure and temperature of fishermen who work at daylight and sleep at the right time are lower during work than rest time. The pulse of fishermen who work at daylight and dont sleep at the right time are lower during work than rest time. But the pulsa of fishermen who work at daylight and sleep at the right time are higher during work than rest time. On conclusion, sleep and awakes rhythm od fishermen who work either daylight or night are not normal. Because of that, keeping a sleep pattern, noise, temperature and humadity control of workplace is a very important matter to be done...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article {{examines}} the use of instrumentation amplifiers (IAs) for sensor applications. It highlights system challenges and implementation choices, describes new architectures for integrated-circuit IAs, and outlines applications such as ratiometric bridges and low-side current sensing. A similar article appeared in February 28, 2008 edition of Electronic Design. Sensor measurements typically translate physical phenomena of interest into electronic-circuit parameters such as resistance and capacitance, which can then be read with a bridge circuit. Bridge circuits produce an output voltage or current signal that is ratiometric with respect to temperature and power-supply voltages, thereby enabling the measurement system to selfcompensate for these variables. Sensor examples include: Thermistors for temperature sensing Resistive/capacitive strain gauges for pressure sensing Magneto-resistive sensors for direction/position sensing Sensors that produce a signal voltage or current directly do not require a bridge circuit to transform the physical variables. Examples include thermocouples, ECG-based medical instrumentation, and voltage across the current-sense resistor in a powermonitoring circuit. Today's sensor applications range from consumer electronics (<b>thermometers,</b> <b>pressure</b> scales, GPS systems), to automotive equipment (fuel sensors, knock sensors, brake-line sensors, window pinch control), to industrial and medical instrumentation (valve-position sensing, temperature-based system calibration and alarm, and ECG). Their environments are rich in EMI noise, power-supply harmonics, ground-loop currents, and ESD spikes, while the signals of interest {{that are to be}} extracted are extremely small. Thus, the analog-sensor interface becomes nontrivial, and must maintain exacting specifications while rejecting environmental phenomena. For commercial success, it must also deliver low cost, small size, and (for batteryoperated meters) low supply current...|$|R

Journal of Petrology, 43, 1857 – 1883. ] geothermometer describes olivine liquidus temperature similarly to Ford et al. [Ford, C. E., Russell, D. G., Craven, J. A., Fisk, M. R., 1983.

A comparison of these three geothermometers with experimental data at 0. 1 MPa and 1. 5 GPa reveals that the Ford et al. [Ford, C. E., Russell, D. G., Craven, J. A., Fisk, M. R., 1983.
