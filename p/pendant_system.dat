3000|$|In {{the context}} of this COST Action [...] "systems {{chemistry}} is seen as the joint effort of prebiotic and supramolecular chemistry assisted by computer science from theoretical biology, theoretical chemistry, and complex systems research to tackle dynamic supersystem integration including at least one autocatalytic subsystem. It is the bottom-up <b>pendant</b> of <b>systems</b> biology towards synthetic biology. The origin of life is seen as a major stimulus to organize research but the field is open for chemistries of limited prebiotic plausibility. Subsystems may be classified as genetic, metabolic, or compartment-building. Pairwise integration into higher organized supersystems is expected to yield the knowledge enabling later the triple integration into minimal chemical cells. The integration approach will necessarily link to the question of asymmetric autocatalysis and chiral symmetry breaking, while the key challenge is to find the roots of Darwinian evolvability in chemical systems."

40|$|Progress {{has been}} made {{in each of the three}} project areas during this quarter. Each quarter we are {{highlighting}} one project area. This quarter, Task 2 is highlighted with expanded details. Significant progress {{has been made}} this quarter in testing the functionalities of the foam-durability apparatus for assessment of foam properties at reservoir conditions. Another surfactant, Alipal{reg_sign} CD- 128 at a concentration of 1000 ppm, was used for core flooding experiments. The foam mobility data showed a significant reduction of CO{sub 2 } mobility and a favorable mobility dependence on rock permeability. Two slim tube test series and continuous phase equilibrium were done to examine the effects of pressure, temperature, and oil composition on oil displacement efficiency. A new series of core foam tests were completed to study the effects of flow rate, CO{sub 2 } fraction (foam) quality, and rock permeability on foam-flow behavior. We are in the process of moving the foam reservoir simulator MASTER from a workstation to a Pentium PC environment and test MASTER on a 166 MHz Pentium PC. IFT of CO{sub 2 }/crude oil has been measured using our <b>pendant</b> drop measurement <b>system</b> at 138 {degrees}F and pressures from 850 psig to 2200 psig.
