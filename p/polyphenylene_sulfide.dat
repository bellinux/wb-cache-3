40|$|The miscibilities of <b>poly(phenylene</b> sulfide/poly(phenylene <b>sulfide</b> sulfone) (PPS/PPSS) and <b>poly(phenylene</b> sulfide/poly(phenylene <b>sulfide</b> ether) (PPS/PPSE) blends were {{investigated}} {{in terms of}} shifts of glass transition temperatures T-g of pure PPS, PPSS, and PPSE. The crystallization kinetics of PPS/PPSS blends was also studied {{as a function of}} molar composition. The PPS/PPSS and PPS/PPSE blends are respectively partially and fully miscible. PPSE shows a plasticizing effect on PPS as does PPS on PPSS, which necessarily improves the processibility in the respective systems. We can control T-g and melting temperature T-m of PPS by varying amounts of PPSE in blends. The melt crystallization temperature T-mc of PPS/PPSE blends was higher than that of the PPSE homopolymer. Therefore, these blends require shorter cycle times in processing than pure PPSE. The overall rate of crystallization for PPS/PPSS blends follows the Avrami equation with an exponent similar or equal to 2. The maximal rate of crystallization for PPS/PPSS blends occurs at a temperature higher by 10 degrees C than that for PPS, while the crystallization half time t(1 / 2) is 4 times shorter. In the cold crystallization range, crystal growth rates increase and Avrami exponents decrease significantly as the temperature increasesclose...|$|R
40|$|Fabricating primary {{aircraft}} and spacecraft structures using advanced composite materials entail both benefits and risks. The benefits come from much improved strength-to-weight ratios and stiffness-to-weight ratios, potential for less part count, ability to tailor properties, chemical and solvent resistance, and superior thermal properties. On the other hand, the risks involved include high material costs, lack of processing experience, expensive labor, poor reproducibility, high toxicity for some composites, {{and a variety of}} space induced risks. The purpose of this project is to generate a manufacturing database for a selected number of materials with potential for space applications, and to rely on this database to develop quantitative approaches to screen candidate materials and processes for space applications {{on the basis of their}} manufacturing risks including costs. So far, the following materials have been included in the database: epoxies, polycyanates, bismalemides, PMR- 15, <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>sulfides,</b> polyetherimides, polyetheretherketone, and aluminum lithium. The first four materials are thermoset composites; the next three are thermoplastic composites, and the last one is is a metal. The emphasis of this database is on factors affecting manufacturing such as cost of raw material, handling aspects which include working life and shelf life of resins, process temperature, chemical/solvent resistance, moisture resistance, damage tolerance, toxicity, outgassing, thermal cycling, and void content, nature or type of process, associate tooling, and in-process quality assurance. Based on industry experience and published literature, a relative ranking was established for each of the factors affecting manufacturing as listed above. Potential applications of this database include the determination of a delta cost factor for specific structures with a given process plan and a general methodology to screen materials and processes for incorporation into the current conceptual design optimization of future spacecrafts as being coordinated by the Vehicle Analysis Branch where this research is being conducted...|$|R
