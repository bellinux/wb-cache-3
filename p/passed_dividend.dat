5000|$|Preferred stock can be {{cumulative}} or noncumulative. A cumulative preferred {{requires that}} if a company fails to pay a dividend (or pays less than the stated rate), it must {{make up for it}} at a later time. Dividends accumulate with each <b>passed</b> <b>dividend</b> period (which may be quarterly, semi-annually or annually). When a dividend is not paid in time, it has [...] "passed"; all passed dividends on a cumulative stock make up a dividend in arrears. A stock without this feature is known as a noncumulative, or straight, preferred stock; any dividends passed are lost if not declared.|$|E
25|$|When a security's {{ex-dividend}} date <b>passes,</b> the <b>dividend</b> is {{deducted from}} the shortholder's account and {{paid to the}} person from whom the stock is borrowed.|$|R
60|$|WILDER. Yes, and they'll drop {{to a half}} when we <b>pass</b> {{the next}} <b>dividend.</b>|$|R
60|$|Got them {{squeezed}} out? Oh, yes, easy. There wasn't {{any trouble}} about that. You {{see the old}} man worked up a sort of jolt in wholesale leather on one side, and I fixed up a strike of the hands on the other. We <b>passed</b> the <b>dividend</b> two quarters running, and within a year we had them all scared out and {{the bulk of the}} little shareholders, of course, trooped out after them. They always do. The old man picked up the stock when they dropped it, and one-half of it he handed over to me.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} link between the {{accuracy}} of consensus analysts' dividend forecasts, earnings predictability and dividend policies of firms in 39 countries from 1995 to 2004. For firms that display stronger dividend smoothing, as modeled by Lintner [Lintner, J., 1956. Distribution of incomes of corporations among dividends, retained earnings and taxes. American Economic Review 46, 97 - 113], there is a lower correlation between dividend and earnings forecast errors, with less of the earnings uncertainty being <b>passed</b> into <b>dividend</b> uncertainty. The link between earnings and dividend forecast errors is weaker in common-law, capital market-based countries and in countries with well-developed financial (debt and equity) markets, where firm managers have greater incentives to smooth dividends and to use dividends for signaling. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1993 and 1994, Marvel's holding companies—Marvel Holdings, Inc. and Marvel Parent Holdings, Inc.—were formed between Andrews Group and MEG {{and issued}} {{over half a}} billion dollars in bonds under the {{direction}} of Perelman, secured by Marvel's rising stock, which was <b>passed</b> up in <b>dividends</b> to Perlman's group of companies. Marvel continued making acquisitions with Panini, an Italian sticker-maker on August 4, 1994 for $158.4 million, and SkyBox International on March 8, 1995 for $150 million.|$|R
50|$|The {{flotation}} {{was closely}} followed by recession and in 1975 Countryside <b>passed</b> its final <b>dividend.</b> Bobroff had resigned in 1974, {{and the subsequent}} expansion was under the sole direction of Alan Cherry. He emphasised the importance of design and marketing and took the Company {{into a series of}} very large sites, e.g. Chelmer Village and Chatham Maritime. In 2005, Alan Cherry sought to take the company private. A prominent investor, Paul Kemsley and Joe Lewis's Rock Properties, increased its stake to 28.5%, forcing Cherry to pay more for the company. Countryside was bought out by Copthorn Holdings Ltd, which was then jointly owned by the Cherry family and the Bank of Scotland, part of Lloyds Banking Group.|$|R
50|$|Markelov's tyre {{management}} paid <b>dividends,</b> <b>passing</b> Nato {{and closing}} rapidly on Leclerc as the pitstops {{started to come}} into effect. On lap 14, Nato pitted for soft tyres and used the fresh rubber {{to close the gap}} to Leclerc, who pitted one lap later. Almost immediately after exiting the pits, Leclerc came under attack from Nato, with the latter taking the lead around the outside of turn four. Markelov then pitted for new tyres, but by now, the gap was extensive and victory seemed unlikely. However, when the race when into the final stages, Leclerc and Nato's pace fell by the wayside, whilst Markelov maintained a strong pace. Markelov passed Leclerc coming out of the final corner on lap 29 and closed on Nato to overtake him as well.|$|R
60|$|The {{anomalous}} relation he {{held to the}} Northwicks afforded him so much {{excitement and}} enjoyment, that he <b>passed</b> his devil's <b>dividend,</b> as he called his quarterly spree. He kept straight longer than his fellow citizens had known him to do for many years. But Putney {{was one of those}} men who could not be credited by people generally with the highest motives. He too often made a mock of what people generally regarded as the highest motives; he puzzled and affronted them; and as none of his most intimate friends could claim that he was respectable in the ordinary sense of the word, people generally attributed interested motives, or at least cynical motives, to him. Adeline Northwick profited by a call she made upon Dr. Morrell for advice about her dyspepsia, to sound him in regard to Putney's management of her affairs; and if the doctor's powders had not so distinctly done her good, she might {{not have been able to}} rely upon the assurance he gave her, that Putney was acting wisely and most disinterestedly toward her and her sister.|$|R
