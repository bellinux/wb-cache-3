50|$|In Gross. By contrast, a <b>profit</b> <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> can be {{assigned}} or otherwise transferred by its owner. Courts will construe a profit as being in gross unless the profit is expressly designated as being appurtenant. Therefore, profits by prescription will virtually always be profits in gross. Like a commercial easement in gross, a <b>profit</b> <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> is completely alienable. Profits can also be exclusive (guaranteeing {{the owner of the}} profit that no other person will be given the right to collect the specified resources on the land).|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} an {{interest}} 2 ̆ 2 running 2 ̆ 2 with particular realty is employed in connection with assignments of easements and profits to develop rules which are reasonably clear and free from dispute in most situations. The burden, on the servient land passes with such land to all takers thereof. In theory {{this end of the}} easement or profit runs with the servient tenement itself, rather than merely with an estate therein, and hence is binding upon even adverse possessors of the freehold. The benefit of an easement appurtenant to some dominant tenement passes freely therewith even without separate mention. The benefit of a profit appurtenant passes in similar fashion. The only limitation is that the servient land must not be 2 ̆ 2 surcharged, 2 ̆ 2 or unduly burdened, by certain transfers as described below. s The benefit of a <b>profit</b> <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> is freely assignable from one person to another, subject only to the rule that where assigned to more than one the new takers must 2 ̆ 2 work together with one stock 2 ̆ 2 that is, in common as one person. But when we come to easements in gross, a serious difference of opinion exists on the question {{whether or not they are}} transferable. A large portion of this essay will be devoted to a consideration of this particular problem...|$|E

40|$|Market {{infrastructure}} {{formation of}} national economy requires {{a change in}} production orientation and sales channels, in particular, to ensure its quality and safety. Under the conditions of a saturated market and increased competition {{to improve the quality}} of products and reduce manufacturing defects should be one of the main tasks of the enterprise management system. Research of specifics of the forest enterprises allowed to specify the technological aspects of internal accounting organization and develop a standard form of the manufacturing defect act, which makes it possible to identify the perpetrators of poorly manufactured products in various stages of production and transportation of products. Reduction of manufacturing defects causes an increase in the proportion of usable finished products, contributes to an increase <b>in</b> <b>profit,</b> <b>gross</b> income and profitability. The article also provides recommendations for development of the scale, which summarizes the technological features of the timber processing and reflects wage, depending on the cause of manufacturing defect that isn’t a fault of the employee...|$|R

30|$|The MRR {{analysis}} showed that the treatment with P fertilizer {{at the rate of}} 30  kg P 2 O 5 ha− 1 gave MRR of 67.8  %. It is worthwhile to note that the basal N and K fertilizers applied to all plots in this experiment might have diminished the yield variations among treatments that eventually reduced the variations <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> income. This suggests that phosphorus application at the rate of 30  kg P 2 O 5 ha− 1 could be enough for optimum yield and maximum <b>profit</b> <b>in</b> conditions of sufficient nitrogen and potassium fertilizers were applied.|$|R

30|$|In section IV, we {{analyze the}} decline <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> worker flows (hires and separations), {{employing}} some helpful identities that relate gross worker flows to gross job flows (job creation and job destruction), {{as well as}} to job-to-job flows. We find that the decline <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> job flows can be described as a narrowing of the distribution of employer growth rates, but this change in the distribution of gross job flows only explains {{about a third of the}} decline <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> worker flows. This implies that whatever economic forces are driving the declines <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> job flows, there are different forces that are driving the declines <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> worker flows. Analyzing the relationship between gross worker flows and job-to-job flows, we find that declines in both short-duration jobs and job-to-job flows are driving the declines <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> worker flows.|$|R
40|$|The 2014 Annual Economic Report (AER) on the European Union (EU) {{fishing fleet}} {{provides}} a comprehensive {{overview of the}} latest information available on the structure and economic performance of EU Member States fishing fleets. The results show that although revenue (income from seafood sales plus other income from non-fishing activities) generated by the fleet decreased compared to 2011, costs decreased even more, making the EU fishing fleet generally profitable and {{more so than in}} 2011. The decrease in revenue is consistent with a decrease in the total weight and value of seafood landed by the EU fleet. In 2012, the EU fleet generated € 6. 9 billion in revenue, amounting to € 3. 3 billion <b>in</b> <b>Gross</b> Value Added, € 1. 3 billion <b>in</b> <b>gross</b> <b>profit</b> and € 458 million <b>in</b> net <b>profit.</b> <b>In</b> 2012, 6. 6 % of the fleet’s revenue was retained as net <b>profit.</b> <b>In</b> view of the continued uncertain economic climate in many Member States and high fuel prices, the economic performance of the EU fleet in the near future is unclear. Projections for 2013 suggest decreased revenue for nine out of 15 Member State fleets assessed. However, GVA as a proportion of revenue is expected to have increased or remained stable in 9 out of the 15 MS fleets, and gross profit and net profit margins are expected to have increased in about half of the fleets assessed. This year’s publication includes: (1) an extended (non-technical) summary; (2) a structural and economic overview of the EU fishing fleet; (3) a detailed economic and structural overview of the fishing fleets from each EU Member State; (4) qualitative economic performance assessments for 2012 and performance projections for 2013 for each EU Member State; and (5) regional analyses of the EU fishing fleet.

40|$|There are {{two methods}} of {{accounting}} for inventories {{that can be used}} by companies according to accounting standards and tax regulations in Indonesia, i. e. first-in, first out (FIFO) and average. The use of different inventory accounting methods would result in the difference of the value of ending inventory, cost of goods sold, and net income. This research analyzes whether there is a difference in the earnings growth and market value of companies using the FIFO and average. This research uses data of manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) in 2009 - 2010 with samples 13 companies using FIFO method and 67 companies using average method.
