30|$|Self-owned {{power plant}} {{is also an}} {{important}} factor affecting renewable energy accommodation. Owing to relatively fixed load, self-owned power plant seldom participates in system peak shaving, and <b>public</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> and renewable energy plant are forced to participate in peak shaving. At present, installed capacity of self-owned power plants in “three north” area accounts for 13 % of installed capacity of thermal power plants, and there are 6 provinces or autonomous regions where installed capacity of self-owned power plants accounts for more than 10 % of total installed capacity of thermal power. It is very disadvantageous to reduce grid minimum technical output and enhance renewable energy accommodation capacity.|$|E
40|$|This study explores {{whether the}} European Union’s CO 2 Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) could provide {{incentives}} for the <b>public</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> responsible for {{about one third}} of EU- 27 CO 2 emissions, to improve their environmental and productive performance. The existing ex post literature only partially addresses this issue- productive performance is measured partially, or environmental performance is neglected. This paper develops an approach for measuring the overall impact of the EU ETS on the <b>public</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> of the EU member states during 1996 - 2007. Firstly, it measures environmental efficiency and total factor productivity growth taking into account environmental variables. For this purpose, Data Envelopment Analysis is used as the principle methodological base. Secondly, {{the impact of the}} EU ETS, fossil fuel prices and other variables on the environmental efficiency and productivity indicators are estimated by using econometric techniques. Two findings emerge from this analysis: i) the EU ETS had a positive effect on the environmental efficiency and technical change of the <b>public</b> <b>power</b> plants; however, ii) the looseness of this policy reflected in the overallocation of the grandfathered permits led to the deteriorating performance. ...|$|R
25|$|Prior to 1991, the {{electricity}} sector in Argentina was vertically integrated. The sector experienced a serious {{crisis in the}} summers of 1988/1989, primarily {{due to the lack}} of maintenance of the country's thermal <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> (50% were unavailable). Shortly after the crisis, the government of Carlos Menem introduced a new legal framework for {{the electricity}} sector through Law 24,065, which included the following elements: vertical and horizontal unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution; opening up of all segments to the private sector; and separation of the regulatory function from policy setting. As a result of the new law, there was substantial private investment which, together with the <b>public</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> that started production in the 1990s, transformed a situation of power shortage and low quality into one of abundance and reliability at lower prices.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} the impact of management development programs on nuclear managers at the Omaha <b>Public</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Plant</b> in Fort Calhoun, Nebraska. The subjects of this study were managers who had attended management development programs over the past three years. Management development programs (MDP 2 ̆ 7 s) serve as a training field for preparing managers for future jobs within organizations. MDP 2 ̆ 7 s prepare, educate, inform and refine managers so that they are more effective in their organization. These programs contribute to the ongoing success of the managers and ultimately the organization. One of the main factors that contributes to the success of MDP 2 ̆ 7 s is that they are based on andragogy. Malcolm Knowles, the father of adult education, defines andragogy as the art and science of teaching adults. One organization, the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD), located in Omaha, Nebraska, has implemented management development programs using adult education principles for managers in its nuclear power plant at Fort Calhoun. OPPD began offering management development programs to its nuclear plant managers in 1988. Yet, to date, there has been no evaluation of the effectiveness of these programs on nuclear personnel. To remedy this shortcoming, this study provides an evaluation of the effectiveness of MDP 2 ̆ 7 s by gathering qualitative interview data from personnel who work in the nuclear organization. ...|$|E

40|$|The Greek {{energy policy}} is orientated towards the {{coverage}} of the electricity requirements by the combustion of solid fuels (lignite), which results in the production of high amounts of byproducts. The most important byproduct (13 x 106 t/y) of the lignite thermal decomposition is the fly ash, a fine material, which is collected in the electrostatic filters of the <b>Public</b> <b>Power</b> Corporation <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> in Megalopoli (Peloponnese) and Ptolemais (West Macedonia). The objective of the present thesis is the utilization of Megalopoli’s fly ash in construction materials production, not only as pozzolanic additive (up to 10 %) but also as a raw material with addition up to 30 %. This perspective is of significant economical benefits because of the lower production cost of the building materials, due to the utilization of cheaper raw material (fly ash) and energy savings (grinding, firing), since fly ash is added in the last stage of the cement production process. The investigation initially consists of the separate study of the two materials, Portland cement and Megalopoli’s fly ash, which comprise the components of the proposed mixtures (fly ash -cements). ...|$|R
