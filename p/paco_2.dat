40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{significance}} {{of changes in}} <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> during long-term noninvasive ventilation(NIV) on prognosis remains unclear. We aimed to clarify whether stabilizing <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> during NIV had a favorable prognostic effect. METHODS: Data from 190 subjects with restrictive thoracic disease and who received long-term NIV were studied retrospectively. The annual change in <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> during NIV was determined using a simple linear regression method for each subject who had at least 4 6 -month intervals of <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> data. Annual changes in <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> during long-term NIV and possible confounders were analyzed with discontinuation of long-term NIV as the main outcome. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-five subjects who had> 4 6 -month intervals of <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> data {{were included in the}} study. <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> during long-term NIV decreased in 41 subjects (group 1; 1. 85 mm Hg/y). Smaller annual changes in <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> (P<. 001) and a control ventilator mode (P. 008) were associated with a significantly higher probability of continuing NIV, compared with decreased <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> 3 – 6 months after the start of long-term NIV (P. 11). The 10 -y probability of continuing NIV was 69 % in group 1, 39 % in group 2, and 12 % in group 3. CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in the annual change of <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> during long-term NIV was shown to be a significantly prognostically favorable factor. Efforts to reduce <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> should be made if <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> increases at a greater rate during long-term NIV.

MethodsData on 184 post-tuberculosis patients with chronic restrictive ventilatory failure who were receiving long-term domiciliary NPPV were examined retrospectively. Average <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> 3 – 6 months after NPPV (3 - to 6 -mo <b>PaCO</b> <b>2)</b> and potential confounders were analyzed with discontinuation of long-term NPPV as the primary outcome. The effects of 3 - to 6 -mo <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> on annual hospitalization rates due to respiratory deterioration from 1 year before to 3 years after the initiation of NPPV were examined. The effect of the difference between the <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> value at the start of NPPV (0 -mo <b>PaCO</b> <b>2)</b> and the <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> value 3 - to 6 -mo later (d-PaCO 2) on continuation rates for NPPV was also assessed in patients who initiated NPPV while in a chronic state.

30|$|We {{acknowledge}} {{that this study}} has important limitations to consider. First, we found prescribed MV to have only a weak correlation with initial post-resuscitation <b>PaCO</b> <b>2,</b> suggesting <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> is also influenced by patient-related factors; however, although this was a registry study of prospectively collected <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> analyses and ventilator settings, patient-related factors were not initially collected and thus {{we were unable to}} determine what other factors were associated with initial post-resuscitation <b>PaCO</b> <b>2.</b> Many potentially important other factors are not routinely recorded in the patient record (for example, duration and technique of bag ventilation by hand prior to initiation of mechanical ventilation, lung compliance, lung injury, intrinsic respiratory drive, persistent post-resuscitation circulatory shock, dead space) and thus rigorous prospective research is required to determine the other determinates of initial post-resuscitation <b>PaCO</b> <b>2.</b> Second, this was an observational study and there exists the potential of unmeasured confounders (for example post-resuscitation lactic acidosis). Third, this study was limited to one center and it is possible that a study of larger scope could have found different results. Fourth, we defined hypocapnia and hypercapnia as <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> [*]≤[*] 30 mmHg and <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> [*]≥[*] 50 mmHg, respectively, based on <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> levels from previously published studies [5, 6, 23]. We did not find a narrower <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> range to be associated good neurological outcome suggesting severe <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> derangements may be more detrimental to neurological outcome than smaller <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> derangements; however, exact <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> levels associated with good neurological outcome are unknown. Fifth, we did not perform any monitoring of physiological parameters related to <b>PaCO</b> <b>2,</b> such as transcranial Doppler monitoring. Sixth, {{it is important to consider}} that the majority of the patients in this study were in-hospital and PEA/asystole cardiac arrests, and these patients are known to have an exceptionally poor prognosis for survival. Lastly, this was an observational study and thus we can only report an association between normocapnia and good neurological outcome, rather than infer causation.|$|E

40|$|SummaryAimTranscutaneous {{carbon dioxide}} (PtCO 2) {{monitoring}} offers a potentially non-invasive and continuous means {{to determine the}} arterial carbon dioxide tension (<b>PaCO</b> <b>2).</b> ED studies of agreement between PtCO 2 and <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> have had conflicting findings and have not been targeted to subgroups with severe ventilatory disturbance such as those requiring non-invasive ventilation [NIV]. Our aim is to determine agreement between PtCO 2 and <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> for patients undergoing NIV for respiratory failure. MethodsThis prospective observational study included {{a convenience sample of}} patients undergoing NIV for respiratory failure who required arterial blood gas analysis as part of their care. Data collected included patient demographics, indication for NIV, diagnosis, vital signs, and pH, <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> and PtCO 2. The outcome of interest was agreement between <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> and PtCO 2. Analysis was made using descriptive statistics, Bland-Altman techniques, Mann–Whitney U test and Fisher/Chi square tests. Results 46 comparisons were analysed. Median age was 69 [IQR 65 – 79], 67 % male; median <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> 60  mmHg [IQR 46 – 70] and median pH 7. 35 [IQR 7. 30 – 7. 38]. Average difference between <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> and PtCO 2 was 6. 1  mmHg with 95 % limits of agreement − 10. 1 – 22. 3  mmHg. Thirty seven comparisons [80 %] were within 10  mmHg [95 % CI 66 – 90 %]. Difference > 10  mmHg was associated with increasing <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> [p =  0. 001; median difference 19. 6  mmHg, 95 % CI 9. 2 – 30. 4  mmHg]. All cases with difference > 10  mmHg had <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b>  >  60  mmHg.

We have tested the hypothesis that end-tidal PCO 2 may be used to test the HCVR in COPD during non-steady-state rebreathing, despite the fact that large (arterial–end-tidal) PCO 2 differences (P(a–et) CO 2) exist during air breathing. MethodsEight patients and 11 healthy volunteers underwent steady-state HCVR testing and non-steady-state rebreathing HCVR testing, using Pa and PetCO 2. ResultsIn COPD patients, PetCO 2 was lower than <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> by a constant amount throughout steady-state HCVR, but equalised with <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> during non-steady-state HCVR. Consequently there were no differences in HCVR slope using either method (steady-state p= 0. 91; rebreathing p= 0. 73), or HCVR intercept in rebreathing (p= 0. 68) whether <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> or PetCO 2 was used. The steady-state HCVR intercept using PetCO 2 was greater than that using <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> (p= 0. 02). In healthy volunteers PetCO 2 equalised with <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> during steady-state HCVR, but was progressively greater than <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> during non-steady-state. Consequently, {{there was no difference in}} HCVR slope (p= 0. 21) or intercept (p= 0. 46) whether <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> or PetCO 2 was used.

METHODS: Forty-seven men with COPD underwent both pulmonary function testing and incremental exercise testing until limited by symptoms. Arterial blood gases and exercise physiological measurements were performed during maximal exercise testing. The prediction equations for <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> were gener-ated using regression techniques with the leave-one-out cross-validation technique. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were included in the final analysis after 6 patients were excluded due to inad-equate data collection. The best prediction equation we found was: predicted <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> 23. 71 PETCO 2 (0. 9 – 0. 01 DLCO – 0. 04 VT) – 2. 61 SVC – 0. 04 MEP, where DLCO is diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide in mL/min/mm Hg, VT is tidal volume in L, SVC is slow vital capacity in L, and MEP is maximum expiratory pressure in cm H 2 O. The difference between the measured and predicted <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> at each time point was not statistically significant (all P>. 05). The standard errors of the estimated <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> at each time point were 0. 91 – 1. 12 mm Hg.

This study was performed to compare the accuracy of the noninvasive monitoring of PCO 2 using transcutaneous CO 2 (TC-CO 2) with ET-CO 2 in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) during OLV. Materials and Methods: In adult patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgical procedures, PCO 2 was simultaneously measured with TC-CO 2 and ET-CO 2 devices and compared with <b>PaCO</b> <b>2.</b> Results: The cohort for the study included 15 patients ranging in age from 19 to 71 years and in weight from 76 to 126 kg. During TLV, the difference between the TC-CO 2 and the <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> was 3. 0 &#x 00 B 1; 1. 8 mmHg and the difference between the ET-CO 2 and <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> was 6. 2 &#x 00 B 1; 4. 7 mmHg (P = 0. 02). Linear regression analysis of TC-CO 2 vs. <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> resulted in an r 2 = 0. 6280 and a slope = 0. 7650 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 1428, while linear regression analysis of ET-CO 2 vs. <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> resulted in an r 2 = 0. 05528 and a slope = 0. 1986 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 1883. During OLV, the difference between the TC-CO 2 and <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> was 3. 5 &#x 00 B 1; 1. 7 mmHg and the ET-CO 2 to <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> difference was 9. 6 &#x 00 B 1; 3. 6 mmHg (P = 0. 03 vs. ET-CO 2 to <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> difference during TLV; and P &# 60; 0. 0001 vs. TC-CO 2 to <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> difference during OLV). In 13 of the 15 patients, the TC-CO 2 value was closer to the actual <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> than the ET-CO 2 value (P = 0. 0001). Linear regression analysis of TC-CO 2 vs. <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> resulted in an r 2 = 0. 7827 and a slope = 0. 8142 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 0. 07965, while linear regression analysis of ET-CO 2 vs. <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> resulted in an r 2 = 0. 2989 and a slope = 0. 3026 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 08605. Conclusions: During OLV, TC-CO 2 monitoring provides a better estimate of <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> than ET-CO 2 in patients undergoing VATS...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{relationship}} between end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO 2) and arterial carbon dioxide (<b>PaCO</b> <b>2)</b> if better defined could facilitate the {{difficult task of}} ventilation in prehospital trauma patients. We aimed to study the <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> -EtCO 2 relationship before, during, and after chest trauma, hemorrhage, and resuscitation in swine. Twenty-four swine were intubated, anesthetized, and monitored in an animal intensive care unit during three phases: phase 1 (day 1, healthy animals); phase 2 (day 2, injury), which consisted of blunt chest trauma, hemorrhage, and resuscitation; and phase 3 (day 2, after injury). ‘‘Respiratory maneuvers’ ’ (changes in respiratory rate and tidal volume [TV], intended to vary the <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> over a range of 25 to 85 mmHg, were performed during phases 1 and 3. End-tidal CO 2 and <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> were recorded after each respiratory man-euver and analyzed using linear regression. During phase 1, <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> and EtCO 2 were strongly correlated (r 2 0. 97, P G 0. 01). During phase 2, animals developed decreased oxygenation (PaO 2 :FiO 2 [fraction of inspired oxygen] ratio G 200) and hy-potension (mean arterial pressure, 20 50 mmHg); the <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> -EtCO 2 relationship deteriorated (r 2 0. 25, P G 0. 0001).

40|$|To {{investigate}} the correlation {{and accuracy of}} transcutaneous carbon dioxide partial pressure (PTCCO 2) with regard to arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (<b>PaCO</b> <b>2)</b> in severe obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Twenty-one patients with BMI. 35 kg/m 2 were enrolled in our study. Their <b>PaCO</b> <b>2,</b> end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (PetCO 2), as well as PTCCO 2 values were measured at before pneumoperitoneum and 30 min, 60 min, 120 min after pneumoperitoneum respectively. Then the differences between each pair of values (PetCO 2 –PaCO 2) and. (PTCCO 2 –PaCO 2) were calculated. Bland–Altman method, correlation and regression analysis, as well as exact probability method and two way contingency table were employed for the data analysis. 21 adults (aged 19 – 54 yr, mean 29, SD 9 yr; weight 86 – 160 kg, mean 119. 3, SD 22. 1 kg; BMI 35. 3 – 51. 1 kg/m 2, mean 42. 1,SD 5. 4 kg/m 2) were finally included in this study. One patient was eliminated due {{to the use of}} vaso-excitor material phenylephrine during anesthesia induction. Eighty-four sample sets were obtained. The average <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> –PTCCO 2 difference was 0. 961. 3 mmHg (mean 6 SD). And the average <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> –PetCO 2 difference was 10. 362. 3 mmHg (mean 6 SD). The linear regression equation of <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> –PetCO 2 is PetCO 2 = 11. 58 + 0. 576 <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> (r 2 = 0. 64, P, 0. 01), whereas the one of <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> –PTCCO 2 is PTCCO 2 = 0. 60 + 0. 976 <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> (r 2 = 0. 89). The LOA (limits of agreement) of 95 % average <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> –PetCO 2 difference is 10. 364. 6 mmHg (mean 61. 96 SD), while the LOA of 95 % average <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> –PTCCO 2 difference is 0. 962. 6 mmHg (mean 61. 96 SD).

40|$|Background/Aim. Oxygen {{therapy is}} a {{necessary}} therapeutic method in treatment of severe chronic respiratory failure (CRF), especially in phases of acute worsening. Risks which are {{to be taken into}} consideration during this therapy are: unpredictable increase of carbon dioxide in blood, carbonarcosis, respiratory acidosis and coma. The aim {{of this study was to}} show the influence of oxygen therapy on changes of arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressure. Methods. The study included 93 patients in 104 admittances to the hospital due to acute exacerbation of CFR. The majority of the patients (89. 4 %) had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), while other causes of respiratory failure were less common. The effect of oxygenation was controlled through measurement of PaO 2 and <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> in arterial blood samples. To analyze the influence of oxygen therapy on levels of carbon dioxide, greatest values of change of PaO 2 and <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> values from these measurements, including corresponding PaO 2 values from the same blood analysis were taken. Results. The obtained results show that oxygen therapy led to the increase of PaO 2 but also to the increase of <b>PaCO</b> <b>2.</b> The average increase of PaO 2 for the whole group of patients was 2. 42 kPa, and the average increase of <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> was 1. 69 kPa. There was no correlation between the initial values of PaO 2 and <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> and changes of <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> during the oxygen therapy. Also, no correlation between the produced increase in PaO 2 and change in <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> during this therapy was found. Conclusion. Controlled oxygen therapy in patients with severe respiratory failure greatly reduces the risk of unwanted increase of <b>PaCO</b> <b>2,</b> but does not exclude it completely. The initial values of PaO 2 and <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> are not reliable parameters which could predict the response to oxygen therapy...|$|E
40|$|End-tidal {{carbon dioxide}} tension (PetCO 2) is reduced during an orthostatic challenge, during heat stress, and during a {{combination}} of these two conditions. The importance of these changes is dependent on PetCO 2 being an accurate surrogate for arterial carbon dioxide tension (<b>PaCO</b> <b>2),</b> the latter being the physiologically relevant variable. This study tested the hypothesis that PetCO 2 provides an accurate assessment of <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> during the aforementioned conditions. Comparisons between these measures were made: 1) after two levels of heat stress (N = 11); 2) during combined heat stress and simulated hemorrhage [via lower-body negative pressure (LBNP), N = 8]; and 3) during an end-tidal clamping protocol to attenuate heat stress-induced reductions in PetCO 2 (N = 7). PetCO 2 and <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> decreased during heat stress (P < 0. 001); however, there was no group difference between <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> and PetCO 2 (P = 0. 36) nor was there a significant interaction between thermal condition and measurement technique (P = 0. 06). To verify that this nonsignificant trend for the interaction was not due to a type II error, PetCO 2 and <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> at three distinct thermal conditions were also compared using paired t-tests, revealing no difference between <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> and PetCO 2 while normothermic (P = 0. 14) and following a 1. 0 ± 0. 2 °C (P = 0. 21) and 1. 4 ± 0. 2 °C (P = 0. 28) increase in internal temperature. During LBNP while heat stressed, measures of PetCO 2 and <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> were similar (P = 0. 61). Likewise, during the end-tidal carbon dioxide clamping protocol, the increases in PetCO 2 (7. 5 ± 2. 8 mmHg) and <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> (6. 6 ± 3. 4 mmHg) were similar (P = 0. 31). These data indicate that mean PetCO 2 reflects mean <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> during the evaluated conditions...|$|E
40|$|In the normocapnic range, middle {{cerebral}} artery mean velocity (MCA Vmean) changes approximately 3. 5 % per mmHg carbon-dioxide tension in arterial blood (<b>PaCO</b> <b>2)</b> and {{a decrease in}} <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> will reduce the cerebral blood flow by vasoconstriction (the CO 2 reactivity of the brain). When standing up MCA Vmean and the end-tidal carbon-dioxide tension (PETCO 2) decrease, suggesting that <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> contributes to the reduction in MCA Vmean. In a fixed body position, PETCO 2 tracks changes in the <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> but when assuming the upright position, cardiac output (Q) decreases and its distribution over the lung changes, while ventilation (VE) increases suggesting that PETCO 2 decreases more than <b>PaCO</b> <b>2.</b> This study evaluated whether the postural reduction in <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> accounts for the postural decline in MCA Vmean). From the supine to the upright position, VE, Q, PETCO 2, <b>PaCO</b> <b>2,</b> MCA Vmean, and the near-infrared spectrophotometry determined cerebral tissue oxygenation (CO 2 Hb) were followed in seven subjects. When standing up, MCA Vmean (from 65. 3 +/- 3. 8 to 54. 6 +/- 3. 3 cm s(- 1); mean +/- SEM; P < 0. 05) and cO 2 Hb (- 7. 2 +/- 2. 2 micromol l(- 1); P < 0. 05) decreased. At the same time, the VE/Q ratio increased 49 +/- 14 % (P < 0. 05) with the postural reduction in PETCO 2 overestimating the decline in <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> (- 4. 8 +/- 0. 9 mmHg vs. - 3. 0 +/- 1. 1 mmHg; P < 0. 05). When assuming the upright position, the postural decrease in MCA Vmean seems to be explained by the reduction in PETCO 2 but the small decrease in <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> makes it unlikely that the postural decrease in MCA Vmean can be accounted for by the cerebral CO 2 reactivity alon...|$|E
40|$|Background: To date, an {{important}} aspect that has still not been clarified is the assessment of OHS severity. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate whether grading OHS severity according to <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> values {{may be useful in}} order to provide a more definite characterization and targeted management of patients. In this regard, baseline anthropometric and sleep polygraphic characteristics, treatment options, and follow up outcomes, were compared between OHS patients with different degree of severity (as assessed according to <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> values). Methods: Patients were classified into three groups, according to <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> values: 1) mild (46 mmHg ≤ <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> ≤ 50 mmHg), moderate (51 mmHg ≤ <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> ≤ 55 mmHg), severe (<b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> ≥ 56 mmHg). Therefore, differences among the groups in terms of baseline anthropometric, and sleep polygraphic characteristics, treatment modalities and follow up outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. Results: Patients with more severe degree of hypercapnia were assessed to have increased BMI and bicarbonate levels, worse diurnal and nocturnal hypoxemia, and a more severe impairment in pulmonary mechanics compared to milder OHS. CPAP responders rate significantly decreased from mild to severe OHS. After follow up, daytime sleepiness (as measure by the ESS), PaO 2, and <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> significantly improved with PAP therapy in all three groups. Discussion and Conclusions: Classification of OHS severity according to <b>PaCO</b> <b>2</b> levels may be useful to provide a more defined characterization and, consequently, a more targeted management of OHS patients. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings...|$|E
