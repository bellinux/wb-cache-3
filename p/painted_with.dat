He <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> the usual pigments of his period such as azurite, lead-tin-yellow, vermilion, madder lake, ochres and red lead, but he seldom used the expensive natural ultramarine.|$|E
5|$|Log coffins {{are made}} from trees that have been {{naturally}} hollowed out by termites. They are cut, cleaned and then <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> natural pigments during a ceremonial camp.

50|$|Fat over lean {{refers to}} the {{principle}} in oil painting of applying <b>paint</b> <b>with</b> a higher oil to pigment ratio ('fat') over <b>paint</b> <b>with</b> a lower oil to pigment ratio ('lean') to ensure a stable paint film, since {{it is believed that}} the <b>paint</b> <b>with</b> the higher oil content remains more flexible.|$|R

5|$|A great {{portion of}} the mosque is covered with whitewash, but the drum of the dome and the walls {{immediately}} beneath it are decorated with mosaics and marble. Some paintings by an Italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in 1927. The ceiling of the mosque was <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> funding by King Farouk of Egypt.|$|E

Unpainted black stone images of the Aravan-head are seen in Kothattai, Madhukarai and Pillaiyarkuppam.|$|E
5|$|As the Khmer Rouge had no {{air force}} and only limited {{anti-aircraft}} capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but the evacuation was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was suspected that the Khmer Rouge might possess SA-7 shoulder-launched surface to air missiles and so the evacuation helicopters were <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> infra-red low-reflective paint and equipped with ALE-29 flare dispensers.|$|E

5|$|During its operation, Virgin Atlantic Little Red's fleet {{consisted}} of four Airbus A320s wet leased from Aer Lingus under a three-year contract. The aircraft had 29 rows of seating with a 3–3 configuration, {{for a total}} of 174 seats. The fleet was <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> Virgin Atlantic livery with future plans to eventually repaint them with Little Red livery. However, due to the closure of operations, this rebrand of the planes never occurred and they retained their original livery.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the {{lighthouse}} underwent major repairs for its anniversary. As {{part of those}} renovations, the tower was <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> high quality oil paint, which became the main contributor to {{the deterioration of the}} tower in subsequent decades– thick waterproof layers of paint did not allow the limestone to dry. The mortar began to deteriorate rapidly.|$|E
5|$|JAL is {{also known}} for its liveries {{featuring}} Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, {{as it is the}} official airline of the Tokyo Disney Resort. They sponsor the attraction Star Jets (not related to past Star Jets fleet with the old tsurumaru livery), which feature a variation of the current livery on the ride vehicles.

5|$|Marigene Butler, head {{conservator}} at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, oversaw a multi-national {{research project}} between 1983 and 1989. Her team investigated the provenance {{of the two}} paintings and relationships between them through technical analyses. At that time both paintings underwent further restorations. They examined the wooden supports, parchment fibres and priming layers of the Philadelphia painting. A sample of paint {{was taken from the}} seraph-Christ's wings; analysis found particles of pure ultramarine, the most expensive pigment at the time. The team identified red organic lake in the stigmata wounds, and vermilion and lead white on Francis's cheeks. Infrared reflectography found a base layer of paint overlaid with hatching and fine brush strokes on an additional layer. The greenery was <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> a copper resinate that over time has darkened to brown. The mountains and sky were <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> ultramarine and lead white. Compared to the Turin painting, the Philadelphia version shows little evidence of underdrawing.|$|E
5|$|The B-52C's fuel {{capacity}} (and range) was increased to 41,700USgallons by adding larger 3000USgallon underwing fuel tanks. The gross weight was increased by 30,000pounds (13,605kg) to 450,000pounds. A new fire control system, the MD-9, was introduced on this model. The {{belly of the}} aircraft was <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> antiflash white paint, which was intended to reflect thermal radiation away after a nuclear detonation.|$|E
5|$|The female half has karanda-mukuta (a basket-shaped crown) on {{her head}} or well-combed knotted hair or both. The left ear wears a valika-kundala (a type of earring). A tilaka or bindu (a round red dot) adorns her forehead, {{matching}} Shiva's third eye. The left eye is <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> black eyeliner. While the male neck is sometimes adorned with a jewelled hooded serpent, the female neck has a blue lotus matching it.|$|E

5|$|The two Sydney punchbowls are {{the only}} known {{examples}} of Chinese export porcelain hand <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> Sydney scenes and dating from the Macquarie era, lasting 1810–1821. The bowls were procured in China sometime between 1796 and 1820; about three decades after the First Fleet's arrival at Port Jackson in Sydney Cove. By 1850 Chinese-made porcelain imports had been replaced with British earthenwares transfer-printed with decoration of Chinese derivation.|$|E
5|$|Al-Aqsa's dome {{is one of}} the few domes to be {{built in}} front of the mihrab during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods, the others being the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus (715) and the Great Mosque of Sousse (850). The {{interior}} of the dome is <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> 14th-century-era decorations. During the 1969 burning, the paintings were assumed to be irreparably lost, but were completely reconstructed using the trateggio technique, a method that uses fine vertical lines to distinguish reconstructed areas from original ones.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as smooth as possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.|$|E
5|$|Burial 48 is {{generally}} accepted as {{the tomb of}} Siyaj Chan K'awil. It is located beneath Temple 33 in the North Acropolis. The chamber of the tomb was cut from the bedrock and contained {{the remains of the}} king himself together with those of two adolescents who had been sacrificed in order to accompany the deceased ruler. The walls of the tomb were covered with white stucco <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> hieroglyphs that included the Long Count date equivalent to 20 March 457, probably the date of either the death or interment of the king. The king's skeleton was missing its skull, its femurs and one of its hands while the skeletons of the sacrificial victims were intact.|$|E
5|$|Burial 67 {{was found}} in a cist under the second of five stucco floor levels in Northeast Plaza Structure 2. The {{skeleton}} was lying on its back with the head towards the north. The remains were poorly preserved but belonged to an adult. Of the skull only some dental remains were found. A ceramic plate had been placed under the head of the deceased and another plate was placed upon the knees. The plate was <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> four seated anthropomorphic figures with inclined head and wearing leather gloves with jaguar claws. The facial features of the figures are unusual. The bottom of the plate bears the image of a dancer. The ceramics date the burial to the Late Classic.|$|E
