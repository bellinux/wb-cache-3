40|$|International audienceThe use {{of driving}} {{simulators}} to assess driving abilities is often controversial {{because of their}} artificiality. Our aim is thus to tackle this question by estimating and comparing new indicators such as the mental workload, the <b>psychological</b> <b>feeling</b> (e. g., stress, anxi- ety, pleasure, and mastery), and feeling of presence when driving a simulator and a real vehicle (either one’s own or one that belongs to a driving school). We are most inter- ested in a particular sort of real-world driving: the driving school. This situation has two advantages: It matches our own particular interest {{in the evaluation of}} driving abilities and, to some extent, it is as artificial as driving in a simulator. Fourteen expert drivers participated in this study. Each driver was invited to complete two questionnaires (i. e., the NASA-TLX and Questionnaire of <b>Psychological</b> <b>Feeling)</b> that relate to the various driving conditions (i. e., simulator, driving school vehicle, and personal vehicle). The heart rate of drivers was also recorded at rest and during some of the driving condi- tions. Our results indicate that the feeling of presence was, for some of its component parts, identical in both the simulator and in a real car. Moreover, in both the simulator and real car, none of the assessments of presence revealed values that were close to 100 %; indeed, sometimes they were considerably lower. This result leads us to believe that presence may often be underestimated in virtual environments {{because of the lack of}} an objective value of reference in the real world. Moreover, results obtained for mental workload and affective feeling indicate that a simulator can be a useful tool for the initial resumption of driving after a period off the road. In particular, a simulator can help to avoid the sort of stress that can lead to task failure or a deterioration in per- formance...|$|E

Hence, based on social cognitive theory this study aims to identify the antecedents of moral disengagement by investigating the individual differences (gender and personality) and environmental influence (organizational ethical climate).

50|$|Psychologist Robert Sternberg (1986) {{developed}} the triangular theory of love. He theorized {{that love is}} a combination of three main components: passion (physical arousal); intimacy (<b>psychological</b> <b>feelings</b> of closeness); and commitment (the sustaining of a relationship). He also theorized that the different combinations of these three components could yield up to seven different forms of love. These include popularized forms such as romantic love (intimacy and passion) and consummate love (passion, intimacy, and commitment). The other forms are liking (intimacy), companionate love (intimacy and commitment), empty love (commitment), fatuous love (passion and commitment), and infatuation (passion).Studies on Sternberg’s theory love found that intimacy most strongly predicted marital satisfaction in married couples, with passion also being an important predictor (Silberman, 1995). On the other hand, Acker and Davis (1992) found that commitment was the strongest predictor of relationship satisfaction, especially for long-term relationships.|$|R
