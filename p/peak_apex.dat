30|$|The binding {{interface}} between AEBP 2379 – 390 and RBBP 4 {{is relatively small}} compared with PHF 6, histone H 3 and FOG- 1, indicating that AEBP 2379 – 390 {{may not have been}} the only region that participates in RBBP 4 recognition. To validate whether the three AEBP 2 zinc fingers interacts with RBBP 4, we conducted an ITC experiment with AEBP 2 ZF 1 – 3 titrating to RBBP 4. Of note, the interaction between these two proteins was confirmed with a dissociation constant (K d) of 10.1 ± 0.6 μmol/L (Fig.  2 D). Furthermore, we expressed the recombinant protein containing both ZF 1 – 3 and the RRK-rich motif (residues Asn 258 –Asp 396, hereafter referred to “ZF-RRK”). During gel filtration assays, a complex peak of RBBP 4 bound to AEBP 2 ZF-RRK was confirmed with overlaid curves of apo RBBP 4 and apo AEBP 2 ZF-RRK, together with corresponding SDS-PAGE (Figs.  2 E and S 6). The mixture <b>peak</b> <b>apex</b> of RBBP 4 bound to AEBP 2 ZF-RRK is at 13.44 mL, with apo RBBP 4 at 13.96 mL. The apo AEBP 2 ZF-RRK peak is a little asymmetric and the <b>peak</b> <b>apex</b> is at 16.26 mL, which lags little behind the exclusive AEBP 2 ZF-RRK (at 16.21 mL), which may be due to degradation.|$|E

The preparations characterized included the rabbit liver MT and its further purified MT- 1 and MT- 2 isoforms. The CZE-ICP-MS electrophoregrams showed the presence of several well (often baseline) separated Gaussian-shape peaks. ES-MS {{was used for the}} identification of these signals; mass spectra taken at the <b>peak</b> <b>apexes</b> were complex and indicated the co-existence of several metal complexes (possibly with different isoforms) within each peak. Many of these complexes could be identified {{on the basis of the}} molecular mass. The study highlights the attractive potential of CZE-ICP-MS and CZE-ES-MS when used in parallel for the characterization of metal complexes with biomolecular ligands. The inherent discrepancy between the sensitivities of ICP-MS and ES-MS is partly alleviated by the fact that the metal (detected by ICP-MS) constitutes only a small fraction of the total molecule (detected by ES-MS), and by the smaller dilution factor with the makeup sheath flow in ES-MS than in ICP-MS...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{semi-quantitative method}} was {{developed}} for the non-targeted detection of trace levels of human selenoproteins in cytoplasmic cell extracts {{without the use of}} radioactive isotopes. The method was based on the direct detection of selenoproteins in iso-electrofocusing (IEF) electrophoretic strips by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP MS). The proteins were identified in the non-ablated parts of the gel corresponding to the LA-ICP MS <b>peak</b> <b>apexes</b> by electrospray Orbitrap MS/MS. The method allowed a high resolution of the selenoproteins (peak width 0. 06 pH unit) using 3 - 10 pI strips. The protein detection limits were down to 1 ngmL- 1 (as Se). The method was applied to the selenoprotein speciation in different human cell lines: Hek 293 (kidney), HepG 2 (liver), HaCaT (skin) and LNCaP (prostate). The principal proteins found included Selenoprotein 15 (Sep 15), Glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx 1) and Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx 4) and Thioredoxin reductase 1 (TRxR 1) and Thioredoxin reductase 2 (TRxR 2). Biological significance: Our paper presents the development of a semi-quantitative method for the non-targeted detection of trace levels of human selenoproteins in cytoplasmic cell extracts; it offers a first comprehensive screening of the entire biological selenoproteomes expressed in cell lines without the use of radioactive 75 Se. The method was based on the direct detection of selenoproteins in iso-electrofocusing (IEF) electrophoretic strips by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP MS). The proteins were identified in the non-ablated parts of the gel corresponding to the LA-ICP MS <b>peak</b> <b>apexes</b> by electrospray Orbitrap MS/MS. The method allowed a high resolution of the selenoproteins (peak width 0. 06 pH unit) using 3 - 10 pI strips.

40|$|Liposomes are {{biodegradable}} nanoparticle vesicles {{consisting of}} a lipid bilayer encapsulating an aqueous core. Entrapped cargo material is shielded from the extra-vesicular medium and sustained release of encapsulated material can be achieved. However, application of liposomes as nano-carriers demands their characterization concerning size and size distribution, particle-number concentration, occurrence of vesicle building blocks in solution and determination of the resulting vesicle encapsulation capacity. These questions can be targeted via gas-phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analysis (GEMMA) based on a nano electrospray (nES) charge-reduction source. This instrument separates single-charged nanoparticles in the gas-phase according to size in a high-laminar sheath-flow {{by means of an}} orthogonal, tunable electric field. nES GEMMA analysis enables to confirm liposome integrity after passage through the instrument (in combination with atomic force microscopy) as well as to exclude vesicle aggregation. Additionally, nanoparticle diameters at <b>peak</b> <b>apexes</b> and size distribution data are obtained. Differences of hydrodynamic and dry particle diameter values, as well as the effect of number- and mass-based concentration data analysis on obtained liposome diameters are shown.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of potential age markers of Madeira wine is of paramount significance {{as it may}} contribute to detect frauds and to ensure the authenticity of wine. Considering the chemical groups of furans, lactones, volatile phenols, and acetals, 103 volatile compounds were tentatively identified; among these, 71 have been reported {{for the first time}} in Madeira wines. The chemical groups that could be used as potential age markers were predominantly acetals, namely, diethoxymethane, 1, 1 -diethoxyethane, 1, 1 -diethoxy- 2 -methyl-propane, 1 -(1 -ethoxyethoxy) -pentane, trans-dioxane and 2 -propyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane, and from the other chemical groups, 5 -methylfurfural and cis-oak-lactone, independently of the variety and the type of wine. GC × GC-ToFMS system offers a more useful approach to identify these compounds compared to previous studies using GC−qMS, due to the orthogonal systems, that reduce coelution, increase peak capacity and mass selectivity, contributing to the {{establishment of}} new potential Madeira wine age markers. Remarkable results were also obtained in terms of compound identification based on the organized structure of the peaks of structurally related compounds in the GC × GC <b>peak</b> <b>apex</b> plots.

40|$|International audienceThe {{reaction}} of sunflower oil with selenite produces a complex mixture of selenitriglycerides with antioxidant and anticancer properties. To obtain {{insight into the}} identity and characteristics of the species formed, an analytical approach based on the combination of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with 78 Se-specific selenium detection by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS) and high-resolution (100   000), high mass accuracy (< 1 ppm) molecule-specific detection by electrospray–Orbitrap MS 3 was developed. For the first time, a non-aqueous mobile phase gradient was used in reversed-phase HPLC–ICP MS for the separation of a complex mixture of selenospecies and a mathematical correction of the background signal was developed. The identical chromatographic conditions served for the sample introduction into electrospray MS. Two types of samples were analyzed: sunflower oil dissolved in isopropanol and methanol extract of the oil containing 65 % selenium. HPLC–ICP MS showed 14 peaks, 11 of which could also be detected in the methanol extract. Isotopic patterns corresponding to molecules {{with one or two}} selenium atoms could be attributed by Orbitrap MS at the retention times corresponding to the HPLC–ICP MS <b>peak</b> <b>apexes.</b> Structural data for these species were acquired by MS 2 and MS 3 fragmentation of protonated or sodiated ions using high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD). A total of 11 selenium-containing triglycerol derivatives resulting from the oxidation of one or two double bonds of linoleic acid and analogous derivatives of glycerol-mixed linoleate(s) /oleinate(s) have been identified for the first time. The presence of these species was confirmed by the targeted analysis in the total oil isopropanol solution. Their identification corroborated the predicted elution order in reversed-phase chromatography: LLL (glycerol trilinoleate), LLO (glycerol dilinoleate–oleinate), LOO (glycerol linoleate–dioleinate), OOO (glycerol trioleinate), of which the extrapolation allowed for the prediction of the identity [glycerol dioleinate–stearate (OOS) and glycerol oleinate–distearate (OSS) ] of the nonpolar species detected by ICP MS in the oil but not detected by electrospray MS...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} first {{presents the}} work on measuring thermal properties of MgH 2 nanostructures at microscale by using laser-based method [...] photothermal technique. In order to investigate the thermal properties at nanoscale, a scanning photothermal microscopy (SPTM) system is proposed. In the SPTM, {{the most important part}} is the complex tip-laser interaction. Systematical work has been done to in this field. For the first part, the photothermal technique is used to measure the effective thermal conductivity and density of the vanadium-doped MgH 2 nanostructures which is extensively used in energy storage applications. A multilayer physical model is used to fit the experimental data. Our results show that the effective thermal conductivity of the hydrogenated V-doped Mg nanostructures is in the range of 1. 16  2. 40 W/(m∙K), and the density falls in the range of 878  1320 kg/m 3. The measured density agrees well with the estimation from electron micrograph observation. Variation in the measurements indicates strong non-uniformity of the sample structure and thickness. Based on the measured density and effective thermal conductivity, the thermal conductivity of bulk V-doped Mg hydrides is also evaluated using Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 s correlation. For the second part, scanning photothermal microscopy (SPTM) system is designed to diagnose the defects on sub-surface under nanoscale range. This system consists of a conventional AFM and an external laser. Due to the complex interaction between the sharp tip and the laser, the thermal response of tungsten tip was first studied. At first step, we systematically report on a study of highly enhanced optical field and its induced thermal transport in nanotips under laser irradiation. Our Poynting vectors study clearly shows when a laser interacts with a metal tip, it is bent around the tip and concentrated under the apex, where extremely high field enhancement appears. This phenomenon is more like a liquid flow being forced/squeezed to go through a narrow channel. How the geometry of the tip, the tip-substrate distance, polarization angle and incident angle of laser affect the field enhancement are systematically presented. The thermal transport inside the nanoscale tungsten tips due to absorption of incident laser is also explored. As the polarization angle or apex radius increases, the <b>peak</b> <b>apex</b> temperature decreases. The <b>peak</b> <b>apex</b> temperature goes down as the cone angle increases, even though the mean laser intensity inside the tip increases, revealing a very strong effect of the cone angle on thermal transport. Correspondingly, experimental work on the laser-tip interaction was reported. The temperature rise of an ordinary AFM silicon tip under laser irradiation was measured. Laser heated AFM tip can act as both thermal probe and thermal heating source in nanoscale thermal heating process. The elevated temperature of the tip can be acquired from the relationship between Raman shift vs. temperature, which, however, is different compared to the Raman shift-temperature curve for bulk Si. The influences of focal position and energy flux level on the Raman shift have been discussed intensively. We substantiate our Raman measurement by theoretically modeling the electric field distribution as well as the heating processing through finite element method and a one-dimensional model, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A 1 -D loop {{radiative}} {{hydrodynamic model}} that incorporates {{the effects of}} gravitational stratification, heat conduction, radiative losses, external heat input, presence of helium, and Braginskii viscosity is used to simulate elementary flare loops. The physical parameters for the input are taken from observations of the Bastille-Day flare of 2000 July 14. The present analysis shows that: (a) The obtained maximum values of the electron density can be considerably higher (4. 2 × 10 11 cm − 3 or more) {{in the case of}} footpoint heating than in the case of apex heating (2. 5 × 10 11 cm − 3). (b) The average cooling time after the flare peak takes less time in the case of footpoint heating than in the case of apex heating. (c) The <b>peak</b> <b>apex</b> temperatures are significantly lower (by about 10 MK) for the case of footpoint heating than for apex heating (for the same average loop temperature of about 30 MK). This characteristic allows us to discriminate between different heating positioning.

40|$|Purpose: Previous {{work on the}} {{temporal}} coordination between gesture and speech found that the prominence in gesture coordinates with speech prominence. This study investigates the anchoring regions in speech and pointing gesture aligning with each other. Our hypotheses are that (a) in contrastive focus conditions the gesture apex is anchored in the intonation peak, (b) the upcoming prosodic boundary influences the timing of gesture and intonation movements. Method: 15 Catalan speakers pointed at a screen while pronouncing a target word with different metrical patterns in a contrastive focus condition and followed by a phrase boundary. A total of 702 co-speech deictic gestures were acoustically and gesturally analyzed. Results: Intonation <b>peaks</b> and gesture <b>apexes</b> showed parallel behavior {{with respect to their}} position within the accented syllable: they occurred {{at the end of the}} accented syllable in non-phrase-final position, whereas they occurred well before the end of the accented syllable in phrase-final position. Crucially, the position of intonation <b>peaks</b> and gesture <b>apexes</b> was correlated and was bound by prosodic structure. Conclusions: The results refine the phonological synchronization rule (McNeill, 1992), showing that gesture apexes are anchored in intonation peaks, and that gesture and prosodic movements are bound by prosodic phrasing.

With the current investigation we demonstrate chip electrophoresis of fluorescently (FL) labeled gelatin nanoparticles (gelatin NPs) on a commercially available instrument. FL labeling included a step {{for the removal of}} low molecular mass material (especially excess dye molecules). Nevertheless, for the investigated gelatin NP preparation two analyte peaks, one very homogeneous with an electrophoretic net mobility of mu = − 24. 6 ± 0. 3 × 10 − 9 m 2 /Vs at the <b>peak</b> <b>apex</b> (n = 17) and another more heterogeneous peak with mu between approximately − 27. 2 ± 0. 2 × 10 − 9 m 2 /Vs and − 36. 6 ± 0. 2 × 10 − 9 m 2 /Vs at the peak beginning and end point (n = 11, respectively) were recorded. Filtration allowed enrichment of particles in the size range of approximately 35 nm (pore size employed for concentration of gelatin NPs) to 200 nm (pore size employed during FL labeling). This corresponded to the very homogeneous peak linking it to gelatin NPs, whereas the more heterogeneous peak probably corresponds to gelatin not cross-linked to such a high degree (NP building blocks). Several further gelatin NP preparations were analyzed according to the same protocol yielding peaks with electrophoretic netmobilities between − 23. 3 ± 0. 3 × 10 − 9 m 2 /Vs and − 28. 9 ± 0. 2 × 10 − 9 m 2 /Vs at peak apexes (n = 15 and 6). Chip electrophoresis allows analyte separation in less than two minutes (including electrophoretic sample injection). Together with the high sensitivity of the FL detection – the LOD as derived for the first main peak of the applied dye from the threefold standard deviation of the background noise values 80 pM for determined separation conditions – this leads to a very promising high throughput separation technique especially for the analysis of bionanoparticles. For gelatin NP preparations, chip electrophoresis allows for example the comparison of preparation batches concerning the amount of NPs and gelatin building blocks as well as the indirect assessment of the degree of gelatin cross-linking (from obtained FL signals).

This thesis explores the effect of three techniques to improve the depth and quality of cemented acetabular component fixation in primary total hip replacement. This may have beneficial effects on the longevity of cemented acetabular components and reduce the rate of revision surgery for aseptic loosening. Aims: 1. Determine {{the effect of the}} rim cutter on cement pressure during cup insertion. 2. Examine the effect of the rim cutter on cement penetration distance. 3. Evaluate the effect of bone grafting of the acetabular notch. 4. Determine the effect of iliac suction during cement pressurisation. 5. Compare the behaviour of bone cement with Play Dough. Materials and Methods: 1. Sawbones hemi pelvis models were fitted with pressure transducers at the rim and apex of the acetabulum. Peak pressure was measured upon insertion of cups with different flange sizes and when the acetabulum was prepared with the rim cutter. 2. Foam cavities were used to measure the depth of cement penetration when the same cups and rim cutter were used. 3. Hemi pelvis models were modified to simulate bone grafting of the acetabular notch. Again, pressure sensors were mounted at the apex and rim of the acetabulum. Intra-acetabular cement pressure was compared with native acetabulae. 4. A back bleeding model of the acetabulum was fitted with a suction catheter. The effect on cement penetration into cancellous bone was measured compared with no suction. 5. Play Dough pressurisation and penetration into hemi pelvises and foam was compared to bone cement. Results: 1. Significant increase in <b>peak</b> <b>apex</b> and rim pressures when flanged cup inserted into an acetabulum prepared with the rim cutter compared with both flanged and unflanged cups alone. 2. Significant increase in cement penetration at the rim of the acetabulum when rim cutter used and flanged cup inserted when compared with flanged and unflanged cups alone. 3. Significant increase in intra-acetabular pressure when cement pressurised in presence of simulated acetabular notch bone grafting compared with normal acetabulae. 4. Significant increase in cement penetration distance when suction used compared with no suction. 5. Significant differences in the flow characteristics between bone cement and Play Dough.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} the position of prosodic heads (accented syllables) and prosodic edges (prosodic word and intonational phrase boundaries) on the timing of head movements. Gesture movements and prosodic events tend to be temporally aligned in the discourse, the most prominent part of gestures typically being aligned with prosodically prominent syllables in speech. However, {{little is known about the}} impact of the position of intonational phrase boundaries on gesture-speech alignment patterns. Twenty-four Catalan speakers produced spontaneous (experiment 1) and semi-spontaneous head gestures with a confirmatory function (experiment 2), along with phrase-final focused words in different prosodic conditions (stress-initial, stress-medial, and stress-final). Results showed (a) that the scope of head movements is the associated focused prosodic word, (b) that the left edge of the focused prosodic word determines where the interval of gesture prominence starts, and (c) that the speech-anchoring site for the gesture <b>peak</b> (or <b>apex)</b> depends both on the location of the accented syllable and the distance to the upcoming intonational phrase boundary. These results demonstrate that prosodic heads and edges have an impact on the timing of head movements, and therefore that prosodic structure plays a central role in the timing of co-speech gestures.

40|$|AbstractThe global distribution, {{seasonal}} evolution, {{and underlying}} mechanisms for the climatological midsummer drought (MSD) are investigated using {{a suite of}} relatively high spatial and temporal resolution station observations and reanalysis data with particular focus on the Pacific coast of Central America and southern Mexico. Although the MSD of Central America stands out in terms of spatial scale and coherence, it is neither unique to the Greater Caribbean Region (GCR) nor necessarily the strongest MSD on Earth based on an objective analysis of several global precipitation data sets. A mechanism for the MSD is proposed that relates the latitudinal dependence of the two climatological precipitation maxima to the biannual crossing of the solar declination (SD), driving two peaks in convective instability and hence rainfall. In addition to this underlying local mechanism, a number of remote processes tend to <b>peak</b> during the <b>apex</b> of the MSD, including the North American monsoon, the Caribbean low-level jet, and the North Atlantic subtropical high which may also act to suppress rainfall along the Pacific coast of Central America and generate interannual variability in the strength or timing of the MSD. However, our findings challenge the existing paradigm that the MSD owes its existence to a precipitation-suppressing mechanism. Rather, aided by the analysis of higher-temporal resolution precipitation records and considering variations in latitude, we suggest the MSD is essentially the result of one precipitation-enhancing mechanism occurring twice...|$|R

Conversely, in sinuous point bar rivers bankfull width <b>peaks</b> at bend <b>apexes.</b> Why? Is there any mechanistic constraint that forces this different behavior? We provide {{an answer to}} these questions investigating how bankfull width must vary in a sequence of sine-generated meanders {{in order for the}} constraints of equilibrium (constant flow discharge and sediment flux) to be satisfied. With the help of a 3 -D fully nonlinear analytical model of flow and bed topography in meandering rivers with variable width, we show that, in a meandering channel characterized by a constant longitudinal free-surface slope, the equilibrium width thus obtained oscillates with a frequency twice the frequency of channel curvature and experiences the maximum width close to inflection points. This pattern is typically observed in canaliform rivers. We then show that a similar pattern is observed in sinuous point bar rivers, provided the hydrodynamic width (width of the free surface) is replaced by the active width, namely the width of the portion of the cross section where transport occurs at formative conditions. Theoretical results are substantiated by a satisfactory comparison with field observations referring to the Mississippi River (United States) and to the Bollin River (United Kingdom) ...|$|R
40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a coupled {{three-dimensional}} computational model of cardiac electromechanics to investigate fibre length transients and the role of electrical heterogeneity in determining left ventricular function. METHODS: A mathematical model of cellular electromechanics was embedded in a simple geometric model of the cardiac left ventricle. Electrical and mechanical boundary conditions were applied based on Purkinje fibre activation times and ventricular volumes through the heart cycle. The mono-domain reaction diffusion equations and finite deformation elasticity equations were solved simultaneously through the full pump cycle. Simulations were run to assess the importance of cellular electrical heterogeneity on myocardial mechanics. RESULTS: Following electrical activation, mechanical contraction moves out through the wall to the circumferentially oriented mid-wall fibres, producing a progressively longitudinal and twisting deformation. This is followed by a more spherical deformation as the inclined epicardial fibres are activated. Mid-way between base and <b>apex</b> <b>peak</b> tensions and fibre shortening of 40 kPa and 5 %, respectively, are generated at the endocardial surface with values of 18 kPa and 12 % at the epicardial surface. Embedding an electrically homogeneous cell model for the same simulations produced equivalent values of 36. 5 kPa, 4 % at the endocardium and 14 kPa, 13. 5 % at the epicardium. CONCLUSION: The substantial redistribution of fibre lengths during the early pre-ejection phase of systole may play a significant role in preparing the mid-wall fibres to contract. The inclusion of transmural heterogeneity of action potential duration has a marked effect on reducing sarcomere length transmural dispersion during repolarization...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a fully automatic facial expression analysis {{system based on}} the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). FACS is the best known and {{the most commonly used}} system to describe facial activity in terms of facial muscle actions (i. e., action units, AUs). We will present our research on the analysis of the morphological, spatio-temporal and behavioural aspects of facial expressions. In contrast with most other researchers in the field who use appearance based techniques, we use a geometric feature based approach. We will argue that that approach is more suitable for analysing facial expression temporal dynamics. Our system is capable of explicitly exploring the temporal aspects of facial expressions from an input colour video in terms of their onset (start), <b>apex</b> (<b>peak)</b> and offset (end). The fully automatic system presented here detects 20 facial points in the first frame and tracks them throughout the video. From the tracked points we compute geometry-based features which serve as the input to the remainder of our systems. The AU activation detection system uses GentleBoost feature selection and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to find which AUs were present in an expression. Temporal dynamics of active AUs are recognised by a hybrid GentleBoost-SVM-Hidden Markov model classifier. The system is capable of analysing 23 out of 27 existing AUs with high accuracy. The main contributions of the work presented in this thesis are the following: we have created a method for fully automatic AU analysis with state-of-the-art recognition results. We have proposed {{for the first time a}} method for recognition of the four temporal phases of an AU. We have build the largest comprehensive database of facial expressions to date. We also present for the first time in the literature two studies for automatic distinction between posed and spontaneous expressions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The cochlea is {{the part}} of the ear where sound is {{analysed}} into frequencies. It is partitioned into two channels by a flexible membrane, whose effective density varies little along the length but whose stiffness reduces by a factor 104 from base to apex. Via the stapes near the base of the cochlea, the incoming sound excites travelling waves on the cochlear partition. The standard theory is that they travel to a frequency-dependent place where the cochlear partition is resonant with the sound frequency and thus is excited to relatively large amplitude there. The response to high frequencies peaks a short distance from the base, that for lower frequencies <b>peaks</b> towards the <b>apex</b> of the cochlea. Thus the cochlea separates frequencies by location of the peak response along the cochlear partition, from where they are transduced into neural signals to the brain. Mathematically, such a scenario falls into the class of critical-layer resonance models, well known in plasma physics, fluid dynamics and atmospheric science. It is suggested here, however, that the frequency selectivity of the ear may be based on mode conversion rather than critical-layer resonance. Mode conversion is a phenomenon discovered in plasma physics in which two modes of wave in an inhomogeneous medium completely interconvert. Waves entering in one mode travel to a frequency-dependent place where they turn round and travel back in the other mode. The wave amplitude grows to a peak at the turning point. Thus mode conversion is an equally good mechanism for frequency analysis. By comparing the theory with some of the wealth of experimental data, several inconsistencies of critical-layer resonance with the cochlea are pointed out, and it is found that they can be removed by mode conversion. Furthermore, critical-layer models are not robust to addition of higher derivatives: they generically deform to mode conversion or a case with no singularity. A proposal is made for a physiological mechanism for mode conversion to arise in the cochlea, based on forces produced by outer hair cells (which so far have primarily been invoked only to cancel damping). Other sources for mode conversion are possible too, however, notably two-membrane models. The analysis is carried out at the linearised level, though extension to incorporate nonlinear effects is an essential next step. The key result {{of this article is to}} highlight mode conversion as a highly plausible mechanism for the frequency selectivity of the cochlea, much more likely than critical-layer resonance, and to stimulate further investigation of this option...|$|R
