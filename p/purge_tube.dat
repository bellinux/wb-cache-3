The aluminum alloy A- 40 provides the needed characteristics of these applications. This project developed packaging techniques using the A- 40 alloy as a housing material and laser welding processes to install connectors, <b>purge</b> <b>tube,</b> and covers on the housings.

40|$|Evaporative {{emissions}} {{account for}} 15 - 20 % of total hydrocarbon emission from a gasoline engine. Evaporative emissions from {{the fuel tank}} and the carburettor are inevitable from gasoline or gasoline like fuel operating vehicle because of their highly evaporative nature. Evaporative emission control technique are introduced in S. I. engine vehicles {{in order to reduce}} the hydrocarbon emission. Charcoal canister is a fuel evaporative emission control device that is fitted between the space between the fuel tank, carburettor and the intake manifold. The design of the charcoal canister plays an important role for the maximum reduction of hydrocarbon. The present work aims to design a charcoal canister consisting of inlet tubes for fuel vapour from the fuel tank and the carburettor for introducing vapour into the charcoal canister and a bed of adsorbent, EPDM(ethylene-propylene-diene monomer) foam filter to trap liquid gasoline and heavy hydrocarbons that may spill from the fuel tank and the float of the carburettor. A vapour <b>purge</b> <b>tube</b> in the fluid communication with the bed of activated charcoal for purging fuel from the bed. A exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system is used to enhance the desorption of the vapour fuels due to higher temperature and evaluate the performance of different adsorbent materials(activated carbon powder, charred wood powder) by experimentation with help of a fabricated charcoal canister...|$|E
40|$|Maximizing {{the turbine}} entry {{temperature}} (TET) is fundamental to increase engine efficiency and reducing fuel consumption. Nonetheless, safety and reliability requirements have to be fulfilled. The life of gas turbine blades is strictly connected to their temperature through the creep deformation process. For this reason temperature monitoring is an essential requirement. Commonly this is achieved by means of devices such as thermocouples which are placed in the bulk flow. The usefulness of these devices as the means of supplying turbine blade temperature information is limited given their slow response time {{and the fact that}} the blade temperature is inferred from that of the surrounding gas rather than measured directly. This in turn means that critical blades parts (e. g., trailing edge) or the presence of hot spots are not identified in a discrete manner. These drawbacks can be addressed by using instead a radiation pyrometer, which is characterized by a fast response time, high accuracy, and by being contactless. The pyrometer optical front-end is a lens which collects the radiation emitted by a spot on the turbine blades. However, since the lens is exposed to the harsh engine environment, contaminants entrapped by the turbine flow can therefore be easily deposited on the lens thus filtering the radiation and resulting in an under-estimation of the actual blade temperature. The fouling of the lens is generally tackled by using a purge air system that employs air bled from the compressor to divert those particles whose trajectory is directed towards the lens. Currently the employment of optical pyrometry is often confined to military applications due to the fact that their {{turbine entry temperature}}s are higher than in civil applications. Besides, the maintenance schedule established for military engines is far more frequent than what is practiced in airline engines. Therefore, the design of current purge air systems reflects these facts. Before optical pyrometers can be commonly used for civil applications more research is required since some of the fundamentals of the fouling mechanisms remain to be clarified. This is then the knowledge gap the present research sought to fill. Its aim was to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the phenomena that underpins the lens fouling process in order to provide a set of guidelines for optimising the design of purge air systems. The initial part of the research was dedicated to the study of the purge flow inside a given pyrometer configuration. The scope was to identify the main flow structure that determines the fouling process and at the same time to validate the results obtained via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses conducted in a second phase of the research. Given the reduced dimensions of the pyrometer purge system, it was not possible to gain the appropriate optical access to take flow measurements. Consequently, a large scaled experiment was performed, employing the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique for the acquisition of experimental data of the flow field. The distortion of the image and light reflection introduced by the presence of curved glass surfaces was investigated by means of a feasibility experiment. The experimental study highlighted the presence of a large recirculation zone that can trap contaminants and direct them towards the pyrometer lens. The experimental data were in agreement with computational fluid dynamics results obtained by using two different turbulence models. In a second instance, attention was focused on the particle deposition as seen from a fluid dynamics perspective. A computational fluid dynamics analysis aimed at reproducing the flow field of an existing pyrometer purge system enabled the identification of those features that can significantly impact on the lens fouling process. It was found that the geometry of the air curtain configuration plays a fundamental role. However, given the high speeds involved, the main force governing the contaminants deposition is the drag. Additionally, particles with high inertia hit the <b>purge</b> <b>tube</b> wall and then bounce towards the pyrometer lens, while contaminants with low inertia can be trapped by a large recirculation zone and subsequently directed towards the lens. In a third phase of the research, the impacts between the contaminant particles and the lens were investigated through a finite element analysis (FEA) aimed at identifying the most important factors that contribute to the lens fouling process. Particles moving at low speed can be deposited on the lens by means of electrostatic and Van der Waals forces. Conversely, particles with very high velocity can be deposited on the lens through the same mechanisms involved in the cold spraying process, which is a technique commonly used for coating deposition. A local melting can occur at the interface between the lens and the contaminants due to the high stresses created by the asperities and high sliding velocity of the particles. As a result, while large particles bounce back, debris remains bonded to the lens surface. Last but not least, the findings of the several steps of the present research have been brought together in order to produce guidelines to be followed by engineers engaged in the redesign of more efficient pyrometer purge systems...|$|E

Initially, approximately 0.2 g of fine Sn powder (Aldrich, < 150 μm, 99.5 %) was weighed and loaded into a quartz boat together with a square piece of Si(111) which was coated with 0.5 nm of Au. The Au layer was deposited via sputtering at a slow rate < 5 Å/s using an Ar plasma under a pressure < 10 − 4 mBar. The sample was positioned a few mm downstream from the Sn and subsequently the boat was loaded into the reactor and positioned directly above the thermocouple {{used to measure the}} heater temperature at the centre of tube. After loading the boat at room temperature (RT), Ar (99.999 %) was introduced at a flow rate of 500 standard cubic centimetres per minute (sccm) for 5 min in order to <b>purge</b> the <b>tube.</b>|$|R

30|$|In {{the case}} of direct {{oxidation}} at high temperatures, fine In powder (Aldrich, Mesh- 100, 99.99 %) was weighed and loaded into a quartz boat together with a Au/Si(111) and plain Si(111) sample. The Au/Si(111) sample was positioned about 5 mm over the In and the Si(111) about 10 mm downstream from the In powder. Then the boat was loaded into the quartz tube reactor and positioned directly above the thermocouple {{used to measure the}} heater temperature at the centre of tube. After loading the boat at room temperature (RT), Ar (99.999 %) was introduced at a flow rate of 500 standard cubic centimetres per minute (sccm) for 10 min, in order to <b>purge</b> the <b>tube.</b> Following this, the temperature was ramped to the desired growth temperature (TG) in a reduced Ar flow of 100 sccm.

The sample was removed only when the temperature was lower than 100 °C.|$|R

A Au/Si(111) sample was positioned over the mixture of In and NH 4 Cl and a Si(111) sample without Au downstream from the mixture as described above.

Finally the InN NCs were obtained by using an equimolar mixture of In:NH 4 Cl and exactly the same growth conditions that {{led to the formation of}} InN nanowires by direct nitridation of In at 600 °C under a gas flow of 250 sccm NH 3 which is described in detail elsewhere [31].|$|R
30|$|NWs {{were grown}} using an APCVD reactor which {{consists}} of four mass flow controllers (MFC’s) and a horizontal quartz tube furnace, capable of reaching a maximum temperature of 1, 100 °C. Initially, fine Sn powder (Aldrich, < 150 μm, 99.5 %) was loaded into a quartz boat together with a square piece of Si(111) approximately 7 mm × 7 mm in size, which was coated with a few nm’s of Au. The Au layer was deposited via sputtering at a slow rate using an Ar plasma under a pressure < 10 − 4 mBar. The Au/Si(111) sample was positioned ≈ 5 mm downstream from the Sn and subsequently the boat was loaded into the APCVD reactor and positioned directly above the thermocouple {{used to measure the}} heater temperature at the centre of the quartz tube. After loading the boat at room temperature (RT), Ar (99.999 %) was introduced at a flow rate of 500 standard cubic centimetres per minute (sccm) for 5 min in order to <b>purge</b> the <b>tube</b> and eliminate O 2 and H 2 O. Following this the temperature was ramped to the desired growth temperature in a NH 3 flow of 250 sccm at a rate of 30 °C/min.

30|$|In {{order to}} grow InN NWs, we used ≈ 0.2 g of fine In powder (Aldrich, Mesh- 100, 99.99 %) that was loaded {{in the center}} of a quartz boat. Two samples of Au/Si(111) were then loaded into the quartz boat; one ≈ 5 mm above the In powder and another ≈ 10 mm {{downstream}} from the In powder. Subsequently, the quartz boat was loaded into a quartz tube with a 25 -mm diameter, right at its centre and directly above the thermocouple used to measure the heater temperature. After loading the quartz boat at room temperature (RT), nitrogen N 2 (99.999 %) was introduced at 500 standard cubic centimetres per minute (sccms) for 5 min in order to <b>purge</b> the <b>tube</b> and eliminate oxygen and moisture. Following this, the temperature was ramped to the desired growth temperature (TG) over a 30 -min interval in a continuous flow of NH 3 at 250 sccms. Upon reachingTGthe flow of NH 3 was maintained at 250 sccms for a further 60 min in order to grow the InN NWs after which the quartz tube was allowed to cool down slowly in a reduced flow of 50 sccms of NH 3 for at least 60 min in order to prevent dissociation of the InN NWs. On reaching RT, the quartz boat was removed from the tube. For the optical measurements, InN NWs were grown directly onto square pieces of quartz with an area of ≈ 1 cm 2. The morphology of the InN NWs was examined with a TESCAN scanning electron microscope (SEM). The crystal structure and the phase purity of the InN NWs were investigated using a SHIMADZU, XRD- 6000, X-ray diffractometer and Cu Ka source. A scan of θ– 2 θ in the range between 10 ° and 80 ° was performed for the InN NWs that were grown on Si(111) and quartz.|$|R
40|$|The Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (SBWR) {{proposed}} by General Electric (GE) is an advanced light water reactor (ALWR) design that utilizes passive safety systems. The PCCS {{is a series}} of heat exchangers submerged in water and open to the containment. Since the containment is inerted with nitrogen during normal operation, the PCCS must condense the steam in the presence of noncondensable gases during an accident. To model the transient behavior of the SBWR with a system code, the code should properly simulate the expected phenomena. To validate the applicability of RELAP 5 MOD 3. 1. 1, the data from three Phase 1, Step 2 nitrogen venting tests at Toshiba`s Gravity-Driven Integral Full-Height Test for Passive Heat Removal facility and RELAP 5 calculations of these tests were compared. The comparison of the GIRAFFE data against the results from the RELAP 5 calculations showed that it can predict condensation and gas purging phenomena occurring in the long-term decay heat rejection phase. In this phase of the transient, condensation in the PCCS is the only means to reject heat from the SBWR containment. In the two tests where the nitrogen purge vent line was at its deepest submergence in the Suppression Pool (SIP), the RELAP 5 results mirrored the behavior of the containment pressures and of the water levels in the Horizontal Vent (HV) and the nitrogen <b>purge</b> line <b>tube</b> of the GIRAFFE data. However, in the test with the shallowest purge line submergence, there was appreciable direct contact condensation on the pool surface of the HV despite modeling efforts to deter these phenomena. This surface condensation, unobserved in the GIRAFFE tests, was a major cause of RELAP 5 predicting early containment depressurization and the subsequent early rise in HV and nitrogen purge line water levels. The present RELAP 5 MOD 3. 1. 1 interfacial heat and mass transfer model does not properly degrade direct contact steam condensation in the presence of noncondensable gases sitting on a pool...|$|R
40|$|The {{shelf life}} of a fresh meat product can be {{measured}} by a total bacterial enumeration method, which is time-consuming, expensive, and destructive to conduct. Due to these issues, there is interest in developing a shelf life model from an instrument measurement, which has the capability to be less time-consuming, less expensive, and non-destructive. One instrument measurement {{that could be used}} to estimate shelf life is dissolved carbon dioxide (CO 2). There are few studies published that investigate dissolved CO 2 concentrations in the context of shelf life or its relationship to the microbial population. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine the dissolved CO 2 and O 2 concentrations in the purge of vacuum-packaged pork chops during storage, and to determine the relationship between dissolved CO 2 and O 2 concentrations to the microbial populations and shelf life. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were also taken of the packaging film in contact with the meat product to investigate how the biofilm develops on the packaging film throughout the shelf life. These objectives were completed by taking sixty pork loin chops and placing them into twenty vacuum-packages. In each vacuum-package, a set of <b>purge</b> collection <b>tubes</b> were placed into each bag to collect the purge for the dissolved gas measurements. These packages were stored at 4 °C for 60 days, and the packages were sampled randomly on days 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60. On the sample days, the dissolved gases were measured and microbiological analysis conducted. The results of the experiment demonstrated that the spoilage bacteria increased the dissolved CO 2 and decreased the dissolved O 2 concentrations during the 60 day storage period by cellular respiration. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) dominated the spoilage microflora, followed by Enterobacteriaceae and Brochothrix thermosphacta. Since the dissolved CO 2 concentrations increased due to the increase in microbial populations, this information was used to develop mathematical models. These mathematical models estimate microbial populations and shelf life based upon dissolved CO 2 concentrations in the purge of vacuum-packaged pork chops. The SEM images revealed a two-layer biofilm on the packaging film that was the result of a tri-phase growth environment...|$|R
40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Combustion Science and Technology on 30 / 09 / 2014, available online: [URL] volume combustion (CVC) in gas turbines is a promising way to achieve a step change in the efficiency of such systems. The most widely investigated technique to implement CVC in gas turbine systems is pulsed detonation combustion (PDC). Unfortunately, the PDC is associated with several disadvantages, such as sharp pressure transitions, entropy generation due to shock waves, and exergy losses due to kinetic energy. This work proposes {{a new way to}} implement CVC in a gas turbine combustion system: shockless explosion combustion (SEC). This technique utilizes acoustic waves inside the combustor to fill and <b>purge</b> the combustion <b>tube.</b> The combustion itself is controlled via the ignition delay time of the fuel-air mixture. By adjusting the ignition delay in a way such that the entire fuel-air volume undergoes homogeneous auto-ignition, no shock waves occur. Accordingly, the losses associated with a detonation wave are not present in the proposed system. Instead, a smooth pressure rise is created due to the heat release of the homogeneous combustion. The current paper explains the SEC process in detail, and presents the identified challenges. Solutions to these challenges and the numerical and experimental approach are presented subsequently alongside with first preliminary results of the numerical studies.

40|$|In this report, we {{describe}} the work done in FY 1998 at Los Alamos National Laboratory {{as part of the}} Hydrologic Resources Management Program (HRMA) funded by the Nevada Operations Office of the US Department of Energy (DOE/NV). The major part of our research effort was to measure radionuclides present in water or soil samples collected from near nuclear tests. We report our measurements for materials collected in both saturated and unsaturated horizons adjacent to nuclear test cavities or collapse chimneys and from within several cavities. Soil samples collected from above the cavities formed by the Halfbeak, Jerboa, and Bobac tests contained no radioactivity, although a test similar to Bobac in the same area had been contaminated with {sup 137 }Cs. Water samples from near the Shoal test contained no measurable radionuclides, whereas those from near Faultless and Aleman had concentrations similar to previous measurements. Water from the Tybo-Benham site was similar to earlier collections at that site; this year, we added {sup 241 }Am to the list of radionuclides measured at this location. Two Bennett pumps in tandem were used to extract water from the piezometer tube in the cavity of the Dalhart event. This extraction is a significant achievement in that it opens the possibility of <b>purging</b> similar <b>tubes</b> at other locations on the NTS. The Cheshire post shot hole was reconfigured and pumped from two horizons {{for the first time since}} mid- 1980. We are especially interested in examining water from the level of the working point to determine the hydrologic source term in a cavity filled with groundwater for over 20 years. We devoted much time this year to examining the colloid content of NTS groundwater. After developing protocols for collecting, handling, and storing groundwater samples without altering their colloid content, we analyzed water from the Tybo-Benham and from the Cheshire sites. Whereas the colloid concentration did not vary much with depth at Tybo-Benham, there were 20 times more colloids in groundwater from the Cheshire cavity than were found a few hundred meters higher. Electron micrographs show the wide variety of colloid sizes and shapes present in NTS groundwater. Our experiences with filtration of groundwater samples illustrate the difficulties of colloid size characterization using this methodology.

40|$|Propulsion {{systems that}} utilize hypergolic {{propellants}} {{have been used}} to power space vehicles {{since the beginning of the}} space program. Liquid methane and oxygen propulsion systems have emerged as an alternative and have proven to be more environmentally friendly. The incorporation of liquid methane/liquid oxygen (LOX) into the propulsion system has demonstrated an increase in engine performance, as well as a reduction in the volume, size and complexity of the system. Consequently, reducing the total mass of the vehicle which is a crucial aspect that is considered when planning space missions to both the Moon and Mars [1]. Project Morpheus has made significant advancements in liquid oxygen/liquid methane propulsion system technologies by incorporating a LOX/methane propulsion system to a vertical test bed. The vehicle consisted of a 5, 000 lb main engine and four 20 lb remote control system (RCS) engines that utilize liquid methane/LOX as its propellant [1]. The vehicle completed successful flight testing at Kennedy Space Center in 2014 which marked the completion of the Morpheus project. Subsequent projects utilizing Morpheus' vertical test bed have been developed to make further advancements. One of the subsequent projects consisted of the addition of a smaller 2, 000 lb main engine and a cold helium heat exchanger which would make it possible for a pressurant tank systems to be send to Mars or the Moon by significantly decreasing the overall mass and volume of the pressurant tank. The hot fire tests of the integrated system with the smaller main engine and cold helium heat exchanger were successful at sea level, but further studies are being conducted to better understand how the vertical test bed will behave under thermal-vacuum conditions. For this reason, the integrated vehicle will be taken to Plum Brook to be tested in a chamber capable of simulating these conditions. To ensure that the vehicle will function properly under vacuum conditions, testing will be first completed at the component level. During this process, the igniter of the main engine and the RCS thrusters will be tested under a vacuum. To complete the testing of the components, the test setup first needed to be finalized. The CryoCart is being used to feed the propellants to the test article. The CryoCart is a movable test set-up that was developed in 2009 to provide a mobile platform for testing oxygen/methane systems with hot-fire capability up to 100 lbf. The CryoCart consists of three different systems: Oxygen, Methane, and liquid Nitrogen. The Oxygen and Methane systems are placed into two different carts while the liquid nitrogen system is mainly located in the methane cart. Over the years, the CryoCart has been utilized for different projects and has undergone deterioration. For this reason, a new phase has been developed to rebuild it to working conditions once again. During my internship, I was aiding in the construction and restoration of the CryoCart. In the initial stages of the process, I updated the fluid and electrical schematics for the oxygen, methane, and test article systems. The original CryoCart consisted of an electrical panel that utilized electromechanical relays and a terminal to drive the igniter power and signal, as well as the main fuel and oxygen valves. This electrical panel connected to the CryoCart through various wire harnesses that could be found exiting from the CryoCart. First, it was determined how these harnesses connected to the electromechanical relays so that they worked correctly. Once the electrical system was understood, an alternative for the electromechanical relays and the Molex connectors used throughout the system was sought since these components can often prove to be unreliable. Solid State relays and MIL connectors were purchased to serve as replacements. Upon arrival of the parts, crimping and wiring was completed to install the new solid state relays and MIL connectors. During the replacement of the relays and connectors, system checks of the electrical system were ran to ensure that the system was working correctly. While completing system checks, the pressure transducers that were not functioning properly were also replaced and any issue with the wiring or signal was addressed. Once the electrical components were replaced, the restoration of the fluid system began. Parts of the tubing in the CryoCart had to be rebuild and often consisted of sizing, cutting, bending, filing, and sanding the tubing to prepare it to be flared. Many components had to be proof-tested to bring their certifications up to date, and several components had to be replaced. Various flex hoses, valves, and fittings were send to the Clean Lab because they were new, dirty, or had gone through proof-testing. Once they arrived from the cleaning lab they had to be put back to the system and leak checks and functional tests were conducted. In the Nitrogen system, the copper tubing located in the Oxygen cart was rebuild and Aerogel insulation was added to this section. A new gaseous nitrogen system was added to the CryoCart to <b>purge</b> the vacuum <b>tube</b> which will serve as the test chamber. Once the CryoCart was completed, construction of parts of the vacuum tube began. A flange was manufactured with welded fittings to hold the line of the vacuum pump as well as some extra fittings which will serve as extra inlets used to introduce fluid lines to the vacuum tube. Stress analysis was ran in this flange to ensure that it would not fail under vacuum conditions. The fluid lines leading from the air side of the vacuum to the test article were also constructed and added to the mount that had already been manufactured. Three different sets of tubing were constructed to accommodate the seven different RCS thruster and the main engine igniter that are going to be tested. Full electrical system checks were completed to ensure that all the wire harnesses and valves were functioning. Upon the completion of the CryoCart and the vacuum tube, hot fire testing for the RCS thrusters and the main engine igniter are going to begin. During this time any issues encountered with the engines or igniter will be addressed to ensure that the components function under vacuum conditions. After successful completion of testing, the vertical test bed, Morpheus, will be rebuilt and prepared to be sent to Plum Brook. In Plum Brook, the vehicle will be tested in the thermal-vacuum chamber to demonstrate that integrated lox-methane propulsion system operation in space-like conditions. This internship has allowed me the opportunity to gain valuable hands on experience and to develop skills that will aid in my education as well as in the workforce, while at the same time helping me determine that I would like to further pursue a career in propulsion engineering...|$|R
