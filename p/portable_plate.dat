40|$|Summary. Polyclonal {{antibodies}} against {{luteinizing hormone}} in dromedary (camLH) {{were raised in}} a rabbit and enabled the development of homologous immunoassays(radioimmunoassay, competitive enzymeimmunoassay (EIA) and sandwich EIA) for the measurement of circulating camLH in plasma. These assays were highly specific for camLH since neither dromedary follicle-stimulating hormone, growth hormone nor prolactin cross-reacted significantly. The lowest detection limit (0 =. 8 ng/ml) was obtained with the sandwich EIA. In addition to its high specificity and sensitivity, this method does not require radiolabelled molecules or expensive laboratory facilities.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates how countermovement jump (CMJ) kinetic and kinematic variables {{respond to}} three different fatigue protocols {{with the aim}} of identifying variables {{that could be used to}} monitor and detect fatigue induced by phosphocreatine depletion (80 m), metabolite build up (200 m) or glycogen depletion (5 km). Eight amateur rugby union players completed a different fatigue protocols on three different occasions through a counterbalanced repeated measures design. Using a <b>portable</b> force <b>plate,</b> Jump height (JH) peak velocity (PV), peak power (PP), peak force (PF), mean power (MP), mean force (MF), impulse (IM), and mean impulse (MI) were calculated from the best of three CMJ’s immediately before, after and 15 minutes post intervention. The main findings of the present study were (a) JH, PV and PI significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased immediately after all fatigue protocols; (b) JH and PV remained significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased 15 minutes after the 5 km fatigue protocol; (c) PI and PV remained significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased 15 minutes after the 200 m fatigue protocol; (d) MP significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased immediately after the 80 m fatigue protocol. It is suggested that PI, PV and JH could assist in monitoring levels of fatigue after the application of a training stimulus. Changes in PI and PV could be monitored to detect fatigue associated with metabolite build up. Changes in JH and PV could be monitored to detect fatigue associated with glycogen depletion. An indication of the mechanism of fatigue would allow for coaches to prescribe the appropriate loading for training and recovery strategy post match...|$|R
40|$|For the {{determination}} of ground reaction forces in alpine skiing, pressure insole (PI) systems and <b>portable</b> force <b>plate</b> (FP) systems are well known and widely used in previous studies. The {{purposes of this study}} were 1) to provide reference data for the vertical component of the ground reaction forces (vGRF) during alpine skiing measured by the PI and FP systems, and 2) to analyze whether the differences in the vGRF measured by the PI and the FP depend on a skier's level, skiing mode and pitch. Ten expert and ten intermediate level skiers performed 10 double turns with the skiing technique "Carving in Short Radii" as High Dynamic Skiing mode and "Parallel Ski Steering in Long Radii" as Low Dynamic Skiing mode on both the steep (23 °) and the flat (15 °) slope twice. All subjects skied with both the PI and the FP system simultaneously. During the outside phase, the mean vGRF and the maximum vGRF determined by the FP are greater than the PI (p < 0. 01). Additionally during the inside phase, the mean vGRF determined by the FP were greater than the PI (p < 0. 01). During the edge changing phases, the mean vGRF determined by the FP were greater than the PI (p < 0. 01). However, the minimum vGRF during the edge changing phases determined by the FP were smaller than the PI (p < 0. 01) in the High-Steep skiing modes of Experts and Intermediates (p < 0. 001).

Most current clinical optical imaging technologies are accurate and sensitive, but also expensive and difficult to adapt for use in these settings.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to quantify the effects of a warm-up with static or dynamic stretching on countermovement jump height, reaction time, muscle onsets for tibialis anterior (TA) and vastus lateralis (VL), and low back/ hamstring flexibility. METHODS: Twenty one recreationally-active males (24. 4 ± 4. 5 yrs), recruited from the university community, completed 3 data collection sessions. Inclusion criteria were regular participation (30 minutes, 3 days per week) in exercise including resistance training, sprinting, or jumping, and no history of lower extremity injury in the past 6 months. Each session included a 5 minute treadmill jog followed by one of the stretch treatments: no stretching (NS), static stretching (SS), or dynamic stretching (DS). After the general warm-up and treatment, the participant performed a sit-and-reach test to assess low back and hamstring flexibility. Next, the participant completed a series of ten maximal-effort countermovement jumps (CMJ), during which he was asked to jump as quickly as possible after seeing a visual stimulus (light). The onset of movement and CMJ height were determined from force plate data, and muscle onsets (TA and VL) were obtained using surface electromyography (sEMG). Ground reaction forces were recorded at 2000 Hz using a <b>portable</b> force <b>plate,</b> and filtered at 25 Hz. Outcome measures included maximal jump height, reaction time, and muscle onset (TA and VL). A repeated measures 3 (treatment) by 8 (jump) ANOVA was used to assess CMJ height. Additional outcome measures (reaction time, muscle onsets, flexibility) were assessed using separate repeated-measures one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: Results of the 3 x 8 repeated-measures ANOVA for CMJ height revealed a significant main effect of treatment (p=. 004). Post hoc analysis showed significant differences between NS (41. 4 cm) and DS (43. 0 cm) (p=. 0045), and between SS (41. 9 cm) and DS (p=. 0435), but not between NS and SS (p=. 4605). Analysis also revealed a significant main effect of jump (p=. 005) on CMJ height: mean jump height progressively decreased from the early to the late jumps. No significant interaction between treatment and jump was observed (p=. 571). The analysis of reaction time, TA and VL sEMG onsets showed no significant effects. Treatment also had a main effect (p<. 001) on flexibility. Post hoc analysis revealed improved flexibility after both SS (p=. 002) and DS (p<. 001) compared with NS, with no difference in flexibility between the two treatments (p=. 530). CONCLUSION: CMJ height was significantly higher during the DS condition compared to SS and NS, with no difference between NS and SS. Additionally, reaction time and muscle onsets were not influenced by either stretch technique. Athletes in sports requiring lower-extremity power should use dynamic stretching techniques in warm-up to enhance flexibility while improving performance...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To examine {{differences}} between ground-reaction-force (GRF) -based parameters collected from 5 types of plyometric push-ups. Between-trials reliability and {{the relationships between}} parameters were also assessed. Methods: Thirty-seven highly active commando soldiers performed 3 trials of 5 variations of the plyometric push-up in a counterbalanced order: standard countermovement push-up (SCPu), standard squat push-up (SSPu), kneeling countermovement push-up (KCPu), kneeling squat push-up (KSPu), and drop-fall push-up (DFPu). Vertical GRF was measured during these exercises using a <b>portable</b> Kistler force <b>plate.</b> The GRF applied by the hands in the starting position (initial force supported), peak GRF and rate of force development during takeoff, flight time, impact force, and rate of force development impact on landing were determined. Results: During standard-position exercises (SCPu and SSPu) the initial force supported and impact force were higher (P 3 ̆c. 001) than with kneeling exercises (KCPu, KSPu, and DFPu). The peak GRF and rate of force development during takeoff were higher (P 3 ̆c. 001) in the countermovement push-up exercises ([CMP] SCPu, KCPu, and DFPu) than squat push-up exercises ([SP] SSPu and KSPu). Furthermore, the flight time was greater (P 3 ̆c. 001) during kneeling exercises than during standard-position exercises. A significant relationship (P 3 ̆c. 01) between impact force {{and the rate of}} force development impact was observed for CMP and SP exercises (r =. 83 and r =. 62, respectively). The initial force supported was also negatively related (P 3 ̆c. 01) to the flight time for both CMP and SP (r = –. 74 and r = –. 80, respectively).

40|$|Background: High level {{adolescent}} {{female athletes}} in high-impact sports {{may be at}} an increased injury risk due to increased training demands coupled with pubertal growth. Participation longevity in active females requires innovative, holistic research to advance the understanding of injury prevention via longitudinal training response monitoring. Measures of musculoskeletal stiffness (MSS), which model the lower limb as a spring, may provide valuable insight on this issue. MSS {{has been linked to}} both performance and injury through cross-sectional and retrospective study designs. This thesis aimed to longitudinally investigate measures of MSS, jump performance and injury in adolescent females from high-impact, low-impact and non-sporting groups. Methods: Participants from high impact sports (gymnastics, athletics), a low impact sport (water polo), and non-sporting controls were recruited for reliability (n= 16), baseline (n= 113) and longitudinal (n= 83) studies. A range of jump tests were performed on two <b>portable</b> force <b>plates,</b> with a focus on self-paced repeat jumps for the baseline and longitudinal (12 months) studies. MSS was calculated for short (CJb) and long effort (CJb 30) continuous bent-knee repeat jumps; and short effort continuous straight-leg repeat jumps (CJs). Retrospective injury, maturational status, training hours and nutritional habits were surveyed together with injuries during the 12 month test period. Reliability statistics included intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV%), percentage bias (%Bias) and Cohen’s effect size (ES). Baseline and longitudinal statistical analyses included analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) controlling for jump frequency and body mass, linear regression models, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, and logistic regressions. Results: With appropriate data reduction MSS measures used in this thesis indicated acceptable reliability (Intra-Trial: ICC: 0. 98, CV%: 9. 5 - 9. 8 %; Inter-Day: ICC: 0. 66 - 0. 92, CV%: 9. 1 - 15. 2, %Bias: 1. 6 - 16. 7, ES: - 0. 1 - 0. 5). Significant MSS differences were identified between high-impact athletes (e. g. gymnasts: CJs kvert = 24. 16 kN/m, track and field CJs kvert = 25. 52 kN/m) and controls (e. g. CJs kvert = 14. 97 kN/m), with low-impact athletes demonstrating moderate MSS levels (CJs kvert = 20. 26 kN/m). High-impact athletes displayed greater increases in MSS when fatigued. Longitudinally the track and field athletes exhibited increased MSS (19 - 37 %). Whereas gymnasts and water polo players showed little change (- 11. 3 - 7. 7 % and 3. 4 - 15. 9 % respectively) Non-sporting participants had moderate increases (1. 4 - 31. 7 %). Gymnasts and water polo athletes displayed similar longitudinal changes in MSS under fatigue. However, track and field athletes displayed reduced longitudinal MSS increases under fatigue. Prospective injury results indicated high incidence of lower limb musculoskeletal injuries in high-impact athletes. Higher MSS during the CJb and CJs jump tasks significantly predicted 74 % of lower leg and 77 % of overuse injuries respectively. Approximately 87 % of fractures were predicted by bone strength and CJb 30 stiffness change. Although not statistically significant, previous acute injury history and lower CJs stiffness suggested increased acute injury risk. Discussion: Sport-specific differences in MSS measures and jump performance may reflect more effective elastic energy storage and utilization. Stiffness increases under fatigue may enable the maintenance of jump performance, but also place high-impact athletes under increased injury risk. Longitudinal changes in MSS only partially reflected the expected pattern of stiffness change. It’s suggested that increased growth observed in the gymnasts ‘outpaced’ any training effects. Reductions in relative jump performance and stiffness measures may reflect increased growth rather than poor training adaptation. Differences between the jump tasks and participant group results suggest potential sport-specific MSS adjustments. The present results support previous retrospective literature with stress-related overuse injuries predicted by greater levels of stiffness and lower levels of stiffness suggesting acute injury risk. Although the exact mechanisms are unclear, increased forces and loading rates associated with greater stiffness levels may overload the musculoskeletal system and result in overuse injury. In contrast, less stiffness may increase acute injury risk due to increased ranges of motion and poor elastic energy transfer. Conclusions: MSS appears related to jump performance and injury risk in adolescent females which is influenced by sport-specific training. However, a complex interaction between growth, training and MSS appears evident. Coaches {{should be aware of the}} potential impact of growth on training and performance outcomes in adolescent athletes. Specific measures of MSS appear good predictors of lower limb injury in high-impact adolescent athletes. These measures have potential for both talent and injury risk identification within adolescent female highimpact athletes...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of jumper’s knee {{is high in}} sports characterized by high demands on leg extensor speed and power, such as volleyball, basketball, football and athletics. A prevalence up to 50 % has been reported among male, elite volleyball players. The complex process from a healthy tendon to jumper’s knee is not fully understood. Jumper’s knee is usually described as an overuse injury, although previous studies on risk factors are not conclusive. Previous cross-sectional studies among volleyball players have found that athletes with jumper’s knee have higher body mass compared to asymptomatic controls, suggesting a relationship between body composition and jumper’s knee. The “jumper’s knee paradox”, where symptomatic athletes appear to perform better in a counter movement jump (CMJ) compared to asymptomatic controls, is not fully understood. Tendons adapt to mechanical loading, albeit not always adequately. Tendon structural changes from childhood to adulthood are not well investigated, {{and there is a}} need for prospective studies examining the response to intensive training during adolescence. In many athletes with symptoms of jumper’s knee, ultrasound or MRI imaging of the painful tendons will reveal morphological abnormalities, typically as localized tendon thickening with hypoechoic areas and increased vascularity. However, it is not clear whether the presence of ultrasound changes in asymptomatic tendons precede (and predict) future tendon problems. Aims: First, we wanted to study whether training load and competition load as well as body composition or change of body composition represented a risk factor for developing jumper’s knee (Paper I). Furthermore, we wanted to investigate jumping ability and change of jumping ability as potential risk factors for developing jumper’s knee (Paper II). We also wanted to investigate the relationship between the development of ultrasound changes in the patellar and quadriceps tendons and symptoms of jumper’s knee, as well as the medium-term effects of intensive training on tendon thickness among adolescent athletes (Paper III). Methods: Papers I-III were based on a prospective cohort study with a total data collection period of 5 years. All participants were recruited from the same cohort, players entering the Toppvolley Norway (TVN) program, but the time and duration of inclusion differed between participants. TVN is located in Sand, Norway and combines an elite volleyball training program with a three-year senior high boarding school program. All students at TVN were eligible for this study. In Paper I & II only athletes without jumper’s knee at baseline were included, while Paper III also included athletes with pre-existing jumper’s knee. The diagnosis of jumper’s knee was based on a clinical examination alone. All athletes were examined twice a year. Training volume and match exposure were recorded prospectively on a weekly basis. Body composition was assessed by measuring height and weight, waist circumference and through skin fold caliper tests. Jumping ability was tested on a <b>portable</b> force <b>plate</b> and included two different jumps (CMJ and standing jump (SJ)). An ultrasound examination was done twice a year as long as students remained at TVN using greyscale and color Doppler. Main results: Altogether, 192 students were registered in the school record at TVN during the 5 -year study period. Nearly one in three boys developed jumper’s knee during their time at TVN (32 %) compared to only 8 % of the girls (Paper I). Paper I: Athletes developing jumper’s knee had higher total training volume and tendon load compared to those who remained asymptomatic. A multivariate regression analysis showed that match exposure was the strongest sports-related predictor for developing jumper’s knee with an OR of 3. 88 (95 % CI 1. 80 to 8. 40) for every extra set played per week. Volleyball training had an OR 1. 72, (95 % CI 1. 18 to 2. 53) when combined with match exposure and gender. We did not detect any significant differences in body composition at the time of inclusion or change of body composition during the study period between players who developed jumper's knee and those who did not developed jumper’s knee. Males had three to four times higher risk of developing jumper’s knee compared to females, independent on training and match exposure in the multivariate regression analysis. Paper II: At the time of inclusion, male athletes who went on to develop jumper’s knee had significantly better results in CMJ (38. 0 ± 5. 8 cm) compared to asymptomatic males (34. 6 ± 5. 5 cm, p= 0. 03), while no difference was detected in SJ. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis corrected for gender and previous volleyball training, the OR was 2. 09 (1. 03 to 4. 25) per cm difference in CMJ at the time of inclusion. Our results did not reveal any significant differences in the change in jumping ability between the groups, although both groups improved their jumping performance. Paper III: About half of the asymptomatic athletes who went on to develop jumper’s knee (17 of 35 tendons) had hypoechoic areas when they started at TVN, while 10 % of the tendons that remained asymptomatic (24 of 238 tendons) had the same changes. Neovascularisation was found in 4 % (9 of 238 tendons) of asymptomatic tendons and in 48 % (15 of 35 tendons) of those who later developed jumper’s knee. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, a baseline finding of a hypoechoic tendon area (OR 3. 3, 95 % CI 1. 1 to 9. 2) and neovascularisation (OR 2. 7, 95 % CI 1. 1 to 6. 5) increased the risk of developing jumper’s knee. Patellar tendon thickness among healthy athletes did not change (Wilk’s lambda, p= 0. 07) while quadriceps tendon thickness increased (p= 0. 001). The athletes reported a VISA score of 72 (SD 23) when first diagnosed, and knee function did not change during subsequent examinations and was 73 (SD 21) when they left TVN. Conclusion: A high volume of volleyball training and match exposure were important risk factors for developing jumper’s knee. Body composition or change in body composition were not associated with injury risk. Volleyball players with a natural ability for jumping high have an increased risk of developing jumper’s knee, while change in jumping ability was not identified as a risk factor. Hypoechoic areas and neovascularisation at baseline were risk factors for developing jumper’s knee. Quadriceps tendon thickness increased 7 - 11 % among healthy athletes, while there was no change in patellar tendon thickness. </p...|$|R
