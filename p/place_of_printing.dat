Today’s college {{students}} rely on digital devices to socialize, organize, {{and search for}} information.

As CS 101 instructors at the University of Hawaii at Hilo consider adapting traditional print resources to digital format, this research project aims to determine effective design and implementation strategies. An interactive e-textbook was developed using iBooks Author with a variety of widgets added to maximize interactivity, learning, motivation and engagement.

50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{reference}} to Whytchurch and the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>printing,</b> this statement agrees with that of Simeon Ruytinck, {{and it is possible}} that Van Meteren showed his zeal in the matter by undertaking the cost of printing the work {{as well as that of}} remunerating the translator. Mr W. Aldis Wright, however, judging from the facts that the name of Whytchurch was introduced, that the places of printing were given as London and Paris, not Antwerp, and lastly that Emanuel van Meteren being born in 1535 could only have derived his knowledge from hearsay, is inclined to think that the Bible in which J. van Meteren was interested “was Matthew's of 1537 or the Great Bible of 1539, and not Coverdale's of 1535”.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the problem of {{cultural}} films. Screening cultural films was made compulsory by the Film Law (1939), the first cultural law in Japan, and these films were put on the screen for only 10 minutes. Through cultural media policies, the government intended to use films as entertainment media to easily and unpainfully raise public cultural awareness. In other words, films were expected to take the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>print</b> media. It is no exaggeration, therefore, to say that the government's intention was to initiate an educational revolution from print media to visual media. However, the effect was contrary to their intention. Cultural films produced then were boring, perhaps an inevitability considering their short length of only 10 minutes As a result, audience response was cold. Having willingly gone to the theater for fun, the audience was turned off by the boring films and would vacate the theater when their screening began. Suffice it to say that the government learned that the aim of integrating enlightenment and entertainment was not easily achievable...|$|R
