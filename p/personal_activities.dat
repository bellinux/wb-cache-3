A Polonized nobleman from an old Ukrainian family, he adopted the Ukrainian {{language}} and a Ukrainophile orientation. Although Sheptytsky did not interfere in priests' <b>personal</b> <b>activities</b> and writings, he slowly purged the Church's hierarchy of Russophiles. Despite drawing some Ukrainophiles' criticism for the slow progression of his changes, under Sheptytsky's leadership the Church gradually ceased being a bastion of Russophilism and instead became a staunchly Ukrainophile one.|$|E
25|$|Damien Rice (born 7 December 1973) is an Irish singer-songwriter, {{musician}} and record producer. Rice began his musical {{career as a}} member of the 1990s rock group Juniper, which were signed to Polygram Records in 1997. The band enjoyed moderate success with a couple of single releases, but a projected album floundered because of record company politics. After leaving the band he worked as a farmer in Tuscany and busked throughout Europe before returning to Ireland in 2001 and beginning a solo musical career, and the rest of the band went on to become Bell X1. In 2002 his debut album O reached No. 8 on the UK albums chart, won the Shortlist Music Prize and generated three top-30 singles in the UK. Rice released his second album 9 in 2006 and his songs have appeared in numerous films and television episodes. After eight years of various collaborations, Rice released his third studio album My Favourite Faded Fantasy on 31 October 2014. Rice's <b>personal</b> <b>activities</b> include musical contributions to charitable projects such as the , Freedom Campaign and the Enough Project.|$|E

Salvador Brau, a historian and close friend, later wrote that once Betances returned to Puerto Rico with Lita's body, he suspended all <b>personal</b> <b>activities</b> besides his medical work, spent {{a considerable amount of}} time caring for her tomb at the Mayagüez cemetery, and assumed the physical aspect that most people identify Betances with: dark suit, long unkempt beard, and [...] "Quaker" [...] hat.|$|E
500|$|Ed Greenwood {{began writing}} {{stories about the}} Forgotten Realms as a child, {{starting}} around 1967; they were his [...] "dream space for swords and sorcery stories". Greenwood {{came up with the}} Forgotten Realms name from the notion of a multiverse of parallel worlds; Earth is one such world, and the Realms another. In Greenwood's original conception, the fantastic legends of Earth derive from a fantasy world, the way to which has been lost. Greenwood discovered the Dungeons & Dragons game in 1975, and became a serious role-playing enthusiast with the first AD game releases in 1978. The setting became the home of Greenwood's personal campaign. Greenwood began a Realms campaign in the city of Waterdeep, then started another group known as the Knights of Myth Drannor in Shadowdale. Greenwood felt that his players' thirst for detail made the Realms what it is: [...] "They want it to seem real, and work on ‘honest jobs’ and <b>personal</b> <b>activities,</b> until the whole thing grows into far more than a casual campaign. Roleplaying always governs over rules, and the adventures seem to develop themselves." [...] Greenwood has stated that his own version of the Forgotten Realms, as run in his personal campaign, is much darker than published versions.|$|E

500|$|Russian {{psychiatrist}} Fedor Kondratev {{not only}} denied accusations {{that he was}} ever personally engaged in Soviet abuses of psychiatry; he stated publicly that the very conception {{of the existence of}} Soviet-era [...] "punitive psychiatry" [...] was nothing more than: [...] "the fantasy [...] of the very same people who are now defending totalitarian sects. This is slander, which was [...] used for anti-Soviet ends, but is now being used for anti-Russian ends." [...] He says that there were attempts to use of psychiatry for political purposes but there was no mass psychiatric terror, he calls allegations about the terror a propagandistic weapon of activists of the Cold War. As Alexander Podrabinek writes, psychiatrists of punitive conscription and namely Kondratev are relatively indifferent to the public's indignation over illegal use of psychiatry both in Soviet times and now, they do not notice this public, allowing themselves to ignore any unprofessional opinion. In response to the article by Podrabinek, Kondratev instituted a suit against Podrabinek under Russian Civil Code Article 152 on protecting one's honor, dignity and business reputation. According to Valery Krasnov and Isaak Gurovich, official representatives of psychiatry involved in its political abuse never acknowledged the groundlessness of their diagnostics and actions. The absence of the acknowledgement and the absence of an analysis of made errors cast a shadow upon all psychiatrists in the USSR and, especially, in Russia. As Russian-American historian Georgi Chernyavsky writes, {{after the fall of the}} communist regime, no matter how some psychiatrists lean over backwards, foaming at the mouth to this day when stating that they were slandered, that they did not give dissidents diagnoses-sentences, or that, at least, these cases were isolated and not at all related to their <b>personal</b> <b>activities,</b> no matter how the doctors, if one may call them so, try to rebut hundreds if not thousands of real facts, it is undoable.|$|E

After personal hygiene and morning clean-up, recruits will perform physical training (only on Monday through Saturday). After the morning meal, the recruits begin the day's scheduled training, which may include classes, drill or martial arts. On Sundays, recruits are offered {{the morning to}} attend various religious services and personal time (often called [...] "Square-Away Time"). After the noon meal, the day's training continues until the evening meal, typically around 17:00 to 18:00 (5:00 to 6:00pm). After this time, recruits will have hygiene time to shower, clean their weapons and clean their barracks. Recruits also get roughly 1 hour of square away time after this, personal time for recruits to engage in <b>personal</b> <b>activities</b> such as preparing uniforms or equipment, writing letters, working out or doing laundry. Recruits are not free from their Drill Instructors (DIs) or allowed to leave the squad bay during this time. In preparation to sleep, recruits may hydrate, pray together for five minutes, ensure footlockers and rifles are locked and often recite the Rifleman's Creed or Marines' Hymn before lights-out. Lights-out can range from 20:00 to 22:00 (8:00 to 10:00pm), depending on the next day's activities.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} {{study was to investigate}} whether <b>personal</b> creative <b>activity</b> predicted perceived stress in men living with a chronic physical illness. <b>Personal</b> creative <b>activity</b> was measured with the Creative Achievement Questionnaire (Carson, Peterson, & Higgins, 2005), select questions from the Flow Questionnaire (Collins, 2006), the Everyday Creativity Questionnaire (Ivcevic & Mayer, 2009) and the Creative Behaviour Inventory (Hocevar, 1979). Perceived stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983). Sequential Multiple Regression was used to assess the relationship between <b>personal</b> creative <b>activity</b> and perceived stress levels of males with chronic illness. It was hypothesized {{that there would be a}} negative relationship between men&# 8223;s <b>personal</b> creative <b>activity</b> involvement and their perceived level of stress; that is, higher <b>personal</b> creative <b>activity</b> scores would be associated with lower perceived stress levels. This relationship was expected to be demonstrated by all men regardless of their diagnosis. Participants included 139 males with chronic illness (mean age: 50 years). Findings indicated that <b>personal</b> creative <b>activity</b> was not related to perceived stress. However the participants reported being involved in many different <b>personal</b> creative <b>activities</b> not included in the four creative measures, which may help explain the low scores on the creativity measures that may have skewed the data and resulted in low correlations. Age and number of symptoms were related to perceived stress. As the participants aged, their perceived stress decreased; and the more symptoms they reported, the higher their perceived stress. The strengths and limitations of the current study are outlined, along with implications for future research and practice. Future research is needed to further examine the relationship between creativity and perceived stress in men with chronic illness as well as to develop creativity measures that include more male-oriented activities...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} growth in the deployment of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in the supply chain in the recent years. Since RFID requires less cost and infrastructure than the sensor networks such as Ultrasonic or Wi-Fi, it {{has been a}}pplied in many business and research domains. The major applications of RFID technology include location position, object tracking and activity monitoring. Particularly in the individual activity monitoring circumstance, it is expected that by detecting the object with which the person interacted, the related personal movement is able to be recognized. However, the inherent unreliability of RFID data results in the uncertainty of the RFID detection of activity. This research estimates the accuracy of using RFID detection records to monitor <b>personal</b> <b>activity</b> in an assisted living context. The methodology for this research is a quantitative approach by using design science. Two real experiments are conducted for performing activity monitoring in a laboratory environment. Both experiment results show that false positive reads have a serious influence on the accuracy of detecting individual motion. In order to remove the noisy data from the original RFID data stream, the multi-level data pre-processing method is used and analysed in the research. The cleaned dataset shows the perfect accuracy of <b>personal</b> <b>activity</b> inference. Although this proposed method is efficient for filtering the noisy data and predicting the correct individual movement in this research, it only focuses on recognizing the regular <b>personal</b> <b>activity</b> in a clean indoor environment. Due to the complexity of human indoor behaviour, future exploration needs to be carried out in other different environmental backgrounds...|$|R
