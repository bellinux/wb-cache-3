25|$|Like {{sailplanes}} {{and hang}} gliders, paragliders use rising air (thermals) or ridge lift to gain height. This {{process is the}} basis for most recreational flights and competitions, though aerobatics and 'spot landing competitions' also occur. Launching is often done by jogging down a slope, but winch launches behind a towing vehicle are also used. A Paramotor is a <b>paraglider</b> wing <b>powered</b> by a motor attached {{to the back of the}} pilot, and is also known as a <b>powered</b> <b>paragliders.</b> A variation of this is the paraplane, which has a motor mounted on a wheeled frame rather than the pilot's back.|$|R
50|$|In November 2015, it was {{announced}} that the National Crime Scene Cleanup Association, along with scientist J. Marvin Herndon and documentary filmmaker, Michael J. Murphy, were to set out in 2016 to obtain test samples from the phenomenon known as 'Chem Trails'. The testing requires a pair of pilots from the National Crime Scene Cleanup Association, to fly up in <b>powered</b> <b>paragliders,</b> and use testing equipment to determine the presence of any unnatural chemicals or pathogens. All tests were to be verified by Dr Herndon, as well as documented by Michael J. Murphy, to be released as a feature at a later date.|$|R
