60|$|Now, {{with regard}} to this substance, {{let me tell you}} briefly how we get it. The process used to be this. The ore which I shewed you just now was taken, and digested in nitro-muriatic acid of a certain strength, and partly {{converted}} into a solution, with the leaving behind of certain bodies that I have upon the table. The platinum being dissolved with care in acids, to the solution the muriate of ammonia was added, as I am about to add it here. A yellow precipitate was then thrown down, as you perceive is the case now; and this, carefully washed and cleansed, gave us that body [pointing to a specimen of the chloride of platinum and ammonium], the other elements, or nearly all, being ejected. This substance being heated, gave us what we call <b>platinum</b> <b>sponge,</b> or platinum in the metallic state, so finely divided as to form a kind of heavy mass or sponge, which, at the time that Dr. Wollaston first sent it forth, was not fusible for the market or in the manufacturers' workshops, inasmuch as the temperature required was so high, and there were no furnaces that could bring the mass into a globule, and cause the parts to adhere together. Most of our metals that we obtain from nature, and work in our shops, are brought at last into a mass by fusion. I am not aware that there is in the arts or sciences any other than iron which is not so. Soft iron we do not bring together by fusion, but by a process which is analogous to the one that was followed in the case of platinum, namely, welding; for these divided grains of spongy platinum having been well washed and sunk in water for the purpose of excluding air, and pressed together, and heated, and hammered, and pressed again, until they come into a pretty close, dense, compact mass, did so cohere, that when the mass was put into the furnace of charcoal, and raised to a high temperature, the particles, at first infinitely divided--for they were chemically divided--adhered the one to the other, each to all the rest, until they made that kind of substance which you see here, which will bear rolling and expansion of every kind. No other process than that has hitherto been adopted for the purpose of obtaining this substance from the particles by solution, precipitation, ignition, and welding. It certainly is a very fine thing to see that we may so fully depend upon the properties of the various substances we have to deal with; that we can, by carrying out our processes, obtain a material like this, allowing of division and extension under a rolling mill--a material of the finest possible kind, the parts being held together, not with interstices, not with porosity, but so continuous that no fluids can pass between them; and, as Dr. Wollaston beautifully shewed, a globule of platinum fused by the voltaic battery and the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe, when drawn into a wire, was not sounder or stronger than this wire made by the curious coalescence of the particles by the sticking power that they had at high temperatures. This is the process adopted by Messrs. Johnson and Matthey, to whose great kindness I am indebted for these ingots and for the valuable assistance I have received in the illustrations.|$|E

40|$|An {{extensive}} reveiw of the {{platinum group metal}} fluorides {{has been}} carried out and in the light of this, new preparative routes have been developed and characterisation has been significantly improved. The preparation of the platinum group metal fluorides in both static and dynamic systems is discussed in chapter two. The fluorinations of ruthenium, rhodium and <b>platinum</b> <b>sponges</b> in dynamic systems proved to be of greatest interest. In these studies large amounts of ruthenium hexafluoride and platinum hexafluoride were produced and traces of rhodium hexafluoride were noted, where as previously more forcing conditions had been employed in the preparation of these compounds. It is believed that rigorous drying of the flow line and hydrogenation of the metal in situ are responsible for the success of this new preparative route. When ruthenium is fluorinated in the dynamic system ruthenium hexafluoride and tetrameric ruthenium pentafluoride are produced in large quantities, and smaller amounts of a red glassy material is also formed. There have been no previous reports of any red material forming during this reaction. It is now believed that this material is a trimeric form of ruthenium pentafluoride. The charaterisation of these fluorides was carried out using a large variety of techniques, the most useful being mass spectrometry and matrix isolated infrared spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry proved invaluble in the characterisation of the trimeric ruthenium pentafluoride, while matrix isolation enabled good quality infrared spectra of the reactive hexafluorides to be recorded. These techniques were also utilised to give the first insight into the behaviour of the tetrameric pentafluorides in the gas phase. Iridium pentafluoride {{has been shown to be}} monomeric at elevated temperatures, under similar conditions ruthenium and osmium pentafluorides decompose to the metal and fluorine. Platinum pentafluoride is known to be unstable at room temperature and thought to decompose to the hexafluoride and tetrafluoride. Using matrix isolation, direct evidence of this has been obtained...|$|R

The hydrogen is led over a <b>platinum</b> <b>sponge</b> catalyst, where it reacts with air oxygen, heats the catalyst and ignites from it, producing a gentle flame.

5000|$|Döbereiner's lamp, {{also called}} a [...] "tinderbox" [...] ("Feuerzeug"), is a lighter invented in 1823 by the German chemist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner; the lighter {{is based on}} the Fürstenberger lighter and was in {{production}} until ca. 1880. In the jar, similar to the Kipp's apparatus, zinc metal reacts with dilute sulfuric acid to produce hydrogen gas. When a valve is opened, a jet of hydrogen is released onto a <b>platinum</b> <b>sponge.</b> The sponge catalyzes reaction with atmospheric oxygen, which heats the catalyst and ignites the hydrogen, producing a gentle flame.|$|E
5000|$|Generally speaking, {{anything}} {{that increases the}} rate of a process is a [...] "catalyst", a term derived from Greek , meaning [...] "to annul," [...] or [...] "to untie," [...] or [...] "to pick up." [...] The concept of catalysis was invented by chemist Elizabeth Fulhame and described in a 1794 book, based on her novel work in oxidation-reduction experiments. The term catalysis was later used by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in 1835 to describe reactions that are accelerated by substances that remain unchanged after the reaction. Fulhame, who predated Berzelius, did work with water as opposed to metals in her reduction experiments. Other 18th century chemists who worked in catalysis were Eilhard Mitscherlich who {{referred to it as}} contact processes, and Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner who spoke of contact action. He developed Döbereiner's lamp, a lighter based on hydrogen and a <b>platinum</b> <b>sponge,</b> which became a commercial success in the 1820s that lives on today. Humphry Davy discovered the use of platinum in catalysis. In the 1880s, Wilhelm Ostwald at Leipzig University started a systematic investigation into reactions that were catalyzed by the presence of acids and bases, and found that chemical reactions occur at finite rates and that these rates can be used to determine the strengths of acids and bases. For this work, Ostwald was awarded the 1909 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.|$|E
40|$|The {{low-temperature}} deactivation of a <b>platinum</b> <b>sponge</b> catalyst {{used for}} ammonia oxidation was studied with the positron emission profiling technique (PEP). Evidence that irreversibly adsorbed nitrogen species deactivate the catalyst is presented. Two reactivity regimes are distinguished. Initial fast N 2 production at low surface coverage and a relatively slow N 2 and N 2 O production at steady state when {{the surface is}} fully covered. The fast deactivation of the <b>platinum</b> <b>sponge</b> is mainly caused by adsorbed nitrogen species. The formation of PtO is relatively slow compared to surface nitride.

Adsorbed NO {{appears to be an}} important intermediate, while its formation strongly depends on the oxygen surface coverage. Temperature-programmed experiments are performed to characterize the adsorbed nitrogen species. Furthermore, H 2, NH 3, and NO are used to react with these adsorbed nitrogen species.

40|$|The {{activity}} of iridium and <b>platinum</b> <b>sponge</b> catalysts was {{studied in the}} low temperature gas phase oxidation of ammonia with oxygen. Under the reaction conditions used, iridium {{was found to be}} more active and more selective to nitrogen than platinum. Furthermore it was established from activity measurements that both catalysts lose activity as a function of time on stream due to inhibition of the surface by reaction intermediates. The used catalysts were studied with XPS and temperature programmed techniques. It was found that the surface of the catalysts had a high coverage of NH and OH and some additional NH 2. It seems most likely that the reaction mechanism proceeds through a stepwise dehydrogenation of the ammonia molecule. It appears that the last dehydrogenation step (NH by OH to N and water) is the rate determining step. The high selectivity of iridium to nitrogen {{can be explained by the}} higher {{activity of}} iridium in dissociating NO...|$|E
30|$|US Patent Nos. 6827837 B 2 (2004) and 0056548 A 1 (2005) {{released}} {{a method for}} the recovering of gold and one and more platinum group elements, such as platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium and iridium, from CFA. In this method an ash formed by the combustion of a pre-selected coal is mixed with the ash contains gold and one more platinum group of elements, an inquart containing gold and one or more platinum group elements, and fluxing agent to form a ‘charge’. The ‘charge’ is then heated in a furnace to a preselected temperature and forming a molten charge including a molten inquart; absorbing {{a portion of the}} gold and more platinum group elements of the ash into the molten inquart. Casting a dare bar (which contains gold and one or more platinum group elements) by discharging the molten inquart. Digesting the dore bar in an elctrowinning process where the dore bar is introduced as an anode in an acidic bath and an electrical potential is maintained between the cathode and anode, then precipitating and dissolving trace elements in the electrolytic solution producing an anode slime. The digestion of anode slimes is done using 30  % solution of HNO 3. The digestion is filtered and rinsed then the liquid rinsed portion containing Ag in solution is washed with HCl and filtered. The residue is mixed with aqua regia, forming a solution containing gold, platinum and palladium. Gold may then be removed by solvent extraction. Rhodium and other metals may be removed by precipitation by the treatment of the solution with potassium hydroxide and sodium borohydrite. Palladium in solution may be removed by precipitation by treatment with ammonium hydroxide, NH 4 OH, and HCl as the complex PdCl 2 (NH 3) 2. Alternatively, Pd in solution is removed by precipitation with DiMethyl Glyxime, followed by filtration and reduction and ashing of the residue. Platinum in solution is removed by any of the accepted methods including precipitation as impure (NH 4) 2 PtCl 6 after treatment with NH 4 Cl, or leaching H 2 PdCl 4 from solution. An organic solvent such as DiMethyl Glyoxime is used to extract gold, after treatment with NH 4 Cl, the solution should also be treated with ethanol and hydrogen peroxide. The solution is filtered and the residue, including (NH 4) 2 PtCl 6, subjected to reduction and burning leaving an impure <b>platinum</b> <b>sponge.</b> The <b>platinum</b> <b>sponge</b> can be purified by redissolving in aqua-regia. This method is very complex, and a recovery and purity level is not mentioned.|$|E
