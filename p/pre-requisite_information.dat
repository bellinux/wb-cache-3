40|$|Purpose: Diagnostic Imaging Pathways (DIP) is an ‘on-line’ evidencebased {{decision}} support tool ([URL] {{that was developed}} at Royal Perth Hospital (RPH) to facilitate appropriate diagnostic imaging requesting behaviour amongst clinicians. This study aims to evaluate compliance of diagnostic imaging requests to recommendations outlined in DIP and reasons for non-compliance. Methods and materials: Retrospective audits, followed by intervention and re-audits were {{carried out in the}} Emergency Department (ED). Pathways targeted were: ‘Suspected Pulmonary Embolism’, ‘Ankle Injury’ ‘Suspected Renal Colic’ and ‘Non Traumatic Acute Abdominal Pain’. Interventions included: regular reminders to staff to refer to DIP, education on DIP recommendations, introduction of request forms detailing “proof” of adherence to pathways, and refusal of inappropriate examinations. Results: In the initial audits (N  658), 285 (43 %) received imaging of doubtful appropriateness whilst 158 (24 %) received examinations without indications. Follow-up audits demonstrate only partial improvements in compliance. Requesters failed to follow recommendations for many reasons including: insufficient time to learn about recommendations; disbelief in their validity; failure to understand the importance of adhering to recommendations. Requesters may provide inaccurate <b>pre-requisite</b> <b>information</b> or ‘pressurise’ providers to accept a request without pre-requisites. Providers fail in their ‘gatekeeper’ function because of insufficient time to deliver education, difficulty obtaining <b>pre-requisite</b> <b>information,</b> and reluctance to resist a demand. Conclusion: Targeted interventions were only partially successful in eliminating non-compliance with evidence-based pathways (DIP) amongst clinicians in this study. Future investigations should examine the extent to which information-communication technology linked to electronic ordering of imaging can suppress inappropriate practice...|$|E

40|$|Data {{collected}} from street-vended food enterprises and on vendors in west African countries revealed that, {{they provide a}} variety of ready-to-eat foods to {{a high proportion of}} the populations. Nevertheless, their handling and trading practices are not permit to obtain safe food. While, street-vended foods are easily contaminated by food borne pathogen and others chemicals compounds. The street-vended foods contamination mechanisms were identified and improvement pathways were suggested. Indeed, Food Safety Objective (FSO) concept developed by FAO and WHO, can be used as ideal strategy for safe street food production. However, to reach this goal, the Critical Control Points (CCP), Microbiological and Risks Assessment (MRA), and hygienic status during street food production and sale were gathered. By assembling and analyzing the data, the safety assurance for safe street food obtaining was evaluated at every step of production chain. The data were juxtaposed to FSO concept frame work and applied along the street-vended food production chain. We applied Performance Objective (PO) and Control Measure (CM) respectively at operational levels, measure at relevant points of risk and points, that permit reduction of all contamination risks along the chain, to enhancing safe food obtaining. The FSO concept could help government to elaborate guidance for street foods production, vending and consumption, producers and vendors, training about HACCP <b>pre-requisites</b> and <b>information</b> for global view on safe street-vended food (SSF) production. This will be an important task for the primary health care system aiming at `health for all`...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) are the {{two most}} {{important}} anthropogenic greenhouse gases. The near-infrared nadir spectra of reflected solar radiation measured by SCIAMACHY on-board ENVISAT contain information on the vertical columns of these gases which we retrieve using {{a new version of the}} scientific algorithm WFM-DOAS (version 1. 0). Our main data products are column-averaged dry air mole fractions (XCO 2 in ppm and XCH 4 in ppb) determined by simultaneous measure-ments of the dry air mass obtained from oxygen (O 2) for carbon dioxide and CO 2 for methane. The SCIAMACHY data set is unique because of the high sensitivity of the near-infrared measurements with respect to concentration changes in the atmospheric boundary layer.

40|$|Background: An ‘on-line’ {{application}} called Diagnostic Imaging Pathways (DIP) {{was developed}} at Royal Perth Hospital (RPH), Western Australia. DIP is an evidence-based decision support tool designed to assist clinicians to request {{the most appropriate}} examinations to achieve a diagnosis. The application is accessed from the ‘desk-top’ and the Internet (www. imagingpathways. health. wa. gov. au). Clinicians at RPH are regularly alerted to the desirability of complying to DIP recommendations. Purpose: To evaluate compliance between diagnostic imaging requests and recommendations in DIP.

40|$|Objectives: Evaluate {{compliance}} {{of diagnostic}} imaging requests with imaging pathways and reasons for non-compliance. Methods: An ‘on-line’ evidence-based decision support tool called Diagnostic Imaging Pathways (DIP) was developed at Royal Perth Hospital (RPH) to assist clinicians request {{the most appropriate}} examinations and in the best sequence to achieve a diagnosis. DIP is accessed from the ‘desk-top’ and the Internet (www. imagingpathways. health. wa. gov. au). Clinicians at RPH are regularly alerted to the desirability of complying with DIP recommendations at the ‘Grand Round’, in the medical newsletter and in the orientation and induction programme of junior doctors. Retrospective audits targeting four pathways (‘Suspected Pulmonary Embolism’ N= 187, ‘Ankle Injury’ N= 149, ‘Suspected Renal Colic’ N= 89, ‘Non-Traumatic Acute Abdominal Pain’ N= 213), followed by intervention and re-audits (N= 109, N= 116, N= 113, N= 94 respectively) were carried out on all referrals from the Emergency Department (ED) over defined periods. Request forms and medical records were reviewed {{and the proportion of}} patients receiving non-compliant examinations was documented. Interventions included education of ED clinicians on DIP recommendations, introduction of request forms requiring ‘proof’ of adherence to pathways, and refusal of inappropriate requests. Findings: In the initial audits (N= 638), there were 347 (54 %) incidences on non-compliance with the recommended pathway. In the re-audits (N= 432), inappropriate incidences were 132 (31 %). Requesters failed to follow recommendations for many reasons including; insufficient time to learn about recommendations, disbelief in their validity, and not understanding the importance of adhering to recommendations. Requesters then provided inaccurate <b>pre-requisite</b> <b>information</b> or ‘pressurised’ providers to accept a request without pre-requisites. Providers failed in their ‘gatekeeper’ function because of insufficient time to deliver education, difficulty obtaining <b>pre-requisite</b> <b>information,</b> and reluctance to resist a demand. Discussion: Prior to the initial audits, the easy availability and active marketing of DIP within RPH had not eliminated inappropriate diagnostic imaging. Re-audits showed that targeted interventions improved compliance but did not eliminate inappropriate imaging. The delivery of decision support to clinicians must be improved. DIP needs to be embedded in the clinical decision workflow if maximum and sustained reduction of inappropriate imaging is to be achieved. It is envisaged that the best approach is to convert the current paper-based referral processes to an electronic process (Electronic Order Entry - EOE) and to progressively link EOE to decision support afforded by DIP. In the process of completing an electronic order, requesters would be alerted to the need to provide prerequisite information and would not need to access DIP as an extra step or to remember the recommendations. Providers would not need to continuously deliver education or to obtain <b>pre-requisite</b> <b>information</b> at difficult stages in the clinical workflow, and would be alerted to the need for a consultation.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of inherited cancer-susceptibility syndromes can enable identifi cation of individuals {{at increased risk}} for early-onset cancer. The treatment and prognosis of patients diagnosed with malignancy due to a germ-line mutation may differ from the standard therapy. Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) syndrome are the two most important syndromes responsible for inherited cancers in gynaecology. Genetic testing is available for both these syndromes. BRCA testing is affordable and easy in South Africa for patients with Afrikaner or Ashkenazi ancestry, as the mutation patterns are known. Women’s health care clinicians must be well informed about these cancer syndromes. Families with a potential genetic mutation should be identifi ed and referred for investigation or counselled for genetic testing. Counselling <b>pre-requisites</b> include complete <b>information</b> about the disease, genetic tests, estimated cancer risk and cancer risk management. Individualised cancer risk can be estimated based on genetic and/or clinical information. Breast, endometrial and ovarian cancers are potentially either preventable or qualify for early detection through advanced screening techniques. Surgical and hormonal prevention is effective, but has important economic, psychosocial and clinical implications. Early detection techniques offer less protection and a smaller improvement in morbidity and mortality. Screening is also a costly option but may be more acceptable to some patients. In colon cancer syndromes, the risk for endometrial and ovarian cancer is much elevated. These risks should be recognised and addressed, as these diseases are easy to prevent...|$|R
40|$|The {{conditions}} for the third, non-profit sector, such as grassroots organisations and trade unions, have changed dramatically in recent years, due to prevailing social trends. Non-profit organisations {{have been seen as}} early adopters of information technology, but the area is, at the same time, largely unattended by scientific research. Meanwhile, the field of information systems development is, to an increasing extent, recognising the importance of user involvement in the design process. Nevertheless, participatory development approaches, such as Participatory Design are not suited to the context of entire organisations, and new, networked organisational structures, such as those of non-profit organisations. This reasoning also applies to the theoretical framework of Activity Theory, whose potential benefits for systems development have been acclaimed but less often tried in practice. This thesis aims, first, at extending Participatory Design to use in large, particularly non-profit organisations. This aim is partly achieved by integrating Participatory Design with an Argumentative Design approach and with the application of Activity Theory modified for an organisational context. The purpose is to obtain reasoning about and foreseeing the consequences of different design solutions. Second, the thesis aims at exploring information technology needs, solutions, and consequences in non-profit organisations, in trade unions in particular. The case under study is the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO) and the design of an information system for its 250 000 shop stewards. The thesis is based on six related studies complemented with data from work in a local design group working according to the principles of Participatory Design. The first study was aimed at investigating and comparing trade union management’s view of the new technology and the actual needs of shop stewards. The second study investigated the situation, tasks and problems of shop stewards, as a <b>pre-requisite</b> for finding <b>information</b> technology needs. The third study merged the previous findings into an argumentative design of an information systems design proposal. The fourth study collected the voices from secondary user groups in the organisation, and presented an Activity theoretical analysis of the union organisation and a modified design proposal {{in the form of a}} prototype. The fifth study presented an Activity theoretical framework, modified for organisational application, and used it for producing hypotheses on possible shop steward tasks and organisational consequences of the implementation of the information system. The sixth paper was aimed at the initial testing of the hypotheses, through the evaluation of information technology facilities in one of the individual union affiliations. The complementary data was used to propose further modifications of the integrated Participatory, Argumentative, and Activity Theory design approach. The major contributions of the study are, first, a modified Participatory Design approach to be applied at three levels; in general as a way of overcoming experienced difficulties with the original approach, in the context of entire, large organisations, and in the specific non-profit organisation context. The second contribution is generated knowledge in the new research area of information technology in the non-profit, trade union context, where for instance the presented prototype can be seen as a source of inspiration. Future research directions include further development and formalisation of the integrated Participatory Design approach, as well as actual consequences of implementing information technology in non-profit organisations and trade unions.

40|$|ALICE (Adaptive Learning for Interdisciplinary Collaborative Environments) is an {{open-source}} {{web based}} adaptive learning system designed for interdisciplinary instruction. ALICE {{has the potential}} to transform education by empowering transdisciplinary knowledge acquisition. This is particularly important in fields that accept newcomers with diverse scholastic backgrounds, e. g. Systems Biology. With traditional interdisciplinary instruction, the instructor must cover <b>pre-requisite</b> <b>information</b> from multiple disciplines to ensure all students begin at a common baseline - slowing the learning process. With ALICE, students follow a personalized syllabus based on their previous knowledge and work towards individual goals. Implementing an adaptive learning system in an interdisciplinary course requires careful considerations of the instructional design. Structuring material, formulating assessments, and other instructional design aspects must be carefully considered. These considerations are detailed through the exploration of a case study implementing ALICE in a graduate level Systems Biology course. Comment: 17 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|Abstract from public. pdf file. Dissertation supervisors: Drs. John Budd and Denice Adkins. Includes vita. The nursing {{profession}} is evolving from basing patient care on tradition and expert opinion to emphasizing evidence based practice. Literature suggests that nurses {{do not have}} the information literacy skills required for evidence based practice, and that they have neither adequate instruction nor the experience needed to effectively, efficiently, and ethically find the information that they need. To help meet this need, this dissertation examines the effects of a <b>pre-requisite</b> <b>information</b> literacy credit course on the information seeking behavior of community college students in an introductory nursing course. I used a convergent parallel designed mixed-methods research approach, employing both a knowledge based assessment (n = 153) and a series of interviews/focus groups (n= 16) to test the hypothesis and sub-hypotheses. Students' exposure to the library (using library databases, receiving assistance from a reference librarian, or attending a "one-shot" library instruction session) was also measured. Using the Chi-square test for association, a statistically significant relationship was found between the correct answers on the knowledge based assessment and the completion of the course: X 2 (3, N = 153) = 19. 03, p <. 00; suggesting that students who completed LIB 101 performed significantly better on the knowledge based assessment than the students who did not complete LIB 101. A low, significant, and positive relationship was found between the completion of the course and the information literacy score, rpb =. 26, p <. 01 using Point-Biserial correlation. Regression Analysis provided evidence that the library course {{was a significant predictor of}} the information literacy score, t(150) = 2. 12, p <. 05. Eleven themes supporting the quantitative study emerged from the interviews/focus groups. Although the research supported the main hypothesis, there is much room for further study [...] not only within the confines of the effect of such a course on nursing students, but also the effect of information literacy instruction on both student and practicing nurses. The future of nursing relies upon evidence based practice, and, ultimately, evidence based practice relies on information literate nurses.
