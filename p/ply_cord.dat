5000|$|Radial tire {{construction}} utilizes body <b>ply</b> <b>cords</b> {{extending from the}} beads and across the tread so that the cords are laid at approximately right angles to the centerline of the tread, and parallel to each other, as well as stabilizer belts directly beneath the tread. The belts may be cord or steel. The advantages of this construction include longer tread life, better steering control, fewer blowouts, improved fuel economy, and lower rolling resistance. Disadvantages of the radial tire are a harder ride at low speeds on rough roads and {{in the context of}} off-roading, decreased [...] "self-cleaning" [...] ability and lower grip ability at low speeds.|$|R
50|$|Bias tire (or cross ply) {{construction}} utilizes body <b>ply</b> <b>cords</b> {{that extend}} diagonally from bead to bead, usually at angles {{in the range}} of 30 to 40 degrees, with successive plies laid at opposing angles forming a crisscross pattern to which the tread is applied. The design allows the entire tire body to flex easily, providing the main advantage of this construction, a smooth ride on rough surfaces. This cushioning characteristic also causes the major disadvantages of a bias tire: increased rolling resistance and less control and traction at higher speeds. This outdated technology is still made in limited quantities to supply collector vehicles. It is possible to fit older cars with modern tires if historical authenticity is not paramount.|$|R
50|$|Air pressure, via the <b>ply</b> <b>cords,</b> exerts {{tensile force}} on the entire bead {{surrounding}} the wheel rim on which the tire is mounted, pulling outward in a 360 degree pattern. Thus the bead must have high tensile strength. With no force applied to the outer tread, the bead is pulled equally in all directions, thus no additional net {{force is applied to}} the tire bead and wheel rim. However, when the tread is pushed inward on one side, this releases some tension in the corresponding sidewall ply pulling on the bead. Yet the sidewall ply on the other side continues to pull the bead in the opposite direction. Thus the still fully tensioned sidewall ply pulls the tire bead and wheel rim {{in the same direction as}} the tread displacement with equal force as that applied to push the tread inward.|$|R
50|$|A {{series of}} <b>plies</b> of <b>cord</b> {{reinforces}} a tire. Without this, a tire would be flexible and weak. The network of cords {{that gives the}} tire strength and shape is called the carcass. Since the 1960s, all common tires have a carcass of cords of polyester, steel, or other textile materials, inlaid with several layers of rubber.|$|R
50|$|For ply-split {{braiding}} {{the point}} separates <b>plies,</b> and another <b>cord</b> is {{tucked into the}} hollow shaft of the gripfid and pulled back through the split cord. Although a latchhook may be used instead of a gripfid, the latter is much preferred.|$|R
40|$|Symmetry {{has been}} a {{dominant}} feature of ply-split braiding, particularly bilateral symmetry in traditional camel paraphernalia from Rajasthan (image 1) and radial symmetry in modern fiber art vessels (image 2). Exceptions exist, most notably in camel straps with representational figures, but they stand out as such. In recent years, however, artists have begun to experiment with more radically asymmetric forms worked in ply-split braiding. This paper explores reasons for and effects of the shift away from symmetry. In traditional work, much stake was put in technical control of material and tension. In much traditional work and symmetric ply-split fiber art, {{emphasis was placed on}} elaborate surface design, rigorously executed (image 1, 2). Both desiderata were spotlighted by symmetry. The move to asymmetry draws on alternative aesthetic and political ideas. Aesthetically, asymmetry greatly expands the range of forms that can be created. Breaking the constraints of symmetry has permitted exploration of complex surfaces, free-form openwork (image 3), and webs of interconnected stalks (image 4). Politically, asymmetry challenges prevailing criteria of quality by introducing sculpture. However, inspection of asymmetric ply-split objects shows that successful efforts generally require mastery of techniques important for creating high quality symmetric ply-split braiding. These include making of tightly <b>plied</b> <b>cords,</b> controlling tension, anticipating the shaping effect of added and removed cords, and ensuring the compatibility of structural and surface design choices. Thus, criteria for judging success in asymmetric ply-split constructions include but extend beyond those already in place for symmetric work...|$|R
5000|$|A {{radial tire}} (more properly, a radial-ply tire) is a {{particular}} design of vehicular tire. In this design, the <b>cord</b> <b>plies</b> are arranged at 90 degrees to the direction of travel, or radially (from {{the center of the}} tire). Radial tire construction climbed to 100% market share in North America, following Consumer Reports finding the superiority of the radial design in 1968.|$|R
50|$|First {{developed}} in 1952 {{under the name}} Pirelli Cintura, taking the name Cinturato in 1963, the tyre was composed {{of two or three}} carcass <b>plies</b> of <b>cords</b> laid at an angle of 90 degrees to the beads, and a belt of several plies laid circumferentially under the tread. Without a belt, the 90-degree plies would produce a casing which would greatly increase its sectional height on inflation. The belt, being inextensible, prevented the casing increasing in height when inflated, and the inflated tyre maintained almost the same dimensions as in the mould in which it went through vulcanisation. The belt was kept under tension, and the tread retained its flatter profile even when the tyre was inflated.|$|R
50|$|The {{body ply}} is a {{calendered}} sheet consisting of one layer of rubber, one layer of reinforcing fabric, {{and a second}} layer of rubber. The earliest textile used was cotton; later materials include rayon, nylon, polyester, and Kevlar. Passenger tires typically {{have one or two}} body plies. Body plies give the tire structure strength. Truck tires, off-road tires, and aircraft tires have progressively more <b>plies.</b> The fabric <b>cords</b> are highly flexible but relatively inelastic.|$|R
5000|$|By comparison, radial tires lay {{all of the}} <b>cord</b> <b>plies</b> at 90 {{degrees to}} the {{direction}} of travel (that is, across the tire from lip to lip). This design avoids having the plies rub against each other as the tire flexes, reducing the tire's rolling friction. This allows vehicles with radial tires to achieve better fuel economy than with bias-ply tires. It also accounts for the slightly [...] "low on air" [...] (bulging) look that radial tire sidewalls have, especially when compared to bias-ply tires.|$|R
50|$|This {{sidewall}} ply to bead tension {{support was}} a big reason for older cross-ply cord tire construction using the materials available in the early 19th century. The cross-ply cord arrangement orients the cords to more directly support the bead & wheel rim (like a sling: bead to cord and around below the tread back to the opposite bead, both ways, thus crossing <b>plies</b> of <b>cords).</b> However, with improved combinations of cord, bead, rim materials, and manufacturing techniques, combined with ongoing focus and research on tire efficiency and durability, it became both feasible and desirable to manufacture radial-ply cord tires, which, for many applications (despite higher costs), outperform and more than outlast (reliable-usual-service-life/cost ratio) similar cross-ply cord tire designs by (a) facilitating a flatter contact pattern with more evenly distributed pressure on the momentarily stationary area of contact between tread & ground and (b) lower operating costs over time: due to reduced tire temperature, decreased rolling resistance, lower puncture rates, greater longevity, etc.|$|R
50|$|The Pirelli Cinturato may be {{compared}} to a wheel in which the rim {{is attached to the}} hub by means of fine spokes. The tread and belt are in effect the rim; the 90-degree or radial <b>cord</b> <b>plies</b> are the spokes; and the bead is the hub. The inextensible belt and the radial casing cords were the combined factors which gave the Cinturato tyre its special properties.The different geometric arrangement of the Cinturato carcass resulted in greater deformation (bulging) {{in the area of the}} tyre section which is under load, as opposed to previous radial tyres of the period. This caused no disadvantage and did not result in greater tyre casing fatigue. Rather than having the dynamic wave form behind the road contact area, it instead formed on the side wall, increasing stability whilst also allowing the heat generated by cornering and braking to be easily dispersed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Physical {{properties}} of motorcycle tire structures {{are considered to}} help select a good and true-to-life mechanistic model suitable for finite element analysis of tires. Rubber and bias-ply layered-cord together make the inflated unhomogeneous tire structure anisotropic and geometrically highly nonlinear. A mathematical model made. of 3 -D solid and truss elements i discussed, and presented as realisnc and adequate to accommodate the anisotropy and nonlinearity inherent in the tire problem. Various loading cases, including a cambered tire with inflation pressure and vertical oad on contact patch, are studied and evaluated for force and moment acting on the tire. The results are very kncouraging and satisfactory. ~RODU~ION The carcass and the tread {{are two of the}} major por-tions that constitute a tire. The tread is the portion that is in contact with the road surface. It forms a contact patch to support the vertical loads, and gov-erns the lateral slip and adhesion against the road surface. The configurations of tread are usually peri-odically axis~met~c, i. e. the same pattern recurs at circumferential intervals. The mechanical {{properties of}} tread will inevitably affect the deformation of the carcass to some extent. However, in this study, the mathematical model will not include the tread for simplicity. In the tire deformation analysis, the tire carcass is often treated as a homogeneous anisotropic shell of revolution and local homogenuity is assumed. In such cases, the individual <b>plies</b> and <b>cords</b> are not depicted any more. The anisotropic properties of the cord-rubber laminae or laminates can be calculated by techniques developed in mechanics of composite ma-terials and the tire carcass behavior expressed by shell theory. However, in reality, a tire carcass is made of finite number of plies and is not homogeneous. Also, the cords are not invisibly small in size nor countless in number...|$|R
40|$|Ply-split {{braiding}} is a textile-making {{technique that}} involves separating the <b>plies</b> of one <b>cord</b> with a latch hook or similar tool, catching a second cord and pulling {{it through the}} gap between the plies of the first. The technique has been most fully developed by the men of the Thar Desert of Rajasthan, who use ply-split braiding, generally of 4 -ply cords of goat hair or cotton, to make girths and other paraphernalia for their camels (Harvey 1976; Quick and Stein 1982). Peter Collingwood (1998) provided the fullest description of traditional textiles made by ply-split braiding and of the techniques used to make them. In the decade following the publication of his book, fiber artists in several countries – including Collingwood himself – explored the use of ply-split braiding for novel creations, many of which were three-dimensional, in contrast with the one- and two-dimensional straps and braids more typical of traditional work in Rajasthan. Ply-split braiding has been usefully divided into three structural types, depending on the sequence and placement of cord splittings. In plain oblique twining (POT) each cord alternately splits and is split by cords that it meets along its path. In single-course oblique twining (SCOT) a cord may split or be split by several cords consecutively. In both POT and SCOT a cord typically has plie...|$|R
6000|$|This {{brings us}} to what {{is perhaps the most}} {{striking}} of all the guiding sentiments of the book. Virgil's Georgics have been described as a glorification of labour. The Encyclopædia seems inspired by the same motive, the same earnest enthusiasm for all the purposes, interests, and details of productive industry. Diderot, as has been justly said, himself the son of a cutler, might well bring handiwork into honour; assuredly he had inherited from his good father's workshop sympathy and regard for skill and labour.[167] The illustrative plates to which Diderot gave the most laborious attention for a period of almost thirty years, are not only remarkable for their copiousness, their clearness, their finish--and in all these respects they are truly admirable--but they strike us even more by the semi-poetic feeling that transforms the mere representation of a process into an animated scene of human life, stirring the sympathy and touching the imagination of the onlooker as by something dramatic. The bustle, the dexterity, the alert force of the iron foundry, the glass furnace, the gunpowder mill, the silk calendry are as skilfully reproduced as the more tranquil toil of the dairywoman, the embroiderer, the confectioner, the setter of types, the compounder of drugs, the chaser of metals. The drawings recall that eager and personal interest in his work, that nimble complacency, which is so charming a trait in the best French craftsman. The animation of these great folios of plates is prodigious. They affect one like looking down on the world of Paris from the heights of Montmartre. To turn over volume after volume is like watching a splendid panorama of all the busy life of the time. Minute care is as striking in them as their comprehensiveness. The smallest tool, the knot in a thread, the <b>ply</b> in a <b>cord,</b> the curve of wrist or finger, each has special and proper delineation. The reader smiles at a complete and elaborate set of tailor's patterns. He shudders as he comes upon the knives, the probes, the bandages, the posture, of the wretch about to undergo the most dangerous operation in surgery. In all the chief departments of industry there are plates good enough to serve for practical specifications and working drawings. It has often been told how Diderot himself used to visit the workshops, to watch the men at work, to put a thousand questions, to sit down at the loom, to have the machine pulled to pieces and set together again before his eyes, to slave like any apprentice, and to do bad work, in order, as he says, to be able to instruct others how to do good work. That was no movement of empty rhetoric which made him cry out for the Encyclopædia to become a sanctuary in which human knowledge might find shelter against time and revolutions. He actually took the pains to make it a complete storehouse of the arts, so perfect in detail that they could be at once reconstructed after a deluge in which everything had perished save a single copy of the Encyclopædia. Such details, said D'Alembert, will perhaps seem extremely out of place to certain scholars, for whom a long dissertation on the cookery or the hair-dressing of the ancients, or on the site of a ruined hamlet, or on the baptismal name of some obscure writer of the tenth century, would be vastly interesting and precious. He suggests that details of economy, and of arts and trades, have as good a right to a place as the scholastic philosophy, or some system of rhetoric still in use, or the mysteries of heraldry. Yet none even of these had been passed over.[168] ...|$|R
