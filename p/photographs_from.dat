5|$|During {{the design}} phase, Matsuno was shown <b>photographs</b> <b>from</b> France, {{particularly}} Saint-Émilion {{in the region}} of Bordeaux. This region was visited by one of Matsuno's colleagues, who was a wine enthusiast and favored Saint-Émilion, one of the largest vineyards of Bordeaux. Captivated by this small town's architecture, the design team went on a trip to France to adopt these styles into the game. A team of five people was formed in September 1998, including Matsuno and the principal persons in charge of graphics and decorations, to realize the game's setting.|$|E
5|$|During {{the middle}} of the 20th century, {{examination}} of the maps and <b>photographs</b> <b>from</b> the previous century provided clear evidence that the 150 glaciers known to have existed in the park a hundred years earlier had greatly retreated, and in many cases disappeared altogether. Repeat photography of the glaciers, such as the pictures taken of Grinnell Glacier between 1938 and 2009 as shown, help to provide visual confirmation of the extent of glacier retreat.|$|E

Altogether 150,000 individual private telegrams and state dispatches were delivered.

5|$|Paint {{samples were}} {{analysed}} and <b>photographs</b> <b>from</b> {{the time of}} opening consulted, and the bridge was restored to its original appearance. The {{main body of the}} bridge was painted in dark green, with the spandrels decorated in gilding. The lamp standards, which had been removed during the Second World War, were replaced with replicas copied from the surviving posts at the ends of the bridge. A statue of James McNeill Whistler by Nicholas Dimbleby was erected {{at the north end of}} the bridge in 2005.|$|E

5|$|As {{the game}} proceeds, flashbacks occur showing events in Harris and Klebold's lives {{which may have}} caused them to commit murder; real life events are {{compressed}} into the game's timeframe for narrative purposes. Much of the plot is constructed around the events precisely as they {{are believed to have}} occurred; lines of the gunmen's dialogue are often lifted verbatim from their writings or from their own home videos of each other. In contrast to the 16-bit graphics are digitized <b>photographs</b> <b>from</b> the shooting or full voice samples from news reports; photos of the school are used as backdrops during battle scenes.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Gladys was {{the first}} Atlantic {{hurricane}} to be observed each by the Hurricane Hunters, radar imagery, and <b>photographs</b> <b>from</b> space. The seventh named storm and fifth hurricane (including one unnamed hurricane) of the 1968 season, Gladys formed on October13 in the western Caribbean from a broad disturbance related to a tropical wave. The storm moved north-northwestward, becoming a hurricane before striking Cuba on October16. Gladys later reached peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) just before making landfall near Homosassa on the western coast of Florida on October19. The hurricane crossed the state and continued northeastward, passing just east of Cape Hatteras on October20. The next day, Gladys became extratropical and was absorbed by a cold front over Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Antoniu {{wrote that}} he thought Gibbs-Smith speculated {{on the basis of}} the {{evidence}} of absence that the aircraft was never tested or flown, but that Gibbs-Smith did not find any concrete evidence to support his position. Similarly, Antoniu was unable to find concrete proof of a test flight. Antoniu also wrote that Gibbs-Smith did not check the French patents claimed by Coandă in 1910 and 1911, describing the retractable gear, leading edge wing slot and upper wing fuel tank, and that he did not see <b>photographs</b> <b>from</b> private collections demonstrating aspects about which he wrote.|$|E
5|$|In November 1966 Life {{published}} {{a series of}} <b>photographs</b> <b>from</b> the film that Abraham Zapruder took of the Kennedy assassination. Alvarez, an expert in optics and photoanalysis, became intrigued by the pictures and began to study what could {{be learned from the}} film. Alvarez demonstrated both in theory and experiment that the backward snap of the President's head was fully consistent with his being shot from behind. He also investigated the timing of the gunshots and the shockwave which disturbed the camera, and the speed of the camera, pointing out a number of things which the FBI photoanalysts either overlooked or got wrong. He produced a paper intended as a tutorial, with informal advice for the physicist intent on arriving at the truth.|$|E
