The first year of this study was conducted during the 2003 heat wave, and high temperatures were therefore considered as a confounding factor in the data analysis. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the relationship between ozone and temperature in order to propose a methodology to distinguish between the effects of ozone and temperature on the impact of a prevention strategy with regard to ozone pollution. Methods Multivariate analyses were used to identify associated climate and ozone pollution profiles. This descriptive method is of great value to highlight the complexity of interactions between these parameters. Results Ozone concentration and temperature were strongly correlated, but the health impact of ozone pollution alone will be evaluated by focusing on situations characterized by ozone concentrations above 110 μg/m 3 / 8 h (air quality guidelines to protect human health defined by the French legislation) and temperatures lower than 26 °C, below the discomfort threshold.

However, {{the roles of}} oyster microbiomes have not been integrated {{into any of the}} services, particularly nitrogen removal through denitrification. We investigated the composition and denitrification potential of oyster microbiomes with an approach that combined 16 S rRNA gene analysis, metabolic inference, qPCR of the nitrous oxide reductase gene (nosZ), and N 2 flux measurements. Microbiomes of the oyster digestive gland, the oyster shell, and sediments adjacent to the oyster reef were examined based on next generation sequencing (NGS) of 16 S rRNA gene amplicons. Denitrification potentials of the microbiomes were determined by metabolic inferences using a customized denitrification gene and genome database with the <b>paprica</b> (PAthway PRediction by phylogenetIC plAcement) bioinformatics pipeline. Denitrification genes examined included nitrite reductase (nirS and nirK) and nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ), which was further subdivided by genotype into clade I (nosZI) or clade II (nosZII). Continuous flow through experiments measuring N 2 fluxes were conducted with the oysters, shells, and sediments to compare denitrification activities. <b>Paprica</b> properly classified the composition of microbiomes, showing similar classification results from Silva, Greengenes and RDP databases. Microbiomes of the oyster digestive glands and shells were quite different from each other and from the sediments. The relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria inferred by <b>paprica</b> was higher in oysters and shells than in sediments suggesting that oysters act as hotspots for denitrification in the marine environment. Similarly, the inferred nosZI gene abundances were also higher in the oyster and shell microbiomes than in the sediment microbiome. Gene abundances for nosZI were verified with qPCR of nosZI genes, which showed a significant positive correlation (F 1, 7 = 14. 7, p = 6. 0 x 10 - 3, R 2 = 0. 68). N 2 flux rates were significantly higher in the oyster (364. 4 ± 23. 5 μmol N-N 2 m- 2 h- 1) and oyster shell (355. 3 ± 6. 4 μmol N-N 2 m- 2 h- 1) compared to the sediment (270. 5 ± 20. 1 μmol N-N 2 m- 2 h- 1). Thus, bacteria carrying nosZI genes were found to be an important denitrifier, facilitating nitrogen removal in oyster reefs. In addition, this is the first study to validate the use of 16 S gene based metabolic inference as a method for determining microbiome function, such as denitrification, by comparing inference results with qPCR gene quantification and rate measurements...|$|E

Assim, o objetivo deste trabalho foi microencapsular oleoresina de <b>páprica,</b> avaliar a morfologia das microcápsulas, a distribuição e o tamanho das partículas e a solubilidade. Para tanto, foi utilizado o processo de microencapsulação por atomização e os agentes encapsulantes goma arábica e grânulos porosos de amido/gelatina. A avaliação morfológica, feita por microscopia eletrônica de varredura, mostrou que as microcápsulas elaboradas com goma arábica possuíam formato arredondado, com concavidades, sem poros ou rachaduras, paredes contínuas e o recheio estava distribuído em vacúolos nas paredes; já as produzidas com grânulos porosos de amido/gelatina apresentavam formato arredondado, paredes formadas pela aglomeração dos grânulos e coladas pela gelatina, entretanto, apresentavam poros ou interstícios. A distribuição do tamanho de partículas apresentou comportamento unimodal, com tamanho médio de 16 e 20, 3 µm para as microcápsulas produzidas com goma e amido/gelatina, respectivamente. Portanto, foi possível microencapsular oleoresina de <b>páprica</b> pelo método de atomização, com os dois agentes encapsulantes testados; a análise da morfologia deu indícios de que a oleoresina estaria mais protegida quando encapsulada em goma arábica; as temperaturas utilizadas na microencapsulação foram adequadas; as microcápsulas apresentaram tamanhos dentro da faixa obtida para este tipo de processo e {{excelente}} solubilidade. Paprika (Capsicum annuum L.) is {{a bright}} red coloring product of large use by the food industry. Rich in carotenoids, paprika is susceptible to oxidative degradation. Considering these aspects, this research is aimed to microencapsulate paprika oleoresin and to evaluate morphological characteristics, distribution and average particle size and the solubility of microencapsulated paprika oleoresin. The microencapsulation {{was carried out by}} spray drying, in porous agglomerates of rice starch/gelatin and arabic gum. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed, for arabic gum microcapsules, a cylindrical shape with a continuous wall with no apparent porosity or cracks and the core was distributed within the wall. The porous agglomerates of rice starch/gelatin microcapsules also presented a cylindrical shape; the walls were formed by the granules of rice starch, which was glued by gelatin; however the structure was shown to be porous. Both materials presented unimodal distribution, with an average particle size of 16 and 20. 3 µm for arabic gum and starch/gelatin microcapsules, respectively. In spite of {{that it is possible to}} microencapsulate paprika oleoresin with both materials using the spray drying process, the morphologycal analysis revealed that arabic gum seems to be a more effective barrier to the core material.
