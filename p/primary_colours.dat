5|$|They {{recorded}} <b>Primary</b> <b>Colours</b> {{over the}} night of 3 August 2007 {{and part of the}} following day, in the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra on an 8-track, a form of multi-track recording. The process of recording it took 24hours and cost $1500. The day after recording finished, the band and their engineer, Lachlan Wooden, added overdubs to the tentracks. After recording, Eddy Current Suppression Ring toured the US for three weeks, after which Eddy Current, the band's guitarist, mixed the album during November and December 2007. The four members self-produced <b>Primary</b> <b>Colours.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gaudí {{was also}} an {{innovator}} {{in the realm of}} craftsmanship, conceiving new technical and decorative solutions with his materials, for example his way of designing ceramic mosaics made of waste pieces ("trencadís") in original and imaginative combinations. For the restoration of Mallorca Cathedral he invented a new technique to produce stained glass, which consisted of juxtaposing three glass panes of <b>primary</b> <b>colours,</b> and sometimes a neutral one, varying the thickness of the glass in order to graduate the light's intensity.|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} {{gradually}} {{moved away from}} being a pursuit for wealthy amateurs to one dominated by working-class professionals, kits changed accordingly. The clubs themselves, rather than individual players, were now responsible for purchasing kit and financial concerns, along {{with the need for}} the growing numbers of spectators to easily identify the players, led to the lurid colours of earlier years being abandoned in favour of simple combinations of <b>primary</b> <b>colours.</b> In 1890 the Football League, which had been formed two years earlier, ruled that no two member teams could register similar colours, so as to avoid clashes. This rule was later abandoned in favour of one stipulating that all teams must have a second set of shirts in a different colour available. Initially the home team was required to change colours {{in the event of a}} clash, but in 1921 the rule was amended to require the away team to change.|$|E

25|$|Goldfish {{have one}} of the most studied senses of vision in fishes. Goldfish have four kinds of cone cells, which are {{respectively}} sensitive to different colours: red, green, blue and ultraviolet.

25|$|Yellow {{and pink}} are {{a mix of}} red and green or blue. Other shades of red as well as orange may be seen on rare occasions; yellow-green is {{moderately}} common. As red, green, and blue are the <b>primary</b> <b>colours</b> of additive synthesis of colours, in theory practically any colour might be possible but the ones {{mentioned in this article}} comprise a virtually exhaustive list.|$|E

25|$|Elio Fiorucci {{was born}} in Milan on 10 June 1935, son of a shoe shop owner. One day in 1962, Elio {{came up with the}} idea of making galoshes in bright <b>primary</b> <b>colours</b> whilst working at his father's shop. When they were {{featured}} in a local weekly fashion magazine, the galoshes caused a sensation. Following a trip to London in 1965, Elio was determined to bring Carnaby Street fashions to Milan. He opened his first shop on Galleria Passerella in Milan on 31 May 1967 selling clothes by London designers such as Ossie Clark and Zandra Rhodes.|$|E
25|$|Newton {{had studied}} these books, or, in some cases, {{secondary}} sources based on them, and taken notes entitled Quaestiones quaedam philosophicae (Questions about philosophy) during {{his days as}} an undergraduate. During this period (1664–1666) he created the basis of calculus, and performed the first experiments in the optics of colour. At this time, his proof that white light {{was a combination of}} <b>primary</b> <b>colours</b> (found via prismatics) replaced the prevailing theory of colours and received an overwhelmingly favourable response, and occasioned bitter disputes with Robert Hooke and others, which forced him to sharpen his ideas {{to the point where he}} already composed sections of his later book Opticks by the 1670s in response. Work on calculus is shown in various papers and letters, including two to Leibniz. He became a fellow of the Royal Society and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics (succeeding Isaac Barrow) at Trinity College, Cambridge.|$|E

50|$|Until today, the team's {{traditional}} colours {{are green}} and white (green for health, nature, such as physiolatry, and white for virtue), although the white sometimes is omitted, used as trim or as an alternative. During the first years after the establishment of green as Panathinaikos' <b>primary</b> <b>colour,</b> players were wearing green shirts, white shorts and green socks. During the 1930s, an appearance with characteristic horizontal strips was established. This motive was used also in the next decades as primary or second choice. Since then, the uniform style has changed many times, but green has always remained the team's <b>primary</b> <b>colour.</b>|$|R
25|$|Since the club's foundation, the <b>primary</b> <b>colours</b> {{have been}} red, blue, and white, {{with the latter}} being the most {{predominant}} of the three. During {{the early years of}} the club's existence, Olympique Lyonnais primarily played in all-white uniforms. In 1955, Lyon officials decided to add a red and blue scapular and blue shorts to the combination. In 1961, the scapular tradition was disbanded and the two strips of red and blue were shaped horizontally. After six years, the club returned to the all-white uniforms, but kept intact the red and blue stripes, but, instead of keeping them horizontally, inserted them vertically and on the left side of the shirt. Lyon began wearing the shirt during the 1970–71 season and wore the kits up until the 1975–76 season. For the 2002–03 season, chairman Jean-Michel Aulas announced that the club would return the kits. Lyon wore them, with several different modifications every year, for six of their seven consecutive titles.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{rebranding}} of the New Zealand Railways Corporation {{during the}} 1980s, a new dark blue livery {{was applied to the}} TranzAlpine, with a horizontal full-length 220mm thick white stripe sandwiching a 100mm thick red band. The name InterCity was imposed into the stripe as well. This dark blue livery would become standard and remain contemporary until 18 October 1995. In 1990, when New Zealand Rail Limited took over rail operations from the Corporation, the InterCity livery was modified to facilitate the new blue and yellow <b>primary</b> <b>colours,</b> and the red band on carriage sides was replaced by a 100mm yellow one. In 1993-1994 the yellow band was replaced by a green 100mm band, the white stripe and dark blue livery retained. In 1995, a new full-length 350mm light blue stripe, incorporating the Tranz Scenic logo was introduced on cars that were not painted all over in the new blue colour scheme. However, during the 1995 rebranding, the TranzAlpine cars were the first long-distance passenger cars to receive the new paint scheme and did not wear the transitional light blue stripe.|$|E
