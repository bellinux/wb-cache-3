Given a {{transaction}} database {{as a global}} set of transactions and its local database obtained by some conditioning to the global one, we consider a pair of itemsets whose degrees of correlations are higher in the local database than in the global one. A problem of finding paired itemsets with high correlation in one database is known as Discovery of Correlation, and some algorithms to search for such characteristic paired itemsets are already proposed. However, even non-characteristic paired itemsets in the local database are also meaningful, provided the degree of correlation increases much higher in the local database than in the global one. They can be an implicit and hidden evidence showing that something particular to the local database occurs {{even though they are}} not yet realized as characteristic ones in the local. From this viewpoint, we have already proposed to measure the significance of paired itemsets by the difference of two correlations before and after the conditioning to the local database, and define a notion of DC pairs whose degrees of differences of correlations are high. As DC pairs are regarded as compound itemsets consisting of two component itemsets, we can have two basic strategies for finding them. One strategy firstly examines the compound itemsets and then the components, while another one does the component itemsets and then the compound ones. According to the former strategy, which we have already proposed and tested for its effectiveness, we have to enumerate many number of candidate compound itemsets that cannot be decomposable to components. For this reason, this paper presents a new algorithm according to the second strategy. It firstly enumerate possible component itemsets based on a new <b>pruning</b> rule <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> off useless components. Secondly it forms the compound itemsets by combining the components thus detected, while we also make use of a constraint for preventing our algorithm from checking meaningless combinations. ...|$|R
40|$|Iceberg cubing is a {{valuable}} technique in data warehouses. The efficiency of iceberg cube computation comes from efficient aggregation and effective <b>pruning</b> <b>for</b> constraints. In advanced applications, iceberg constraints are often non-monotone and complex, for example, "Average cost in the range [51, 52] and standard deviation of cost less than beta". The current cubing algorithms either are efficient in aggregation but weak in <b>pruning</b> <b>for</b> such constraints, or can <b>prune</b> <b>for</b> non-monotone constraints but are inefficient in aggregation. The best algorithm of the former, Star-cubing, computes aggregations of cuboids simultaneously but its pruning is specific to only monotone constraints such as "COUNT(*) {{greater than or equal}} to delta". In the latter case, the Divide and Approximate pruning technique can <b>prune</b> <b>for</b> non-monotone constraints but is limited to bottom-up single-group aggregation. We propose a solution that exhibits both efficiency in aggregation and generality and effectiveness in <b>pruning</b> <b>for</b> complex constraints. Our bounding techniques are as general as the Divide and Approximate <b>pruning</b> techniques <b>for</b> complex constraints and yet our multiway aggregation is as efficient as Star-cubing...|$|R
2500|$|Kubikiri: A {{very rare}} type; the {{sharpened}} blade {{is on the}} inside curve rather than the outside. It has no sharpened point, {{making it difficult to}} use in battle and enshrouding the weapon in mystery. Kubikiri can be roughly translated to [...] "head cutter". According to one myth, they were carried by attendants of samurai <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> off the heads of fallen enemies. There are other speculations existing about the kubikiri’s possible uses. Perhaps they were used by doctors or carried by high-ranking officials as a badge is worn today. They could also have been used <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> charcoal or incense, or used as an artistic tool <b>for</b> <b>pruning</b> bonsai trees.|$|R
