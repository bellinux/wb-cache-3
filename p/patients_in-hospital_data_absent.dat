MethodsSince January 2003, 48 vascular surgeons from nine hospitals in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont (25 to 615 beds) have prospectively recorded <b>patient,</b> procedure, and <b>in-hospital</b> <b>patient</b> outcome <b>data.</b> Results plus 1 -year follow-up data analyzed at a central site are reported anonymously to each center at semiannual meetings where care processes and regional benchmarks are discussed. Mortality and compliance with procedure entry were validated by independent comparison with hospital administrative data. Initial improvement efforts focused on optimizing preoperative medication usage. ResultsA total of 6143 operations {{were entered into}} the registry through December 2006. In-hospital stroke or death after CEA was 1. 0 %, major amputation or death after LEB was 3. 8 %, and mortality was 2. 9 % after elective open and 0. 4 % after endovascular repair.

40|$|Background: Although {{in-hospital}} stroke is not {{a common}} occurrence, {{it is important to}} identify what components of stroke care these patients receive. The aims of this study were to estimate the clinical characteristics, process of stroke care, and mortality in patients admitted to hospital with stroke compared with <b>patients</b> with <b>in-hospital</b> strokes. Methods: <b>Data</b> from a community-based stroke register (1995 - 2004) in an inner city multiethnic population of 271, 817 in South London, United Kingdom, were analyzed. Results: From a total of 2402 patients, 291 (12. 1 %) had <b>in-hospital</b> strokes. <b>Patients</b> with <b>in-hospital</b> strokes {{were more likely to be}} incontinent, be dysphagic, have a motor deficit, and have a low level of consciousness (P <. 001) compared with admitted patients with stroke. Brain imaging was carried out more frequently in admitted patients with stroke (P <. 001). Access to stroke unit care was higher in admitted patients with stroke (P <. 001). <b>In-hospital</b> <b>patients</b> with stroke had a longer mean length of stay (55. 9 days) compared with admitted patients with stroke (37. 9 days, P <. 001). There were no significant differences between the groups for receipt of physiotherapy or occupational therapy after discharge (P =. 232) or receipt of speech and language therapy (P =. 345). After adjustment of case mix variables, <b>in-hospital</b> <b>patients</b> with stroke were less likely to undergo imaging (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 54, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 33 - 0. 89, P =. 015). <b>In-hospital</b> <b>patients</b> with stroke were less likely to be treated in a stroke unit (OR = 0. 33, 95 % CI = 0. 22 - 0. 50, P <. 001) and prescribed antiplatelet therapy at 3 months (OR = 0. 51, 95 % CI = 0. 30 - 0. 88, P =. 015).

40|$|Ischaemic stroke is an {{important}} cause of death and disability worldwide. The occluded cerebral artery can be opened using recanalization therapy, but only within the first few hours after symptom onset. Early hospital admission is therefore essential. The aim of this thesis was to describe the current performance of the Finnish emergency medical service (EMS) system in prehospital stroke care and explore new innovations to improve it. The thesis {{was based on the}} analysis of emergency phone call tapes, prehospital <b>patient</b> reports and <b>in-hospital</b> <b>data.</b> The emergency medical dispatchers used the stroke code in more than 60 % of the calls and dispatched more than 80 % of the ambulances with high priority. The paramedics suspected less than 90 % of the patients to have stroke symptoms and transported the patients using the high priority designation at nearly the same frequency. The prehospital time intervals of patients who received recanalization treatment were analysed sequentially. Both the door-to-needle time (DTT) and onset-to-treatment time (OTT) were significantly reduced during the study period, which was reciprocated by the increasing number of treated patients, but none of the prehospital time intervals [onset-to-door time (ODT), onset-to-dispatch time, transportation time] changed appreciably. Ambulance transport using high priority and onset-to-call time duration were the most significant predictors of early hospital arrival (ODT 2 h) was the onset-to-call time (41 minutes), the single most dominant operational variable in the mean additional delays was OST, with > 2 minutes of added delay. Using fire engines to support ambulances in prehospital stroke care more than doubled the number of EMS personnel on the scene but no change in on-scene time (OST) or other prehospital time intervals was observed. Only the use of stroke code in ambulance dispatch was associated with a short OST (< 22 minutes). An EMS training programme decreased the OST from 25 to 22. 5 minutes. Consulting a physician via telephone was associated with a longer OST, whereas advanced life support training of the EMS personnel promoted a shorter OST when compared to basic life support -trained crews. A total of 55 % of the patients had a good outcome (modified Rankin Scale  2), which was associated with the patient’s age, stroke severity and DTT. As a conclusion, the most significant delays of the prehospital phase were seen in the decision to call the emergency phone number and OST. Early emergency call, more severe symptoms and high priority ambulance transport were the most important determinants of early hospital arrival and treatment. Implementing a systematic training programme for EMS staff successfully decreased the OST by 10 %...|$|R

BACKGROUNDMost studies of cardiac arrest report outcome following out-of-hospital resuscitation. In contrast, there are minimal data on long-term outcome following in-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODSThe AVID Study was a multicenter, randomized comparison of drug and defibrillator strategies to treat life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. A Registry was maintained of all patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias at each study site. The present study includes patients who had AVID-eligible arrhythmias, both randomized and not randomized. <b>Patients</b> with <b>in-hospital</b> and out-of-hospital presentations are compared. Data on long-term mortality were obtained through the National Death Index. RESULTSThe unadjusted mortality rates at one- and two-year follow-ups were 23 % and 31. 1 % for <b>patients</b> with <b>in-hospital</b> presentations, and 10. 5 % and 16. 8 % for those with out-of-hospital presentations (p < 0. 001), respectively. The adjusted mortality rates at one- and two-year follow-ups were 14. 8 % and 20. 9 % for <b>patients</b> with <b>in-hospital</b> presentations, and 8. 4 % and 14. 1 % for those with out-of-hospital presentations (p < 0. 001), respectively. The adjusted long-term relative risk for in-hospital versus out-of-hospital presentation was 1. 6 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 3 – 1. 9). CONCLUSIONSCompared with patients with out-of-hospital presentations of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias not due to a reversible cause, <b>patients</b> with <b>in-hospital</b> presentations have a worse long-term prognosis. Because location of ventricular arrhythmia presentation is an independent predictor of long-term outcome, it should be considered as an element of risk stratification and when planning clinical trials...|$|R

We investigated the 1 -year clinical outcomes after ST in 54 <b>patients</b> with <b>in-hospital</b> ST compared with 102 patients with out-of-hospital ST. ResultsOne year after the ST event, <b>patients</b> with <b>in-hospital</b> compared with out-of-hospital ST had significantly greater mortality (27. 8 % vs. 10. 8 %, p < 0. 01); most deaths in both groups occurred within 1 week of the ST event. <b>Patients</b> with <b>in-hospital</b> ST also had higher rates of major bleeding (21. 2 % vs. 6. 0 %, p < 0. 01), but a lower rate of myocardial infarction (56. 6 % vs. 77. 5 %, p < 0. 01).

METHODS: Patients with ISR following bare-metal stenting (BMS) and treated with SES were prospectively studied. Baseline, procedural, and <b>in-hospital</b> <b>data</b> were appraised. The primary endpoint was the rate of major cardiovascular events (MACE) at long-term follow up (> 9 months). Secondary endpoints were the individual contributors to MACE. RESULTS: A total of 180 SES were implanted to treat 138 consecutive patients. Procedural success was achieved in all <b>patients</b> without <b>in-hospital</b> death, acute stent thrombosis, stroke, or urgent coronary artery bypass. During follow up, MACE occurred in 5. 8 % of patients at 6 months, 14. 3 % at 12 months, and 25 % at 24 months. Specifically, all-cause mortality was 1. 7 % at 6 months, 3. 5 % at 12 months, and 4. 8 % at 24 months, for a total of 5 deaths. Target vessel revascularization occurred at 6, 12, and 24 months in 4. 2 %, 11. 2 %, and 15. 9 % of patients, respectively, while target lesion revascularization (TLR) alone accounted for 3. 4 % at 6 months, 9. 6 % at 12 months, and 11 % at 24 months. Three case of myocardial infarction occurred during follow up (2. 2 %), without any surgical revascularization or stent thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of ISR with SES appears safe and effective, even if a 10 % annual rate of MACE can be expected, with a sizable portion of these due to apparently nontarget lesion events. © 2007 HMP Communications | All Rights Reserved...|$|R

From 4 studies having included patients with IHCA or OHCA, {{it was not}} possible to separately analyse IHCA patients [37, 39 – 41]. In the overall population, the results are either in favour of TTM [31, 42] or neutral [34, 37, 39 – 41].|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{describe}} the cardiovascular manifestations {{of carbon monoxide}} (CO) poisoning. BackgroundCarbon monoxide poisoning is a common cause of toxicologic morbidity and mortality. Although the neurologic sequelae of CO poisoning have been well described, the cardiovascular consequences are limited to isolated case reports. MethodsWe reviewed the cardiovascular manifestations of 230 consecutive patients treated for moderate to severe CO poisoning in the hyperbaric oxygen chamber at Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC), a regional center for treatment of CO poisoning. ResultsThe mean age was 47. 2 years with 72 % men. Ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes were present in 30 % of patients, whereas only 16 % had a normal ECG. Cardiac biomarkers (creatine kinase-MB fraction or troponin I) were elevated in 35 % of <b>patients.</b> <b>In-hospital</b> mortality was 5 %. ConclusionsCardiovascular sequelae of CO poisoning are frequent, with myocardial injury assessed by biomarkers or ECG in 37 % of patients. Patients {{admitted to the hospital}} with CO poisoning should have a baseline ECG and serial cardiac biomarkers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMost of the {{information}} on predisposing factors and mortality in status epilepticus (SE) arises from data obtained from patients presenting to the casualty department. However, another population which is frequently seen by consultative neurologists are medically ill patients who develop SE while in hospital. These patients are often notoriously difficult to treat once SE arises. We sought to characterize patients at risk for SE arising when they are hospitalized for other reasons. By doing this, risk factors for developing SE and prognostic indicators might be determined. We retrospectively reviewed records from three urban hospitals in the United States to identify hospitalized patients developing SE over a 1 year period. SE {{was defined as a}} clinical seizure lasting 30 minutes or longer, or repeated seizures without recovery. Patients who were admitted in SE or for an epilepsy-related problem, or who were less than 1 year old were excluded from the study. Forty-one <b>patients</b> with <b>in-hospital</b> SE were identified. There were 28 males and 13 females with an age range from 1 to 91 years (mean: 60 years, median: 65 years). The mean interval from hospital admission to the onset of status epilepticus was 26 days. Nineteen (46 %) patients had a prior history of either epilepsy or symptomatic seizures, and of these, 10 were inadequately treated as judged by serum anticonvulsant levels at the time SE developed. Focal brain abnormality was present in 26 (63 %) patients, the most common of which was stroke (17 patients). Major metabolic derangements including hypoxia, electrolyte imbalance, hepatic encephalopathy, and sepsis were present in 23 (56 %) patients. Eleven (27 %) patients were being treated with theophylline preparations at the time SE developed. Mortality in this group of <b>patients</b> with <b>in-hospital</b> SE was 61 % (25 deaths), with about one-third dying while in status, and two-thirds dying subsequently in hospital. In this retrospective study, there was no clear relationship between mortality and the duration of SE in this group of <b>patients.</b> <b>In-hospital</b> development of SE is usually related to underlying focal brain abnormality, especially stroke, in combination with systemic metabolic derangement. Prognosis is poor, and appears to be more related to underlying conditions rather than to status duration. More accurate prospective studies are warranted...|$|R
40|$|Delirium in elderly {{patients}} {{is associated with}} various long-term sequelae that include cognitive impairment and affective disturbances, although the latter is understudied. For a prospective cohort study of {{elderly patients}} undergoing hip fracture surgery, baseline characteristics and affective and cognitive functioning were assessed preoperatively. During hospital admission, presence of delirium was assessed daily. Three months after hospital discharge, affective and global cognitive functioning was evaluated again in patients free from delirium {{at the time of}} this follow-up. This study compared baseline characteristics and affective functioning between patients with and without in-hospital delirium. We investigated whether in-hospital delirium is associated with increased anxiety and depressive levels, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms three months after discharge. Among 53 eligible patients, 23 (43. 4 %) <b>patients</b> experienced <b>in-hospital</b> delirium after hip fracture repair. Patients who had experienced in-hospital delirium showed more depressive symptoms at follow-up after three months compared to the 30 <b>patients</b> without <b>in-hospital</b> delirium. This association persisted in a multivariate model controlling for age, baseline cognition, baseline depressive symptoms, and living situation. The level of anxiety and symptoms of PTSD at follow-up did not differ between both groups. This study suggests that in-hospital delirium is associated with an increased burden of depressive symptoms three months after discharge in elderly patients who were admitted to the hospital for surgical repair of hip fracture. Symptoms of depression in <b>patients</b> with previous <b>in-hospital</b> delirium cannot be fully explained by persistent (sub) syndromal delirium or baseline cognitive impairmen...|$|R
30|$|Introduction: Hypoxic {{hepatitis}} (HH) is {{a frequent}} found condition in critically ill patients and {{is associated with a}} high morbidity and mortality. Up to 10  % of critically ill patients suffer from HH during their stay at the ICU. Literature of HH after cardiac arrest is scarce and only available in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (CA). To date no study evaluated the incidence and outcome of HH in <b>patients</b> after <b>in-hospital</b> CA.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Previous {{analyses}} {{have suggested}} {{an association between}} centre volume and in-hospital mortality, post-operative complications, and mortality in those {{patients who suffer from}} a complication. We sought to determine the nature of this association using a multicentre cohort. Methods: All the patients, aged 18 years or younger, undergoing heart surgery at centres participating in the European Congenital Heart Surgeons Database (2003 - 2013) were included. Programmes were grouped as follows: small 350. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the differences between groups with the adjusted in-hospital mortality, onset of any and/or major complication, and in-hospital mortality in those patients with any and/or major complication. The outcomes were adjusted for patient specific risk factors and surgical risk factors. Results: The data set consisted of 119, 345 procedures performed in 99 centres. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 4. 63 %; complications occurred in 23. 4 % of the <b>patients.</b> <b>In-hospital</b> mortality in <b>patients</b> with complications was 13. 82 %. Multivariable logistic regression showed that the risk of in-hospital death was higher in low-and medium-volume centres (...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the existence of racial differences in the survival of patients admitted to intensive care by family physicians and general internists for circulatory illnesses. The study population consisted of 249 consecutive patients admitted by these specialists to an ICU in a tertiary care hospital in Pitt County, North Carolina, during the June 1985 to June 1986 period. Logistic regression was used to specify the unique effect of race on ICU <b>patient</b> survival <b>in-hospital,</b> controlling for potential confounding factors such as disease severity, type of health insurance, and case mix. Black patients were almost {{three times more likely}} than white <b>patients</b> to die <b>in-hospital</b> following admission to the ICU (RR = 2. 9, 95 percent I = 1. 5, 5. 6). Most of this difference in survival was explained by racial differences in disease severity...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In the {{majority}} of literature concerning age in TBI, specifically in subdural hematomas (SDH), {{the mean age of}} patients considered elderly is 55 - 65. Limited data in SDH patients 3 ̆e 75 years suggest an increased mortality rate. The impact of medical decision making on these data is not well-documented. PATIENTS/METHODS: We use the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database to compare outcomes between SDH patients 60 - 79 and 3 ̆e/= 80. As administrative databases have some shortcomings, i. e. <b>in-hospital</b> <b>data</b> only, acute and chronic SDHs listed together, we examined institutional data to evaluate the impact of these factors on medical decision making which may falsely elevate mortality rates. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was increased in NIS patients 3 ̆e 80 treated both surgically and non-surgically (P 80 with SDHs as a group. However, the SDH patients 3 ̆e 80 who underwent surgery at our institution had much lower mortality rates. We found that patients 3 ̆e/= 80 made up 87...|$|R
