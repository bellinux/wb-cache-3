25|$|EasyJet, like Ryanair, uses a {{business}} model pioneered by Southwest Airlines. Both airlines have adapted this {{model for the}} European market through further cost-cutting measures, such as not selling connecting flights or providing complimentary snacks on board. The key points of this business model are high aircraft utilisation, quick turnaround times, charging for extras (such as <b>priority</b> boarding, <b>hold</b> baggage and food) and keeping operating costs low. One main difference easyJet and Ryanair have from Southwest is they both fly a young fleet of aircraft. Southwest has an average fleet age of 11.9 years whereas Ryanair's and easyJet's average fleet ages are just a little over six years each.|$|R
40|$|The {{antecedent}} of {{this thesis}} is {{a reaction to}} a history of imposition on architectural solutions {{and the notion that}} there are architectural equations or languages that can repeatedly answer design and social issues regardless of time and place. This position does not advocate designing in a vacuum, quite the opposite. As Siza says in the quote on page 34 : " [...] . proposals which refuse to set limits to reality cannot be based in a fixed image nor can they have a linear development. " If the focused <b>priority</b> <b>holds</b> on the whole problem at that very moment and place, the result will become a response to some of the much larger questions, and that singular project {{will be able to use}} the greater body of knowledge which we all accrue over time, and not vise versa. The intent of this thesis is to explore some of the works of one architect, Alvaro Siza, as an exercise in understanding a process of form-making. The Portuguese architect was chosen for his unique stance in the recent past's and present time's architectural situation, and for the author's continual attraction to his work. The research of Siza's projects becomes a springboard for approaching an investigation into a design project for Wellesley College. A dialogue with the work of Alvaro Siza will supply feedback and examples. Inevitably, the research will have a life within the exploration of the Wellesley project as the movement from one to the other forces better understanding of both. Sylvia Tove-Ann Richards.

25|$|Ever {{since the}} Augustinian hypothesis, {{scholars}} continue {{to debate the}} order in which the gospels were written, and how they may have influenced each other, and several hypothesis exist in that regard, e.g. the Markan <b>priority</b> hypothesis <b>holds</b> that the Gospel of Mark was written first c. 70 CE. In this approach, Matthew is placed at being sometime after this date and Luke is thought to have been written between 70 and 100 CE. However, according to the competing, and more popular, Q source hypothesis, the gospels were not independently written, but were derived from a common source called Q. The two-source hypothesis then proposes that the authors of Matthew and Luke drew on the Gospel of Mark as well as on Q.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} queuing architecture, which {{supports}} both elastic and inelastic traffic. In this architecture, a single priority queue is maintained at the transmitting node. The <b>priority</b> queue <b>holds</b> all the packets whose routes traverse. It uses virtual queue algorithm {{to reduce the}} experienced delay by comprising virtual queues that are served {{at a fraction of}} the actual service rate and using the virtual queue-length values in utility function. Then, the optimization framework is used where the scheduling algorithm allocates the resource fairly in the network for both elastic and inelastic flows. Finally, priority dropping active queue management algorithm is applied based on proportional-integral design (PID) mechanism. This algorithm provides the differentiated service for the different layers or frames according to their priority. When network congestion arises, the low-priority packet is dropped initially. After that, the second low-priority packet is dropped and so on.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{preemption}} policy {{currently in}} use in MPLS-enabled commercial routers selects LSPs for preemption based only on their <b>priority</b> and <b>holding</b> time. This can lead to waste of resources and excessive number of rerouting decisions. In this paper, a new preemption policy is proposed and complemented with an adaptive scheme that aims to minimize rerouting. The new policy combines the three main preemption optimization criteria: number of LSPs to be preempted, priority of the LSPs, and preempted bandwidth. Weights can be configured to stress the desired criteria. The new policy is complemented by an adaptive scheme that selects lower priority LSPs that can afford to have their rate reduced. The selected LSPs will fairly reduce their rate {{in order to accommodate}} the new high-priority LSP setup request. Performance comparisons of a nonpreemptive approach, a policy currently in use by commercial routers, and our policies are also investigated...|$|R

30|$|One of {{the aims}} of {{learning}} science at school is to prepare individuals to take up science-related occupations or jobs (Aikenhead 2005). In view of this, the important goal of relevant science education is to recognize the perceived need to prepare and equip learners for future occupation. Some studies revealed that some factors are taken into consideration by students when decisions on the career choice or path are made (Sadler et al. 2012; Correl 2004; Lewis and Collins 2001). Such factors {{are likely to be}} the different hopes and <b>priorities</b> students <b>hold</b> for their future, which might be important for the choice of a future occupation or job.

40|$|Sustainable {{school reform}} efforts {{are needed to}} move schools closer toward the ideals of equity, justice and success for every student. The {{success or failure of}} a school and its {{students}} often hinges on the effectiveness of leadership. Research reveals that transformational school leaders become effective change agents by developing a shared vision for the school, building consensus around key <b>priorities,</b> <b>holding</b> high expectations, providing support, modeling appropriate values and building collaborative cultures and shared leadership. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the predictive relationship between the emotional and social competence and transformational leadership behaviors of school principals. Principals participating in the study completed the five transformational subscales of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ 5 x) and the Emotional and Social Competency Inventory (ESCI), while their superintendents completed the rater versions of the MLQ and ESCI. The relationship between the transformational scales on the MLQ and scores from the ESCI were calculated using Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rho coefficients. A Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test was calculated to determine the significance of difference between the self-assessment and other-rater assessment of transformational leader behaviors and social and emotional competency. A multiple regression analysis was conducted to assess the predictive relationship between the dispositional skills and transformational leadership behaviors of the school principal. Findings from this study suggest that the ability of the school leader to manage relationships, understand the thoughts, feelings, and perspectives of others, recognize the bigger picture, control disruptive impulses and be flexible in the face of change predicts behaviors that can lead to meaningful reforms efforts and positive school outcomes. Given that these skills can be taught and learned across the lifespan, research findings offer implications for leadership preparation and training programs, administrator evaluation, professional development, and hiring practices. The small sample size of the current study impacts the generalizability and statistical validity of the conclusions. Future research should include a larger sample of principals from a variety of settings. In this research, a 360 -degree assessment of the principals 2 ̆ 7 transformational leader behaviors and emotional and social competencies should be ascertained from supervisors, colleagues, teachers, staff and students...|$|R
