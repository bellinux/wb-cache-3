5|$|This {{included}} the planting of <b>Pinot</b> <b>noir</b> grapes in the Willamette Valley, a region long thought {{too cold to}} be suitable for viticulture. In the 1970s, more out-of-state winemakers migrated {{to the state and}} started to organize as an industry. The state's land use laws had prevented rural hillsides from being turned into housing tracts, preserving a significant amount of land suitable for vineyards. In 1979, The Eyrie Vineyards entered a 1975 <b>Pinot</b> <b>noir</b> in the Wine Olympics; the wine was rated among the top Pinots in the world, thus gaining the region its first international recognition.|$|E
5|$|The {{region is}} best known for its <b>Pinot</b> <b>noir,</b> and also {{produces}} large amounts of Pinot gris, Chardonnay, Pinot blanc, and Riesling. The region also produces Cabernet Sauvignon, Gewürztraminer, Müller-Thurgau, Sémillon, and Zinfandel grapes, but in far smaller quantities.|$|E

5|$|The Umpqua Valley AVA {{contains}} the drainage basin of the Umpqua River, excluding mountainous regions. The Umpqua Valley has a warmer climate than the Willamette Valley, but is cooler than the Rogue Valley to the south. It {{is the oldest}} post-prohibition wine region in Oregon. Grapes grown here include Tempranillo, Baco noir, <b>Pinot</b> <b>noir,</b> Pinot gris, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and Riesling, Grüner Veltliner, {{and a host of}} lesser known Vitis vinifera. The region includes two sub-AVAs, the Red Hill Douglas County, Oregon AVA, a single vineyard AVA, as well as the Elkton Oregon AVA, which was established in early 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{most popular}} {{alcoholic}} drink in Switzerland is wine. Switzerland is notable for {{the variety of}} grapes grown {{because of the large}} variations in terroirs, with their specific mixes of soil, air, altitude and light. Swiss wine is produced mainly in Valais, Vaud (Lavaux), Geneva and Ticino, with a small majority of white wines. Vineyards have been cultivated in Switzerland since the Roman era, even though certain traces can be found of a more ancient origin. The most widespread varieties are the Chasselas (called Fendant in Valais) and <b>Pinot</b> <b>noir.</b> The Merlot is the main variety produced in Ticino.|$|E
5|$|While not as {{prolific}} in mutating as <b>Pinot</b> <b>noir,</b> nor {{as widely}} used in production of offspring, Cabernet Sauvignon {{has been linked to}} other grape varieties. In 1961, a cross of Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache produced the French wine grape Marselan. Cygne blanc is a white-berried seedling of Cabernet Sauvignon that was discovered in 1989 growing in a garden in Swan Valley, Western Australia. Cabernet blanc is a crossing of Cabernet Sauvignon and an unknown hybrid grape variety that was discovered in Switzerland in the late 20th century.|$|E

5000|$|Terret is {{an ancient}} Vitis vinifera vine that, like the parent Pinot vine of <b>Pinot</b> <b>noir's</b> history, mutated {{over the course of}} {{thousands}} of years into grape varieties of several color. Originating in the Languedoc-Roussillon wine of southern France, the descendents of Terret now include the red wine variety Terret noir, the white Terret blanc and the light-skinned Terret gris.|$|R
5|$|Most of {{the wine}} {{produced}} and consumed from the 1880s was sweet, kosher wine when the Carmel Winery was established, until the 1980s, when more dry or semi-dry wines began to be produced and consumed after {{the introduction of the}} Golan Heights Winery’s first vintage. The winery was the first to focus on planting and making wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, <b>Pinot</b> <b>noir,</b> white Riesling and Gewürztraminer. These wines are kosher and have won silver and gold medals in international competitions. Israeli wine is now produced by hundreds of wineries, ranging in size from small boutique wineries in the villages to large companies producing over ten million bottles per year, which are also exported worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The still wines of {{the area}} were highly prized in Paris under the {{designation}} of vins de la rivière and vins de la montagne- wines {{of the river and}} wines of the mountain in reference to the wooded terrain and the river Marne which carried the wines down to the Seine and into Paris. The region was in competition with Burgundy for the Flemish wine trade and tried to capitalize on Reims' location along the trade route from Beaune. In the 15th century, <b>Pinot</b> <b>noir</b> became heavily planted in the area. The resulting red wine had difficulty comparing well to the richness and coloring of Burgundy wines, despite the addition of elderberries to deepen the color. This led to a greater focus on white wines.|$|E
5|$|A luncheon at the U.S.Capitol {{has been}} part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the {{outgoing}} President and First Lady). The menu for the 2009 inaugural luncheon, which often features dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, included seafood stew, duck and pheasant entrees with <b>Pinot</b> <b>noir</b> wine, and a dessert of apple cinnamon sponge cake with sweet cream glacé. Since 1985, a painting has served as a backdrop for the head table. For the 2009 inaugural luncheon, the featured painting was Thomas Hill's 1865 View of the Yosemite Valley, a painting that commemorated Abraham Lincoln's 1864 signing of the Yosemite Grant, which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for public use.|$|E

Each year, the winery releases three to four Artist Series <b>Pinot</b> <b>Noirs</b> for which one of Frey's paintings is chosen for the label. To date, ten different Artist Series wines had been released.|$|R
5|$|Like {{other wines}} {{produced}} in the United States, Oregon wines are marketed as varietals. Oregon law requires that wines {{produced in the}} state must be identified by the grape variety from which it was made, and for most varietals it must contain at least 90% of that variety. The exceptions to the 90% law are the following varietals: Red and White Bordeaux varietals, Red and White Rhône varietals, Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Zinfandel and Tannat. For these wines, they follow the Federal guidelines of 75%. Oregon law has long forbidden use of place names, except as appellations of origin. Oregon is most famous for its <b>Pinot</b> <b>noir,</b> which is produced throughout the state. Pinot noirs from the Willamette Valley have received much critical acclaim from wine connoisseurs and critics, and Oregon is {{regarded as one of}} the premier Pinot-producing regions in the world.|$|E
5|$|The Columbia Gorge AVA {{is found}} in the Columbia Gorge. This region {{straddles}} the Columbia River, and thus lies in both Oregon and Washington; it is made up of Hood River and Wasco counties in Oregon, and Skamania and Klickitat counties in Washington. The region lies to the east of the summits of nearby Mount Hood and Mount Adams, situated in their rain shadows; thus, the region is significantly drier than the Willamette Valley. It also exhibits significant differences in elevation due to gorge geography, and strong winds common in the area also play a factor in the region's climate. This allows a wide variety of grapes to be grown in the Columbia Gorge. The region has nearly 40 vineyards, growing a wide variety of grapes, including Syrah, <b>Pinot</b> <b>noir,</b> Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot gris, Riesling, and Sangiovese.|$|E
5|$|With the {{continuing}} {{improvement in the}} region's winemaking reputation, enotourism in Oregon has become a significant industry in its own right. On-site sales are becoming an increasingly {{important part of the}} business of Oregon winemaking, and other businesses that cater to wine tourists, such as lodging, fine restaurants, art galleries, have been appearing in places like Dundee, many of which have long been rural farming communities. Wine festivals and tastings are commonplace. It is estimated that enotourism contributed USD $207.5 million to the state economy in 2013 excluding sales at wineries and tasting rooms. There are approximately 1.8 million visits to Oregon wineries each year, 59% by Oregonians and 41% from out of state visitors. Major events drawing significant numbers of tourists to wine country include the International <b>Pinot</b> <b>Noir</b> Celebration which is held the last weekend of July every year since 1987 and the more recent Oregon Chardonnay Celebration.|$|E
2500|$|With several {{vineyards}} and designated blocks, Bethel Heights {{has adopted}} the Burgundian practice of producing several different bottlings of <b>Pinot</b> <b>noirs</b> {{from the individual}} blocks and vineyards. Terry Casteel noted to Wine Spectator that they do this because the grapes from the different blocks [...] "...have distinct personalities, and they're complete wines." [...] Casteel also notes that the reputation of a vineyard is enhanced by vineyard designated wine more {{than they would be}} going into a wine with a more generic Oregon wine or Willamette Valley wine label.|$|R
5000|$|Cattier {{produces}} several Champagnes {{ranging from}} their standard non-vintage Premier Cru Brut to several limited special cuvées. [...] Varietal compositions range from 100% Chardonnay (a Blanc de blancs) to 75% dark-skinned <b>Pinots</b> (<b>noir</b> and Meunier) and 25% Chardonnay. Cattier is noted for producing several Champagnes in different bottle designs and colors, including a blue glass bottle with a pewter label, a red glass bottle (under the designation [...] "Red Kiss"), a gold-plated bottle designed by Pascal Morabito (under the designation Brut Sésame Millésimée), and a transparent bottle (under the designation Brut Quartz 1er Cru). Some bottles are sold with a metal-thread or arabesque golden-colored thread presentation case.|$|R
5000|$|Helfensteiner is a dark-skinned German {{wine grape}} {{crossing}} of the species Vitis vinifera, that was created in 1931 with the crossing of Frühburgunder (<b>Pinot</b> Précoce <b>noir)</b> and Trollinger (Schiava Grossa). It was created by August Herold at the grape breeding institute in Weinsberg in the Württemberg region.|$|R
25|$|<b>Pinot</b> <b>noir</b> is {{a popular}} grape variety all over Switzerland. In German-speaking regions of Switzerland it is often called Blauburgunder. <b>Pinot</b> <b>noir</b> wines are {{produced}} in Neuchâtel, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen and Bündner Herrschaft. In Valais, <b>Pinot</b> <b>noir</b> is also blended with Gamay to produce the well known Dôle.|$|E
25|$|Frühburgunder (<b>Pinot</b> <b>Noir</b> Précoce) is an early-{{ripening}} form of <b>Pinot</b> <b>noir.</b> Across the Pinot family, ripening {{in typical}} climates can be dispersed {{by as much}} as four, and even six, weeks between the very earliest (including Précoce) clones and the very latest ripening. Virus infection and excessive cropping significantly add to the delaying of <b>Pinot</b> <b>noir</b> ripening.|$|E
25|$|In Slovenia, the <b>pinot</b> <b>noir</b> is {{produced}} {{especially in the}} Slovenian Littoral, particularly in the Goriška Brda sub-region. In smaller amounts, the <b>Pinot</b> <b>noir</b> is also produced in Slovenian Styria.|$|E
2500|$|Oregon winemakers {{continued}} to win awards in the 1980s. In 1980, there thirty-four bonded Oregon wineries, and 115 growers with [...] planted. The 1980 vintage was greatly {{affected by the}} 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, and two wines from that vintage won gold medals in the 1982 International Wine Competition in London. Ponzi Vineyards of Beaverton was favorably covered by the New York Times in 1981. In 1984, noted wine critic Robert M. Parker, Jr. visited Oregon and was highly impressed with the Pinots he encountered. Oregon Pinots won further acclaim in the 1985 Burgundy Challenge, wherein wine experts could not distinguish between Oregon and Burgundy <b>Pinot</b> <b>noirs</b> in a blind taste test; in the rankings, the Oregon wines were rated ahead of the Burgundy entrants. Also in 1985, the Oregon wine industry received its first mention in Wine Spectator.|$|R
50|$|Ampelographers {{believe that}} Bouteillan noir {{is closely related}} to Provençal grape Colombaud but unlike <b>Pinot</b> blanc/Pinot <b>noir</b> and Grenache blanc/Grenache, the two grapes are {{distinct}} varieties and not color mutations of one or the other. Despite sharing several synonyms with the Languedoc grape Aramon and the Provençal grape Calitor, Bouteillan noir has no known relationship with either variety.|$|R
