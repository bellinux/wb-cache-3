5|$|In December 1984, the Taiwan Aboriginal People's Movement was {{launched}} {{when a group}} of aboriginal <b>political</b> <b>activists,</b> aided by the progressive Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT), established the Alliance of Taiwan Aborigines (ATA, or yuan chuan hui) to highlight the problems experienced by indigenous communities all over Taiwan, including: prostitution, economic disparity, land rights and official discrimination in the form of naming rights.|$|E

However, since the first decade of the 21st century, an increasing number of police and gendarmes have been prosecuted for improper conduct.|$|E

5|$|It attracts Catalan nationalists of many {{different}} viewpoints, including those attending a mass, <b>political</b> <b>activists</b> from the entire nationalist spectrum left and right giving speeches, organisations hosting stands and selling political books and souvenirs, and performers of traditional Catalan cultural activities such as sardana bands and dancers, castellers (human towers), and gegants (giant puppets). The gathering also marks {{the culmination of the}} four-day El Rebrot ("The Shoot") musical/political festival which has been held in Berga almost every year since 2001, organised by the Maulets/Arran left-wing youth organisation.|$|E
5|$|The Villalba attack inaugurated a {{long series}} of Mafia attacks in Sicily on <b>political</b> <b>activists,</b> trade union leaders and {{ordinary}} peasants resisting Mafia rule. In the following years many left-wing leaders were killed or otherwise attacked, culminating in the killing of 11 people and the wounding of over thirty at a May 1 labour parade in Portella della Ginestra. The Portella della Ginestra massacre was attributed to the bandit and separatist leader Salvatore Giuliano. Nevertheless, the Mafia was suspected of involvement in the bloodbath and many other attacks on left-wing organisations and leaders.|$|E
5|$|After 1995 the white-red-white flag {{is used as}} {{a symbol}} of the {{opposition}} to the regime of Alexander Lukashenko, most notably at the protests after the 2006 and 2010 presidential elections and at mass rallies on Freedom Day celebrations as well as Dziady memorial marches. The flag is not officially banned from public usage, but is treated by the authorities as an unregistered symbol which means that demonstration of it by <b>political</b> <b>activists</b> or sports fans can lead to arrests and confiscation of the flags. In early 2010, the political activist Siarhei Kavalenka was arrested for placing the white-red-white flag atop a Christmas tree on the central square of Vitsebsk. The court gave Kavalenka three years of suspended sentence which was followed by a second arrest and Kavalenka's several weeks long hunger strike. The hunger strike was interrupted by force-feeding on 16 January 2012.|$|E

5|$|Grimshaw {{was born}} in or around Great Harwood, Lancashire, in 1824 or 1825 {{and was one of}} six {{children}} brought up in a working-class family. His father, Thomas, had a reputation as a radical public speaker {{in the early part of}} the 19th century. Grimshaw initially worked as a cotton weaver before becoming a full-time activist and agitator. He first came to prominence in the village of Royton, near Oldham, in 1852 as a campaigner for the improvement and enforcement of the Factory Acts, to improve the working conditions of those employed in the cotton mills. In the same year he became editor of the anti-Whig broadsheet, the Royton Vindicator. He criticised the suppression of local <b>political</b> <b>activists</b> and supported the alliance of the Chartist movement with the Tories against the Whigs.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{policies}} and practices which resulted in individuals being punished for peacefully exercising their human rights by sending them to RTL have not fundamentally changed: quite the contrary. There is ample evidence that such policies and practices are continuing in full force. The latest anti-Falun Gong campaign, launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years, shows that the CCP’s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated. Falun Gong practitioners continue to be punished through criminal prosecution and being sent to “brainwashing centres” {{and other forms of}} arbitrary detention. Petitioners likewise continue to be subjected to harassment, forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to “black jails” and other forms of arbitrary detention. Human rights defenders, democracy advocates, whistle-blowers and other <b>political</b> <b>activists</b> are also being increasingly targeted through criminal detention, “black jails”, short-term administrative detention, and enforced disappearances, rather than RTL.|$|E
5|$|On 25 March 1971, the Pakistan Army {{launched}} {{military operations}} under Operation Searchlight against {{the population of}} East Pakistan. Dhaka bore {{the brunt of the}} army's atrocities, witnessing a genocide and a campaign of widescale repression, with the arrest, torture and murder of the city's civilians, students, intelligentsia, <b>political</b> <b>activists</b> and religious minorities. The army faced mutinies from the East Pakistan Rifles and the Bengali police. Large parts of the city were burnt and destroyed, including Hindu neighborhoods. Much of the city's population was either displaced or forced to flee to the countryside. In the ensuing Bangladesh War of Independence, the Bangladesh Forces launched regular guerrilla attacks and ambush operations against Pakistani forces. Dhaka was struck with numerous air raids by the Indian Air Force in December. Dhaka witnessed the surrender of the west Pakistan forces by Bangladesh-India Allied Forces on 16 December 1971 with the surrender of Pakistan.|$|E

5|$|Bryant became {{familiar}} with the socialist journal The Masses through Portland resident and lawyer C. E. S. Wood, who eventually married Field and who often contributed to the magazine. Enthusiastic about its contents, particularly articles by Portland native John Reed, Bryant began raising subscriptions for it. Emma Goldman, a well-known anarchist whom Wood had defended in court, gave a speech in Reed's honor at the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) hall in Portland. She and other <b>political</b> <b>activists,</b> such as Alexander Berkman, were among guests entertained by Bryant and her husband. In 1914, Reed, a Harvard graduate and established writer who by then lived in Greenwich Village, came home for a visit, during which he spoke at the University Club of Portland against the class system. Exactly how or when or how often Bryant and Reed met is uncertain, but near Christmas 1915 when Reed again came home to visit his widowed mother, the young couple announced their love at a dinner party. Reed returned to Greenwich Village on December 28, and Bryant, abandoning her marriage, followed him three days later. Trullinger filed for divorce, which was granted in July 1916, on grounds of desertion.|$|E
5|$|On 22January 1942, at the {{headquarters}} of the 1st Krajina Detachment in the village of Majkić Japra, Stojanović presided over a conference of the detachment staff and <b>political</b> <b>activists</b> of Grmeč. He criticised the detachment headquarters because it had no division of functions and there was no personal accountability among its members. He also stated {{the headquarters}} had no communication with the companies of the detachment, did not act as a military-political leadership, and there were no designated couriers available at all times {{at the headquarters}}. Stojanović was generally pleased with the Grmeč Partisans, describing them as courageous, enthusiastic, firm, and trustworthy but somewhat inexperienced. However, he said that the platoons of the detachment were dispersed in villages and had no contact with each other. In this way, according to Stojanović, the Partisans were losing their soldierly characteristics and becoming more like peasants. Stojanović criticised the views of some Partisans that political commissars should be abolished. He warned that the Partisans who wore emblems other than the red star would be punished for indiscipline.|$|E
