5|$|Treatment of meth mouth usually {{attempts}} to increase salivary flow, halt tooth decay, and encourage behavioral changes. Toothpaste with fluoride {{is very important}} to the restoration of dental health. Only prescription fluoride rinses can adequately treat the condition. Sialogogues, drugs that increase the amount of saliva in the mouth, can be used to treat dry mouth and protect against dental health problems. <b>Pilocarpine</b> and cevimeline are sialogogues approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat low salivation caused by Sjogren's syndrome and may have the potential to effectively treat dry mouth caused by methamphetamine use.|$|E
25|$|The {{antidote}} to atropine is physostigmine or <b>pilocarpine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{cyclosporine}} (Restasis) {{is available}} by prescription to help treat chronic dry eye by suppressing the inflammation that disrupts tear secretion. Prescription drugs {{are also available}} that help to stimulate salivary flow, such as cevimeline (Evoxac) and <b>pilocarpine.</b> Salagen, a manufactured form of <b>pilocarpine,</b> {{can be used to}} help produce tears, as well as saliva in the mouth and intestines. It is derived from the jaborandi plant.|$|E
25|$|Saliva stimulants – {{organic acids}} (ascorbic acid, malic acid), chewing gum, {{parasympathomimetic}} drugs (choline esters, e.g. <b>pilocarpine</b> hydrochloride, cholinesterase inhibitors), and other substances (sugar-free mints, nicotinamide).|$|E
25|$|Miotic agents (parasympathomimetics), such as <b>pilocarpine,</b> work by {{contraction}} of the ciliary muscle, opening the trabecular meshwork and allowing increased outflow of the aqueous humour. Echothiophate, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, {{is used in}} chronic glaucoma.|$|E
25|$|The first drug {{to reduce}} IOP, <b>pilocarpine,</b> was {{introduced}} in the 1870s. Early surgical techniques like iridectomy and fistulating methods have recently been supplemented by less invasive procedures like small implants, a range of options now widely called MIGS (micro-invasive glaucoma surgery).|$|E
25|$|Because {{medications}} {{have been}} linked to approximately 22% to 28% of all cases of dysgeusia, researching a treatment for this particular cause has been important. Xerostomia, or a decrease in saliva flow, can be a side effect of many drugs, which, in turn, can lead to the development of taste disturbances such as dysgeusia. Patients can lessen the effects of xerostomia with breath mints, sugarless gum, or lozenges, or physicians can increase saliva flow with artificial saliva or oral <b>pilocarpine.</b> Artificial saliva mimics the characteristics of natural saliva by lubricating and protecting the mouth but does not provide any digestive or enzymatic benefits. <b>Pilocarpine</b> is a cholinergic drug meaning it has the same effects as the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine has the function of stimulating the salivary glands to actively produce saliva. The increase in saliva flow is effective in improving the movement of tastants to the taste buds.|$|E
25|$|Saliva {{production}} may be pharmacologically {{stimulated by}} sialagogues such as <b>pilocarpine</b> and cevimeline. It {{can also be}} suppressed by so-called antisialagogues such as tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, antihypertensives, and polypharmacy. Cancer treatments including chemotherapy and radiation therapy may impair salivary flow. Radiation therapy may cause permanent hyposalivation due to injury to the oral mucosa containing the salivary glands, resulting in dry mouth or xerostomia, whereas chemotherapy may cause only temporary salivary impairment.|$|E
25|$|Once any {{symptoms}} {{have been}} controlled, {{the first line}} (and often definitive) treatment is laser iridotomy. This may be performed using either Nd:YAG or argon lasers, {{or in some cases}} by conventional incisional surgery. The goal of treatment is to reverse and prevent, contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork. In early to moderately advanced cases, iridotomy is successful in opening the angle in around 75% of cases. In the other 25%, laser iridoplasty, medication (<b>pilocarpine)</b> or incisional surgery may be required.|$|E
25|$|Toxic {{substances}} and poisons (like atropine) can {{significantly reduce the}} range of aperture. Pharmaceutical products such as eye drops may also cause similar side-effects. Tropicamide and phenylephrine are used in medicine as mydriatics to dilate pupils for retinal and lens examination. These medications take effect in about 30–45 minutes after instillation and last for about 8 hours. Atropine is also used {{in such a way}} but its effects can last up to 2 weeks, along with the mydriatic effect; it produces cycloplegia (a condition in which the crystalline lens of the eye cannot accommodate to focus near objects). This effect goes away after 8 hours. Other medications offer the contrary effect. <b>Pilocarpine</b> is a miotic (induces miosis); it can make a pupil as small as 1mm in diameter depending on the person and their ocular characteristics. Such drops are used in certain glaucoma patients to prevent acute glaucoma attacks.|$|E
25|$|Dysgeusia, {{also known}} as parageusia, is a {{distortion}} {{of the sense of}} taste. Dysgeusia is also often associated with ageusia, which is the complete lack of taste, and hypogeusia, which is a decrease in taste sensitivity. An alteration in taste or smell may be a secondary process in various disease states, or it may be the primary symptom. The distortion in the sense of taste is the only symptom, and diagnosis is usually complicated since the sense of taste is tied together with other sensory systems. Common causes of dysgeusia include chemotherapy, asthma treatment with albuterol, and zinc deficiency. Different drugs could also be responsible for altering taste and resulting in dysgeusia. Due to the variety of causes of dysgeusia, there are many possible treatments that are effective in alleviating or terminating the symptoms of dysgeusia. These include artificial saliva, <b>pilocarpine,</b> zinc supplementation, alterations in drug therapy, and alpha lipoic acid.|$|E
25|$|Catecholamine receptors {{persisted in}} this {{wavering}} state {{for more than}} forty years. Additional blocking agents were found such as tolazoline in Switzerland and phenoxybenzamine in the United States, but like the ergot alkaloids they blocked only the smooth muscle excitatory receptors. Additional agonists also were synthesized. Outstanding among them became isoprenaline, N-isopropyl-noradrenaline, of Boehringer Ingelheim, studied pharmacologically along with adrenaline and other N-substituted noradrenaline derivatives by Richard Rössler (1897–1945) and Heribert Konzett (1912–2004) in Vienna. The Viennese pharmacologists used their own Konzett-Rössler test to examine bronchodilation. Intravenous injection of <b>pilocarpine</b> to induce bronchospasm was followed by intravenous injection of the agonists. “Arrangement of all amines according to their bronchodilator effect yields a series from the most potent, isopropyl-adrenaline, via the approximately equipotent bodies adrenaline, propyl-adrenaline and butyl-adrenaline, to the weakly active isobutyl-adrenaline.” Isoprenaline also exerted marked positive chronotropic and inotropic effects. Boehringer introduced it for use in asthma in 1940. After the war it became available to Germany’s former enemies {{and over the years}} was traded under about 50 names. In addition to this therapeutic success {{it was one of the}} agonists with which Raymond P. Ahlquist solved the ″myoneural junction″ riddle. “By virtue of this property the reputation of the substance spread all over the world and it became a tool for many investigations on different aspects of pharmacology and therapeutics.” The story had a dark side: overdosage caused numerous deaths due to cardiac side effects, an estaimated three thousands in the United Kingdom alone.|$|E
25|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} may {{be diagnosed}} by many different methods, including newborn screening, sweat testing, and genetic testing. As of 2006 in the United States, 10% of cases are diagnosed shortly after birth {{as part of}} newborn screening programs. The newborn screen initially measures for raised blood concentration of immunoreactive trypsinogen. Infants with an abnormal newborn screen need a sweat test to confirm the CF diagnosis. In many cases, a parent makes the diagnosis because the infant tastes salty. Immunoreactive trypsinogen levels can be increased in individuals who have a single mutated copy of the CFTR gene (carriers) or, in rare instances, in individuals with two normal copies of the CFTR gene. Due to these false positives, CF screening in newborns can be controversial. Most U.S. states and countries do not screen for CF routinely at birth. Therefore, most individuals are diagnosed after symptoms (e.g. sinopulmonary disease and GI manifestations) prompt an evaluation for cystic fibrosis. The most commonly used form of testing is the sweat test. Sweat testing involves application of a medication that stimulates sweating (<b>pilocarpine).</b> To deliver the medication through the skin, iontophoresis is used, whereby one electrode is placed onto the applied medication and an electric current is passed to a separate electrode on the skin. The resultant sweat is then collected on filter paper or in a capillary tube and analyzed for abnormal amounts of sodium and chloride. People with CF have increased amounts {{of them in their}} sweat. In contrast, people with CF have less thiocyanate and hypothiocyanite in their saliva and mucus (Banfi et al.). In the case of milder forms of CF, transepithelial potential difference measurements can be helpful. CF can also be diagnosed by identification of mutations in the CFTR gene.|$|E

2500|$|Saliva {{substitutes}} {{can improve}} xerostomia, but {{tend not to}} improve the other problems associated with salivary gland dysfunction. Parasympathomimitic drugs (saliva stimulants) such as <b>pilocarpine</b> may improve xerostomia symptoms and other problems associated with salivary gland dysfunction, but the evidence for treatment of radiation-induced xerostomia is limited. Both stimulants and substitutes relieve symptoms to some extent. [...] Salivary stimulants are probably only useful in people with some remaining detectable salivary function. A systematic review of the treatment of dry mouth found no strong {{evidence to suggest that}} a specific topical therapy is effective. The review reported limited evidence that oxygenated glycerol triester spray was more effective than electrolyte sprays. Sugar free chewing gum increases saliva production but there is no strong evidence that it improves symptoms. There is a suggestion that intraoral devices and integrated mouthcare systems may be effective in reducing symptoms, but {{there was a lack of}} strong evidence. A systematic review of the management of radiotherapy induced xerostomia with parasympathomimetic drugs found that there was limited evidence to support the use of <b>pilocarpine</b> in the treatment of radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction. It was suggested that, barring any contraindications, a trial of the drug be offered in the above group (at a dose of five mg three times per day to minimize side effects). Improvements can take up to twelve weeks. However, <b>pilocarpine</b> is not always successful in improving xerostomia symptoms. The review also concluded that there was little evidence to support the use of other parasympathomimetics in this group.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{study was}} {{conducted}} concerning an effect by the mothers of the flesh fly population. [...] There is a maternal effect that operates in S. bullata that can prevent pupal diapause when reared under short day conditions. It was determined that certain environmental stressors or chemical treatments on the mother, such as extreme temperature shocks, food deprivation and reducing maternal size, were ineffective in altering the diapause-suppressant. However, there were several chemical agents that proved effective. Gamma-aminobutyric acid, octopamine and <b>pilocarpine</b> all countered the maternal affect and permitted the expression of diapause in the flesh fly progeny. [...] The ability to express diapause is an important consideration for forensic entomologists as diapause allows the pupae to become metabollically [...] "dormant" [...] until environmental conditions improve; this would significantly affect pupal time estimations and subsequent post-mortem interval estimations.|$|E
5000|$|Sweating is {{induced by}} <b>pilocarpine</b> iontophoresis. [...] At the test site, an {{electrode}} is placed over gauze containing <b>pilocarpine</b> and electrolyte solution {{that will not}} interfere with the sodium and chloride measurement. A second electrode (without <b>pilocarpine)</b> will be placed at another site and a mild electric current will draw the <b>pilocarpine</b> into the skin where it stimulates the sweat glands.|$|E
50|$|In ophthalmology, <b>pilocarpine</b> is {{also used}} to reduce the {{possibility}} of glare at night from lights when the patient has undergone implantation of phakic intraocular lenses; the use of <b>pilocarpine</b> would reduce the size of the pupils, relieving these symptoms.
