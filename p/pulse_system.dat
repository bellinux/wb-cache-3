40|$|Positron {{lifetime}} spectroscopy is {{a powerful}} tool to identify vacancy type defects in semiconductor materials. Conventionally, applicability of the positron lifetime measurement has been limited to bulk samples. However, many interesting materials are nowadays available only as thin epitaxial samples. In order to measure these samples a positron lifetime beam is needed. This work describes the concept and {{the design of a}} pulsed low-energy positron lifetime beam facility. The theoretical background of the beam pulsing is reviewed. The construction of the <b>pulsing</b> <b>system</b> is presented in detail and results from electron and positron tests with this beam facility are introduced. As an application of the pulsed lifetime beam the results of the measurements on InN layers done at Universität der Bundeswehr are also presented. The <b>pulsing</b> <b>system</b> in this work is composed of three different components, two bunchers and a chopper. The bunchers modulate the beam velocity to create a time varying positron beam intensity and to result a very narrow positron bunch at the target. The chopper is used {{to get rid of the}} background between the pulses and to improve the peak to background ratio. When this <b>pulsing</b> <b>system</b> is tested with electrons, a full width at half maximum of 160  ps and a peak to background ratio of 5000 : 1 is obtained.

40|$|In {{the high}} {{gradient}} electron linacs at X or S band, a conventional klystropn driver cannnot supply short pulses that a linear collider operation requires. Therefore, some RF <b>pulse</b> compression <b>system</b> that can compress the RF pulse length {{and at the}} same time heighten the peak RF power become necessary. Such an RF <b>pulse</b> compression <b>system</b> has been already utelized successfully in the S-band electron linacs of several laboratories. In the studies of the X-band linear accelerators, such RF <b>pulse</b> compression <b>systems,</b> SLED (SLAC Linac Energy Doubler) [1] or its direct successors SLED 2 [2] and VPM (VLEPP Pulse Multiplier) [3][4] were studied and developed as the RF <b>pulse</b> compression <b>system</b> for the future machines. These system are all based on the same principle that the RF pulse energy is once stored in some storage circuit (a resonance cavity or a delay line) and thereafter emitted within short time to create the shorter RF pulse. Instead of these schemes, BPC (Binary Pulse Conpression) [5] and DLDS (Delay Line Distribution System) [6] use the delay lines as the tool to make the RF pulse shorter (BPC), or to adapt the longer RF pulse into the shorter linac driving pulse (in case of DLDS). A DLDS was recently introduced as an RF <b>pulse</b> compression equivalent <b>system</b> based on the different operation principle from an ordinary <b>pulse</b> compression <b>system.</b> DLDS is expected as the RF <b>pulse</b> compression equivalent <b>system</b> for the future RF system of X-band linear colliders. ...|$|R

50|$|The first {{advantage}} the ASR-11 offers {{is the use}} of a low-peak, {{solid state}} transmitter with pulse compression technology, replacing the ASR-9's high peak, short pulse power system. This gives the radar the ability to provide the same amount of energy to a target at long range while making the radar less sensitive at shorter ranges. Any aircraft that comes closer than six nautical miles from the radar cannot be located with the long range <b>pulse</b> <b>system</b> built into the ASR-11. Installing additional radar equipment to the same antenna is required for close range location and weather detection. The second advantage of using an ASR-11 is the radars ability to utilize a pulse sequence diversity. This gives the radar system the capability to limit processing dwells to a small number of pulses. This feature becomes most important when monitoring air traffic is the primary use of the radar. Reducing the number of pulses sent out by the radar system also has a direct effect on the Doppler resolution, resulting in a decreased ability to process live weather conditions.|$|E
40|$|Pulse diagnosis, {{recognized}} as an important branch of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), {{has a long history}} for health diagnosis. Certain features in the pulse are known to be related with the physiological status, which have been identified as biomarkers. In recent years, an electronic equipment is designed to obtain the valuable information inside pulse. Single-point pulse acquisition platform has the benefit of low cost and flexibility, but is time consuming in operation and not standardized in pulse location. The <b>pulse</b> <b>system</b> with a single-type sensor is easy to implement, but is limited in extracting sufficient pulse information. This paper proposes a novel system with optimal design that is special for pulse diagnosis. We combine a pressure sensor with a photoelectric sensor array to make a multichannel sensor fusion structure. Then, the optimal pulse signal processing methods and sensor fusion strategy are introduced for the feature extraction. Finally, the developed optimal <b>pulse</b> <b>system</b> and methods are tested on pulse database acquired from the healthy subjects and the patients known to be afflicted with diabetes. The experimental results indicate that the classification accuracy is increased significantly under the optimal design and also demonstrate that the developed <b>pulse</b> <b>system</b> with multichannel sensors fusion is more effective than the previous pulse acquisition platforms.

40|$|Abstract. The {{method of}} {{calculation}} of heating of metal in the thermal furnace taking into account <b>pulse</b> <b>system</b> of heating is presented in article. The experimental dataobtained on the pusher furnace, heated by high-speed recuperative torches with <b>pulse</b> <b>system</b> of burning of fuel are submitted. The current state of computer facilities and means of software allows receiving sufficiently exact and extensive information about various thermal processes, and reduces terms and costs of development of the rational thermal modes. In turn, the complexity of calculations of heating of metal in furnaces with <b>pulse</b> <b>system</b> of heating takes place. It is connected with that that the conditions of radiant heat exchange included in the basis of many mathematical models about constancy of temperature in all considered volume (furnaces, zones) doesn't reflect the specific situation, in particular, at an initial site of heating. At the same time, the surface perceiving thermal radiation will lead to consideration of objects of this type {{from the point of}} view of the radiating system with a large number of sources of radiation to that that such engineering calculation procedure will gain undesirable bulkiness and lose its efficiency.

40|$|THE {{whistleblower}} at {{the centre}} of the quashed penalty points controversy has compiled a 350 -page dossier alleging a litany of more serious offences that he believes have gone unpunished due to garda malpractice. The damning report, seen by the Sunday Independent, claims that hundreds of crimes – including sexual assaults, drug charges, public order offences and breaches of the intoxicating liquor act – have not been properly investigated by gardai. It also alleges that almost 500 driving with no insurance charges and at least 150 dangerous driving offences were not followed up by members of the force despite being recorded in the garda <b>pulse</b> <b>system.</b> The dossier, compiled by a serving garda sergeant, details offences in one garda division between 2008 and 2010 and is said to be supported with documentary evidence from the <b>pulse</b> <b>system.</b> The whistleblower alleges that hundreds of charges were initially entered into the <b>pulse</b> <b>system</b> and marked "detected" but no court summons was issued and the records were later marked "undetected".
