40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of oral supplementation with ursodeoxycholate (UDCA) or tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA) on the lipid content and fatty acid {{composition}} of rat hepatic microsomes. UDCA and TUDCA significantly increased {{the total amount of}} lipids with the exception of cholesteryl-esters. UDCA significantly increased the triglycerides and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) microsomal content, and decreased the cholesterol/phospholipids and the phosphatidylcholine (PC) /PE ratio. Both treatments increased the <b>percentage</b> <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> and of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in each class of lipids. UDCA and TUDCA had a different action on PUFA microsomal molar percentage of phospholipids: UDCA increased the relative percentage of PUFA in the PE fraction, while TUDCA increased the relative percentage of PUFA in the PC fraction. These changes in the hepatic lipid content and composition might in part explain both cytoprotective action of these hydrophillic bile acids and their effect on membrane fluidity...|$|E

How we choose the kind of oil that we will buy when {{we are in a}} supermarket? Depending on colour, smell or ingredient? In this case, I became curious about the difference between different kinds of oil and wanted to search for it. After a brief research from supermarkets and Internet I realizied that the amount of oleic acid varies in different types of oil. I preferred to buy Kırlangıç and Kristal brands and 4 different types of oil which included the information about the amount of <b>percentage</b> <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> amount {{at the back of the}} bottles. This values would be my literature value which I could compare with my values. Oleic acid is a kind of unsaturated acid which exist in different amount in each oil. As oleic acid is a type of weak acid, the most outstanding method is acid-base titration to find the amount in the oil. This experiment could have been done with other methods but I have chosen to use acid-base titration method because I wanted to do the experiment in school laboratory and school opportunities enabled me to do titration method. In order to investigate the introduced topic and find the values of oleic acid my research question is shaped as; what is the difference in oleic acid amounts for different types of oil? Related to my research topic, I also investigated the accuracy and precision of the brands Kristal and Kırlangıç. As a consequence of this experiment, I proved that oleic acid amounts of different oils are distinct. According to this; it is seen that different oils have divergent and various affects on human health...|$|E
40|$|Background Many {{health effects}} of oils rich in <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> (18 : 1 n 9) seem to be {{opposite}} those of arachidonic acid (20 : 4 n 6), i. e. concerning cardiovascular risk. In recent study in rats we observed that <b>percentages</b> of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> and arachidonic acid were inversely related in total serum lipids. In the present work we investigate whether an inverse relationship between this couple of fatty acids also exists in the phospholipid fraction of human sera. Methods The study group consisted of 11 men and 35 women. Mean age was 23. 8 [*]±[*] 2. 5  years (mean[*]±[*]SD), and the body mass index was 23. 5 [*]±[*] 3. 2  kg/m 2. After fasting overnight, blood was drawn and the concentration of fatty acids in serum phospholipids was determined, using gas chromatography. We studied the association between <b>percentages</b> of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> and arachidonic acid using bivariate correlations (Pearson), and multiple linear regressions. Results We found an inverse relationship (r[*]=[*]− 0. 563, p[*]<[*] 0. 001; n[*]=[*] 46) between % <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> and % arachidonic acid in the serum phosholipid fraction of the 46 fasting subjects. By multiple linear regression, and % 20 : 4 n 6 as the dependent variable, the inverse association with % 18 : 1 n 9 persisted when controlling for sex, age, body mass index, and percentages of the other fatty acids measured (t[*]=[*]− 17. 6, p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Per cent 20 : 4 n 6 seemed to correlate negatively (r[*]=[*]− 0. 289, p[*]=[*] 0. 05) with the (18 : 1 n 9) /(18 : 0) ratio, estimating Delta 9 desaturase activity, and % <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> correlated negatively (r[*]=[*]− 0. 321, p[*]=[*] 0. 029) with the (20 : 4) /(18 : 2) ratio, estimating desaturases/elongase activities. Conclusions In a group of healthy human subjects, <b>percentages</b> of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> and arachidonic acid were inversely related, and the inverse association persisted when controlling for possible confounding variables.

40|$|Three {{different}} polyester polyols, {{with various}} <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> content, {{were used in}} the preparation of polyurethane (PUR) coatings. The polyols were designated as Alk 28, Alk 40, and Alk 65, in which 28, 40, and 65 represent the <b>percentage</b> of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> of the polyol formulations. These polyester polyols were reacted with aromatic diisocyanate toluene diisocyanate (TDI) to form PUR coatings. The acid value, hydroxyl value, molecular weight, and viscosity of the polyols have been determined. The reaction between the polyols and TDI was studied by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The effects of varying NCO/OH ratio and <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> content of polyols on physical and mechanical properties of PUR films were studied. XRD results indicate that the samples are amorphous. PURs, made with Alk 28, have the best mechanical properties followed by Alk 40 and Alk 65.

40|$|Oxidation of low density lipoproteins from {{patients}} with renal failure or a renal transplant. Peroxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) {{may be involved}} in the development of atherosclerosis which is prevalent in patients with chronic renal failure and renal transplant recipients. We determined the copper ion catalyzed oxidation in vitro, vitamin E content, and chemical and fatty acid composition of LDL isolated from 38 patients with renal disease and 15 healthy subjects. Also the acute effect of hemodialysis treatment on LDL oxidation variables was tested. The lag time in conjugated diene formation during oxidation was significantly (P = 0. 011) shorter in LDL from renal transplant recipients (66 min, N = 18) mainly due to significantly (P < 0. 05) snorter times in women (47 min, N = 7), compared with healthy subjects (83 min, N = 15), patients on hemodialysis (91 min, N = 13) and patients treated by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (82 min, N = 7). The maximum rate and the extent of LDL oxidation were significantly (P < 0. 01) lower in all patients with renal disease compared with healthy subjects. The triglyceride content of LDL was significantly (P < 0. 001) higher in women with kidney grafts (7. 3 %) compared with levels in the corresponding men (5. 3 %) and healthy women (5. 0 %), and was correlated significantly with the lag time in LDL oxidation in renal transplant recipients (Spearmans r = - 0. 502, P = 0. 034). The <b>percentage</b> <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> in LDL was significantly higher (P = 0. 002) and the percentage linoleic acid was significantly lower (P = 0. 046) in patients with renal disease, and may largely account for their lower rates and extent of LDL oxidation. Levels of the LDL oxidation variables and organic lipid peroxide content of LDL were not significantly different before and after hemodialysis and 24 hours later. These results suggest that LDL from women with renal transplants may be abnormally susceptible to oxidation possibly due to increased triglyceride content...|$|E

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF JOSHUA GUNTHER, for the Masters of Science {{degree in}} Plant, Soil and Agricultural Systems, {{presented}} on November 2 nd, 2015, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: DEVELOPING CHEMICALLY MUTAGENIZED EMS FORREST SOYBEAN POPULATION FOR HIGH OIL PROFILE. MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Khalid Meksem SUPERVISOR: Dr. Naoufal Lakhssassi Soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) {{are the most}} important crop that provides a sustainable source of oil and protein worldwide. Five major fatty acids are known, Palmetic, Stearic, Oleic, Linoleic and Linolenic acid, and each is essential for both nutrition and biodiesel. Oil demand for biodiesel production is constantly on the rise both because of high crude oil prices and because of the search for a sustainable fuel source. In biodiesel production a high level of <b>Oleic</b> <b>Acid</b> is ideal. Commodity soybean oil usually contains around 20 % <b>oleic</b> <b>acid.</b> The objective of this research is to increase the <b>Oleic</b> <b>acid</b> content to increase the quantity of biodiesel that can be produced from one bushel of soybeans. With the process of chemical mutagenesis using Ethyl Methanesulfonate (EMS), soybean populations can be produced with varying fatty acid levels. Once these populations are isolated and tested they can be bred into a new cultivar with higher <b>percentages</b> of <b>Oleic</b> <b>acid</b> and grown on a large scale for biodiesel production. From the ‘Forrest’ cultivar that was used in the chemical mutagenesis process, there was one mutant line (FM 3 2014 - 2031) that produced 43. 26 % <b>Oleic</b> <b>Acid.</b> This was almost twice the concentration of the Forrest wild type that was used as a control which had an <b>Oleic</b> <b>Acid</b> concentration of 23. 17 %...|$|R
40|$|A {{chemical}} reaction chamber {{system has been}} developed for the processing of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> aerosol particles with ozone under two relative humidity conditions: dry and humidified to 65  %. The apparatus consists of an aerosol flow tube, in which the ozonolysis occurs, coupled to a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) and an aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ATOFMS) which measure the evolving particle size and composition. Under both relative humidity conditions, ozonolysis results in {{a significant decrease in}} particle size and mass which is consistent with the formation of volatile products that partition from the particle to the gas phase. Mass spectra derived from the ATOFMS reveal the presence of the typically observed reaction products: azelaic acid, nonanal, oxononanoic acid and nonanoic acid, as well as a range of higher molecular weight products deriving from the reactions of reaction intermediates with <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> and its oxidation products. These include octanoic acid and 9 - and 10 -oxooctadecanoic acid, as well as products of considerably higher molecular weight. Quantitative evaluation of product yields with the ATOFMS shows a marked dependence upon both particle size association (from 0. 3 to 2. 1  µm diameter) and relative humidity. Under both relative humidity conditions, the <b>percentage</b> residual of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> increases with increasing particle size and the main lower molecular weight products are nonanal and oxononanoic acid. Under dry conditions, the percentage of higher molecular weight products increases with increasing particle size due to the poorer internal mixing of the larger particles. Under humidified conditions, the <b>percentage</b> of unreacted <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> is greater, except in the smallest particle fraction, with little formation of high molecular weight products relative to the dry particles. It is postulated that water reacts with reactive intermediates, competing with the processes which produce high molecular weight products. Whilst the <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> model aerosol system is of limited relevance to complex internally mixed atmospheric aerosol, the generic findings presented in this paper give useful insights into the nature of heterogeneous chemical processes...|$|R

This nutrient is difficult to digests by the birds and need to be broken down. Specific enzymes can be used to break the cellulose to improve the nutritional value of the pits. As a result, energy may be released and utilized by the birds. Having this in mind, an experiment was conducted using 4 levels of ground date pits; 0, 5, 10 and 15 % with or without added enzymes and studied the effect on performance of the birds and the fatty acids content of the egg. The experiment was lasted for 12 to 2 week periods. The results of the chemical analysis showed that date fats contain high <b>percentage</b> of <b>Oleic</b> <b>Acid</b> which may have contributed to higher level of this fat in egg yolk of birds treated with date pits.

With regard to the microflora of technological interest, Yeast were the only population which significantly increases during the seasoning of p-series products, presumably influencing the increase of FFA which reached the highest concentration (5. 75 % oleic acid/TF) {{at the same time}} in which Yeasts reached maximum population density (17 th day) ...|$|R

The flesh of shark Caracharhinus spp. n 3 thalapath Istiophorus spp. n 3 were also analyzed for water-soluble protein content. Peptide-mapping was also carried {{out for the}} water-soluble protein fraction of all three types of samples. Moreoverthe sub-samples n 3 of the crab meat samples and commercial fish oil samples n 3 were also analyzed for fatty acid profile and content using gas chromatography. The results of proximate analysis revealed a composition of 89. 40. 072 mean SE moisture 75. 70. 069 protein 13. 00. 002 ash and 02. 20. 047 fat in crab meat. The analysis water-soluble fraction revealed species-specific patterns on SDS-PAGE demonstrating greater amounts of myosin heavy chain and fimbrin {{compared to that of}} shark and thalapath flesh. As it was expected a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids were found in crab oil representing 40. 68 of the total fatty acid content. The fatty acid profile exhibited greater <b>percentages</b> of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> 28. 03 and eicosapentaenoic acid EPA 12. 12 when compared to existing data related to that of commercial fish oil. In conclusion the study revealed high protein content and a low fat content in the meat of P. pelagicus. The water-soluble protein profile meat of P. pelagicus could possibly be differentiated by peptide mapping which shows thick bands for the myosin heavy chain MHC and fimbrin. Oil of P. pelagicus carries relatively greater amounts of EPA and <b>oleic</b> <b>acid.</b> Thus the consumption of crabs would help to prevent nutritional deficiencies in the future...|$|R

40|$|Fatty acid {{composition}} of various lipids isolated and fractionated from rat incisor pulps {{were analyzed by}} means of thin layer and gas chromatography. The changes of the compositions after whole body X-irradiation were also investigated. The results are as follows. 1) The fatty acid {{composition of}} total lipid from rat incisor pulps {{was similar to that}} of total lipids from rat incisor (hard tissue). 2) Palmitic, oleic, stearic and arachidonic acids, in that order, accounted for most of the fatty acids (> 88 %) in total lipid. In the irradiated group (at 3 days after whole body irradiation), <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> had decreased and arachidonic acid had increased. 3) The fatty acids of phospholipid were found in the order, palmitic, stearic, <b>oleic</b> and arachidonic <b>acids.</b> After irradiation, the <b>percentage</b> of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> decreased and that of arachidonic acid increased. 4) Similarly, the fatty acids of triglyceride and cholesterol ester were in the order, palmitic, stearic, myristic, <b>oleic</b> and palmitoleic <b>acid,</b> and palmitic acid accounted for 60 %. Saturated fatty acids accounted for over 80 % of both lipid fractions and arachidonic acid was a trace component. After irradiation, the changes of fatty acid composition of both lipid fractions were different. A decrease in palmitoleic acid and an increase in myristic acid in the compositions of triglyceride were observed. On the other hand, a decrease in stearic and palmitoleic acids and an increase in myristic acid were observed in cholesterol ester. 5) The fatty acids of phosphatidyl-choline (a), ethanolamine (b) and serine (c) were in the orders; (a) palmitic, oleic, stearic and arachidonic acid; (b) stearic, oleic, palmitic and arachidonic acid; and (c) palmitic, <b>oleic</b> and stearic <b>acid.</b> Arachidonic acid in phosphatidyl choline and ethanolamine accounted for a high percentage of the composition, but was low in phosphatidyl serine.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to carry out {{physicochemical}} analysis and to evaluate the fatty acid composition of imported olive cultivators. Oils were extracted from cultivars Leccino and Coratina which are being cultivated in two districts of Balochistan province. Physicochemical properties of the oils were boiling point, 286 - 290 °C; melting point, - 5. 3 to - 6. 8 °C; refractive index (25 °C), 1. 63 - 1. 98; iodine value, 64 - 72 / 100 [*]g of oil; acid value, 0. 27 - 0. 89 [*]mg of KOH/g of oil; saponification number mg KOH/g of oil, 186. 4 - 198. 7; and specific gravity, 0. 89 - 0. 93 respectively. Fatty acids which are commonly present in olive oils were analyzed using Gas Chromatograph. The results obtained showed the presence of varied quantities of fatty acids (stearic, arachidic, linoleic, oleic, linolenic, palmitics, palmitoleic). A high <b>percentage</b> of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> (61. 56 - 67. 43 %) was found, followed by palmitic acid (13. 60 - 17. 61 %), linoleic acid (12. 23 - 14. 45 %), and stearic acid (1. 40 - 2. 68 %) respectively in cultivars from both districts. Physicochemical quality and fatty acid composition of the extracted oils were in conformity with International Olive Oil Council (IOOC). The study concluded that both olive cultivars demonstrated promising physicochemical properties and fatty acid composition. This could be useful as edible oil and would have industrial applications.

40|$|In this paper, a novel voltammetric/amperometric {{approach}} for the direct determination of free acidity (FFA, expressed as mass <b>percentage</b> of free <b>oleic</b> <b>acid)</b> {{in olive oil}} samples is presented. The method {{is based on the}} reduction processes occurring at a platinum microdisk electrode involving the free fatty acids present in the matrices. To overcome problems related to the low conductivity of the samples investigated, olive oils were mixed with suitable amounts of the room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL), tri-hexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([P 14, 6, 6, 6](+) [NTf 2](-)), which acted as a supporting electrolyte. Conditions for a reliable quantification of the acids were preliminarily investigated by performing voltammetric and chronoamperometric measurements in RTIL solutions containing <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> at different concentrations. <b>Oleic</b> <b>acid</b> (OA) was chosen as a model compound as it is the main component of the FFA content in olive oils. In order to establish the effect of oxygen on the electroanalytical responses, the reduction process of OA was investigated under both deoxygenated and oxygenated conditions. It was found that, in both situations, the current arising from the electrode process of OA depended linearly on the OA concentration over a wide range varying from 0. 1 % to 8 % OA (w/w). This range includes FFA values which can be found on all categories of commercially available oil samples, including extra-virgin, virgin and lampante oils. Voltammetric and chronoamperometric experiments were also performed in oil/RTIL samples artificially acidified (extra-virgin olive oils with known addition of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid)</b> and in natural olive oils from some commercial categories. The results obtained indicated that the electrochemical procedure developed was satisfactory in terms of both sensitivity and detection limits. The reliability of the proposed {{approach for}} the detection of FFA was finally assessed by comparison of the voltammetric/chronoamperometric values with those obtained by the official method for quantification of olive oil acidity, which is an acid/base volumetric titration...|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} {{and structure of}} triacylglycerols (TAGs) and partial glycerides of crude palm oil obtained from interspecific hybrid Elaeis oleifera × Elaeis guineensis, grown in Colombia, were fully characterised and compared to data obtained by analysing crude African palm oil. Hybridisation appears to substantially modify the biosynthesis of fatty acids (FAs) rather than their assembly in TAGs. In fact, total FAs analysis showed significant differences between {{these two types of}} oil, with hybrid palm oil having a higher <b>percentage</b> of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> (54. 6 ± 1. 0 vs 41. 4 ± 0. 3), together with a lower saturated fatty acid content (33. 5 ± 0. 5 vs 47. 3 ± 0. 1), while the percentage of essential fatty acid, linoleic acid, does not undergo significant changes. Furthermore, 34 TAG types were identified, with no qualitative differences between African and E. guineensis × E. oleifera hybrid palm oil samples. Short and medium chain FAs (8 : 0, 10 : 0, 12 : 0, 14 : 0) were utilised, together, to build a restricted number of TAG molecular species. Oil samples from the E. guineensis × E. oleifera hybrid showed higher contents of monosaturated TAGs (47. 5 - 51. 0 % vs 36. 7 - 37. 1 %) and triunsaturated TAGs (15. 5 - 15. 6 % vs 5. 2 - 5. 4 %). The sn- 2 position of TAGs in hybrid palm oil was shown to be predominantly esterified with <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> (64. 7 - 66. 0 mol% vs 55. 1 - 58. 2 mol% in African palm oil) with only 10 - 15 % of total palmitic acid and 6 - 20 % of stearic acid acylated in the secondary position. The total amount of diacylglycerols (DAGs) was in agreement with the values of free acidity; DAG types found were in agreement with the representativeness of different TAG species. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To {{be considered in the}} study, data for the cultivar had to be present from {{at least two of the}} five study years. Samples (around 15 kg) of fruits at ripening stage were harvested to produce the investigated oils by utilising a laboratory oil mill, which were then analysed according to the official analysis methods, Reg. C. E. E. 2568 / 91 and E. U. modifications. Extreme variability characterized the percentages of each FA, making each cultivar "peculiar" in its TAG composition. In the same year (e. g. 2003), the <b>percentage</b> of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> increased from a minimum of 49. 8 % (cv. Orbetana) to 78. 2 % (cv. Simona) and the percentage of linoleic acid ranged from 3. 9 % (cv. Simona) to 23. 9 % (cv. Racioppella), a variation of more than 500 %. The year effect is evident, despite the large number of samples in each year: <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> varied from 67. 5 % in 2003 to 73. 4 % in 2005 and important differences can also be noted for palmitic and linoleic acid averages. Temperature from stone hardening until the beginning of turning colour is probably the primary contributing factor with regard to these variations. A linear regression between the thermal sums accumulated in this period and the levels of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> shows a decrease in the percentage of this FA with an increase in the GDD. The ternary plot system presents a different distribution of the data from the 69 cultivars in 2003 (warmest year) and 2005 (coolest year) relative to three groups of FAs (SFAs, MFAs and PFAs). The lowering of the percentage of MFA groups and the prevalent tendency to increase the SFAs is evident, with important movement also in the zone of increasing PFA group. Grouping the possible tendencies of different cultivars is evaluated by a "fuzzy" clustering analysis, dividing the population into three "groups": in two of them the MFA amounts decrease, substituted mainly by SFAs (the first and most conspicuous cluster) or by PFAs (second cluster); an inconspicuous but notable cluster constituted by three cultivars only, characterized by a practically constant level of MFAs, with the effect of the warm year on lowering PFAs, is also highlighted...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} the dietary protein levels on liver lipids of the male rats were {{examined}} using 8, 20 and 32 % casein diets. Feeding a diet of 8 % casein resulted in considerably lower level of hepatic phospholipids in comparisons to that of 20 and 32 % casein. Modification of the fatty acid compositions of several lipid components tested was reflected in general by the levels of dietary casein. There was, however, no obvious differences in these parameters between 20 and 32 % casein diets. When comparisons were made between 8 and 32 % casein diets, ingestion of the lower dietary protein caused the decreased percentage of arachidonic acid and the increased percentage of palmitic and palmitoleic acids in lecithin. In triglyceride, the <b>percentage</b> of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> was increased and that of linoleic acid decreased. The most remarkable change was noticed in the cholesterolester fraction in which {{almost all of the}} major components were altered by the levels of the dietary protein. These observations clearly indicated that the concentration and composition of each hepatic lipid component were specifically altered by the differences in the levels of dietary casein. Additionally, the dietary protein levels appeared to directly influence not only on the desaturation of linoleate to arachidonate but also on the pool size of these essential fatty acids. It is suggested that these alteration induced by differences in the dietary protein levels may influence the concentration of other fatty acids in the hepatic lipid components. ラット肝臓の脂質成分に及ぼす飼料中のカゼイン量（ 8 ％, 20 ％, 32 ％）の影響について検討した. 1 ） 8 ％カゼイン食で,リン脂質量は著しく低下した. 2 ）各脂質成分の脂肪酸組成の変化はカゼインレベルの増減にともなってほぼ一定の傾向を示したが. 20 ％カゼイン食と 32 ％カゼイン食の間では著しい差異はなかった. レシチンでは 32 ％カゼイン食と 8 ％カゼイン食を比較した場合,高タンパク食でパルミチン酸,パルミトオレイン酸の割合が減少しアラキドン酸が増加した. トリグリセリドでは高カゼイン食でオレイン酸の割合が減少し,リノール酸が増加した. コレステロールエステルでは変化が最も著しく,ほとんどの主要成分で増減があった. 3 ）以上のように飼料中のカゼインレベルによって各脂質成分の脂肪酸組成はそれぞれ特異的に変化した. さらに肝臓におけるリノール酸のアラキドン酸への不飽和化反応やそれらのプールサイズに食餌タンパク質のレベルが直接関係していることが示された. これらの変動が肝臓脂質の他の脂肪酸の濃度にも影響することが推察された...|$|R
