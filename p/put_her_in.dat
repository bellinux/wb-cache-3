Although she persuaded many members of her audiences, she faced significant opposition, which <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> danger. At one meeting pimps threw cow dung at her; at another, the windows of her hotel were smashed, while at a third, threats were made to burn down the building where she was hosting a meeting.|$|E

After catching and brutally beating the figure, Tapp realizes {{that it is}} actually Melissa Sing, a victim whom Tapp had saved earlier in the game. A tape found on Melissa explains that Jigsaw had <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> charge of keeping Tapp alive and making sure he followed the rules of Jigsaw's game after Tapp rescued her. Jigsaw had kidnapped her son and had Pighead sew her mouth shut to avoid her spoiling Tapp's test. Attempting {{to run away from}} Tapp, Melissa desperately charges through a nearby door rigged with a shotgun, which kills her {{in the same way as}} her late husband, Steven Sing.

Valiente and Gardner wrote several letters back-and-forth, with the latter {{eventually}} suggesting that she meet him at the home of his friend and fellow Wiccan Edith Woodford-Grimes ("Dafo"), who lived not far from Bournemouth, in the Christchurch area. Before she left the meeting, Gardner gave her a copy of his 1949 novel, High Magic's Aid, in which he describes a fictionalised account of Wiccan initiates in the Middle Ages; he allegedly did so in order to gauge her opinion on ritual nudity and scourging, both of which were present in his tradition of Gardnerian Wicca.|$|E
5|$|The {{costs of}} keeping the women imprisoned in the tolbooth at Pittenweem were {{becoming}} prohibitive; on 12 August, after payment of five hundred marks, all the women except Cornfoot were released on bail. In September Morton was summoned to give evidence to the Privy Council but he had fully regained his health and displayed no symptoms of being possessed. Adam was questioned by the Privy Council in October and freed. In November, Laing, Lawson, Horsefoot and Wallace were released after paying a fine of £8 each; but {{the last of the}} accused, Cornfoot, was kept in solitary confinement in the tolbooth by Cowper. One of the prison guards, who perhaps felt sorry for her, <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> a cell with a window low enough for her to escape so she also gained her freedom.|$|E
5|$|The outpost is {{evacuated}} {{during the}} dangerous mission, {{leaving only the}} Enterprise away team on surface. The firestorms overwhelm the position that Daren's team occupies {{before they can be}} retrieved. Believing Daren to be dead, Picard sits contemplating his decision in his quarters. He then hears that survivors are being transported aboard, and heads to the transporter room. Daren is not among the initial group of survivors, but is later transported to the ship. Eight members of the team have died. Afterwards, Picard and Daren discuss their relationship. They conclude that it cannot continue, as Picard could not bear to <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> danger once more. They discuss giving up their Starfleet careers to be together. Daren realizes that Picard, still cherishing the family life he experienced as Kamin, has nonetheless chosen duty, career, and loneliness. They both know that Daren must transfer off the Enterprise.

SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero, who portrays an {{on-screen}} authority figure for the SmackDown brand, then came to the ring and proceeded to insult the Big Show, and demanded that he leave the ring. Druids then came to the ring bringing a casket, and The Undertaker appeared on the TitanTron, telling Guerrero to either get in the casket herself or he would <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> it. Guerrero refused to enter the casket voluntarily, so The Undertaker began to come to ringside. The Big Show held back Guerrero as The Undertaker came to the ring. Once he was in the ring, The Undertaker began to choke Guerrero, but the Big Show turned heel, becoming a villainous character, by striking The Undertaker and freeing Guerrero. He proceeded to attack The Undertaker, and restrained him to allow Guerrero to slap him and spit in his face.|$|E

In June 1944, Franklin requested of his daughter Anna, who was then managing some White House social functions and acting as hostess, that she help him arrange to meet Lucy without Eleanor's knowledge. Aware of Rutherfurd's role in her parents' early marriage, Anna was at first angry that her father had <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> such a difficult position. However, she ultimately relented and set up a meeting in Georgetown. To her surprise, Anna found that she liked Lucy immediately, and the pair became friends. There were supposedly several dinners in the White House's second floor private quarters during Roosevelt's last year which were attended by Rutherfurd in a group with Anna's presence and obvious acceptance. When Eleanor discovered shortly after FDR's death from the female cousins of Anna's role in arranging for these meetings, the relationship between Eleanor and Anna became strained and cool for some time.|$|E
