40|$|The genetic {{consequences}} and gene flow of pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) stocking were assessed in three boreal lakes based on admixture model analysis and {{comparison of the}} pre- and post-release patterns of genetic variability at 9 DNA microsatellite loci in the recipient populations. In two out of the three cases, the releases of fish from foreign populations caused {{significant changes in the}} genetic structure of the recipient population. The largest changes were observed in Lake Oulujrvi, where the post-release sample was almost identical to the released Lake Vanajanselk population, and about 90 % of the catch was composed of the released population. The genetic composition of Lake Lohjanjrvi pikeperch also shifted markedly towards that of the released Lake Vanajanselk population, and about half of the later catch was of released Vanajanselk origin. In Lake Vanajanselk, in contrast, releases of pikeperch from lakes Painio and Averia had only a small impact on the genetic structure of the pikeperch population. These results indicate that the current stocking practices create an effective artificial gene flow that may strongly shape and reduce the genetic differentiation among the remaining native pikeperch populations. A common feature of all three cases was the lack of <b>prior</b> <b>appraisal</b> of the potential genetic and ecological risks in relation to the expected benefits of the release programmes...|$|E
40|$|Failures of {{self-control}} {{are thought to}} underlie various important behaviors (e. g., addiction, violence, obesity, poor academic achievement). The modern conceptualization {{of self-control}} failure has been heavily influenced {{by the idea that}} self-control functions as if it relied upon a limited physiological or cognitive resource. This view of self-control has inspired hundreds of experiments designed to test the prediction that acts of self-control are more likely to fail when they follow previous acts of self-control (the depletion effect). Here, we evaluated the empirical evidence for this effect with a series of focused, meta-analytic tests that address the limitations in <b>prior</b> <b>appraisals</b> of the evidence. We find very little evidence that the depletion effect is a real phenomenon, at least when assessed with the methods most frequently used in the laboratory. Our results strongly challenge the idea that self-control functions as if it relies on a limited psychological or physical resource...|$|R
40|$|Following a hedonic framework, {{this paper}} {{constructs}} various transaction-based commercial property price indicators for the Netherlands. Using quarterly {{data from the}} Investment Property Databank (IPD), the analysis covers a total of 10, 000 listed properties over the period 2001 - 2011. The study contributes to the empirical literature by introducing a spatial econometric methodology into a hedonic framework, via a spatially lagged explanatory variable (spatially lagged valuations per square metre). The results provide significant evidence {{of the presence of}} spatial dependence in unit valuations in all sub-sectors of the commercial property market, namely retail, office, industrial and residential. Accordingly, high (low) priced commercial properties tend to be geographically clustered rather than randomly distributed over space. The comparison of the alternative transaction-based indices shows a systematic upward bias in the baseline transaction-based indicator that relies solely on <b>prior</b> <b>appraisals.</b> In addition, compared to the baseline indicator, the spatially augmented transaction-based price indicator appears to fluctuate less and is more robust to small sample sizes.

40|$|Many stream {{restoration}} projects {{continue to}} be implemented without <b>prior</b> watershed-wide <b>appraisals</b> of stream and catchment conditions. This is often {{not the best way}} to allocate scarce funding resources for long-term benefits and may also encourage project failures. It is generally advantageous to first understand the most critical issues in a watershed before pursuing individual projects. This catchment-scale view has been promoted by the Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) in various regions of the state as a means of encouraging the completion of watershed and channel appraisals before initiating restoration design and construction. The fact that most restoration projects will {{continue to be}} conducted in a piecemeal fashion only underscores the need for a good understanding of watershed conditions potentially influencing restoration efforts. Assessments typically delineate individual stream reaches by stream type and rate these according to degree of impairment. However, this has little value in such dynamic environments unless channel segments are subsequently prioritized for repairs. This allows both the most serious problems to be tackled first and high-quality stream corridors at risk to be identified for possible preservation. Needed restoration efforts for improved stream function will rarely be confined to the stream channel network, and repairs in upland areas may be of higher priority than work along the channel. Useful assessments should also provide reasonably detailed and realistic prescriptions for repairing identified problems in the prioritized channel segments...|$|R

Aims This article describes the facilitation over many years by a WHO Collaborating Centre, of sustainable mental health developments in Zanzibar, {{one of the poorest}} countries in the world, using systematic approaches to policy design and implementation. Methods Based on intensive <b>prior</b> situation <b>appraisal</b> and consultation, a multi-faceted set of interventions combining situation appraisal to inform planning; sustained policy dialogue at Union and state levels; development of policy and legislation, development of strategic action plans, establishment of intersectoral national mental health implementation committee, establishment of national mental health coordination system, integration of mental health into primary care, strengthening of primary-secondary care liaison, rationalisation and strengthening of secondary care system, ensuring adequate supply of medicines, use of good practice guidelines and health information systems, development of services for people with intellectual disability, establishment of formal mechanism for close liaison between the mental health services and other governmental, non-governmental and traditional sectors, mental health promotion, suicide prevention, and research and development. Results The policy and legislation introduced in 1999 have resulted in enhanced mental health activities over the ensuing decade, within a setting of extreme low resource. However, advances ebb and flow and continued efforts are required to maintain progress and continue mental health developments. Lessons learnt have informed the development of mental health policies in neighbouring countries. Conclusions A multi-faceted and comprehensive programme can be effective in achieving considerable strengthening of mental health programmes and services even in extremely low resource settings, but requires sustained input and advocacy if gains are to be maintained and enhanced. </p...|$|R
40|$|Investment in {{advanced}} manufacturing technologies (AMT) remains a promising but potentially risky venture. Many firms that have adopted these new technologies {{have not been}} able to reap all the expected benefits. Since the technical abilities of the AMTs are relatively well-proven, there is a growing belief that managerial issues, from planning to implementation, present the major barrier to employing these technologies effectively. This article concentrates on the planning requirements for successful implementation of AMT. We first distil current thoughts from diverse disciplines to provide a better understanding of the AMT adoption process. We then incorporate these thoughts with our empirical research findings to propose an integrated planning (IPL) model for the acquisition of advanced manufacturing technology. This three-phase model incorporates the requirements for strategic planning, the matching of products with process, technology monitoring, integrated operational and organizational planning and formal investment <b>appraisal</b> <b>prior</b> to AMT acquisition. The IPL model provides a framework for managers to (1) continuously assess the ability of their current systems to meet strategic and operational objectives and (2) determine when the adoption of an innovative technology is warranted. technology management planning justification implementation manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of the Quarries Regulations 1999, within the United Kingdom, has emphasised {{the need for a}} preliminary hazard <b>appraisal,</b> <b>prior</b> to undertaking a more detailed geotechnical assessment of slopes considered to represent a significant hazard. Hazard appraisal should differentiate between slopes requiring further investigation and those that do not pose a significant hazard. Both slope geometry (height and angle related to rock quality) and whether or not any potential instability may result in harm to persons or property are used to define what is meant by significant hazard. Data obtained from several surveying techniques, including GPS, remote laser profiling and a total station using a fixed target system, is being used for monitoring and preliminary hazard appraisal of excavated china clay slopes. Topographic data, measured using a GPS surveying system, has been used to create digital terrain models of clay pits operated by IMERYS Minerals Limited, St Austell, United Kingdom.

40|$|Increased {{pornography}} use {{has been}} a feature of contemporary human society, with technological advances allowing for high speed internet and relative ease of access via a multitude of wireless devices. Does increased pornography exposure alter general emotion processing? Research {{in the area of}} pornography use is heavily reliant on conscious self-report measures. However, increasing knowledge indicates that attitudes and emotions are extensively processed on a non-conscious level <b>prior</b> to conscious <b>appraisal.</b> Hence, this exploratory study aimed to investigate whether frequency of pornography use has an impact on non-conscious and/or conscious emotion processes. Participants (N = 52) who reported viewing various amounts of pornography were presented with emotion inducing images. Brain Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) were recorded and Startle Reflex Modulation (SRM) was applied to determine non-conscious emotion processes. Explicit valence and arousal ratings for each image presented were also taken to determine conscious emotion effects. Conscious explicit ratings revealed significant differences with respect to “Erotic” and “Pleasant” valence (pleasantness) ratings depending on pornography use. SRM showed effects approaching significance and ERPs showed changes in frontal and parietal regions of the brain in relation to “Unpleasant” and “Violent” emotion picture categories, which did not correlate with differences seen in the explicit ratings. Findings suggest that increased pornography use appears to have an influence on the brain’s non-conscious responses to emotion-inducing stimuli which was not shown by explicit self-report...|$|R
40|$|Background: Canada’s diverse {{society and}} its {{statutory}} commitment to multiculturalism means that a synthesis of knowledge related to the healthcare experiences of immigrants is essential to realise the health potential for future Canadians. Although concerns about the maternity experiences of immigrants in Canada are relatively new, recent national guidelines explicitly call for the tailoring of services to user needs. We therefore assessed the experiences of immigrant women accessing maternity-care services in Canada. In particular, we investigated the experiences of immigrant women in Canada in accessing and navigating maternity and related healthcare services from conception to 6 months postpartum in Canada. Our focus was on (a) the accessibility and acceptability of maternity-care services for immigrant women and (b) {{the effects of the}} perceptions and experiences of these women on their birth and postnatal outcomes. Methods: We conducted a systematic review using a systematic search and narrative synthesis of peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed reports of empirical research, with the aim of providing stakeholders with perspectives on maternity-care services as experienced by immigrant women. We partnered with key stakeholders (‘integrated knowledge users’) to ensure the relevancy of topics and to tailor recommendations for effective translation into future policy, practice and programming. Two search phases and a three-stage selection process for published and grey literature were conducted <b>prior</b> to <b>appraisal</b> of literature quality and narrative synthesis of the findings. Results: Our knowledge synthesis of maternity care among immigrants to Canada provided a coherent evidence base for (a) eliciting {{a better understanding of the}} factors that generate disparities in accessibility, acceptability and outcomes during maternity care; and (b) improving culturally based competency in maternity care. Our synthesis also identified pertinent issues in multiple sectors that should be addressed to configure maternity services and programs appropriately. Conclusions: Although immigrant women in Canada are generally given the opportunity to obtain necessary services, they face many barriers in accessing and utilising these services. These barriers include lack of information about or awareness of the services, insufficient supports to access these services and discordant expectations between the women and their service providers.

40|$|The {{research}} made in {{the current}} master thesis uses theoretical framework from the area of project management, voluntary labor turnover and performance <b>appraisal.</b> <b>Prior</b> research based on existing literary sources allows assuming that the following factors, such as job alternatives, knowledge intensity and nature of work have specific relevance {{for the emergence of}} voluntary labor turnover in project-based organizations. Employees of the case study company-AGR Field Operations´ Maintenance Engineering department were interviewed and surveyed {{in order to determine the}} relevance of those factors on the example of a concrete project-based organization. The obtained results indicate that the nature of work is more significantly related to the emergence of the voluntary labor turnover in the given case study department. Whereas availability of more job alternatives due to being close to the client or knowledge intensity factor of becoming more generalist do not have the same influence. During the course of the research it was discovered that the department uses outcome-based type of performance appraisal which is proved to be unsuitable in the given organizational settings. To that matter there were provided further suggestions in the field of performance appraisal. The current research will attempt to identify specific factors contributing to the emergence of the voluntary labor turnover specifically for project-based organizations. As well as it will attempt to give suggestions for improvement of the concrete case study department´s performance appraisal tools and thus supplement turnover reduction actions already put in place by the department management. ...|$|R

Data were collected from Poba upazila under Rajshahi district and Gabtoli upazila under Bogra district in Bangladesh from 125 randomly selected rural men out of total population of 1, 145 from 15 February to 14 May, 2009. The fifty potential indigenous knowledge systems were identified through participatory rural <b>appraisal</b> <b>prior</b> to finalizing the schedule.

40|$|There {{is little}} {{empirical}} evidence relating to how university administrative employees view the performance appraisal process (Analoui & Fell, 2002). The {{aim of this}} paper was to investigate administrative staff perceptions and understanding of the appraisal system using AUT University (AUT) as a case study. Areas investigated included (1) how administrative staff viewed the process, (2) did it impact on their motivation, and (3) did it help or hinder career development. The research for this paper was a partial replication of the Analoui and Fell study of appraisal systems at The University of Bradford (UK). The Analoui and Fell questionnaire and interview guide were modified to suit the AUT context. The AUT sample consisted of 543 staff members with a response rate of 20 per cent. It was found that {{there was no evidence that}} the respondents wanted the process discontinued even though comments from those who had been through a Performance and Development Review (P&DR) and Formative Appraisal (FA) indicated a range of positive and negative experiences. In terms of performance appraisal as a motivational tool, few respondents felt that the process motivated them. There was evidence that FA was beneficial in helping with career development. The stated main purposes of AUT performance appraisal is: to assist in administration (pay increase and promotion), and developmental (training) decisions, with the latter purpose being secondary. Resulting from this study recommendations are (1) the current process should be evaluated, and (2) appraisers and appraisees should undertake training <b>prior</b> to an <b>appraisal.</b> On-going research should be undertaken to find out how administrative staff in the wider NZ university sector view the process.

40|$|Background Negative {{attitudes towards}} insulin are {{commonly}} reported {{by people with}} type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) and {{can act as a}} barrier to timely insulin initiation. The Insulin Treatment Appraisal Scale (ITAS) is a widely used 20 -item measure of attitudes towards insulin. While designed for completion by both insulin using and non-insulin using adults with T 2 DM, its psychometric properties have not been investigated separately for these groups. Furthermore, the total score is routinely reported in preference to the published two-factor structure (negative/positive appraisals). Further psychometric validation of the ITAS is required to examine its properties. Methods The ITAS was completed by a subgroup of 748 Diabetes MILES – Australia study participants with T 2 DM, who were either insulin using (n[*]=[*] 249; 45 % women; mean age[*]=[*] 58 [*]±[*] 9 years; mean diabetes duration[*]=[*] 13, SD[*]=[*] 8 years) or non-insulin using (n[*]=[*] 499; 47 % women; mean age 57 [*]±[*] 9 years; mean diabetes duration 7 [*]±[*] 6 years). We replicated the psychometric analyses reported in the ITAS development paper. In addition, we explored factor structure and investigated internal consistency separately for the insulin using and non-insulin using samples. Results Factor analyses supported a two-factor structure with good internal consistency (negative subscale α[*]=[*]. 90; positive subscale α[*]=[*]. 69). Scale performance differed slightly in the insulin using and non-insulin using samples, with some items loading inconsistently between groups. A one-factor solution was not supported in either sample, with the positive items and some negative items failing to load adequately. Consistent with <b>prior</b> research, negative <b>appraisals</b> were significantly more common among non-insulin using participants compared to those using insulin (d[*]=[*] 1. 04), while the positive subscale score did not discriminate between groups. Conclusions The data supported a two factor structure and the positive subscale did not discriminate between insulin using and non-insulin using participants. As such, we recommend use of the negative subscale score in preference to the ITAS total score, and suggest close attention is paid to the relevance of the positive items in the given population.

40|$|Le but de cet article est d'étudier la {{relation}} qui existe entre l’évaluation qu'un subalterne fait de son propre rendement et les évaluations qu'il reçoit de son supérieur et de ses collègues. Suite à une revue de la littérature, l'auteur présente et explique les résultats d'une recherche effectuée récemment auprès de 215 cadres d'une entreprise canadienneThe {{purpose of}} this article is to study the relationship between an employee's own evaluation and the ratings he receives from his superior and his colleagues. Following a review of the literature, the author presents the results of a study conducted recently in a canadian firm. More precisely, this article attempts to provide answers to the following four questions : (a) does the evaluation which the subordinate makes of his own performance agree with the evaluation made by his superior? (b) if there is little or no agreement, which evaluation is more favorable to the employee? (c) does the evaluation made by the employee's peers agree with his own and/or with that of his superior? (d) if there is little or no agreement, are the peers more or less severe than the superior and/or the employee himself ?A review of eight studies which have compared self with superiors' evaluations indicates clearly that the two sets of ratings seldom correlate very well. Moreover, there are good reasons to believe that the subordinates generally tend to evaluate themselves more favorably than their superiors do. As far as peers are concerned, several studies suggest that their perceptions of the employees' performance correlate relatively well with those of the employees' superiors. There is very little research, however, concerning the relationship between peers' and self evaluations. There is also a serious lack of information concerning the favorableness of peers' ratings as compared with self and superiors' ratings. The study reported here was done with 215 managers in a manufacturing firm whose main operations are located in Québec and Ontario. Self evaluations on six factors were collected on a questionnaire. The respondents were then evaluated by their immediate superior and by an average of 3. 2 peers. The results of this study can be summarized as follows: (a) there is little or no correlation between self and superiors' evaluations ; (b) subordinates evaluate themselves more favorably then their superiors do, on all six factors; (c) peers' evaluations correlate relatively well with superiors' evaluations, but do not correlate at all with the evaluations done by the subordinates themselves; (d) as far as favorableness is concerned, there are indications that peers' evaluations are located half-way between superiors' and subordinates' evaluations. Several explanations are suggested for these and similar results obtained else-where: lack of agreement on what the subordinate's job really is and what qualities itrequires ; stereotyped role-playing by both the superiors and the subordinates ; establishment of a « bargaining position » by both actors <b>prior</b> to the <b>appraisal</b> interview A major source of disagreement could also be found in the way superiors, peers, and subordinates select the norms against which they evaluate performance, and this is discussed at some length. As indicated in the conclusion, these results suggest that a « Management by Objectives » type of appraisal may be more necessary than some managers are inclined to think...|$|R
