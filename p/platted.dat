5|$|Arlington was {{established}} in the 1880s by settlers and the area was <b>platted</b> as two towns, Arlington and Haller City. Haller City was absorbed by the larger Arlington, which was incorporated as a city in 1903. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Arlington area became home to projects under the direction of federal relief agencies, including a municipal airport that would serve as a naval air station during World War II. Beginning in the 1980s, Arlington experienced the effects of suburbanization, growing by over 450 percent by 2000 and annexing the unincorporated area of Smokey Point to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|In November 1883, the Oregon and California Railroad {{was built}} {{through the center}} of the Rogue Valley, {{bypassing}} Jacksonville, the county seat. The railroad company also constructed a train depot halfway between Central Point and Phoenix, and <b>platted</b> 82 city blocks around it. The townsite was named Medford in December. In 1884, residents celebrated the town's first Independence Day by firing 38 cannon blasts—one for each U.S. state—from Roxy Ann Peak's summit. Medford grew quickly, and was incorporated on February 24, 1885.|$|E
5|$|Riverside and Avondale were {{developed}} out of former plantation land. Most {{of this area}} was part of two plantations: Dell's Bluff, granted by the Spanish Florida government in 1801, and a tract eventually known as Magnolia Plantation, granted in 1815. Both changed hands several times before the American Civil War. In 1868, Dell's Bluff's then owner, Miles Price, sold off {{the southern part of}} the plantation to Florida Union editor Edward M. Cheney and Boston developer John Murray Forbes, who <b>platted</b> the original Riverside development. The northern part Price developed himself as Jacksonville's Brooklyn neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Riverside {{was first}} <b>platted</b> in 1868 and was annexed by Jacksonville in 1887. Its {{greatest}} growth occurred between the Great Fire of 1901 {{and the failure}} of the 1920s Florida land boom; this period included the creation of the original Avondale development in 1920. Today, Riverside and Avondale are notable for their particularly diverse architecture and their emphasis on planning and historic preservation, which have made them Florida's most architecturally varied neighborhood. Both neighborhoods are listed as National Register Historic Districts.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{opened in}} 1921 and spurred {{a new wave}} of {{development}} in South Jacksonville. New subdivisions were <b>platted</b> in Oklahoma and Villa Alexandria, including South Shores, Alexandria Place, River Oaks, and the original San Marco development, while the old Red Bank plantation became South Riverside and Colonial Manor. The 1857 the Red Bank Plantation House became a residence in the Colonial Manor neighborhood that grew around it; it is Jacksonville's second oldest residential building still in use. The bridge triggered economic development in South Jacksonville as well, though it greatly reduced the ferry business, which disappeared entirely within twenty years.|$|E
5|$|Varadharaja Perumal Temple, {{dedicated}} to Vishnu and covering , {{is the largest}} Vishnu temple in Kanchipuram. It was built by the Cholas in 1053 and was expanded during the reigns of Kulottunga Chola I (1079–1120) and Vikrama Chola (1118–1135). It {{is one of the}} divyadesams, the 108 holy abodes of Vishnu. The temple features carved lizards, one <b>platted</b> with gold and another with silver, over the sanctum.Clive of India is said to have presented an emerald necklace to the temple. It is called the Clive Makarakandi and is still used to decorate the deity on ceremonial occasions.|$|E
5|$|Located on {{the western}} banks of the north-flowing Red River of the North, in a flat region known as the Red River Valley, the city is prone to flooding. The Red River Flood of 1997 devastated the city. Originally called Les Grandes Fourches by French fur traders from Canada, who had long worked and lived in the region, {{steamboat}} captain Alexander Griggs <b>platted</b> a community after being forced to winter there. The Grand Forks post office was established in 1870; and the town was incorporated on February 22, 1881. The city was named for its location at the fork of the Red River and the Red Lake River.|$|E
5|$|Marquette's {{founding}} settlers {{arrived in}} the area on May 18, 1849, to establish the community, and the original thoroughfares were <b>platted</b> by 1855, including Washington and Front streets. The widest street in the city at , Baraga Avenue {{was intended to be}} the Marquette's main street when the downtown area was originally laid out, but businesses centered their locations along Washington Street instead. The community was incorporated as a village in 1859, and it was later reincorporated as a city on February 21, 1871. The original city hall was built in 1895 on Washington Street, and in 1910, the city started paving its streets, replacing wooden planks with asphalt.|$|E
5|$|Marysville was {{formally}} <b>platted</b> on February 25, 1885, {{filed by the}} town physician J. D. Morris and dedicated by the Comefords. More settlers began to arrive {{after the completion of}} the town's first sawmill in 1887, joined by three others {{by the end of the}} decade. Marysville was officially incorporated as a fourth-class city on March 20, 1891, with a population of approximately 400 residents and Mark Swinnerton serving as the city's first mayor. The Great Northern Railway also completed construction of its tracks through Marysville in 1891, building a drawbridge over Ebey Slough and serving the city's sawmills. A newspaper named the Marysville Globe was established by Thomas P. Hopp in 1892 and continues to be published for the city.|$|E
5|$|Migratory {{groups of}} Native Americans {{inhabited}} {{the area for}} thousands of years, but the first permanent settlements in what would become Harrison County were created by American settlers {{in the years after}} the American Revolutionary War. The population grew rapidly during first decade of the 19thcentury. Corydon was officially <b>platted</b> in 1808 and became the capital of the Indiana Territory in 1813. Many of the state's early important historic events occurred in the county, including the writing of Indiana's first constitution. Corydon was the state capital until 1825, but in the years afterward remained an important hub for southern Indiana. In 1859 there was a major meteorite strike. In 1863 the Battle of Corydon was fought, the only battle of the American Civil War to occur in Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Portland was <b>platted</b> in 1845, then Daniel H. Lownsdale {{purchased}} land {{south and}} west of the original platting. He drew up a plat in 1848 that included 11 narrow blocks, 100×200 feet, instead of the standard 200×200 feet. He then brought on Stephen Coffin and William W. Chapman as partners, and dedicated the South Park Blocks and midtown park blocks in 1852. This made them the first official greenspace in Portland. While they were dedicated to the city, they weren't owned by the city until September 22, 1870, when Mayor Bernard Goldsmith and Chapman agreed on selling the South Park Blocks and the two Plaza Blocks (Chapman and Lownsdale Squares) to the city for $6,250. Most {{of the purchase price}} was for the Plaza Blocks, since the park blocks were {{at the edge of the}} developed city.|$|E
5|$|The town of Harrisburg was <b>platted</b> a {{few miles}} south of the {{junction}} of the Goshen and Shawneetown–Kaskaskia Trail, two of the first pioneer trade routes in the state. Prior to the War of 1812, most of the population of today's Saline County lived in cabins clustered around blockhouses to protect against Indian attack and dangerous wildlife such as wild cats and bears. Permanent settlements in the forested area were inevitable with the influx of more settlers, and the first land entry was made in 1814 by John Wren and Hankerson Rude. By 1840 the settlers outnumbered the Native Americans, and most of the black bear population of the county had been killed off by 1845.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the initial silver rush, a town site was <b>platted</b> {{and the town}} was built. The first permanent business building established in Silver Reef was a store {{at the intersection of}} the roads from the Buckeye, White, and East reefs. By 1878, the town's business district consisted of a hotel, boarding houses, nine stores, six saloons, five restaurants, a bank, two dance halls, a newspaper called The Silver Echo (which later became the Silver Reef Miner), and eight dry goods stores. Two cemeteries, one Catholic and one Protestant, were located south of Silver Reef's business district. Most of the businesses in Silver Reef were situated along a mile-long Main Street. The mining district consisted of 37 mines and five stamp mills: the Christy, Stormont, Leeds, Buckeye and Barbee & Walker mills. Although it was surrounded by settlements with large Mormon populations, the town never had a Mormon meeting house. A Catholic church was the only church located within the town. After the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, many of the Chinese workers who had been hired to build it were out of work. Some returned to China, but others remained in Utah. A group of 250 of these workers set up a Chinatown in a level area just south of Silver Reef. Silver Reef's Chinatown had a Chinese mayor and several businesses. By 1879, Silver Reef's population had reached 2,000, and the town also had a horse race track, a brewery, and a brass band. Shooting matches among members of the Silver Reef Rifle Club and sometimes residents of nearby towns took place on the horse race track.|$|E

25|$|Interest {{in the new}} {{subdivision}} was immediate, and in 1917, the Rosedale Park Land Development Company <b>platted</b> {{an addition}} to the original area. However, the actual construction in the neighborhood was slow—from 1917 {{until the end of}} World War I, only 15 houses had been constructed. However, construction soon blossomed, and in 1921 a third addition was <b>platted.</b> The city of Detroit annexed the subdivision in 1926, bringing water and sewer to the neighborhood and making the area more attractive.|$|E
25|$|Becker was <b>platted</b> in 1867, {{and named}} for George Loomis Becker, a state legislator. A post office called Becker {{has been in}} {{operation}} since 1870.|$|E
25|$|From {{the middle}} of the 19th century until the 1920s, the area that is now the University-Cultural Center was {{characterized}} by upper-class single-family homes. After the Civil War, the city of Detroit <b>platted</b> and sold lots along Woodward to private developers. Houses first appeared along Woodward in the 1860s, and construction in the area reached a peak in the 1880s and 1890s as developments off Woodward, first to the east and then to the west, were <b>platted.</b> Construction east of Second Avenue did not reach full swing until the early 1900s.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, Ben Porter sold {{a portion}} of his {{property}} near the base of Santa Susana Pass to the Porter Land and Water Company, which <b>platted</b> it as the community of Chatsworth Park.|$|E
25|$|The land {{on which}} Rosedale Park sits was {{originally}} deeded in 1835 to Otis C. Freeman and George Bellamy as two 80-acre (32 ha) parcels. Over time, these parcels were subdivided until in 1916 the Rosedale Park Land Development Company purchased and <b>platted</b> {{a large portion of}} what was to become the Rosedale Park Historic District. This development company <b>platted</b> other projects in addition to Rosedale Park, most notably the North Rosedale Park neighborhood directly across Grand River Avenue. The company considered the location amenable to development because of its proximity to Grand River Avenue, a direct link to downtown Detroit, and the contemporaneous construction of Outer Drive.|$|E
25|$|The Cañon City (Colorado) Claim Club first <b>platted</b> {{the town}} of Cañon City in 1860. The Club had six members, each of whom mined coal, iron, gypsum, marble and granite mining in the area, and Denver also had a claim club.|$|E
