40|$|The {{analysis}} of {{the response of the}} statically undetermined truss girder in the process of the proportional loading is presented in this paper. Rigidity of the six-bar girder is selected by the draw of the <b>profile</b> <b>bars</b> among the assumed collection of the steel hot-rolled tubes. Two stadiums of exertion of the girder-elastic and non-elastic ones are considered. Each of these stadiums ends by plastification of the one of the tensile bars or buckling of the one of the bars in compression. Assuming some approximate assumptions, the possibilities are indicated for creating the statically determined three-bar structure and a passive part of the girder in the non-elastic stadium. Both the structure and the passive part can have two different forms depending on the drawn <b>profiles</b> of the <b>bars.</b> Each form of the structures has its own path of exertion to achieve the state of limit capacity. It depends which the active bar of the structure experiences plastification in stretching or buckling in compression.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{longshore}} sediment transport {{for a variety}} of bathymetric and wave conditions using the National Oceanic Partnership Program (NOPP) NearCoM Model. The model is used {{to determine the effects of}} wave shape and bathymetry changes on the resulting longshore sediment transport. The wave drivers, REF/DIF 1 and REF/DIF S, are used to assess the effects of monochromatic and spectral waves on longshore sediment transport, respectively. SHORECIRC is used as the circulation module and four different sediment transport models are used. Longshore transport comparisons are made with and without skewed orbital velocities in the shear stress and current velocities. It is found that the addition of skewed orbital velocities in shear stress and transport formulations increases longshore sediment transport by increasing time-varying effective shear stress. The addition of skewed orbital velocities greatly increases the transport due to advection by waves. The localized longshore sediment transport is calculated using a generic physics based method and formulas by Bagnold, Bailard, and Bowen, Watanabe, and Ribberink. The transport results for each scenario are compared to the total transport CERC, Kamphuis, and GENESIS formulas. The bathymetries tested include an equilibrium beach profile, cusped beach <b>profiles,</b> and <b>barred</b> beach <b>profiles</b> with different <b>bar</b> locations. The longshore transport on an equilibrium beach profile is modeled for a 0. 2 mm and 0. 4 mm grain size and transport is compared to the CERC formula. The longshore sediment transport for d= 0. 2 mm is larger than d= 0. 4 mm when wave power is small, but as wave power increases the transport for the larger grain size dominates. The transport is also affected by the addition of cusps and bars on an equilibrium beach <b>profile.</b> The <b>barred</b> beach is modified to compare transport between waves breaking at the bar, before the bar, and after the bar. The features affect the transport when the wave powers are small, but as wave heights increase the cusp and bar features induce little change on the longshore sediment transport. M. S.

The measured bathymetry was alongshore averaged and modeled by the superposition of two Gaussian-shaped sandbars on an underlying planar slope. A third, half-Gaussian-shaped bar represented steepening at the shoreline. The rms error between the measured bathymetry and the profile model was 0. 10 m (estimated over 322 different surveys). The model explained 99 % of the profile variance that remained after first removing the linear, cross-shore trend from each observed <b>profile.</b> <b>Bar</b> response, which was {{extracted from the}} modeled profiles, was compared to a local hydrodynamic forcing variable Γ (Γ {{was defined as the}} ratio of the wave height to water depth, evaluated at bar crest locations). At low values of Γ (i. e., nonbreaking conditions), bars migrated onshore, and their amplitude tended to decay. At high values of Γ (i. e., breaking conditions), bars migrated offshore, with relatively little change in amplitude. The transition between onshore and offshore migration occurred at a value of Γ that was consistent with the onset of wave breaking. Bar migration was associated with a stabilizing feedback mechanism, which drove bar crests toward an equilibrium position at the wave breakpoint. However, we observed that the rate of bar response showed no reduction for any nonzero choice of Γ, indicating that bars never reached equilibrium. Systematic bar amplitude decay was observed under nonbreaking conditions. Bar amplitude decay could drive Γ farther away from breaking conditions, allowing further bar amplitude decay. This is a destabilizing feedback mechanism, potentially leading to bar destruction...|$|R
