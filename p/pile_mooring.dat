The {{project has been}} done in co-operation with the FDN engineering company and Delft technical university. A design is made of a continuous pontoon floating bridge, which connects a mainland to an island. Floating bridges can be constructed where conventional bridges are impractical (under the conditions that are described in section 1. 4. 2). The buoyancy forces support the bridge in the vertical direction and the mooring system in the horizontal direction. The project contains also a survey of the most known floating bridges in the world. Problem definition Which design limitations and structural parameters can ensure stability of the continuous pontoon floating bridge under wind and wave load? Research The objective of this thesis is to understand the response of the continuous pontoon floating bridges under wind-wave load and traffic load that is described in the euro code which enables us to optimize the structural design procedure. That can be accomplished by studying the influence of the pontoon dimensions and the pontoon connector rotational rigidity on the global stability of the bridge. Determination the principles of response reduction and converting the displacement into internal forces are a relevant part of this thesis as well as the mitigating of the local environmental loads to be redistributed along larger parts of the bridge. The scope of the graduation project is very wide. It contains an overview of floating bridges; its hydrodynamic behaviour will be defined and due to the limited period of time will be not analyzed. The hydrostatic behaviour and analysis of continuous pontoon floating bridges will be researched as a multi-body slender structure with flexible connections. Also the conceptual design of the pontoons and the connections and the shape effects were researched. Detailed design calculations for the case study are included in this thesis. Results Environmental loads are the main loading on the floating bridge. Because of the random form of the sea wave forces and the wind force, it is difficult to expect the precise value and direction of loading on the bridge. The environmental loads twist the bridge and excite it in the horizontal and in the vertical direction. When it is possible to construct a sliding <b>pile</b> <b>mooring</b> system to introduce the wind and wave load in the horizontal direction, the floating bridge will have a satisfactory stability. The efficiency of the mooring cable is lower than the sliding pile due to the relatively large compliance range. That is valid also for the vertical displacement; the bridge response will be introduced by the bridge flexural rigidity, the bridge mass, the water spring, the water damping and the pontoon connector stiffness when discrete pontoons are used. The linear theory is applied to determine the sea wave load. The hydro-static and the hydro-dynamic analysis of a multi-body slender structure consisting of rigidly or flexibly connected elements will be made [...] The design procedure of the mooring cables of the offshore structure is applied to design the mooring system. Conclusions and recommendations The connection stiffness of the pontoon has a large influence on the bridge response. The ratio connection stiffness over pontoon stiffness is very important for the bridge structural behaviour. When this ratio is smaller than 10 - 8 the bridge behaves as rigid bodies connected by hinges. When this ratio is larger than 10 - 3 the bridge behaves as a continuous elastic beam. The largest deflections, moments, and shear forces occur in the ends of the bridge. Additional supports, masses, or dampers at these ends can reduce these moments and forces strongly. Embedment steel crossheads are used to introduce the large mooring line forces without damaging the concrete walls of the pontoons. Further optimization of the pontoon length is recommended. Fatigue of the prestressing steel and the concrete are shown to be critical and need to be further investigated. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the MAST III project PROMISE (Pre-Operational Modelling in the Seas of Europe) a data set was assembled which will serve as a comprehensive bench-mark data set for testing and evaluating coupled numerical models to simulate suspended sediment (SPM) transport in shallow tidal lagoons. The data were sampled in the Sylt-Roemoe bight, a semi-enclosed lagoon in the North-Frisian Wadden Sea at the border between Germany and Denmark. The total sampling periods were from April 1996 to October 1996 and during April 1997. Out of these, four periods (three in 1996 and one in 1997) of three weeks lengths were selected and further processed for the PROMISE project. They include significant wind events with wind speeds above 15 m/s. The observational data encompass SPM measurements and all hydrographical and meteorological parameters significant for the SPM transport. Used devices were <b>moored</b> <b>piles</b> with probe packages, moored Acoustical Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP), a wave rider buoy and a vertical multiprobe profiler plus an ADCP from a cruising vessel.

40|$|Floating Production Storage Offloading vessels (FPSOs) {{are widely}} used in {{offshore}} {{oil and gas industry}} in harsh environments reach at the Grand Banks. Vessels working at an offshore site must be held in position despite the effects of wind, waves, and current. Many FPSOs are keeping position using seafloor anchors which are commonly secured using anchor piles. Anchor piles are very effective in many soils. The pile can either be drilled in and grouted, using an offshore mobile drilling rig, or driven in with an underwater hammer or a follower. The anchor pile resists pullout by a combination of bending plus passive resistance and skin friction shear. [...] Correctly designed pile anchors should transfer the environmental loads on the floating platforms to the seabed safely. In-service, these anchor piles are subjected {{to a wide range of}} monotonic and cyclic lateral to oblique pull forces. The large cyclic forces applied during extreme storm will tend to govern the design. [...] The presented work aims at identifying the behavior and capacity of anchor piles used for anchoring offshore floating structures in dense sand. As full-scale experimental verification is not always possible, this raises up the need to design a physical model which can simulate the behavior of the full-scale case. To simulate the important gravitational component, the physical model tests were conducted using the geotechnical centrifuge to investigate the anchor <b>piles</b> response to <b>mooring</b> forces in saturated dense sand. Two centrifuge tests setup were carried out. In each test setup four model pipe piles were jacked in flight in homogeneous saturated sand and subjected to monotonic and cyclic pull-out forces with inclination angle 0 ° (pure lateral loading), 16 °, 30 °, and 90 ° (pure tension loading) with the horizontal. The soil pile interaction behavior was monitored through the strain gauges attached on the pile. While the undisturbed soil stiffness distribution with depth will be measured using a shear wave measurement system of bender elements which can provide soil shear modulus distribution with depth. [...] To study many factors that are affecting the model, a 3 -D finite element model (FEM) was validated from the experimental centrifuge results. The validated FEM was used to do a parametric study to get design procedures and provide better understanding of the response of anchor piles to a variety of loading conditions. The parameters that will affect the pile behavior as suggested from the previous researchers and will be studied here are pile diameter, pile flexibility, load inclination angle, and padeye depth on the pile. [...] From the present study, it was found that there is a significant interaction between lateral and tension loading. A design method was proposed to predict the ultimate capacity of offshore anchor pile depending on pile flexibility, loading angle and padeye depth. Also, a design method was proposed to predict the maximum bending moment...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{daily life}} of {{inhabitants}} of Hagonoy, the Philippines, {{is affected by}} tidal and fluvial floods. Ground subsidence is {{the main cause of}} a worsening trend of these floods. Excessive uncontrolled groundwater subtraction creates a ground level decrease up to 5 cm per year. In combination with yearly six to nine typhoons raging over the country, this leads to unliveable conditions. In order to contribute to the improvement of living conditions of the inhabitants, a modular amphibious structure is designed to keep buildings above the water level. Part I -Background In order to design a suitable amphibious foundation for Hagonoy, a research is done into modular, circular building concepts. Hereby a desired translation of the Dutch building concept of Finch Buildings into a Filipino concept can be made. In combination with criteria concluded from research into floating behaviour of structures and from an analysis of the location, a number of criteria is listed, on which the design of the floating modules and the connections is based. Part II – Structural design By analysing and rating several floating construction types and connection types, a concept design for a modular prefabricated amphibious foundation is made. Timber frame, filled with recycled 200 L barrels is the basis for a flexible building concept. Three scenarios in which the foundation must give a proper structural performance, are outlined. Due to change in water depth, the structure must be able to function in a dry, a just-floating and a floating position. Since this foundation must be able to carry varying configurations of buildings, multiple load cases can occur. The most unfavourable load cases occur during typhoons, due to high wind pressure and high and long wind generated waves. By creating a parametric visualization and calculation model, a first insight in dimensions, and width and length of the amphibious foundation is determined. This concept design for both foundation modules and connections between modules is elaborated more in detail. A timber structure of 1, 20 m x 2, 40 m holds eight 200 L barrels in place. Due to brackish water, the timber structural elements must be protected against shipworm attack. In a brief research several possible solutions are described, of which wrapping structural elements with coir is determined to function best, according to previously stated criteria. In this design, barrels can be replaced in case of damages. Prefabricated foundation modules can be connected by a combination of a U-shaped bottom connection, and a relative fast fixable upper connection. By this connection a rigid wide body can be built in order to provide stability for all scenarios. Two case-studies, one being a foundation with a single building and the second being a foundation with a configuration of eight buildings, are tested by means of SCIA Engineer. For the foundation with a single building in floating position, deflections are too high due to extreme wind-generated wave loads. By increasing the width and length, deflections decreases. The largest bending moments and shear forces occur when the foundation with a configuration of eight buildings touches the soil on one side, due to a large heeling moment. These occurring bending moments and shear forces form an input for optimization of both the foundation module and the connection. In order to reduce the demand for groundwater, and thereby to contribute to reduce of ground subsidence, a design is made for making use of rainwater, and store it in the foundation. In addition waste water can be cleaned by integrated helophyte filters. Bamboo <b>mooring</b> <b>piles</b> create horizontal stability. By replanting bamboo, poles can be replaced over years. Part III - Conclusions A design for a prefabricated modular amphibious structure that is applicable in and adjusted to a flood and typhoon prone area, such as Hagonoy is delivered. Concluded from theory of floating behaviour and a rough cost estimation, a foundation for a single building is not recommended. In order to start building the pilot version, knowledge of actual behaviour of wind generated waves, optimization in the field of structural behaviour and costs are recommended.
