40|$|The author {{describes}} the larva! features of Habronyx heros Wesmael (Hymenoptera, Ichneu- monidae, Anomaloninae). The five larva! instars were on, {{the first of}} which was caudate and the others worm-like. The morphologicals details of the head were studied: the first instar had strongly schlerotized mandibles and well shaped maxilae and an inferior labrum with sensilla; the second instar was ligthly schlerotized, while the third, fourth and fifth instars showed a pro- gressive thickening of the <b>peristoma,</b> the dorsal half of the head and the inferior labrum. The key for last instar larvae (from Gauld, 1976) was modified according to the hypostomal spur varia- bility ecountered. The !ife cycle and the competition among larvae into the host was observed and outlined...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the geometry of}} (peri) stomas of laryngectomized patients in relation to patch use. This data will enable improvement of tracheostoma interfaces, specifically addressing patients currently unable to use stoma patches. The low use of Heat-and-Moisture-Exchange (HME) filters and (hands-free) speech valves, although {{very important to the}} quality of life of laryngectomized patients, is mainly attributed to poor fit of the adhesive patches to the stoma site. Current patch shapes are not based upon an objective (peri) stoma geometry because this geometry is unknown. Observational anthropometric study of the (peri) stoma of laryngectomized patients. Ten hospitals or institutes in eight countries. About 191 laryngectomized patients, at least 1 year post operative. (Peri) stomas were photographed and measured. Patients completed a questionnaire on patch-use. Concavity of commercially available patches was measured. In countries with a financial reimbursement system 58 % of the patients use patches, compares to only 9 % in other countries. Patches stay in situ for an average of 33. 3 h. Patch and non-patch users differ on five out of ten measured geometrical parameters. Most striking differences are that patch users have much shallower <b>peristomas</b> (13 versus 18 mm), and stomas far more parallel to the anterior neck plane. The deepest commercially available patch is only 7 mm deep. This study provides detailed (peri) stoma geometry data of a divers population, and for the first time in relation to patch-use. It reveals a serious mismatch between patients and patches. With these data new patches can be developed that could dramatically improve rehabilitation after laryngectom...|$|R

40|$|All {{patients}} with {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) with <b>peristoma</b> and stoma disorders who receive immunomodulatory therapy must undergo a detailed clinical, histological and microbiological examination including detailed history for pre-existing skin diseases. A 34 -year old woman with Crohn&# 146;s disease during Infliximab treatment presented with tender verrucous lesions in the perianal area and a small verrucous lesion involving the ileostoma. Perianal lesions were enlarged and had a condylomatous appearance, and had become painful. At the same time, a small grayish-white papillomatous plaque on the upper circumference of the ileostoma, with a sharp outline but with no downward extension into the ileum, was noticed. Light microscopic analysis of the stoma lesion demonstrated only signs of mild chronic inflammation but no definite koilocytosis. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis for HPV was negative. Cryotherapy of perianal lesions was performed successfully while Infliximab infusions were interrupted. The patient was on regular follow-up and was receiving azathioprine and low doses of steroids. In all IBD cases with long-term immunomodulatory drug use, clinical follow-up is mandatory as long term toxicity and carcinogenecity of these new biological agents still remain under investigation.

40|$|The morpho-anatomy of the micro-predator Huttonella bicolor (Hutton, 1838) is {{investigated}} in detail. The species is a micro-predator snail, which is splaying in tropical and subtropical areas {{all over the}} world, the first report being from the Amazon Rainforest region of northern Brazil. The shell is very long, with complex peristome teeth. The radula bears sharp pointed teeth. The head lacks tentacles, bearing only ommatophores. The pallial cavity lacks well-developed vessels (except for pulmonary vessel); the anus and urinary aperture are on pneumostome. The kidney is solid, with ureter totally closed (tubular); the primary ureter is straight, resembling orthurethran fashion. The buccal mass has an elongated and massive odontophore, of which muscles are described; the odontophore cartilages are totally fused with each other. The salivary ducts start as one single duct, bifurcating only prior to insertion. The mid and hindguts are relatively simple and with smooth inner surfaces; there is practically no intestinal loop. The genital system has a zigzag-fashioned fertilization complex, narrow prostate, no bursa copulatrix, short and broad vas deferens, and simple penis with gland at distal tip. The nerve ring bears three ganglionic masses, and an additional pair of ventral ganglia connected to pedal ganglia, interpreted as odontophore ganglia. These features are discussed {{in light of the}} knowledge of other streptaxids and adaptations to carnivory. A morfo-anatomia do micro-predador Huttonella bicollor (Hutton, 1838) é investigada em detalhe. A espécie é um caracol micro-predador que está se espalhando pelas áreas tropicais e subtropicais pelo mundo, sendo este o primeiro registro para a Floresta Amazônica, região Norte do Brasil. A concha é muito longa, com complexos dentes no <b>perístoma.</b> A rádula possui dentes pontiagudos. A cabeça carece de tentáculos, possuindo somente omatóforos. A cavidade palial carece de vasos bem desenvolvidos (exceto a veia pulmonar); o ânus e a abertura urinária estão sobre o pneumóstoma. O rim é maciço, com ureter totalmente fechado (tubular); o ureter primário é reto, lembrando o modelo orturetra. A massa bucal tem um odontóforo alongado e maciço, cujos músculos estão descritos; as cartilagens do odontóforo são totalmente fundidas uma com a outra. Os ductos das glândulas salivares começam como único ducto, bifurcando somente antes da inserção. Os tubos digestivos médio e posterior são relativamente simples e com superfície interna lisa; praticamente não há alça intestinal. O sistema reprodutor possui um complexo de fertilização em zigzag, próstata estreita, ausência de bursa copulatrix, vaso deferente curto e grosso e pênis simples com glândula no topo. O anel nervoso possui três massas ganglionares e um par adicional ventral conectado aos gânglios pediosos, interpretados com gânglios odontofóricos. Estas características são discutidas sob a luz do conhecimento atual sobre outros Streptaxidae e adaptações à carnivoria...|$|E
