5|$|The Philippine–American War was {{an armed}} {{military}} {{conflict between the}} United States and the First Philippine Republic, fought between 1899 and least 1902, which arose from a Filipino political struggle against U.S. occupation of the Philippines. Although the conflict was officially declared over on July 4, 1902, American troops continued hostilities against remnants of the Philippine Army and other resistance groups until 1913, and some historians consider these unofficial extensions <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E

50|$|During <b>the</b> early <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy {{not only}} had lost many capital ships but was facing {{increasing}} pressure to provide escorts to precious convoys in the Atlantic.

5|$|The {{conflict}} escalated into armed {{incidents in}} the majority-Serb populated areas. The Serbs attacked Croatian police units in Pakrac in early March, while one Josip Jović is widely reported as the first police officer killed by Serb forces as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> during the Plitvice Lakes incident in late March 1991.|$|E
5|$|U.S. forces also {{established}} an officer candidate {{school during the}} later <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> using instructors selected from the American troops in the country.

5|$|Against Walpole's wishes, but to George's delight, Britain reopened {{hostilities}} with Spain in 1739. Britain's {{conflict with}} Spain, the War of Jenkins' Ear, became <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> of the Austrian Succession when a major European dispute broke out upon {{the death of}} Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740. At issue was the right of Charles's daughter, Maria Theresa, to succeed to his Austrian dominions. George spent the summers of 1740 and 1741 in Hanover, where he was more able to intervene directly in European diplomatic affairs {{in his capacity as}} elector.|$|E
50|$|Infantry {{underwent}} profound developments during <b>the</b> Italian <b>Wars,</b> evolving from a primarily pike- and halberd-wielding {{force to}} a more flexible arrangement of arquebusiers, pikemen, and other troops.

50|$|Montrose, {{through his}} lieutenant, MacColla, (who {{commanded}} the 2000 Irish troops {{sent by the}} Irish Confederates), {{was able to use}} this conflict to rally Clan Donald against Clan Campbell.

5|$|Although {{provisionally}} {{assigned the}} designation U-7, the submarine was commissioned as SM U-12 on 21 August 1914, with Linienschiffsleutnant Egon Lerch in command. U-12s activities over the early <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> are not reported, but the boat's armament was augmented by a 3.7cm/23 (1.5in) quick-firing (QF) deck gun in November 1914.

5|$|Eagle {{spent the}} first nine months of World War II in the Indian Ocean searching for German {{commerce}} raiders. During the early <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> the Fleet Air Arm was desperately short of fighters and Eagle was equipped solely with Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers until late 1940. She was transferred to the Mediterranean in May 1940, where she escorted convoys to Malta and Greece and attacked Italian shipping, naval units and bases in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ship also participated in the Battle of Calabria in July but her aircraft failed to score any hits when they attempted to torpedo Italian cruisers during the battle. Whenever Eagle was not at sea, her aircraft were disembarked and used ashore.|$|E

5|$|HMS Ledbury was {{an escort}} {{destroyer}} of the Hunt class Type II. The Royal Navy ordered Ledburys construction {{two days after}} the outbreak of the Second World War and J. I. Thornycroft Ltd laid down her keel at their Southampton yard on 24 January 1940. Air raid damage to the yard delayed her construction and she did not launch until 27 September 1941. Her initial assignment was to perform escort duties between Scapa Flow and Iceland. She remained in this theatre for the first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> during which time she served with the ill-fated Arctic convoy PQ 17 in June 1942, from which twenty-four ships were lost.|$|E
5|$|In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush {{referred}} to an {{axis of evil}} including Iraq, Iran and North Korea. After the September 11 attacks on New York, Bush launched the War on Terror, in which the United States military and a small international coalition invaded Afghanistan. In 2003, Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq, searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he described as being <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> on Terrorism. Those invasions led to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan {{and the removal of}} Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{purchasing}} the Star, Harding {{turned his attention}} to politics, supporting Foraker in his first successful bid for governor in 1885. Foraker was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> generation that challenged older Ohio Republicans, such as Senator John Sherman, for control of state politics. Harding, always a party loyalist, supported Foraker in the complex internecine warfare that was Ohio Republican politics. Harding was willing to tolerate Democrats, as necessary to a two-party system, but had only contempt for those who bolted the Republican Party to join third-party movements. He was a delegate to the Republican state convention in 1888, at the age of 22, representing Marion County, and would be elected a delegate in most years until becoming president.|$|E

5|$|The He 111 was {{constantly}} upgraded and modified, but became obsolete {{during the latter}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> The German Bomber B project was not realised, which forced the Luftwaffe to continue operating the He 111 in combat roles {{until the end of}} the war. Manufacture of the He 111 ceased in September 1944, at which point piston-engine bomber production was largely halted in favour of fighter aircraft. With the German bomber force virtually defunct, the He 111 was used for logistics.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Mantua (1799) was {{a four-month}} {{effort by the}} Austrian army to regain a {{presence}} in northern Italy after being excluded from that region by Napoleon Bonaparte through the successful French Siege of Mantua in 1797. In April 1799, the Austrians placed a military blockade around Mantua as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> of the Second Coalition {{with the intent of}} withering the French by attrition. While the diminishing food supplies and losses weakened the French army, the Austrians received reinforcements and attacked on 4 July 1799.

5|$|The {{first officer}} to command No.410 Squadron was Squadron Leader P.Y. Davoud, {{who was in}} charge between 30 June 1941 and 4 September 1941. Wing Commander (W/C) M.

5|$|Troilus' {{death was}} also {{described}} in the Cypria, one of {{the parts of the}} Epic Cycle that is no longer extant.

Although the Cypria does not survive, most of an ancient summary of the contents, thought to be by Eutychius Proclus, remains. Fragment 1 mentions that Achilles killed Troilus, but provides no more detail. However, Sommerstein takes the verb used to describe the killing (phoneuei) as meaning that Achilles murders Troilus.|$|E
