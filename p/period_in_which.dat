Najm-ul-Hassan was dismissed from his job at Bombay Talkies (this was the <b>period</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> actors and actresses were paid regular monthly salaries by one specific film studio and could not work in any other studio).

5|$|From 1350 to 1400—the <b>period</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{the poem}} {{is thought to have}} been written—Wales {{experienced}} several raids {{at the hands of the}} English, who were attempting to colonise the area. The Gawain poet uses a North West Midlands dialect common on the Welsh–English border, potentially placing him in the midst of this conflict. Patricia Clare Ingham is credited with first viewing the poem through the lens of postcolonialism, and since then a great deal of dispute has emerged over the extent to which colonial differences play a role in the poem. Most critics agree that gender plays a role, but differ about whether gender supports the colonial ideals or replaces them as English and Welsh cultures interact in the poem.|$|E
