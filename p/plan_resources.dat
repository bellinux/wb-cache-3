40|$|The {{study of}} {{time-dependent}} univariate systems {{plays an important}} role in several physical and applied sciences. Time-series behaviour of such systems is mostly complex in nature and sophisticated mathematical modelling tools are needed for making accurate forecasts.

In the majority of successful applications of mathematical techniques used for forecasting, single point predictions are made. In this paper, a pattern recognition technique called Pattern Modelling and Recognition System (PMRS) is explored for making multiple forecasts into the future with four different time series. These multiple forecasts define a predicted behavioural profile of these univariate systems. These predicted profiles are compared against the actual behaviour of the studied systems on a number of error measures. The results show that the str [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Prediction {{of patient}} {{outcomes}} {{is critical to}} <b>plan</b> <b>resources</b> in an hospital emergency department. We present a method to exploit longitudinal data from Electronic Medical Records (EMR), whilst exploiting multiple patient outcomes. We divide the EMR data into segments where each segment is a task, and all tasks are associated with multiple patient outcomes over a 3, 6 and 12 month period. We propose a model that learns a prediction function for each task-label pair, interacting through two subspaces: the first subspace is used to impose sharing across all tasks for a given label. The second subspace captures the task-specific variations and is shared across all the labels for a given task. The proposed model is formulated as an iterative optimization problems and solved using a scalable and efficient Block co-ordinate descent (BCD) method. We apply the proposed model on two hospital cohorts - Cancer and Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) patients collected over a two year period from a large hospital emergency department. We show that the predictive performance of our proposed models is significantly better than those of several state-of-the-art multi-task and multi-label learning methods...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} developing a Construction Supply Chain Risk Management (CSCRM) framework that can be adapted by developing countries to help construction projects make better use of materials procurement in their organisations, and to improve construction project management by effectively controlling the project to avoid project cost overruns. The research is conducted in Myanmar and all the companies studied, including the case-studies, are operating in Myanmar. The proposed CSCRM framework includes the <b>plan,</b> <b>resources,</b> process and control model part. The model suggests the development of close relationships with various stakeholders of the project for better use of the Risk Management Model. Without a proper CSCRM framework, a construction company in Myanmar can encounter a cost overrun of about three times the estimated total cost. However, {{the use of the}} proposed CSCRM framework can minimize the cost overrun by amounts of two times the total project cost. The results of case studies in three construction companies in Myanmar confirm that the proposed model is effective in managing the supply chain of construction projects in Myanmar, with effective mitigation of cost overrun risks and maximization of competitive advantages of the company...|$|E

The context could, in fact, be any type of teaching and learning environment. The point is to balance approaches to teaching and learning depending on student profiles, the purpose of the learning, the resources available, etc. Teaching needs to be informed by research into learning as well as into the disciplinary area: both types of research lead to more scholarly teaching. Learning development is of primary interest to lecturers in higher education but also to teams that work on course development including instructional designers in distance education or multimedia designers.

40|$|Strategic {{planning}} {{is the most}} important and fundamental step in moving organizations to become more performance-oriented. An effective strategic planning system requires the strategic planning process to be linked with other management processes in an organization. This study investigates the strategic planning process to see how it is linked to other critical decision-making processes in a tax administration. Such study, specifically for tax administrations in developing countries is lacking in the literature. Data for this study was collected through interviews with tax officials of the Royal Malaysian Customs (RMC) which administers the indirect taxes. On the overall, the results reveal that the practices of the strategic planning system at RMC {{are similar to those of}} the international revenue bodies. However, some elements in the strategic planning process are inconsistent with the international practices and needed improvements. These are the areas related to stakeholders’ involvement in the strategic planning process, evaluation process of the strategic <b>plan,</b> <b>resources</b> issues, and performance measurement activities. Reflecting on the problems faced by RMC in achieving its strategic goals and objectives, the main issues are related to the lack of resources and lack of commitment from the tax employees...|$|E

As {{the proportion of}} wind-generated electricity in the US grows, changes in daily wind patterns have the potential either to disrupt the utility or increase the value of wind to the system over time. Wind power projects are designed to last many years, so at this timescale, climate change may become an influential factor on wind patterns. We examine the potential {{effects of climate change}} on the average diurnal power production cycles at 12 locations in North America by analyzing averaged and individual output from nine high-resolution regional climate models comprising historical (1971 – 1999) and future (2041 – 2069) periods. A semi-parametric mixed model is fit using cubic B-splines, and model diagnostics are checked. Then, a likelihood ratio test is applied to test for differences between the time periods in the seasonal daily averaged cycles, and agreement among the individual regional climate models is assessed. We investigate the significant changes by combining boxplots with a differencing approach and identify broad categories of changes in the amplitude, shape, and position of the average daily cycles. We then discuss the potential impact of these changes on wind power production...|$|E
