In respect of education and training in ultrasound scanning, little attention has been given to how scanning skills are acquired and what assists and hinders the learning process. This study aims to develop a framework for guiding learning in ultrasound scanning. Overt participant observation and semi-structured interviews generated data on four learners undertaking a 12 -month postgraduate ultrasound <b>programme.</b> <b>Narrative</b> analysis of the interview data was used to reveal dominant themes related to stages in learning to scan. Dominant themes associated with learning to scanwere communication with the patient, navigation skills, image interpretation skills, observation of expert practice, feedback on performance and random practise. Detailed interpretation of the themes through narrative analysis provided characteristics of learning for each stage of a four staged process. This study provides an insight into the key features of scan performance and how scanning skills are acquired over a four-staged approach. These themes and characteristics are presented in a frame-work for guiding learning in ultrasound scanning...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} interest in images {{of medicine in}} popular science fiction and in representations of doctors in television fiction. Surprisingly {{little attention has been}} paid to doctors administering space medicine in science fiction. This article redresses this gap. We analyse the evolving figure of ‘the doctor’ in different popular science fiction television series. Building upon debates within Medical Sociology, Cultural Studies and Media Studies we argue that the figure of ‘the doctor’ is discursively deployed to act as the moral compass at the centre of the <b>programme</b> <b>narrative.</b> Our analysis highlights that the qualities, norms and ethics represented by doctors in space (ships) are intertwined with issues of gender equality, speciesism and posthuman ethics. We explore the signifying practices and political articulations that are played out through these cultural imaginaries. For example, the ways in which ‘the simple country doctor’ is deployed to help establish hegemonic formations concerning potentially destabilising technoscientific futures involving alternative sexualities, or military dystopia. Doctors mostly function to provide the ethical point of narrative stability within a world in flux, referencing a nostalgia for the traditional, attentive, humanistic family physician. The science fiction doctor facilitates the personalisation of technological change and thus becomes a useful conduit through which societal fears and anxieties concerning medicine, bioethics and morality in a ‘post 9 / 11 ’ world can be expressed and explored...|$|E

In the <b>programme's</b> <b>narrative,</b> the Doctor is a centuries-old Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured beyond medical repair, he can regenerate his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality change, and a new actor assumes the role.

A quantitative and qualitative content analysis was undertaken of 140 hours of program-ming, across all genres, from four New Zealand television channels. Programmes were analysed for the prevalence of environmental content, which specific topics were mentioned and how the environment was positioned {{in relation to the}} <b>programme’s</b> <b>narrative.</b> The study found that television’s attention to the environment is relatively infrequent, with a diverse range of issues and perspectives. While these portrayals were almost always positive towards the environment, they were frequently linked to consumerist values, positioned as separate from everyday reality and were generally supportive of the social and political status quo. An exception to this was programming aimed at Maori audiences, where environmental issues were linked to traditional cultural knowledge and the natural world was of more relevance to everyday life...|$|R

In this article the author examines Janá�ek’s approach to programme music by considering his analyses of four of Dvo�ák’s symphonic poems. It is suggested that Dvo�ák’s symphonic poems, partly composed by ‘setting’ the Erben ballad texts which serve as their programme, {{had an impact on}} Janá�ek’s own development as a composer coming {{at a time when he}} had temporarily abandoned his opera JenŮfa and coinciding with his discovery of speech melodies. All of Janá�ek’s programmatic output is explored (chamber and solo-{{instrumental music}} as well as narrative symphonic poems) under a number of headings, such as works with programmatic titles, works with titles and short programmatic descriptions, post-composition programmes, suppressed programmes, secret <b>programmes</b> and <b>narrative</b> <b>programmes.</b> The strange discrepancy between Janá�ek’s <b>narrative</b> <b>programmes,</b> the actual music and Janá�ek’s later commentaries is noted and discussed as is Janá�ek’s tendency to pile on layers of programmatic significance to the extent, in one case, of making a work impossible to complete. As a whole it is suggested that while programmatic inspiration was important to Janá�ek in his instrumental works, this was merely a starting point and in most cases the crutch was then discarded with the music taking its own independent course...|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the Doctor, Jack {{is more of a}} conventional action hero, as well as outwardly flirtatious and capable of acts which the Doctor would view as less than noble. In the <b>programme's</b> <b>narrative,</b> Jack begins as a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century, who comes to travel with the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and his companion Rose (Billie Piper). As a consequence of his death and resurrection in the 2005 Doctor Who finale, Jack becomes immortal and is stranded on 19th century Earth. There he becomes a member of Torchwood, a British organization dedicated to combating alien threats. He spends over a century waiting to reunite with the Doctor, over which time he becomes Torchwood's leader. Eventually, he reunites with the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) for several appearances in Doctor Who. Aspects of the character's backstoryboth prior to meeting the Doctor, and during his many decades living on Earthare gradually revealed over Torchwood (and to a lesser extent, Doctor Who) through the use of flashback scenes and expository dialogue.|$|R

When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body, but in doing so, gains a new physical appearance and with it, a distinct new personality. This plot device has allowed a number of actors to portray different incarnations of the Doctor over the show's long run. The War Doctor, not so named within the episodes in which he appears, is introduced as the incarnation of the Doctor who fought in the Time War of the show's modern-day backstory.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to existing debates concerning television, nostalgia and genre. Drawing upon social constructionist approaches, the thesis theorises nostalgia as a discourse that is constructed through specific social, historical, cultural and, relating to television, institutional contexts. The thesis extends Paul Grainge’s (2000 a, 2002) work on nostalgic modes and combines it with Catherine Johnson’s (2005) analysis of television series’ textual strategies to propose an analytical framework examining individual case studies that locate constructions of nostalgia within specific production context(s). This involves considering how {{such factors as}} individual channel remits (e. g. public service or commercial), imagined target audiences and scheduling concerns impact upon nostalgic discourses articulated through a <b>programme’s</b> <b>narrative</b> and generic strategies. These ideas are examined through employing textual analysis and extending Richard Nowell’s (2011) industrially-focused conceptualisation of genre cycles’ historical development to television, focusing upon post- 2005 British time travel dramas and providing in-depth case studies of Doctor Who, Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes, Lost in Austen. Through adopting a textualist focus, this thesis re-engages debates concerning structured polysemy (Morley 1992, 1996) and, by demonstrating the multiple preferred reading positions that post- 2005 British time travel dramas construct, proposes the concept of layered polysemy. Layered polysemy suggests that constructions of nostalgia are readable through multiple imagined audience discourses {{as a result of}} their articulation in ‘coalition’ programmes designed to simultaneously attract multiple distinct and divergent audience niches arising from their position on mainstream broadcast channels in UK (BBC 1 and ITV 1). Layered polysemy constitutes a midpoint between textual determinism and arguments demonstrating myriad audience readings, sitting alongside arguments concerning television series’ ‘aesthetics of multiplicity’ (Ross 2008, Johnson 2012) but rejects the latter’s focus upon material and/or cultural sites external to the programmes themselves. Layered polysemy therefore complements wider arguments arising from this thesis regarding the retention of broadcast culture discourses within contemporary Television Studies...|$|R

40|$|Within the NHS, {{there has}} been {{endorsement}} of a central role for clinical leaders in the organisation, where clinical leadership is defined as leadership for clinicians, by clinicians. This {{is a reflection of}} recent attempts by the NHS to move from a hierarchical, command-and-control, transactional model of leadership, to one based on a transformational, distributed approach. Assumptions have been made that new models can be adopted within the organisation at clinical level, but literature has identified significant challenges in the introduction of a clinical leadership model. Notable is the long-standing divide between clinicians and managers, with clinicians tending to denigrate the role of managers in the organisation. In addition to this, leadership development has often been unstructured and post hoc in the NHS, but recent policy has suggested a new approach, where clinical leaders are offered timely and appropriate development. The question arises, how do clinicians make a transition to clinical leadership, and what factors influence the construction and enactment of a clinical leader identity? To address issues of identity construction in clinical leadership, I focus on the case of midwifery, where {{there has been}} a struggle to attain a distinctive professional identity within the NHS. The profession has been singled out for attention in recent reports, on the basis of concerns relating to the ageing workforce profile and the devastating impact of poor or ineffective leadership. I use an in-depth case study approach, incorporating observation of three midwifery-focused leadership development <b>programmes,</b> <b>narrative</b> interviews with nine midwifery leaders, and interaction with an online midwifery forum, in order to gain insight into the challenges facing midwives who make the transition to leadership roles in the NHS. Using role and social identity perspectives, I explore the complex interaction between individuals, professional group and wider organisational structures in clinical leadership identity construction and enactment. I challenge ideas of shared language and identity within the midwifery profession, demonstrating the destructive nature of conflict within the professional group, and I address the challenges faced by the profession in establishing a distinctive identity at the organisational level. Both of these issues are found to be important in the construction and enactment of a clinical leadership identity...|$|R
40|$|Text in EnglishIn {{order to}} address the paucity of {{knowledge}} {{in regard to the}} psychological and physiological processes associated with lifelong weight loss (> 20 years), this study adopts a qualitative approach informed by phenomenology to explore the experience of lifelong weight loss and maintenance of women who participated in the ITAND Programme. The research questions guiding the exploration of the current research are: (i) Which strategies from the ITAND Programme do women perceive as assisting with initial weight loss? (ii) What are the processes mediating lifelong weight loss? (iii) What strategies and skills mediate the maintenance of lifelong weight loss? (iv) What feelings or beliefs motivate women to continue attempts to lose weight after experiencing multiple failures on diets? and (v) Which psychological, cognitive and behavioural processes are identified as mediating lifelong weight loss? Eight overweight and obese women were invited to write their narratives and engage in interviews in regard to exploring their relationships with food, their bodies and their weight, after a period of more than 20 years following their participation in an integrative, transactional analysis, anti-diet programme (the ITAND <b>Programme).</b> <b>Narratives</b> were used to explore their beliefs about constructs, processes and strategies mediating long-term weight loss maintenance. The participants’ narratives and interviews were analysed through applying narrative analysis and interpretive phenomenological analysis. In addition to a non-diet paradigm, four processes definingweight loss maintenance were identified, including the adult learning process of transformative learning, the psychological process of transactional analysis, the physiological process of intuitive eating and the cognitive-behavioural processes relating to weight loss maintenance. This study contributes an integrative, transactional analysis, non-diet treatment model (ITAND model) which is enabled by the processes of transformative learning, intuitive eating and cognitive-behaviour modification to the successful long- term treatment of overweight and obesity. This model may be applied {{in whole or in part}} in a primary health care or community context.

40|$|Introduction: New Zealand (NZ) {{ratified}} the Kyoto Protocol in 2002, committing to prudent greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. In {{an effort to}} promote public sector carbon management, in 2004, Clark’s Labour-led Government funded local government membership in ICLEI’s Communities for Climate Protection - NZ (CCP-NZ) programme. In 2007, the same Government, in tandem with efforts to price carbon and develop an Emissions Trading Scheme, through the Carbon Neutral Public Service (CNPS) programme, sought to move the core public sector towards carbon neutrality (Clark, 2007 c). In 2008, the NZ government changed from a Labour-led to a National-led Government, and {{this resulted in a}} shift in its carbon emission mitigation strategy, including the termination of the CNPS and the CCP-NZ programmes. Purpose: The research has two central objectives: First, to determine why NZ’s newly elected National -led Government cancelled the CNPS and the CCP-NZ programmes; and, second, to determine whether despite the discontinuation of these two programmes {{and in the absence of}} Government support, will NZ government organizations continue to strive for carbon emission reductions and neutrality. Approach: This empirical research is investigative and probing, and comprises a series of semi-structured interviews with senior managers responsible for the delivery of the CNPS and the CCP-NZ programmes within their respective organization. The architects of each programme (e. g. the NZ Prime Minister and CEO of ICLEI/ Director of ICLEI Oceania) are also investigated in order to glean insight into the rationale for the ultimate termination of these two programmes. Fieldwork is informed by publicly available information that provides insight into Government’s rationale for creating and discontinuing the CNPS and the CCP-NZ <b>programmes.</b> <b>Narrative</b> analysis and termination theory serve as the primary methodological tools for this study, providing insight into meaning, interpretation and individual experience as it relates to the dismantling of the CNPS and the CCP-NZ programmes. Findings: This study finds that though economic constraints and programmatic inefficiencies may have played a contributing role, political ideology is the primary rationale for the termination of the CNPS and the CCP-NZ programmes. With the ideological shift towards strong neoliberal market environmentalism, Government support for initiatives like the CNPS and the CCP-NZ programmes has declined markedly, with the desire to demonstrate leadership in this area in complete retreat. Ultimately, notwithstanding the desire of some government organizations to continue with programme objectives, albeit with less priority, NZ public sector organizational resolve towards these goals has weakened...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to research on media representations of care with a textual analysis of BBC children’s television. As {{a public service}} broadcaster, the BBC is tasked with the fostering and sustaining of citizenship. This paper argues that representations of care are an important way by which the BBC can potentially meet its remit and inform children’s perceptions of informal care. It takes a focused look at the portrayal of grandparent-grandchild relationships of care in three programmes: ‘Mr Alzheimer’s and Me’, Katie Morag and Topsy and Tim. All three <b>programmes</b> show <b>narrative</b> moments which map onto Tronto’s (1998; 2003) concept of good care, including attentiveness, responsibility, competence, responsiveness, solidarity and trust. Grandparents and grandchildren are shown to be caring for each other. However, programmes do not challenge the inequalities which continue to structure the realities of informal care work. Neither the inequalities of power between carers and care receivers, nor the lack of public and government support for carers are addressed, and adult informal care is gendered. This paper argues that while BBC children’s programmes provide important opportunities for children to learn the meaning of good care, in order for it to meet its public service remit, it should also provide opportunities {{to learn about the}} relationships of power that structure informal care...|$|R

The neo-Darwinian perspective demands a replicator in culture which is analogous to the gene in biology and the candidate for that replicator has become know as the meme. The abduction of a narrative orientated methodology for searching for such a replicator is explained and its application demonstrated through an example of coded data. The analysis is based on a structural narrative approach and in particular on the notion of <b>narrative</b> <b>programmes</b> which interact and perhaps compete in social environments. Following concluding remarks the next steps of my PhD work are described. KEY WORDS: Meme, Memetics, Narrative, Complexit...|$|R
40|$|Background The study {{objective}} was to investigate and synthesize available evidence relating to the psychological health of Emergency Dispatch Centre (EDC) operatives, and to identify key stressors experienced by EDC operatives. Methods Eight electronic databases (Embase, PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, PsycArticles, The Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, and Google Scholar) were searched. All study designs were included, and no date limits were set. Studies were included if they were published in English, and explored the psychological health of any EDC operatives, across fire, police, and emergency medical services. Studies were excluded if they related solely to other emergency workers, such as police officers or paramedics. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using checklists adapted from the Critical Appraisal Skills <b>Programme.</b> A <b>narrative</b> synthesis was conducted, using thematic analysis. Results A total of 16 articles {{were included in the}} review. Two overarching themes were identified during the narrative synthesis: ‘Organisational and Operational Factors’ and ‘Interactions with Others’. Stressors identified included being exposed to traumatic calls, lacking control over high workload, and working in under-resourced and pressured environments. Lack of support from management and providing an emotionally demanding service were additional sources of stress. Peer support and social support from friends and family were helpful in managing work-related stress. Discussion EDC operatives experience stress {{as a result of their}} work, which appears to be related to negative psychological health outcomes. Future research should explore the long-term effects of this stress, and the potential for workplace interventions to alleviate the negative impacts on psychological health.

40|$|Television is {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the best}} mediums to effectively access a great number of people within a nation and unite them by communicating stories which help them understand and feel they belong to a country. Shared meanings of nationhood are constructed in narrative form (Barker, 1999) and it is television's use of images that adds character and places it in a superior position to radio and print in eliciting a direct response from the audience (Corner, 1995). This paper uses critical discourse analysis to examine the narrative structure of an episode of the New Zealand television series Heartland, titled “East Coast – Towards the Light ” to investigate the way it constructs a national identity for New Zealanders. It is argued that the <b>programme</b> uses a <b>narrative</b> structure similar to that described by French structuralist Tzevetan Todorov (1971) of equilibrium-disequilibrium-equilibrium whereby anxieties are raised within the audience psyche and then resolved in order to convey a positive message for New Zealanders- that in spite of differences whether ethnic, cultural or socio-economic- they can all be part of a united nation...|$|R
5000|$|Mahler {{initially}} {{devised a}} <b>narrative</b> <b>programme</b> (actually several variant versions) for the work, which {{he shared with}} a number of friends (including Natalie Bauer-Lechner and Max Marschalk). He even had one of these versions printed in the program book at the premiere in Dresden on 20 December 1901. In this programme, the first movement represents a funeral and asks questions such as [...] "Is there life after death?"; the second movement is a remembrance of happy times {{in the life of the}} deceased; the third movement represents a view of life as meaningless activity; the fourth movement is a wish for release from life without meaning and the fifth movement - after a return of the doubts of the third movement and the questions of the first - ends with a fervent hope for everlasting, transcendent renewal, a theme that Mahler would ultimately transfigure into the music of his Das Lied von der Erde. [...] As generally happened, Mahler later withdrew all versions of the programme from circulation.|$|R

Este artigo propõe-se a analisar a condição do estrangeiro considerando a visão filosófica de Paul Ricoeur no que concerne à constituição do sujeito capaz e do conceito de reconhecimento. O referencial teórico empregado contribui para verificar que historicamente o estrangeiro vivencia formas de exclusão social e política, consubstanciada na antítese gregos x bárbaros, ainda persistente no imaginário atual. O projeto educacional da construção narrativa de subjetividades voltadas para o reconhecimento do outro favorece a eliminação da discriminação contra o estrangeiro e garante a afirmação dos direitos a ele inerentes. Trata-se de ampliar as fronteiras do reconhecimento e de discutir os campos conceituais importantes para o desenvolvimento do sentimento de justiça que permeia o debate civilizatório.

40|$|The {{notion of}} social justice in {{education}} involves examining how experiences are shaped in schools through interconnecting systems of socialisation. The focus of this inquiry centred on exploring mechanisms which challenge trainee teachers’ normalised assumptions of equality. Using a case study approach I investigated whether experiences prior to the training process or the instructional pedagogies employed had the greatest influence in the shaping of socially responsible teachers. The study was carried out on a primary PGCE programme {{with a total of}} fifteen participants over two years. Through an interpretative paradigm the cyclical hermeneutic was employed to analyse participants’ critically reflective responses to their teacher development. Participants’ prior experiences were captured and coded to determine an awareness of the ‘Other’, related to visible and invisible identity salience, and of equality issues. These data were available {{in the form of a}} semi structured questionnaire and autobiographical accounts. Throughout the <b>programme</b> participants’ <b>narrative</b> reflections of the instructional pedagogies employed for social justice encounters were also coded to determine participants’ capacity to integrate the instruction in terms of considering the pupils they will teach. Further critical reflections identified which participants were capable of countering deficit stereotypes of pupils during teaching practice. In contributing to knowledge in the field this study identifies that it is possible to predict ITT candidates’ propensity for social responsibility in the classroom. The analysis of data revealed that a trainee’s sense of responsibility towards ‘the other’ coupled with the level of criticality employed in their reflective practice is directly related to their capacity to become a socially responsible teacher. Coherent guidance and expectations employed through the instructional programme encouraged socially aware trainees to act upon this when teaching. This study confirms the need to closely examine the coherence of ITT programmes in guiding trainees’ social justice awareness...|$|R
40|$|Nurses face ethical {{challenges}} {{in their everyday}} practice. Difficulties getting to know ‘right’ from ‘wrong’ can result in moral distress of nurses. Nursing educators have acknowledged the critical importance of having an ethical component taught throughout the nursing curriculum {{in order to promote}} nursing students’ ethical awareness. Yet for all of this, there is very little New Zealand research available that explores what experiences and challenges nursing educators faced teaching such content. A case study of teaching nursing ethics in a New Zealand tertiary education context was therefore conducted and seven nursing educators were interviewed to ascertain their experiences of teaching ethics to trainee nurses. One of the major difficulties identified was the friction between a culturally specific perspective and universalist one where hard-and-fast principles or codes dictated ethical practice. As the interviewees agreed, the challenge in teaching ethics lies in the changing context of nursing and the changing context of ethics itself. Despite such hurdles, the nursing educators in this study were confident teachers who all had positive experiences in teaching ethics to their students. That ethics be integrated throughout the whole nursing <b>programme</b> using textual <b>narratives</b> was a further point of consensus...|$|R
