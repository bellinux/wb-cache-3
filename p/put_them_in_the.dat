There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E

5|$|Then the Colts faced their arch-rival New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. New England {{jumped to}} an early 21–3 lead, but Indianapolis stormed {{back in the second}} half, outscoring the Patriots 32–13 with an {{additional}} field goal late in the first half. With 2:22 left in the game, the Colts had the ball on their own 20-yard line trailing 34–31. On the first four plays of the drive, Manning completed three passes, moving the ball 69yards to the Patriots 11-yard line in just 24 seconds. Three plays later, Addai scored a 3-yard touchdown run to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lead, 38–34 with only 60 seconds left in regulation. The Patriots responded with a drive to the Colts 45-yard line, but defensive back Marlin Jackson ended the drive with an interception to give Indianapolis the win. This happened to be the biggest comeback in AFC-NFC Conference Championship history.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{won their}} fifth {{game of the}} season against the Baltimore Colts on a muddy field during a rainstorm. Led by quarterback Y. A. Tittle, the Colts began the scoring on the fourth play of the game with a 78-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Billy Hillenbrand. A few minutes later, the Browns evened the score after a pass from Graham set up a short touchdown run by Edgar Jones. The Colts retook the lead in the second quarter with a field goal by Rex Grossman and led 10–7 at the half. Focusing on the running game because of the muddy conditions, the Browns scored a touchdown in the third quarter that <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lead for good. Jones, who was returning from a rib injury, finished the day with 61 yards and two touchdowns, while Motley ran for 130 yards. The slippery and windy conditions caused miscues on both sides. Tittle and Motley had fumbles, and Cleveland botched a fake field goal attempt in the second quarter. The final score was 14–10. While the Browns had won their first five games, the San Francisco 49ers were {{at the top of the}} AAFC's eastern division standings, having won all six of their games.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{possessed a}} {{numerical}} superiority {{of two to}} one, and their advanced post, commanded by Claude Louis, Comte de Saint-Germain, overlooked all parts of Frederick's camp. The French and Habsburg Imperial (Reichsarmee) troops consisted of 62 battalions (31,000 infantry), 84 squadrons (10,000) of cavalry, and 109 artillery, totaling some 4142,000 men, under Soubise's and Saxe-Hildburghausen's command. The Allies had {{taken the lead in}} the maneuvers of the previous days, and Hildburghausen decided to take the offensive. He had some difficulty inducing Soubise to risk a battle, so the Allies did not begin to move from their campground until after eleven a.m. on 5 November. Soubise probably intended to engage as late in the day as possible, with the idea of gaining what advantages he could in a partial action before nightfall. Their plan called for the Allied army to march by Zeuchfeld, around Frederick's left, which no serious natural obstacle covered, and to deploy in battle array facing north, between Reichardtswerben on the right and Pettstädt on the left. Saxe-Hildburghausen's proposed battle and the more limited aim of Soubise appeared equally likely to succeed by taking this position, which threatened to cut Frederick off from a retreat to the towns on the Saale. The Allies could only attain this position by marching around the Prussian flank, which could <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tenuous position of marching across their enemies' front. Consequently, the Allies posted a sizable guard against the obvious risk of interference on their exposed flank.|$|E

25|$|Baylor {{controlled}} {{the ball for}} most of the first half, gaining a total of 166 yards. However, it was a pair of touchdown runs by Oklahoma's Chris Brown, both in the second quarter, that put the Sooners up 14–7 at halftime. Baylor's points came during a drive that started on their own 41-yard line and included a 43-yard pass that <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> red zone. In the second half, Oklahoma's offense failed to capitalize in the red zone on several occasions. The Oklahoma offense progressed to inside the Baylor 20-yard line four times but was forced to settle for a field goal each time. Oklahoma's kicker Jimmy Stevens was 4-for-4, making field goals of 35, 25, 21, and 24 yards. Oklahoma did not score a touchdown in the second half until within the five-minute mark to put them up 33–7. Baylor went three-and-out in their next possession and Oklahoma ran out the clock to end the game.|$|E
25|$|Applewhite was {{the backup}} for Simms for the {{entirety}} of the 2001 regular season and Simms led Texas to a #3 ranking and a trip to the Big 12 Championship against #10 Colorado. But in that game Applewhite got the opportunity to go out as a starter and a hero. Because of an upset loss by Florida earlier in the day, Texas went into that game knowing that a win would <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> BCS Championship Game. But Simms had a disastrous game and was responsible for four turnovers (three interceptions and a fumble) {{in the first half of}} play. Meanwhile, Major was seen attempting to rally the offense before they took to the field, even as the restless Texas fans booed Simms. Two plays later, Simms injured his finger and Applewhite entered the game with Texas down 29-10. His second pass was completed for a 79-yard touchdown and he baited the University of Colorado bench in an attempt to rally the Texas fans. He led Texas back to within 2 points, but eventually Texas would come up short losing 39-37 after an onside kick attempt failed.|$|E
25|$|An {{exchange}} of three punts brought the game {{into the second}} quarter, where Morris ran for 34 yards on the second play of a Patriots drive to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Broncos' red zone yet again. Four plays later, on 4th-and-1 from the Broncos' 4-yard line, Morris ran for a 4-yard touchdown that gave the Patriots a 13–0 lead. The Broncos' next drive ended with Meriweather intercepting a deep throw by Cutler, setting up the Patriots' next series at their own 16-yard line. After a sack of Cassel put the Patriots even deeper into their own territory, a facemask penalty on Cassel on third down by Broncos linebacker Jamie Winborn gave the Patriots {{a new set of}} downs. Five plays later, on another 4th-and-1, Morris ran for 29 yards to give the Patriots a first down from the Broncos' 13-yard line; he ran for a total of 138 yards on 16 carries. On the next play, Moss caught a 13-yard touchdown pass from Cassel to extend the Patriots' lead to 20–0. The Broncos' next drive began with backup Patrick Ramsey replacing Cutler at quarterback. On the fourth play, defensive lineman Mike Wright sacked Ramsey and forced a fumble, which undrafted free agent linebacker Gary Guyton caught to give the Patriots the ball at midfield. Cassel suffered his fifth sack on the next play, the final of the first half.|$|E

25|$|The 1980s of Peruvian {{football}} {{began to}} see notable changes in the competition format. The 1982 season saw the tournament played in group stages. Universitario advanced from its Metropolitan Group to Group B of the second stage and finally to the four-team group final, known as the Liguilla. Universitario successfully defeated all of its opponents in the Liguilla and reached its sixteenth first division title. The decisive victory was against Deportivo Municipal after a lone goal by Hugo Gastulo. In 1985, José Luis Carranza, to become an important icon of the club, debuted on the first team. Universitario won the Torneo Regional, or Regional Tournament, of the early season successfully remained {{at the top of}} the league by advancing to the Liguilla by placing second in the Torneo Descentrlizado and conquering the Liguilla by winning all five matches played, the last of which was a 4–0 win over Los Espartanos de Pacasmayo with goals by Miguel Seminario, Fidel Suárez, Eduardo Rey Muñoz and Jaime Drago. As Universitario won both tournaments of the season, they were automatically declared 1985 champions. Universitario de Deportes returned to the top of Peruvian football in 1987. As in 1985, Universitario began the season by winning the Regional Tournament, which <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season final to face off the winner of the Descentralizado for the national title. The Descentralizado went to their classic rival, Alianza Lima which meant the season final would be contested as another edition of the Clásico. In addition, both Universitario and Alianza Lima reached the final with seventeen first division titles under their belts. The defining derby was won by Universitario with a single goal by Fidel Suárez, overcoming the tie they had in the most Peruvian titles. In 1990, with the arrival of Fernando Cuellar as coach, Universitario de Deportes won the First Regional Tournament of the season, automatically advancing to the season final where they faced Sport Boys, winner of the Second Regional Tournament.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} round of the playoffs, Philadelphia faced Indiana yet again. In Game One, the 76ers wasted an 18-point lead and lost, 79–78, when Reggie Miller hit a three-pointer in the closing seconds. Philadelphia fought back, however, and took the next three games to win the series. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Sixers squared off against the Toronto Raptors and their superstar, Vince Carter. The teams alternated wins in the first four games, with Iverson scoring 54 points in Philadelphia's Game Two victory. A Game Five win (with Iverson scoring 52 in a 121–88 rout) and Game Six loss set up a decisive Game Seven, which the 76ers survived as Carter missed a long jump shot at the buzzer for an 88–87 victory that sent the Sixers to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Milwaukee Bucks. After the teams split the first two games of the series in Philadelphia, it was learned Iverson would miss Game Three due to various nagging {{injuries}} that had plagued him late in the season. Though most predicted a Milwaukee cakewalk, the 76ers kept the game close before falling, 80–74. Philadelphia seemed to gain momentum despite the loss, and they would win Games Four and Five. Milwaukee put any Sixer celebration plans on hold by building up a 33-point lead in the third quarter of Game Six, but the 76ers would make a furious fourth-quarter rally before falling 110–100. Struggling in the series up to that point, Iverson scored 26 points in the final quarter to finish with 46 on the night and appeared to have gotten a second wind. In Game Seven, the Bucks jumped out to a 34–25 second quarter advantage before seldom-used reserve Raja Bell scored 10 points to spark a 23–4 run that gave Philadelphia the lead for good. Iverson scored 44 points and the 76ers pulled away in the second half, winning by a 108–91 score to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NBA Finals for the first time since 1983. As had been the case in their three previous Finals appearances, their opponent would be the Los Angeles Lakers, who had run up an 11–0 record in the first three rounds of the playoffs and were expected by many to make quick work of a worn-down 76ers squad. Because of a seemingly meaningless loss to the lowly Chicago Bulls in the regular season finale (both the Sixers and the Lakers finished with identical 56–26 records, but Los Angeles was awarded a higher seed based on tiebreakers), the NBA Finals marked the first time in the 2001 playoffs in which the 76ers had to start a series on the road.|$|E
