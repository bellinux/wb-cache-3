5|$|Despite {{the violent}} {{overthrow}} of the communist government by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front in 1991, the airline managed to post a <b>profit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fiscal year. The market-oriented policies {{of the new government}} meant that the airline would remain operationally independent, and under Captain Bisrat Nigatu the airline remained fiscally sound, despite disruptions caused by the Eritrean-Ethiopian War.|$|E

5|$|According to The Washington Times writer Rick Snyder, Vogel did {{not know}} the horse racing {{business}} and made mistakes that negatively affected the industry in Maryland. The year-round racing Rosecroft was awarded lowered the excitement for the locals. Rosecroft was not capable of attracting a new market, and attendance figures declined. He never focused on marketing or daily operations of Rosecroft. Instead, Vogel focused more on his real estate business. As a result, the attendance dropped. Vogel took out money from the betting pools to help his real estate business. Lower betting pools mean smaller payouts for the bettors and less <b>profit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> racetrack owners. Vogel never formed political ties to help pass legislation used to help harness racing, more specially to allow off-track betting and to lower the state tax on betting pools.|$|E
5|$|Undismayed by {{the loss}} of his papers, Bottomley {{embarked}} on an ambitious expansion scheme. On the basis of a lucrative contract to print the Hansard reports of debates in the Westminster parliament, at the beginning of 1889 he founded the Hansard Publishing Union Limited, floated on the London Stock Exchange with a capital of £500,000. Bottomley boosted the company's credentials by persuading several notable City figures to join the company's board of directors. These included Sir Henry Isaacs, the Lord Mayor-elect of London, Coleridge Kennard, co-founder (with Harry Marks) of the London Evening News, and Sir Roper Lethbridge, the Conservative MP for Kensington North. This board approved the purchase by Bottomley of several printing businesses—he used intermediaries to disguise his considerable personal profits from these transactions. He also persuaded the board to give him £75,000 as a down payment for some publishing firms in Austria for which he was negotiating, although the firms were not acquired. These outgoings and other expenses absorbed the Union's capital, and with few significant revenue streams it quickly ran out of money. Nonetheless, without any statement of accounts, in July 1890 Bottomley announced a <b>profit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> year of £40,877, and declared a dividend of eight per cent.|$|E

25|$|When it {{was opened}} in 1826, Sing Sing was {{considered}} a model prison, because it turned a <b>profit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> state, and by October 1828, was finally completed.

25|$|At this stage, Ansett {{announced}} an unexpectedly high <b>profit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> year—A$149 million—and News Limited {{took advantage of}} that to raise the asking price to A$1 billion.

25|$|Supporters of {{the stadium}} claimed that {{building}} a second stadium in Portland would make bids {{on behalf of the}} city to the International Olympic Committee more feasible.

Increases in programme cost during 2008 included new sporting contracts with the GAA and UEFA, the first renewal of its contract with the British broadcaster ITV for shows such as The X Factor and Coronation Street, a small but significant increase in programmes commissioned from independent producers. It also increased investment in online technology, with its online service earning a <b>profit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{economic}} consequences {{of the social and}} regional disparities is a sharp increase in Angolan private investments abroad. The small fringe of Angolan society where most of the accumulation takes place seeks to spread its assets, for reasons of security and <b>profit.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> time being, the biggest share of these investments is concentrated in Portugal where the Angolan presence (including that of the family of the state president) in banks {{as well as in the}} domains of energy, telecommunications, and mass media has become notable, as has the acquisition of vineyards and orchards as well as of touristic enterprises.|$|E

25|$|Corbyn claims renationalisation {{would save}} money by both joining up a {{fragmented}} market, thereby reducing duplication in the privatised rail market (estimated by Ian Taylor as costing up to £1.2 billion in a 2012 report written for trade unions, but the Rail Delivery Group notes this amount includes the cost of leasing trains {{as well as the}} cost of Network Rail using private contractors, something which British Rail did as well, thus would be an inaccurate estimate of savings) and keeping what is currently <b>profit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> energy and train operating companies. Both the energy and the train operating companies claim that they make a low return on their money (3.9% for the energy companies and 3.4% for the train companies).|$|E
25|$|Although the {{freighting}} business remained brisk and {{the cars}} were a favourite with travelers, they never turned a very large <b>profit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> company. Although private operators could discontinue their services when the road conditions were poor, the BC Express Company had advertised automobile services in all weather conditions from May to October. Fulfilling that promise meant that a large crew of mechanics and drivers had to be kept on staff. In 1913, it cost the company $67,233 to maintain their fleet of 8 Wintons. The largest sum went for repairs, but $15,835.53 was spent on tires alone. Furthermore the total profits that were made that season was only $3,337.23, which the company believed was not a large figure considering the risk and investment involved.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{widespread}} use of the Internet by businesses and corporations drives down energy costs. Besides the fact that Internet usage does not consume large amounts of energy, businesses who utilize connections {{no longer have to}} ship, stock, heat, cool, and light unsellable items whose lack of consumption not only yields less <b>profit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> company but also wastes more energy. Online shopping contributes to less fuel use: a 10-pound package via airmail uses 40% less fuel than a trip to buy that same package at a local mall, or shipping via railroad. Researchers in 2000 predicted a continuing decline in energy due to Internet consumption to save 2.7 million tons of paper per year, yielding a decrease by 10 million tons of carbon dioxide globalwarming pollution per year.|$|E
