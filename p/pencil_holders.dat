5000|$|Bosse {{also turned}} {{his efforts to}} small, {{everyday}} items such as letter openers, keyrings, corkscrews, and <b>pencil</b> <b>holders,</b> all of which bear his distinctive [...] "black and gold" [...] look. A number of Bosse’s designs began to gain widespread popularity internationally, particularly his brass hedgehog ashtrays and hand-shaped bowls. But the designs' success led to forgeries popping up worldwide. His hedgehog ashtrays were reproduced by many forgers in various countries and {{with varying degrees of}} precision. To protect his designs, he engaged in court battles which would last {{the rest of his life}} and deplete most of his money. Because of these cases, he is considered to be a seminal figure relating to modern copyright law for designer goods.|$|E

40|$|Intergenerational {{programs}} {{are most effective}} when adaptive equipment is used as appropriate. There is a chance that clients in an intergenerational program will need adaptive equipment. The primary reason to consider adaptive equipment is to remove barriers to participation. Examples of adaptive equipment include <b>pencil</b> <b>holders</b> for slip resistance, magnifying glasses or digital projectors for better viewing, and chair supports or lifts for improved positioning. This equipment is often essential to engagement in the activity and with an intergenerational partner. Application of the Practice As a teacher or care provider, question what may help remove a barrier or enhance a learning situation. Sometimes creative solutions for adaptations involve Velcro, pillows, longer handles, or pulleys. Organizations are available to consult on particular needs, such as the Training and Technical Assistance Center (T/TAC; www. ttac. vt. edu) for students in Virginia; and online retailers and DIY sites, such as www. enablemart. com, www. seniorssuperstores. com, and www. pinterest. com/otconsulting/ diy-adapt/, offer resources.

40|$|Why is {{programming}} fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward? First is {{the sheer}} joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things {{of his own}} design. I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things, a delight shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake. Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want others to use our work and to find it helpful. In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child's first clay <b>pencil</b> <b>holder</b> “for Daddy's office. ” Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning.

As Monk is about to ask Officer Curtis to find another <b>pencil</b> <b>holder,</b> Bertrum Gruber walks into the station to say he has found the Golden Gate Strangler. Bertrum says {{he was at the}} community garden in McKinley Park watering his strawberries when he saw a man clutching a shoe to his chest like it was made of gold. The man then got into his 1999 Ford Taurus, which had a broken left rear taillight and a dent on the bumper. Bertrum continues, saying that {{the last part of the}} license plate number was M567, like his mother's birthday (May 5, 1967). Monk has Officer Curtis search for any Ford Tauruses with M567 as the last four digits of the license plate number. Monk believes, however, that Bertrum is being partially dishonest about his facts, since it's not a proper time to grow strawberries.|$|R
50|$|The Eagle Pencil Company {{founded in}} the 1800s in Yonkers, New York on John Street. After 5 years, Daniel Berozlzheimer’s son Henry {{purchased}} the city’s first iron framed building for the new factory. The company produced pens, <b>pencils,</b> pen <b>holders</b> and erasers. In 1897, the London branch confirmed the policy of selling manufactured goods with high quality. Over the years, the company changed focus and goods. In 1952, Margros Ltd was founded by Mr. P.G.Hooley, who invented Powdered Colour and sold it directly to schools. Business grew such that the owners were unable to finance operations adequately, and the company was sold to Eagle Pencil Company in 1967.|$|R
50|$|Any {{number of}} wind {{measurements}} or navigation calculations could {{be carried out}} on the compass face using the wind gauge bar. This was normally stowed folded {{against the back of}} the height bar, but could be rotated down and to the rear to lie over the compass. The cursor slid along the wind bar, allowing the bomb aimer to measure different airspeeds or times. A small scale on the cursor allowed for the conversion of indicated air speed to true air speed, which differs depending on altitude. A small ring on the right side of the cursor was used to accurately place markings on the compass using the grease <b>pencil.</b> A <b>holder</b> for the <b>pencil</b> and a sharpener blade were attached on the left side of the case.|$|R
5000|$|On 15 May 1948, Puerto Rico adopted Act No. 221, the Games of Chance Act, {{which allowed}} {{regulated}} casino gambling but disallowed advertisement of gambling establishments {{within the boundaries}} of Puerto Rico. In 1978, the Texas-based Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates, which hosted a gambling facility at the Condado Holiday Inn and Sands Casino, was fined twice by the Puerto Rico Tourism Company for such advertising. In 1979, the Tourism Company sent a memo to casino operators further clarifying restrictions on advertising to include [...] "the use of the word 'casino' in matchbooks, lighters, envelopes, inter-office and/or external correspondence, invoices, napkins, brochures, menus, elevators, glasses, plates, lobbies, banners, flyers, paper <b>holders,</b> <b>pencils,</b> telephone books, directories, bulletin boards or in any hotel dependency or object which may be accessible to the public in Puerto Rico."

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{graduation}} {{project is}} to assess the feasibility of the photonic technology called diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) to aid in intraoperative margin assessment {{with the goal of}} obtaining clear margins for liver, breast and soft tissue tumors. The idea is to integrate optical fibers in the existing and widely used electrosurgical knife, which consists of a <b>pencil</b> <b>holder</b> and a blade electrode. The work consists of workflow analyses and experiments. Based on the former the role of DRS in clinical practice can be specified. The main object of the experiments is to find out if DRS is still usable when a layer of coagulated tissue due to electrosurgical activity is present. Lumpectomy workflows using four techniques are investigated. For palpable tumors intraoperative ultrasound (US) and palpation are used, while non-palpable tumors require iodine seeds or placement of a guidewire. The most important limitations of current methods include: no information about the actual margin for iodine seeds and guidewire procedures, complex patient preparation, expertise required to understand US images and lack of reinforced learning for palpation. One advantage of all techniques is that they provide extra information, allowing the surgeon to create a more detailed mental image of the tumor. Ultrasound provides continuous information on the margin, while palpation is very intuitive. DRS integrated into the electrosurgical instrument provides distinct benefits in the local assessment phase, including direct feedback on whether or not to make a cut without losing information. DRS sensing should be directed forward, parallel to the axis of the pencil. In the experimental phase the shape and size of the tissue area influenced by electrosurgical treatment is inves- tigated first. It is found that layers of coagulation up to 1. 4 mm may occur in surgery. Next, experiments are performed to identify the effect of coagulation on DRS spectra. Protein denaturation and reduced water con- tent are clearly visible in the diffuse reflectance spectra, resulting in a decreased slope and increased intensities of peaks in the near-infrared (NIR) range. Spectral alterations are severe, requiring further investigation using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Two-layered MC models that consist of coagulated tissue on top of normal tissue are build for coagulation up to 1. 5 mm. Using the slope and peaks described above a predictive model is created, based on a sigmoid fit of these so-called predictors. Coagulation depth is predicted with R 2 values up to 0. 99, indicating a valid model. Two-layered MC models of normal and tumor tissue show that breast tumors can be detected up to 4 mm, liver tumors are visible at 2 mm and lipoma in skeletal muscle can be seen at 5 mm when the fiber distance (FD) = 6 mm. Finally, three-layered MC models of coagulated, normal and tumor tissue yield predictors that strongly differ from tissue without tumor presence. No predictive model for tumor depth is created. The results from this project show that accurate depth determination of coagulation is possible as well as sensing the presence of a tumor within the sensing zone. The latter ensures that DRS may bring at least the same qual- ities as iodine seeds and the guidewire. An important benefit is that DRS provides information on the complete margin, rather than a discrete point. Quantitative depth prediction is required to compete with intraoperative US for invasive tumors. Overall, it was shown that if DRS is successfully developed it can bring important benefits to clinical practice. The effect of tissue coagulation on diffuse reflectance spectra is large, but can be accounted for with a mathemat- ical predictive model. The next crucial step is further investigation of tumor depth sensing and investigation of a complete predictive model. The depth sensing requirements are only completely met for breast tumors. For liver resection, tumors are only detected up to 2 mm. This means that the desired 1 cm margin cannot be safeguarded with DRS. Close margins however are often accepted in clinical practice and do improve patient outcome. DRS integration should not be considered as a replacement for current margin assessment techniques but rather as a complement. Overall, integration of DRS into electrosurgical instruments seems promising. More research is required to see if DRS can truly perform in the OR.
