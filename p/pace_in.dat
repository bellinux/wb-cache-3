5|$|The {{race was}} preceded by three {{practice}} sessions. Ferrari's Felipe Massa set the <b>pace</b> <b>in</b> {{the first of two}} 90-minute practice sessions on Friday, with a time of 1:34.972, edging out McLaren's Fernando Alonso by three-tenths of a second. Alonso's teammate Hamilton was third, with Ferrari's other driver, Räikkönen, just behind in fourth. Nico Rosberg, Mark Webber, Jarno Trulli, Kazuki Nakajima, Ralf Schumacher, and Robert Kubica rounded out the top ten.|$|E
40|$|Renal {{function}} and systemic hemodynamics were studied during rapid atrial <b>pacing</b> <b>in</b> dogs with complete heart block {{and in control}} dogs with normal atrioventricular conduction. Rapid atrial <b>pacing</b> <b>in</b> dogs with complete heart block produced no significant change in urine flow, sodium excretion, or systemic hemodynamics. In contrast, rapid cardiac <b>pacing</b> <b>in</b> control dogs produced progressive increases in urine flow and sodium excretion {{and a decrease in}} arterial pulse pressure. Plasma antidiuretic hormone levels were not changed significantly by <b>pacing</b> <b>in</b> either group of dogs; likewise, mean atrial type B (volume) receptor discharge rate was not increased by <b>pacing</b> <b>in</b> either group. Rapid sequential atrioventricular <b>pacing</b> <b>in</b> three dogs with complete heart block did produce an increase in urine flow and sodium excretion, but rapid pacing of the atria alone in the same dogs did not cause a diuresis or a natriuresis. In other experiments on dogs with chronic sinoaortic denervation, rapid cardiac pacing caused no significant changes in urine flow or sodium excretion. Hence, the study provided no evidence to support the hypothesis that diuresis during tachy...|$|R

5|$|MiG-3s were {{delivered}} to frontline fighter regiments {{beginning in the}} spring of 1941 and were a handful for pilots accustomed to the lower-performance and docile Polikarpov I-152 and I-153 biplanes and the Polikarpov I-16 monoplane. It remained tricky and demanding to fly even after the extensive improvements made over the MiG-1. Many fighter regiments had not kept <b>pace</b> <b>in</b> training pilots to handle the MiG and the rapid pace of deliveries resulted in many units having more MiGs than trained pilots during the German invasion.

5|$|As Q3 started, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Lewis Hamilton would be unable to take part, suffering from a hybrid system failure in the turbo charger, the same problem that had plagued him in China two weeks earlier. Nico Rosberg went on to secure pole position, even though his last timed lap was compromised by a tyre lockup into turn 13. Sebastian Vettel was closest to Rosberg, but a five-place grid penalty meant that he would start the race from seventh on the grid, moving Valtteri Bottas into the first row. Kimi Räikkönen was fourth fastest, ahead of Massa, Ricciardo, Pérez, Kvyat and Verstappen. After qualifying, Mercedes decided to switch Hamilton's car back to his spare power unit, which had been rebuilt following its failure at the Chinese Grand Prix, thereby avoiding a grid penalty, which they would have incurred if a new power unit would have been installed. Williams were satisfied with their <b>pace</b> <b>in</b> qualifying, praising the advances they made in slow-corner speed.|$|E

Tallon dropped Compton for the third time, off the bowling of Johnston when the batsman was on 73. Lindwall bowled well below his top <b>pace</b> <b>in</b> the morning session and the batsmen slowly accumulated their runs. Bedser was the more defensive of the two Englishmen, and Compton drove Toshack past mid on for a four to register his second century of the series, after 235 minutes of batting. Lindwall then beat Compton in each of his last three overs before lunch, but the Englishman survived. England reached lunch at 323/7 having added 92 runs without losing a wicket. Compton was on 123 and Bedser on 37, having brought up their century partnership. Five minutes were lost in the morning session when a stray dog invaded the playing arena and evaded policemen and a number of Australian fielders who attempted to catch it.|$|E

40|$|One {{will not}} find {{many people in the}} Western world who have not heard, seen or read {{something}} about the famous detective Sherlock Holmes. Since Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s first stories on Sherlock were published in 1887, numerous adaptations have been made of the adventures of the consulting detective and doctor Watson. In 2010 the BBC aired a new adaptation, Sherlock, written by Steven Moffat and directed by Paul McGuigan. They show a modernised version of the Sherlock Holmes stories. While the original stories take place in the Victorian era, the adaptation places Sherlock in the 21 st century. It shows a modern Sherlock Holmes living in contemporary London using modern technology such as mobile phones, laptops and GPS. A variety of articles and papers have been written about the BBC Sherlock adaptation. However, few focus on the <b>pacing</b> <b>in</b> the Sherlock Holmes stories. Yet, one striking difference between the novel and the adaptation is the pacing of the stories. Whereas in the novel the pace shifts, fast paced events are alternated by slower paced parts, the adaptation is fast paced throughout. Therefore, this thesis shall focus on the <b>pacing</b> <b>in</b> Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s first novel on Sherlock Holmes, A Study in Scarlet, compared to the <b>pacing</b> <b>in</b> the BBC series Sherlock “A Study in Pink”, written by Steven Moffat and directed by Paul McGuigan 2010. Due to limited time and space this thesis shall focus on the first episode of Sherlock “A Study in Pink” which lasts 90 minutes and shall be compared to the novel, A Study in Scarlet, which consist of 80 pages and is written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Pacing refers to the speeding up or slowing down of a narrative. However, both in a novel as well as <b>in</b> television, <b>pace</b> is determined by different aspects. Pacing for instance, can be influenced by word choice, sentence structures and descriptive texts while in television also sound and visuals play an important role. Therefore in this thesis the <b>pacing</b> <b>in</b> the novel shall be discussed separately from the pace of the television adaptation before comparing them in the conclusion. Chapter one describes <b>pacing</b> <b>in</b> novels and television. Chapter two focuses on the <b>pacing</b> <b>in</b> Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s first novel, Sherlock Holmes, A Study in Scarlet. The Third chapter shall discuss <b>pacing</b> <b>in</b> the BBC adaptation Sherlock, written by Steven Moffat and directed by Paul McGuigan. Finally, in the conclusion the <b>pacing</b> <b>in</b> the novel {{as well as in the}} television adaptation shall be compared...|$|R
