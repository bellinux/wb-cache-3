5|$|Kubera is the {{treasurer}} of the gods and overlord of the semi-divine Yakshas, the Guhyakas, Kinnaras and Gandharvas, who act as his assistants and protectors of the jewels of the earth, as well as guardians of his city. Kubera is also the guardian of travelers and the giver of wealth to individuals, who <b>please</b> <b>him.</b> The Rakshasas also serve Kubera, however, some cannibalistic Rakshasas are described to have sided with Ravana {{in the battle against}} Kubera. Kubera also developed as minor marriage-divinity. He is invoked with Shiva at weddings and is described as Kameshvara ("Lord of Kama – pleasure, desire etc."). He is associated with fertility of the aquatic type.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Ramanuja {{believes}} that Vishnu wishing to do a favour {{to those who}} are resolved on acting so as fully to <b>please</b> <b>Him,</b> engenders in their minds a tendency towards highly virtuous actions, such as means to attain to Him; while on the other hand, in order to punish those who are resolved on lines of action altogether displeasing to Him, He engenders in their minds a delight in such actions as have a downward tendency and are obstacles {{in the way of the}} attainment of God.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{then had}} the 63rd and 9th Divisions taken away, then (10 October) heard his whole Corps {{was to be}} {{transferred}} to Gough’s Reserve Army, a prospect which did not <b>please</b> <b>him.</b> In October Gough “hauled him over the coals over the state of IV Corps”. By 18 October IV Corps had no divisions at all, and Wilson had to take 2 weeks leave in the UK in early November. Edmonds later wrote that Wilson’s preparations had laid the foundations for the successful capture of Vimy Ridge in April 1917.|$|E
6000|$|I {{tried to}} get him some of those apples, but I cannot learn to throw straight. I failed, but I think the good {{intention}} <b>pleased</b> <b>him.</b> They are forbidden, and he says I shall come to harm; but so I come to harm through <b>pleasing</b> <b>him,</b> why shall I care for that harm? ...|$|R
60|$|She {{took her}} {{responsibilities}} lightly. When she spilled her tea on the pillow, she rubbed it carelessly with a handkerchief, {{and turned over}} the pillow. He would have felt guilty. She did not. And it <b>pleased</b> <b>him.</b> It <b>pleased</b> <b>him</b> very much to see how these things did not matter to her.|$|R
60|$|Good, true face, as {{that face}} of hers was, and {{pleasant}} {{as it had}} been to him, Mr Morfin, the hazel-eyed bachelor, since {{the first time he had}} ever looked upon it, it <b>pleased</b> <b>him</b> less at that moment, lighted with a ray of exultation, than it had ever <b>pleased</b> <b>him</b> before.|$|R
25|$|The Rev. Mr. Leslie, of Castlebellingham, who {{threatened}} the Gaelic league with his wrath for daring {{to hold a}} Feis on Sunday, has, we regret to say, found an imitator in a Catholic clergyman {{at the other side}} of Ireland – the Rev. Father Donor, of Shanagolden. This gentleman acted similarly towards the Gaelic League of Foynes, which proposed to hold its Feis on a Sunday, and to appease him the Feis was held on a week day, with the result that numbers of people were deprived from attending it. Although the Sunday fixture was abandoned to <b>please</b> <b>him,</b> neither Father Donor nor any of his curates attended the Feis.|$|E
25|$|Other {{possible}} {{sources are}} the anonymous play King Leir (published in 1605); The Mirror for Magistrates (1574), by John Higgins; The Malcontent (1604), by John Marston; The London Prodigal (1605); Montaigne's Essays, which were translated into English by John Florio in 1603; An Historical Description of Iland of Britaine (1577), by William Harrison; Remaines Concerning Britaine (1606), by William Camden; Albion's England (1589), by William Warner; and A Declaration of egregious Popish Impostures (1603), by Samuel Harsnett, which provided {{some of the}} language used by Edgar while he feigns madness. King Lear is also a literary variant of a common fairy tale, Love Like Salt, Aarne–Thompson type 923, in which a father rejects his youngest daughter for a statement of her love that does not <b>please</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} series, Baldrick's {{attempts}} {{to raise his}} social status bring much lower results due to his much smaller intelligence. His most visible attempt is in the first episode, where he tries to marry Lord Edmund Blackadder as his bridesmaid (after Kate eloped). Fortunately, Baldrick still has enough intelligence left to admire Blackadder and clearly has desire to <b>please</b> <b>him.</b> Unfortunately, Edmund despises him and even fires him once. This great obstacle was removed {{for a short period}} of time when Edmund was kidnapped by Prince Ludwig the Indestructible along with Lord Melchett, thus Baldrick was able to get into the royal court by becoming the Queen's personal pet. A few hours later he was murdered by Prince Ludwig along with Blackadder, Melchett, Queenie, Nursie, and Lord Percy.|$|E

60|$|Yes, Blacky the Crow {{was very}} much pleased with himself. It looked very much {{as if he would}} succeed in helping Bowser the Hound. This <b>pleased</b> <b>him.</b> But it <b>pleased</b> <b>him</b> still more to know that he was fooling clever Reddy Fox while Reddy thought {{he was the one who}} was doing the fooling.|$|R
500|$|As McCarthy became {{increasingly}} combative towards the Eisenhower Administration, Eisenhower faced repeated calls that he confront McCarthy directly. Eisenhower refused, saying privately [...] "nothing would <b>please</b> <b>him</b> [...] {{more than to}} get the publicity that would be generated by a public repudiation by the President." [...] On several occasions Eisenhower {{is reported to have}} said of McCarthy {{that he did not want}} to [...] "get down in the gutter with that guy." ...|$|E
500|$|His father Ben {{described}} him as a [...] "clumsy" [...] child, whose main interest was playing football: [...] "He used to come down 24 stairs to breakfast bouncing a ball on his head." [...] This {{had an effect on}} his schoolwork; Overmars was uninterested in school, but did pass [...] "a couple of GCEs". Ben did not know whether he made the effort to take his exams just to <b>please</b> <b>him.</b> As a teenager, Overmars did weight-training which improved his speed. He also attributed his pace to his mother who was quick, but [...] "had no time for sports".|$|E
500|$|The Fox Network series House {{represented}} an [...] "asexual" [...] {{couple in the}} episode [...] "Better Half". However, this representation has been questioned {{by members of the}} asexual community (including AVEN founder, David Jay) due to the episode concluding in the reveal that the man simply had a pituitary tumor that reduced his sex drive, and the woman was only pretending to be asexual to <b>please</b> <b>him.</b> This led to controversy over the representation and a change.org petition for Fox Network to reconsider how it represents asexual characters in the future, stating it [...] "represented asexuality very poorly by attributing it to both medical illness and deception." ...|$|E

500|$|The Emperor {{experienced}} an unhappy and solitary childhood. He was considered precocious, docile and obedient, but frequently cried and often {{nothing seemed to}} <b>please</b> <b>him.</b> He [...] "was not raised in luxury and everything was very simple." [...] As his sisters could not accompany him at other times, he only had permission to meet them after lunch, and even then for only one hour. He had few friends of his age, {{and the only one}} he retained into adulthood was Luís Pedreira do Couto Ferraz, future Viscount of Bom Retiro. However, he was treated tenderly by Mariana de Verna and also by Rafael, who played with him by carrying him on his shoulders and who also allowed Pedro II to hide in his room to escape from studies. For the greater part of his time, he was surrounded by servants who only had permission to speak to him when questioned. The environment in which Pedro II was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw in [...] "books another world where he could isolate and protect himself." [...] Behind the [...] "pomp of the monarchy, of the self-sufficient appearance, there must have lived an unhappy man." ...|$|E
500|$|Since the 1940s, Khrushchev had {{advocated}} {{the cultivation of}} corn (maize) in the Soviet Union. He established a corn institute in Ukraine and ordered thousands of acres to be planted with corn in the Virgin Lands. In February 1955, Khrushchev gave a speech in which he advocated an Iowa-style corn belt in the Soviet Union, and a Soviet delegation visited the U.S. state that summer. While their intent was to visit only small farms, the delegation chief was approached by farmer and corn salesman Roswell Garst, who persuaded him to insist on visiting Garst's large farm. The Iowan visited the Soviet Union in September, where he became great friends with Khrushchev, and Garst sold the USSR [...] of seed corn. Garst warned the Soviets to grow the corn {{in the southern part}} of the country, and to ensure there were sufficient stocks of fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides. This, however, was not done, as Khrushchev sought to plant corn even in Siberia, and without the necessary chemicals. While Khrushchev warned against those who [...] "would have us plant the whole planet with corn", he displayed a great passion for corn, so much so that when he visited a Latvian kolkhoz, he stated that some in his audience were probably wondering, [...] "Will Khrushchev say something about corn or won't he?" [...] He did, rebuking the farmers for not planting more corn. The corn experiment was not a great success, and he later wrote that overenthusiastic officials, wanting to <b>please</b> <b>him,</b> had overplanted without laying the proper groundwork, and [...] "as a result corn was discredited as a silage crop—and so was I".|$|E
2500|$|At this time, the Grand Dukes of Tuscany {{employed}} a large staff of about 100 artisans, {{who worked in}} the Galleria dei Lavori of the Uffizi. Cristofori's initial work space was probably in this area, which did not <b>please</b> <b>him.</b> He later told Maffei: ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{is certain}} {{that he was not}} a pupil of Rab, since sayings of Abba Arika which did not <b>please</b> <b>him</b> were criticized by him with a disrespect which he would not have shown toward his own teacher. Concerning many of Rab's sayings, Sheshet {{asserted}} that [...] "he must have spoken thus when he was asleep" [...] (Yeb. 24b and parallels; comp. also Niddah 60a).|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Boito {{began work}} on the {{libretto}} in spite of illness and, by late October/early November had sent {{a copy of the}} work so far. [...] After appealing to Giuseppina, Ricordi was told that the Verdis would be coming to Milan and that he would meet privately with Boito. [...] However, she noted in her letter of 7 November: [...] "Between ourselves, what Boito has so far written of the African seems to <b>please</b> <b>him,</b> and is very well done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite his often {{difficult}} and demanding personality, many actors {{who worked with}} Ford acknowledged that he brought {{out the best in}} them. John Wayne remarked that [...] "Nobody could handle actors and crew like Jack." [...] and Dobe Carey stated that [...] "He had a quality that made everyone almost kill themselves to <b>please</b> <b>him.</b> Upon arriving on the set, you would feel right away that something special was going to happen. You would feel spiritually awakened all of a sudden." [...] Carey credits Ford with the inspiration of Carey's final film, Comanche Stallion (2005).|$|E

2500|$|Later in 1950, Fonda married Susan Blanchard, {{with whom}} he had been having an affair since {{sometime}} in 1948. [...] She was 21 years old, the daughter of Australian-born interior designer Dorothy Hammerstein, and the step-daughter of Oscar Hammerstein II. Together, they adopted a daughter, Amy Fishman (born 1953). They divorced three years later. Blanchard was in awe of Fonda, and she described her role in the marriage as [...] "a geisha", doing everything she could to <b>please</b> <b>him,</b> dealing with and solving problems he would not acknowledge.|$|E
2500|$|In {{three seasons}} with the Bullogs, Chamberlin led the {{franchise}} to three NFL championships and a record of 28-1-4, having outscored opponents by a combined total of 659 to 94. Dave Noble, who played for the 1924 Bulldogs,explained Chamberlin's coaching success as follows: [...] "Guy Chamberlain knows {{as much or more}} football than any other coach in the country. Moreover, he has a faculty for getting the most out of players, not because he is a driver, for he isn't that sort, but because they like him and will do their utmost to <b>please</b> <b>him</b> by playing hard." ...|$|E
2500|$|Laguerre also instituted the {{innovative}} concept of one long {{story at the}} end of every issue, which he called the [...] "bonus piece". These well-written, in-depth articles helped to distinguish Sports Illustrated from other sports publications, and helped launch the careers of such legendary writers as Frank Deford, who in March 2010 wrote of Laguerre, [...] "He smoked cigars and drank Scotch and made the sun move across the heavens ... His genius as an editor was that he made you want to <b>please</b> <b>him,</b> but he wanted you to do that by writing in your own distinct way." ...|$|E
60|$|The Baron de Grost sent a cipher {{dispatch}} to Paris that night, and received an answer which <b>pleased</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
