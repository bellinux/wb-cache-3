A suboptimal performance in vacuum system may result in inferior overall system performance. The performance of vacuum system is practically gauged in terms of time required to achieve the requisite low pressure. This time is referred as <b>pump-down</b> <b>time.</b> Among the number of factors affecting <b>pump-down</b> <b>time</b> important are pressure to be achieved and configuration of the system (length and diameter of tubing used to connect vacuum tank and pump). In this paper theoretical procedure for calculating <b>pump-down</b> <b>time</b> is explained for the given pressure and configuration of the system. These theoretical calculations are compared with the actual observations taken from the system. Graph of evacuation pressure vs time is drawn for theoretical and actual observations and it is analyzed. Index Terms — Vacuum, vacuum pump, <b>pump-down</b> <b>time,</b> performance, conductance, pumping speed. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} the {{movement}} of precursor particles in the unsteady Pulsed-Pressure Chemical Vapour Deposition (PP-CVD) process is developed to study the high conversion efficiencies observed experimentally in this process. Verification of the modelling procedures was conducted through a study of velocity persistence in an equilibrium gas and through Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) simulations of unsteady self-diffusion processes. The model results demonstrate that in the PP-CVD process the arrival time for precursor particles at the deposition surface is {{much less than the}} reactor <b>pump-down</b> <b>time,</b> resulting in high precursor conversion efficiencies. Higher conversion efficiency was found to correlate with smaller size solvent molecules and moderate reactor peak pressure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} ground testing of a scroll pump with a potential of being {{a substitute for the}} current vacuum pump of the Vapor Phase Catalytic Ammonia Reduction (VPCAR). Assessments of the pressure-time, <b>pump-down</b> <b>time,</b> pump power and the pump noise were made for three configurations of the pump the first of which was without the gas ballast, the second with the gas ballast installed but not operating and the third with the gas ballast operating. The tested scroll pump exhibited optimum characteristics given its mass and power requirements. The pump down time required to reach a pressure of 50 Torr ranged from 60 minutes without the ballast to about 120 minutes with the gas ballast operational. The noise emission and the pump power were assessed in this paper as well...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{replacing}} widespread and inexpensive galvanic treatments with suitable vacuum deposition techniques, {{in order to}} eliminate the environmental hazards and their polluting effects, is becoming, in some cases, more tangible. Shorter cleaning cycles, shorter <b>pump-down</b> <b>times,</b> reduced heating times of substrates and higher deposition rates allow the costs of new plasma-assisted processes to become competitive with respect to galvanic ones. Moreover, vacuum treatments offer superior mechanical and optical properties and non-conductive substrates (like glass, ceramics, plastics) can be more easily coated. This work describes the results obtained with Ion Plating Plasma Assisted deposition processes, using thermal sources, to realise special decorative chromatic effects with multilayer interferential thin films. Special attention was dedicated {{to the study of}} mechanical properties of the deposited layers in relation to the energy of condensing particles and bombarding ions, and to the measurement of their chromatic characteristics. Finally, some considerations about the practical applications of the described processes are presented...|$|R
30|$|To deposit the TiO 2 {{nanostructure}} by ALD, Si substrates {{with the}} AAO templates were first placed into a quartz tube reactor with the operating environment maintained at 1.6 × 10 - 1 Torr and 400 °C. The precursors of TiCl 4 and H 2 O, kept separately in a canister at 30 ± 1 °C and 25 ± 1 °C respectively, {{were used as}} Ti and O sources, respectively. Pure Ar gas (99.999 %) {{was used as a}} carrier gas and purge gas. To prepare TiO 2 nanotube arrays, a 300 -cycle deposition parameter was introduced. Each deposition cycle consisted of eight steps, which included TiCl 4 reactant, pump-down; Ar purge, pump-down; H 2 O reactant, pump-down; and Ar purge and <b>pump-down.</b> Typical pulse <b>times</b> for the TiCl 4 and H 2 O precursors were 1 s, and the purge time was 3 s. To remove the residual reactants and by-products efficiently, the pump-down process was added after each step. Then, with mechanical polishing, the TiO 2 film on the top surface of AAO was removed. Finally, the AAO template was selectively removed by a 0.1 wt% sodium hydroxide (aqueous) solution, and TiO 2 nanotube arrays were fabricated on the Si substrate.|$|R
40|$|AbstractElectrospray {{ionization}} (ESI) {{in combination}} with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry provides for mass analysis of biological molecules with unrivaled mass accuracy, resolving power and sensitivity. However, ESI FTICR MS performance with on-line separation techniques such as liquid chromatography (LC) and capillary electrophoresis has to date been limited primarily by pulsed gas assisted accumulation and the incompatibility of the associated <b>pump-down</b> <b>time</b> with the frequent ion beam sampling requirement of on-line chromatographic separation. Here we describe numerous analytical advantages that accrue by trapping ions at high pressure in the first rf-only octupole of a dual octupole ion injection system before ion transfer to the ion trap {{in the center of}} the magnet for high performance mass analysis at low pressure. The new configuration improves the duty cycle for analysis of continuously generated ions, and is thus ideally suited for on-line chromatographic applications. LC/ESI FTICR MS is demonstrated on a mixture of 500 fmol of each of three peptides. Additional improvements include a fivefold increase in signal-to-noise ratio and resolving power compared to prior methods on our instrument...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Diffusion bonding {{has been}} widely used within microlamination {{architectures}} for the fabrication of Micro Energy and Chemical Systems (MECS). MECS are microsystems {{with the ability to}} process bulk amounts of fluid within highly-parallel microchannel arrays capable of accelerated heat and mass transfer. Thus far, diffusion bonding of microchannel arrays is commonly done in a vacuum hot press system. The use of the hot press greatly restricts the production rate due to vacuum <b>pump-down</b> <b>time</b> and heating-up and cooling-down periods. Furthermore, larger substrates are gaining interest in the system design of MECS devices and it is not apparent that uniaxial pressing within a hydraulic vacuum hot press will provide the bonding pressure uniformity necessary for large substrate bonding. This thesis presents a novel fabrication approach for the high-volume thermal bonding of large substrate MECS devices with the use of controlled thermal expansion. A large substrate thermal bonding clamp based on the principle of differential thermal expansion was developed with focus on controlling the bonding pressure magnitude, timing, sensitivity and uniformity...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} {{aiming to}} replace galvanic treatments by vacuum processes {{is based on}} the effort to reduce the production costs and to set-up new decorative effects impossible to be galvanically realised because the use of dielectric materials. This work describes cost effective metal-oxide and oxide-metal-oxide decorative coatings based on the use of titanium as basic material deposited by Ion Plating Plasma Assisted from Reactive Magnetron Sputtering source. A new multilayer protective and decorative structure, based on the use of titanium and titanium oxides is also presented. The protective effect against aggressive environment is obtained by alternating layers of metal and metal-oxide mixture that exhibit good barrier properties because its microstructure. The decorative effect is obtained with a final couple of titanium and titanium dioxide or, on transparent substrates, with a titanium dioxide - titanium -titanium dioxide structure providing different colour effects on the two faces. Cost effectiveness is obtained by reducing dramatically the process requirements and duration, by simplifying the preparation and cleaning phase, reducing the <b>pump-down</b> <b>time</b> and depositing at room temperature. The treatments were realised and characterised on aluminium, stainless steel and glass substrates...|$|E
