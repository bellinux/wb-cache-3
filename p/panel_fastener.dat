This paper describes {{the development of a}} physical model and associated educational materials that demonstrate the seismic behavior of shear walls used in cold-formed steel (CFS) building systems. Existing research has demonstrated that much of the non-linear behavior of the shear walls occurs due to the relative motion between the CFS frame and sheathing, which results in the fasteners progressively damaging the sheathing material. The shake table model consists of a hinged steel frame, a rigid sheathing <b>panel,</b> and <b>fasteners</b> surrounded by rubber bushings to provide sufficient relative motion between the frame and sheathing. The dynamic properties of the system can be varied by changing the number of fasteners, the stiffness of the rubber, and the mass of the model. The model can be excited with whitenoise, to characterize the frequency and damping, or with earthquake ground motions to study the effect of shear wall properties on the seismic response.

40|$|Majority of {{residential}} {{buildings in the}} United States are built of light-frame wood construction. Light frame-wood buildings located in highly seismic areas are designed to adequately resist such forces. The light frame wood shear wall (LFWSW) is a primary component of a wood-frame building to resist the lateral loads. LFWSW are commonly constructed with wood studs and sheathed with structural wood panels (i. e. plywood or OSB). The sheathing is commonly fastened with nails, around the sheathing panel. The shear capacity of the LFWSW is developed through the ductility of the fastener connection to the framing. The fasteners {{around the perimeter of}} the panel provide necessary ductility to dissipate the seismic energy. Typical nail patterns are commonly {{around the perimeter of the}} rectangular wall <b>panel.</b> The <b>fasteners</b> at the corners of the panels experience disproportionate magnitude of stress and fail first.. A new nail pattern is investigated that would engage fasteners more uniformly and thus distributing the load and improving the seismic performance of LFWSW. The proposed new pattern would have fasteners that are typically located at the corners removed and replaced with corner blocks and fasteners that would be located approximately the same distance from the center of rotation of the panel. The investigation consists of testing walls with typical nail patterns as well as walls with strategically placed nail blocks in order to form an octagonal nail pattern, rather than rectangular. Computer generated finite element models will be used to verify physical test data, if time permits...|$|R
40|$|Two driving {{factors in}} {{aircraft}} panel design are structural efficiency {{and response to}} in-service damage. Stitching through the thickness can improve both of these considerations. Combining stitching with a post-buckling design approach can provide additional improvements. The buckling behavior of stitched structure is considered since lighter structures can be achieved if local skin buckling is allowed to occur at less than design ultimate load. Through-the-thickness stitching can suppress delamination between skin and flange, thereby allowing the structure to reliably carry load into the postbuckling range. Hat-stiffened and rod-stiffened panels in which the skin and flanges were stitched together through-the-thickness prior to curing are considered through experiment and analysis. In both types of <b>panels</b> no mechanical <b>fasteners</b> {{were used for the}} assembly. Specimens were loaded to failure in axial compression.

40|$|To {{improve our}} {{understanding}} of localized density effects in wood-based panels on the holding capacities of fasteners commonly used in furniture, a comprehensive study was conducted using static and cyclic tests of withdrawal and head pull-through of screws and staples and lateral resistance of screws in oriented strandboard (OSB), medium density fiberboard (MDF), and particleboard. In this paper, results of cyclic tests are presented and comparisons are made with the static test results reported in Part 1. Similarly to static tests, cyclic test data indicated that density variation in OSB panels {{had a significant effect}} on screw withdrawal, head pull-through, and lateral resistances, but the effects were less evident with staple withdrawal and head pull-through. For particleboard, density variation had a significant effect on screw and staple face withdrawal and head pull-through resistances, but the effects were less pronounced for screw and staple edge withdrawal and screw lateral resis- tances. For MDF, no significant correlations were found, which was likely due to the low density variation in these panels. The data from this study will be useful to the panel industry and furniture manufacturers for optimizing use of <b>panel</b> products and <b>fasteners</b> in furniture frames.

40|$|A timber {{building}} made of cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels is a {{modular system}} where all panels are pre-cut in factory. On site, the single components are then assembled connecting the <b>panels</b> with mechanical <b>fasteners,</b> mainly angle brackets with nails and/or screws, hold-downs, metal plates and self-tapping screws. CLT wall panels are very rigid {{in comparison to}} its connections. Thus, connections play {{an essential role in}} maintaining the integrity of the structure providing the necessary strength, stiffness and ductility, and consequently, they need close attention by designers. However, there is still a lack of proper design rules for these connections, in particular under cyclic loads, mainly due to a large variety of connectors and connection systems. In this paper, the different properties of connections for CLT buildings, on both monotonic and cyclic behaviour, are described using recent works from different authors. From the bibliography, it is clear that experimental data, regarding both monotonic and cyclic tests, is required for the assessment of the performance of the CLT structural system attending to the interaction between rigid panels and connections. This work evidences results from experimental campaigns and numerical analysis regarding definition and quantification of the cyclic response of CLT connections. Examples regarding monotonic and cyclic tests aimed to evaluate cyclic behaviour of connections through physical parameters, such as the impairment of strength and the damping ratio, are presented and discussed.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringLarge {{composite}} structures have been increasingly {{used in the}} aviation industry. In order to achieve higher fuel efficiency, the use of light-weight, high-strength composite materials, such as carbon/epoxy, needs to be fully explored. New applications of composite materials include primary structures such as aircraft fuselages. This study dealt with thermal stresses induced in a composite aircraft fuselage, in which the fuselage skin was made of carbon/epoxy composite and was fastened to aluminum beams. These stresses resulted from the large {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) difference and also the large temperature difference between the time of assembly, which was 75 ºF and the actual flight condition, which was - 65 ºF). This temperature difference of around 140 ºF induced high thermal stresses, not only in the fasteners but also in the aluminum beams and composite panels. The two main objectives of the study are as follows: To investigate the thermally induced stresses in the aluminum beams. To investigate the feasibility of thermally isolating the aluminum beams from the composite fuselage skins. An experimental program was conducted to measure the strains on the top surface of an aluminum beam, which was fastened to the composite panel from thermal loads due to temperature difference and CTE mismatch. An approach was also designed to study the effects of the length of the aluminum beam on stresses. An analytical model was developed to evaluate the fastener load transfer and the thermally induced stress within the fastened aluminum/composite assemblies. Five parameters were used to develop an analytical model to calculate the load transfer between the aluminum/composite hybrid structures: equivalent area of the aluminum beam and composite panel, equivalent temperatures of the aluminum beam and composite <b>panel,</b> and equivalent <b>fastener</b> stiffness were determined using three-dimensional finite element analysis. An attempt has been made to study the effect of fastener diameter, fastener spacing, material of the metallic beam, size of the metallic beam, thickness of the composite panel on the five parameters required to find the load transfer so that a relation could be established for a working engineer to determine these parameters without doing any finite element work. Equations correlating the five parameters with geometric and material properties were provided...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{behaviour}} of diaphragms in multi-storey timber buildings by providing methods for {{the estimation of}} the diaphragm force demand, developing an Equivalent Truss Method {{for the analysis of}} timber diaphragms, and experimentally investigating the effects of displacement incompatibilities between the diaphragm and the lateral load resisting system and developing methods for their mitigation. The need to better understand the behaviour of diaphragms in timber buildings was highlighted by the recent 2010 - 2011 Canterbury Earthquake series, where a number of diaphragms in traditional concrete buildings performed poorly, compromising the lateral load resistance of the structure. Although shortcomings in the estimation of force demand, and in the analysis and design of concrete floor diaphragms have already been partially addressed by other researchers, the behaviour of diaphragms in modern multi-storey timber buildings in general, and in low damage Pres-Lam buildings (consisting of post-tensioned timber members) in particular is still unknown. The recent demand of mid-rise commercial timber buildings of ten storeys and beyond has further highlighted the lack of appropriate methods to analyse timber diaphragms with irregular floor geometries and large spans made of both light timber framing and massive timber panels. Due to the lower stiffness of timber lateral load resisting systems, compared with traditional construction materials, and the addition of in-plane flexible diaphragms, the effect of higher modes on the global dynamic behaviour of a structure becomes more critical. The results from a parametric non-linear time-history analysis on a series of timber frame and wall structures showed increased storey shear and moment demands even for four storey structures when compared to simplistic equivalent static analysis. This effect could successfully be predicted with methods available in literature. The presence of diaphragm flexibility increased diaphragm inter-storey drifts and the peak diaphragm demand in stiff wall structures, but had less influence on the storey shears and moments. Diaphragm force demands proved to be significantly higher than the forces derived from equivalent static analysis, leading to potentially unsafe designs. It is suggested to design all diaphragms for the same peak demand; a simplified approach to estimate these diaphragm forces is proposed for both frame and wall structures. Modern architecture often requires complex floor geometries with long spans leading to stress concentrations, high force demands and potentially large deformations in the diaphragms. There is a lack of guidance and regulation regarding the analysis and design of timber diaphragms and a practical alternative to the simplistic equivalent deep beam analysis or costly finite element modelling is required. An Equivalent Truss Method for the analysis of both light timber framed and massive timber diaphragms is proposed, based on analytical formulations and verified against finite element models. With this method the panel unit shear forces (shear flow) and therefore the fastener demand, chord forces and reaction forces can be evaluated. Because the <b>panel</b> stiffness and <b>fastener</b> stiffness are accounted for, diaphragm deflection, torsional effects and transfer forces can also be assessed. The proposed analysis method is intuitive and can be used with basic analysis software. If required, it can easily be adapted for the use with diaphragms working in the non-linear range. Damage to floor diaphragms resulting from displacement incompatibilities due to frame elongation or out-of plane deformation of walls can compromise the transfer of inertial forces to the lateral load resisting system as well as the stability of other structural elements. Two post-tensioned timber frame structures under quasi-static cyclic and dynamic load, respectively, were tested with different diaphragm panel layouts and connections investigating their ability to accommodate frame elongations. Additionally, a post-tensioned timber wall was loaded under horizontal cyclic loads through two pairs of collector beams. Several different connection details between the wall and the beams were tested, and no damage to the collector beams or connections was observed in any of the tests. To evaluate the increased strength and stiffness due to the wall-beam interaction an analytical procedure is presented. Finally, a timber staircase core was tested under bi-directional loading. Different connection details were used to study the effect of displacement incompatibilities between the orthogonal collector beams. These experiments showed that floor damage due to displacement incompatibilities can be prevented, even with high levels of lateral drift, by the flexibility of well-designed connections and the flexibility of the timber elements. It can be concluded that the flexibility of timber members and the flexibility of their connections {{play a major role in}} the behaviour of timber buildings in general and of diaphragms specifically under seismic loads. The increased flexibility enhances higher mode effects and alters the diaphragm force demand. Simple methods are provided to account for this effect on the storey shear, moment and drift demands as well as the diaphragm force demands. The analysis of light timber framing and massive timber diaphragms can be successfully analysed with an Equivalent Truss Method, which is calibrated by accounting for the <b>panel</b> shear and <b>fastener</b> stiffnesses. Finally, displacement incompatibilities in frame and wall structures can be accommodated by the flexibilities of the diaphragm panels and relative connections. A design recommendations chapter summarizes all findings and allows a designer to estimate diaphragm forces, to analyse the force path in timber diaphragms and to detail the connections to allow for displacement incompatibilities in multi-storey timber buildings...|$|R
40|$|Hot {{structures}} made {{of ceramic}} matrix composites (CMC) for space reentry vehicles {{play a key}} role regarding the feasibility of advanced and reusable future space transportation systems. Thus realization of applicable flight hardware concerning hot primary structures like a nose cap or body flaps and thermal protection systems (TPS) requires system competence w. r. t. sophisticated know how in material processing, manufacturing and qualification of structural components and in all aspects from process control, use of NDI techniques, arc jet and hot structure testing. However, the most important issue to realize hot primary structures for operational space reentry vehicles is validation of materials and design concepts via real flight testing due to limitations of any existing ground based testing facility or validation methodology. So this has been the strategy of DLR since one decade and multiple reentry flight tests with samples and structural components have been performed until now. Coated and uncoated C/C-SiC specimens were integrated into the ablative heat shield of Russian FOTON capsules and they were tested during two missions in 1992 and 1994. Following on, a hot structure experiment called CETEX which principally was a kind of a little nose cap had been developed and tested during the EXPRESS mission in 1995. These three flight tests were the first ones in Europe carried out with such a kind of material and hot structural concept and many lessons were learned w. r. t. material behaviour and structural design performance under the severe environmental conditions of ballistic capsule reentry. Within an ESA program called FESTIP we developed a new design concept for a rigid surface TPS based on CMCs which should be adaptable to the outer side of a cryogenic tank structure of a future SSTO vehicle. Special TPS concept features are (flat) integrally stiffened CMC <b>panels,</b> hot CMC <b>fasteners</b> for outside attachment capability, thermal displacement compensation, sealing and insulation, provision of a purge gap etc. Based on this concept a flight experiment was realized featuring all principal design aspects mentioned before and adding three different anti oxidation coating systems. The experiment again will be integrated into the heat shield of a Russian FOTON capsule and the mission is planned for October 2002. On the longer run we started to follow a new approach based on the idea of using flat panels for a TPS instead of trying to realize continuous shaped surfaces which is todays design. So the vehicles surface will look facetted and various questions w. r. t. design, manufacturing, heat loads at edges, change of the vehicles aerodynamic properties etc. arise. Just now a flight experiment called SHEFEX (SHarp Edge Flight EXperiment) is in the definition phase and flight is scheduled to 2004. The nose cap development for NASAs X- 38 would have been the most ambitious flight experiment until now and our flight hardware was finished and installed successfully to the flight vehicle V 201 in October 2001. However as the X- 38 project has been stopped just now and other publications already described the development of the nose cap system it will not be focused on within this paper. Highlighting the most important technical issues and achievements of the flight experiments performed so far and reporting about ongoing plannings finally will provide a good insight into DLRs past and future development road map w. r. t. CMC hot structures and TPS for space reentry vehicles...|$|R
