2500|$|Therefore, if {{an object}} is placed at a {{distance}} [...] from a <b>positive</b> lens of <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> f, we will find an image distance S2 according to this formula. If a screen is placed {{at a distance}} S2 {{on the opposite side of}} the lens, an image is formed on it.

Therefore in photography: Object height and distance are always real and <b>positive.</b> When the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> is <b>positive</b> the image's height, distance and magnification are real and positive.

40|$|Centuries ago, it was {{recognized}} that the contour of the refracting surface of a conventional lens defines its focusing properties. The bulk of material between the refracting sur-faces has no effect (other than increasing absorption losses) on the optical properties of the lens. In a Fresnel (point focus) lens the bulk of material has been reduced by the extraction {{of a set of}} coaxial annular cylinders of material, as shown in Figure 1. (<b>Positive</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> Fresnel lenses are almost universally plano-convex.) The contour of the curved surface is thus approximated by right circular cylindrical portions, which do not contribute to the lens ’ optical proper-ties, intersected by conical portions called “grooves. ” Near the center of the lens, these inclined surfaces or “grooves” are nearly parallel to the plane face; toward the outer edge, the inclined surfaces become extremely steep, especially fo...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the space-bandwidth product of {{conventional}} " 2 f " Fourier transforming configurations can be increased without bound by increasing the diameter D and <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> fof the lens simultaneously to Docf 3 / 4. This results in spacebandwidth product growth ocf ~/ 2 and accompanying system linear extent growth ocf ~/ 4. These are derived by considering {{the validity of the}} Fresnel approximation, the thin lens approximation, and the effects of aberrations. The spatial Fourier transform can be realized optically in several ways. One of the best known and prototypical schemes involves a <b>positive</b> lens of <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> f sandwiched between two stretches of free space of length feach (fig. 1). This configuration is commonly known as a " 2 f " system. The Fourier transforming property of such a system is derived in many textbooks, for instance ref. [1, pages 124 - 126]. Certain assumptions are employed in the derivation: (i) The Fresnel approximation is valid for propagation over the distance f...|$|R

5000|$|But such simple lenses are not {{telephoto}} lenses, {{no matter}} how extreme the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> - they are known as long-focus lenses. While the optical centre of a simple ("non-telephoto") lens is within the construction, the telephoto lens moves the optical centre {{in front of the}} construction.A telephoto lens works by having the outermost (i.e. light gathering) element of a much shorter <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> than the equivalent long-focus lens and then incorporating a second set of elements close to the film or sensor plane that extend the cone of light so that it appears to have come from a lens of much greater <b>focal</b> <b>length.</b> The basic construction of a telephoto lens consists of front lens elements that, as a group, have a <b>positive</b> focus. The <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> of this group is shorter than the effective <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> of the lens. The converging rays from this group are intercepted by the rear lens group, sometimes called the [...] "telephoto group," [...] which has a negative focus. The simplest telephoto designs could consist of one element in each group, but in practice, more than one element is used in each group to correct for various aberrations. The combination of these two groups produces a lens assembly that is physically shorter than a long-focus lens producing the same image size. This same property is achieved in camera lenses that combine mirrors with lenses. These designs,called catadioptric, 'reflex', or 'mirror' lenses,have a curved mirror as the primary objective with some form of negative lens {{in front of the mirror}} to correct optical aberrations. They also use a curved secondary mirror to relay the image that extends the light cone the same way the negative lens telephoto group does. The mirrors also fold the light path. This makes them much shorter, lighter, and cheaper than an all refractive lens, but at the cost of some optical compromises due to aberrations caused by the central obstruction from the secondary mirror.|$|R
40|$|A {{gradient}} polymer stabilized {{liquid crystal}} (G-PSLC) structure has recently beenproposed for a tunable-focus lens application. A homogeneously-oriented nematic liquid crystal (NLC) cell, doped {{by a few}} percent of photopolymerizable monomer, is initially illuminated by a laser beam with a Gaussian spatial intensity distribution. This induces a spatially inhomogeneous polymer network in the cell. The electro-optical response of this system to a uniform electric field exhibits an inhomogeneous circularly symmetric pattern. The radial distribution of the effective refractive index possesses a maximum {{in the center of}} the beam. This cell acts as a <b>positive</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> lens on the extraordinary polarized light component passing through it. The profile of the refractive index in the plane of the cell can be changed by varying the voltage across the cell. Thus the focal length of the lens changes with voltage. Here we present a numerical approach to our earlier theoretical model. The model describes the dependence of the focal length of the G-PSLC lens on applied voltage. The new feature of the model is that we have used several trial functions for the form of the polymer profile. The director profile in the cell was determined as a function of voltage. The model qualitatively agrees with the experimental data. The results can be applied to develop G-PSLC lenses with no moving parts and permit electro-optical zoomin...|$|E
