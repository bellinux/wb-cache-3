These fluctuations are defined by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The behaviour of the most <b>probable</b> <b>deviation</b> of headway from its optimal value has been studied and phase diagram of the system has been calculated for supercritical and subcritical regimes of jam formation. It {{has been found that}} for the first regime the fluctuations of characteristic acceleration/braking time result in coexistence of free moving and jammed traffic, that is typical for the first-order phase transition, and in appearance of two steady states for the second mode. These states correspond to non-zero values of headway deviation at which the formation of jam and congested traffic are possible. Using phase-plain portraits method the kinetics of the system transitions has been analyzed for different domains of the phase diagram for both regimes. Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures, LaTe...|$|E

40|$|The method {{presented}} in this paper is an extension of the promethee, one of the most known multicriteria outranking methods. This extension consists in a more detailed investigation of the differences existing among the performances of the actions examined, achieved through the notion of ideal and anti-ideal alternative. Hence, the state of strict preference relating various pairs of actions can be differentiated with reference to the extreme performances attained by the alternatives under consideration. The more accurate description of the reality leads to a relatively more reliable ranking of the available solutions and allows the exploitation of the results {{for the construction of a}} cardinal scale, assigning to each action a numerical value between 0 and 1. The quantitative differentiation of the alternatives, thus achieved, gives another dimension of information, which is extremely useful for the decision making process. A comparative study of the two methods shows the greater sensitivity of exprom and its ability to reflect in the quantitative results any <b>probable</b> <b>deviation</b> in the initial data of a problem. This sensitivity is accompanied with a greater stability, due to the smoothing of the discontinuities characterizing most preference functions in promethee. © 1991...|$|E
40|$|A {{real-time}} operation model primarily {{useful for}} daily operation of reservoirs is developed. This model {{is based on}} a chance constraint formulation and assumes a particular form of the linear decision rule. It uses the conditional distribution function (CDF) of actual streamflows conditioned on the forecasted values. These CDF's are constructed by incorporating the statistical properties of forecast errors for different time steps. The objective considered is the minimization of weighted <b>probable</b> <b>deviations</b> from storage and release targets. These weights are surrogates for the actual loss functions, and the <b>probable</b> <b>deviations</b> are functions of the reliability levels specified in the model. With the use of target values for release and storage, this model is capable of using a release policy that is a subset of a seasonal policy and overcomes the myopic (short-sighted) nature of operation. Simulation of actual operation, using this model for a hypothetical reservoir, demonstrates the feasibility and efficiency of this approach. This model is shown to be applicable for a system of reservoirs. The restrictions {{associated with the use of}} a linear decision rule are shown to be invalid for this model...|$|R

40|$|Covariance {{models are}} a {{powerful}} description of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) families {{that can be}} used to search nucleotide databases for new members of these ncRNA families. Currently, estimation of the parameters of a covariance model (state transition and emission scores) is based only on the observed frequencies of mutations, insertions, and deletions in known ncRNA sequences. For families with very few known members, this can result in rather uninformative models where the consensus sequence has a good score and most deviations from consensus have a fairly uniform poor score. It is proposed here to combine the traditional observed-frequency information with known information about free energy changes in RNA helix formation and loop length changes. More thermodynamically <b>probable</b> <b>deviations</b> from the consensus sequence will then be favored in database search. The thermodynamic information may be incorporated into the models as informative priors that depend on neighboring consensus nucleotides and on loop lengths...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{electrical}} {{distribution network}} operation depends considerably on network busloads, which are formed by active and reactive {{power of the}} substations. Therefore, the network operation variables such as power flows, currents, voltages, etc. change similarly as do loads. It is possible to notice periodicity, tem-perature dependency, stochasticity etc. This paper describes the distribution network monitoring methodology based on the mathematical model of load, i. e. in described approach, the network busloads are modeled using the mathematical model of load and afterwards, modeled load values in different conditions are used for network monitoring. Monitoring is understood as network operation forecasting, simulation, and analysis. Success of monitoring is guaranteed by an adequate mathematical model, which describes the changes of the load during the entire observable period, both {{in the past and}} in the future. The results, obtained through network monitoring process could be used for long- and short-term planning and dispatching, considering adequate changes in time, temperature dependency, <b>probable</b> <b>deviations</b> of the state variables etc. Based on the results it is possible to assess network operation and possible future scenarios and their effect on the network and apply appropriate solutions to enhance system reliability and security. An application of network analysis, modelling and estimation but also validation of results with real measurements obtained from real distribution network is presented.

40|$|Short-term {{operation}} {{policy for}} multipurpose reservoirs {{can be derived}} from an optimization model with the objective of minimizing short-term losses (opportunity costs). Construction of such loss functions requires the definition of target values for the decision variables, assessment of reliabilities with which inflows can be predicted, and an explicit statement of operational objectives. Formulation and evaluation of a model is complicated by the uncertainties inherent in the prediction of future streamflows and by controversies about the criteria of evaluation. We discuss these issues and illustrate some of our arguments with simple numerical experiments. A series of synthetic short-term forecasted values (which satisfy a specified distribution of forecast errors) is used to examine operation of a single reservoir. The quality of forecasted values is represented by the mean and variance of these errors or the coefficient of prediction (Cp). The objective function of the operation model is assumed to be the best possible tradeoff between <b>probable</b> <b>deviations</b> from two operation targets: release and storage volume. Reservoir release was effected according to the solution of the optimization model conditioned upon the forecasted streamflow volumes for a given time increment. The storage volume was then corrected to reflect actual streamflow for the forecasted period. This became the initial storage for the next forecast period. Actual losses, deviations between actual and forecasted losses, the variance of storage and release volumes, and operational performance measures, including reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability, were found {{to be sensitive to the}} relative importance given to deviations from release or storage targets and the quality of forecasts. The performance of an operation policy based on a model that uses predicted streamflows as deterministic inputs cannot be correlated directly with the shape of the assumed loss function...|$|R
40|$|The {{uncertainty}} {{existing in}} the construction industry is bigger than in other industries. Consequently, most construction projects do not go totally as planned. The project management plan needs therefore to be adapted repeatedly within the project lifecycle to suit the actual project conditions. Generally, the risks of change in the project management plan are difficult to be identified in advance, especially if these risks are caused by unexpected events such as human errors or changes in the client preferences. The knowledge acquired from different resources is essential to identify the <b>probable</b> <b>deviations</b> as well as to find proper solutions to the faced change risks. Hence, it is necessary to have a knowledge base that contains known solutions for the common exceptional cases that may cause changes in each construction domain. The ongoing research work presented in this paper uses the process modeling technique of Event-driven Process Chains to describe different patterns of structure changes in the schedule networks. This results in several so called “change templates”. Under each template different types of change risk/ response pairs can be categorized and stored in a knowledge base. This knowledge base is described as an ontology model populated with reference construction process data. The implementation of the developed approach can be seen as an iterative scheduling cycle that will be repeated within the project lifecycle as new change risks surface. This can help to check the availability of ready solutions in the knowledge base for the situation at hand. Moreover, if the solution is adopted, CPSP, “Change Project Schedule Plan „a prototype developed {{for the purpose of this}} research work, will be used to make the needed structure changes of the schedule network automatically based on the change template. What-If scenarios can be implemented using the CPSP prototype in the planning phase to study the effect of specific situations without endangering the success of the project objectives. Hence, better designed and more maintainable project schedules can be achieved...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: There {{are many}} studies {{focusing}} on personality disorders {{of the patients}} with epilepsy in developed countries, using different methods. Such investigations with standardised tools like personality questionnaires lack in African populations in general and among the number of epileptic patients who have important psychosocial problems. In Togo, epilepsy still remains a shameful and contagious disease that leads often unfortunately to a "social death". The number of epileptic patients {{in this country is}} estimated around 45, 000 and 90, 000 and the situation is worst in some areas of the country like in Nadoba, chef-lieu of the Tamberma region where lives an homogenous and stable population that has kept its tradition. DESIGN OF THE STUDY: This study was aimed to show the probable existence of specific personality disorder among the epileptics in Nadoba; 34 epileptics and 34 controls chosen among the closest relatives (parents or co-tenants) matched by age (more or less than ten years old) and sex have been interviewed using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) of Cloninger et al., in its French version validated by P?ssolo and L?ne. The TCI is a self addressed questionnaire that has 226 items with dichotomous and forced answer (true or false) that explores 7 dimensions of personality, 4 concerning temperament and 3 concerning character. Regarding psychometric aspects, the TCI has the particularity to gather together, in a unique tool, the exploration of two complementary dimensions: temperament rather conditional and character that has been acquired. The scores of character allow to differentiate the subjects having a good level of adaptation (high scores, about 100 %), from those who, because of an individual fragility, adapt themselves less well (low scores). The temperament profile is used on a second approach to locate the personality disorders, taking into account <b>probable</b> <b>deviations.</b> People participating in this study were also interviewed with the Goldberg anxiety and depression scale. For the statistical analysis, the comparison of means was achieved through bilateral Student't-test. A significance threshold of 0. 05 has been used for the analysis. RESULTS: Concerning the results, 67 questionnaires have been selected from 33 epileptics (3 men and 30 women), mean age 29. 3 years+/- 8. 1 and 34 controls (4 men and 30 women), mean age 30. 6 years+/- 5. 6. The average scores obtained from the different items of the TCI scale are summarised in chart 1. The comparison of average scores obtained at each item, sub-dimension and dimension of the TCI, did not show any significant difference between cases and controls. However cases were significantly different from controls (P< 0. 001) on average Goldberg's anxiety scores (4. 6 +/- 1. 5 and 2. 6 +/- 1. 3) and depression (4. 4 +/- 2. 2 and 0. 8 +/- 0. 8). DISCUSSION: The average scores obtained in France {{in the course of the}} normative study in general population were rather different. The validation study of the French version of TCI showed differences with the population of North America, suggesting inter cultural differences while evaluating the personality and the necessity of using specific norms during each new translation of the instrument. However, the valued in the French-speaking populations (Belgium, Swiss, Lebanon) are in general very close to the French values. The character and behavioural disorders among are of interest and the difficulty in evaluating the part of hysteria in the manifestation of exhibiting pseudo-seizure of epilepsy is also underlined. This question is raised in Nadoba in women, called "Odueri" or "the women that fall", a particular form of tonico-clonic fits observed in that cultural setting. Is it a question of real epileptic seizure or are these phenomena a kind of trance? This investigation of the Tamberma in Togo urges to set up psychometric studies to define local norms. It also suggests the possible existence of personality traits specific to the "women that fall" but these aspects require further developments...|$|R
40|$|A potential-flow {{model for}} {{conceptual}} design and vertical tail sizing purposes, currently under development, {{has been applied}} and tested in {{an investigation of the}} influence of the propeller slipstream on the empennage flowfield. Additionally, the model is intended to increase the understanding of the phenomena arising in propeller–empennage interaction. For verification purposes and complementation to limited wind-tunnel results in open literature, dedicated measurements were performed and supplemented by a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes analysis. From wind-tunnel measurements, in one-engine-inoperative condition, it is found that the empennage experiences a propeller-induced crossflowfield, which is found to be the main contributor to the additional yawing moment experienced by the measured multiengine propeller aircraft. The most <b>probable</b> cause for <b>deviation</b> in yawing moments in measurements and the potential-flow model is incorrect modeling of the flowfield behind the wing. This was verified by a comparison of the measured and computed flowfield behind the wing and in front of the vertical tail. Efforts to create a potential model to aid in conceptual vertical tail sizing should, therefore, focus on achieving realistic wing-wake behavior. In this respect, the effect of the propeller on the wing-lift distribution, as well as the wing-wake aircraft interaction, should be treated with care. Nomenclature b = wing span,...|$|R
40|$|Folates play an {{important}} role in the human metabolism. They are important for the DNA-formation, as well as for the methyl -transfer, especially for the methylation of homocysteine to methionine. The methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), the methionine synthase (MS) and the cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) are the central enzymes of the folate metabolism. Due to certain mutations, polymorphism of these enzymes may appear. The two most important polymorphism of the MTHFR are the C 677 T-polymorphism and the A 1298 C-polymorphism. For the methionine synthase, the A 2756 G-polymorphism is one of the most common. Mutations also appear for the CBS. These mutations may result in an increased requirement for folic acid to maintain the enzymatic activity, an increased homocysteine-level and some diseases or even malformation of the embryo. The nematode C. elegans was first discovered 1900 and from the very be-ginning it was in the focus of research- interest. During the 60 ies it was es-tablished as a model organism. Since then, the interest it gained increased enormously and it will retain its role as {{an important}} research object in the scientific future. Its similarity to the human genome is remarkable.

40|$|Meeting {{short-term}} production targets {{is desired}} by many companies, since this would {{enable them to}} fine tune the processing operation, meet budget plans and obey contract requirements. Recently stochastic optimization solutions have been developed requiring geostatistical simulations as input. The significant value added has been demonstrated, however, an operational implementation of such approaches for day-to-day use is complex and seems currently difficult as it requires expert knowledge and extensive computational capacity. To control the short-term deviations, a new fast metaheuristic scheduler is developed that blends Geological Confidence Classes (GCC’s) from resource reporting standards. For the scheduler, a new penalty function is developed to schedule for a target blend of GCC’s and a new method is developed to enforce smooth mining patterns in three dimensions. The metaheuristic solver uses a Genetic Algorithm and an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to efficiently converge towards the Pareto optimum. To establish an optimal blend of GCC’s, a methodology is developed which creates a range of equally <b>probable</b> scenarios of <b>deviations</b> from production targets for different blends of GCC’s. A least-squares estimate can be fitted to these scenarios at the required level of confidence to determine the optimal blend for a maximum allowed deviation. An historical world class gold deposit is used to show that the monthly and quarterly deviations can be controlled by blending GCC’s. Furthermore, the case study shows the possibility to establish an optimal blend of GCC’s by using the developed methodology. The scheduler proofs to be able to efficiently create and evaluate schedules to blend the GCC’s for this case study. For a maximum quarterly deviation of 15 % at a 90 % confidence level, the established optimal blend is 59 % ore tonnage classified as measured resources. For the monthly deviations, a maximum of 15 % is too low and cannot be met at a 90 % confidence level.

The primary goals of the present study were to establish a Clementine reference map using codominant markers, and to perform comparative mapping of pummelo, sweet orange, and Clementine. Results Five parental genetic maps were established from three segregating populations, which were genotyped with Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) and Insertion-Deletion (Indel) markers. An initial medium density reference map (961 markers for 1084. 1 cM) of the Clementine was established by combining male and female Clementine segregation data. This Clementine map was compared with two pummelo maps and a sweet orange map. The linear order of markers was highly conserved in the different species. However, significant differences in map size were observed, which suggests a variation in the recombination rates.
