This {{formwork}} {{is built}} out of prefabricated modules with a metal frame (usually steel or aluminium) and covered on the application (concrete) side with material having the wanted surface structure (steel, aluminum, timber, etc.). The two major advantages of formwork systems, compared to traditional timber formwork, are speed of construction (modular systems <b>pin,</b> <b>clip,</b> or screw together quickly) and lower life-cycle costs (barring major force, the frame is almost indestructible, while the covering if made of wood; {{may have to be}} replaced after a few - or a few dozen - uses, but if the covering is made with steel or aluminium the form can achieve up to two thousand uses depending on care and the applications).|$|E

Edith Neumann was born Editha Spitzer in Vienna on May 26, 1902, the youngest child of the lawyer and art collector Alfred Spitzer and his wife Hermine. She had an elder sister named Hanna (Hansi). Edith Spitzer studied chemistry and physics at the University of Vienna and received her doctorate in 1927; at that time {{she was the only}} woman studying such subjects there. In 1924 she converted to Christianity, and in May 1925 became engaged to Friedrich (Fritz) Neumann, who was also a Christian convert. In 1938 the couple, fearing the arrest of Friedrich Neumann, fled Vienna via the Danube, finally arriving in London {{with the help of the}} British Society. In 1948 the Neumanns immigrated to the United States, where they settled in New York. Friedrich, now Frederick (Fred) Neumann became the pastor of the Bushwick Congregational Church in Brooklyn, a position he remained at until his death. Edith Neumann worked as a bacteriologist at the Jewish Hospital in Brooklyn, then received a position as microbiologist at Maimonides Hospital, remaining there for the next 20 years. After the death of Frederick Neumann in 1967, Edith Neumann moved to Manhattan and took a job as medical director of the Jetti Katz Clinical Laboratory. In 1982 she retired at the age of eighty. In 1983 she established the Frederick Neumann Memorial Lecture at Princeton Theological Seminary. Edith Neumann donated several paintings from her father's collection to institutions in Vienna. In honor of her donations and work as a scientist, she was given the Austrian Cross of Honor for Science and Art First Class in 1998. Edith Neumann died on June 29, 2002 at the age of 100.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{security}} risk of a commercial aircraft, passengers are not allowed to take certain items in their carry-on baggage. For this reason, human operators are trained to detect prohibited items using a manually controlled baggage screening process. The inspection process, however, is highly complex as hazardous items are very difficult to detect when placed in close packed bags, superimposed by other objects, and/or rotated showing an unrecognizable profile. In this paper, we review certain advances achieved by our research group in this field. Our methodology is based on multiple view analysis, because it can be a powerful tool for examining complex objects in cases in which uncertainty can lead to misinterpretation. In our approach, multiple views (taken from fixed points of view, or using an active vision approach in which the best views are automated selected) are analyzed in the detection of regular objects. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experimental results on recognizing guns, razor blades, <b>pins,</b> <b>clips</b> and springs in baggage inspection are presented achieving around 90 % accuracy. We believe that {{it would be possible to}} design an automated aid in a target detection task using the proposed algorithm. 1...|$|R

It was difficult to disassemble and had many small parts that could be easily lost while cleaning the weapon in the field. Where the M203 broke down into receiver group, barrel group, hand guard group and quadrant sight (the quadrant sight being the smallest piece), the XM148 broke down into barrel, pistol grip, receiver, hand guard, quadrant sight, and several small <b>pins</b> and <b>clips.</b> These issues led the U.S. military to adopt the M203 over the XM148, though the U.S. Air Force did keep a number of the XM148s. In fact U.S. Air Force Security Forces were still being trained on the XM148 in lieu of the M203 as late as 1989. Some security police units still had them in their armories until the 1990s.|$|R

5000|$|Beyond {{the basic}} pin-and-lever mechanism, {{contemporary}} grenades have safety features.

This is particularly important because the safety lever is often used as a carry hook, despite the obvious danger this poses. The bent end of the safety pin increases the force required to remove it, reducing the risk of accidental arming. The 2016 US ET-MP uses a user-settable timed electronic fuze.|$|R
5000|$|For display, {{the piece}} should have {{adequate}} {{support for the}} weight and fragility of the object {{so it is not}} wrinkled or under stress.

40|$|Background: Foreign body (FB) {{ingestion}} is {{a frequent}} gastrointestinal emergency in pediatric population. Improvement in endoscopic techniques and equipment enables nonsurgical management in most situations. Recent data from India on pediatric FB ingestion have been lacking. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the profile and outcome after endoscopic management of patients < 18 years of age presenting with FB ingestion. Patients and Methods: Records of all the children with FB ingestion who had undergone endoscopic removal at our institution during 5 years (2011 – 2016) were assessed retrospectively. The nature of FB ingested, and success and complication of endoscopic therapy were analyzed. Results: There were 150 pediatric endoscopies during the study period. Of this, 120 (80 %) were for removal of ingested FB. Most common (MC) FB was coin (69 %). The retrieved FBs were 83 coins, 13 batteries, 5 <b>pins,</b> 4 <b>clips,</b> 2 each of anklets, keys, marbles, and seeds, one each of spoon, blade, spanner, peanut, toe ring, and a pencil. One had trichobezoar. Esophagus was the MC site of location of FB (85 / 120). FB removal was successful by flexible endoscopy in 97. 1 %. Four (0. 03 %) cases were referred for rigid endoscopic/surgical removal by otolaryngologists/pediatric surgeon. Except for one child developed bronchopneumonia, there was no morbidity or mortality in the study. Conclusion: Endoscopic removal of FB is a safe procedure with excellent outcomes in a specialized gastroenterology unit...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} characteristic is the position of the body in grave pit. Deceased were buried always in north-south alignment, with head south facing east. The body lied in a grave usually in slightly contracted position. Exceptions from this rule are sporadic.In classic phase (approx. 1850-1750 BC), Úněticean burial rite displays strong uniformity, regardless of the gender or age of the deceased. Men and women were buried in the same N-S position. The grave goods consisted of ceramic vessels (usually 1-5), bronze items (jewellery and private belongings, rings, hair <b>clips,</b> <b>pins</b> etc.), bone artifacts (amulets and tools, i.e. needles), occasionally flint tools (e.g. burial of Archer from Nowa Wieś Wrocławska buried with colour flint arrowheads).A body deposited within a grave might have been protected with organic mats or a coffin, but in the majority of cases there was no additional coverage of the corpse. Well known example of wicker-made coffin inhumation derives from Bruszczewo fortified settlement, nearby Poznań in Greater Poland. In approximately 20% of burials, stone settings were found. Erection of a full stone setting or just a partial one (a few stones in the corners of grave) seems to be quite a common practice observed in all phases of the EBA in Central Europe.Wooden coffins were discovered at several sites in e.g. Lower Silesia. The Únětice culture coffin burials can be divided in two types, equipped with: ...|$|R
40|$|Ingestion {{of foreign}} bodies is common {{primarily}} in children, psychiatric patients, alcoholics and elderly {{people who use}} dentures. 1, 2, 3 Selivanov et al. reported that, in most cases of foreign body ingestion, the most common foreign bodies ingested were coins, bones, food debris, safety pins and razor blades. 4 We report {{a case of a}} one year child presenting to us with accidental ingestion of a safety pin. Rarity, technical difficulty in removing the foreign body, complications associated with the delay in diagnosis and treatment, migration of the foreign body extraluminally, site, shape and position of the sharp end of a safety pin makes this case interesting and worth reporting. The case was difficult because the protected end of the safety pin was broken which made both the ends of the foreign body sharp. Also, the ends of the safety pin were wide apart and pointing upwards. Case Presentation A one year old male child presented to the emergency with suspected ingestion of some foreign body four hours back followed by continuous dribbling of saliva, refusal of feeds and incessant cry. Patient was very irritable and unable to take even sips of water. X-Ray neck, chest and upper abdomen. Postero-anterior and lateral views revealed a wide open safety <b>pin,</b> with missing <b>clip,</b> in upper part of neck. Both the sharp ends were pointing upward. X-ray neck, chest and abdomen in a single film was repeated to exclude the presence of the clip of the safety pin inside the body from the nasopharynx to the abdomen.

5000|$|Most {{radio control}} systems have {{traditionally}} used crystals {{to set the}} operating channel in the receiver and transmitter. It is important that each aircraft uses a different channel, otherwise interference could result. For example, {{if a person is}} flying an aircraft on channel 35 (used for 72.490 MHz in North America), and someone else turns their radio on the same channel, the aircraft's control will be compromised and the result is almost always a crash. Since multiple RC frequency use began in the RC hobbies in the mid-20th century, so-called [...] "frequency pins" [...] have been used to ensure that only one modeler was using a particular frequency at any one time, for [...] "traditional" [...] style, crystal-controlled RC system use [...] The common, spring-loaded two-piece wood clothespin - marked in some manner with text and/or color-coding for the designated frequency it references, usually with an added piece of thin plywood or plastic on the clothespin to place the text or color-code upon for greater visibility - is the usual basis for these.

40|$|Herbivore abundances are {{determined}} {{by a set of}} interacting factors that vary among different habitat types. Specifically, herbivore abundances in monocultures and polycultures may be governed by the same set of factors but with varying influences in the different habitats. In addition, monophagous and polyphagous herbivores may respond differently to the same set of influencing factors. I examined several abiotic and biotic factors in manipulated monocultures and polycultures of Borrichia frutescens in a west central Florida salt marsh. The experimental plots differed in both plant diversity and aboveground habitat structure to see how each component of diversity contributed to variability in the abiotic and biotic factors and how those factors were related to differences in herbivore abundances. The monoculture treatment involved clipping all above ground non-host plant material to achieve a host plant monoculture. The polyculture treatments involved pinning all no n-host plant material to achieve a polyculture with reduced above ground habitat structure. The second polyculture treatment was a control in which the naturally diverse plots were unmanipulated. Two monophagous and one polyphagous herbivores were chosen for this study because of their abundance and availability in the field. The two monophagous herbivores on the host plant Borrichia frutescens were Pissonotus quadripustulatus (Homoptera:Delphacidae) and Asphondylia borrichiae (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) both of which have been well studied in the field where the current experiment took place. The polyphagous herbivore was Cyarda acutissima (Homoptera: Flatidae), a poorly known invasive from Cuba. Soil salinity and host plant leaf nitrogen content were the abiotic factors measured. Herbivore abundances, percent egg and gall parasitism by parasitoids, spider abundances on host plant stems and ground spider abundances were the biotic factors measured. Both salinity and host plant lea f nitrogen were significantly different among the different treatments with clipped plots having the highest salinity and leaf nitrogen content. Population densities of both of the monophagous herbivores were not significantly different between treatments. The polyphagous herbivore had significantly higher abundances in the pinned and control plots than in the clipped plots. Stem spider abundances were not significantly different among treatments. Ground spiders, however, were significantly more abundant in control and <b>pinned</b> plots than <b>clipped</b> plots. Parasitism of both monophagous herbivores was not significantly different between treatments but was generally higher in the control plots. The results suggest that for monophagous herbivores bottom-up and top-down factors act antagonistically in monocultures but for the polyphagous herbivore, the presence of multiple host plants is more influential in diverse plots even given the higher abundances of generalist predators...|$|R
