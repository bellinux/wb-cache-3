50|$|The Florida panther is an {{endangered}} population of cougar (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor)</b> {{that lives in}} forests and swamps of southern Florida in the United States. Its current taxonomic status (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi</b> or <b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> couguar) is unresolved, but recent genetic research alone does not alter the legal conservation status.

Common {{among them are}} the pine warbler (Dendroica pinus), the red-bellied woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus), and the eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna). More than 20species of reptiles and amphibians have been noted, such as the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala), and southern black racer (Coluber constrictor priapus). Mammals such as the critically endangered Florida panther (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi),</b> American black bearFlorida black bear (Ursus americanus floridanus), and several types of bats also live in the pine rocklands.|$|R
5|$|The {{plant growth}} around the hammock base is nearly impenetrable; beneath the canopy hammocks {{is an ideal}} habitat for animals. Reptiles (such as various species of snake and anole) and {{amphibians}} (such as the American green tree frog, Hyla cinerea), live in the hardwood hammocks. Birds such as barred owls (Strix varia), woodpeckers, northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), and southern bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nest in hammock trees. Mammal species living in hardwood hammocks include opossums (Didelphis virginiana), raccoons (Procyon lotor), bobcats (Lynx rufus), Everglades minks (Neovison vison), marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and the rare, critically endangered Florida panther (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi).</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{rediscovery of}} remnant Florida panthers (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi)</b> in {{southern}} Florida swamplands prompted {{a program to}} protect and stabilize the population. In 1995, conservation managers translocated eight female pumas (P. c stanleyana) from Texas to increase depleted genetic diversity, improve population numbers, and reverse indications of inbreeding depression. We have assessed the demographic population-genetic, and biomedical consequences of this restoration experiment and show that panther numbers increased threefold, genetic heterozygosity doubled, survival and fitness measures improved, and inbreeding correlates declined significantly. Although these results are encouraging, continued habitat loss, persistent inbreeding, infectious agents, and possible habitat saturation pose new dilemmas. This intensive management program illustrates the challenges of maintaining populations of large predators worldwide...|$|R
40|$|From 2002 through 2005, an {{outbreak}} of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) occurred in Florida panthers (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi).</b> Clinical signs included lymphadenopathy, anemia, septicemia, and weight loss; 5 panthers died. Not associated with FeLV outcome were the genetic heritage of the panthers (pure Florida vs. Texas/Florida crosses) and co-infection with feline immunodeficiency virus. Genetic analysis of panther FeLV, designated FeLV-Pco, determined that the outbreak likely came from 1 cross-species transmission from a domestic cat. The FeLV-Pco virus was {{closely related to the}} domestic cat exogenous FeLV-A subgroup in lacking recombinant segments derived from endogenous FeLV. FeLV-Pco sequences were most similar to the well-characterized FeLV- 945 strain, which is highly virulent and strongly pathogenic in domestic cats because of unique long terminal repeat and envelope sequences.

40|$|A recent {{model of}} Florida panther (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi)</b> habitat erred in {{arbitrarily}} creating buffers around radio locations collected during daylight {{hours on the}} assumption that study animals were only at rest during these times. The buffers generated by this method likely cause an overestimation of the amounts and kinds of habitats that are used by the panther. This, and other errors, could lead to the impression that unfragmented forest cover is unimportant to panther conservation, and could encourage inaccurate characterizations of panther habitat. Previous 24 -hour monitoring of activity and activity readings made during routine telemetry flights indicate that high levels of activity occur in the early morning hours. Literature on the behavior of the species does not support the creation of large buffers around telemetry locations to compensate for the lack of nighttime telemetry data. A thorough examination of ongoing studies that use global positioning systems may help calibrate future Florida panther habitat models...|$|R

50|$|Although the {{long-term}} population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted {{debate on the}} generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi).</b> The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ~ 25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led to {{the reduction in the}} prevalence of the defects previously associated with inbreeding depression. Although the timescale for this inbreeding depression is larger than of those more immediate Allee effects, it has significant implications on {{the long-term}} persistence of a species.|$|R

Variables in our model were Euclidean distance to natural land cover, road density, distance to major roads, human density, amount of natural land cover, amount of semi-natural land cover, amount of permanent or semipermanent flooded area–open water, and a cost–distance variable. We then developed a Florida Panther Habitat Estimator tool, which automates and replicates the GIS processes used to apply the statistical habitat model.

500|$|The most {{critically}} endangered of {{any animal}} in the Everglades region is the Florida panther (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi),</b> a species that once lived throughout the southeastern United States: there were only 25–30 in the wild in 1995.

In the 1990s urban expansion crowded panthers from southwestern Florida as Naples and Ft. Myers began to expand into the western Everglades and Big Cypress Swamp.

40|$|Abstract: Infectious and noninfectious {{diseases}} {{have had}} major impacts on free-ranging wildlife populations, and are especially important when recovering species at risk. For example, disease has hindered {{recovery of the}} black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), Florida panther (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi),</b> pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis), wood bison (Bos bison athabascae), and southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis). Additionally, disease brought the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) {{to the brink of}} extinction in the 1970 s, and caused the extinction of a Partula spp. terrestrial snail in the early 1990 s. When a single disease can extirpate a remnant population, or when managers are forced to use tools such as translocation or captive breeding, which may increase the risk of disease impacts, managers must be proactive about disease risks. We suggest using a multi-tiered process when addressing disease concerns for species at risk: • When planning species recovery, consider disease as a factor that can impact the success of recovery efforts. • Evaluate potentially important infectious and noninfectious diseases. • Be cognizant about the risk of introducing diseases when translocating species or whe...|$|R
40|$|Calf (Bos taurus) {{depredation}} by {{the federally}} endangered Florida panther (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi)</b> on ranches in southwest Florida {{is an important}} issue because ranches represent mixed landscapes that provide habitat critical to panther recovery. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify calf depredation by panthers on two ranches in southwest Florida, and (2) develop a habitat suitability model to evaluate the quality of panther hunting habitat on ranchlands, assess whether the model could predict predation risk to calves, and dis-cuss its potential to be incorporated into an incentive-based compensation program. We ear-tagged 409 calves with VHF transmitters on two ranches during 2011 – 2013 to docu-ment calf mortality.

40|$|Anthropogenic habitat {{degradation}} and loss {{is the single}} largest threat to the endangered Florida panther, <b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi.</b> Conservation of the subspecies must be undertaken {{on the scale of}} the entire landscape. Thus, a view of the forested landscape of South Florida must be developed that is meaningful with reference to the panther. We approach this problem by analyzing the spatial interactions of panthers and forests at multiple scales. We apply tools derived from fractal geometry to the analysis of 12 years of telemetry observations of panthers and remotely sensed forest cover imagery. A fractal characterization extends conventional scale-dependent measures of forest density and relates intuitively to panther ecology. To move toward a panther-centered view of the forests of South Florida, we adopt a scale-dependent notion of association and compare the density of forest cover associated with panther locations to that of the forest at large. Panthers interact with forest cover over a wide range of scales, consistently selecting denser than average forest areas. We discuss landscape-scale management of the panther in light of our findings and propose a protocol for mapping forest cover with reference to the panther at multiple scales as a mangement tool for habitat assessment...|$|R

Between January 1990 and April 2007, the proportion of pumas testing FeLV antibody positive increased, with antibody-positive pumas concentrated in the northern portion of puma range. Five of 131 (4 %) pumas sampled between July 2000 and April 2007 were viremic, with all cases clustered in Okaloacoochee Slough (OKS).

40|$|The Florida panther (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi)</b> is a {{relatively}} well studied species, but some aspects of its habitat requirements remain poorly understood. While it has been well established {{that the most important}} threat to panthers include limited habitat area and continued habitat loss and fragmentation, the importance of roads in this context has not been determined. The goal of this research is to determine the influence of roads on the movement patterns of the Florida panther. Panther telemetry data from 1981 until 2003 was used, as well as detailed road networks and vegetation maps. The influence of roads on individual panthers was determined through an analysis of: 1) vehicular mortality; 2) road crossing behavior; 3) road barrier effects; and 4) effectiveness of preventative measures. Results indicate that vehicle collisions continue to be a major threat to the Florida panther population, specifically adult males. Major roads form more of a barrier to movement than minor roads, but females are affected more than males. The combination of wildlife underpasses and high right-of-way fencing on I- 75 has been extremely effective at vehicular mortality prevention, but the roadway remains a major barrier, particularly for female panthers. This has essentially segregated the movement of the sexes and has fragmented not only the limited habitat of the Florida panther, but also segments of the adult population critical to the propagation of the species...|$|R
40|$|Estimates of {{survival}} {{for the young}} of a species are critical for population models. These models can often be improved by determining the effects of management actions and population abundance on this demographic parameter. We used multiple sources of data collected during 1982 – 2008 and a live-recapture dead-recovery modeling framework to estimate and model survival of Florida panther (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi)</b> kittens (age 0 – 1 year). Overall, annual survival of Florida panther kittens was 0. 323 ± 0. 071 (SE), which was lower than estimates used in previous population models. In 1995, female pumas from Texas (P. c. stanleyana) were released into occupied panther range {{as part of an}} intentional introgression program to restore genetic variability. We found that kitten survival generally increased with degree of admixture: F 1 admixed and backcrossed to Texas kittens survived better than canonical Florida panther and backcrossed to canonical kittens. Average heterozygosity positively influenced kitten and older panther survival, whereas index of panther abundance negatively influenced kitten survival. Our results provide strong evidence for the positive population-level impact of genetic introgression on Florida panthers. Our approach to integrate data from multiple sources was effective at improving robustness as well as precision of estimates of Florida panther kitten survival, and can be useful in estimating vital rates for other elusive species with sparse data...|$|R
40|$|Background: Global {{positioning}} system (GPS) technology for monitoring home range and movements of wildlife {{has resulted in}} prohibitively large sample sizes of locations for traditional estimators of home range. We used areaunder- the-curve to explore the fit of 8 estimators of home range to data collected with both GPS and concurrent very high frequency (VHF) technology on a terrestrial mammal, the Florida panther <b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi,</b> to evaluate recently developed and traditional estimators. Results: Area-under-the-curve was the highest for Florida panthers equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) technology compared to VHF technology. For our study animal, estimators of home range that incorporated a temporal component to estimation performed better than traditional first- and second-generation estimators. Conclusions: Comparisons of fit of home range contours with locations collected would suggest that use of VHF technology is not as accurate as GPS technology to estimate size of home range for large mammals. Estimators of home range collected with GPS technology performed better than those estimated with VHF technology regardless of estimator used. Furthermore, estimators that incorporate a temporal component (third-generation estimators) {{appeared to be the}} most reliable regardless of whether kernel-based or Brownian bridge-based algorithms were used and in comparison to first- and second-generation estimators.

40|$|Genetic {{introgression}} {{has been}} suggested as a management tool for mitigating detrimental effects of inbreeding depression, but the role of introgression in species conservation has been controversial, partly because population-level impacts of genetic introgressions are not well understood. Concerns about potential inbreeding depression in the endangered Florida panther (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi)</b> led {{to the release of}} eight female Texas pumas (P. c. stanleyana) into the Florida panther population in 1995. We used long-term reproductive data (1995 – 2008) collected from 61 female Florida panthers to estimate and model reproduction probability (probability of producing a litter) and litter size, and to investigate the influence of intentional genetic introgression on these parameters. Overall, 6 -month probability of reproduction (± 1 SE) was 0. 232 ± 0. 021 and average litter size was 2. 60 ± 0. 09. Although F 1 admixed females had a lower reproduction probability than females with other ancestries, this was most likely because kittens born to F 1 females survive better; consequently, these females are unavailable for breeding until kittens are independent. There was no evidence for the effect of ancestry on litter size or of heterozygosity on probability of reproduction or litter size. In contrast, earlier studies have shown that genetic introgression positively affected Florida panther survival. Our results, along with those of earlier studies, clearly suggest that genetic introgression can have differential effects on components of fitness and highlight the importance of examining multiple demographic parameters when evaluating the effects of management actions...|$|R
40|$|Decisions {{regarding}} landscape management, restoration, {{and land}} acquisition typically depend on land managers’ interpretation of how wildlife selects habitat. Such assessments {{are particularly important}} for umbrella species like the endangered Florida panther (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi),</b> whose survival requires vast wildlands. Some interpretations of habitat selection by panthers {{have been criticized for}} using only morning locations in defining habitat use. We assessed habitat selection using a Euclidean distance analysis (EDA) and location data collected throughout the diel period from GPS collars deployed on 20 independent Florida panthers. We corroborated aspects of earlier analyses by demonstrating selection of forested habitats by panthers. We also confirmed selection of open habitats (i. e., marsh–shrub–swamps, prairie–grasslands), a novel result. Habitat selection did not vary by sex or season but varied by time of day. Panthers were located closer to wetland forests in the daytime and used prairie–grasslands more at night. Our assessment of the effect of patch size on selection of forest habitat revealed that panthers were not solely reliant on large patches (3 ̆e 500 ha) but utilized patches of all sizes (≤ 1 ha, 3 ̆e 5 – 10 ha, 3 ̆e 1000 ha, etc.). Our results emphasize the importance of collecting panther location data throughout the diel period when assessing habitat selection. Conservation strategies for panthers should consider a mosaic of habitats, a methodology that will protect other sensitive flora and fauna in South Florida...|$|R
40|$|The only {{assumption}} of kernel density estimation, {{the most popular}} method of animal home range delineation, is that sample points used to approximate the utilization distribution are independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.), or what is termed ‘homogeneous’ or ‘stationary’. This research evaluated the accuracy of several home range estimators for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous point patterns of animal tracking data. A novel technique was developed to simulate home ranges from an extensive database of observed Florida panther (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi)</b> locations. Thirty-five homogeneous and inhomogeneous point distributions, each, were generated and used to delineate known home ranges for individual animals. Random samples of 100, 250, 500, and 1000 points from each simulated distribution were {{used to evaluate the}} accuracy of fixed and adaptive kernel density estimation (KDE), local nearest neighbor convex hull (k-LoCoH), and characteristic hull polygon (CHP) methods for delineating home ranges. Both fixed and adaptive KDE overestimated home ranges by up to 30 % for homogeneous samples and underestimated areas by about 50 % for inhomogeneous ones. The k-LoCoH method performed relatively better than KDE, tending to produce slight underestimates of home range sizes, but its performance was widely affected by both homogeneity and sample size. The CHP method produced relatively unbiased estimates of home range sizes for both types of samples, with results fairly robust to sample size. These findings demonstrate the influence of inhomogeneity or nonstationarity in animal locational data on the accuracy of home range estimation methods and suggest that ecologists should consider multiple underlying statistical assumptions when selecting a home range estimator...|$|R
40|$|We have {{estimated}} {{the extent of}} genetic variation in museum (1890 s) and contemporary (1980 s) samples of Florida panthers <b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi</b> for both nuclear loci and mtDNA. The microsatellite heterozygosity in the contemporary sample was only 0. 325 that in the museum samples although our sample size and number of loci are limited. Support for this estimate is provided by a sample of 84 microsatellite loci in contemporary Florida panthers and Idaho <b>pumas</b> <b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> hippolestes in which the contemporary Florida panther sample had only 0. 442 the heterozygosity of Idaho pumas. The estimated diversities in mtDNA in the museum and contemporary samples were 0. 600 and 0. 000, respectively. Using a population genetics approach, we {{have estimated}} that to reduce either the microsatellite heterozygosity or the mtDNA diversity this much (in a period of c. 80 years during the 20 th century when the numbers {{were thought to be}} low) that a very small bottleneck size of c. 2 for several generations and a small effective population size in other generations is necessary. Using demographic data from Yellowstone pumas, we estimated the ratio of effective to census population size to be 0. 315. Using this ratio, the census population size in the Florida panthers necessary to explain the loss of microsatellite variation was c. 41 for the non-bottleneck generations and 6. 2 for the two bottleneck generations. These low bottleneck population sizes and the concomitant reduced effectiveness of selection are probably responsible for the high frequency of several detrimental traits in Florida panthers, namely undescended testicles and poor sperm quality. The recent intensive monitoring {{both before and after the}} introduction of Texas pumas in 1995 will make the recovery and genetic restoration of Florida panthers a classic study of an endangered species. Our estimates of the bottleneck size responsible for the loss of genetic variation in the Florida panther completes an unknown aspect of this account...|$|R
40|$|Summary 1.  Inbreeding and low genetic {{diversity}} can cause reductions in individual fitness and increase extinction risk in animal populations. Intentional introgression, achieved by releasing genetically diverse individuals into inbred populations, {{has been used}} as a conservation tool to improve demographic performance in endangered populations. 2.  By the 1980 s, Florida panthers (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi)</b> had been reduced to a small, inbred population that appeared to be on the brink of extinction. In 1995, female pumas from Texas (P. c. stanleyana) were released in occupied panther range as part of an intentional introgression programme to restore genetic variability and improve demographic performance of panthers. 3.  We used 25 years (1981 – 2006) of continuous radiotelemetry and genetic data to estimate and model subadult and adult panther survival and cause-specific mortality to provide rigorous sex and age class-specific survival estimates and evaluate the effect of the introgression programme on these parameters. 4.  Genetic ancestry influenced annual survival of subadults and adults after introgression, as F 1 generation admixed panthers (ŝ = 0 · 98) survived better than pre-introgression type panthers (ŝ = 0 · 77) and other admixed individuals (ŝ = 0 · 82). Furthermore, heterozygosity was higher for admixed panthers relative to pre-introgression type panthers and positively influenced survival. 5.  Our results are consistent with hybrid vigour; however, extrinsic factors such as low density of males in some areas of panther range may also have contributed to higher survival of F 1 panthers. Regardless, improved survival of F 1 subadults and adults likely contributed to the numerical increase in panthers following introgression, and our results indicate that intentional admixture, achieved here by releasing individuals from another population, appears to have been successful in improving demographic performance in this highly endangered population...|$|R

40|$|The {{endangered}} Florida panther (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>coryi)</b> survives {{in an area}} of pronounced habitat {{diversity in}} southern Florida, occupying extensive home ranges that encompass a mosaic of habitats. Twenty-one years of daytime monitoring via radiotelemetry have provided substantial but incomplete information about panther ecology, mainly because this method fails to capture movement and habitat use between dusk and dawn, when panthers are most active. Broad characterizations of panther habitat suitability have nonetheless been derived from telemetry-based habitat selection studies, focusing narrowly on forests where daytime resting sites are often located. The resulting forest-centered view of panthers attributed their restricted distribution and absence of population growth in the mid- 1990 s to a scarcity of unfragmented forest for expansion. However, the panther population has doubled since the beginning of genetic restoration in 1995, increasing five-fold in public areas described as unsuitable based on forest criteria. Although the forest-centered view no longer explains panther distribution, it continues to shape management decisions and habitat conservation policies. The assumptions and limitations of this view therefore merit critical examination. We analyze the role of forests in the ecology of the Florida panther. To address the absence of nighttime telemetry data, we use innovative telemetry mapping techniques and incorporate information from field observations indicating habitat use during active hours (e. g., tracks, scats, urine markers, and kill sites). We consider daytime telemetry data in the context of panther home ranges and breeding units. We analyze home range size in relation to the amount of forest within each range, concluding that percent forest cover is a poor predictor of size. We apply fractal analysis techniques to characterize the relative density of forest cover associated with daytime locations and interpret the results in terms of spatial landscape patterns, highlighting the limitations of daytime telemetry data for characterizing overall habitat use. We conclude that the forest-centered view of panther habitat selection is based on an uncritical evaluation of telemetry data collected prior to the recent population expansion and on the unsupported assumption that day bed habitats are representative of nighttime habitat use. We find that numerous factors contribute to habitat suitability and population density and distribution, and that P. concolor in Florida, as elsewhere in their range, are habitat generalists, exploiting the broad spectrum of available habitats for hunting, resting, mating, travel, denning, and dispersal. Whereas panthers readily use forested habitat with understory and prey, we find no support for the view that only the forested land within a habitat mosaic is potential panther habitat, or for the contention that only forested habitats are used by panthers within existing home ranges. We suggest a more ecologically consistent management and recovery paradigm based on maintaining the integrity of the system of overlapping home ranges that characterizes panther social structure and satisfies breeding requirements. Such a paradigm focuses on the requirements for reproductive success of a small population in a changing environment...|$|R
