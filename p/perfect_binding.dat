2500|$|<b>Perfect</b> <b>binding</b> {{is often}} used and gives a result similar to {{paperback}} books. National Geographic {{is one example of}} this type. Paperback or soft-cover books are also normally bound using <b>perfect</b> <b>binding.</b> They usually consist of various sections with a cover made from heavier paper, glued together at the spine with a strong glue. The sections are milled in the back and notches are applied into the spine to allow hot glue to penetrate into the spine of the book. The other three sides are then face-trimmed. This is what allows the magazine or paperback book to be opened. Mass-market paperbacks (pulp paperbacks) are small (16mo size), cheaply made with each sheet fully cut and glued at the spine; these are likely to fall apart or lose sheets after much handling or several years. Trade paperbacks are more sturdily made, with traditional gatherings or sections of bifolios, usually larger, and more expensive. [...] The difference between the two can usually easily be seen by looking for the sections in the top or bottom sides of the book.|$|E

The functional is aimed at giving an accurate xc-energy and an accurate corresponding xc-potential even in difficult near-degeneracy situations such as molecular bond breaking. In particular we demand that: (1) the xc hole properly contains - 1 electron, (2) the xc-potential has the asymptotic - 1 /r behavior outside finite systems and (3) the xc-potential has the correct step structure related to the derivative discontinuities of the xc-energy functional. None of the currently existing functionals satisfies all these requirements.

40|$|One {{possible}} explanation for the substantial organismal differences between humans and chimpanzees is that there have been changes in gene regulation. Given what is known about transcription factor binding sites, this motivates the following probability question: given a 1000 nucleotide region in our genome, {{how long does it take}} for a specified six to nine letter word to appear in that region in some individual? Stone and Wray (2001) computed 5, 950 years as the answer for six letter words. Here, we will show that for words of length 6, the average waiting time is 100, 000 years while for words of length 8, the waiting time has mean 375, 000 years when there is a 7 out of 8 letter match in the population consensus sequence (an event of probability roughly 5 / 16) and has mean 650 million years when there is not. Fortunately, in biological reality, the match to the target word does not have to be <b>perfect</b> for <b>binding</b> to occur. If we model this by saying that a 7 out of 8 letter match is good enough, the mean reduces to about 60, 000 years...|$|R
2500|$|In resting cells, axin {{molecules}} oligomerize {{with each}} other through their C-terminal DIX domains, which have two binding interfaces. Thus they can build linear oligomers or even polymers inside the cytoplasm of cells. DIX domains are unique: the only other protein known to have a DIX domain is Dishevelled. (The single Dsh protein of Drosophila corresponds to three paralogous genes, Dvl1, Dvl2 and Dvl3 in mammals.) Dsh associates with the cytoplasmic regions of Frizzled receptors with its PDZ and DEP domains. When a Wnt molecule binds to Frizzled, it induces a poorly known cascade of events, that result in the exposure of dishevelled's DIX domain {{and the creation of}} a <b>perfect</b> <b>binding</b> site for axin. Axin is then titrated away from its oligomeric assemblies – the β-catenin destruction complex – by Dsh. Once bound to the receptor complex, axin will be rendered incompetent for β-catenin binding and GSK3 activity. Importantly, the cytoplasmic segments of the Frizzled-associated LRP5 and LRP6 proteins contain GSK3 pseudo-substrate sequences (Pro-Pro-Pro-Ser-Pro-x-Ser), appropriately [...] "primed" [...] (pre-phosphorylated) by CKI, as if it were a true substrate of GSK3. These false target sites greatly inhibit GSK3 activity in a competitive manner. [...] This way receptor-bound axin will abolish mediating the phosphorylation of β-catenin. Since beta-catenin is no longer marked for destruction, but continues to be produced, its concentration will increase. Once β-catenin levels rise high enough to saturate all binding sites in the cytoplasm, it will also translocate into the nucleus. Upon engaging the transcription factors LEF1, TCF1, TCF2 or TCF3, β-catenin forces them to disengage their previous partners: Groucho proteins. Unlike Groucho, that recruit transcriptional repressors (e.g. histone-lysine methyltransferases), beta-catenin will bind transcriptional activators, switching on target genes.|$|E

40|$|Nrarp encodes for an {{evolutionarily}} conserved small ankyrin repeat-containing {{protein that}} {{functions as a}} negative regulator of Notch signaling. Interestingly, increased Nrarp transcription was observed following induction of Notch signaling, suggesting {{the existence of a}} negative feedback loop. We show here that both mouse and human promoter regions of Nrarp share two conserved regions located approximately 2 and approximately 3 kb upstream of the transcription start site each containing a <b>perfect</b> putative <b>binding</b> site for the Notch-dependent transcription factor Su(H). A 4. 4 kb genomic fragment of the mouse Nrarp locus containing those conserved regions and fused to a luciferase reporter gene showed basal promoter activity in 293 T cells and this activity was strongly increased by the intracellular domain of Notch, NICD. NICD-dependent stimulation was attenuated by a dominant negative mutant of Su(H), Su(H) DBM, and was not observed in Su(H) -deficient cells (OT- 11). Promoter bashing and gel shift assays revealed that the most distal putative Su(H) binding site located within the - 3 kb conserved element plays a crucial role in this induction.

Intergenic and intragenic resolution constraints were determined by an oligonucleotide (70 -mer) microarray approach. Complete signal separation was achieved when comparing unrelated genes within the nitrogen cycle (amoA, nifH, nirK, and nirS) and detecting different variants of the same gene, nirK, corresponding to organisms with two different physiological modes, ammonia oxidizers and denitrifying halobenzoate degraders. The limits of intragenic resolution were investigated with a microarray containing 64 nirS sequences comprising 14 cultured organisms and 50 clones obtained from the Choptank River in Maryland.

40|$|Background: There is {{increasing}} realization that regulation of genes is done partly at the RNA level by sense-antisense binding. Studies typically {{concentrate on the}} role of non-coding RNAs in regulating coding RNA. But the majority of transcripts in a cell are likely to be coding. Is it possible that coding RNA might regulate other coding RNA by short <b>perfect</b> sense-antisense <b>binding?</b> Here we compare all well-described human protein coding mRNAs against all others to identify sites 15 - 25 bp long that could potentially perfectly match sense-antisense. Results: From 24, 968 protein coding mRNA RefSeq sequences, none failed to find at least one match in the transcriptome. By randomizations generating artificial transcripts matched for G+C content and length, we found that there are more such trans short sense-antisense pairs than expected. Several further features are consistent with functionality of some of the putative matches. First, transcripts with more potential partners have lower expression levels, and the pair density of tissue specific genes is significantly higher than that of housekeeping genes. Further, the single nucleotide polymorphism density is lower in short pairing regions than it is in flanking regions. We found no evidence that the sense-antisense pairing regions are associated with small RNAs derived from the protein coding genes. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with the possibility of common short perfect senseantisense pairing between transcripts of protein coding genes...|$|R

40|$|Actin-fragmin kinase (AFK) from Physarum polycephalum {{specifically}} phosphorylates actin in the EGTA-resistant 1 : 1 actin-fragmin complex. The cDNA deduced {{amino acid}} sequence reveals two major domains of approximately 35 kDa each that are separated by a hinge-like proline/serine-rich segment of 50 residues. Whereas the N-terminal domain does not show any significant similarity to protein sequences from databases, there are six complete kelch repeats in the protein that comprise almost the entire C-terminal half of the molecule. To prove the intrinsic phosphorylation activity of AFK, full-length or partial cDNA fragments were expressed both in a reticulocyte lysate and in Escherichia coli. In both expression systems, we obtained specific actin phosphorylation and located the catalytic domain in the N-terminal half. Interestingly, this region did not contain any of the known protein kinase consensus sequences. The only known sequence motif present {{that could have been}} involved in nucleotide binding was a nearly <b>perfect</b> phosphate <b>binding</b> loop (P-loop).

40|$|AbstractWe {{identified}} a new hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF 3) binding {{site in the}} DHBV enhancer. This site {{is close to the}} hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF 1) binding site, responsible for most of the enhancing activity. No differences in the migrating properties were found between this new site and the two other HNF 3 sites recently described in this enhancer. Factor HNF 1 strongly inhibits binding of the HNF 3 factor in this newly characterized site. The two factors were never detected simultaneously on the DNA fragment, even when their respective concentrations were modified. Competition persisted after enlarging by 5 and 10 nucleotides the space between the two sites. On the contrary, when the HNF 3 binding site was changed into the <b>perfect</b> consensus site, <b>binding</b> of the HNF 3 factor was not inhibited any longer by HNF 1 and a supershift, corresponding to the binding of both factors, was observed.

Homeodomain proteins are transcription factors that direct proper development by regulating specific temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression. We therefore addressed {{the role of the}} homeodomain binding motif in the activity of the OC promoter. In this study, by the combined application of mutagenesis and site-specific protein recognition analysis, we examined interactions of ROS 17 / 2. 8 osteosarcoma cell nuclear proteins and purified Msx- 1 homeodomain protein with the OC box. We detected a series of related specific protein-DNA interactions, a subset of which were inhibited by antibodies directed against the Msx- 1 homeodomain but which also recognize the Msx- 2 homeodomain. Our results show that the sequence requirements for binding the Msx- 1 or Msx- 2 homeodomain closely parallel those necessary for osteocalcin gene promoter activity in vivo. This functional relationship was demonstrated by transient expression in ROS 17 / 2. 8 osteosarcoma cells of a series of osteocalcin promoter (nt - 1097 to + 24) -reporter gene constructs containing mutations within and flanking the homeodomain binding site of the OC box. Northern blot analysis of several bone-related cell types showed that all of the cells expressed msx- 1, whereas msx- 2 expression was restricted to cells transcribing osteocalcin. Taken together, our results suggest a role for Msx- 1 and - 2 or related homeodomain proteins in transcription of the osteocalcin gene...|$|R

30|$|Although HR is an {{important}} DNA repair mechanism that protects genome integrity, {{it also has the}} ability to threaten the genome and cause cancer or cell death. As described above a key feature of HR is that it can use any homologous DNA sequences in the genome as substrate. Use of the homologous chromosome instead of the sister chromatid in diploid organisms can potentially lead to loss of heterozygosity [50]. Faulty recombination can result in translocation events as well as expansion and contraction of tandem arrays demonstrating the need for the tight regulation of recombination [27]. Interestingly, it is precisely the ability to promote genome rearrangements that is used in some situations to beneficial effect, raising the question as to how cells have evolved the mandatory controls to grant beneficial rearrangements but at the same time inhibiting those that would be harmful [51]. Since HR is limited to S and G 2 phases, its regulation is linked to the cell cycle apparatus. DSB formation during late S-phase or G 2 phase initiates a DNA damage checkpoint that forestalls cells from progressing through mitosis until DNA is repaired [52]. Additionally, as stated earlier, whether DSBs are ‘clean’ or ‘dirty’ can influence both the pathway used to repair a DSB, and the kinetics of repair. The commitment to HR is established after the CDK 1 -dependent DSB resection [53, 54]. CDK 1 -dependent phosphorylation of CtIP is crucial for its recruitment to the break site where it activates the Mre 11 nuclease [55, 56]. In the absence of phosphorylated CtIP, NHEJ is the preferred pathway for DSBR because the unresected DSBs act as <b>perfect</b> substrates for <b>binding</b> of Ku proteins that initiate NHEJ [53].|$|R

In situations of such grave emergency, when all attempts to peacefully resolve the conflict fail, the determination implicated in the post-World War II maxim “never again” typically falls short, as yet more millions of innocent victims are murdered for ideological or political lies. When there is not a lack of moral conviction, a determined nation might still find themselves entangled in a web of norms of international law that preclude a military force from enforcing universal human rights. Finding this situation to be not only morally intolerable but logically inconsistent with standards and values averred by international society, I set out in my honors project to present a re-conceptualization of the moral and legal framework of intervention. Using Kant’s theory of justice, it will first be argued that protecting universally-established human rights constitutes a <b>perfect</b> duty—both a <b>binding</b> and enforceable obligation. Without a common notion of our responsibilities as both individuals and nations, garnering support for such risky endeavors will hardly be possible. Second, the legal right of an outside force to intervene, when deemed the only possible mechanism to end such an atrocity, must be established. Despite breaching the jus cogens of international law, typically understood, I attempt to show that interventions, in the context of canonical agreements and conventions, can be recognized not only as acceptable but mandatory on the part of the international community. While not proposing a cosmopolitan utopia, I intend to convey the truth in the sentiment expressed by Pratap Mehta that “there is no such thing as a ‘humanitarian crisis’ happening elsewhere. ...|$|R

40|$|Since book {{acquisition}} {{funds have}} become more scarce, libraries are unable to pay higher prices for hard cover books that often circulate {{the same number of}} times as less expensive paper back books. Therefore, {{to increase the number of}} circulations libraries must send books to be either prebound or rebound. A national survey by the American Library Association (ALA) shows that the average trade book might last only 20 to 25 circulations, but books prebound or rebound according to the LBI standard will last at least 100 circulations. The librarian will have to choose whether to replace deteriorated trade books with new ones in order to achieve the same number of circulations as prebound or rebound books. This study concentrates on investigating and determining a cost effective model for rebinding or prebinding books according to specifications of the Library Binding Institute. First, the number of circulations of a rebound and prebound book of a certain price was obtained. The purpose was to set a data base and establish a relation between a cost-effective number of circulations and price of the books plus the cost of rebinding or prebinding. Second, the breakeven number of circulations was determined. In addition, other variables were included such as: thickness; dimension (trim size); type of <b>binding,</b> <b>perfect</b> bound or sewn; the type of cover, hard or paper back editions. The purpose was to provide the librarian with a graph that will aid them in their decision as to whether or not to rebind. This research may also aid in the decision to purchase prebound books. Third, the savings from choosing to rebind or prebind as compared to replacing deteriorated books, were also determined. Finally, a pareto analysis was conducted to identify the most common causes of deterioration of a book. The results showed that the number of circulations was affected strongly by such factors as: ways in which books are handled by users; usage of the books inside the library; photocopying of books; various standards used by libraries to determine when a book should be sent to rebinding; and inadequate storage of books on shelves. Furthermore, two graphs were made to aid the librarian in deciding whether to rebind, to prebind or to keep the book with its original binding. Both graphs, one for hard cover books and one for paper back books, indicate there will be an increase in the cost effective number of circulations as the original purchasing price increases. The results also indicated that the original method of binding, i. e. paperback vs. hard cover was significant. However, dimension (the size of the book) proved to be only significant in the case of paper back books. In addition, the decisions to prebind or rebind was found to be more cost-effective when compared to replacing deteriorated bindings with new ones. Finally, it was concluded that the major problems that caused circulating library books to deteriorate were broken or damaged spines and damaged covers...|$|R

In the canonical way, the JAK/STAT pathway is represented by a transmembrane receptor associated with a Janus kinase (JAK), which upon stimulation by an extra-cellular ligand, phosphorylates itself, the receptor and, finally, the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) molecules. Phosphorylated STATs dimerise and translocate to the nucleus where they activate transcription of target genes. The JAK/STAT pathway has been conserved throughout evolution, and all known components are present in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Besides hematopoietic and immunity functions, the pathway is also required during development for processes including embryonic segmentation, tracheal morphogenesis, posterior spiracle formation etc. This study describes Drosophila Ken&Barbie (Ken) as a selective regulator of JAK/STAT signalling. ken mutations identified in a screen for modulators of an eye overgrowth phenotype, caused by over-expression of the pathway ligand unpaired, also interact genetically with the pathway receptor domeless (dome) and the transcription factor stat 92 E. Over-expression of Ken can phenocopy developmental defects known to be caused by the loss of JAK/STAT signalling. These genetic interactions suggest that Ken may function as a negative regulator of the pathway. Ken has C-terminal Zn-finger domain, presumably for DNA binding, and N-terminal BTB/POZ domain, often found in transcriptional repressors. Using EGFP-fused construct expressed in vivo revealed nuclear accumulation of Ken. Therefore, it is proposed that Ken may act as a suppresser of STAT 92 E target genes. An in vitro assay, termed SELEX, determined that Ken specifically binds to a DNA sequence, with the essential for DNA recognition core overlapping that of STAT 92 E. This interesting observation suggests that not all STAT 92 E sites may also allow Ken binding. Strikingly, when effects of ectopic Ken on the expression of putative JAK/STAT pathway target genes were examined, only a subset of the genes tested, namely vvl, trh and kni, were down-regulated by Ken, whereas some others, such as eve and fj, appeared to be unresponsive. Further analysis of vvl, one of the genes susceptible to ectopic Ken, was undertaken. In the developing hindgut, expression of vvl is JAK/STAT pathway dependent, but remains repressed in the posterior spiracles, despite the stimulation of STAT 92 E by Upd in their primordia. Importantly, ken is also expressed in the developing posterior spiracles. Strikingly, up-regulation of vvl is observed in these tissues in ken mutant embryos. These imply that while ectopic Ken is sufficient to repress the expression of vvl in the hindgut, endogenous Ken is also necessary to prevent its activation in the posterior spiracles. It is therefore conceivable that ectopic vvl expression in the posterior spiracles of the ken mutants {{may be the result of}} de-repression of endogenous STAT 92 E activity. Another consequence of these observations is a fine balance that must exist between STAT 92 E and Ken activities. Apparently, endogenous level of Ken is sufficient to repress vvl, but not other, as yet unidentified, JAK/STAT pathway targets, whose presumable activation by STAT 92 E is required for posterior spiracle development as the embryos mutant for dome, the receptor of the pathway, show severe spiracle defects. These defects are also observed in the embryos mis-expressing Ken. Though it is possible that the posterior spiracle phenotype caused by higher levels of Ken results from a JAK/STAT pathway independent activity, it seems to be more likely that Ken acts in a dosage dependent manner, and extra Ken is able to further antagonise JAK/STAT pathway target genes. While STAT 92 E binding sites required for target gene expression have been poorly characterised, the existence of genome data allows the prediction of candidate STAT 92 E sites present in target genes promoters to be attempted. When a 6 kb region containing the putative regulatory domains flanking the vvl locus are examined, only a single potential STAT 92 E binding site located 825 bp upstream of the translational start can be detected. Strikingly, this site also includes a <b>perfect</b> Ken <b>binding</b> sequence. Such an in silico observation, though consistent with both Ken DNA binding assay in vitro and regulation of STAT 92 E target genes in vivo, however, requires further analysis. The JAK/STAT pathway is implicated in a variety of processes during embryonic and larval development as well as in imago. In each case, stimulation of the same transcription factor results in different developmental outcomes. While many potential mechanisms have been proposed and demonstrated to explain such pleiotropy, the present study indicates that Ken may represent another mechanism, with which signal transduction pathways are controlled. Ken selectively down-regulates a subset of potential target genes and so modifies the transcriptional profile generated by activated STAT 92 E - a mechanism, which may be partially responsible for differences in the morphogenetic processes elicited by JAK/STAT signalling during development. Wechselwirkungen zwischen Zellen während der embryonalen Entwicklung sind von großer Bedeutung für die Koordination von Wachstum, Differenzierung und Erhaltung vieler verschiedener Zelltypen. Für diese Koordination muss jede Zelle sowohl die Signale von benachbarten als auch von weit entfernten Zellen in räumlich und zeitlich adäquate Entwicklungsvorgänge übersetzen. Einer enormen Zahl von Differenzierungsvorgängen unterschiedlicher Zelltypen steht dabei eine vergleichbar geringe Anzahl verschiedener Signaltransduktionswege gegenüber. Deshalb werden solche Signalwege mehrfach für unterschiedliche Entwicklungsprozesse gebraucht. Bei Säugetieren z. B. spielt der JAK/STAT-Signalweg für die Prä-Gastrulations-Stadien der Embryogenese, für die Differenzierung des Brustdrüsen-Epithels, für die Hämatopoese und auch für das Immunsystem eine bedeutende Rolle. Im kanonischen Modell der JAK/STAT-Signalübertragung ist ein Transmembran-Rezeptor mit der Janus Kinase (JAK) assoziiert, die nach Stimulation durch einen extrazellulären Liganden zuerst sich selbst und dann auch den Rezeptor und STAT-Moleküle (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) phosphoryliert. Phosphorylierte STAT-Molekule dimerisieren, werden in den Kern transportiert und aktivieren dort die Transkription von Ziel-Genen. Der JAK/STAT-Signalweg ist evolutionär konserviert. Auch das Genom der Fruchtfliege Drosophila melanogaster enthält alle bekannten Komponenten des Signalwegs, deren Aktivität während der Hämotopoese und bei der Immunantwort eine Rolle spielt und für verschiedene Entwicklungsprozesse. In dieser Arbeit wird Ken&Barbie (Ken) als negativer Regulator der JAK/STAT-Signalübertragung bei Drosophila melanogaster beschreiben. Mutationen im ken Lokus wurden in einer systematischen Suche nach Modulatoren identifiziert. ken interagiert genetisch mit dem Signalwegs-Liganden unpaired, dem Rezeptor domeless (dome) und dem Transkriptionfaktor stat 92 E. Über-Expression von Ken resultiert in Entwicklungsstörungen, die auch durch den Verlust von JAK/STAT-Signal-Aktivität verursacht werden. Die genetischen Interaktionen deuten auf eine negativ-regulatorische Funktion von Ken im JAK/STAT-Signalweg hin. Ken enthält eine C-terminale Zn-Finger-Domäne, die vermutlich der DNA-Bindung dient, und eine N-terminale BTB/POZ Domäne, die häufig in transkriptionellen Repressoren auftritt, und ein Ken-EGFP-Reporter-Protein im Nukleus akkumuliert, Darum Ken kann als Suppressor von STAT 92 E Ziel-Genen funktionieren. Ken bindet spezifisch an DNA, und die Zielsequenz überlappt mit der von STAT 92 E. Diese Beobachtung lässt vermuten, dass nicht alle STAT 92 E Zielsequenzen die Bindung von Ken erlauben. Es ist daher wahrscheinlich, dass unter den DNA-Sequenzen, an die STAT 92 E binden kann, nur wenige auch die Bindung von Ken ermöglichen. Diese Hypothese wird durch Experimente untermauert, in denen der Effekt von ektopisch exprimiertem Ken auf die Expression von Ziel-Genen des JAK/STAT-Signalwegs untersucht wurde. Nur einige dieser Gene, nämlich vvl, trh and kni, wurden von Ken supprimiert. Die Expression anderer JAK/STAT Ziel-Gene wie eve and fj waren von ektopischer Ken-Aktivität nicht betroffen. Unter Berücksichtigung der oben vorgeschlagenen Hypothese hängt die spezifische Suppression durch Ken von der Sequenz der STAT 92 E-Bindestellen in den untersuchten Zielgen-Promotoren ab. Zur genaueren Klärung wurden weitergehende Studien mit dem gemeinsamen Ziel-Gen vvl durchgeführt. Im sich entwickelnden Hinterdarm hängt die Expression von vvl von JAK/STAT-Aktivität ab. Trotz Stimulation von STAT 92 E durch Upd wird vvl-Expression in den Bereichen, aus denen sich das posteriore Atemloch bildet und wo auch ken exprimiert wird, nicht aktiviert. Interessanterweise, wird vvl vermehrt in den genannten Geweben exprimiert, wenn Ken-Aktivität durch eine Mutation gestört wird. Diese Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass ektopisch exprimiertes Ken ausreicht, die Expression von vvl im Hinterdarm zu reprimieren, und endogenes Ken notwendig ist, um vvl-Aktivierung im posterioren Atemloch zu verhindern. Es scheint daher, dass ektopische Expression von vvl im Gewebe, aus dem das posteriore Atemloch hervorgeht, das Ergebnis von De-Reprimierung endogener STAT 92 E-Aktivität ist. STAT 92 E-Bindestellen, die für die Expression von Ziel-Genen notwendig sind, wurden bisher kaum charakterisiert. Die verfügbaren Daten des Genom-Projekts ermöglichen allerdings die Vorhersage von möglichen STAT 92 E-Bindestellen in Promotoren von potenziellen Ziel-Genen. So befindet sich in einer durch Sequenz-Analyse vorhergesagten 6 kb großen regulatorischen Region, die den vvl locus flankiert, eine einzige mögliche STAT 92 E Bindestelle (825 bp vor dem Translationstart). Diese Bindestelle überlappt mit eine in-vitro-Ken-Bindesequenz. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird Ken als Teil eines neuartigen Mechanismus vorgestellt, mit dem Signaltransduktionswege kontrolliert werden können. Ken suprimiert eine Teilmenge möglicher Ziel-Gene, die der JAK/STAT-Signalweg aktiviert, und verändert dadurch das STAT 92 E-abhängige Expressionsprofil. Dieser Mechanismus könnte für die unterschiedlichen Auswirkungen des JAK/STAT-Signalwegs in den morphogenetischen Prozessen während der Entwicklung verantwortlich sein...|$|R
