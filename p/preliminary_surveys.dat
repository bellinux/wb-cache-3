25|$|The {{county council}} debated {{conversion}} of the line to standard gauge in 1910, and issued a request to the government. It considered the question in 1912, and granted funding for <b>preliminary</b> <b>surveys.</b> After petitioning from most municipal councils and various commercial interests in 1913, Parliament agreed to the funding in April 1914. A railway committee was established, and Drammen District proposed that its lines be converted. By the time the issue had reached Parliament in 1923, a {{conversion of the}} Vestfold Line {{had fallen out of}} the plans. However, several of the surrounding railways were converted to standard gauge.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{successful}} {{construction of the}} Trunk Line from Oslo and Eidsvoll in 1854, proposals were made for other projects, even a line to connect the capital with Trondheim. The start of the Røros Line would, however, be tied to two smaller railway projects which instead would serve regional needs. Both had their basis in the need for hauling lumber along difficult terrain. After local initiatives, the Ministry of the Interior gave Carl Abraham Pihl the task of <b>preliminary</b> <b>surveys</b> of two routes. In Sør-Trøndelag a route from Trondheim to Støren was considered, while in Hedmark the a route was proposed which would link Østerdalen to Hamar, where cargo and passengers could be transshipped and freighted by ship down the lake of Mjøsa to Eidsvoll.|$|E

25|$|The lack {{of early}} {{interest}} in a railway in Østfold {{was caused by the}} ice-free Oslofjord and the perceived non-necessity of build a line where a suitable waterway already existed. Proposals for a railway through the county then known as Smaalenene were first launched with two independent letters to the editor in 1866. They exemplified the debate which would follow, with one proposing a route along the coast through the larger coastal towns, while the other proposed an inner route via Askim and Rakkestad. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>surveys</b> were carried out the following year, which also investigated two routes to the Swedish border, one via Tistedalen and one along Iddefjord. The government was at first less enthusiastic, in part because they were concerned that no line would be built on the Swedish side.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, {{the first}} oil company teams carried out <b>preliminary</b> <b>surveys.</b> An onshore {{concession}} was granted to Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) in 1939, and an offshore concession to D'Arcy Exploration Ltd in 1952. Oil was discovered under an old pearling {{bed in the}} Persian Gulf, Umm Shaif, in 1958, and in the desert at Murban in 1960. The first cargo of crude was exported from Jabel Dhanna in Abu Dhabi in 1962. As oil revenues increased, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, undertook a massive construction program, building schools, housing, hospitals and roads. When Dubai's oil exports commenced in 1969, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, was also able to use oil revenues to improve his people's quality of life.|$|E
25|$|The Toronto, Grey and Bruce and the Toronto and Nipissing Railways were promoted, at {{the same}} time, and with similar objectives, by an {{interlocking}} group of Ontario businessmen and politicians. It {{is not surprising that}} the group should economise by employing one Chief Engineer who would apply the same design principles and choices on both lines. The first consulting Engineer in Canada was John Edward Boyd of New Brunswick, who conducted the <b>preliminary</b> <b>surveys</b> over the ground to Orangeville and Uxbridge. Douglas Fox came to Canada several times in 1868 and 1869 to support the parliamentary campaign and verify the surveys. On his return to England in the summer of 1869 he made arrangements for an associate, Edmund Wragge, to come to Canada at once to take up the engineering of both lines. In August Wragge visited Pihl in Norway to see his narrow-gauge lines, and arrived in Toronto in September 1869. The tenders for the first sections of line were immediately put out.|$|E

25|$|The route {{over the}} Sierra had been plotted out by Judah in <b>preliminary</b> <b>surveys</b> {{before his death}} in 1863. Judah's deputy, Samuel S. Montague was {{appointed}} as Central Pacific's new Chief Engineer, with Lewis M. Clement as Assistant Chief Engineer and Charles Cadwalader as second assistant. To build the new railroad, detailed surveys had to be run that showed where the cuts, fills, trestles, bridges and tunnels would have to be built. Work that was identified as taking a long time was started as soon as its projected track location could be ascertained and work crews, supplies and road work equipment found to be sent ahead. Tunnels, trestles and bridges were nearly all built this way. The spread-out nature of the work resulted in the work being split into two divisions, with L.M. Clement taking the upper division from Blue Cañon to Truckee and Cadwalader taking the lower division from Truckee to the Nevada border. Other assistant engineers were assigned to specific tasks such as building a bridge, tunnel or trestle which was done by the workers under experienced supervisors.|$|E

500|$|The State Board of Education {{approved}} the site purchase in July 1855, but months later had proven {{unable to make}} any progress in deciding on basics for the college—including what buildings it might require. The Board turned to Holmes, who had continued to acquaint himself with the site by making some <b>preliminary</b> <b>surveys.</b> After some consideration, he reported back to the Board that the school required two main buildings: a combination classroom and office building, and a dormitory. Thus, John C. Holmes is {{the man responsible for}} the design of both College Hall and the original dormitory, now known as Saints' Rest. In addition, although Professor Harold W. Lautner (who, as the official Director of Campus Planning from 1945 to 1969, was a direct successor to Holmes) makes a point of noting that [...] "who proposed the sites for these first buildings is not answered in any record," [...] he concurs that Holmes' ubiquitous hand makes it unlikely that anyone else made that decision.|$|E

500|$|Throughout Guam, 95 {{percent of}} homes were destroyed, and those left {{standing}} were damaged. Nearly every non-typhoon-proof home was severely {{damaged or destroyed}} {{and a majority of}} typhoon-proof buildings sustained extensive damage. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>surveys</b> by the Red Cross on November15 indicated that at least 5,000homes were destroyed and another 3,000 were severely damaged. Approximately 45,000people, mostly Guamanians, were left homeless. A total of 11people lost their lives and about 100others were injured. At least four of the deaths were due to collapsed buildings, including three in one home that buckled due to pounding surf. Another death resulted from decapitation by airborne debris. Losses across the island amounted to $250million (1962USD). The damage across Guam was described as [...] "'much more serious" [...] than it had been during the second Battle of Guam, when American troops retook the island from the Japanese. The U.S. Navy described the damage as equal to that of an indirect hit from a nuclear bomb. Guerrero said that the recovery effort of the previous 17 years had been [...] "completely wiped out".|$|E
