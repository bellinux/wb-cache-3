40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} {{study in which}} the rights of tenderers and contractors and related procurement regulations are discussed and compared under Saudi <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>contract</b> regulations and those of England and Wales. This thesis does not aim to be a comprehensive comparative study, but presents examples to illustrate the issues under discussion. A central aim {{of the study is}} to consider whether Saudi <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>contract</b> regulations are suitable {{to protect the rights of}} tenderers and contractors and to solve their problems in the rapid development of the country. Is the Purchasing Law, in particular, able to cover the rapid development in procurement and the economy in Saudi Arabia and the world? This question is asked in order to examine the weaknesses of current procurement regulations and to explore procurement claims that the Purchasing Law fails to address tenderers' and contractors' rights and concerns. Many criticisms have been raised regarding Saudi <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>contract</b> regulations, especially the Saudi Purchasing Law. Although the Saudi government has called for the procurement sector to play a greater role in national development, the Purchasing Law does not support this aim. It has remained unchanged since it was enacted in 1979, despite rapid economic changes in the country. Contractors, traders, banks, and Saudi Chambers of Commerce have complained that they are too constrained by the provisions of the Purchasing Law. The ten chapters of this thesis examine the rights of procurement tenderers and contractors throughout the procedures to prepare and award a <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>contract.</b> In addition to identifying the principles of procurement regulations, this study investigates the rights of tenderers and contractors from the first steps of tendering procedures to the awarding of the contract and afterwards. Once the contracting authority selects a successful contractor this study highlights his rights to obtain his financial payment and to obtain remedy if the contracting authority breaches its contractual obligations. The study examines case law, procurement regulations, circulars and governmental procedures in procurement. The study results indicate that Saudi <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>contract</b> regulations in general and the Purchasing Law in particular are inadequate to keep pace with development requirements in the country. More specifically, the findings show that current Saudi procurement regulations are in fact obstacles to the development of the procurement sector, and a main reason for contractors' unwillingness to enter the governmental procurement market.

40|$|The {{electronics}} industry {{supply chain}} is particularly complex, with many companies {{involved in the}} manufacturing process {{and most of them}} far removed from the end user. Events involving well known electronics brands have highlighted the exploitative and unsafe conditions under which many workers in the supply chain operate. • <b>Public</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>contracts</b> worldwide are estimated to be worth one-thousand-billion euros annually and account for 16 per cent of GDP in the European Union. Because of their considerable buying power, public authorities, through their <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>contracts,</b> hold the potential for significant leverage in social and sustainability issues. • Within the European Union, <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>contracts</b> are subject to EU rules which aim to ensure non-discrimination and transparency in the procurement process. These rules also {{determine the extent to which}} social considerations are permitted within the procurement process. • The best opportunity to introduce social considerations is within the contract performance stage of the process, which allows the buyer to specify the conditions to be performed once the contract has been granted. • Developing contract performance conditions which apply throughout the supply chain is challenging for several reasons. Two approaches to using such conditions are available: the use of cascading contract conditions and a contractor-led due diligence approach. • The due diligence approach is suggested as a preferable option since it is less onerous in overall terms, is a responsive model and therefore may be better suited to addressing supply chain problems. It is also more practicable from a contractual perspective. • The necessary features of an effective contract performance condition include requirements for the disclosure of factory locations, determination of labour conditions and standards to be required, provision for access to factories and monitoring and for remediation and the imposition of penalties...|$|E
40|$|Our aim in {{this paper}} is to provide a general {{framework}} in which to determine the optimal penalty fee inducing the contractor to respect the contracted delivery date in <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>contracts</b> (PPCs). We do this by developing a real option model that enables us to investigate the contractor's value of investment timing flexibility which the penalty rule - de facto - introduces. We then apply this setting in order to evaluate the range of penalty fees in the Italian legislation on PPCs: according to our calibration analysis, {{there is no evidence that}} the substantial delays recorded in the execution times of Italian investments are to be due to incorrectly set penalty fees. This result opens the way for other explanations of delays in PPCs: we thus extend our model to include the probability that the penalty is ineffectively enforced and study how calibration results are accordingly affected. We finally show how our model can be used to investigate both the case of a penalty/premium rule and the one of an optimal penalty fee in a concession contract. <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>contracts,</b> penalty fee, investment timing flexibility, investment irreversibility, contract incompleteness, enforceability of rules. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper, {{written in}} German language, deals with <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> {{policies}} in the European Union in an overall economic context. Public sector contracts {{for goods and services}} make up about one sixth of Community GDP. Governments of all levels tend to rely on local firms when extenting delivery contracts. This may be in conflict with the rules of the EU internal market which, for larger contracts, request competition among bidders. The current essay discusses the possible tensions between competition in the market and the regulation of <b>public</b> <b>procurement.</b> <b>Public</b> <b>contracts</b> have been used to implement additional policy goals, such as social and environmental aspects or to aid small business.

40|$|Real life {{implies that}} <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>contracting</b> of {{renewable}} resources results in repeated interaction between a principal and the agents. The present paper analyses ratchet effects in contracting of renewable resources {{and how the}} presence of a resource constraint alters the “standard” ratchet effect result. We use a linear reward scheme to influence the incentives of the agents. It is shown that for some renewable resources we might end up both with more or with less pooling in the first-period compared to a situation without a resource constraint. The reason is that the resource constraint implies a smaller performance de-pendent bonus, which reduces the first-period cost from concealing information {{but at the same time}} the resource constraint may also imply that second-period benefits from this concealment for the efficient agent are reduced. In situations with high likelihood of first-period pooling, the appropriateness of applying lin-ear incentive schemes can be questioned.

40|$|The {{deterioration}} of public finance and increase in global competition have forced governments and public institutions {{to obtain the}} best value for money through the purchase of goods, works and services {{in the form of}} procurement contracts. However, delays in public procurement contract execution times are often a negative by-product, that can quickly erase efficiency gains of public procurement. To avoid delays, the procurer - a Contracting Authority - usually includes in the contract a disincentive fee, i. e. a penalty, for each day of delay the contractor produces in the delivery date and/or an incentive fee, i. e. a premium, for each day the contractor anticipates the delivery date. The recent Italian experience has highlighted that the issue of delays in <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>contracts</b> is relevant: there is puzzling evidence that consistent delays are still present regardless of the fact that explicit penalty/premium clauses are included in procurement contracts.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Public</b> <b>procurement</b> or {{tendering}} {{refers to}} the process followed by public authorities for the procurement of goods and services. In most developed countries, the law imposes public authorities to provide online information to ensure competitive tendering as far as possible, for which the adequate announcement of tenders is an essential requirement. In addition, transparency laws being proposed in such countries are making the monitoring of public contracts by citizens a fundamental right. This paper describes the PPROC ontology, which has been developed to give support to both processes, publication and accountability, by semantically describing <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> processes and <b>contracts.</b> The PPROC ontology is extensive, since it covers not only the usual data about the tender, its objectives, deadlines, and awardees, but also details of the whole process, from the initial contract publication to its termination.

40|$|The article {{evaluates the}} {{provisions}} concerning control of <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> {{procedures carried out}} by the President of the <b>Public</b> <b>Procurement</b> Office in light of the current concepts of supervision in the theory of administrative law and public business law, and particularly the current regulatory supervision. The underlying reason for formulating the research problem {{was the fact that the}} supervision com petences of the President of the <b>Public</b> <b>Procurement</b> Office are linked to other legal means available to the President and that in the event of a negative outcome of such supervision a direct or indirect inﬂuence may be exerted on the legal situation of the contracting authority. The above link is responsible for subsequent activities of the central government administration authority which cannot be seen solely as an examination of the behaviour of the controlled entity for the purpose of determining compliance or lack of compliance with the prescriptive standard arising from the provisions of the <b>Public</b> <b>Procurement</b> Law. The very option of awarding an administrative monetary penalty to a contracting authority or the exclusive, as a rule, capacity of bringing an action in the common law court for invalidation of a public contract entered into in breach of the provisions of the Law allows to conclude that this sequence of legal actions may be qualiﬁed as supervision in substantive administrative law. A supervisory impact on the contracting authority in the form of legal means mentioned above becomes even more prominent when combined with a supervision performed prior to the conclusion of a <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>contract</b> when a correction of the result of the procurement procedure is still possible so that it is compliant with the provisions of the <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> law. 412951225 Studia Prawa Publiczneg...|$|R
40|$|Corrupt {{behaviour}} is {{a common}} practice with negative effects on the whole of society. For instance, if a company wins a <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>contract</b> in an unfair way, it enriches itself {{not only at the}} expense of competition, but also {{at the expense of the}} whole of society, as the best applicant has not necessarily been selected within such a procurement. The same applies in the case of a supplier launching an unsafe product onto the market, threatening the health of everyone who buys it. In order to prevent such malpractice and eliminate their negative effects, the cooperation of persons aware of such behaviours is necessary. In order to ensure such cooperation, however, the existence of instruments protecting whistle-blowers against various sanctions (especially by employers) is necessary. As Slovak legislation did not include a regulation of procedures for reporting malpractice and protecting whistle-blowers, a new law aimed at solving such issues was enacted in October, 2014. The given legal regulation took effect on January 1, 2015.
