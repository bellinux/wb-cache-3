5|$|The {{motion of}} the fluid is {{sustained}} by convection, motion driven by buoyancy. The temperature increases towards {{the center of the}} Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called compositional convection.

40|$|The Liu and Jordan {{method of}} calculating long term average energy {{collection}} of flat plate collectors is simplified (by about {{a factor of}} 4), and generalized to all collectors, concentration and non-concentrating. The only meteorological input needed are the long term average daily total hemispherical insolation H/sub h/ on a horizontal surface and, for thermal collectors the average ambient temperature. The collector is characterized by optical efficiency, heat loss (or U-value), heat extraction efficiency, concentration ratio and tracking mode. An average operating temperature is assumed. Interaction with storage can be included by combining the present model with the f-chart method of Beckman, Klein and Duffie. Formulas and examples are presented for five collector types: flat plate, compound parabolic concentrator, concentrator with E. -W. tracking <b>axis,</b> concentrator with <b>polar</b> tracking <b>axis,</b> and concentrator with two axis tracking. The examples show that even for relatively low temperature applications and cloudy climates (50 degrees C in New York in February), concentrating collectors can outperform the flat plate. The method has been validated against hourly weather data (with measurements of hemispherical and beam insolation), and {{has been found to}} have an average accuracy better than 3 % for the long term average radiation available to solar collectors. The suitability of this method for comparison studies is illustrated by comparing in a location independent manner the radiation availability for several collector types or operating conditions: two axis tracking versus one <b>axis</b> tracking; <b>polar</b> tracking <b>axis</b> versus east-west tracking axis; fixed versus tracking flat plate; effect of ground reflectance; and acceptance for diffuse radiation as function of concentration ratio...|$|R
