This study concludes that there is an effect of age on the incidence of cervical cancer, which ??? 35 years of age is a risk factor of cancer. Then, effect of age of first marriage / early sex on the incidence of cervical cancer, which ??? 20 years of age is a risk factor for cervical cancer.

Methods: After suture repair of an incisional hernia (mean follow-up of 4. 6 years), 72 patients (32 female, 40 male, mean age 63. 6 years) completed the SF- 36 Health Survey Questionnaire to evaluate their current postoperative as well as their past preoperative <b>quality</b> of <b>life.</b> Results: All domains improved significantly after the operation.
