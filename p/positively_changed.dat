Gray helped secure a place for Foreman at Shaw University where she studied English as well as secured her two part-time jobs for her on campus, one in the school cafeteria and the other cleaning the teacher's dormitory. When Dr. Daniel, a teacher at Shaw was offered the Presidency job at Virginia State University, Foreman went along and worked as his housekeeper.

30|$|For example, {{consider}} the case of Peter. Peter is directly connected to Meg, a recipient of coaching, who following coaching, has <b>positively</b> <b>changed</b> how she interacts with others. These others, in turn, have <b>positively</b> <b>changed</b> the quality of their interactions with others. If we assume that Peter would observe at least some of these changes, Peter might begin to experience the work place differently, even though he himself had not been coached. However, we also need to take into consideration the number of people to whom Peter is also connected who have shown no change, or even negative change in their interactions. The experience of these connections may serve to inhibit any positive shift in Peter’s experience of the workplace. Hence, it is important to {{consider the}} full range of Peter’s experience of interaction in the organisation. By measuring individual change in relation to organisational level interconnectivity, this approach seeks to account for the interconnected context in which an individual is embedded.|$|E

40|$|Abstract— This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a smart-cup system, developed to support heart-failure patients with their drinking behavior. The design is used as an example in understanding how clinical or behavioral interventions may be continuously provided at distance to a patient living at home. It aims to enhance communication between a patient and her care provider. The system also aims to reduce the financial implication of distant personal care. The design principle borrows from the Interaction Frogger Framework especially by coupling users action to a feedback or feed-forward mechanism. This is believed to facilitate a reflection on action and in return <b>positively</b> <b>change</b> behavior...|$|R
