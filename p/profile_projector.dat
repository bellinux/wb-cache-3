50|$|The {{projector}} magnifies {{the profile}} of the specimen, and displays this on the built-in projection screen. On this screen there is typically a grid that can be rotated 360 degrees so the X-Y axis of the screen can be aligned with a straight edge of the machined part to examine or measure. This projection screen displays {{the profile of}} the specimen and is magnified for better ease of calculating linear measurements.An edge of the specimen to examine may be lined up with the grid on the screen. From there, simple measurements may be taken for distances to other points. This is being done on a magnified profile of the specimen. It can be simpler as well as reduce errors by measuring on the magnified projection screen of a <b>profile</b> <b>projector.</b> The typical method for lighting is by diascopic illumination, which is lighting from behind. This type of lighting is also called transmitted illumination when the specimen is translucent and light can pass through it. If the specimen is opaque, then the light will not go through it, but will form a profile of the specimen. Measuring of the sample can be done on the projection screen. A <b>profile</b> <b>projector</b> may also have episcopic illumination (which is light shining from above). This useful in displaying bores or internal areas that may need to be measured.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Aim of this {{in vitro}} study is to {{evaluate}} the loss of tooth enamel after acid etching using a custom made <b>profile</b> <b>projector</b> (× 100). Materials and Methods: Twenty human extracted maxillary and mandibular premolars were collected, and each tooth was mounted on an acrylic block (2 cm × 1 cm) along with a 0. 8 mm stainless steel wire partially embedded in acrylic {{in front of the}} buccal surface of the teeth. The 0. 8 mm wire was used for reference; the image appeared on the projection screen was 80 mm implying that magnification × 100 has been achieved. Fabrication of custom made <b>profile</b> <b>projector</b> followed the principles of optics. Two projections of each sample before and after etching were projected. The projection was recorded using tracing paper. The difference between the two tracings before and after etching was measured using a millimeter scale. This reading was converted into microns, i. e., 1 mm = 10 μ. Results: The statistical method used for this study is a measure of central tendency. The research shows that the average enamel loss was around 15. 25 microns. The median is a value at the midpoint of the group, and median for enamel loss is 15 μ. Mode for enamel loss is 15 μ that means most frequent or most repetitive enamel loss is 15 μ. The maximum enamel loss was 25 μ, and minimum of that was 10 μ. Conclusions: The results {{of this study indicate that}} etching enamel with 37 % phosphoric acid for 30 s loses 15 μ of surface enamel using an economical and efficient custom made <b>profile</b> <b>projector...</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze the display of colors in digital projection. For this purpose the digital {{projector}} NEC NP 210 was used. The measurements were performed in accordance with the instructions and recommendations of ISO standards. Our goal was to research the creation of color <b>profile</b> of the <b>projector</b> using a EyeOne Pro spectrophotometer and to establish whether the size of color gamut of standardized sRGB color space can be reached by characterization of the digital projector modules. By using the color chart Color Checker Classic, the photometric and colorimetric accuracy of the characterized and uncharacterized projection were evaluated. In the final part of the research, comparison between the colorimetric accuracy of the computer screen and the digital projector was performed. The results showed that by module characterization of the NEC NP 210 Movie projector in studio conditions, the same size of the color space could not be achieved as by using the default sRGB module. Evaluation of colorimetric accuracy by using the digitalized color chart Color Checker Classic provides usable results, especially when the display of chromatic colors with emphasis on skin tones, and achromatic colors with emphasis on grey balance or chromaticity respectively, were examined. Based on the obtained results of the computer screen and digital projector comparison, it could be concluded that both compared computer screens match the standards. Overall, the NEC NP 210 projector with the sRGB default module without profile could be also used if necessary. Thus, we can sum up that digital projection displaying standardized sRGB color space could not be comparable to a high quality CRT or LCD computer screen...|$|R
