40|$|Certain tax jurisdictions enable {{taxpayers to}} request binding decisions, known as "tax rulings", {{as to how}} tax provisions, notably those on {{transfer}} pricing, will be applied to a particular case. However, according to the European Commission, several EU Member States have employed tax rulings to grant <b>preferential</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>treatments</b> to select multinational groups, such as Amazon, Apple, FIAT, and Starbucks.

Regard is then had to the unique challenges posed by the recovery of the alleged aids granted via the contested tax rulings as well as to the strategies proposed to stop the "alternative use" of this instrument by Member States. Finally, this article outlines the implications that the prospective CJEU rulings in this particular area of fiscal aids may have on the exercise of national competences in the field of direct taxation, on the international cooperation against aggressive tax planning, and on the progress towards a fiscal union...|$|R

40|$|This paper marshals {{a variety}} of {{different}} types of evidence in considering the degree of equity in the government's treatment of children vis-a-vis adults, particularly the current elderly. The paper begins by showing that poverty rates of children have, over the past two decades, risen dramatically while those of the elderly have fallen. Next, it shows that, over this same time frame, the levels of consumption and income of the elderly have risen relative to those of other Americans, including children. The paper then turns to the role of government policy in influencing these trends. It documents the high level of transfer payments going to the elderly relative to those going to children, even if one includes educational expenditures on children as a transfer payment. But the paper argues that such point-in-time comparisons are invalid because they fail to account for the fact that, at a point in time, children and the elderly are at different stages of their life cycles, Controlling for the stage of the life cycle requires examining the government's <b>fiscal</b> <b>treatment</b> of generations over their entire lifetimes. Accordingly, the paper compares the lifetime <b>fiscal</b> <b>treatment</b> of generations. Specifically, it presents/projects lifetime net tax rates for generations born from 1900 through the present as well as for generations that will be born in the future. These lifetime tax rates indicate that today's and tomorrow's children could well end up paying as much as 50, 60, or even 70 percent of their lifetime incomes to the government while generations that are now old will end up paying only about 25 percent of their lifetime incomes to the government. While the paper cautions that generational equity {{is in the eye of}} the beholder, such disparate taxation of generations does considerable violence to standard norms of generational equity. ...|$|R

Home production of meals requires the combination of food and time inputs. The <b>fiscal</b> <b>treatment</b> in home production of both the inputs and the final product differs from market production of meals, generating different channels of inefficiency.

The results suggest that if we focus only on aggregate welfare, the model fails to capture important distributional issues. We also present some caveats to previous simulation results on aggregate welfare that are related to the importance of the elasticity of substitution between food and time in the household production of meals. household production, optimal taxation, incidence...|$|R

After that, some parents may substitute childcare for earnings b...|$|R
40|$|In most {{developed}} countries, {{an increase}} in the retirement-aged population has put considerable financial pressure on public pension systems. In response, a number of countries have reformed their systems and have encouraged a substitution toward private pensions and tax-sheltered saving. As the baby-boom cohort reaches retirement age, it is likely that further policy change will be required; however, knowledge about the behaviour of people as they approach and reach retirement age and how they might react to policy change is vital for the formulation of good policy. In the UK, for example, the <b>fiscal</b> <b>treatment</b> of pensions has changed, leading to changes in the way people save for retirement.

40|$|Increased {{integration}} of labour and capital markets creates significant {{challenges for the}} welfare states of modern Europe. Taxation of capital and labour that finances extensive programmes of cash and in-kind redistribution creates incentives for capital owners and workers to locate in regions where they obtain favourable <b>fiscal</b> <b>treatment.</b> Competition among countries for mobile resources constrains their ability to alter the distribution of income and may lead to reductions in the {{size and scope of}} redistributive policies. Mobility of labour and capital is imperfect, however. Recent trends indicate that labour and capital are neither perfectly mobile nor perfectly immobile, but rather adjust gradually to market conditions and economic policies. This paper presents an explicitly dynamic analysis showing that governments can achieve some redistribution when it is costly for factors of production to relocate. As the costs of factor mobility fall, however, the effectiveness of redistributive policies is more limited, and governments have weaker incentives to pursue them. Liberalized immigration policies, EU enlargement, and other steps that promote {{integration of}} the factors markets of Western Europe with those of surrounding regions thus present a challenge to policy-makers if they also wish to maintain fiscal systems with extensive redistribution...|$|R
40|$|In this contribution, the {{possibilities}} of capital accumulation via homeownership in the Dutch context are described. We conclude that there is dichotomy in the Dutch housing market, where in particular households owning their own house before 1992 have seen their capital grow strongly and have profited from this development both in and outside the housing market. This growth {{was made possible by}} the strong increase in house prices, the ample financing opportunities, the fiscal facilities and the limited supply of newly constructed high quality owner-occupied houses. In this context one can speak of a lever operating generated by the owner-occupied housing sector. The baby-boom generation profited most from this operation. On the other hand, those households which have not yet, or only recently, entered the owner-occupied housing sector, are confronted with enormous risks. In addition to the risks for individual houseowners, there is also a risk that the stability of the Dutch economy will be damaged because house price rises which go together with a long-term substantial credit expansion can become detached from the underlying fundamental factors.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} house price {{developments in}} the Netherlands, specifically focussing on the question whether current house prices in the Dutch owner-occupied market are likely to decrease. We analyse three aspects of the question based on a literature review: (1) {{whether there is a}} house price bubble ready to burst; (2) whether house prices will decline in response to the credit crisis that started in 2007; and (3) whether it is likely that house prices will decrease as a result of reforms in the tax treatment of home owners. The outcomes of the two available Dutch models predict that even without fiscal reform (and before any effects of the global financial crisis make themselves felt) prices in the housing market will probably come under pressure in the sense that contrary to the previous decades growth of real prices will be zero. Changing the <b>fiscal</b> <b>treatment</b> of owneroccupiers would cause real house prices to decline over the next years. The timing of such measures may be considered most unfortunate now that the global credit crunch seems to be affecting the Dutch economy as well. OTB Research Institut...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} three {{reforms of the}} Belgian old-age pension system were {{examined}} on retirement behaviour, government budget and income distribution of the old-age retired. On {{the basis of a}} large administrative micro-dataset used to estimate and simulate a discrete-time hazard model we found that reforms of the old-age pension system that penalize early retirement, and in particular penalize early retirement of the rich more than the poor, are not only the ones that enhance the financial sustainability of the system at most {{but at the same time}} lead to the strongest decrease of income inequality and relative poverty among the old-age retired. On the contrary, reforms that compensate retirement beyond the age of eligibility like the “pension bonus” recently implemented in Belgium lead to budget deficits and at the same time to a higher income inequality among the old-age retired.

40|$|A {{well-known}} {{principle of}} welfare economics states that an efficient resources allocation {{can be achieved}} in a competitive economy when market prices {{are in line with}} social marginal costs. When applied to the transport sector, this implies that the price of the various transport modes should be made equal to the sum of marginal production and external costs, like congestion, accidents, pollution, and road maintenance. It is sometimes argued that the internalisation of external costs would bring about a change in demand patterns with a shift towards public transport and cleaner modes. But, public transport is already favoured by a discriminatory <b>fiscal</b> <b>treatment.</b> Whereas public services are normally (heavily) subsidised, private transport is taxed in several ways and, in some countries, quite substantially so. The application of the pricing principle, therefore, critically depends on how the subsidisation of public services is interpreted. This paper addresses the issue of optimal pricing of urban transport, using different hypotheses about the treatment of public services. After reviewing some traditional arguments in favour of public transport subsidisation, a new approach, based on uncertainty and option values, is discussed. The implications of this approach are investigated by means of an applied model, where optimal prices for urban transport services in the city of Bologna are computed under alternative assumptions...|$|R
