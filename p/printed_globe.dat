5000|$|The Johannes Schöner Globe (1515), a <b>printed</b> <b>globe,</b> {{was made}} in 1515. Two exemplars survive, one at the Historisches Museum in Frankfurt and the other at the Herzogin Anna Amalia Bibliothek, at Weimar. There {{can be little doubt}} that Schöner was {{familiar}} with the globe made in Nuremberg by Martin Behaim in 1492. A strait between the southern tip of America and the land to the south can be found on Schöner’s globe before its [...] "official discovery" [...] by Ferdinand Magellan in 1520. The strait is at 53 degrees south. The strait is shown at about 40 degrees south on the 1515 globe. Schöner accompanied his globe with an explanatory treatise, Luculentissima quaedam terrae totius descriptio (“A Most Lucid Description of All Lands”).The Johannes Schöner Globe (1520), a manuscript globe, {{was made in}} 1520. The globe shows the Antarctic continent which had not been explored at that date. On Schöner’s 1515 and 1520 globes, AMERICA is shown as an island, as he explained in the Luculentissima: America, the fourth part of the world, and the other islands belonging to it. In this way it may be known that the Earth is in four parts and that the first three parts are continents, that is, terra firma, but that the fourth is an island, for it is seen to be surrounded everywhere by the seas”. [...] This is drawn from the Cosmographiae Introductio of Martin Waldseemüller, which said: Hitherto whole earth has been divided into three parts, Europe, Africa, and Asia… Now, these parts of the earth have been more extensively explored and a fourth part has been discovered by Amerigo Vespucci... Thus the earth is now known to be divided into four parts. The first three parts are continents, while the fourth is an island, inasmuch as it is found to be surrounded on all sides by the seas. [...] The Johannes Schöner Globe (1523), a <b>printed</b> <b>globe,</b> was made in 1523. It was considered to have been lost until identified by George Nunn in 1927.|$|E

His earliest dated mezzotint is titled Sleeping Cupid and was published in 1677. He based many of his engravings and mezzotints after designs by other artists like Peter Lely, Gérard de Lairesse and Philip Tideman. He published most of his works himself. In Amsterdam, he had a close partnership with his son Leonardus Valck and Peter Schenk the Elder, who married Gerard's sister in 1687.

40|$|The {{recently}} opened Virtual Globes Museum ([URL] {{founded by the}} author at the Department of Cartography and Geoinformatics, Eötvös Loránd University, publishes threedimensional virtual models of old globes on the Internet. The main purpose of the museum is to preserve these artefacts of old cartographers {{and at the same}} time to make them available for anyone who wants to study their content all over the World. In the Virtual Globes Museum project several globes are shown in their current, real state. There is a searchable background database containing detailed datasheets for each globe. The models are fully interactive: visitors can spin the globes around, zoom in and out. Manó Kogutowicz was one of the founders of modern cartography and map publishing in Hungary. He died just 100 years ago, on 22 December 1908 at the age of 57. He had a short, but varied and rich life. György Kisari Balla, researcher of his life, has made a catalogue of his 542 publications (maps, atlases, globes) made between 1884 and 1908, which included six globes. Unfortunately, five of them could not be found by the author of this paper even after searching in the major globe collections. However, several map <b>prints</b> of <b>globes</b> not listed in the catalogue were found. By now these maps have been processed and published in the Virtual Globes Museum. In this way there are already two globes of 51 cm and four of 25. 5 cm diameter in the VGMOne of the 51 cm diameter globes was found at the Cholnoky Collection in Kolozsvár (Cluj-Napoca) with the help of Zsombor Bartos-Elekes, the lecturer of Babeş–Bolyai University, Faculty of Geography.

50|$|An {{analemma}} can {{be traced}} by plotting {{the position of the}} Sun as viewed from a fixed position on Earth at the same clock time every day for an entire year, or by plotting a graph of the Sun's declination against the equation of time.

This curve is commonly <b>printed</b> on terrestrial <b>globes,</b> usually in the eastern Pacific Ocean, the only large tropical region with very little land.

40|$|The Department of Cartography and Geoinformatics at Eötvös Loránd University has {{recently}} started {{a project to}} save the cartographic heritage of globe making first of all for the interest of professionals, students of cartography and geography in Hungary and abroad. In the first stage, those earth and celestial globes are processed digitally by the staff and students of cartography that have some relationship to Hungary. These digital products are continuously placed in the Virtual Globes Museum run by the Department. The collection of this museum is accessible through the Internet. The methods developed for the virtual museum offer new ways of the virtual restoration of damaged globes without any risk, the reconstruction of virtual facsimile globes, and the recreation of virtual contemporary facsimile globes. This paper discusses some of the technical advantages of three dimensional virtual globes. The 3 D products offer great opportunities to examine the map content in detail. They can be easily handled by a mouse {{and can be used}} as demonstration aids in the classroom too. These “new” copies may be most useful for the physical restoration of the existing originals, which are often unique and carefully kept globes. For this purpose, it is most convenient if the map <b>prints</b> of the <b>globes</b> are still available, because they preserved the original state of the product (such as geographical names or colours) much better than the globes that may have been put to damage and light for centuries. An intermediate stage of the digital processing of an outstanding large globe made in Hungary in 1862 is described to show the challenges that cartographers may meet when working with old globes to prepare their virtual copies. The paper introduces the reader to some of the interesting globes that have already been placed in the Virtual Globes Museum (for instance, the detachable earth globe, the globes of Bleau, Kogutowicz). A 2 passage tells the reader method the globes are described along with the images of the globes. The description of globes is given in three languages in the virtual museum. The processing of globes by digital methods requires the introduction and discussion of new terms such as digital virtual facsimile, contemporary facsimile and digital virtual reconstruction. Working out the methods for the digital virtual facsimile and the digital virtual reconstruction of old or historical globes is of major importance in the restoration of globes. In many cases, the colours and letters faded on these globes. The method described in the paper will ensure the restoration without the risk of causing further damage on the existing, sometimes only copies...|$|R
