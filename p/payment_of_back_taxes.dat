25|$|Lane Pryce (Jared Harris); {{recurring}} Season 3, regular Seasons 4–5: The English {{financial officer}} installed by Sterling Cooper's new British parent company. He first {{appears in the}} first episode of Season 3. His role {{is that of a}} strict taskmaster who brings spending under control, in particular by cutting out frivolous expenses. His efforts are so successful, he is to be sent to India to enact cost-cutting measures, a move which Pryce is not looking forward to after having settled in with his wife and child in New York. An unfortunate accident at work handicaps his replacement, thus allowing Pryce to keep his current position. He warms to American culture, and foresees some form of cultural and societal changes in American race relations. When the British parent company is sold at the end of Season 3, Pryce realizes he has become expendable and negotiates to become a founding partner in the new agency that Don Draper, Bert Cooper and Roger Sterling want to form. At Draper's suggestion, Pryce frees Sterling, Cooper, and Draper from their contractual non-compete clauses by firing them, then is fired himself, enabling the four of them to start their own firm. When hard times hit SCDP after Lucky Strike, their largest client, leaves them in Season 4, Pryce liquidates his portfolio in order to pay his share of the cash infusion required by the bank as collateral for a loan that keeps SCDP afloat. His finances already tight, he faces a crisis when the British Inland Revenue demand immediate <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>taxes</b> on the gain from the sale of his portfolio in Season 5. In order to pay the debt, Pryce secretly negotiates a $50,000 line of credit on behalf of the firm and announces to the partners that SCDP has a $50,000 profit and is able to pay bonuses. In anticipation of the bonus, Pryce forges Draper's signature on an early bonus check to himself, and views it as a 13-day loan which will be made good once the bonuses are paid. However, the partners decide to forgo their bonuses despite Pryce's pleading. In the penultimate episode of Season 5, Cooper discovers the cancelled check and confronts Draper, who in turn confronts Pryce, demanding his resignation. That weekend, Pryce types out a resignation letter and hangs himself in his office.|$|E
50|$|After the Civil War, the reconstructionist {{government}} demanded <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>taxes</b> {{for all of}} {{the years}} that the Washington family had paid taxes to the Confederacy rather than the Union. The Washington family could not pay, and by 1871 the family was forced to sell Claymont estate for the modest sum of $10,000 (a third of what it cost to build). Most of the family then moved to Washington State.|$|E

5000|$|While issuing {{the sales}} tax bulletin, Revenue Secretary Dan Meuser said that the Commonwealth would lose an {{estimated}} $380 million in 2011 due to the non-collection of online sales taxes. At issue {{is the presence of}} four Amazon Fulfillment Centers located in Pennsylvania. Early in December 2011, Meuser said that if out-of-state sellers who haven’t previously collected state sales tax register and start collecting the taxes by February 1, 2012, then the Commonwealth would not seek <b>payments</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>taxes.</b> After this deadline, Meuser said the Commonwealth would take enforcement action seeking <b>back</b> <b>taxes.</b> On January 27, 2012, Meuser said that the new tax collection policy was being granted a one time extension until September 1, 2012 because the original [...] "compliance deadline was impractical from operational and technical standpoints." [...] Amazon began collecting sales tax in the state beginning on that September 1 deadline. Currently, Amazon just collects Pennsylvania's 6% sales tax, but does not collect any local sales taxes.|$|R

5000|$|The IRS threw a veil {{of secrecy}} over {{the terms of the}} agreement, citing {{taxpayer}} privacy laws and refusing Freedom of Information Act requests for documents relating to it. While other religious organizations had been required to disclose the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>taxes,</b> Scientology was not. Gibbs implicitly criticized the secrecy, saying that it was [...] "even more surprising that the service made the decision without full disclosure, in light of the prior background." ...|$|E

The Canadian government had ruled that the donations were ineligible for tax deduction since the donors had benefited and ordered <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>taxes</b> and interest from donors. In the settlement the institution gave back 10% of the donations and paid the legal costs of the families.|$|E

The temple of Shamash was the most prominent building in Sippar. Women were just as active as men in the temple and cloister. Only women could become naditu priests. There were generally about two hundred celibate naditu priests of Shamash living in the cloister at a given time. Most were from royal or upper-class families. Iltani, the naditu sister of King Hammurabi, made offerings of date cakes at festivals. She also leased her orchard for <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>taxes</b> and leased her field to a scribe. (140) ...|$|E

They manage to stop the train, and when Tom stands up to Kim and Mr. Parker rebukes his wife for the first time, Mrs. Parker realizes the error of her ways. She and Ma, however, do not disembark in time, and are forced to stop the train {{in the middle of}} a field and use a railroad hand car to get home. By the time that Pa, Mr. Parker, Tom and Kim return to the house, Ma and Mrs. Parker have prepared dinner for the whole happy family.|$|R
2500|$|In 2013, Rubio {{was part}} of the {{bipartisan}} [...] "Gang of Eight" [...] Senators that crafted comprehensive immigration reform legislation. Rubio proposed a plan providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States involving <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> fines and <b>back</b> <b>taxes,</b> background checks, and a probationary period; that pathway was to be implemented only after strengthening border security. [...] The bill passed the Senate 68 to 32 with his support, but Rubio then signaled that the bill should not be taken up by the House because other priorities, like repealing Obamacare, were a higher priority for him; the House never did take up the bill. Rubio has since explained that he still supports reform, but a different approach instead of a single comprehensive bill.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} thoroughbred racing {{track was}} opened by the Monmouth Park Association on July 30, 1870 in Eatontown, New Jersey. In 1878 it {{was bought by}} David D. Withers, George L. Lorillard, James Gordon Bennett, Jr., and George P. Wetmore. From 1882 to 1890, the track increased in popularity, but legislation proposed in 1891 and enacted in 1894 barred parimutuel betting in New Jersey, and the track closed its doors. In May 1894, the Township Committee at Eatontown, New Jersey ordered the seizure and sale of the Monmouth Park Association's grandstand and other property for the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>taxes</b> and on May 7 was sold at a public auction.Some of the major races held at the Long Branch track included the Champion Stakes, the Freehold Stakes, and the Monmouth Cup.

The proposed relocation site, Lot 1555 in Barangay Tambo, was also reportedly {{the object of a}} dispute between the government and a private individual. The individual in question, Dr. Bernardo de León, asserted that the lot at the corner of Kabihasnan Street and Coastal Road, was actually in Barangay San Dionisio, and belonged to his family after he had inherited it in 1984. Parañaque Mayor Florencio Bernabe countered that the property had actually been handed over to the city government in <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>taxes.</b> The lot had been an object of dispute as far back as 1992, when Public Estate Authority security guards entered the compound and destroyed improvements made by De León and his family.|$|E
