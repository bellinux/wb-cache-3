40|$|During three {{experiments}} with squirrel monkeys, stimulus and shock pairings were {{given in the}} presence of a bite tube. Experiments 1 and 2 used a conditioned-suppression procedure in which <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> was reinforced with food. A transparent shield prevented biting of the bar. When the stimulus was paired with shock, <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> decreased (conditioned suppression) and tube biting increased during the stimulus (classically conditioned aggression). When the bite tube was removed on alternate sessions in Experiment 2, there was more suppression when the tube was present, thus suggesting that biting competed with <b>bar</b> <b>pressing.</b> However, this simple competing-response interpretation was complicated by the findings of Experiment 3 where, with naive monkeys, <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> was never reinforced with food, yet <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> was induced during the stimulus and was highest when the bite tube was absent. The fact that stimulus-induced <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> developed inciated that <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> in conditioned-suppression procedures, suppressed or not, may be maintained by two types of control [...] the food reinforcer and induced CS control. The higher rate of induced <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> during the stimulus with the bite tube absent confounds a simple competing response interpretation of conditioned suppression. It suggests that shock-induced responses during conditioned suppression could be both contributing to and competing with responding maintained by food, with the net effect depending on specific but ill-defined features of the situation...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to determine whether}} rats’ preference to freeload (eat food pellets from a food cup) or to work for food (obtain food pellets by <b>bar</b> <b>pressing)</b> could be influenced by observing either a working or freeloading model in an adjacent operant chamber. Following equal amounts of bar press and freeloading training, 18 male Sprague-Dawley rats approximately 100 days cold were divided into three experimental groups. The first group was permitted to view a working model while being presented a choice between <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> and free-loading. A second experimental group was exposed to a freeloading model while also being presented a choice between <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> and freeloading. A control group was permitted to make a choice between working and freeloading with no model present. Two measures of the dependent variable were taken: the ratio of the amount of food earned by <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> to the total amount of food consumed and the number of food pellets obtained by <b>bar</b> <b>pressing.</b> The results of the study indicated that across testing days, there was a trend for the three groups to perform as expected. The group expose to the freeloading models earned only about one-third of its total food consumption while preferring to freeload the remainder. The group exposed to the working models preferred to earn more than half of its total food consumption via <b>bar</b> <b>pressing.</b> The total amount of food earned by the control group, predictably, fell between the amounts earned by the other two groups.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 63 - 64) A two part {{experiment was}} undertaken {{to compare the}} effects of punishment-shock on the consummatory response of eating and the instrumental response of <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> which led to food. The experiment was performed {{in order to test}} Solomon's prediction that a shock which suppressed eating would function as a discriminative stimulus and thus facilitate an instrumental response that led to food (Solomon, 1964). Two levels of shock were used. In {{the first part of the}} experiment, a shock which bad previously been shown to suppress eating in a group of 15 rats was made contingent upon the <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> response of another group of 15 rats. As in both groups were tested once a day for seven consecutive days, and the number of eating responses was compared with the number of bar presses over the seven trials. For the second part of the experiment, a shock which reduced but did not suppress responding (moderate shock) was used. The number of <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> responses and the number of eating responses of two groups of eight rats each were tested by means of a. counterbalanced design. That is, for half of the rats shock was first made contingent upon eating and then upon <b>bar</b> <b>pressing.</b> For the rest of the rats, shock was first made contingent upon <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> and then upon eating. This counterbalanced design was utilized to control for individual differences in reaction to moderate shock. This procedure was also utilized to control for any possible effects previous exposure to shock might have when the contingency was changed for the same S. Ss were tested once a day for 15 minutes on six consecutive days. Under strong shock there was no significant difference between the number of bar presses and the number of eating responses. However, on Trial 1, Ss made significantly more responses (<b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> and eating) added together than they did on Trials 2 to 7, inclusive. Strong shock did not demonstrate any facilitatory properties. Under moderate shock, -Ss made significantly more eating responses than bar presses. Furthermore, the number of eating responses over successive trials was less variable and more stable than was <b>bar</b> <b>pressing.</b> Only when shock was moderate could it be shown to have facilitatory properties and thereby act as a discriminative stimulus. The present research did not support Solemon's prediction. Under strong shock <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> was suppressed as rapidly as was eating. However, under moderate shock it was shown that eating was less affected and more stable from trial to trial than was <b>bar</b> <b>pressing.</b> It was also shown that strong shock did not exhibit facilitatory properties. Only when the shock was moderate did it then demonstrate facilitatory properties and act as a discriminative stimulus...|$|R

40|$|The {{emission}} of a fixed {{number of responses}} by rats was followed by food reinforcement. This fixed number could be accumulated in any way from two continuously available but mutually incompatible response classes, <b>bar</b> <b>pressing,</b> and not <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> for a fixed time period. A preference for one response class was arranged by specifying different maximum reinforcement rates for the two classes. Under selective punishment conditions, the preferred response occasionally led to both food and electric shock, while the non-preferred response led only to food. Selective punishment effects were measured through changes in the preference to the two responses in the sequence. The actions of shock intensity, deprivation, the specification of the non-preferred response, and three drugs were investigated. The results were broadly similar to the work reported by Dardano and Sauerbrunn (1964), who found localized increases in interresponse times before punished responses in fixed-ratio schedules.

40|$|Two avoidance-conditioning {{experiments}} in which responding delayed shocks are reported. Rats receiving {{an average of}} two shocks per minute (imposed condition) could produce, by <b>pressing</b> a <b>bar,</b> a 3 -min alternate condition. Six (Experiment I) or more (Experiment II) shocks occurred in the alternate condition. All shocks in the alternate condition were delayed and delivered at 1 -sec intervals. With long delays, all subjects produced the alternate condition and spent a large percentage of each session in the alternate condition. The first experiment demonstrated that the longer the delay from onset of the alternate condition to onset of the shocks, the more session time spent in the alternate condition. The second experiment indicated that despite increased shock frequency, behavior is acquired and maintained when responding leads to sufficient delay. Individual subjects produced the alternate condition by <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> in essentially one of two patterns. One pattern, termed postshock, involved <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> immediately after shock; the other, termed posttransition, involved responding immediately after the transition from the alternate to the imposed condition.

40|$|Activation of {{the immune}} system results in release of cytokines that affect memory {{retrieval}} and induces a general “sickness behavior” as depicted by decreased appetite, locomotor activity, and motivation to exert effort. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) delivery has been commonly used to study effects of immune system activation in rats using study paradigms that assess changes in motivational behavior. Food-motivated behaviors are driven by positive reinforcement tasks, which rely on adequate memory retrieval to acquire the sought award. Previous studies determined that LPS has a negative impact on food-motivated behavior as depicted by decreased <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> frequency, a quantifiable parameter for operationally defining positive reinforcement. However, previous studies did not consider the role of LPS on locomotor activity on the portrayed decreased <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> frequency. Therefore, this study will evaluate the role of LPS administration and dose on positive reinforcement retention (through <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> for food release) in rats compared to NaCl treated control rats, and whether LPS has an effect on locomotor activity. It was hypothesized that an immune response via LPS delivery will affect memory retrieval in rats in the form of positive reinforcement tasks (lower bar-pressing frequencies), decreased locomotor activity via lower vertical and horizontal movements when compared to control rats. It was found that LPS-treated rats exhibit decreased locomotor activity, and <b>bar</b> <b>pressing</b> frequency compared to control rats, indicating that the decreased desire to exert effort may explain why LPS negatively impacts positive reinforcement retention...|$|R
