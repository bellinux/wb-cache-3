By comparison with the experimental results, the sintering time and the rate constant of restructuring were obtained. Using these values, the change in particle size for different generation conditions could be calculated. The change in morphology of agglomerates can be explained from the comparison of the experimental results with the theoretical calculations: agglomerates with smaller <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> will compact mainly by the subsequent coalescence of <b>primary</b> <b>particles,</b> while agglomerates with larger <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> will compact mainly by a rearrangement of <b>primary</b> <b>particles...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of drug carriers able to incorporate multiple molecular payloads in separate compartments was investigated, using the hetero-aggregation of oppositely charged hydrogel microparticles as the building blocks. The <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> – negatively charged alginate and positively charged chitosan microgels {{with a mean}} diameter of 6 – 7 μm – were produced by spray drying with in situ cross-linking. The kinetics of their hetero-aggregation was measured on-line by static light scattering. The effects of the starting stoichiometry (positive:negative particle ratio), hydrodynamic conditions (agitation intensity), and pre-conditioning (dry vs. pre-hydrated <b>primary</b> <b>particles)</b> on the aggregate growth rate were systematically investigated. An optimum stoichiometric ratio of the <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> was found in each case. The structure of the resulting hetero-aggregates was characterised by laser scanning confocal microscopy and found to strongly depend on the pre-conditioning of the <b>primary</b> <b>particles.</b> While dry <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> resulted in open, floccular structures, pre-hydrated <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> gave rise to relatively dense, compact aggregates.

5000|$|The {{secondary}} electrons {{produced during}} the process of ionization by the primary charged particle are conventionally called delta rays, if their energy is large enough so that they themselves can ionize.

This energy limit is meant to exclude secondary electrons that carry energy far from the <b>primary</b> <b>particle</b> track, since a larger energy implies a larger range. This approximation neglects the directional distribution of secondary radiation and the non-linear path of delta rays, but simplifies analytic evaluation.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{suspension}} pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) suffer {{not only}} from delivering small amounts of a drug to the lungs, but also the inhaled dose scatters all over the lung regions. This results in much less of the desired dose being delivered to regions of the lungs. This study aimed to improve the aerosol performance of suspension pMDIs by producing <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> with narrow size distributions. Inkjet spray drying was used to produce respirable particles of salbutamol sulfate. The Next Generation Impactor (NGI) {{was used to determine}} the aerosol particle size distribution and fine particle fraction (FPF). Furthermore, oropharyngeal models were used with the NGI to compare the aerosol performances of a pMDI with monodisperse <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> and a conventional pMDI. Monodisperse <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> in pMDIs showed significantly narrower aerosol particle size distributions than pMDIs containing polydisperse <b>primary</b> <b>particles.</b> Monodisperse pMDIs showed aerosol deposition on a single stage of the NGI as high as 41. 75 [*]±[*] 5. 76 %, while this was 29. 37 [*]±[*] 6. 79 % for a polydisperse pMDI. Narrow size distribution was crucial to achieve a high FPF (49. 31 [*]±[*] 8. 16 %) for <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> greater than 2 [*]µm. Only small polydisperse <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> with sizes such as 0. 65 [*]±[*] 0. 28 [*]µm achieved a high FPF with (68. 94 [*]±[*] 6. 22 %) or without (53. 95 [*]±[*] 4. 59 %) a spacer. Oropharyngeal models also indicated a narrower aerosol particle size distribution for a pMDI containing monodisperse <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> compared to a conventional pMDI. It is concluded that, pMDIs formulated with monodisperse <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> show higher FPFs that may target desired regions of the lungs more effectively than polydisperse pMDIs.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{morphology}} on the radiative properties of fractal soot aggregates was investigated using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). The optical properties of four {{different types of}} aggregates of freshly emitted soot with a fractal dimension Df= 1. 65 and a fractal pre-factor kf= 1. 76 were calculated. The four types of aggregates investigated are formed by uniform <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> in point-touch, by uniform but overlapping <b>primary</b> <b>particles,</b> by uniform but enlarged <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> in point-touch, and formed by point-touch and polydisperse <b>primary</b> <b>particles.</b> The radiative properties of aggregates consisting of N= 20, 56 and 103 <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> were numerically evaluated for a given refractive index at 0. 532 and 1. 064 3 ̆bcm.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is developed to describe aggregative crystal growth, including oriented aggregation, from evolving pre-existing primary nanoparticles with composition and structure {{that are different}} from that of the final crystalline aggregate. The basic assumptions of the model are based on the ideas introduced in an earlier published report [Buyanov and Krivoruchko, Kinet.

It is assumed that <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> can be described as pseudo-species A, B, and C, which have the following properties: (1) fresh <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> (colloidally stable inert nanoparticles, denoted as A), (2) mature <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> (partially transformed nanoparticles at an optimum stage of development for attachment to a growing crystal, denoted as B), and (3) nucleated <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> (denoted as C 1). The evolution of <b>primary</b> <b>particles,</b> A → B → C 1, is treated as two first-order consecutive reactions. Crystal growth via crystal−crystal aggregation (Ci +) is described using the Smoluchowski equation. The new element of this model is the inclusion of an additional crystal growth mechanism via the addition of <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> (B) to crystals (Ci) : (B +). Two distinct, but constant, kernels (K ≠ K‘) are used. It is shown that, when K‘ = 0, a steplike crystal size distribution (CSD) is obtained. Within a range of K‘/K values (e. g., K‘/K = 103), CSD with multiple peaks are obtained. Comparison with predictions of models that do not include the intermediate stage of <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> (B) indicates pronounced differences. Despite its simplicity, the model is able to capture the qualitative features of CSD evolution that have been obtained from crystal growth experiments in hematite, which is a system that is believed to undergo oriented aggregation...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} answer these questions, it is of {{particular}} interest to investigate cosmic rays in the 1012 to 1015 eV region due to several theories predicting a change in elemental composition just below the knee. To determine the elemental spectrum of cosmic rays, CREAM uses a silicon charge detector, timing charge detector, and scintillating fiber hodoscopes to detect the charge of incident particles up to that of iron (Z = 26). Energies are measured with a transition radiation detector (TRD), along with an ionization calorimeter. Because all detectors are in close proximity of each other, it is a prime concern to minimize the interaction between showers produced in the calorimeter, and the charge-measuring instruments. To dampen this effect, CREAM uses a larger number of pixels with a smaller area, along with a very fast readout time to differentiate between events caused by the <b>primary</b> <b>particle</b> and events caused by back-scattering from the calorimeter.|$|E

Ziegler led a program of work at IBM which culminated in the publication of a number of papers (Ziegler and Lanford, 1979) demonstrating that cosmic rays also could cause soft errors. Indeed, in modern devices, cosmic rays may be the predominant cause. Although the <b>primary</b> <b>particle</b> of the cosmic ray does not generally reach the Earth's surface, it creates a shower of energetic secondary particles. At the Earth's surface approximately 95% of the particles capable of causing soft errors are energetic neutrons with the remainder composed of protons and pions.IBM estimated in 1996 that one error per month per 256 MiB of ram was expected for a desktop computer.This flux of energetic neutrons is typically referred to as [...] "cosmic rays" [...] in the soft error literature. Neutrons are uncharged and cannot disturb a circuit on their own, but undergo neutron capture by the nucleus of an atom in a chip. This process may result in the production of charged secondaries, such as alpha particles and oxygen nuclei, which can then cause soft errors.|$|E

40|$|Pre-coagulation {{and then}} {{flocculation}} with/without sedimentation before ultrafiltration (CSUF/CUF) {{was compared to}} explore the process for treating synthetic humic rich water and controlling membrane fouling. The sedimentation process caused larger flocs to be removed and zeta potential of the remaining flocs to be more negative. Also the fractal dimension of flocs became smaller after sedimentation process. All the data seemed to suggest that sedimentation process can improve the membrane fouling. On the contrary, the development of trans-membrane pressure (TMP) in CSUF surprisingly increased higher than that in CUF. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of cake layer {{on the surface of}} membrane showed that the size of nano-scale <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> formed in coagulation process was heterogeneous. It also showed that the flocs formed by larger nano-scale <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> were removed by sedimentation process, and the smaller nano-scale <b>primary</b> <b>particles</b> in CSUF maybe the crucial reason causing higher development of TMP. The density of cake layer on the CUE membrane surface with larger nanoscale particles was much lower than that by CSUF. Therefore, the characteristic of flocs, especially the size of nano-scale <b>primary</b> <b>particles,</b> may be the main factor inducing higher increase of TMP in CSUF, which should be explored in the future.
