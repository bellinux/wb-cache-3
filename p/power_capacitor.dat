It is also the main noise source difficult to control. Presently in the world, there are none explicit requirement and regulation on the evaluation and measurement of the noise generated by the <b>power</b> <b>capacitor,</b> which has seriously restricted the development of the further research on the noise control in <b>power</b> <b>capacitor.</b> So the research on the noise measurement method and technology has extremely important significance in scientifically evaluating the noise of <b>power</b> <b>capacitor.</b> <b>Power</b> <b>capacitor</b> in HVDC Converter Station under practical conditions has apparent fundamental frequency and rich harmonic frequency components. In order to simulate this condition, a whole condition loaded bridge circuit of noise measurement on <b>power</b> <b>capacitor</b> has been designed and studied. Two arms of the bridge are used to load fundamental frequency and a parallel resonance compensation inductance is used to reduce the fundamental current, while the other two arms are used to load harmonic frequency. The harmonic frequency load power supply composed of harmonic signal generator and power amplifier which can simultaneously load any combination of harmonics under 48 th to simulate the various actual working conditions. The tests indicated that the noise spectrum measured under the designed circuit completely accorded with the one in HVDC Converter Station...|$|E

In recent years dielectric materials used in the <b>power</b> <b>capacitor</b> has been greatly improved together with its design and manufacturing process, making the size, weight and power loss of the capacitor considerably small. On the other hand, the material used in the series reactor and therefore, the design concept of the reactor has been much less improved, so the size, weight and power loss of the series reactor has been essentially unchanged. Now the balance of these values between the <b>power</b> <b>capacitor</b> and the series reactor is lost when considering the difference of their apparent capacity.

40|$|Denna rapport innehåller en utredning av effektflöden på Uddevalla Energi Elnät AB:s mottagningsstationer och optimering av driftläggning för dess effektkondensatorbatterier och {{transformator}}er. Uddevalla Energi Elnät AB har sedan 30 år haft effektkondensatorbatterier inkopplade nästan hela året och dessa behöver av åldersskäl snart bytas ut. Uddevalla Energi Elnät AB har därför behov av nya rutiner för driftläggning av effektkondensatorbatterier efter det att Svenska Kraftnät och Vattenfall AB har infört nya regler för de reaktiva effektflödena i elnätet. I utredningen om effektkondensatorbatterier har det gjorts en investeringskalkyl med tre alternativ för inköp. Alternativ 1 med central faskompensering på mottagningsstation, alternativ 2 med faskompensering på mottagningsstation kompletterat med faskompensering på abonnentstationer och alternativ 3 med lokal faskompensering på abonnentstationer.   Det framkom i utredningen att alternativ 2 : Central faskompensering kompletterat med faskompensering på abonnentstationer är mest lämplig att genomföra.    Det har tidigare konstaterats att det under delar av året har varit låg belastning på några av mottagningsstationernas transformatorer. Det har aldrig utretts om det är lönsamt att stänga av den ena transformatorn under hela eller delar av året. I utredningen om driftläggning av transformatorerna på mottagningsstationerna har det beaktats tre alternativ. Ett alternativ innebär att en transformator körs i tomgång utan last och ett alternativ med en helt avstängd transformator. Det tredje alternativet är att inte göra någon förändring. I utredningen framkom det att det mest lämpliga är att inte göra någon förändring eftersom riskerna med avstängning är större än den ekonomiska vinsten på c:a 101000 SEK. This report {{contains a}} study of power flows in Uddevalla Energi AB receiving stations and optimization of the operation control of its <b>power</b> <b>capacitor</b> batteries and transformers. For the past thirty years, Uddevalla Energi AB has employed <b>power</b> <b>capacitor</b> batteries almost all year around and these need soon to be replaced due to ageing. Uddevalla Energi Elnät AB {{has a need for}} new procedures for the operation control of the <b>power</b> <b>capacitor</b> batteries following new regulations introduced by Svenska Kraftnät and Vattenfall AB for reactive power flows on the grid. In the study of <b>power</b> <b>capacitor</b> batteries, there has been an investment calculation with three alternative purchase options. Option one is central phase compensation at the receiving station, option two is phase compensation at the receiving station supplemented with phase compensation at subscriber stations and option three is a local phase compensation at subscriber stations. The investment calculation shows that the second option: Central phase compensation supplemented with phase compensation at subscriber stations is the most favourable to implement. It has previously been found that, during certain times of the year, there has been a low load on some of the transformers of the receiving stations. It has never been investigated if it is profitable to turn off one of the transformer for the entire, or part of the year. In the investigation of the operation control of the transformers at the receiving stations, three alternatives have been considered. One alternative is that one transformer is in idle operation without load, the second alternative is that one transformer is completely turned off. The third alternative is to make no change. The study showed that the preferred alternative is to make no change, because the risks of turning off transformers are greater than the economic gain, that is approximately 101000 SEK...|$|E

The modern fuze {{technology}} puts forward {{higher and}} higher requirements of the fuze power, especially the fast feature of supplying <b>power.</b> <b>Capacitor</b> energy storage power whose energy is from the setter can supply power for fuze before launching the projectile, but its energy is little, so it couldn’t satisfy the energy for the fuze work. The turbine alternator can generate power in all the trajectory, so its energy is enough, but it has the hysteresis characteristics of the start-up.

Polydiacrylate-BaTiO 3 films with filler loadings of 10 vol% to 30 vol% and controlled thickness of 5 - 30 μ m were achieved by optimizing spray conditions of spray liquid flow rate, atomizing gas pressure and substrate traverse speed and temperature. Microstructural investigations showed well-dispersed BaTiO 3 nanoparticles embedded in the polydiacrylate matrix. Dielectric constants of ∼ 39 at 10 kHz, high breakdown strengths of > 100 kV/mm and low leakage currents of 1 0 - 9 to 1 0 - 8 A/cm 2 above 1000 V, and thermal stability up to 150 °C were attained for PTPGDA- 30 vol%BaTiO 3 films.
