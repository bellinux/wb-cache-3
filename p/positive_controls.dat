5|$|Holocaust deniers {{claim that}} Zyklon B gas {{was not used}} in the gas chambers, relying for {{evidence}} on the research of Fred A. Leuchter, who found low levels of Prussian blue in samples of the gas chamber walls and ceilings. Leuchter attributed its presence to general delousing of the buildings. Leuchter's negative control, a sample of gasket material taken from a different camp building, had no cyanide residue. In 1999, James Roth, the chemist who had analyzed Leuchter's samples, stated that the test was flawed because the material that was sent for testing included large chunks, and the chemical would only be within 10 microns of the surface. The surface that {{had been exposed to}} the chemical was not identified, and the large size of the specimens meant that any chemical present was diluted by an undeterminable amount. In 1994, the Institute for Forensic Research in Kraków re-examined Leuchter's claim, stating that formation of Prussian blue by exposure of bricks to cyanide is not a highly probable reaction. Using microdiffusion techniques, they tested 22 samples from the gas chambers and delousing chambers (as <b>positive</b> <b>controls)</b> and living quarters (as negative controls). They found cyanide residue in both the delousing chambers and the gas chambers but none in the living quarters.|$|E

5000|$|The Z-factor based QC {{criterion}} is popularly used in HTS assays. However, it {{has been}} demonstrated that this QC criterion is most suitable for an assay with very or extremely strong <b>positive</b> <b>controls.</b> [...] In an RNAi HTS assay, a strong or moderate positive control is usually more instructive than a very or extremely strong positive control because {{the effectiveness of this}} control is more similar to the hits of interest. In addition, the <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> in the two HTS experiments theoretically have different sizes of effects. Consequently, the QC thresholds for the moderate control should be different from those for the strong control in these two experiments. Furthermore, it is common that two or more <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> are adopted in a single experiment. [...] Applying the same Z-factor-based QC criteria to both controls leads to inconsistent results as illustrated in the literatures.|$|E
40|$|Respirable {{crystalline}} silica was classified by IARC (1997) as human carcinogen. However, as different polymorphs react differently in lungs, assays {{are needed for}} differentiation. The objective of this 90 -day study was to characterize differences in biological activity between two quartz species, ground quartz particles (well-characterized <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> DQ 12) versus a quartz-containing material (geologically ancient Quartz Isolate from bentonite). Total doses of 15. 2 mg/kg body weight of the <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> and Quartz Isolate were administered to rats by intratracheal instillation. Controls received saline only. Bronchoalveolar lavagate analysis showed that, relative to the controls, the total leukocyte counts at 3 days were significantly elevated in both the Quartz Isolate and <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> groups. At 28 and 90 days, the Quartz Isolate values were no longer statistically different from the control values whereas the corresponding <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> values were about 12 and 65 times greater than control values. At 3, 28 and 90 days, the percentages of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were 18 %, 25 % and 32 % for the Quartz Isolate group and 39 %, 45 % and 46 % for the <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> group, respectively. Histopathologically, the Quartz Isolate group showed moderate effects compared to controls after 28 days with no progression of severity at 90 days. In contrast, the <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> group exhibited more severe effects at 28 days and a progression in intensity at 90 days. In conclusion, in the <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> group, a persistent inflammation (interstitial fibrosis, alveolar lipoproteinosis) was observed. Conclusions: i) Controls did not induce lung inflammation ii) The <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> produced significant and progressive lung inflammation. iii) The Quartz Isolate induced a significantly weaker inflammatory response than the <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> (not progressive). From a regulatory point of view, these substance-specific toxicological effects of Quartz Isolate {{may need to be}} considered for its classification...|$|R

Thus, these <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> treatments confirmed that the test compounds were ingested and that the test system is able to detect treatment effects. The inclusion of <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> (or reference) treatments is an important factor to consider in ecotoxicological studies [10 – 12].|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 294 nursery pigs (PIC TR 4 × 1050, {{initially}} 15. 2 lb, 3 d postweaning) {{were used in}} a 28 -d trial to evaluate the effects on growth performance of eliminating specific crystalline amino acids from a low-CP, amino acid-fortified diet. On d 3 after weaning, pigs were allotted to 1 of 6 dietary treatments. A 2 -phase diet series was used, with treatment diets fed from d 0 to 14 and a common diet fed from d 14 to 28. All diets were in meal form. The formulation was {{based on data from}} previous trials in which fish meal was replaced with crystalline amino acids in the diet for 15 - to 25 -lb pigs. The objective of this trial was to determine which amino acids are required in this low-CP, amino acid-fortified diet. The <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> diet contained L-lysine HCl, DL-methionine, L-threonine, L-isoleucine, L-tryptophan, L-valine, L-glutamine, and L-glycine. The 6 treatments were (1) <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> (2) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> with L-isoleucine deleted from the diet, (3) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> with L-tryptophan deleted, (4) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> L-valine deleted, (5) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> with L-glutamine and L-glycine deleted, and (6) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> with L-isoleucine, L-tryptophan, L-valine, L-glutamine, and L-glycine deleted from diet (negative control). There were 7 pigs per pen and 7 pens per treatment. Pigs and feeders were weighed on d 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 to calculate ADG, ADFI, and F/G. From d 0 to 14, pigs fed the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> diet had improved (P 0. 40) ADG, ADFI, and F/G to pigs fed the <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> but had improved (P 0. 12) ADG to the <b>positive</b> <b>control.</b> There were no differences (P > 0. 10) in ADFI from d 14 to 28. Because of the decrease in ADG from d 0 to 14, pigs fed the negative control or diets without L-tryptophan or L-valine had decreased (P < 0. 04) ADG for the overall trial (d 0 to 28) compared to pigs fed the <b>positive</b> <b>control.</b> ADFI from all treatment diets decreased compared to the <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> although only the negative control group tested significantly (P 0. 24) in F/G for the overall data. In conclusion, L-tryptophan and L-valine were needed in the low-CP, high amino acid-fortified nursery diet to achieve maximum growth performance from 15 to 25 lb. This suggests that the tryptophan:lysine and valine:lysine requirements are greater than 15 and 57 % of lysine, respectively. The numerical decrease in performance when L-glutamine and L-glycine were removed from the diet during the first period suggests a need for nonessential nitrogen in the low-CP, amino acid-fortified diet or a benefit to one of these amino acids separate from its role as a nitrogen source...|$|R

5000|$|Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is a {{platelet}} inhibitor {{that causes}} {{an increase in}} cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in platelets by stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity. cAMP is an intracellular signaling molecule, {{and the increase in}} cAMP inhibits calcium mobilization and platelet aggregation induced by activation of the ADP receptor P2Y1. Activation of the P2Y1 receptor initiates platelet aggregation in response to ADP. The P2Y1 receptor is required for ADP-induced platelet activation, but is not sufficient for a full platelet aggregation in response to ADP.cAMP inhibits platelet aggregation, and decreased amounts of cAMP in platelets lead to platelet aggregation. [...] The PGE1 reagent is used together with the ADP test for two purposes: the assessment of ADP high sensitivity (HS) and of <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> of the ADPtest. When a small amount of PGE1 (20 µl) is added to the ADPtest, it induces a moderat inhibition of aggregation in normal samples, but greatly increases the sensitivity of platelets to inhibition by clopidogrel. This is why the modified test is called [...] "High Sensitivity".Adding 50 µl of PGE1 to the ADPtest leads to a strong inhibition of ADP induced aggregation, and is used for assessment of <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> of the ADPtest.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{high-throughput}} screen (HTS), {{quality control}} (QC) is critical.

This QC characteristic can be evaluated using the comparison of two well types in HTS assays. Signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), signal-to-background ratio (S/B), and Z-factor have been adopted to evaluate the quality of HTS assays through the comparison of two investigated types of wells.

40|$|In a {{study on}} bioassay-directed {{chemical}} factionation of sediment extracts, problems were encountered using benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) as a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> in the Mutatox™ bacterial genotoxicity assay. Genotoxic responses of tests with this compound, prescribed by the Mutatox supplier, could only be measured using supersaturated concentrations that exceeded its aqueous solubility more than 250 times. Additional to three obvious requirements for a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> of this test system (it should demonstrate that the bacteria are alive and grow after reconstitution, that the bacteria are mutated, and that the bacteria emit light), a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> should meet two criteria: the metabolic routes of genotoxic response induction for <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> and test compound(s) should be identical, and test concentrations (of both <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> and test compound) should be at environmentally relevant concentrations, i. e., below the aqueous solubilities. As BaP does not meet this last criterion, it does not fully qualify as a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> in testing genotoxicity of solutes with the Mutatox assay. Testing of other unsubstituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHS) did not yield another PAH as choice for <b>positive</b> <b>control.</b> Furthermore, {{the results of our}} study imply that calculating the bioavailability of BaP from the aqueous solubility alone is not sufficient, as this tends to underestimate the amount of BaP available to either the S 9 enzyme system or the bacteria, whereas the interference between toxic and genotoxic effects hampered the interpretation of test results, as variations in toxicity may be interpreted as variations in genotoxicity. Quantitative S 9 -mediated genotoxicity assessments using the Mutatox test appeared difficult to make, as the two parameters that are proposed by the supplier (CMR, concentration of maximum genotoxic response, and LOEC, lowest observable [genotoxic] effect concentration) showed significant dependency on the sensitivity of the S 9 system toward the test compound (CMR) or the initial test compound concentration (LOEC...|$|R
