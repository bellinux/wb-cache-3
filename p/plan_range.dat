In 1910, Frederick Parker (later of Parker Knoll fame) invited him to join his firm, which made furniture at workshops in High Wycombe, the 'furniture capital' of England. Though he was living at 27 Claremont Road, Walthamstow in 1911 census with his largely Italian-born family, including future TV cabinet manufacturer brother Victor. In 1912, Ercolani took up a part-time appointment at High Wycombe Technical School, teaching furniture design to evening classes which were attended by High Wycombe’s furniture makers. It was here that he met Edward Gomme, son of a High Wycombe chair-maker. At the outbreak of World War I, Ercolani joined E Gomme Ltd., chair-makers (whose G <b>Plan</b> <b>range</b> of furniture enjoyed considerable success in the 1950s and 1960s). As Ercolani recorded in his biography: “At Gomme’s … it seemed to me … that the simple chair was the outcome of very good and precise workmanship.” ...|$|E

Let ṘṖ^d⊆R⃗P⃗^d denote the set of optimal-proposed response plans in terms of dimension d. Let R̂P̂^d denote {{the assessment of the}} theoretical optimal response plan, and let ŘP̌^d denote the assessment of the theoretical worst response plan in terms of dimension d.

40|$|The Stone House is a {{property}} owned and {{maintained by the}} non-profit organization stone circles located in Mebane, NC. The organization’s mission is to “sustain activists and strengthen the work of justice through spiritual practice and principles. ” They are committed to ensuring that their 70 acres of land benefit the local community, regional ecosystem, and the global environmental movement. The purpose of this master’s project {{was to create a}} land use and conservation plan for stone circles that incorporates the organization’s many visions for the site, as well as recommends sources of funding to reduce current management costs. To this end, the staff of stone circles helped us to identify their needs and limitations by posing questions that ultimately shaped how the plan addressed the following issues: (1) the management of onsite vegetation and wildlife habitat, (2) the expansion of organic food production, (3) the establishment of an educational trail system, (4) onsite stormwater management with particular attention toward erosion control, and (5) feasibility, costs, and funding of various management scenarios. Several land use and funding options were explored for the stone circles property including: obtaining a conservation easement, using the back field as a wetland mitigation bank, using the field as a solar farm, leasing land for long-term residential use, leasing the field for agricultural use, and implementing the conservation and stormwater management plans that were developed. The conservation management plan involves permaculture improvements to the orchard, facilitating reforestation of the back field, installing a trail network, and the developing educational materials for onsite visitors. The recommended option for stone circles at this time is to implement the conservation and stormwater management plans. There are numerous funding streams available to assist in financing these plans, including governmental programs, grants, carbon offsets, and timber sales. A grant we have specifically applied for is the Rudolf Steiner Foundation Seed Grant. The estimated costs of the conservation management plan include: Reforestation: $ 0 - $ 9, 450 Trail: $ 13, 500 - $ 99, 000 (conservative estimate) Signs: $ 72 - $ 1, 350 In terms of stormwater management, the estimated costs for the plan include: Purchase of four rain barrels: $ 216 - $ 480 Installing one rain garden: $ 4, 000 - $ 6, 000 Improving riparian buffers: $ 0 - $ 7, 600 Paving the road with a permeable grassy paver: $ 65, 000 (paving materials alone) Implementing best management practices for the road: $ 10, 000 (roadbed materials alone) Total costs to implement the conservation management <b>plan</b> <b>range</b> from $ 72 to $ 109, 800 and the cost of implementing the stormwater management <b>plan</b> <b>range</b> from $ 0 to over $ 79, 000 depending on which portions stone circles decides to implement and at what scale...|$|E
