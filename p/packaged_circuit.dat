40|$|Additive Manufacturing (AM) {{processes}} {{can facilitate}} the rapid iterative product development of electronic devices by optimising their design and functionality. This {{has been achieved}} by combining two additive manufacturing processes with conventional surface mount assembly to generate high resolution embedded multilayer electronic circuits contained within a 3 D printed polymer part. Bottom-up DLP Stereolithography and material dispensing of isotropic conductive adhesives have been interleaved to deposit microscale features on photopolymer substrates. The material dispensing process has demonstrated the high density deposition of conductors attaining track widths of 134 µm and produced interconnects suitable for directly attaching bare silicon die straight to the substrate. Interconnects down to a diameter of 149 µm at a pitch of 457 µm have been realized. In addition, this research developed a novel method for producing high aspect ratio z-axis connections. These were simultaneously printed with the circuit and component interconnects by depositing through-layer pillars with a maximum aspect ratio of 3. 81. Finally, a method to accurately embed the <b>packaged</b> <b>circuit</b> layer within the printed part has been employed using bottom-up stereolithography...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{reports on}} the {{development}} of a novel simulation method aimed at modelling power distribution noise generated in digital CMOS integrated circuits. The simulation method has resulted in new information concerning: 1. The magnitude and nature of the power distribution noise and its dependence on the performance and electrical characteristics of the packaged integrated circuit. Emphasis is laid on the effects of resistive, capacitative and inductive elements associated with the <b>packaged</b> <b>circuit.</b> 2. Power distribution noise associated with a generic systolic array circuit comprising 1, 020, 000 transistors, of which 510, 000 are synchronously active. The circuit is configured as a linear array which, if fabricated using two-micron bulk CMOS technology, would be over eight centimetres long and three millimetres wide. In principle, the array will perform 1. 5 x 10 to the power of 11 operations per second. 3. Power distribution noise associated with a non-array-based signal processor which, if fabricated in 2 -micron bulk CMOS technology, would occupy 6. 7 sq. cm. The circuit contains about 900, 000 transistors, of which 600, 000 are functional and about 300, 000 are used for yield enhancement. The processor uses the RADIX- 2 algorithm and is designed to achieve 2 x 10 to the power of 8 floating point operations per second. 4. The extent to which power distribution noise limits the level of integration and/ or performance of such circuits using standard and non-standard fabrication and packaging technology. 5. The extent to which the predicted power distribution noise levels affect circuit susceptibility to transient latch-up and electromigration. It concludes the nature of CMOS digital integrated circuit power distribution noise and recommends ways in which it may be minimised. It outlines an approach aimed at mechanising the developed simulation methodology so that the performance of power distribution networks may more routinely be assessed.

40|$|Abstract- A novel fully micromachined {{coplanar}} waveguide (CPW) to rectangular waveguide transition {{is presented in}} this paper. A metalized probe is adopted to couple the signal from the CPW to the rectangular waveguide through an aperture located {{at the center of}} the bottom broad wall of the rectangular waveguide. The transition was optimized using HFSS 10 over the whole W-band. In the proposed transition, the CPW and the rectangular waveguide are patterned and integrated on the same side ofthe substrate, while the coupling probe is patterned on the substrate instead of being fabricated separately. These changes make the transition more suitable for RF <b>packaged</b> <b>circuits</b> and easily extendable to THz applications.
