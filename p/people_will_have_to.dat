2500|$|The {{interpretation}} {{of these findings}} has been criticized by Daniel Dennett, who argues that <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> shift their attention from their intention to the clock, and that this introduces temporal mismatches between the felt experience of will and the perceived position of the clock hand. Consistent with this argument, subsequent {{studies have shown that}} the exact numerical value varies depending on attention. Despite the differences in the exact numerical value, however, the main finding has held. Philosopher Alfred Mele criticizes this design for other reasons. Having attempted the experiment himself, Mele explains that [...] "the awareness of the intention to move" [...] is an ambiguous feeling at best. For this reason he remained skeptical of interpreting the subjects' reported times for comparison with their 'Bereitschaftspotential'.|$|E

There was hardly any increase allowed for the services which went to build up the life of the people, education and health. Everything was devoted to piling up the instruments of death.

One would think to listen to him that the Government had no responsibility for the state of world affairs....The Government has now resolved to enter upon an arms race, and the <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay for their mistake in believing that it could be trusted to carry out a policy of peace....

2500|$|Sarkar {{therefore}} advocates {{an economic}} democracy where the decision-making {{power for the}} economic future of a community is given to its inhabitants. Economic democracy {{is not a new}} term, but Sarkar reinvents it by setting four requirements for what he considers a successful one. [...] The first and foremost requirement is guaranteeing the minimum requirements of life to all members of society. Secondly, and following one of the five fundamental principles, PROUT argues that there should be an increasing purchasing capacity for each individual, stating that local <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hold economic power over their socio-economic region. Still, on this regard, Sarkar theorizes that, unlike capitalism, where the production and distribution of goods are mainly decided by market competition, in a proutistic society it should be based on necessity [...] The third requirement of economic democracy is the decentralization of power, giving the freedom to make economic decisions to its stakeholders. That can be accomplished by adopting a worker-owned cooperative system [...] and by the use of local resources (raw materials and other natural resources) {{for the development of the}} region and not merely for export [...] In summary, PROUT advocates a decentralized economy where self-sufficient economic zones are created and organized according to a set of predetermined conditions (see socio-economic units) [...]„ ... a local economy using local resources in a climate which fosters local initiative and industriousness for the collective welfare." [...] PROUT also indicates that outsiders must be kept out from interfering with the local economy [...] From a proutistic perspective, this requirement does not express xenophobic feelings, it solely claims to be the realization that there should not be a constant outflow of local capital, where natural resources are explored by foreign investment companies that extract assets and money out of the community [...] From a Neo-humanistic perspective, all people are free to choose where they wish to live, as long as they merge their economic interests with the ones of the local people.“ In law, we grant individual rights only to the extent that they do not harm others. Prout includes this idea in economics. “ ...|$|E
