5|$|After 150 {{million years}} of volcanism, <b>plutonism,</b> metamorphism, and thrust {{faulting}} had run their course, {{the early part}} of the Cenozoic era (early Tertiary, 6530 Ma) was a time of repose; neither igneous nor sedimentary rocks of this age are known here. A relatively featureless plain was created from erosion over many millions of years. Deposition resumed some 35 Ma in the Oligocene epoch on a flood plain that developed in the area; sluggish streams migrated laterally over the surface, laying down cobbles, sand, and mud. Outcrops of the resulting conglomerates, sandstone, and mudstone of the Titus Canyon Formation can be observed in road cuts at Daylight Pass on Daylight Pass Road, which becomes State Route 374 a short distance from the pass. Several other similar formations were also laid down.|$|E
5|$|In Darwin's {{second year}} at the {{university}} he joined the Plinian Society, a student natural-history group featuring lively debates in which radical democratic students with materialistic views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science. He assisted Robert Edmond Grant's investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of marine invertebrates in the Firth of Forth, and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech. One day, Grant praised Lamarck's evolutionary ideas. Darwin was astonished by Grant's audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus' journals. Darwin was rather bored by Robert Jameson's natural-history course, which covered geology – including the debate between Neptunism and <b>Plutonism.</b> He learned the classification of plants, and assisted with work on the collections of the University Museum, {{one of the largest}} museums in Europe at the time.|$|E
25|$|Through {{observation}} and carefully reasoned geological arguments, Hutton {{came to believe}} that the Earth was perpetually being formed; he recognised that the history of the Earth could be determined by understanding how processes such as erosion and sedimentation work in the present day. His theories of geology and geologic time, also called deep time, came to be included in theories which were called <b>plutonism</b> and uniformitarianism. Some of his writings anticipated the Gaia hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Hutton's {{main line}} of {{argument}} was that the tremendous displacements and changes he was seeing did not happen {{in a short period}} of time by means of catastrophe, but that the incremental processes of uplift and erosion happening on the Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, in order to allow time for the changes to occur. While his ideas of <b>Plutonism</b> were hotly contested, scientific inquiries on competing ideas of catastrophism pushed back the age of the Earth into the millions of years – still much younger than commonly accepted by modern scientists, but a great change from the literalist view of an Earth that was only a few thousand years old.|$|E
25|$|Quickly {{after the}} lunar crust formed, {{or even as}} it was forming, {{different}} types of magmas that would give rise to the Mg-suite norites and troctolites began to form, although the exact depths at which this occurred are not known precisely. Recent theories suggest that Mg-suite <b>plutonism</b> was largely confined to {{the region of the}} Procellarum KREEP Terrane, and that these magmas are genetically related to KREEP in some manner, though their origin is still highly debated in the scientific community. The oldest of the Mg-suite rocks have crystallization ages of about 3.85 Ga. However, the last large impact that could have excavated deep into the crust (the Imbrium basin) also occurred at 3.85 Ga before present. Thus, it seems probable that Mg-suite plutonic activity continued for a much longer time, and that younger plutonic rocks exist deep below the surface.|$|E
500|$|The {{first phase}} of {{regional}} <b>plutonism</b> started 210 million {{years ago in the}} late Triassic and continued throughout the Jurassic to about 150 million years before present (BP). Around the same time, the Nevadan orogeny built the Nevadan mountain range (also called the Ancestral Sierra Nevada) to a height of [...] This was directly part of the creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith, and the resulting rocks were mostly granitic in composition and emplaced about [...] below the surface. The second major pluton emplacement phase lasted from about 120 million to 80 million years ago during the Cretaceous. This was part of the Sevier orogeny.|$|E
2500|$|Darwin {{also took}} the popular natural history course of Professor Robert Jameson, {{learning}} about stratigraphic geology. Jameson was a Neptunian geologist who taught that strata had precipitated from a universal ocean: he held debates with chemistry professor Thomas Charles Hope who held that granites had crystallised from molten crust, ideas {{influenced by the}} <b>Plutonism</b> of James Hutton who had been Hope's friend. Jameson's view was that [...] "It would be a misfortune if we all had the same way of thinking... Dr Hope is decidedly opposed to me, and I am opposed to Dr Hope, and between us we make the subject interesting." [...] Darwin liked Hope and found Jameson a boring speaker. It is not known what he made of Jameson's closing lectures on the [...] "Origin of the Species of Animals". Darwin enjoyed practicals in the Museum and course field trips, learning the sequence of strata. The Museum of Edinburgh University was Jameson's preserve and was {{then one of the}} largest in Europe. Darwin assisted and made full use of the collections, spending hours studying, taking notes and stuffing animal specimens.|$|E
2500|$|Uniformitarianism {{held the}} field against the {{competitor}} theories of Neptunism and catastrophism, which partook of Romantic science and theological cosmogony; it established {{itself as the}} successor of <b>Plutonism,</b> and became the foundation of modern geology. Its tenets were correspondingly firmly held. Charles Lyell put forward at one point views on what were called [...] "uniformity of kind" [...] and [...] "uniformity of degree" [...] that were incompatible with what was argued later. Lyell's theory, in fact, was of a [...] "steady state" [...] geology, which he deduced from his principles. This went too far in restricting actual geological processes, to a predictable closed system, if it ruled out ice ages (see ice ages#Causes of ice ages), as became clearer not long after Lyell's Principles of Geology appeared (1830–3). Of Lubbock's three types of change, the geographical included the theory of migration over land bridges in biogeography, which in general acted as an explanatory stopgap, rather than in most cases being one supported by science. Sea level changes were easier to justify.|$|E

50|$|The {{evidence}} for the Acadian orogeny is abundant and widespread in the northern Appalachians, recorded by the <b>plutonism</b> and the migration of the northern Appalachian deformation front toward the craton. In the central to southern Appalachians, {{evidence for}} the Acadian orogeny is poor, and is found primarily in the <b>plutonism</b> of the Blue Ridge and metamorphism of the Cat Square terrane.|$|E
5000|$|Anton Lazzaro Moro (1687 in San Vito al Tagliamento [...] - [...] 1764) was an Italian abbot, {{geologist}} and naturalist. He {{was one of}} {{the leading}} advocates of <b>plutonism</b> in the early debate that confronted <b>plutonism</b> to neptunism, making him described by some authors as an ultraplutonist. He was the first to discriminate sedimentary rocks from volcanic ones by studying the rocks of volcanic islands. In his study of the crustaceans, he discovered fossils petrified in mountains that led him to deduce those rocks were once buried in the sea.|$|E
5000|$|Angular unconformities {{had been}} noted by earlier geologists who {{interpreted}} {{them in terms}} of Neptunism as [...] "primary formations", so Hutton wanted to examine such formations himself to look for support for his theory of <b>Plutonism.</b>|$|E
50|$|The term {{originated}} from Pluto, the classical {{god of the}} underworld. The use of the name and concept {{goes back to the}} beginnings of the science of geology in the late 18th century and the then hotly debated theories of <b>plutonism</b> (or vulcanism), and neptunism regarding the origin of basalt.|$|E
50|$|The range {{consists}} {{mainly of}} intrusive rocks (Upper Cretaceous-Paleocene granite, granitoid and diorite) {{that were made}} in the Laramide orogeny in the Late Cretaceous-Early Paleocene. Mount Alvand is located in the Sanandaj-Sirjan geological and structural zone. Sanadaj-Sirjan was subjected to magmatism and metamorphism in the Paleozoic and Mesozoic. This section along with other Iranian microplates were separated from Gondwana in the Carboniferous (when magmatism was caused by rifting and the process of detachment) and moved northwards. From the Early Jurassic to the Middle Miocene Sandaj-Sirjan was adjacent to a subduction zone and there was magmatism because of the subduction zone which was situated in the south and south-west of this structural zone. Consequently, in the Late Cretaceous-Early Paleocene, Sanandaj-Sirjan region was subjected to the magmatism of the Laramide orogeny in the form of both volcanism and <b>plutonism.</b> Mount Alvand was formed {{as a result of the}} <b>plutonism</b> of this orogenic phase.|$|E
50|$|Made chiefly of Eocene {{extrusive}} and intrusive rocks, Jebal Barez mountain {{chain is}} situated in {{what is called the}} Central Iranian Range, the Sahand-Bazman volcanic range or belt, a mountain range which was formed mainly during Eocene volcanism and <b>plutonism</b> and that stretches approximately from Sahand Volcano in the north-west of Iran to Bazman Volcano in the south-east of Iran.|$|E
50|$|The first {{sequence}} was {{deposited in}} the Jurassic during the rifting which caused the initial formation of the basin. This Jurassic formation is called the Girón Group which consists of siltstones and rhyolitic tuffs. During this period, the basin also experienced granitic <b>plutonism</b> along its western margins. The Jurassic-Cretaceous angular unconformity, separating {{the first and second}} sequence, is representative of the post-rift boundary.|$|E
50|$|Today, the Grenville orogen {{is marked}} by {{northwest}} verging fold-and-thrust belts and high pressure metamorphic regimes, as well as distinctive AMCG suite magmatism. Metamorphism is commonly of amphibolite and granulite facies, that is, medium to high temperature and pressure alteration. Eclogitized metagabbros (very high pressure ultramafic metamorphic rocks) are found in some localities, and likely represent areas of deepest burial and/or most intense collision. Throughout the orogen, these sequences of high pressure metamorphic rocks are cut by intrusive AMCG suite plutons, generally interpreted as syn- or post-tectonic. AMCG <b>plutonism</b> is generally associated with asthenospheric upwelling under thinned lithosphere. This {{is derived from the}} theory that AMCG <b>plutonism</b> is driven by ponding of olivine tholeiite basalt {{at the base of the}} continental crust during tectonic extension. The lithosphere may be thinned either convectively or by delamination, in which the bottom portion of the lithosphere is stripped off. Both models have been proposed for the Grenville orogeny.|$|E
50|$|The theory {{took its}} name from Neptune, the ancient Roman god of the sea. There was {{considerable}} debate between its proponents (Neptunists) and those favouring a rival theory known as <b>plutonism</b> which gave a significant role to volcanic origins, and which in modified form replaced neptunism in the early 19th century as the principle of uniformitarianism was shown to fit better with the geological facts as they became better known.|$|E
50|$|A rival theory {{known as}} <b>plutonism</b> (or vulcanism) held that rocks were formed in fire. This was {{originally}} proposed by Abbé Anton Moro (1687-1750) {{with reference to}} his studies of volcanic islands, and was taken up by James Hutton who put forward a uniformitarian theory of a rock cycle extending over infinite time in which rocks were worn away by weathering and erosion, then were re-formed and uplifted by heat and pressure.|$|E

50|$|Geologically, Shir Kuh is made chiefly of Jurassic granite {{surrounded}} by Cretaceous rocks. It is located almost {{in the vicinity}} of the Sahand-Bazman volcanic arc, a volcanic arc that was formed during the Tertiary and mainly in the Eocene volcanism. Shir Kuh consists mainly of intrusive rocks (Jurassic granite) that were made in the Late Cimmerian orogeny in the Late Jurassic. This mountain is located in the Sanandaj-Sirjan geological and structural zone. Sanadaj-Sirjan was subjected to magmatism and metamorphism in the Paleozoic and Mesozoic. This section along with other Iranian microplates were separated from Gondwana in the Carboniferous (when magmatism was caused by rifting and the process of detachment) and moved northwards. From the Early Jurassic to the Middle Miocene Sandaj-Sirjan was adjacent to a subduction zone and there was magmatism because of the subduction zone which was situated in the south and south-west of this structural zone. Consequently, in the Late Jurassic, Sanandaj-Sirjan region was subjected to the magmatism of the Late Cimmerian orogeny in the form of both volcanism and <b>plutonism.</b> Shir Kuh was formed as a result of the <b>plutonism</b> of this orogenic phase.|$|E
50|$|The Hook massif is bounded to {{the south}} by the Mwembeshi dislocation, a Pan-African transcurrent shear zone. Syntectonic {{rhyolite}} intruded in this shear zone dates to 551±19 Ma, so the transcurrent shearing happened {{about the same time}} as the batholith intrusion and was probably due to the same causes.Syntectonic and post-tectonic granite <b>plutonism</b> also took place around the same time in the Damara belt in Namibia, indicating a link with the Lufilian arc and Zambezi belt during the Pan-African orogeny.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first phase}} of {{regional}} <b>plutonism</b> started 210 million {{years ago in the}} late Triassic and continued throughout the Jurassic to about 150 million years BP. Also starting 150 million years ago was an increase in the westward drift rate of the North American Plate. The resulting orogeny (mountain-building event) is called the Nevadan orogeny by geologists. The resulting Nevadan mountain range (also called the Ancestral Sierra Nevada) was 15,000 feet (4500 m) high and was made of sections of seafloor and mélange.|$|E
50|$|Field {{studies and}} U-Pb (uranium-lead) dating {{show that the}} massif is a large {{composite}} batholith that has intruded into the upper Katangan (Kundelungu) strata of sediments in the Lufilian arc during or after tectonic activity.Sample U-Pb dates for syntectonic granite in the massif are 559±18 and 566±5 Ma, and for post-tectonic granite 533±3 Ma.These show that the Kundelungu sediments date to before 570 Ma; the deformation of the inner Lufilian arc and voluminous syntectonic granite <b>plutonism</b> took place around 560-570 Ma; and the major tectonic activity had ended by around 530-540 Ma.|$|E
50|$|The Bronson Hill Island Arc is a bimodal {{volcanic}} terrane {{and associated}} sediments that {{are thought to}} have docked with Laurentia (North American) during the Ordovician, (ca 450 Ma) to create the Taconic Orogeny. These rocks are presently well exposed along the Connecticut River Valley of Vermont and New Hampshire. The arc is evidenced by <b>plutonism</b> and extrusive volcanics including the Ammonoosuc Formation (ca. 461 Ma from U/Pb zircon dates) and the overlying Partridge Formation (ca. 457 Ma from graptolites in the Partridge Fm.). The docked island arc has been metamorphosed and deformed during the Acadian Orogeny and the Alleghenian Orogeny.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Plutonism</b> (or volcanism) is the {{geologic}} {{theory that}} the igneous rocks forming the Earth originated from intrusive magmatic activity, with a continuing gradual process of weathering and erosion wearing away rocks, which were then deposited on the sea bed, re-formed into layers of sedimentary rock by heat and pressure, and raised again.

50|$|With {{regards to}} the {{geological}} evidence, this event was of compressional nature. This tectonic phase is represented by {{significant changes in the}} sedimentary environments, <b>plutonism,</b> and metamorphism (e.g., west of Central Iran, south of Central Alborz, Lut). The Sahand-Bazman volcanic arc or belt was mainly formed during the Eocene volcanism of the Alpine orogeny. The northern movement and the final collision of Afro-Arabia (significantly the Arabian Plate) with the Iranian Plate and the clockwise rotation of the Eurasian Plate towards the Iranian Plate caused the Alpine orogeny with the Pyrenean phase in the Late Eocene- Early Oligocene and the Styrian phase in the Middle Miocene respectively. The Zagros, Alborz, and Kopet-Dagh mountains were mainly formed in the Miocene during this orogenic phase.|$|E
5000|$|Early geologists such as Nicolas Steno (1638-1686) and Horace-Bénédict de Saussure (1740-1799) had {{developed}} ideas of geological strata forming from water through chemical processes, which Abraham Gottlob Werner (1749-1817) {{developed into a}} theory known as Neptunism, envisaging the slow crystallisation of minerals in the ancient oceans of the Earth to form rock. Hutton's innovative 1785 theory, based on <b>Plutonism,</b> visualised an endless cyclical process of rocks forming under the sea, being uplifted and tilted, then eroded to form new strata under the sea. In 1788 the sight of Hutton's Unconformity at Siccar Point convinced Playfair and Hall of this extremely slow cycle, and {{in that same year}} Hutton memorably wrote [...] "we find no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end".|$|E
