There were observed the most represented weed species on <b>permanent</b> grass <b>growth</b> in ZD Třebelovice. Mostly, the land sorrel and dandelion medical Hinoki were found.

50|$|Yippee-like 3 (Drosophila) is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the YPEL3 gene. YPEL3 has growth {{inhibitory}} effects in normal and tumor cell lines.

Initially discovered in a gene expression profiling assay of p53 activated MCF7 cells, induction of YPEL3 {{has been shown to}} trigger <b>permanent</b> <b>growth</b> arrest or cellular senescence in certain human normal and tumor cell types. DNA methylation of a CpG island near the YPEL3 promoter as well as histone acetylation may represent possible epigenetic mechanisms leading to decreased gene expression in human tumors.|$|E

When growth begins to break that balance, as we see with global warming, we can no longer speak of it as development, but rather, the deterioration and destruction of our home. A certain level of growth and industrialization is needed to satisfy basic needs and guarantee the human rights of a population, but this level of “necessary development” is not about <b>permanent</b> <b>growth,</b> but rather, balance among humans and with nature.|$|E
50|$|Aaronson's early {{research}} {{established the}} transformation-competent but replication-defective nature of mammalian sarcoma viruses and molecularly cloned {{many of their}} oncogenes. His investigations of the v-sis oncogene established the first normal function of an oncogene {{and its role in}} growth factor signaling. His discovery of erbB2 as a v-erbB-related gene amplified in a human breast carcinoma and the demonstration of its transforming properties paved the way for targeted therapies directed against its product, and his successful isolation of KGF (FGF7), a growth factor present in the epithelialization-phase of wound healing, led to Amgen's successful phase III clinical trial and FDA approval of KGF for treatment of mucositis.

In the monitored period from 2001 till 2007, the soil organic mass markedly fell off. The greatest decline was in the forest ecosystem in all researched basins. Decline of organic soil karbon content was also found on <b>permanent</b> grass <b>growth,</b> but it was much less than in the forests. On the contrary mild improvement turns out on the arable land. Next pH value of soil leach was monitored. The greatest change was shown in the forests. The greatest increase of PH value was at the area of Pasecký potok.

40|$|Traditional {{empirical}} {{strategies for}} studying convergence - more generally, the dynamics and determinants of economic growth, {{can be misleading}} if important, underlying <b>permanent</b> or <b>growth</b> components are stochastically time-varying. This paper documents {{the degree to which}} this instability characterises the data, and then offers an alternative empirical framework. This alternative, directly modelling the dynamics of the evolving cross-section distributions, applied to cross-country income data yields some interesting insights: economies across the world seem to be converging to a distribution where many remain wealthy, and many remain poor. Those economies able to make the transition from low to high income levels are primarily small and sparsely populated; middle-income ones, by contrast, are a vanishing class. ...|$|R
