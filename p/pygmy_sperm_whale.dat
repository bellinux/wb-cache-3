5|$|The {{sperm whale}} {{belongs to the}} order Cetartiodactyla, the order {{containing}} all cetaceans and even-toed ungulates. It {{is a member of}} the unranked clade Cetacea, with all the whales, dolphins, and porpoises, and further classified into Odontoceti, containing all the toothed whales and dolphins. It is the sole extant species of its genus, Physeter, in the family Physeteridae. Two species of the related extant genus Kogia, the <b>pygmy</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> Kogia breviceps and the dwarf sperm whale K. simus, are placed either in this family or in the family Kogiidae. In some taxonomic schemes the families Kogiidae and Physeteridae are combined as the superfamily Physeteroidea (see the separate entry on the sperm whale family).|$|E
5|$|Whales are {{a widely}} {{distributed}} and {{diverse group of}} fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), {{are thought to have}} split apart around 34 million years ago. The whales comprise eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and <b>pygmy</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whale),</b> and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).|$|E
25|$|Dolphins {{are highly}} social animals, often living in pods {{of up to}} a dozen individuals, though pod sizes and {{structures}} vary greatly between species and locations. In places with a high abundance of food, pods can merge temporarily, forming a superpod; such groupings may exceed 1,000 dolphins. Membership in pods is not rigid; interchange is common. Dolphins can, however, establish strong social bonds; they will stay with injured or ill individuals, even helping them to breathe by bringing them to the surface if needed. This altruism {{does not appear to}} be limited to their own species. The dolphin Moko in New Zealand has been observed guiding a female <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Sperm</b> <b>Whale</b> together with her calf out of shallow water where they had stranded several times. They have also been seen protecting swimmers from sharks by swimming circles around the swimmers or charging the sharks to make them go away.|$|E
40|$|Stomach {{contents}} {{were analyzed}} of six <b>pygmy</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> (Kogia breviceps) and five dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> (Kogia sima) which were taken as by-catch or were stranded specimens in coast al Taiwan from 1998 through 2000. Twenty-t wo species in 12 families of oceanic cephalopods were identified. In pygmy sp erm whales, Enoploteuthis chunii, Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis, and Taonius pavo {{were the primary}} prey in the diet, while E. chunii, Histioteuthis miranda, and T. pavo {{were the most important}} prey items ingested by dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whales.</b> Although the primary p rey items these two species ingested were very similar, each item comprised a different proportion for each whale species. A similarity test demonstrated a significant difference in prey composition, and SIMPER analysis showed that E. chunii was ranked first and contributed 37. 1 % to the average dissimilarity between <b>pygmy</b> and dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whales.</b> <b>Pygmy</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> fed on much larger T. pavo compared to those ingested by dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whales,</b> while dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> ingested more H. miranda than did <b>pygmy</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales.</b> These results support the view that <b>pygmy</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> live seaward of the continental shelf and that dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> live more in coastal waters.

5000|$|<b>Pygmy</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> are {{normally}} either solitary, or found in pairs, [...] {{but have been}} seen in groups up to six. Dives have been estimated to last an average of 11 minutes, although longer dives up to 45 minutes have been reported. The ultrasonic clicks of <b>pygmy</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> range from 60 to 200 kHz, peaking at 125 kHz, and the animals also make much lower-frequency [...] "cries" [...] at 1 to 2 kHz.|$|R
40|$|<b>Pygmy</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> are {{distributed}} throughout deep waters {{and along the}} continental slopes of the North Pacific and other ocean basins (Ross 1984; Caldwell and Caldwell 1989). Along the U. S. west coast, sightings of this species and of animals identified only as Kogia sp. have been very rare (Figure 1). However, this is probably a reflection of their pelagic distribution, small body size and cryptic behavior, rather than an indication of true rareness.

500|$|The {{sperm whale}} (Physeter macrocephalus) or {{cachalot}} [...] {{is the largest}} of the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator.

500|$|The {{traditional}} {{view has}} been that Mysticeti (baleen whales) and Odontoceti (toothed whales) arose from more primitive whales early in the Oligocene period, and that the super-family Physeteroidea, which contains the sperm whale, dwarf sperm whale, and <b>pygmy</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whale,</b> diverged from other toothed whales soon after that, over [...] From 1993 to 1996, molecular phylogenetics analyses by Milinkovitch and colleagues, based on comparing the genes of various modern whales, suggested that the sperm whales are {{more closely related to}} the baleen whales than they are to other toothed whales, which would have meant that Odontoceti were not monophyletic; in other words, it did not consist of a single ancestral toothed whale species and all its descendants. However, more recent studies, based on various combinations of comparative anatomy and molecular phylogenetics, criticised Milinkovitch's analysis on technical grounds and reaffirmed that the Odontoceti are monophyletic.|$|E
500|$|White sharks also attack {{dolphins}} and porpoises from above, behind {{or below}} {{to avoid being}} detected by their echolocation. Targeted species include dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops ssp.), Humpback dolphins (Sousa ssp.), harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), and Dall's porpoises (Phocoenoides dalli). Groups of dolphins have occasionally been observed defending themselves from sharks with mobbing behaviour. White shark predation on other species of small cetacean has also been observed. In August 1989, a [...] juvenile male <b>pygmy</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> (Kogia breviceps) was found stranded in central California with a bite mark on its caudal peduncle from a great white shark. In addition, white sharks attack and prey upon beaked whales. Cases where an adult Stejneger's beaked whale (Mesoplodon stejnegeri), with a mean mass of around , and a juvenile Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris), an individual estimated at , were hunted and killed by great white sharks have also been observed. When hunting sea turtles, they appear to simply bite through the carapace around a flipper, immobilizing the turtle. The heaviest species of bony fish, the oceanic sunfish (Mola mola), {{has been found in}} great white shark stomachs.|$|E
500|$|These {{analyses}} also {{confirm that}} there was a rapid evolutionary radiation (diversification) of the Physeteroidea in the Miocene period. The Kogiidae (dwarf and <b>pygmy</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales)</b> diverged from the Physeteridae (true <b>sperm</b> <b>whales)</b> at least [...]|$|R

40|$|The dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> {{appears to}} be {{distributed}} worldwide in temperate to tropical waters (Caldwell and Caldwell 1989). Sightings of these animals in the northern Gulf of Mexico occur primarily in oceanic waters (Figure 1; Mullin et al. 1991; Mullin and Fulling 2004). Dwarf <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> and <b>pygmy</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> (Kogia breviceps) are difficult to differentiate at sea, and sightings of either species are usually categorized as Kogia spp. Sightings of this category were documented in all seasons during GulfCet aerial surveys of the northern Gulf of Mexico from 1992 to 1998 (Hansen et al. 1996; Mullin and Hoggard 2000). The difficulty in sighting dwarf and <b>pygmy</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whales</b> may be exacerbated by their avoidance reaction towards ships, and change in behavior towards approaching survey aircraft (Würsig et al. 1998). In a study using hematological and stable-isotope data, Barros et al.

50|$|Although firm details {{concerning}} <b>pygmy</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> reproduction are limited, {{they are}} believed to mate from April to September in the southern hemisphere.

50|$|Debate {{exists as}} to the correct {{classification}} of the pygmy and dwarf sperm whales (see sperm whale family for details).

The <b>pygmy</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whale</b> was first named by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1838.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{the dwarf}} sperm whale is {{generally}} classified as one of two species, along with the <b>pygmy</b> <b>sperm</b> <b>whale,</b> in the family Kogiidae and genus Kogia.
