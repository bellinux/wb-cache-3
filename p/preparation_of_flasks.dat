50|$|Typically, before solvent or {{reagents}} {{are introduced}} into a Schlenk flask, the flask is dried {{and the atmosphere}} <b>of</b> the <b>flask</b> is exchanged with an inert gas. A common method of exchanging the atmosphere <b>of</b> the <b>flask</b> is to flush the flask out with an inert gas. The gas can be introduced through the side arm <b>of</b> the <b>flask,</b> or via a wide bore needle (attached to a gas line). The contents <b>of</b> the <b>flask</b> exit the flask through the neck portion <b>of</b> the <b>flask.</b> The needle method has the advantage that the needle can be placed at the bottom <b>of</b> the <b>flask</b> to better flush out the atmosphere <b>of</b> the <b>flask.</b> Flushing a flask out with an inert gas can be inefficient for large flasks and is impractical for complex apparatus.|$|R

50|$|Special {{electrically}} powered heating mantles {{are available in}} various sizes into which the bottoms <b>of</b> round-bottom <b>flasks</b> can fit so that the contents <b>of</b> a <b>flask</b> can be heated for distillation, chemical reactions, boiling, etc. Heating can also be accomplished by submerging the bottom <b>of</b> the <b>flask</b> into a heat bath, water bath, or sand bath.

40|$|The {{production}} and circulation <b>of</b> <b>flasks</b> <b>of</b> different shapes, generally considered as perfume or ointments containers, is largely attested during the 3 rd millennium BC, particularly in Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia. Some peculiar flask types are attested over wide areas, suggesting that these vessels circulated {{far from the}} core manufacturing areas, probably traded as luxury goods due to their valuable content. This is true, in particular, for the so-called Syrian Bottles, characterized by the round, ovoid or piriform body shape and the pointed or rounded base. Beside Syrian Bottles other contemporary types of unguentaria are the flattened or ring-base flasks, which show a different geographical distribution, only partially overlapping the distribution area of Syrian Bottles. This paper examines the typology, chronology and distribution of 3 rd millennium B. C. flat and ring-base <b>flasks.</b> The problem <b>of</b> the possible use <b>of</b> <b>flasks</b> is addressed: the discussion makes use of morphometric analyses, contextual data and textual references...|$|R

Some interactions were found between sample volume and receiver volume (at lower volumes, the use of smaller receiver volumes is overproportionally worse) and between sample volume and use <b>of</b> pipettes or <b>flasks</b> (at lower volumes, the use <b>of</b> <b>flasks</b> is overproprotionally worse than the use of pipettes).|$|R
