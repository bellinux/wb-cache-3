40|$|Abstract—Patient summary {{documents}} provide crucial infor-mation about a patient, like {{allergies and}} adverse reactions, which {{are necessary for}} an efficient and safe treatment and offer a quick overview of the patients health status. Automatically generating <b>patient</b> <b>summaries</b> from Electronic Health Records (EHR) reduces the workload of medical personnel. Nevertheless, existing approaches do not take several challenges that occur in live operation into account. Based on a health standard-compliant approach, a system for on-demand generation of <b>patient</b> <b>summaries</b> was implemented and evaluated using real data. This work shows several problems which could be identified. Those problems are not covered sufficiently by current research. Possible approaches to a solution are suggested, which have to be further investigated in future work. Keywords—patient summary, IHE, e-Health, ELGA, epSOS I...|$|R

40|$|Context High-quality cancer {{care should}} be {{accessible}} for patients and healthcare professionals. Involvement of patients as partners in guideline formation and consensus processes is still rarely found. EURECCA, short for European Registration of Cancer Care, is the platform to improve outcomes of cancer care by reducing variation in the diagnostic and treatment process. EURECCA acknowledges {{the important role of}} patients in implementation of consensus information in clinical practice. Objective The aim {{of this article is to}} describe the process of involving patients in the consensus process and in developing the <b>patient</b> <b>summary</b> of the consensus for colon and rectal cancer care. Methods The Delphi method for achieving consensus was used. Three online voting rounds and one tele-voting round were offered to an expert panel of oncology professionals and patient representatives. At four different stages, patients and/or patient representatives were involved in the process: (1) during the consensus process, (2) lecturing about the role of the patient, (3) development of the <b>patient</b> <b>summary,</b> and (4) testing the <b>patient</b> <b>summary.</b> Results Representatives were invited to the voting and commenting rounds of this process and given an equal vote. Although patients were not consulted during the planning stages of this process, patient involvement increased following the panel's discussion of the implementation of the consensus among the patient population. After the consensus meeting, the <b>patient</b> <b>summary</b> was written by patient representatives, oncologists and nurses. A selection of proactive patients reviewed the draft patient summary; responses were positive and several patient-reported outcomes were added. Questionnaires to evaluate the use and implementation of the <b>patient</b> <b>summary</b> in daily practice are currently being developed and tested. Patient consultation will be needed in future planning for selection of topics. Discussion The present study may function as a model for future consensus processes to involve patients at different stages and to implement both patient and healthcare professional versions in daily practice...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Academic {{emergency}} department (ED) handoffs are high-risk transfer of care events. Emergency medicine residents are inadequately trained to handle these vital transitions. We {{aimed to explore}} what modifications the I-PASS (illness severity, <b>patient</b> <b>summary,</b> action list, situation awareness and contingency plans, and synthesis by receiver) handoff system requires to be effectively modified for use in ED inter-shift handoffs. METHODS: This mixed-method needs assessment conducted at an academic ED explored the suitability of the I-PASS system for ED handoffs. We conducted a literature review, focus groups, and then a survey. We sought to identify the distinctive elements of ED handoffs and discern how these could {{be incorporated into the}} I-PASS system. RESULTS: Focus group participants agreed the <b>patient</b> <b>summary</b> should be adapted to include anticipated disposition of patient. Participants generally endorsed the order and content of the other elements of the I-PASS tool. The survey yielded several wording changes to reflect contextual differences. Themes from all qualitative sources converged to suggest changes for brevity and clarity. Most participants agreed that the I-PASS tool would be well suited to the ED setting. CONCLUSION: With modifications for context, brevity, and clarity, the I-PASS system may be well suited for application to the ED setting. This study provides qualitative data in support of using the I-PASS tool and concrete suggestions for how to modify the I-PASS tool for the ED. Implementation and outcome research is needed to investigate if the I-PASS tool is feasible and improves patient outcomes in the ED environment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{explored}} {{the use of}} virtual patient generated data by investigating the association between students 2 ̆ 019 unprofessional <b>patient</b> <b>summary</b> statements, which they entered during an on-line virtual patient case, and detection of their future unprofessional behavior. Method At the USUHS, students complete a number of virtual patient encounters, including a <b>patient</b> <b>summary,</b> to meet the clerkship requirements of Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, and Pediatrics. We reviewed the summary statements of 343 students who graduated in 2012 and 2013. Each statement was rated with regard to four features: Unprofessional, Professional, Equivocal (could be construed as unprofessional), and Unanswered (students did not enter a statement). We also combined Unprofessional and Equivocal into a new category to indicate a statement receiving either rating. We then examined the associations of students 2 ̆ 019 scores on these categories (i. e. whether received a particular rating or not) and Expertise score and Professionalism score reflected by a post-graduate year one (PGY- 1) program director (PD) evaluation form. The PD forms contained 58 Likert-scale items designed to measure the two constructs (Expertise and Professionalism). Results The inter-rater reliability of statements coding was high (Cohen 2 ̆ 019 s Kappa 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 009. 97). The measure of receiving an Unprofessional or Equivocal rating was significantly correlated with lower Expertise score (r 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0092 ̆ 212. 19, P 2 ̆ 009 < 2 ̆ 009. 05) as well as lower Professionalism score (r 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0092 ̆ 212. 17, P 2 ̆ 009 < 2 ̆ 009. 05) during PGY- 1.
