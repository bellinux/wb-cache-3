These halos {{are produced by}} the same horizontally oriented ice crystals that produce sun dogs and the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle.</b> [...] They result from multiple interior reflections of sun rays entering the hexagonal top face and leaving through the bottom face.|$|E
500|$|The {{white spot}} on the lower left part of the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle,</b> {{opposite}} to the sun, should be an anthelion, a bright halo always located at the antisolar point. [...] Most scientists are convinced anthelia are caused by the convergence of several halo arcs (of which are no traces in the painting) and thus should not be regarded as an independent halo. [...] Other researchers believe column-shaped crystals could generate the phenomenon which could explain the constellation in the painting.|$|E
500|$|In the painting, {{the actual}} sun is the yellow {{ball in the}} upper-right corner {{surrounded}} by the second circle. [...] The large circle taking {{up most of the}} sky is a <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle,</b> parallel to the horizon and located at the same altitude as the sun, as the painting renders it. [...] This is actually a common halo, although a full circle as depicted is rare. [...] Such parhelic circles are caused by horizontally oriented plate ice crystals reflecting sun rays. [...] In order for a full circle to appear sun rays must be reflected both internally and externally.|$|E
50|$|Even {{fractions}} of <b>parhelic</b> <b>circles</b> are less common than sun dogs and 22° halos. While <b>parhelic</b> <b>circles</b> are generally white in colour {{because they are}} produced by reflection, they can however show a bluish or greenish tone near the 120° parhelia and be reddish or deep violet along the fringes.|$|R
50|$|Artificial <b>parhelic</b> <b>circles</b> can be {{realized}} by experimental means using for instance spinning crystals.|$|R
50|$|An infralateral arc (or lower lateral tangent arc) {{is a rare}} halo, {{an optical}} {{phenomenon}} appearing similar to a rainbow under a white <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle.</b> Together with the supralateral arc they are always located outside the seldom observable 46° halo, but in contrast to supralateral arcs, infralateral arcs are always located below the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle.</b>|$|E

50|$|The subhelic arc {{crosses the}} <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> in an acute angle, {{and at a}} sun {{elevation}} of 27° it passes exactly through the 120° parhelion.|$|E
50|$|The anthelic {{point is}} often used as a synonym for the antisolar point, but the two should be differentiated.While the antisolar point is {{directly}} opposite the sun, always below the horizon {{when the sun is}} up, the anthelic point is opposite but at the same elevation as the sun, and is therefore located on the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle.</b> There are several halo phenomena that are centered on or converge on the anthelic point, such as the anthelion, Wegener arcs, Tricker arcs and the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> itself.|$|E
50|$|Parhelic circles form as {{beams of}} {{sunlight}} are reflected by vertical or almost vertical hexagonal ice crystals. The reflection {{can be either}} external (e.g. without the light passing through the crystal) which contributes to the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> near the sun, or internal (one or more reflections inside the crystal) which creates much of the circle away from the sun. Because {{an increasing number of}} reflections makes refraction asymmetric some colour separation occurs away from the sun. Sun dogs are always aligned to the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> (but not always to the 22° halo).|$|E

5000|$|An {{anthelion}} (plural anthelia, {{from late}} Greek ανθηλιος, [...] "opposite the sun") {{is a rare}} optical phenomenon appearing on the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> opposite to the sun as a faint white halo, not unlike a sundog.|$|E

50|$|A <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> is a halo, {{an optical}} {{phenomenon}} appearing as a horizontal white {{line on the}} same altitude as the sun, or occasionally the Moon. If complete, it stretches all around the sky, but more commonly it only appears in sections.|$|E
5000|$|The Disney/Pixar {{animated}} movie The Good Dinosaur (2015) {{contains many}} scenes with photorealistic scenery, including several atmospheric optical phenomena such as rainbows and halos. One scene shows {{what appears to}} be a prominent right-hand sundog along with the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> running through it.|$|E
50|$|The subparhelic {{circle is}} a rare halo, an optical {{phenomenon}} located below the horizon. It passes through both the subsun, below the sun, and the antisolar point, opposite to the sun. The subparhelic circle is the subhorizon counterpart to the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> located above the horizon.|$|E
50|$|A 120° parhelion (plural: 120° parhelia) is a {{relatively}} rare halo, an optical phenomenon occasionally appearing along with very bright sun dogs (also called parhelia) when ice crystal-saturated cirrus clouds fill the atmosphere. The 120° parhelia are named for appearing in pair on the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> ±120° from the sun.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A halo display photo {{documented}} by Cindy McFee, NOAA, December 1980 at the South Pole Station. Several distinct halo phenomena are {{featured in the}} photo: Two sun dogs (bright spots), a <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> (horizontal line), a 22° halo (circle), and an upper tangent arc and a Parry arc (top).|$|E
50|$|How anthelions {{are formed}} is disputed. Walter Tape, among others, has argued {{they are not}} {{separate}} haloes, but simply where various haloes caused by horizontally oriented column-shaped ice crystals coincide on the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> to create a bright spot. If this theory is correct, anthelia should only appear together with these other haloes.|$|E
50|$|When visible, 120° parhelia {{appear as}} white-bluish bright {{spots on the}} white <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> and {{are the product of}} at least two {{interior}} reflections in the hexagonal ice crystals. Their colour together with them being rather obscure can make observing them difficult as they tend to fuse with the clouds in the sky.|$|E
50|$|Sun {{dogs are}} red-colored {{at the side}} nearest the Sun; farther out the colors grade through oranges to blue. However, the colors overlap {{considerably}} and so are muted, never pure or saturated. The colors of the sun dog finally merge into {{the white of the}} <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> (if the latter is visible).|$|E
50|$|Finally, the minor, {{slightly}} bluish dots, {{flanking the}} anthelion, may be perfectly depicted 120° parhelia. These halos {{are produced by}} the same horizontally oriented ice crystals that produce sun dogs and the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle.</b> They result from multiple interior reflections of sun rays entering the hexagonal top face and leaving through the bottom face.|$|E
50|$|While the {{anthelion}} area {{is usually}} sparse on haloes, {{in a complex}} display it features various rare optic phenomena: Flanking the anthelion on the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> are two 120° parhelia (and two Liljequist parhelia) caused by plate crystals. The Tricker and diffuse arcs are produced in singly oriented column crystals and form an Ankh-like shape passing through the anthelion. Wegener arcs occasionally crosses the sky to converge in the anthelion.|$|E
5000|$|The {{intensity}} {{distribution of the}} <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> is largely dominated by 1-3-2 and 1-3-8-2 rays (cf. the nomenclature by W. Tape, i.e. 1 denotes the top hexagonal face, 2 the bottom face, and 3-8 enumerate the side faces in counter-clockwise fashion. A ray is notated by the sequence in which it encounters the prism faces). The former ray-path {{is responsible for the}} blue spot halo which occurs at an azimuth ...|$|E
5000|$|A 46° halo {{is a rare}} {{member of}} the family of ice crystal halos, {{appearing}} as a large ring centred on the Sun at roughly twice the distance as the much more common 22° halo. At solar elevations between 15-27°, the 46° halo is often confused with the less rare and more colourful supralateral and infralateral arcs, which cross the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> at about 46° to the left and right of the sun.|$|E
50|$|The {{white spot}} on the lower left part of the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle,</b> {{opposite}} to the sun, should be an anthelion, a bright halo always located at the antisolar point. Most scientists are convinced anthelia are caused by the convergence of several halo arcs (of which are no traces in the painting) and thus should not be regarded as an independent halo. Other researchers believe column-shaped crystals could generate the phenomenon which could explain the constellation in the painting.|$|E
5000|$|While the sun {{touches the}} horizon, a Liljequist parhelion is located {{approximately}} 160° {{from the sun}} and is about 10° long. As the sun rises up to 30° the phenomenon gradually moves towards 150°, and as the sun reaches over 30° the optical effect vanishes. The parhelia are caused by light rays passing through oriented plate crystals. [...] Like the 120° parhelia, the Liljequist parhelia display a white-bluish colour. This colour is, however, associated with the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> itself, not the ice crystals causing the Liljequist parhelia.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{sun rises}} higher, the rays passing through the {{crystals}} are increasingly skewed from the horizontal plane. Their angle of deviation increases and the sundogs move further from the sun. [...] However, they always stay at the same elevation as the sun. Sun dogs are red-colored at the side nearest the sun. Farther out the colors grade to blue or violet. [...] However, the colors overlap considerably and so are muted, rarely pure or saturated. The colors of the sun dog finally merge into {{the white of the}} <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> (if the latter is visible).|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{experimental studies}} on halo phenomena {{have been attributed}} to Auguste Bravais in 1847. Bravais used an equilateral glass prism which he spun around its vertical axis. When illuminated by parallel white light, this produced an artificial <b>Parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> and many of the embedded parhelia. Similarly, A. Wegener used hexagonal rotating crystals to produce artificial subparhelia. In a more recent version of this experiment, many more embedded parhelia have been found using commercially available hexagonal BK7 glass crystals. Simple experiments like these can be used for educational purposes and demonstration experiments. Unfortunately, using glass crystals one cannot reproduce the circumzenithal arc or the circumhorizontal arc due to total internal reflections preventing the required ray-paths when [...]|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the static 46° halo, {{the shape of a}} supralateral arc varies with the elevation of the sun. Before the sun reaches 15°, the bases of the arc touch the [...] (oriented sidewise) sides of the 46° halo. As the sun rises from 15° to 27°, the supralateral arc almost overlaps the upper half of the 46° halo, which is why many reported observations of the latter most likely are observations of the former. As the sun goes from 27° to 32°, the apex of the arc touches the circumzenithal arc centered on zenith (as does the 46° halo when the sun is located between 15° and 27°). In addition, the supralateral arc is always located above the <b>parhelic</b> <b>circle</b> (the arc located below it is the infralateral arc), and is never perfectly circular.|$|E
