40|$|Despite {{the huge}} {{resources}} invested in <b>fire</b> <b>suppression,</b> {{the impact of}} wildfires has considerably increased across the Mediterranean region since {{the second half of}} the 20 th century. Modulating <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> efforts in mild weather conditions is an appealing but hotly-debated strategy to use unplanned fires and associated fuel reduction to create opportunities for <b>suppression</b> of large <b>fires</b> in future adverse weather conditions. Using a spatially-explicit fire–succession model developed for Catalonia (Spain), we assessed this opportunistic policy by using two <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> strategies that reproduce how firefighters in extreme weather conditions exploit previous fire scars as firefighting opportunities. We designed scenarios by combining different levels of <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> efficiency and climatic severity for a 50 -year period (2000 – 2050). An opportunistic <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> policy induced large-scale changes in fire regimes and decreased the area burnt under extreme climate conditions, but only accounted for up to 18 – 22 % of the area to be burnt in reference scenarios. The area suppressed in adverse years tended to increase in scenarios with increasing amounts of area burnt during years dominated by mild weather. Climate change had counterintuitive effects on opportunistic <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> strategies. Climate warming increased the incidence of large fires under uncontrolled conditions but also indirectly increased opportunities for enhanced <b>fire</b> <b>suppression.</b> Therefore, to shift <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> opportunities from adverse to mild years, we would require a disproportionately large amount of area burnt in mild years. We conclude that the strategi...|$|R

40|$|A 35 -year {{controlled}} burning experiment in Minnesota oak savanna showed that fire frequency {{had a great}} impact on ecosystem carbon (C) stores.

Forest floor carbon stores were also significantly impacted by fire frequency, but there were no detectable effects of <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> on carbon in soil and fine roots combined, or in woody debris. Total ecosystem C stores averaged ∼ 110 Mg/ha in stands experiencing presettlement fire frequencies, but ∼ 220 Mg/ha in stands experiencing <b>fire</b> <b>suppression.</b> If comparable rates of C storage were to occur in other ecosystems in response to the current extent of <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> in the United States, <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> in the USA might account for 8 – 20 % of missing global carbon...|$|R
40|$|Without {{large-scale}} {{implementation of}} fire hazard reduction treatments, {{the costs of}} uncharacteristic crown fires in southwest forests will continue to increase. Federal policy continues to allocate vastly more funds to suppression than to prefire hazard reduction. We examined the economic rationality of continuing this policy of emphasizing <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> activities over restoration-based fire hazard reduction treatments. We compared treatment plus <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> costs {{to the cost of}} <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> without treatments over 40 years for southwestern forests. This avoided-cost analysis estimates the amount one could invest in treatments to avoid the future cost of <b>fire</b> <b>suppression.</b> Using conservative economic values, we found that avoided future costs justifies spending $ 238 - 601 /ac for hazard reduction treatments in the southwest. We conclude that the policy of underfunding hazard reduction treatments dows not represent rational economic behavior, because funding hazard reduction would pay for itself by lowering future <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> costs...|$|R

30|$|Fire {{management}} in the US northern Rockies can be separated into three consecutive time periods (Rollins et al. 2001, Hessburg and Agee 2003). Early in the century (1900 to 1934), <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> was limited and poorly organized until fires in 1910 and in the decades following galvanized funding and training for <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> (Hessburg and Agee 2003). In the mid twentieth century (1935 to 1973), <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> became increasingly effective, fueled by military technology and the 10 AM policy implemented in 1935, which emphasized aggressive <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> everywhere (Pyne et al. 1996). Aerial fire detection and <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> by smokejumpers were initiated in 1950 at bases in the region, and local crews were numerous and well equipped (Pyne et al. 1996). Late in the century (1974 to present), as part of intentional land management, some fires were not aggressively suppressed, particularly in federally designated wilderness and adjacent remote areas (Pyne et al. 1996).|$|R

40|$|Halons {{have been}} used in {{aircraft}} as <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> agents since the first integrated <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> systems were introduced in aircraft. However, research in the mid 1970 ’s discovered that halon gasses contribute substantially to the depletion of the Ozone layer, so in 1994 the Montreal Protocol banned it usage in all industries, excluding the Aerospace and Defence. However, halon is now no longer manufactured and existing stocks are becoming depleted. In the EU Horizon 2020 Cleansky 2 - ‘Cargo <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> system project’ EFFICIENT, an international consortium, including London South Bank University (LSBU), is investigating the potential of alternative <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> agents to eliminate the impact of halon on the environment (via ozone depletion) and develop a knockdown <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> system that can be employed in the design of new EU commercial aircraft e. g.

A variety of spray generation methods ranging from simple hose stream approaches to sophisticated water mist techniques have been developed and refined {{over the past century}} to address a diversity of fire protection challenges. Although the basic mechanisms for water based <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> are readily apparent, the underlying physics governing spray initiation (i. e. atomization) and the associated nozzle discharge characteristics are poorly understood. As a result, engineering analysis of these devices is riddled with empiricism from design conceptualization to performance evaluation.
