6000|$|I {{have just}} been talking to a girl with a shrill {{monotonous}} voice and an abrupt way of moving. She is fresh from school where they have taught her history and geography 'whereby a soul can be discerned,' {{but what is the}} value of an education, or even in the long run of a science, that does not begin with the personality, the habitual self, and illustrate all by that? Somebody should have taught her to speak for the most part on whatever note of her voice is most musical, and soften those harsh notes by speaking, not singing, to some stringed instrument, taking note after note and, as it were, caressing her words a little as if she loved the sound of them, and have taught her after this some beautiful <b>pantomimic</b> <b>dance,</b> till it had grown a habit to live for eye and ear. A wise theatre might make a training in strong and beautiful life the fashion, teaching before all else the heroic discipline of the looking-glass, for is not beauty, even as lasting love, {{one of the most difficult}} of the arts? ...|$|E
60|$|Again {{the combatants}} draw back and pause, and then {{forth from the}} ranks springs a chosen warrior, and hurls himself on an {{imaginary}} foe. He darts hither and thither with wild activity, he bounds five {{feet into the air}} like a panther, he twists through the grass like a snake, and, finally, making a tremendous effort, he seems to slay his airy opponent, and sinks exhausted to the ground. The onlookers mark their approval or disapproval of the dancer's feats by the rising and falling of the strange whistling noise which, without the slightest apparent movement of face or lip, issues from each mouth. Warrior after warrior comes forth in turn from the ranks and does battle with his invisible foe, and receives his meed of applause. The last warrior to spring forward with a wild yell is the future chief, Pagadi's son and successor, our friend of yesterday. He stands, with his shield in one hand and his lifted battle-axe--borne by him alone--in the other, looking proudly around, and rattling his lion-claw necklets, whilst from every side bursts forth a storm of sibillating applause, not from the soldiers only, but from the old men, women, and children. Through all his fierce <b>pantomimic</b> <b>dance</b> it continues, and when he has ended it redoubles, then dies away, but only to burst out again and again with unquenchable enthusiasm.|$|E
60|$|In {{the series}} of books I edit for my sister I confine myself to those that have I believe some special value to Ireland, now or in the future. I have asked Mr. Pound for these {{beautiful}} plays because I think they will help me to explain a certain possibility of the Irish dramatic movement. I am writing these words with my imagination stirred by {{a visit to the}} studio of Mr. Dulac, the distinguished illustrator of the Arabian Nights. I saw there the mask and head-dress to be worn in a play of mine by the player who will speak the part of Cuchulain, and who wearing this noble half-Greek half-Asiatic face will appear perhaps like an image seen in revery by some Orphic worshipper. I hope to have attained the distance from life which can make credible strange events, elaborate words. I have written a little play that can be played in a room for so little money that forty or fifty readers of poetry can pay the price. There will be no scenery, for three musicians, whose seeming sun-burned faces will I hope suggest that they have wandered from village to village in some country of our dreams, can describe place and weather, and at moments action, and accompany it all by drum and gong or flute and dulcimer. Instead of the players working themselves into a violence of passion indecorous in our sitting-room, the music, the beauty of form and voice all come to climax in <b>pantomimic</b> <b>dance.</b>|$|E
60|$|The girl {{lifted her}} eyes and gazed at Costello, and in her gaze was that trust of the humble in the proud, the gentle in the violent, {{which has been the}} tragedy of woman from the beginning. Costello led her among the dancers, and they were soon drawn into the rhythm of the Pavane, that stately dance which, with the Saraband, the Gallead, and the Morrice dances, had driven out, among all but the most Irish of the gentry, the quicker rhythms of the verse-interwoven, <b>pantomimic</b> <b>dances</b> of earlier days; and while they danced there came over them the unutterable melancholy, the weariness with the world, the poignant and bitter pity for one another, the vague anger against common hopes and fears, which is the exultation of love. And when a dance ended and the pipers laid down their pipes and lifted their horn noggins, they stood a little from the others waiting pensively and silently for the dance to begin again and the fire in their hearts to leap up and to wrap them anew; and so they danced and danced Pavane and Saraband and Gallead and Morrice through the night long, and many stood still to watch them, and the peasants came about the door and peered in, as though they {{understood}} that they would gather their children's children about them long hence, and tell how they had seen Costello dance with Dermott's daughter Oona, and become by the telling themselves a portion of ancient romance; but through all the dancing and piping Namara of the Lake went hither and thither talking loudly and making foolish jokes that all might seem well with him, and old Dermott of the Sheep grew redder and redder, and looked oftener and oftener at the doorway to see if the candles there grew yellow in the dawn.|$|R
40|$|John Weaver, an early-eighteenth century dancing master, {{sought to}} professionalize dance and raise its status by {{severing}} {{its dependence on}} words. He published scholarly texts on <b>pantomimic</b> <b>dance,</b> a style of dance with no spoken word, and worked to elevated dance to a respected art. Weaver's contributions to dance developed ballet into its own art form {{in the late eighteenth}} century in London. Dance was freed from dependence on spoken words, written text and theatrical effects. It became an independent, professional and respectable art form. The dancing master, position of a dancer and spectator was reshaped from a leisurely activity into a professionalized art. The dancing master acquired and applied a knowledge of the human body and its movements to educate his dancers. For the professional dancer, one received training and education from a reputable dancing master. Weaver's pantomimic choreography, alongside these treatises, distinguished the amateur, who performed in court dancing, from the professional dancer, one who was a paid member of a theater company. This separation gave the audience a new role as critics of the performance. In my thesis I use John Weaver's scholarly texts, An Essay Towards An History of Dancing, Anatomical and Mechanical Lectures and The Loves of Mars and Venus; A Dramatick entertainment of Dancing, Attempted in Imitation of the Pantomimes of the Ancient Greeks and Romans, to argue that Weaver sought to professionalize dance in the early eighteenth century in London...|$|E
