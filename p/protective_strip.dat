50|$|In February 1983 Alfa Romeo updated {{all of its}} sports cars; the Sprint {{received}} a major facelift. Thereafter the Alfasud prefix and Veloce suffix were abandoned, and the car was known as Alfa Romeo Sprint; this also {{in view of the}} release of the Alfa Romeo 33, which a few months later replaced the Alfasud family hatchback. The Sprint also {{received a}} platform upgrade, which was now {{the same as that of}} the Alfa Romeo 33; this entailed modified front suspension, brakes mounted in the wheels instead of inboard like on the Alfasud, and drum brakes at the rear end.Three models made up the Sprint range: 1.3 and 1.5, with engines and performance unchanged from the Alfasud Sprint Veloce, and the new 1.5 Quadrifoglio Verde—1.5 Cloverleaf in the UK.A multitude of changes were involved in the stylistic refresh; there were a new grille, headlamps, wing mirrors, window surrounds and C-pillar ornaments. Bumpers went from chrome to plastic, and large plastic <b>protective</b> <b>strips</b> were added to the body sides; both sported coloured piping, which was grey for 1.3 cars, red for the 1.5 and green for the 1.5 Quadrifoglio. At the rear new trapezoidal tail light assemblies were pieced together with the license plate holder by a black plastic fascia, topped by an Alfa Romeo badge—never present on the Alfasud Sprint. In the cabin there were new seats with cloth seating surfaces and Texalfa backs, a new steering wheel and changes to elements of the dashboard and door panels.

50|$|Thermal, {{chemical}} or mechanical stress can cause split ends. For example, {{the use of}} curling irons and other heat treatments may cause split ends.

500|$|To {{achieve a}} tone and quality {{that was true}} to the story as well as {{reflected}} {{the period in which}} it is set, Spielberg once again collaborated with cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, saying, [...] "Early on, we both knew that we did not want this to look like a Technicolor extravaganza about World War II, but more like color newsreel footage from the 1940s, which is very desaturated and low-tech." [...] Kamiński had the <b>protective</b> coating <b>stripped</b> from the camera lenses, making them closer to those used in the 1940s. He explains that [...] "without the protective coating, the light goes in and starts bouncing around, which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus." [...] The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through bleach bypass, a process that reduces brightness and color saturation. The shutter timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences, as opposed to the standard of 180-degree timing. Kamiński clarifies, [...] "In this way, we attained a certain staccato in the actors' movements and a certain crispness in the explosions, which makes them slightly more realistic." ...|$|R
50|$|This trend concentrating {{effort into}} bigger central located but larger {{enterprises}} {{turned into a}} trend spurred by Henry Cort's iron processing patent of 1784 leading in short order to foundries collocating near coal mines and accelerating the practice of supplanting the nations cottage industries. With that concentration of employees and separation from dwellings, horsedrawn trams became commonly available as a commuter resource for the daily commute to work. Mine railways were used from 1804 around Coalbrookdale in such industrial concentrations of mines and iron works, all demanding traction-drawing of bulky or heavy loads. These gave rise to extensive early wooden rail ways and initial animal powered trains of vehicles, then successively in just two decades <b>protective</b> iron <b>strips</b> nailed to protect the rails, steam drawn trains (1804) cast iron rails. Later, George Stephenson, inventor of the world-famous Rocket and {{a board member of}} a mine, convinced his board to use steam for traction. Next, he petitioned Parliament to license a public passenger railway, founding the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Soon after the intense public publicity, in part generated by the contest to find the best locomotive won by Stephenson's Rocket, railways underwent explosive growth worldwide, and the industrial revolution gradually went global.|$|R
40|$|Special Issue paper: The Use of Vegetation for Erosion Control and Environmental Protection. Metadata only record. Geotextiles {{constructed}} from Borassus aethiopum (black rhun palm) leaves {{are currently being}} investigated for their effectiveness in decreasing water erosion. The study aims to develop sustainable methods of soil conservation where the material meets selected criteria (readily available, simple and cost-effective to manufacture, provides immediate erosion control and possibly increases soil fertility and organic matter content). Grid mats were manufactured in a cottage workshop in The Gambia, West Africa. They are currently under investigation at the Hilton Experimental Site in Shropshire, UK. Eight runoff plots (10 × 1 m on a 15 ° slope) are being used, with duplicate treatments: (i) bare soil; (ii) grassed; (iii) bare soil with 1 m palm-mat buffer zones {{at the lower end}} of the plots; and (iv) completely covered with palm-mats. Results from one year of field study (2002 - 03) indicate sediment yield is 36 · 8 per cent from replicated covered plots and 35 · 9 per cent from the replicated buffer zone plots, compared to the control bare plots. Sediment yield equated to 0 · 45 t ha- 1 from bare soil, 0 · 09 t ha- 1 from grassed plots and 0 · 17 t ha- 1 from both the covered and buffer zone plots. The results suggest palm-mat application as <b>protective</b> buffer <b>strips</b> is highly effective in temperate climates.
