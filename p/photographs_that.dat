5|$|On 18 September, a {{preliminary}} enquiry {{in a district}} court was held {{to determine whether there}} was sufficient evidence for a trial to proceed. The magistrate overseeing the enquiry ordered Martin to stand trial for Gerard Lowe's murder on 2 October after hearing statements from 39 witnesses, and looking at more than 100 exhibits and 100 <b>photographs</b> <b>that</b> the prosecution had prepared as evidence.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1992, on {{the fiftieth}} {{anniversary of the}} conference, the site was finally opened as a Holocaust {{memorial}} and museum known as the Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz (House of the Wannsee Conference). The museum also hosts permanent exhibits of texts and <b>photographs</b> <b>that</b> document events of the Holocaust and its planning. The Joseph Wulf Bibliothek / Mediothek {{on the second floor}} houses a large collection of books on the Nazi era, plus other materials such as microfilms and original Nazi documents.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Grinsell became a Pilot Officer in the Air Photographic Branch of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1941. During he conflict, he was stationed in Egypt, where he spent time studying the archaeological remains of Ancient Egypt and visiting all of the pyramids near to Cairo. Based on these experiences, at his own expense he published Egyptian Pyramids in 1947. Designed as a guide to the sites, it was (as Grinsell acknowledged) heavily reliant on the earlier plans of Egyptologists but with additional aerial <b>photographs</b> <b>that</b> Grinsell had obtained through his involvement with the RAF. The book was largely ignored by Britain's Egyptological establishment.|$|E
5|$|An {{undertaking}} of {{the restoration}} team was {{that everything would}} be handled in a transparent fashion, that reporters, art historians and others with a bona fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, Nippon Television Network Corporation, had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of {{the restoration of the}} ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those <b>photographs</b> <b>that</b> they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.|$|E
5|$|Ava {{was also}} {{underneath}} the NOAA-2 and Nimbus 5 weather satellites. NOAA-2 provided <b>photographs</b> <b>that</b> {{were used to}} estimate Ava's maximum windspeeds. Satellite images were useful throughout the cyclone's existence, as did the wind reports of three ships when Ava was a young tropical storm. Nimbus 5 carried an Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer and Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer. Both were used to study Ava. The main data provided by the THIR was data indicating cloud temperatures. The ESMR's main data was on rainfall rates, densities, and distributions. The observations also provided confirmation that clouds that are not vertically developed very much can produce tropical rainfall.|$|E

5|$|Borobudur {{attracted}} {{attention in}} 1885, when Yzerman, the Chairman of the Archaeological Society in Yogyakarta, made a discovery about the hidden foot. <b>Photographs</b> <b>that</b> reveal reliefs on the hidden foot {{were made in}} 1890–1891. The discovery led the Dutch East Indies government {{to take steps to}} safeguard the monument. In 1900, the government set up a commission consisting of three officials to assess the monument: Brandes, an art historian, Theodoor van Erp, a Dutch army engineer officer, and Van de Kamer, a construction engineer from the Department of Public Works.|$|E
5|$|During {{his final}} years, Narayan, ever fond of conversation, would spend almost every evening with N. Ram, the {{publisher}} of The Hindu, drinking coffee and talking about various topics until well past midnight. Despite his fondness of meeting and talking to people, he stopped giving interviews. The apathy towards interviews {{was the result of}} an interview with Time, after which Narayan had to spend a few days in the hospital, as he was dragged around the city to take <b>photographs</b> <b>that</b> were never used in the article.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{was also}} {{influenced}} by {{a special edition of}} radical anticonformist magazine Le Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell) that was published in October 1930. Devoted to the United States, it contained a variety of <b>photographs</b> <b>that</b> influenced his depiction of the country. Hergé used its images of skyscrapers as a basis for his depiction of Chicago and adopted its account of Native Americans being evicted from their land when oil was discovered there. He was particularly interested in the articles in the magazine written by reporter Claude Blanchard, who had recently travelled the U.S. He reported on the situation in Chicago and New York City and met with Native Americans in New Mexico. Blanchard's article discussed the gangster George Moran, whom literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès believed provided the basis for the character Bobby Smiles.|$|E

5|$|Kirkland cites his {{assistant}} director Matthew Nastuk {{as a big}} influence on the episode. He became heavily involved with the animation because {{he had grown up}} in New Jersey, where the Thomas Edison National Historical Park that Homer and Bart visit is located. To help make the museum look as authentic as possible, Kirkland and Nastuk visited it and took a large number of <b>photographs</b> <b>that</b> they brought back to the animation studio. At one point in the episode, Homer writes complex math formulas on a chalkboard. The producers wanted them to be actual formulas, so writer David X. Cohen got in contact with a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who were able to provide them.|$|E
5|$|After Parry-Jones's death Scott lived {{quietly for}} a while in the West Country. In January 1974 he met Tim Keigwin, Thorpe's Conservative {{opponent}} in North Devon, and gave his version of his relationship with Thorpe. Keigwin was advised by the Conservative leadership that the material should not be used. Scott also confided in his doctor, Ronald Gleadle, who was treating him for depression. He had shown Gleadle his dossier of documents; the doctor, without Scott's knowledge or consent, sold the papers to Holmes, who had assumed the role of Thorpe's protector after Bessell settled permanently in California in January 1974. Holmes paid £2,500 for the documents, which were promptly burned in the home of Thorpe's solicitor. A further cache of papers was discovered in November 1974, by builders renovating a London office formerly used by Bessell. They found a briefcase containing letters and <b>photographs</b> <b>that</b> apparently compromised Thorpe, among them Scott's 1965 letter to Ursula Thorpe. Undecided what to do with their find, they took it to the Sunday Mirror newspaper. Sidney Jacobson, the paper's deputy chairman, decided not to publish the material and passed the briefcase and its content to Thorpe. Copies of the documents were, however, kept in the newspaper's files.|$|E
5|$|Crawford enjoyed foreign travel. In 1928 the OS {{sent him}} to the Middle East to collect aerial <b>photographs</b> <b>that</b> had been {{produced}} during the First World War and which were stored at Baghdad, Amman, and Heliopolis. In mid-1931 he visited Germany and Austria, furthering his interest in photography through the purchase of a Voigtländer. He later visited Italy with the intent of examining the possibility of producing OS maps pinpointing the country's archaeological sites; in November 1932 he met with the Italian leader Benito Mussolini, who was interested in Crawford's ideas about creating an OS map of archaeological sites in Rome. This was part of a wider project to produce a series of maps covering the entirety of the Roman Empire, for which Crawford visited various parts of Europe during the late 1920s and 1930s. Holiday destinations included Germany, Austria, Romania, Corsica, Malta, Algeria, and Tunisia, and in 1936 he purchased a plot of land in Cyprus on which he had a house built. During these vacations, he visited archaeological sites and met with local archaeologists, encouraging them to contribute articles to Antiquity.|$|E

5|$|The 160 hidden panels do {{not form}} a {{continuous}} story, but each panel provides one complete illustration {{of cause and}} effect. There are depictions of blameworthy activities, from gossip to murder, with their corresponding punishments. There are also praiseworthy activities, that include charity and pilgrimage to sanctuaries, and their subsequent rewards. The pains of hell and the pleasure of heaven are also illustrated. There are scenes of daily life, complete with the full panorama of samsara (the endless cycle of birth and death). The encasement base of the Borobudur temple was dissembled to reveal the hidden foot, and the reliefs were photographed by Casijan Chepas in 1890. It is these <b>photographs</b> <b>that</b> are displayed in Borobudur Museum (Karmawibhangga Museum), located just several hundred meters north of the temple. During the restoration, the foot encasement was reinstalled, covering the Karmawibhangga reliefs. Today, only {{the southeast corner of}} the hidden foot is revealed and visible for visitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{first five}} seasons {{of the series}} were mainly filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia; {{production}} of the show's sixth season, however, was based in Los Angeles, California. Several of the scenes were filmed on the sets from NYPD Blue, whose sets were located just across from The X-Files studios. All of Fellig's cameras were borrowed from the University of California's Museum of Photography. Many of the photographs were used courtesy of Corbis. The production staff of The X-Files were tasked with not only creating the <b>photographs</b> <b>that</b> Fellig {{was supposed to have}} taken, but also with crafting each so that they would appear {{as if they had been}} taken from different times. Tom Day, the episodes property master, had to research popular government typefaces and printing technologies to make the pictures appear as historically accurate as possible. Geoffrey Lewis, who portrayed Fellig, was photographed several times and each photo was edited to give the photographs the appearance of coming from different eras.|$|E
