5000|$|This {{attention}} {{is due in}} part to its magnificent, remote mountain setting. Its location within a protected area in a national <b>park</b> <b>prohibits</b> motorized ground access, and the risk of flooding in its entrance has limited most explorations to mid or late winter, so cavers must access it via a 20 km ski with towed sleds, or by helicopter. This feeling of remoteness is compounded by the cave's linear layout and its single entrance. The classic trip, from the entrance to the Ice Plug by the shortest route, traverses 9 km of cave passage. Cavers often are underground for four or five days, staying at two underground camps.|$|R

50|$|In Sweden, {{alternate}} side parking (datumparkering) {{is applied}} in zones covering an entire city, with signs indicating {{this at the}} city perimeter. Inside such date zones (datumzon), <b>parking</b> is <b>prohibited</b> {{on the morning of}} odd dates {{on the side of the}} street where houses have odd numbers. The drivers must think of what date it is the next morning if they leave the car in the evening. Inspired by Stockholm, more and more Swedish cities are abandoning such confusing zones and instead provide permanent parking on one or both sides of the street, with the exception for one day per week during December through May, when snowplowing and sweeping of sand can be required. The day when <b>parking</b> is <b>prohibited</b> is posted on a sign for each street.|$|R

50|$|More {{recent studies}} on Celaque’s Conservation efforts have shown less {{positive}} results. The {{change in the}} park’s environment had slowed down after 1995. Though the <b>park</b> <b>prohibits</b> outside logging and agriculture, it does on restrict the communities that live inside the boundaries. The patchwork {{on the edges of}} the park had grown dramatically due to increase in community agriculture. Deeper inside the park more agriculture land is being used and much of that land is using unsustainable fertilizers. Inhabitants have also grown intensely. 8 communities in Celaque’s upper third create a patchwork of villages. However, only 6% of the land is dedicated to small-scale farming and most of the damage is still being done through illegal logging and commercial agriculture. Due to the recent high demand of coffee beans, the slopes contain more coffee plantations than ever.|$|R
