Stone initially denied the report. On the Good Morning America program he said: [...] "An exhaustive investigation now indicates that a domestic employee who I discharged for substance abuse on the second time that we learned that he had a drug problem is the perpetrator who had access to my home, access to my computer, access to my <b>password,</b> <b>access</b> to my postage meter, access to my post-office box key".

5000|$|The player must {{attempt to}} hack into the Magma Ltd. {{computer}} {{system at the}} beginning of the game by guessing the logon <b>password.</b> <b>Access</b> can be gained if the player knows the password, which really only ever becomes apparent to the player after gaining access, through another means of entry, to the later stage of the game. Typing help or h in the command line would give a clue as to what the valid password is. Since initial attempts at entry would consist of guessing (and likely failing), access would eventually be granted to the player due to a malfunction in the security system. Once admittance has been made, the player is then asked to identify various parts of a robot unit, by pointing the cursor at the relevant parts and pressing the fire button. Most parts of the unit have exotic and technical names, such as [...] "asynchronous data compactor" [...] or [...] "phlamson joint"—this again allows more room for error by initially trying to guess which part each name belongs to. Failure to identify each part correctly forces the player to take a retest until a 100 percent identification is made, at which point the player is then allowed to continue.|$|E

40|$|The {{microcontroller}} and {{the coding}} {{is the heart}} of making a timer. The strategic release planning is gotten from the concept of how a door machine with <b>password</b> <b>access</b> functions. In this thesis project, all that has been studied in school such as circuit theory, electronics, digital design and microprocessors basic and programming course are combined to the success of this project. Therefore the objective is producing a practical knowledge of what has been studied which is the timer with <b>password</b> <b>access.</b> The method used was an inspiration gotten after reviewing many materials in some respective topic related to designing a timer. The particular method comes from creating an SPI Interface from the Programmer to the Microcontroller to Make Transferring More Convenient. The performance of the MCU, LCD and keypad was just as was expected in the software code and hardware also. The password is inputted, timer is set appropriately and timer runs till port is opened. To conclude, the result can be achieved in different method but this method was for an easy method for beginners. 076435355...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis Thesis reviews the increasing need for security {{in a personal}} computer (PC) environment and proposes a new approach for securing PC applications at the application layer. The Relay Race Approach extends two standard approaches : data encryption and <b>password</b> <b>access</b> control at the main program level, to the subprogram level {{by the use of}} a special parameter, the "Baton". The applicability of this approach is demonstrated in an original Basic application and an existing Dbase IV application, representing both third generation language (3 GL) and fourth generation language (4 GL) environments. The Approach can add to overall network security in the PC LAN environment as well. The Approach is successful and proposed enhancements can strengthen the Approach. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Authentication is as {{fundamentally}} {{a part of}} {{our lives}} as privacy. We use authentication throughout our everyday lives, especially on the Internet, you might have found one user having more and more usernames or IDs and passwords, which contains users private information. It is very difficult to remember all usernames and passwords and it is unsafe to write them down on notebooks. To solve this problem, this paper explained a design and implementation of Passwords Management System (PMS), by which you can manage your usernames and passwords efficiently. It was made based on Blowfish Algorithm, which is a symmetric block cipher provides high security and designed by Bruce Schneier. Because of the difficulties associated with remembering passwords, a group of software applications, password managers has emerged. These applications deal with everything from the simple storage of user IDs and passwords to the management of <b>password</b> <b>access</b> across many users...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the creation of}} Central Pipeline at Central Connecticut State University. The previous campus system forces users to possess multiple usernames/passwords to access system resources. Using the Campus Pipeline Web Platform, the Information Technology Department at Central was able to integrate all of the disparate systems (administrative databases, student/faculty information systems, and WebCT for online learning), and offer faculty, students, and staff single username and <b>password</b> <b>access</b> to email, personal information, and course information (if applicable). This paper {{discusses the}} current system architecture {{in terms of the}} kinds of data accessed through the system, including access of the system itself.

Computer systems with AIMAS prototypes have been installed at Kiev Institute of Nuclear Research (KINR), Sevastopol Institute of Nuclear Energy & Industry (SINEI) and the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Nuclear Safety database management system (RDBMS) and application development environment. It has been designed to be highly flexible and configurable, and to support a wide range of computing infrastructure needs and facility requirements. AIMAS functions include basic physical inventory tracking, transaction histories, reporting, and system administration functions (system configuration and security). Security measures include multilevel <b>password</b> <b>access</b> controls, all transactions logged with the user ID, and system administration controls. Interfaces to external modules are being designed to provide nuclear fuel burn-up adjustment and barcode scanning capabilities for physical inventory taking. 1 ref...|$|E
