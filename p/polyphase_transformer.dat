50|$|For {{polyphase}} systems, multiple single-phase transformers can be used, or {{all phases}} can {{be connected to}} a single <b>polyphase</b> <b>transformer.</b> For a three phase transformer, the three primary windings are connected together and the three secondary windings are connected together. Examples of connections are wye-delta, delta-wye, delta-delta and wye-wye. A vector group indicates {{the configuration of the}} windings and the phase angle difference between them. If a winding is connected to earth (grounded), the earth connection point is usually the center point of a wye winding. If the secondary is a delta winding, the ground may be connected to a center tap on one winding (high leg delta) or one phase may be grounded (corner grounded delta). A special purpose <b>polyphase</b> <b>transformer</b> is the zigzag transformer. There are many possible configurations that may involve more or fewer than six windings and various tap connections.|$|E
50|$|The phase {{windings}} of a <b>polyphase</b> <b>transformer</b> can {{be connected}} internally in different configurations, {{depending on what}} characteristics are needed from the transformer. In a three-phase power system, {{it may be necessary}} to connect a three-wire system to a four-wire system, or vice versa. Because of this, transformers are manufactured with a variety of winding configurations to meet these requirements.|$|E

5000|$|Neutral wires {{are usually}} {{connected}} at a neutral bus within panelboards or switchboards, and are [...] "bonded" [...] to earth ground at either the electrical service entrance, or at transformers within the system. For electrical installations with split-phase (three-wire single-phase service), the neutral {{point of the}} system is at the center-tap on the secondary side of the service transformer. For larger electrical installations, such as those with polyphase service, the neutral point is usually at the common connection on the secondary side of delta/wye connected transformers. Other arrangements of <b>polyphase</b> <b>transformers</b> may result in no neutral point, and no neutral conductors.|$|R
40|$|A {{high power}} {{three-phase}} rectifier {{that does not}} require a passive phase shifter (e. g. <b>polyphase</b> multi-winding <b>transformer)</b> was studied analytically and by simulation. The proposed rectifier includes 6 uni-directional switches and 24 diodes that are used to realize two three-phase bridges. The outputs of the bridges are connected in parallel via two blocking reactors. One of the bridges is operating with a positive phase delay of 15 o while the other is operated with a negative delay of 15 o. Analytical derivations, confirmed by simulation, predict that THD of the proposed rectifier's line current will be about 17 % {{in a wide range of}} load currents. It is suggested that the proposed rectifier is advantageous in high power application. 1...|$|R
50|$|All the {{exhibits}} were from commercial enterprises. Participants included General Electric, Brush, Western Electric, and Westinghouse. The Westinghouse Company displayed several polyphase systems. The exhibits included a switchboard, <b>polyphase</b> generators, step-up <b>transformers,</b> transmission line, step-down transformers, commercial size induction motors and synchronous motors, and rotary direct current converters (including an operational railway motor). The working scaled system allowed the public {{a view of}} a system of polyphase power which could be transmitted over long distances, and be utilized, including the supply of direct current. Meters and other auxiliary devices were also present.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} electrical {{design and}} operational {{characteristics of a}} zero-voltage-switching 20 kHz polyphase bridge, boost converter/modulator for klystron pulse application. The DC-DC converter derives the buss voltages from a standard 13. 8 kV to 2300 Y substation cast-core transformer. Energy storage and filtering is provided by self-clearing metallized hazy polypropylene traction capacitors. Three "H-Bridge" IGBT switching networks are used to generate the <b>polyphase</b> 20 kHz <b>transformers</b> primary drive waveforms. The 20 kHz drive waveforms are chirped the appropriate duration to generate the desired klystron pulse width. PWM (pulse width modulation) of the individual 20 kHz pulses is utilized to provide regulated output waveforms with adaptive feedforward and feedback techniques. The boost transformer design utilizes amorphous nanocrystalline material that provides the required low core loss at design flux levels and switching frequencies. Resonant shunt peaking is used on the transformer secondary to boost output voltage and resonate transformer leakage inductance. With the appropriate transformer leakage inductance and peaking capacitance, zero-voltage-switching of the IGBT's is attained, minimizing switching losses. A review of these design parameters and a comparison of computer calculations, scale model, and first article results will be performed. Comment: THE 1...|$|R
40|$|The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) {{is a new}} 1. 4 MW {{average power}} beam, 1 GeV {{accelerator}} being built at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The accelerator requires 15 converter-modulator stations each providing between 9 and 11 MW pulses with up to a 1. I MW average power. The converter-modulator {{can be described as}} a resonant 20 kHz polyphase boost inverter. Each converter modulator derives its buss voltage from a standard substation cast-core transformer. Each substation is followed by an SCR pre-regulator to accommodate voltage changes from no load to full load, in addition to providing a soft-start function. Energy storage is provided by self-clearing metallized hazy polypropylene traction capacitors. These capacitors do not fail short, but clear any internal anomaly. Three 'H-Bridge' IGBT transistor networks are used to generate the <b>polyphase</b> 20 kHz <b>transformer</b> primary drive waveforms. The 20 kHz drive waveforms are time-gated to generate the desired klystron pulse width. Pulse width modulation of the individual 20 lcHz pulses is utilized to provide regulated output waveforms with DSP based adaptive feedforward and feedback techniques. The boost transformer design utilizes nanocrystalline alloy that provides low core loss at design flux levels and switching frequencies. Capacitors are used on the transformer secondary networks to resonate the leakage inductance. The transformers are wound for a specific leakage inductance, not turns ratio. This design technique generates multiple secondary volts per turn as compared to the primary. With the appropriate tuning conditions, switching losses are minimized. The resonant topology has the added benefit of being deQed in a klystron fault condition, with little energy deposited in the arc. This obviates the need of crowbars or other related networks. A review of these design parameters, operational performance, production status, and OWL installation and performance to date will be presented...|$|R
