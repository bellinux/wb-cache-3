40|$|This paper {{sets out}} an {{overarching}} theoretical framework for explaining and exploring {{the processes of}} social exclusion, incorporating themes from the literature. It proposes that inclusion hinges on participation in social relationships enacted through ¿transactional processes¿, where currencies are assessed and goods distributed or withheld accordingly. ¿Currencies¿ are not just financial, but also human ¿ evidence of human or social capital ¿ what people have, do or are. The currencies required depend on {{the objective of the}} transaction. However, even where people have currency, transaction may be prevented by inaccessible infrastructure (buildings, transport, communications, etc), or through failure to recognize currency. Both poverty (lack of capital or currencies) and discrimination (failure to enable, recognize, or act consistently upon, the <b>presentation</b> of <b>currencies)</b> need to be tackled. The components that make up social context are explored: the norms and socio-cultural objectives (economic, social, political, etc) and the transactions, currencies and goods which are consequently prioritized. Terms of inclusion may accommodate more, or less, objectives, currencies and goods, notwithstanding that some objectives will be mutually incompatible and that production of certain goods (e. g. land) cannot be increased. Objectives and norms impact on how identity is construed, or misconstrued. A typology of discrimination is described, along with its potential exclusory outcomes. Yet, changes in attitudes and priorities might reveal scope for redrafting the terms of inclusion to promote and preserve greater diversity within the mainstream...|$|R

40|$|In the WWW, {{people are}} {{engaging}} in interaction with more, and more diverse information than ever before, so there is an increasing need for information “filtering. ” But because {{of the diversity of}} information resources, and the lack of traditional quality control on the WWW, the criteria of authority and quality of information that people have used for this purpose in past contexts may no longer be relevant. This paper reports on a study of people’s decision making with respect to quality and authority in the WWW. Seven facets of judgment of information quality were identified: source, content, format, <b>presentation,</b> <b>currency,</b> accuracy, and speed of loading. People mentioned source credibility with two levels: institutional level and individual level. Authority was identified as a underlying theme in source credibility. Institutional authority involved: institutional domain identified by URL; institution type; and institution reputation recognized by names. Individual authority involved: identification of creator/author; creator/author affiliation; and creator/author’s name. People were more or less concerned with evaluating information quality depending upon: the consequence of use of information; act or commitment based on information; and the focus of inquiry. It was also found that people believed that the web, as an institution, was less authoritative and less credible than other types of information systems...|$|E
