40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{conventional}} settings that were employed by painters of conversation piece portraits in eighteenth-century England. The focus is upon the placement of groups “in conversation” around the hearth, in front of a chimney piece. My argument is that this situation was commonly used because it was understood that the hearth was a desirable place at which to greet one’s guests. I suggest that one of the main functions of the hearth conversation piece was to replicate the experience of meeting hosts who had placed themselves in a highly appropriate location. The main argument here is that this type of portrait generally replicated the experience of a private greeting. I suggest that this type of picture points to the strong connection between conversation piece portraits and rituals of hospitality. Hearth conversations were, it is argued here, not likely to be acts of conspicuous consumption. Similarly, it is unlikely that they functioned to <b>project</b> <b>codes</b> of politeness, as sometimes argued. These pictures undoubtedly reflect notions of good or polite behaviour, particularly as regarded the meeting and greeting of guests.

40|$|The Los Alamos Crestone Project {{is part of}} the Department of Energy's (DOE) Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative, or ASCI Program. The {{main goal}} of this {{software}} development project is to investigate the use of continuous adaptive mesh refinement (CAMR) techniques for application to problems of interest to the Laboratory. There are many code development efforts in the Crestone Project, both unclassified and classified codes. In this overview I will discuss the unclassified SAGE and the RAGE codes. The SAGE (SAIC adaptive grid Eulerian) code is a one-, two-, and three-dimensional multimaterial Eulerian massively parallel hydrodynamics code for use in solving a variety of high-deformation flow problems. The RAGE CAMR code is built from the SAGE code by adding various radiation packages, improved setup utilities and graphics packages and is used for problems in which radiation transport of energy is important. The goal of these massively-parallel versions of the codes is to run extremely large problems in a reasonable amount of calendar time. Our target is scalable performance to {approx} 10, 000 processors on a 1 billion CAMR computational cell problem that requires hundreds of variables per cell, multiple physics packages (e. g. radiation and hydrodynamics), and implicit matrix solves for each cycle. A general description of the RAGE code has been published in [l],[2], [3] and [4]. Currently, the largest simulations we do are three-dimensional, using around 500 million computation cells and running for literally months of calendar time using {approx} 2000 processors. Current ASCI platforms range from several 3 -teraOPS supercomputers to one 12 -teraOPS machine at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the White machine, and one 20 -teraOPS machine installed at Los Alamos, the Q machine. Each machine is a system comprised of many component parts that must perform in unity for the successful run of these simulations. Key features of any massively parallel system include the processors, the disks, the interconnection between processors, the operating system, libraries for message passing and parallel 1 / 0 and other fundamental units of the system. We will give an overview of the current status of the Crestone <b>Project</b> <b>codes</b> SAGE and RAGE. These codes are intended for general applications without tuning of algorithms or parameters. We have run a wide variety of physical applications from millimeter-scale laboratory laser experiments to the multikilometer-scale asteroid impacts into the Pacific Ocean to parsec-scale galaxy formation. Examples of these simulations will be shown. The goal of our effort is to avoid ad hoc models and attempt to rely on first-principles physics. In addition to the large effort on developing parallel code physics packages, a substantial effort in the project is devoted to improving the computer science and software quality engineering (SQE) of the <b>Project</b> <b>codes</b> as well as a sizable effort on the verification and validation (V&V) of the resulting codes. Examples of these efforts for our project will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the diet composition, feeding preferences, and mouth morphology of the silver therapon (Leiopotherapon plumbeus, Kner 1864) larvae under captive conditions. Larvae were reared in outdoor tanks (4 m 3) with natural food grown 2 weeks prior to start of larval rearing. Food preference {{was measured by the}} Chesson's electivity index (Î± i). Gut content analysis of larvae sampled between 5 and 25 days after hatching (DAH) showed the dominance in the diet by zooplankton, mainly copepod nauplii, cladocerans and insect larvae. Small fish larvae (5 â€“ 9 DAH; 3. 32 â€“ 6. 29 mm standard length) preferred cladocerans, ciliates and copepod nauplii; whereas older larvae (12 â€“ 25 DAH; 5. 45 â€“ 19. 26 mm standard length) preferred insect larvae over cladocerans and adult insects. The mouth gape size at 5 DAH was 359 Î¼m and increased to 3. 75 mm at 40 DAH when body size grew at an average rate of 0. 59 mm d âˆ’ 1. The standard length (SL) of L. plumbeus larvae was strongly associated with mouth size (r 2 = 0. 98, P < 0. 05), indicating a progressive increase of ingested prey size of the fish larvae. These results clarified the early life feeding ecology of this species, which is essential in developing effective hatchery techniques.

40|$|Life-history {{parameters}} and the fitness of tephritid flies are {{closely linked to}} diet. Studies of locomotor behaviour can provide insights to these links, although {{little is known about}} how locomotor behaviour is influenced by diet. In the present study, video recordings of Queensland fruit flies Bactrocera tryoni Froggatt (Diptera: Tephritidae) (‘Q-flies’) that are maintained individually in cages are used to determine how diet affects the activity patterns (flight, walking, grooming, inactivity) of males and females at ages ranging from 4 to 30 days. The frequency and total duration of activities over 10 -min trials are affected by diet, age and sex. Supplementation of diet with hydrolysed yeast results in a higher frequency and duration of flight in flies of all ages and both sexes. The effect of diet on other activities varies with age. Q-flies fed sugar only increase walking frequency steadily from 4 to 30 days posteclosion, whereas flies fed sugar+yeast have higher walking frequencies at 4 and 10 days than flies fed sugar only, although they then exhibit a sharp decline at 30 days post-eclosion. The frequency and duration of inactivity remain consistent in flies fed sugar+yeast, whereas flies fed sugar only exhibit a marked increase in inactivity from 4 to 30 days post-eclosion. Compared with older flies, 4 day-old Q-flies fed sugar only spend considerably more time grooming. The potential of activity monitoring as a quality control test for flies that are mass-reared for use in sterile insect technique programmes is discussed.

The sample is a plastic tube with {{a diameter of}} 25 mm, filled with uniform Soda-Lime Glass (SiO 2 -Na 2 O) beads of diameters 2. 5 mm (with standard deviation 0. 1 mm). The sample has been scanned in the same conditions for each dataset, where the number of projections is halved after each batch scan (starting from 2048, down to 64 projections). This allows us to understand the effects of fewer projections, and develop algorithms that deliver quality results when the information content is low (i. e. faster scans or lower dose). These dataset are also suitable for developing and/or testing 	segmentation methods, 	image or data correction techniques (e. g. centre of rotation), 	forward and back project implementations, and 	benchmarking user’s own code/method.

Egg size, larval size at hatching, yolk resorption rate, onset of feeding and development of some morphological characters were examined. Fertilized eggs (430 â€“ 610 Âµm in diameter) were spherical, yellowish, demersal and slightly adhesive. First cleavage occurred 6 min post-fertilization and embryos hatched 21 â€“ 24 h post-fertilization under ambient temperature of 27. 5 Â± 0. 1 Â°C. Newly hatched larvae [1. 79 Â± 0. 04 mm in total length (TL) ] with yolk volume of 0. 579 Â± 0. 126 mm 3 had no functional or pigmented eyes, mouth or digestive tract. The eyes became fully pigmented and mouth opened [31 and 36. 5 hours post-hatching (hph) ] shortly before yolk resorption at 39 hph and when larvae had grown to 2. 65 Â± 0. 14 mm in TL. Some morphological characters such as total length, pre-anal length and eye diameter decreased following yolk resorption, which also coincided {{with the development of}} foraging capacities shortly before exogenous feeding was initiated. L. plumbeus larvae initiated exogenous feeding at 54 hph, indicating a short (15 h after yolk resorption) transitional feeding period. Larval growth at the early stages of development (54 â€“ 72 hph) was rapid and steadily increased from 288 to 720 hph, when larvae, 12. 05 Â± 4. 02 mm in TL, closely resembled the external characteristics of their adult conspecifics.

40|$|This {{examination}} {{has been}} made in cooperation with Jernhusen which is an estate company owned by the government, with estates along the railways in Sweden. This assignment is to help Jernhusens business area Projektfastigheter with their experience feedback, which is to-day almost absent. Business area Projektfastigheter has the task of supporting Jernhusens three other business areas with skills and resources for the estate projects that Jernhusen runs. Jernhusen must become stronger with the collecting of experiences and as a business because of the liberalization of the railways, which leads to a more competitive market. A tool for this is successful experience feedback. The concept of experience feedback is to gain experience across a variety of cases, where individuals and/or groups can chose situations with relevant similarities and differences with current case. Systematically work with experience feedback in the construction business is neglected, and the companies that have successful experience feedback have been working with the collection of experiences since the company was founded. The employees sees the experience feedback as something obvious in their daily work, and agrees that the collecting of experience gains time, produces less errors, gives better quality and a better product. The reference companies have clearly shown that emotional rewards, such as appreciation or con-sideration, gives better results than economic rewards. There are procedures and templates for the exchange of experience feedback on Jernhusen, however, there are not known in the company. Another problem is that Jernhusens employees do not have time to work with experience feedback, due to lack of time, and that the manage-ment is not asking for this, which leads to that the subject is not a priority. This causes unne-cessary repeat of Jernhusens errors. To hear about co-workers experiences, however, is seen as something appreciated and fun, but above all very useful in their own work. Jernhusens first common basic project management is Jernboken. Jernboken includes a first version of templates, checklists, job classification, job tracking, <b>project</b> <b>codes</b> and internal time system. Jernboken describes the different phases of the project and the decisions to be taken in each phase. Jernboken is perceived as something positive by the people at Jernhusen, therefore Jernhusen should exploit Jernboken for creating a successful experience feedback by adding templates and procedures to it. The recommendations to Jernhusen, is therefore that it is important they get the templates for the experience feedback in to Jernboken, to capture a so-called fire soul and assign a specific person to be responsible for the experience feedback-system. Management must show clearly that experience feedback is something that is considered of the utmost importance and make sure that the employees sees the benefits of successful experience feedback. Experience feed-back should also be included in Jernhusens job descriptions, as a point on the minutes of meetings, as well as a requirement for project to be completed. Because of the employees pos-itive attitude to experience feedback is the assessment that they can become successful...|$|E
