5|$|Inferences about {{behavior}} {{can also be}} drawn from examination of the inner ear. The semicircular canals within the inner ear aid in balance, and the lateral semicircular canal is usually <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> when the animal holds its head in an alert posture. When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal is <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This contrasts with many other theropods, where the head was more strongly downturned when in the alert position. The lateral canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to side-to-side motions of the head.|$|E

It was found that these low contact area specimens exhibited both concave and convex behavior. This behavior was attributed to discontinuity closure and yielding of the intact material, respectively. The overall trend in behavior was found to be a function of the contact area at the discontinuity boundary, the initial discontinuity aperture, and the yield stress. © 2007 ASCE...|$|R

5000|$|A section plane across any {{elongated}} form {{in principle}} is {{held to be}} transverse if it is orthogonal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> axis (e.g., a transverse section of a finger; {{if there is no}} length axis, {{there is no way to}} define such sections, or there are infinite possibilities). Therefore, transverse body sections in vertebrates are <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ribs, which are orthogonal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vertebral column, that represents the body axis both in animals and man. The brain also has an intrinsic longitudinal axis - that of the primordial elongated neural tube - which becomes largely vertical with the erect posture of Man, similarly as the body axis, except at its rostral end, as commented above. This explains that transverse spinal cord sections are roughly <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> our ribs, or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> However, this is only true for the spinal cord and the brainstem, since the forebrain end of the neural axis bends crook-like during early morphogenesis into the hypothalamus, where it ends; the orientation of true transverse sections accordingly changes, and is no longer <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ribs and <b>ground,</b> but perpendicular to them; lack of awareness of this morphologic brain peculiarity (present in all vertebrate brains without exceptions) has caused and still causes erroneous thinking on forebrain brain parts. Acknowledging the singularity of rostral transverse sections, tradition has introduced a different descriptor for them, namely coronal sections. Coronal sections divide the forebrain from rostral (front) to caudal (back), forming a series orthogonal (transverse) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local bent axis.

Roof polygons are generated using airborne laser scanning of 1 x 1 meter grid and ground plans (footprints) extracted from technical feature maps. An effective algorithm is used for fixing the mutual displacement of these datasets. The well known Hough Transform is extended to 3 D for extracting planes from the point cloud. Generally speaking, planes are rejected if the clusters of points on these planes, do not span a considerable area. Furthermore, it is assumed that valid planes are close <b>to</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> plan lines. Points corresponding to each valid plane are subtracted from the original point cloud, and the Hough Transform is performed on the remainder. By this approach, the disturbing influence of already evaluated points, is avoided. Small variations of the roof surface might lead to multiple slightly differing planes. Such planes are detected and merged. Intersecting planes are identified, and a polygon mesh of the roof is constructed. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> low precision of the laser scanning, a rule-based postprocessing of the roof is applied before adding the walls. * Corresponding author. 1...|$|R
