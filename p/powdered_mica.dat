The {{status and}} {{progress}} of high pressure resistant insulation material {{at home and}} abroad were reviewed from aspects like high thermal conductivity, high temperature resistance, environ-mental protection and modification of nano-particles. High thermal conductivity insulation materials can improve the efficiency of cooling system and decrease the energy loss of electric machines. Some famous foreign companies keep ahead in this field. Current domestic high temperature resistant solvent less insulating varnish can only be used in small and medium sized generators instead of high voltage generators.

40|$|Seventy-five {{synthetic}} <b>powder</b> trioctahedral <b>mica</b> samples (between Mg, Co, Ni, and Fe end members, {{with different}} degrees of oxidation, vacancy and Al/Si contents, and including an OH/F substitution series) were studied by room-temperature powder X-ray diffraction. The iron-bearing samples were studied by 57 Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy. Subsets of the samples were also characterized by scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy, optical microscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, and gas chromatography. Lattice parameters (refined under the 1 M stacking polytype, space group C 2 /m) were determined for all powder samples and iron site populations ([4]Fe 3 +, [6]Fe 2 +, and [6]Fe 2 +) were obtained from Mossbauer spectroscopy. The relation (c/a) cosbeta* = 113 was found to hold exactly (within experimental error) for all synthetic powders whereas it does not hold in general for synthetic and natural 1 M single-crystals. The above relation is predicted to hold for geometric home-octahedral sheets (having equal M 1 and M 2 site bond lengths) and not to hold for geometric meso-octahedral sheets (having unequal M 1 and M 2 site bond lengths). The counter-rotation of the M 2 site of 1 M single-crystals exactly (within experimental error) follows the geometric meso-octahedral sheet model, which, assuming a uniform octahedral sheet height and site-specific M 1 and M 2 bond lengths, predicts site-specific flattening angles and a counter-rotation angle for the M 2 site which is uniquely determined by the bond length difference between the M 1 and M 2 sites. A geometric meso-octahedral 2 : 1 layer silicate was shown to require corrugated tetrahedral sheets composed of bond-distorted tetrahedra. Key geometric meso-octahedral distortions in 1 M single-crystals were identified and elucidated: (i) intra-layer top-bottom displacements within a TOT layer; and (ii) a tetrahedral bending angle between the apical bond and the pyramidal base formed by the three basal bonds. Plots of lattice parameter b versus average-octahedral-bond-length allowed the following distinction to be made: Unoxidized divalent synthetic solid solution series tend to evolve along constant flattening-angle lines whereas trivalent octahedral cation and vacancy bearing natural single-crystals and synthetic powders follow trends with varying flattening angles. We found that the bond length of a given interlayer cationic species monotonously increases as the tetrahedral rotation angle alpha decreases in trioctahedral- 1 M single-crystals. An upper limit of tetrahedral rotation of alpha = 9. 5 ° was demonstrated to occur in trioctahedral- 1 M K-rich micas having an sheet, for both synthetic powders and natural single-crystals. Other attempts at applying geometric crystal chemical models and at identifying structure-chemical relationships from structural refinement data {{will benefit from the}} perspective of our more complete and systematic approach based on pursuing simple geometrical models using 'regular' coordination polyhedrons and characteristic cation-specific bond lengths up to the limit beyond which such models are shown to necessarily breakdown because of unavoidable 'non-regular' polyhedral distortions.

40|$|The {{need for}} optimal {{recovery}} {{of crude oil}} from sandstone and carbonate reservoirs around the world has never been greater for the petroleum industry. Water-flooding {{has been applied to}} the supplement primary depletion process or as a separate secondary recovery method. Low salinity water injection is a relatively new method that involves injecting low salinity brines at high pressure similar to conventional water-flooding techniques, in order to recover crude oil. The effectiveness of low salinity water injection in sandstone reservoirs depends on a number of parameters such as reservoir temperature, pressure, type of clay particle and salinity of injected brine. Clay particles present on reservoir rock surfaces adsorb polar components of oil and modify wettability of sandstone rocks to the oil-wet state, which is accountable for the reduced recovery rates by conventional water-flooding. The extent of wettability alteration caused by three low salinity brines on oil-wet sandstone samples containing varying clay content (15 % or 30 %) and type of clay (kaolinite/montmorillonite) were analyzed in the laboratory experiment. Contact angles of <b>mica</b> <b>powder</b> and clay mixture (kaolinite/montmorillonite) modified with crude oil were measured before and after injection with three low salinity sodium chloride brines. The effect of temperature was also analyzed for each sample. The results of the experiment indicate that samples with kaolinite clay tend to produce higher contact angles than samples with montmorillonite clay when modified with crude oil. The highest degree or extent of wettability alteration from oil-wet to intermediate-wet state upon injection with low salinity brines was observed for samples injected with brine having salinity concentration of 2000 ppm. The increase in temperature tends to produce contact angles values lying in the higher end of the intermediate-wet range (75 °– 115 °) for samples treated at 50 °C, while their corresponding samples treated at 25 °C produced contact angle values lying in the lower end of intermediate-wet range...|$|R
40|$|Poorly {{water soluble}} {{compounds}} are formulated as nanosuspensions to achieve increased bioavailability, faster onset of action, reduced food effects and decreased side effects. Nanosuspensions offer all these advantages {{due to their}} small size and high surface area and therefore, {{it is critical that}} the particles are maintained in an unaggregated state. Stabilizers {{play an important role in}} the creation of nanosuspensions and preservation of their functionality (thorough prevention of particle growth). In addition, processing conditions can also influence the physical stability of nanosuspensions. In this research, the effect of various factors; preparation method, processing conditions, stabilizer type and drug stabilizer ratio, on the preparation and stability of nanosuspensions was investigated. Furthermore, as stabilizers constitute an important component of these formulations drug:stabilizer interactions were also investigated through a novel atomic force microscopy method. ^ To investigate the effect of the preparation method on the formation and stability of nanosuspensions, ibuprofen nanosuspensions were prepared with various stabilizers using two different techniques: microfluidization (top-down approach); and precipitation (bottom-up approach). The formulations were characterized for particle size and zeta potential. The trends in the initial particle size and short-term stability profile of suspensions prepared with various stabilizers were similar for both processes. HPMC 2 ̆ 7 s were the most effective stabilizers, in achieving both small particle size and short term stability. The superior stabilization efficacy of HPMCs, compared to other non-ionic stabilizers, was attributed to the increased adsorption of the HPMC molecules onto the nanoparticles. Direct evidence of higher surface coverage of ibuprofen nanoparticles with HPMC 2 ̆ 7 s was obtained using a novel atomic force microscopy (AFM) method. Ibuprofen pellets with extremely smooth surfaces were obtained by compressing the drug <b>powder</b> between two <b>mica</b> sheets in a die using Carver press. AFM images clearly showed the superior adsorption characteristics (extent and pattern) of the HPMC layer, compared to PVP and poloxamers. This method provided a unique tool to investigate drug:stabilizer interactions to facilitate nanosuspension stabilizer selection. ^ A half five factorial design was used to investigate the effects of various processing and formulation variables on the preparation of indomethacin (model drug) nanosuspensions using microfluidization. Nanosuspensions were characterized for particle size, zeta potential and physical form of the drug. Critical parameters affecting the particle size obtained can be arranged in the following order of importance; milling time, microfluidization pressure, stabilizer type, temperature and stabilizer type. Various two way interactions affecting the process were also detected in this study. Stability studies of indomethacin nanosuspensions at elevated temperatures were conducted to determine the effect of stabilizer type (small molecule versus polymeric) and micellar solubilized drug on Ostwald ripening. No effect of micellar solubilized drug on Ostwald ripening was observed. The most likely mechanism for Ostwald ripening was determined to be surface nucleation, compared to the more common diffusion controlled mechanism. ...|$|R
