5|$|The {{movement}} for indigenous {{cultural and political}} resurgence in Taiwan traces its roots to the ideals outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). Although the Republic of China was a UN member and signatory to the original UN Charter, four decades of martial law controlled the discourse of culture and politics on Taiwan. The <b>political</b> <b>liberalization</b> Taiwan experienced {{leading up to the}} official end of martial law on July 15, 1987, opened a new public arena for dissenting voices and political movements against the centralized policy of the KMT.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of Szabó’s career {{coincided with the}} {{beginning of}} a “new wave” in Hungarian cinema, one of several new wave cinemas that occurred around this time throughout Western and Eastern Europe. The Eastern European new waves were caused by <b>political</b> <b>liberalization,</b> the decentralization of film industries, and the emergence of films as valuable commodities for export to Western European markets. The resulting films were more formally experimental, politically anti-establishment, and, {{especially in the case of}} Szabó, psychologically probing than the films of the previous generation. Hungarian filmmakers in particular experienced a significant increase in freedom of expression due to the reforms of the Kádár government.|$|E
5|$|While {{there was}} no {{accompanying}} <b>political</b> <b>liberalization,</b> with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country's governance; best known was Gaddafi's son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was openly critical of Libya's human rights record. He led a group who proposed the drafting of the new constitution, although it was never adopted. Involved in encouraging tourism, Saif founded several privately run media channels in 2008, but after criticizing the government they were nationalized in 2009. In October 2010, Gaddafi apologized to African leaders for the historical enslavement of Africans by the Arab slave trade.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the recent {{literature on the}} role of the state in economic development. It concludes that government incentives to enact sound policies are key to economic success. It also {{discusses the}} evidence on what happens after episodes of economic and <b>political</b> <b>liberalizations,</b> asking whether <b>political</b> <b>liberalizations</b> strengthen government incentives to enact sound economic policies. The answer is mixed. Most episodes of economic liberalizations are indeed preceded by <b>political</b> <b>liberalizations.</b> But the countries that have done better are those that have managed to open up the economy first, and only later have liberalized their political system. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies empirically {{the effects}} of and the {{interactions}} amongst economic and <b>political</b> <b>liberalizations.</b> Economic liberalizations are measured by a widely used indicator that captures {{the scope of the}} market in the economy, and in particular of policies towards freer international trade (cf. Sachs and Werner 1995, Wacziarg and Welch 2003). <b>Political</b> <b>liberalizations</b> correspond to the event of becoming a democracy. Using a difference-in-difference estimation, we ask what are {{the effects of}} liberalizations on economic performance, on macroeconomic policy and on structural policies. The main results concern the quantitative relevance of the feedback and interaction effects between the two kinds of reforms. First, we find positive feedback effects between economic and political reforms. The timing of events indicates that causality is more likely to run from <b>political</b> to economic <b>liberalizations,</b> rather than viceversa, but we cannot rule out feedback effects in both directions. Second, the sequence of reforms matters. Countries that first liberalize and then become democracies do much better than countries that pursue the opposite sequence, in almost all dimensions. ...|$|R

5|$|Nasser's {{popularity}} in Egypt and the Arab world skyrocketed after his nationalization of the Suez Canal {{and his political}} victory in the subsequent Suez Crisis. Calls for pan-Arab unity under his leadership increased, culminating {{with the formation of}} the United Arab Republic with Syria (1958–1961). In 1962, Nasser began a series of major socialist measures and modernization reforms in Egypt. Despite setbacks to his pan-Arabist cause, by 1963 Nasser's supporters gained power in several Arab countries, but he became embroiled in the North Yemen Civil War. He began his second presidential term in March 1965 after his political opponents were banned from running. Following Egypt's defeat by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, Nasser resigned, but he returned to office after popular demonstrations called for his reinstatement. By 1968, Nasser had appointed himself prime minister, launched the War of Attrition to regain lost territory, began a process of depoliticizing the military, and issued a set of <b>political</b> <b>liberalization</b> reforms. After the conclusion of the 1970 Arab League summit, Nasser suffered a heart attack and died. His funeral in Cairo drew five million mourners and an outpouring of grief across the Arab world.|$|E

The analysis of Gy 2011 exhumes scientific research done in the field of curriculum studies, which enables future research.

We empirically investigate this cross-sectional and temporal variation in entry liberalization of OECD countries during the 1990 s. A unique data set obtained by merging different sources on political, government and regulatory institutions - as well as private interests and ideologies - allows us to explore in detail several dimensions of the <b>political</b> economy of <b>liberalization.</b> Our findings indicate majoritarian electoral systems as important drivers for change, while independent industry regulators slow down such reforms. Furthermore, powerful industry incumbents hold up the liberalization process and governing bodies that favor a small welfare state accelerate it.
