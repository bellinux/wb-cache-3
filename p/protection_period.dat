40|$|The {{electrochemical}} behaviour of an 80 Sn 20 Zn electro-deposited alloy following passivation in a dichromate {{solution and}} a cerium-containing solution, was studied. It {{was found that}} both the dichromate and cerium passivation procedures {{lead to an increase}} in the corrosion protection afforded by the 80 Sn 20 Zn electro-deposit. This was attributed to a reduction in the rate of the zinc dissolution reaction from the electro-deposit which in turn extended the cathodic <b>protection</b> <b>periods</b> of the deposit. Passivation of the electro-deposited alloy in the cerium-containing solution lead to the precipitation of cerium oxides/hydroxides in a non-uniform manner over the surface. This precipitated film of cerium had the appearance of a cracked-mud layer. Nevertheless, the additional corrosion protection afforded by the cerium passivation treatment was equivalent to that provided by the dichromate passivation treatment...|$|R

Animals from local ponds {{were exposed to}} ambient light plus additional UV-B from lamps in a greenhouse facility. Taxonomic affinities did not appear as major determinants of UV susceptibility, but a major difference in UV-B tolerance was seen between morphotypes with pigmented carapaces and those without, the latter being far more susceptible. Assays on levels of carotene and the anti-oxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase did not reveal clear-cut differences between populations, and could {{not account for the}} higher tolerance in pigmented populations. Levels of glutathione transferase were higher in the transparent population, however. In the absence of blue light and UV, laboratory reared animals did not reconstitute their carapace melanization after moulting, indicating that short-wave light is the cue for melanin synthesis. Tests on melanized individuals and individuals of the same population reared indoors through 1 - 2 moults supported the major role of melanin for UV <b>protection.</b> <b>Periods</b> with high UV exposure during hatching of ephippia could induce shifts in morphotype or clonal dominance...|$|R
