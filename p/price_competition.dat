This involved that the transport of 200,000 people annually would be transferred to scheduled services, resulting in Norway Airlines losing the opportunity to extend its engagement with the military. The route from Oslo to London was introduced on 3 October, at first with four weekly services, increasing to nine from 23 October. The three partner airlines launched their alliance as the TransNordic Group and would use a bowler hat as their common symbol. However, the routes arrived so {{late in the evening}} that the last flights from Fornebu to Trondheim, Bergen, Stavanger and Tromsø had all departed. After five months the airline had achieved a 55-percent cabin factor on the London route. The ministry rejected in December 1991 the airline's application for flying to Stockholm and Copenhagen. By December the British airline Dan-Air had also established itself on the Oslo–London route. To meet the <b>price</b> <b>competition,</b> SAS launched discounted business class tickets. In the course of twelve months from late 1991 to late 1992, the capacity between Oslo and London doubled, as also Norsk Air introduced a service from Sandefjord Airport, Torp.|$|E

30|$|By now, the <b>pricing</b> <b>competition</b> {{problem in}} {{decentralized}} supply chains, initiated in 1980 s [4, 5], {{has been well}} studied by both scholars and practitioners. Most of these researches on the <b>pricing</b> <b>competition</b> problem focus on the following four structures: monopoly common retailer structure [6 – 8], chain-to-chain structure [4, 9, 10], dual channel structure [11 – 14], and monopoly common manufacturer structure, which is studied in this paper. The research on the monopoly common manufacturer structure was initiated by Ingene and Parry [15], considering a coordination problem in a supply chain where a manufacturer sells its products through competing retailers. Ingene and Parry [16] demonstrated that the manufacturer can generally obtain more profits by setting a unique two-part tariff wholesale pricing policy. For <b>pricing</b> <b>competition,</b> Yang et al.[17] considered a pricing problem in a two-echelon supply chain with a manufacturer who supplies a single product to two competing retailers. Assuming that the manufacturer acts as a Stackelberg leader, they explored {{the effects of the}} retailers’ Bertrand and Collusion behaviors on the performance of the supply chain. Wu et al.[18] investigated the pricing decision in this monopoly common manufacturer channel structure and built six noncooperative models where the two retailers play Stackelberg or Bertrand games under three possible power structures. Besides, Huang et al.[19] considered a <b>pricing</b> <b>competition</b> and cooperation problem in a supply chain with one common manufacturer and duopoly retailers and explored the conditions under which the retailers can benefit from their collusion behaviors.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the empirical relationship between market structure and price dispersion {{in the airline}} markets connecting the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Price dispersion is measured {{by a number of}} inequality indexes, calculated using fares posted on the Internet at specific days before takeoff. We find a negative correlation between market dominance and <b>price</b> dispersion; thus <b>competition</b> appears to hinder the airlines' ability to price discriminate to exploit consumers' heterogeneity in booking time preferences. Moreover, in the Christmas and Easter periods of high demand, fares are less dispersed, possibly because airlines target a less heterogenous set of consumers.

30|$|By now, {{considerable}} attentions {{have been}} focused on the <b>pricing</b> <b>competition</b> in totally separate chains as mentioned both from scholars and practitioners. McGuire and Staelin [3] initiated the research and investigated the effects of the substitutability on the structure strategies in duopoly supply chains where each manufacturer distributes its goods through a single exclusive retailer. Coughlan [4] tested results that integration of the marketing functions results in greater <b>pricing</b> <b>competition</b> and lower <b>prices</b> than the use of independent marketing middlemen by survey data from the international semiconductor industry. Recently, Anderson and Bao [5] extended the model of Coughlan [4] from two entirely separate chains to a more general context with arbitrary competing supply chains, and also demonstrated that the underlying market shares play a very important role on the equilibrium behaviors. Li and Li [6] studied the two sustainable supply chains under competition in product sustainability under different structures.|$|R

25|$|Thus the re-organized ND {{was in a}} {{situation}} where it sold PCs, Sintran systems and Unix systems. In January 1990, the business units started negotiating the internal prices. Although top management had originally proposed that the partners could buy services from outside the company and the teams sell outside the company, such transactions were stopped by top management. ServiceTeam achieved high internal prices through the negotiations as they held all the cards. With the introduction of standard hardware platforms, computer manufacturers had to deliver unique software portfolios to avoid a pure <b>price</b> <b>competition.</b> With the spin-off of Notis, ND allowed one of their few competitive advantages to be available for all platforms. The three partner divisions were pure sales divisions and secured all the revenue for the team-divisions and DataShop. However, the partner divisions had very low margins so the profits were being made in the other business units, and thus receiving the praise of top management.|$|E
25|$|The revised {{sequence}} concept {{applies only}} to the industrial system – that is, the manufacturing core {{of the economy in}} which each industry contains only a handful of very powerful corporations. It does not apply to the market system in the Galbraithian dual economy. In the market system, composed of the vast majority of business organizations, <b>price</b> <b>competition</b> remains the dominant form of social control. In the industrial system, however, composed of the 1,000 or so largest corporations, competitive price theory obscures the relation to the price system of these large and powerful corporations. In Galbraith's view, the principal function of market relations in this industrial system is, not to constrain the power of the corporate behemoths, but to serve as an instrument for the implementation of their power. Moreover, the power of these corporations extends into commercial culture and politics, allowing them to exercise considerable influence upon popular social attitudes and value judgments. That this power is exercised in the shortsighted interest of expanding commodity production and the status of the few is both inconsistent with democracy and a barrier to achieving the quality of life that the new industrial state with its affluence could provide.|$|E

The suit was filed in the Southern District of New York and alleges the defendants conspired to restrain retail <b>price</b> <b>competition</b> {{in the sale of}} e-books because they viewed Amazon's price discounting as a substantial challenge to their traditional business model. Regarding Apple in particular, the federal complaint alleged that [...] "Apple facilitated the Publisher Defendants' collective effort to end retail <b>price</b> <b>competition</b> by coordinating their transition to an agency model across all retailers. Apple clearly understood that its participation in this scheme would result in higher prices to consumers." [...] In such an agency-model, publishers set prices rather than sellers. Fifteen states and Puerto Rico also filed a companion federal case in Austin, Texas, against Apple, Penguin, Simon & Schuster and Macmillan. In the same month, HarperCollins, Hachette and Simon & Schuster settled with both the DOJ and the state attorneys general, with HarperCollins and Hachette agreeing to pay Texas and Connecticut $52 million in consumer restitution, leaving Apple, Penguin, and Macmillan as remaining defendants. As of July 2012, the case was still in the discovery stage of litigation. On July 10, 2013, District Court Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan found Apple Inc. guilty of the violation of federal antitrust law, citing [...] "compelling evidence" [...] that Apple played a [...] "central role" [...] in a conspiracy with publishers to eliminate retail competition and the prices of e-books.|$|E
