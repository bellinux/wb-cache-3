25|$|Comparing {{the market}} cost of {{recyclable}} material {{with the cost}} of new raw materials ignores economic externalities—the costs that are currently not counted by the market. Creating a new <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>plastic,</b> for instance, may cause more pollution and be less sustainable than recycling a similar <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>plastic,</b> but these factors will not be counted in market cost. A life cycle assessment can be used to determine the levels of externalities and decide whether the recycling may be worthwhile despite unfavorable market costs. Alternatively, legal means (such as a carbon tax) can be used to bring externalities into the market, so that the market cost of the material becomes close to the true cost.|$|E
25|$|The black-necked stork is a {{carnivore}} and its diet includes water-birds such as coots, little grebes, northern shoveller, pheasant-tailed jacana, and a {{range of}} aquatic vertebrates including fish, amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates such as crabs and molluscs. They also prey on the eggs and hatchlings of turtles. In the Chambal River valley they have been observed to locate nests of Kachuga dhongoka buried under sand (presumably by moistness of the freshly covered nest) and prey on the eggs of the turtle. In Australia, they also forage at night feeding on emerging nestlings of marine turtles. Stomach content analyses of nine storks in Australia showed their diet to contain crabs, molluscs, insects (grasshoppers and beetles), amphibians, reptiles and birds. The storks had also consumed a small <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>plastic,</b> pebbles, cattle dung, and plant material. In well-protected wetlands, both in Australia and India, black-necked storks feed almost exclusively on fish but in the agriculture-dominated landscape of Uttar Pradesh in India they feed on a wider range of prey that include frogs and molluscs; storks obtained fish in wetlands, frogs from roadside ditches and molluscs from irrigation canals.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{marked the}} first time that another {{character}} had joined Dexter with a victim in one of his murder scenes. While filming this scene during October 2008, Smits accidentally stabbed stunt man Jeff Chase with a real knife rather than the scene's prop knife.

2500|$|During May 1988 Hussey was {{the record}} {{producer}} and arranger on Daryl Braithwaite's comeback solo album, Edge, which was issued in November.

Edge peaked at No.1 on the ARIA Albums Chart {{for three weeks}} in mid-1989. Kathryn Whitfield of The Canberra Times felt the album was [...] "Verging on noddy-land, this <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> is soft-sell.

[...] She explained that [...] "Hussey (keyboards) {{appears to have been}} the one to roll up his sleeves and get to work on material for this offering."

2500|$|Early on, AMT chassis {{were often}} made of metal, but later, they were usually a single <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> with lower engine, exhaust and {{suspension}} details molded {{in a single}} piece with metal axles fitted through holes in {{the sides of the}} plastic. Normally, on the chassis, there were no operating suspension parts. Wheels were one-piece plastic pressed onto the axles. With parts typically [...] "melted" [...] together, forming a permanent bond, promotional models were much more durable than their counterpart assembled kits. Of course, promotionals were simpler and had fewer parts than kits which were a later marketing ploy to enhance sales. Hoods did not normally open and suspension details were molded into the chassis. One exception to this was the 1962 Ford Fairlane promo which had an opening hood and a detailed engine (Doty 1999a, pp88-89). Beyond this, extras were not often built in, but there were occasional surprises like the button on the 1959 [...] "Wide Track" [...] Pontiacs which pushed the wheels inward toward the body to simulate how wide the new cars were (Doty 1999b, p87).|$|E

40|$|The {{northern}} fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) {{is defined as}} an indicator species <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> pollution by the Oslo-Paris Convention for the North-East Atlantic, but few data exist for fulmars from Norway. Moreover, the relationship between uptake <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> and pollutants in seabirds is poorly understood. We analyzed samples of fulmars from Norwegian waters and compared the POP concentrations in their liver and muscle tissue with the corresponding concentrations in the loads <b>of</b> ingested <b>plastic</b> in their stomachs, grouped as “no”, “medium” (0. 01 – 0. 21 g; 1 – 14 <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>plastic),</b> or “high” (0. 11 – 0. 59 g; 15 – 106 <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>plastic).</b> POP concentrations in the plastic {{did not differ significantly}} between the high and medium plastic ingestion group for sumPCBs, sumDDTs, and sumPBDEs. By combining correlations among POP concentrations, differences in tissue concentrations <b>of</b> POPs between <b>plastic</b> ingestion subgroups, fugacity calculations, and bioaccumulation modeling, we showed that plastic is more likely to act as a passive sampler than as a vector of POPs, thus reflecting the POP profiles of simultaneously ingested prey...|$|R

Now, without a detonator--a heart--the man might have burned with moderate wrath, but he could not have exploded." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the structural characteristics of solid wastes separation sieve. <b>Pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> film and sandstones with different friction factors and elasticity coefficients are {{chosen as the}} research objects. The motion and the separation mechanism of materials in the sorting process are studied. According to the motion analysis on <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> film and sandstones on solid wastes separation sieve, {{it can be concluded}} that the materials with different friction factors and elasticity coefficients can all be sorted by solid wastes separation sieve. The more difference they have in friction factors and elasticity coefficients, the better separation performance can be achieved. The selection and calculation on the kinetic parameters of solid wastes separation sieve is carried out, which provides the theory evidence for the design of new friction sorting equipment and opens up new prospects for the application of solid wastes separation sieve...|$|R
