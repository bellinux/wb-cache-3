40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the shear bond {{strength}} of orthodontic brackets to enamel in four bonding protocols: SEP without prior <b>pumicing</b> (None), Pre-etch and SEP without prior <b>pumicing</b> (Pre-etch), control: SEP with prior <b>pumicing</b> (Pumice), and Pre-etch and SEP with prior <b>pumicing</b> (Both). 80 extracted bovine incisors were randomly divided into 4 groups of 20, and brackets were bonded under the different experimental conditions. Debonding force was measured with an Instron universal testing machine. A two-way ANOVA comparing the four groups indicated that there was a significant difference in debonding force (P = 0. 001). The SEP without prior <b>pumicing</b> group (17. 69 ± 7. 18 MPa) was statistically different from the SEP group with prior <b>pumicing</b> (25. 82 ± 6. 84 MPa).

40|$|SUMMARY This study {{examines}} the relative success of bonding an attachment to an impacted tooth {{at the time}} of surgical exposure, compared with placing it on a subsequent occasion. In addition, the relative merits of various attachments, the choice of bonding site and whether or not pumice prophylaxis is necessary, were tested. The results showed that bonding {{at the time of}} exposure is superior to its performance at a later date, that the use of an eyelet attachment has a lower failure rate than the use of a conventional bracket, that the palatal aspect offers the poorest bonding surface and that <b>pumicing</b> the exposed tooth offers no advantage over immediate etching of the exposed enamel. The results of this study refute the view that the circumstances prevalent at the time of surgical exposure are not conducive to the reliable bonding of an attachment to an impacted tooth...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Color {{of natural}} teeth changes after {{orthodontic}} treatment. The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate color changes of enamel before and after fixed mechanotherapy and compare the effects of different staining agents on enamel discoloration. Materials and Methods: Hundred freshly extracted premolars were divided into four groups of n = 25 each. Baseline color measurements were taken before bonding through reflectance spectrophotometer (X-Rite i 1 Pro). Postbonding samples were suspended in test solutions; Group 1 (control group) samples stored in distilled water and Group 2, 3, and 4 in tea, coffee, and turmeric solutions, respectively for a week. The samples were then debonded and cleaned with eight fluted tungsten carbide bur followed by <b>pumicing.</b> Color evaluations were made in accordance with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage L* a* b color system. ΔE values were compared for samples before and after debonding. Results: Mean ΔE difference value was found maximum for Group 3 (mean 12. 4560, standard deviation [SD] 4. 7207) and minimum for Group 1 (mean 9. 7120 SD 4. 2009). One-way ANOVA was used for intergroup comparison with P < 0. 05. No statistical significance was found in the ΔE difference values in between the groups. Conclusion: Orthodontic bonding and debonding procedures have an effect on enamel discoloration clinically, although various stains used in the study had no statistical significant difference among themselves...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the shear bond strengths (SBS) of orthodontic brackets bonded with self-etching primer using different enamel surface preparations. A 2 -by- 2 factorial study design was used. Sixty human premolars were harvested, cleaned and randomly assigned to four groups (n= 15 /group). Teeth were bathed in saliva for 48 hours to form a pellicle. Treatments were assigned as follows: Group 1 was pumiced for 10 seconds and pre-etched for five seconds with 37 % phosphoric acid before bonding with self-etching primer (Transbond Plus). Group 2 was pumiced for ten seconds before bonding. Group 3 was pre-etched for five seconds before bonding. Group 4 had no mechanical or chemical preparation before bonding. All teeth were stored in distilled water for 24 hours at 37 oC before debonding. The SBS values and Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) score were recorded. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the enamel changes at each stage of surface preparation and bonding. The SBS values (± 1 SD) for Groups 1 - 4 were 22. 9 ± 6. 1, 16. 1 ± 7. 3, 36. 2 ± 8. 2, and 13. 1 ± 10. 1 MPa, respectively. Two-way ANOVA and subsequent contrasts showed statistically significant differences among treatment groups. ARI scores indicated the majority of adhesive remained on the bracket for all 4 groups. SEM micrographs showed variable enamel surface roughness depending upon preparation. In conclusion, pre-etching the bonding surface for five seconds with 37 % phosphoric acid, instead of <b>pumicing,</b> when using self-etching primers to bond orthodontic brackets, results in greater shear bond strengths...|$|E
40|$|X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopic (XPS) {{and secondary}} ion-mass spectroscopic (SIMS) {{analyses were performed}} on un-ground un-pumiced, unground pumiced, and ground labial enamel surfaces of young bovine incisors exposed to four dif-ferent treatments: (1) immersion in 35 % H 202 for 60 min; (2) immersion in 37 % H 3 PO 4 for 60 s; (3) immersion in 35 % H 202 for 60 min, in distilled water for two mmin and in 37 % H 3 PO 4 for 60 s; (4) immersion in 37 % H 3 PO 4 for 60 s, in distilled water for two min, and in 35 % H 202 for 60 min. Untreated unground un-pumiced, unground pumiced, and ground enamel surfaces, as well as synthetic hydroxyapatite surfaces, served as controls for intra-tooth evaluations {{of the effects of}} different treatments. The analyses indicated that exposure to 35 % H 202 alone, besides increasing the nitrogen content, produced no other significant change in the elemental composition of any of the enamel surfaces investigated. Exposure to 37 % H 3 PO 4, however, produced a marked decrease in calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and an increase in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations in unground un-pumiced specimens only, and a decrease in C concentration in ground specimens. These results suggest that the reported decrease in the adhesive bond strength of resin to 35 % H 202 -treated enamel is not caused by a change in the elemental composition of treated enamel surfaces. They also suggest that an organic-rich layer, unaffected by acid-etching, may be present on the unground u-n-pumiced surface of young bovine incisors. This layer can be removed by thorough <b>pumicing</b> or by grinding. An awareness of its presence is important when young bovine teeth are used in a model system for evaluation of resin adhesiveness...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{investigated}} the effect of dentin treatment with iodine potassium iodide, calcium hydroxide or a biphenol-A- diglycidylether epoxy resin sealer on the dentin bond strength of titanium-reinforced Bis-GMA and urethane dimethacrylate composite materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dentin was exposed in four groups of extracted teeth (20 specimens each). Three groups were treated {{with one of the}} contaminants and the fourth group was left uncovered and served as the control group. All specimens were stored for 1 week at 37 degrees C and 100 % humidity. The dentin surfaces were cleaned with pumice slurry using a prophylaxis rubber cup, rinsed and dried. Then the dentin surfaces were treated using the conditioner and the primer of the GLUMA adhesive system followed by placement of composite core materials. After 20 minutes, debonding of the core materials was accomplished using a shear-peel test. A two-way analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple range test was performed based upon core type and contaminant type (alpha = 0. 05). RESULTS: Titanium-reinforced Bis-GMA composite showed significantly greater bond strength values than the urethane dimethacrylate composite material (p < 0. 0001). The mean bond strength values in megapascals for the Bis-GMA resin ranged from 8. 47 +/- 1. 52 for the calcium hydroxide group to 9. 81 +/- 0. 94 for the control group. Mean bond strengths for the urethane dimethacrylate resin ranged from 3. 35 +/- 0. 90 for calcium hydroxide to 3. 99 +/- 0. 88 for iodine potassium iodide groups. Within each core group, no difference in bond strengths were noted compared to the uncontaminated control. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment of the dentin with iodine potassium iodide, calcium hydroxide, or epoxy resin followed by <b>pumicing</b> and using the GLUMA system conditioner and primer had no effect on the bond strength of the two resin composite core materials. However, the titanium reinforced Bis-GMA composite exhibited significantly greater bond strength to dentin than the urethane dimethacrylate based composite. King Saud Universit...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSilicic <b>pumices</b> formed during {{explosive}} {{volcanic eruptions}} are faithful recorders {{of the state}} of the magma in the conduit, close to or at the fragmentation level. We have characterized four types of <b>pumices</b> from the non-welded rhyolitic Kos Plateau Tuff, which erupted 161, 000 years ago in the East Aegean Arc, Greece. The dominant type of pumice (> 90 vol. %) shows highly elongated tubular vesicles. These tube <b>pumices</b> occur throughout the eruption. Less common pumice types include: (1) “frothy” pumice (highly porous with large, sub-rounded vesicles), which form 5 – 10 vol. % of the coarsest pyroclastic flow deposits, (2) dominantly “microvesicular” and systematically crystal-poor <b>pumices,</b> which are found in early erupted, fine-grained pyroclastic flow units, and are characterized by many small (< 50 μm in diameter) vesicles and few mm-sized, irregular voids, (3) grey or banded <b>pumices,</b> indicating the interaction between the rhyolite and a more mafic magma, which are found throughout the eruption sequence and display highly irregular bubble shapes. Except for the grey-banded <b>pumices,</b> all three other types are compositionally identical and were generated synchronously as they are found in the same pyroclastic units. They, therefore, record different conditions in the volcanic conduit leading to variable bubble nucleation, growth and coalescence. A total of 74 pumice samples have been characterized using thin section observation, SEM imagery, porosimetry, and permeametry. We show that the four pumice types have distinct total and connected porosity, tortuosity and permeability. Grey-banded <b>pumices</b> show large variations in petrophysical characteristics as a response to mingling of two different magmas. The microvesicular, crystal-poor, <b>pumices</b> have a bimodal bubble size distribution, interpreted as reflecting an early heterogeneous bubble nucleation event followed by homogeneous bubble nucleation close to fragmentation. Finally, the significant differences in porosity, tortuosity and permeability in compositionally identical tube and frothy <b>pumices</b> are the result of variable shear rates in different parts of the conduit. Differential shear rates may be the result of either: (1) pure shear, inducing a vertical progression from frothy to tube and implying a relatively thick fragmentation zone to produce both types of <b>pumices</b> at the same time or (2) localized simple shear, inducing strongly tubular vesicles along the wall and near-spherical bubbles in the centre of the conduit and not necessarily requiring a thick fragmentation zone...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSoufrière Hills Volcano had {{two periods}} of {{repetitive}} Vulcanian activity in 1997, during which 88 explosions occurred. Each explosion discharged {{the contents of}} the upper 0. 5 - 2 km of the conduit, two thirds as pyroclastic flows and the rest as fallout from 3 - 15 km high buoyant plumes: frothy <b>pumices</b> from a deep, gas-rich zone, lava and breadcrust bombs from a degassed lava plug, and dense <b>pumices</b> from a transition zone. Vesicles constitute 1 - 66 vol% of breadcrust bombs and 24 - 79 % of <b>pumices,</b> all those larger than a few tens of µm being interconnected. Small vesicles (few hundreds of µm) in <b>pumices</b> are interpreted as pre-dating explosion, implying pre-explosive conduit porosities up to 55 %. About 15 % of large vesicles in <b>pumices,</b> and all those in breadcrust bombs, are angular voids formed by syn-explosive fracturing of amphibole phenocrysts. An intermediate-sized vesicle population formed by coalescence of the small syn-explosive bubbles. Nucleation took place heterogeneously on titanomagnetite, number densities of which greatly exceed those of vesicles, and bubble growth took place mainly by decompression. Growth took place under disequilibrium conditions largely by decompression-driven expansion; diffusive outgassing of melt was limited by the short timescale of the explosions, accounting for the high water contents preserved in matrix glasses. Development of vesicle textures was controlled by the time interval between decompression and onset of clast-surface cooling. Plug fragments entered the air quickly after fragmentation (~ 10 s), so interiors continued to vesiculate once the rinds had quenched. A larger time interval for deep-derived <b>pumices</b> (~ 50 s) allowed complete vesiculation prior to quench, accounting for the textural similarity between flow and fall <b>pumices,</b> despite different thermal histories after leaving the vent. This also allowed syn-explosive coalescence to proceed further in <b>pumices</b> than in the breadcrust bombs. Uniaxial boudinage of some amphiboles implies significant syn-explosive vesiculation of <b>pumices</b> even prior to magma fragmentation and suggests that vesiculation in <b>pumices</b> have been largely confined to the conduit. Syn-explosive decompression rates estimated from vesicle number densities are consistent with those predicted by numerical models. These decompression rates are also consistent with the idea that syn-explosive bubble nucleation during the 1997 explosions was initiated during rapid decompression of conduit magma in a zone of steep pressure gradient beneath the descending fragmentation level...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAB: Silicic <b>pumices</b> formed during {{explosive}} {{volcanic eruptions}} are faithful recorders {{of the state}} of the magma in the conduit, close to the fragmentation level, as viscosity is generally high enough to limit their post-fragmentation deformation to a minimum. Pumice textures are therefore of great interest to shed light into bubble nucleation, growth and coalescence in silicic magmas ascending in a volcanic conduit, which ultimately controls the style of eruption. In this study, we have characterised the <b>pumices</b> produced by the rhyolitic 161 ka Kos Plateau Tuff (KPT) eruption, Aegean Arc, Greece. Four types of <b>pumices</b> were distinguished macroscopically in the non-welded deposits, and have been characterized using thin section observation, SEM imagery, porosimetry, and permeametry. We show that the types of <b>pumices</b> defined are confirmed by distinct petrophysical characteristics, and the measured differences in porosity and permeability are the result of either conduit processes, differences in crystallinity or magma mixing. We also show that permeability does not depend solely on porosity, as implied by the percolation theory.

40|$|X-ray {{computed}} microtomography (µCT) {{was applied}} to <b>pumices</b> from the largest Quaternary explosive eruption of the active South Aegean Arc (the Kos Plateau Tuff; KPT) {{in order to better}} understand magma permeability within volcanic conduits. Two different types of <b>pumices</b> (one with highly elongated bubbles, tube pumice; and the other with near spherical bubbles, frothy pumice) produced synchronously and with identical chemical composition were selected for µCT imaging to obtain porosity, tortuosity, bubble size and throat size distributions. Tortuosity drops on average from 2. 2 in frothy pumice to 1. 5 in tube pumice. Bubble size and throat size distributions provide estimates for mean bubble size (~ 93 – 98 μm) and mean throat size (~ 23 – 29 μm). Using a modified Kozeny-Carman equation, variations in porosity, tortuosity, and throat size observed in KPT <b>pumices</b> explain the spread found in laboratory measurements of the Darcian permeability. Measured difference in inertial permeability between tube and frothy <b>pumices</b> can also be partly explained by the same variables but require an additional parameter related to the internal roughness of the porous medium (friction factor f 0).

40|$|Graduation Date: 1985 Presentation date: 1984 - 05 - 04 Two ash-flow tuff {{units of}} the late Miocene-early Pliocene Deschute Formation in central Oregon were studied in detail because of the {{widespread}} distribution, diverse compositions, and stratigraphic importance. The Lower Bridge tuff is a double-flow simple cooling unit that is poorly welded. The upper flow grades from rhyolite in the lower part to dacite in the upper part. A white 1. 5 to 5 -foot accretionary lapilli air-fall deposit often underlies the two ash-flow sequences. Phenocrysts in the pumice lumps are plagioclase (An 35 - 45), pargasite, hypersthene, augite, ilmenite, apatite, and magnetite. The compositional charge from rhyolite to dacite in the upper flow suggests that it was formed by eruption of successively lower parts of a zoned magma body. The McKenzie Canyon tuff is a multiple flow compound cooling unit that overlies the Lower Bridge tuff. It may have covered 160 square km and had a volume of 0. 7 km 3. It was erupted onto irregular terrain resulting in variable thicknesses. Up to three light-colored, rhyolitic ash-flow deposits are overlain by two red columnar-jointed units. The red color and welding of the upper two members are the distinguishing physical features of the McKenzie Canyon tuff. The lower nonresistant silicic flows are often absent {{in the northern part}} of the study area. The facts that the units decrease in thickness and in elevation northward and that the average pumice size becomes smaller suggests a source to the south. Another distinguishing feature of the upper red flow(s) is. the prevalence of white (rhyolite), black (andesite), banded (rhyolite and andesite), and collapsed <b>pumices.</b> A few dacite pumice clasts (mixed) are also present. In the lower silicic flows black or banded <b>pumices</b> are only found in minor amounts and collapsed <b>pumices</b> are absent. Collapsed <b>pumices</b> in the upper flow(s) only occur throughout the welded section in nearly horizontal orientations. The white pumice is a high-K rhyolite with phenocrysts of. oligoclase/andesine (An 29 - 31), hypersthene, augite, magnetite, ilmenite, and zircon. The black pumice is medium-K, hi-Ti and -Fe andesite that contains labradorite (An 60 - 65), olivine (Fo 82), augite, hypersthene, and magnetite. The percentage of black pumice increases upward in the upper flow. Banded pumice is a combination of rhyolite and andesite magmas and represents the coeruption of these two compositions. Evidence of complete mixing of the magmas i. e., homogeneous dacite pumice, is minor, Collapsed <b>pumices</b> have the same composition as rhyolite or banded <b>pumices.</b> The McKenzie Canyon tuff was possibly derived from two separate magams. As mafic magma was injected into a silicic magma chamber, ensuing convection and vesiculation probably caused the formation of banded pumice. This hypothesis is based on the following relationships: 1) phenocrysts and bulk chemistry of rhyolite and andesitic <b>pumices</b> are of distinct compositions, 2) a paucity of phenocrysts occur in the andesitic <b>pumices,</b> and 3) Harker diagrams of major element chemistries show that the two magmas have divergent regression lines. The McKenzie Canyon tuff upper flows are unusual among banded pumice-bearing tuffs because of the aphyric nature of the andesite and the probability that the rhyolite and andesite magmas are not derived from the same magma chamber...|$|R

Pumice sample PST- 9 comes from a fallout deposit older than a spatter agglutinate sequence emplaced during the twentieth century. The eruption that produced it had a size exceeding that of intermediate paroxysms but was smaller than large-scale, spatter-forming, paroxysms from the sixteenth century and 1930 A. D. Lapilli are strongly vesicular and crystal-poor, similar to other "golden" <b>pumices.</b> Modal proportions include 89 vol% glass, 8 vol% clinopyroxene, 1 - 2 vol% olivine and 1 - 2 vol% plagioclase. Plagioclase is represented by reacted crystals coming from the shallow resident magma and incorporated in the pumice during eruption. A total of 74 and 44 crystals of olivine and clinopyroxene, respectively, were examined and 187 and 99 electron microprobe analyses obtained. Fo in olivine ranges between 70 and 92 mol% and Fs in clinopyroxene between 3 and 13 mol%. PST- 9 hosts {{a higher proportion of}} Fo-rich olivine and Fs-poor clinopyroxene than the other "golden" <b>pumices.</b> Groundmass glasses are basaltic (Mg# = 66 - 69), as are most rim glasses around olivine and clinopyroxene, and glass inclusions in clinopyroxene. They are more primitive than in the other "golden" <b>pumices.</b> A few rim glasses and glass inclusions are shoshonitic (Mg# = 45 - 50). Most glass inclusions in olivine have CaO/Al 2 O 3 higher than the other glasses and the whole-rock. PST- 9 has the highest bulk MgO, CaO, Mg# and CaO/Al 2 O 3 and the lowest FeOt of all "golden" <b>pumices</b> analysed to date. Analysis of Fe-Mg partitioning between olivine, clinopyroxene and melt allows three crystallization stages to be recognized. The first involves primitive mantle-derived melts (Mg# = 74 - 80), the second basaltic melts represented by groundmass glasses and the third is associated with more evolved melts represented by the shoshonitic glasses. The population of crystals in "golden" <b>pumices</b> is heterogeneous not only because of crystal incorporation from the shallow resident magma, but also because of pre-eruptive recharge of the deep reservoir with primitive melts. Differences between PST- 9 and the other "golden" <b>pumices</b> in terms of groundmass glass composition and distribution of olivine and clinopyroxene compositions reflect contrasted replenishment rates of the deep reservoir with primitive liquids. Gabbroic inclusions in a clinopyroxene crystal provide a direct illustration of melt wall-rock interaction and stress the variability of the deep reservoir in terms of temperature, crystallinity and phase assemblages. Deep crystallization of plagioclase should be considered as a possibility at Stromboli. PST- 9 is exceptionally well representative of the early magmatic evolution of "golden" <b>pumices...</b>|$|R

The connected porosity varies {{over a wide range}} from 3 to 62 %. The unconnected porosity is important only on <b>pumices</b> where it can reach 15 %. The permeability covers more than 5 orders of magnitude, ranging from 10 À 16 to 35 Â 10 À 12 m 2. The higher values are obtained on lava blocks and the scoriae, even if these rocks are less porous than the <b>pumices.</b> The formation factor ranges from 7 to 1139. The transport properties of these rocks are slightly correlated with porosity. This indicates that these properties are not only controlled by the connected porosity. To connect the transport properties to the textural characteristics of the pore network of pyroclastic rocks, different models, based on geometrical considerations or percolation theory, were tested. The pore access radius distribution and the tortuosity control the transport properties of pyroclastic rocks. Consequently, the models (electric and hydraulic) based on the concept of percolation (e. g., the models of Katz and Thompson), apply better than the equivalent channel model of Kozeny-Carman.

Less than 300 min were needed to achieve 99 and 92 % desorption of the adsorbed Ca 2 + and 100 and 89 % of the adsorbed Mg 2 + from the natural and modified <b>pumices,</b> respectively. After treating synthetic water solution simulating an actual water stream with the alkali-modified pumice, total hardness of the treated sample met the required standard for drinking water, namely below 300 mg/L of CaCO 3 (297. 5 mg/L). The studied pumice adsorbents, and especially the treated pumice, can be therefore considered as promising low cost adsorbents, suitable for the removal of hardness ions from drinking water...|$|R
40|$|Pumice {{particles}} {{represent the}} basic "ingredient'' of many large explosive eruptions and form {{as a result}} of magma fragmentation inside the conduit. At the onset of eruption, fragmental <b>pumices</b> are expelled at high velocity from the crater by the overpressure of gas liberated on explosion. The resulting multiphase flow is forced through atmosphere by a variety of transportation mechanisms and <b>pumices</b> eventually decouple from the gas flow, settling down to form pyroclastic deposits. Here we propose new experimental data of terminal velocity together with a quantitative shape analysis {{of a wide range of}} pumice particles. The resulting model allows predicting the terminal velocity of pumice by means of easily measured particle characteristics, with an average error of 12 %, which compares favourably with previous models...|$|R
40|$|A {{peculiar}} {{feature of}} the Sabatini Volcanic District (SVD, central Italy) is the occurrence of crystal-poor <b>pumices</b> and crystal-rich enclaves within the same eruptive host-deposit. The stratigraphic sequence of <b>pumices</b> and enclaves indicates the tapping of a stratified magma chamber, where a crystal-poor phonolitic magma lay {{on top of a}} more primitive crystal-rich magma. The crystal-rich enclaves are genetically related to the <b>pumices</b> and record the evolution of a solidification front, in which a more differentiated melt was produced, extracted and eventually erupted. We collected and analyzed crystal-rich enclaves from one of the largest phonolitic eruptions at the SVD and used their petrological and geochemical features to reconstruct magma differentiation and crystal-melt separation in the solidification front. On this basis, three groups of enclaves have been identified: porphyritic enclaves, holocrystalline enclaves and sanidinites. The mineralogical variability faithfully reproduces the spatial and temporal evolution expected of a solidification front, from early-to-intermediate crystallization conditions (porphyritic and holocrystalline type) to the late stage of solidification (sanidinites), in which the percolation of a more differentiated melt through the crystal mush triggered the instability of the solidification front. Results from numerical models indicate that gravitational instability is the most efficient mechanism to explain melt extraction in mush zones of medium-sized (~ 10 km 3), short-lived (~ 104 years) magma chambers...|$|R

The Rattlesnake Ash-Flow Tuff erupted 7. 05 ± 0. 01 Ma {{from the western}} Harney Basin, southeastern Oregon. The location of the vent area is inferred based on vent-ward increases in size of <b>pumices,</b> in degree of welding, and in degree of post-emplacement crystallization. Today's outcrops cover 9000 km 2 and estimated original outcrop coverage was ca. 35000 km 2. Tuff thickness is uniform ranging mainly between 5 and 30 in with maxima up to 70 in. Estimated eruption volume is 280 km 3 dense rock equivalent (DRE). Lithological variations include vitric non- to densely welded tuff, vapor-phase, devitrified, spherulitic, lithophysal, and rheomorphic tuff. Lithological zoning characteristics of the tuff change locally at nearly constant tuff thickness over distances of 1 to 3 km grading from incipiently welded tuff to highly zoned sections. Regional variations become apparent by integrating many sections from one area. A three-dimensional facies model is developed describing the local and regional facies variations. The Rattlesnake Tuff consists of high-silica rhyolite (HSR) erupted as <b>pumices</b> and glass shards. Dacite <b>pumices</b> make up less than 1...|$|R
40|$|The recent eruptive {{history on}} the island of Tenerife is {{characterized}} in part by the presence of zoned phonolitic ignimbrites, some of which prominently display two types of juvenile clasts (i. e. light-colored, aphyric <b>pumices</b> alongside darker, more crystal-rich <b>pumices,</b> here dubbed ‘crystal-poor' and ‘crystal-rich', respectively). Petrographic observation of the crystal-rich <b>pumices</b> reveals intensely resorbed and intergrown mineral textures, consistent with the system reaching a high crystallinity, followed by perturbation and remobilization prior to eruption. Some trace elements show anomalous concentrations in such crystal-rich <b>pumices</b> (e. g. bulk Ba[*]>[*] 2000 [*]ppm alongside low Zr and a positive Eu anomaly) indicative of crystal accumulation (of feldspar[*]±[*]biotite). Many biotite and feldspar crystals are reversely zoned, with rim concentrations that are high in Ba but low in Sr, implying crystallization from an ‘enriched' melt, potentially derived from remobilization by partial melting of the aforementioned cumulate zones. Given (1) the presence of cumulates in the eruptive record on Tenerife and a bimodality of pumice textures, (2) the presence of three dominant compositions (basanite, phonotephrite, phonolite, separated by compositional gaps) in the volcanic record, and (3) abundant support for crystal fractionation as the dominant drive for magmatic evolution in Tenerife, it is hypothesized that crystal-poor magmas are extracted from mushy reservoirs in both the lower and upper crust. The thermodynamic software MELTS is used to test a polybaric differentiation model whereby phonolites (sensu lato) are generated by extraction of residual liquids from an intermediate-crystallinity phonotephritic mush in the upper crust, which is in turn generated from the residual liquids of an intermediate-crystallinity basanitic mush at deeper levels. Latent heat spikes following crystallization of successive phases in the upper crustal reservoir provide a thermal buffering mechanism to slow down cooling and crystallization, permitting enhanced melt extraction at a particular crystallinity interval (mostly ∼ 40 - 60 [*]vol. % crystals). MELTS modeling typically fits the observed chemical data adequately, although some major elements (mostly Al 2 O 3) also indicate partial ‘cannibalization' of feldspar along with some magma mixing (and potentially minor crustal contamination...|$|R

In this study, we obtained 3 D images of different pumice types found in the rhyolitic Kos Plateau Tuff (KPT) deposits (160 ky, South Aegean Arc, Greece), and combined anisotropy and (geometrical) tortuosity measurements of these scans with permeability data to gain insights into the development of pathways through magmatic foam and how it affects syn-eruptive degassing. The rhyolitic KPT <b>pumices</b> are particularly prone to textural analysis because (1) the deposits are non-welded, (2) the high viscosity of the magma helped preserving information {{on the state of}} the magmatic foam in the conduit immediately prior to fragmentation (i. e., disruption of magma into pyroclastic fragments) and (3) <b>pumices</b> display variable macroscopic textures including tubular and near-spherical networks of bubbles. The stacks of grey-scale μCT images were cropped and segmented to obtain 3 D binary volumes. These volumes were submitted to anisotropy and tortuosity measurements using existing softwares. Results suggest a significantly more convoluted path through the spherical bubble networks than the tubular bubble networks. To complement this geometrical characterisation of <b>pumices,</b> permeability values on the same binary volumes will be acquired using two numerical codes (one is based on a Finite Difference scheme, the other using the Lattice Boltzmann technique) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{concentration}} of dissolved volatile species in silicic pyroclasts, especially that of water, can yield key information about magma degassing and fragmentation depths. However, post-eruptive hydration {{can be highly}} problematic, with meteoric water overprinting magmatic water contents, especially in fine-grained or highly porous samples that have large surface area to volume ratios. In this study we have used thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectroscopy (TGA-MS) to characterize the volatile contents and degassing behaviour of a selection of juvenile pyroclasts and ashes erupted from Chaitén volcano, Chile in May-June 2008. The advantage of the selected samples is the short delay between eruption and collection (days to weeks), meaning that post-eruptive hydration ought to be minimal. The samples analysed, which were collected from proximal fallout deposits in June 2008, include a suite of centimetric <b>pumices</b> and obsidian clasts of varying porosity, the < 250 μm ash fraction of the matrix, and a lapilli tuff. Samples were powdered to 125 - 500 μm and heated at 5 °C/min to 1250 °C after an initial 12 hour purge. Additionally, aliquots of ash samples were hydrated in distilled water for up to 3 months. The results indicate that <b>pumices</b> and obsidian samples have a similar total volatile content (0. 7 - 1. 6 wt %), which is dominated by water. The temperature of most rapid weight loss (dTGA peak) was significantly lower in the <b>pumices</b> (550 - 700 °C) than the dense obsidians (850 - 1000 °C), reflecting their greater surface area for diffusive degassing. Relationships between dTGA peak temperatures and total volatile contents are therefore different for <b>pumices</b> and obsidians, and results plot close to the non-hydrated obsidian endmember of Denton et al. (2009). Experimentally hydrated ash had two clearly separate dTGA peaks at 184 - 211 °C and 517 - 542 °C, which represent external and magmatic water respectively. The low-temperature peak is almost completely missing from natural samples, confirming that negligible post-eruptive hydration has occurred and indicating that the magmatic volatile content of even ashes and pumiceous clasts can be measured using bulk extraction techniques. Preliminary calculations of absolute water and CO 2 concentrations from mass spectrometer data provide rough estimates of magma quenching depths to between 200 - 800 m beneath the surface, whilst pyroclast textures imaged in thin section and using scanning electron microscopy indicate heterogenous foam collapse to form dense <b>pumices</b> and obsidians. These results help {{to shed light on}} magma degassing during the ongoing Chaitén eruption and demonstrate that the bulk water content of freshly-collected pyroclasts may indeed be untainted by meteoric hydration.

We focus here on the fallout deposits of the pyroclastic succession emplaced during this eruption. We present major and trace element data on the bulk <b>pumices,</b> along with major and volatile element data on clinopyroxene-hosted melt inclusions, in order to assess the conditions of storage, ascent, and eruption of the feeding trachytic magma. Crystal fractionation accounts for the evolution from trachyte to alkali-trachyte magmas; these were intimately mingled (at the micrometer scale) during the climactic phase of the eruption. The Averno 2 alkali trachyte represents one of the most evolved magmas erupted within the Phlegraean Fields area and belongs to the series of differentiated trachytic magmas erupted at different locations 5 ka ago. Melt inclusions record significant variations in H 2 O (from 0. 4 to 5 wt%), S (from 0. 01 to 0. 06 wt%), Cl (from 0. 75 up to 1 wt%), and F (from 0. 20 to > 0. 50 wt%) during both magma crystallization and degassing.
