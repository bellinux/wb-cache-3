25|$|Concerning {{more serious}} afflictions, the complex origins of {{myoclonus}} may {{be treated with}} multiple drugs, which have a limited effect individually, but greater when combined with others that act on different brain pathways or mechanisms. Treatment is most effective when the underlying cause is known, and can be treated as such. Some drugs being studied in different combinations include clonazepam, sodium valproate, <b>piracetam,</b> and primidone. Hormonal therapy may improve responses to antimyoclonic drugs in some people.|$|E
25|$|When {{patients}} are taking multiple medications, the discontinuation of drugs suspected of causing myoclonus {{and treatment of}} metabolic derangements may resolve some cases of myoclonus. When pharmacological treatment is indicated anticonvulsants are the main line of treatment. Paradoxical reactions to treatment are notable. Drugs which most people respond to may in other individuals worsen their symptoms. Sometimes {{this leads to the}} mistake of increasing the dose, rather than decreasing or stopping the drug. Treatment of myoclonus focuses on medications that may help reduce symptoms. Drugs used include sodium valproate, clonazepam, the anticonvulsant levetiracetam, and <b>piracetam.</b> Dosages of clonazepam usually are increased gradually until the patient improves or side effects become harmful. Drowsiness and loss of coordination are common side effects. The beneficial effects of clonazepam may diminish over time if the patient develops a tolerance to the drug.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Piracetam</b> {{has been}} found to have very few side effects, and those it has are {{typically}} [...] "few, mild, and transient." [...] A large-scale, 12-week trial of high-dose <b>piracetam</b> found no adverse effects occurred in the group taking <b>piracetam</b> as compared to the placebo group. Many other studies have likewise found <b>piracetam</b> to be well tolerated.|$|E
50|$|In {{studies with}} aged rats, marked {{improvement}} {{has been observed}} in cognitive tasks in experimental groups given <b>piracetam.</b> Performance was further increased with <b>piracetam</b> combined with cholines. Evidence in studies with rats has indicated that the potency of <b>piracetam</b> is increased when administered with choline.|$|E
50|$|A 2001 Cochrane review {{concluded}} that there was not enough evidence to support <b>piracetam</b> for dementia or cognitive problems. A 2002 review and 2005 review {{concluded that}} <b>piracetam</b> had some positive effects in older patients with these problems. In 2008, a working group of the British Academy of Medical Sciences noted that many of the trials of <b>piracetam</b> for dementia were flawed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Piracetam</b> {{improves}} {{the function of}} the neurotransmitter acetylcholine via muscarinic cholinergic (ACh) receptors, which are implicated in memory processes. Furthermore, <b>piracetam</b> may have an effect on NMDA glutamate receptors, which are involved with learning and memory processes. <b>Piracetam</b> is thought to increase cell membrane permeability. <b>Piracetam</b> may exert its global effect on brain neurotransmission via modulation of ion channels (i.e., Na+, K+). It has been found to increase oxygen consumption in the brain, apparently in connection to ATP metabolism, and increases the activity of adenylate kinase in rat brains. <b>Piracetam,</b> while in the brain, appears to increase the synthesis of cytochrome b5, which {{is a part of the}} electron transport mechanism in mitochondria. But in the brain, it also increases the permeability of the mitochondria of some intermediaries of the Krebs cycle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Piracetam</b> is {{primarily}} used in Europe, Asia, and South America. In the United States, {{it is not}} approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for any medical use {{and it is not}} permitted to be sold as a dietary supplement. <b>Piracetam</b> is legal to import into the United Kingdom for personal use with or without prescription. <b>Piracetam</b> has no DIN in Canada, and thus cannot be sold but can be imported for personal use in Canada. It has become popular as a cognitive enhancement drug among students.|$|E
5000|$|Antagonists: CNQX, Ethanol, Kynurenic acid, NBQX, Perampanel, <b>Piracetam,</b> etc.|$|E
5000|$|... the {{pyrrolidine}} derivative racetam {{drugs such}} as <b>piracetam</b> and aniracetam ...|$|E
50|$|The most {{effect has}} been shown by <b>piracetam</b> and amphetamine, which may {{increase}} cerebral plasticity and result in an increased capability to improve language function. It has been seen that <b>piracetam</b> is most effective when treatment is begun immediately following stroke. When used in chronic cases it has been much less efficient.|$|E
50|$|The {{nootropic}} drug <b>piracetam</b> {{appears to}} significantly reduce accumulation of lipofuscin {{in the brain}} tissue of rats.|$|E
50|$|Like some ampakines, some racetams such as <b>piracetam</b> and {{aniracetam}} {{are positive}} allosteric modulators of the AMPA receptor.|$|E
50|$|Racetams, such as <b>piracetam,</b> oxiracetam, and aniracetam, are {{structurally}} similar compounds, {{which are}} often marketed as cognitive enhancers and sold over-the-counter. Racetams are {{often referred to as}} nootropics, but this property of the drug class is not well established. The racetams have poorly understood mechanisms of action; however, <b>piracetam</b> and aniracetam are known to act as positive allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors and appear to modulate cholinergic systems.|$|E
5000|$|Piracetam's {{mechanism}} of action, as with racetams in general, {{is not fully}} understood. The drug influences neuronal and vascular functions and influences cognitive function without acting as a sedative or stimulant. <b>Piracetam</b> is a positive allosteric modulator of the AMPA receptor. It is hypothesized to act on ion channels or ion carriers, thus leading to increased neuron excitability. GABA brain metabolism and GABA receptors are not affected by <b>piracetam</b> ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Piracetam</b> is {{sold under}} {{a wide variety}} of brand names worldwide. Popular trade names for <b>piracetam</b> in Europe are Nootropil and Lucetam, among many others. In Argentina, it is made by GlaxoSmithKline S.A. {{laboratories}} and sold under the trade name of Noostan (800 mg or 1200 mg). In Venezuela and Ecuador, <b>piracetam</b> is produced by Laboratorios Farma S.A. and sold under the brand name Breinox. In Mexico it is produced by UCB de Mexico, and sold under the brand name of Nootropil. Other names include Nootropil in the United States, Europe, Brazil, Hong Kong, India, and Mexico; Lucetam, Oikamid, Smart, Geratam, and Biotropil in Europe and Brazil; Neurobasal in Colombia; Breinox in Ecuador and Venezuela;Stimulan in Egypt; and Nocetan in Latin America.|$|E
50|$|It {{shares the}} same {{2-oxo-pyrrolidone}} base structure with pyroglutamic acid. <b>Piracetam</b> is a cyclic derivative of GABA (gamma-Aminobutyric acid).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Piracetam</b> [...] - [...] {{mechanism}} {{not fully}} understood, but most likely interacts with cholinergic and glutamatergic receptors, among others ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Piracetam</b> {{was first}} made some {{time between the}} 1950s and 1964. There are reports of it being used for {{epilepsy}} in the 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|Methylphenylpiracetam is a {{derivative}} of <b>piracetam</b> {{and a positive}} allosteric modulator of the sigma-1 receptor. It differs from phenylpiracetam by having a methyl group.|$|E
5000|$|Phenylpiracetam — a phenylated analog of {{the drug}} <b>piracetam</b> which was {{developed}} in 1983 in Russia where it is available as a prescription drug.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} an API being studied would be that of <b>Piracetam,</b> or (2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)acetamide, {{which is used to}} stimulate the central nervous system and thus, enhance {{learning}} and memory. Four polymorphs of <b>Piracetam</b> exist that involve hydrogen bonding of the carbonyl and primary amide. It is these same hydrogen bonding functional groups that interact with and enhance the cocrystallization of <b>Piracetam</b> with gentisic acid, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and with p-hydroxybenzoic acid, an isomer of the aspirin precursor salicylic acid. No matter what the API is that is being researched, it is quite evident of the wide applicability and possibility for constant improvement in the realm of drug development, thus making it clear that the driving force of cocrystallization continues to consist of attempting to improve on the physical properties in which the existing cocrystals are lacking.|$|E
50|$|<b>Piracetam</b> (and other racetams), α-GPC and choline {{are known}} to {{activate}} the cholinergic system and alleviate cognitive symptoms caused by extended use of anticholinergic drugs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Piracetam</b> (sold under many brand names) is a {{medication}} in the racetams group, with chemical name 2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide. It {{is used in}} Europe, Asia and South America. In the United States, it is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for any medical use {{and it is not}} permitted to be sold as a dietary supplement. [...] In the UK, <b>piracetam</b> is prescribed mainly for myoclonus, but is used off-label for other conditions. Evidence to support its use for many conditions is unclear.|$|E
50|$|Ergoloids {{are also}} used by many people as a nootropic. It {{may be used in}} {{conjunction}} with other cerebral enhancers like <b>piracetam,</b> with which it may act synergistically.|$|E
50|$|Vincamine {{is often}} used as a {{nootropic}} agent to combat the effects of aging, or {{in conjunction with other}} nootropics (such as <b>piracetam)</b> for a variety of purposes.|$|E
50|$|Some sources {{suggest that}} piracetam's overall effect on {{lowering}} {{depression and anxiety}} is higher than on improving memory. However, depression {{is reported to be}} an occasional adverse effect of <b>piracetam.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Levetiracetam — an {{analogue}} of <b>piracetam</b> bearing {{an additional}} CH3-CH2- sidechain and bearing antiepileptic pharmacological properties through a poorly understood mechanism probably {{related to its}} affinity for the vesicle protein SV2A.|$|E
5000|$|Corneliu E. Giurgea (6 January 1923, Bucharest [...] - [...] 30 December 1995, Brussels) was a Romanian {{psychologist}} and chemist. In 1964 he synthetised <b>Piracetam,</b> {{which he has}} described as a nootropic.|$|E
50|$|Peripheral {{vascular}} {{effects of}} <b>piracetam</b> have suggested its use potential for vertigo, dyslexia and sickle cell anemia. A subsequent Cochrane {{review of the}} evidence did not support piracetam's use in sickle cell crisis prevention.|$|E
50|$|Racetams are a {{class of}} drugs that share a {{pyrrolidone}} nucleus. Some, such as <b>piracetam,</b> are considered nootropics. Some such as oxiracetam and phenylpiracetam are also stimulants. Others such as levetiracetam and seletracetam are anticonvulsants.|$|E
50|$|As of 2017 {{there had}} been many studies {{conducted}} in cells and in animal models, and {{there had been}} one clinical trial with 41 subjects, which compared Noopept and <b>piracetam</b> in people with traumatic brain injury.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of psychorganic {{syndrome}} {{is directed at}} the main disease. Nootropics like <b>piracetam,</b> have had positive effects on patients. Vitamin therapy, antioxidants, neurotropic, and cerebroprotective have also found to be effective when put on a repeat course.|$|E
50|$|It is {{produced}} industrially by treating butyrolactone with ammonia. Alternative routes include the partial hydrogenation of succinimide and the carbonylation of allylamine with methyl amine. 2-Pyrrolidone is an intermediate {{in the production}} of vinylpyrrolidone and the drug <b>piracetam.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Brivaracetam — an {{analogue}} of <b>piracetam</b> {{with the}} same additional side chain as levetiracetam and a three-carbon chain. It exhibits greater antiepileptic properties than levetiracetam in animal models, but with a somewhat smaller, although still high, therapeutic range.|$|E
50|$|Sunifiram (DM-235) is a {{piperazine}} derived research chemical {{which has}} anti-amnesiac effects in animal studies with significantly higher potency than <b>piracetam.</b> Sunifiram is a molecular simplification of unifiram. Based on in vitro and animal studies, {{it appears that}} sunifiram acts via AMPA-receptor activation.|$|E
50|$|In Wistar rats with {{gravitational}} cerebral ischemia, Phenylpiracetam {{reduced the}} extent of neuralgic deficiency manifestations, retained the locomotor, research, and memory functions, increased the survival rate, and lead to the favoring of local cerebral flow restoration upon the occlusion of carotid arteries {{to a greater extent}} than did <b>piracetam.</b>|$|E
