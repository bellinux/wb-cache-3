Gardeners and horticulturists have identified various hemipterans {{during the growing}} season affecting their cash crop such as aphids, including the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), English grain aphid (Macrosiphum avenae), and green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), spruce gall adelgid (Adelges cooleyi), <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> scale (Chionaspis pinifoliae), tomato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli), greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum), aster leafhopper (Macrosteles quadrilineatus) alfalfa plant bug (Adelphocoris lineolatus), tarnished plant bug (Lygus lineolaris), and black grass bug (Labops hesperius). Freshwater invertebrates of Saskatchewan typically consist of clams (Pelycypoda) (Mollusca Bivalvia), mollusca (Gastropoda and Pelecypoda), leech (Hirudinea), freshwater earthworm Oligochaeta, virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis), Scud (Amphipoda), fairy shrimp (Anostraca), Copepod, water flea (Cladocera), clam shrimp (Conchostraca), water mite (Hydrachnida) caddisfly (Trichoptera), damselfly (Zygoptera), mayfly (Ephemeroptera), alderfly (Megaloptera), seed shrimp (Ostracod), and tadpole shrimp (Notostraca).|$|E

It may be distinguished from M.haematopus in several ways: it is smaller, with cap diameters between [...] wide; grows in groups rather than clusters; is found on leaves, dead branches, moss beds and <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> beds rather than decaying wood; and the edges of its gills are consistently dark brownish-red. Furthermore, range of cap color in M.sanguinolenta is different than in M.haematopus, varying from reddish-to orange-brown, and it lacks a band of partial veil remnants hanging from the margin.|$|E
50|$|In {{the absence}} of cones, limber pine can also be hard to tell from Western white pine (P. monticola) where they occur {{together}} in the northern Rockies and the Sierra Nevada east slope.

Limber <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> are also usually shorter, 4 - 7 cm long, while western white <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> are 5 - 10 cm, though the ranges overlap.|$|R

2500|$|Many pine species make {{attractive}} ornamental plantings for {{parks and}} larger gardens {{with a variety}} of dwarf cultivars being suitable for smaller spaces. Pines are also commercially grown and harvested for Christmas trees. [...] Pine cones, the largest and most durable of all conifer cones, are craft favorites. [...] Pine boughs, [...] appreciated especially in wintertime for their pleasant smell and greenery, are popularly cut for decorations. A number of species are attacked by nematodes, causing pine wilt disease, which can kill some quickly.

40|$|Synthesis and {{characterization}} of <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> reinforced thermosetting resin (Resorcinol-Formaldehyde) {{which is most}} suitable as composite matrix has been reported. The polycondensation reaction between resorcinol and formaldehyde (RF) in different molar ratios {{has been applied to}} the synthesis of RF polymer matrix. A thermosetting resin based composite, containing approximately 10, 20, 30 and 40 % of natural fiber by weight, has been obtained by adding <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> to the Resorcinol-Formaldehyde (RF) resin. The mechanical properties of randomly oriented intimately mixed particle reinforced (<b>Pine</b> <b>needles)</b> composites were determined.

The reinforcing of the resin with <b>Pine</b> <b>needles</b> was accomplished in particle size of 200 micron by employing optimized resin.

60|$|Yet I {{experienced}} {{sometimes that}} the most sweet and tender, the most innocent and encouraging society {{may be found in}} any natural object, even for the poor misanthrope and most melancholy man. There can be no very black melancholy to him who lives in the midst of Nature and has his senses still. There was never yet such a storm but it was Æolian music to a healthy and innocent ear. Nothing can rightly compel a simple and brave man to a vulgar sadness. While I enjoy the friendship of the seasons I trust that nothing can make life a burden to me. The gentle rain which waters my beans and keeps me in the house today is not drear and melancholy, but good for me too. Though it prevents my hoeing them, it is of far more worth than my hoeing. If it should continue so long as to cause the seeds to rot in the ground and destroy the potatoes in the low lands, it would still be good for the grass on the uplands, and, being good for the grass, {{it would be good for}} me. Sometimes, when I compare myself with other men, it seems as if I were more favored by the gods than they, beyond any deserts that I am conscious of; as if I had a warrant and surety at their hands which my fellows have not, and were especially guided and guarded. I do not flatter myself, but if it be possible they flatter me. I have never felt lonesome, or in the least oppressed by a sense of solitude, but once, and that was a few weeks after I came to the woods, when, for an hour, I doubted if the near neighborhood of man was not essential to a serene and healthy life. To be alone was something unpleasant. But I was at the same time conscious of a slight insanity in my mood, and seemed to foresee my recovery. In the midst of a gentle rain while these thoughts prevailed, I was suddenly sensible of such sweet and beneficent society in Nature, in the very pattering of the drops, and in every sound and sight around my house, an infinite and unaccountable friendliness all at once like an atmosphere sustaining me, as made the fancied advantages of human neighborhood insignificant, and I have never thought of them since. Every little <b>pine</b> <b>needle</b> expanded and swelled with sympathy and befriended me. I was so distinctly made aware of the presence of something kindred to me, even in scenes which we are accustomed to call wild and dreary, and also that the nearest of blood to me and humanest was not a person nor a villager, that I thought no place could ever be strange to me again.|$|E

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{behind this}} project {{was to develop a}} better understanding of the role that the stove top plays in a stove where <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> are the main fuel source. <b>Pine</b> <b>needles</b> have distinct characteristics in their combustion cycle that make it challenging to effectively harness the energy released for cooking purposes. Processed <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> are currently used as a fuel source, but in areas where the process of turning raw <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> into another fuel form is not feasible, the use of unprocessed <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> as a fuel source is required. Two stove top configurations, a spiral and C-shape configuration, were designed and tested in a semi-gasifier system under forced convection. Measurements of operating temperature at various locations for each stove top design indicated that the C-shape design was best at distributing heat more evenly throughout the stove top, which is desirable when cooking, even though it consumed slightly more fuel than the spiral design. The findings of this report can be used as a benchmark prototype for larger-scale stove tops as well as for stoves that need to have passive airflow and non-automated feeding systems. by Alyssa J.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{frequency}} and timing of abortion and the serum levels of 17 β-estradiol and progesterone in Korean native cows fed <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> during pregnancy.

The control group was fed a concentrate and rice straw, and the other 2 groups were fed, in addition, either 1. 3 or 2. 7 kg (dry weight) of Korean <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> daily, starting at an average of 91 d of gestation and continuing until 245 d of gestation. The health status of the dams and the viability of the fetuses were ascertained by rectal palpation and ultrasound scanning during pregnancy. Simultaneously, blood samples were collected for analysis of serum 17 β-estradiol and progesterone. Two abortions in mid-pregnancy (at 126 and 150 d of gestation) occurred in the group ingesting the higher daily amount of <b>pine</b> <b>needles.</b> Premature parturition occurred at 259 d of gestation in this group and at 241 and 252 d of gestation in the group ingesting the lower daily amount of <b>pine</b> <b>needles.</b> The serum 17 β-estradiol concentration was significantly higher (P < 0. 05) at 4 mo of gestation and the serum progesterone level significantly lower (P < 0. 05) at 8 mo of gestation in the group ingesting more <b>pine</b> <b>needles</b> daily than in either of the other 2 groups.
