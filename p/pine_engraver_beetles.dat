40|$|Abstract Bark beetles use monoterpenoid {{aggregation}} pheromones {{to coordinate}} host colonization and mating. These chemical signals are produced de novo in midgut cells via the mevalonate pathway, and pheromone produc-tion may be regulated by a negative feedback system mediated through the antennae. In this study, we explored {{the effect of}} antennectomy on pheromone production and transcript levels of key mevalonate pathway genes in juvenile hormone III-treated male <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> <b>beetles,</b> Ips pini (Say). Antennectomized males produced signifi-cantly greater amounts of pheromone than podectomized males and those with intact antennae. Likewise, mRNA levels of three mevalonate pathway genes important in pheromone biosynthesis were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and found to be induced {{to a greater extent}} with antennectomy, suggesting a transcriptional regulation of pheromone production...|$|E
40|$|The {{abundance}} {{of the southern}} <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> <b>beetles,</b> Ips avulsus (Eichhoff), I. grandicollis (Eichhoff), and I. calligraphus (Germar), was monitored with pheromone-baited traps in 2012 and 2013 in Arkansas and eastern Texas. Additionally, vehicle-based and comprehensive ground-based surveys were used to estimate and confirm the amount of dead and fading trees in each trapping site. <b>Pine</b> <b>engraver</b> <b>beetles</b> have historically been recognized as secondary invaders of healthy trees, but observations of pine mortality in Texas and Arkansas appeared to correspond with high population densities of Ips spp. Forest sites exhibiting subjectively high or low incidence of Ips-associated mortality in Arkansas and Texas were monitored using short trapping periods in the spring, summer, and fall of 2012 and the spring of 2013. Results of trapping indicated that Ips abundance steadily declined {{from the start of}} the study, and I. calligraphus abundance was considerably less than the other two species. Over the course of this study, a total of 127, 823 I. avulsus, 217, 636 I. grandicollis, and 26, 290 I. calligraphus were trapped. The most abundant predators trapped were: 7555 Cleridae (Thanasimus dubius F. and Enoclerus spp.), 9036 Temnochila virescens (F.), 7162 Histeridae (Platysoma spp. and Plegaderus spp.), and 42, 313 Lasconotus spp. For the sites used in this study, vehicle-based surveys did provide a good predictive model of actual stand mortality. The existence of a correlation between Ips abundance and surveys of tree mortality was investigated. A strong relationship was found between the {{abundance of}} Ips and the total number of standing dead and fading trees during the spring and summer of 2012; however, this relationship dissolved as Ips abundance declined over the course of the study. The number of fading trees alone did not provide a good indication of high Ips abundance...|$|E
40|$|Discerning {{linkages}} among trophic {{levels and}} untangling indirect interactions {{is essential to}} understanding structuring of communities and ecosystems. Indeed, indirect interactions among disparate taxa are often essential to the functional role of these species. The goal {{of this research was}} to test the hypothesis that the relationship between 2 dendrophagous taxa, the North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) and the pine engraver beetle (Ips hoppingi), is an asymmetric indirect interaction mediated by a common host. We proposed that damage by the porcupine predisposes the papershell pinyon pine (Pinus remota) to colonization by <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> <b>beetles.</b> We examined porcupine tree selection, pinyon pine physiology and physiognomy, and beetle-pine associations on a study area in the southwestern Edwards Plateau of Texas from June 1997 to August 1999. Although attacks by beetles were evident on both damaged and undamaged trees, successful colonization was greater on pines damaged by porcupines. Intensity of porcupine attack, indexed by number of feeding scars and area of bark removed, also was associated with subsequent colonization by beetles. Porcupines selected pinyon pines over more abundant species (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and were selective at the level of morphology, whereas <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> <b>beetles</b> were selective of tree morphology and physiology. Trees colonized by beetles had phloem with higher concentrations of fructose and glucose and lower percent composition of limonene, sabinene, and terpinolene than uncolonized trees. Our findings supported our hypothesis of an indirect interaction between these dendrophages. We rejected alternative explanations (e. g., that these dendrophages preferred similar trees or that beetles facilitated porcupine damage) for this relationship based on the biology of Ips and their selection of host trees. We propose that release of volatile terpenes as a result of porcupine feeding and reallocation of carbon resources as a response to stress explains the facilitation of beetle colonization in porcupine-damaged trees. Our findings parallel those observed in other systems involving indirect effects and fit within the framework of theories explaining host plant-herbivore interactions...|$|E

Of particular {{interest is the}} decline of red pines which is characterized by expanding areas of dead and chlorotic trees in plantations throughout the Great Lakes Region. Here we {{examine the impact of}} two bark beetle groups, namely red turpentine <b>beetles</b> and <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> bark <b>beetles,</b> on tree mortality and the subsequent gap formation over time in a plantation in Wisconsin. We construct spatial-temporal statistical models that quantify the relations among red turpentine <b>beetle</b> colonization, <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> bark <b>beetle</b> colonization, and mortality of red pine trees, while accounting for correlation across space and over time. For statistical inference, we adopt a Bayesian hierarchical model and devise Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for obtaining the posterior distributions of model parameters as well as posterior predictive distributions. Our data analysis results suggest that red turpentine beetle colonization is associated with higher likelihood of <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> bark <b>beetle</b> colonization and <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> bark <b>beetle</b> colonization is associated with higher likelihood of red pine tree mortality, whereas there is no direct association between red turpentine beetle colonization and red pine tree mortality. There is strong evidence that red turpentine beetle colonization does not kill a red pine tree directly, but rather predisposes the tree to subsequent colonization by <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> bark <b>beetles.</b> The evidence is also strong that <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> bark <b>beetles</b> are the ultimate mortality agents of red pine trees...|$|R
40|$|Mountain {{pine beetle}} reached {{epidemic}} levels in second-growth ponderosa pine stands on Bureau of Indian Affairs and private {{lands on the}} Crow Indian Reservation. Approximately 9, 106 trees containing 420, 266 merchantable board feet were killed from 1971 to 1973. This is about 24 percent of the merchantable ponderosa pine in stands surveyed. Stands are stagnated, and trees appear stressed which is probably predisposing them to beetle attack. An increase in size of area infested and number of trees killed is expected in 1974. Commercial thinning to remove infested trees and reduce basal area is recommended to alleviate the problem.

40|$|Mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosas Hopk., reached near {{epidemic}} {{levels in}} lodgepole pine {{stands in the}} Sulphur Creek-Black Butte area. Lodgepole pine are probably more susceptible due to the overstocked conditions of stands, and high incidence of girdling of the base of trees by porcupines.

40|$|Ipsdienol is an {{important}} pheromone component for <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> <b>beetle,</b> Ips pini. Ipsdienol is a ten carbon monoterpenoid secondary alcohol and ipsdienone is the corresponding ketone. We are characterizing the activity of recombinant IDOL DH produced in Sf 9 (insect) cells. The enzyme has a high stereospecificity: (-) ipsdienol {{was found to be}} a substrate while (+) -ipsdienol was neither a substrate nor inhibitor. Closely related monoterpenoids, such as nerol, geraniol, and citral, were neither substrates nor inhibitors. Smaller compounds, such as 2 -propanol, also failed to act as an inhibitor or substrate. This indicates the binding site of this enzyme is highly selective. Failure to act as an inhibitor most likely indicates these compounds bind weakly (-) -Ipsdienol, ipsdienone, ipsenol, and ipsenone are substrates. Interestingly, menthone, a cyclic analog of ipsdienol, was found to have substrate activity. Results from gel permeation chromatography shows the active conformation of IDOL DH is a tetramer. Together these results suggest IDOLDH has a highly specific substrate binding site, and is a key component in pheromone biosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|Conifer {{bark beetles}} are often {{associated}} with fungal complexes whose components have different ecological roles. Some associated species are nutritionally obligate fungi, serving as nourishment to the larvae, whereas others are pathogenic bluestain fungi known {{to be involved in}} the interaction with host defenses. In this study we characterized the local and systemic defense responses of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) against Ophiostoma brunneo-ciliatum Math. (a blue-stain pathogen) and Hyalorhinocladiella macrospora (Franke-Grosm.) Harr. (a nutritional fungus). These fungi are the principal associates of the <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> <b>beetle,</b> Ips acuminatus (Gyll.). Host responses were studied following inoculation with the fungi, singly and as a fungal complex, and by identifying and quantifying terpenoids, phenolic compounds and lignin. Although the length of the necrotic lesions differed between control (wound) and fungal treatments, only two compounds (pinosylvin monomethyl ether and (+) -α-pinene) were significantly affected by the presence of the fungi, indicating that Scots pine has a generic, rather than specific, induced response. The fact that both nutritional and blue-stain fungi triggered comparable induced defense responses suggests that even a non-pathogenic fungus may participate in exhausting host plant defenses, indirectly assisting in the beetle establishment process. Our findings contribute to the further development of current theory on the role of associated fungal complexes in bark beetle ecology...|$|R
40|$|The California five-spined ips, Ips paraconfusus Lanier, {{produces}} the myrcene-derived acyclic monoterpene alcohols ipsenol (2 -methyl- 6 -methylene- 7 -octen- 4 -ol) and ipsdienol (2 -methyl- 6 -methylene- 2, 7 -octadien- 4 -ol) as components of its aggregation pheromone. The <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> <b>beetle,</b> Ips pini (Say), produces only ipsdienol. Previous {{studies have shown}} that myrcene, a monoterpene in the pines colonized by these beetles, is a direct precursor to these pheromone components. In vivo radiolabeling studies reported here showed that male I. paraconfusus incorporated [1 - 14 C]acetate into ipsenol, ipsdienol, and amitinol (trans- 2 -methyl- 6 -methylene- 3, 7 -octadien- 2 -ol), while male I. pini incorporated [1 - 14 C]acetate into ipsdienol and amitinol. Females of these species produced neither labeled nor unlabeled pheromone components. The purified radiolabeled monoterpene alcohols from-males were identified by comparison of their HPLC and GC retention times with those of unlabeled standards. HPLC-purified fractions containing the individual radiolabeled components were analyzed by GC-MS and were shown to include only the pure alcohols. To further confirm that ipsdienol and ipsenol were radiolabeled, diastereomeric ester derivatives of the isolated alcohols were synthesized and analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS. After derivatization of the radiolabeled alcohols, the HPLC analysis demonstrated expected shifts in retention times with conservation of naturally occurring stereochemistry. The results provide direct evidence for de novo biosynthesis of ipsenol, ipsdienol, and amitinol by bark beetles...|$|R
40|$|Sphaeropsis sapinea (Fr. :Fr.) Dyko and Sutton, {{is among}} the most common and widely {{distributed}} pathogens of conifers worldwide. S. sapinea is disseminated over short distances by rain splash and moist wind, but significant knowledge gaps regarding long-range dispersal remain. Our objective was {{to determine whether or not}} the <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> <b>beetle,</b> Ips pini Say, is a vector of the pathogen onto Austrian pines (Pinus nigra Arnold). In 2004 and 2005, individuals of I. pini were collected with pheromone traps at two locations in central Ohio (197 and 1, 017 individuals for 2004 and 2005, respectively) and screened for the presence of S. sapinea. In the field, fresh logs of Austrian pine were baited with pheromone lures, mechanically wounded, or left undisturbed. After 2 mo, logs were evaluated for insect feeding and the presence of S. sapinea along beetle galleries. Fresh logs were also inoculated in the greenhouse with adult I. pini that were either artificially infested or uninfested with S. sapinea spores to determine vectoring potential. Phoresy rates for individual collections ranged from 0 to 4. 1 %; average rates were 1. 5 and 2. 0 % for 2004 and 2005, respectively. Isolation frequencies of S. sapinea from baited (15 ± 5 %) and unbaited logs (3 ± 1 %) differed significantly (P = 0. 009). I. pini was also capable of transmitting the pathogen under controlled conditions. Based on phoresy rates, association, and artificial inoculation studies, we conclude that I. pini is able to transmit S. sapinea to Austrian pine stems...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{ponderosa pine}} (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) {{mortality}} {{associated with a}} widespread severe drought and increased bark beetle (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) populations occurred in Arizona from 2001 to 2004. A complex of Ips beetles including: the Arizona fivespined ips, Ips lecontei Swaine, the <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> <b>beetle,</b> Ips pini(Say), Ips calligraphus (Germar), Ips latidens (LeConte), Ips knausi Swaine and Ips integer(Eichhoff) were the primary bark beetle species associated with ponderosa pine mortality. In this study we examine stand conditions and physiographic factors associated with bark beetle-caused tree mortality in ponderosa pine forests across five National Forests in Arizona. A total of 633 fixed-radius plots were established across five National Forests in Arizona: Apache-Sitgreaves, Coconino, Kaibab, Prescott, and Tonto. Prior to the bark beetle outbreak, plots with mortality had higher tree and stocking compared with plots without pine mortality. Logistic regression modeling found that probability of ponderosa pine mortality caused by bark beetles {{was positively correlated with}} tree density and inversely related with elevation and tree diameter. Given the large geographical extent of this study resulting logistic models to estimate the likelihood of bark beetle attack should have wide applicability across similar ponderosa pine forests across the Southwest. This is particularly true of a model driven by tree density and elevation constructed by combining all forests. Tree mortality resulted in significant reductions in basal area, tree density, stand density index, and mean tree diameter for ponderosa pine and for all species combined in these forests. Most of the observed pine mortality was in the 10 – 35 cm diameter class, which comprise much of the increase in tree density over the past century as a result of fire suppression and grazing practices. Ecological implications of tree mortality are discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pine</b> <b>engraver,</b> Ips pini (Say), {{often use}} {{thinning}} slash, and their populations {{are known to}} be influenced by the condition of this material. In our study, we evaluated the importance of three log diameters (5, 10, and 20 cm) and three lengths (60, 120, and 240 cm) on various parameters of bark beetle host attack, development, and emergence. Evaluation of slash colonization in northern Arizona (near Flagstaff) and western Montana (near Missoula) over several years, during both spring and summer reproductive periods, indicated that the size of material selected by <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> differed by state, year, and season. However, within individual trials and over all trials, a trend in preference for larger diameter logs was apparent, whereas log length was of little effect. When evaluating only attacked logs, results indicated that the apparent preference for larger logs was not followed by significantly greater reproductive performance in the larger log sizes. Log origin was tested as a potential factor for the difference in attack densities between Arizona and Montana trials. Although male beetles in Montana and female beetles in Arizona seemed to distinguish between local-source and foreign-source logs during the attack phase, the gallery development and reproductive success of egg, larval, and new adult stages were not significantly different. Ultimately, differences among the trials both in host size selection and in reproductive success within attacked logs were closely tied to the overall population density of adult beetles.

40|$|Four {{treatments}} (control, burn-only, thin-only, and thin-and-burn) {{were evaluated}} for {{their effects on}} bark beetle-caused mortality in both the short-term (one to four years) and the long-term (seven years) in mixed-conifer forests in western Montana, USA. In addition to assessing bark beetle responses to these treatments, we also measured natural enemy landing rates and resin flow of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) the season fire treatments were implemented. All bark beetles were present at low population levels (non-outbreak) {{for the duration of}} the study. Post-treatment mortality of trees due to bark beetles was lowest in the thin-only and control units and highest in the units receiving burns. Three tree-killing bark beetle species responded positively to fire treatments: Douglas-fir <b>beetle</b> (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae), <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> (Ips pini), and western pine beetle (Dendroctonus brevicomis). Red turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus valens) responded positively to fire treatments, but never caused mortality. Three fire damage variables tested (height of crown scorch, percent circumference of the tree bole scorched, or degree of ground char) were significant factors in predicting beetle attack on trees. Douglas-fir <b>beetle</b> and <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> responded rapidly to increased availability of resources (fire-damaged trees); however, successful attacks dropped rapidly once these resources were depleted. Movement to green trees by <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> was not observed in plots receiving fire treatments, or in thinned plots where slash supported substantial reproduction by this beetle. The fourth tree-killing beetle present at the site, the mountain pine beetle, did not exhibit responses to any treatment. Natural enemies generally arrived at trees the same time as host bark beetles. However, the landing rates of only one, Medetera spp., was affected by treatment. This predator responded positively to thinning treatments. This insect was present in very high numbers indicating a regulatory effect on beetles, at least in the short-term, in thinned stands. Resin flow decreased from June to August. However, resin flow was significantly higher in trees in August than in June in fire treatments. Increased flow in burned trees later in the season did not affect beetle attack success. Overall, responses by beetles to treatments were short-term and limited to fire-damaged trees. Expansions into green trees did not occur. This lack of spread was likely due to a combination of high tree vigor in residual stands and low background populations of bark beetles...|$|R

30|$|To {{effectively}} interpret treatment outcomes we {{must begin}} with {{the relationship between the}} two “treatment” components in 2016 : silvicultural fuel reduction and MPB-caused tree mortality. Studies have shown endemic (non-outbreak) beetle populations can cause additional mortality in response to burning treatments, killing injured or less vigorous trees that may have survived burning alone (e.g., Larsson et al. 1983, Negrón and Popp 2004, Fettig et al. 2010). On our sites, Six and Skov (2009) identified that, by 2008, three bark beetle species (Douglas-fir beetle [Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins], <b>pine</b> <b>engraver</b> [Ips pini Say], and western pine beetle [Dendroctonus brevicomis LeConte]) increased in abundance because of burning treatments. MPB population size did not respond to treatment, but successful MPB attacks were more prevalent in unthinned treatments. By 2012, the regional MPB outbreak had caused high overstory mortality in the control (50 %) and burn-only (39 %) treatment units, leading to similar live ponderosa pine basal areas across all treatments (Hood et al. 2016).|$|R

A., is the <b>pine</b> <b>engraver,</b> Ips pini (Say). Other herbivores include Ips grandicollis (Eichhoff) and Dryophthorus americanus Bedel (Curculionidae). The predomi-nant predators are the beetles Thanasimus dubius (Cleridae) and Platysoma cylindrica (Histeridae). 3 We conducted field assays using two enantiomeric ratios of ipsdienol, and frontalin plus a-pinene. Ipsdienol {{is the principal}} pheromone component of I. pini, and frontalin is produced by a number ofDendroctonus species. a-Pinene is a host monoterpene commonly incorporated into commercial frontalin lures. 4 Thanasimus dubius was attracted to frontalin plus a-pinene, and also to racemic ipsdienol. By contrast, I. pini was attracted to racemic ipsdienol, but showed n...|$|R
40|$|Selective logging, fire suppression, forest {{succession}} and climatic {{changes have}} resulted in high fire hazards over {{large areas of the}} western USA. Federal and state hazardous fuel reduction programs have increased accordingly to reduce the risk, extent and severity of these events, particularly in the wildland–urban interface. In this study, we examined the effects of mechanical fuel reduction treatments on the activity of bark beetles in ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa Dougl ex. Laws., forests located in Arizona and California, USA. Treatments were applied in both late spring (April–May) and late summer (August–September) and included: (1) thinned biomass chipped and randomly dispersed within each 0. 4 ha plot; (2) thinned biomass chipped, randomly dispersed within each plot and raked 2 m from the base of residual trees; (3) thinned biomass lopped- and-scattered (thinned trees cut into 1 – 2 m lengths) within each plot; (4) an untreated control. The mean percentage of residual trees attacked by bark beetles ranged from 2. 0 % (untreated control) to 30. 2 % (plots thinned in spring with all biomass chipped). A three-fold increase in the percentage of trees attacked by bark beetles was observed in chipped versus lopped-and-scattered plots. Bark beetle colonization of residual trees was higher during spring treatments, which corresponded with peak adult beetle flight periods as measured by funnel trap captures. Raking chips away from the base of residual trees did not significantly affect attack rates. Several bark beetle species were present including the roundheaded pine beetle, Dendroctonus adjunctus Blandford (AZ), western pine beetle, D. brevicomis LeConte (AZ and CA), mountain pine beetle, D. ponderosae Hopkins (CA), red turpentine beetle, D. valens LeConte (AZ and CA), Arizona fivespined ips, Ips lecontei Swaine (AZ), California fivespined ips, I. paraconfusus Lanier (CA) and <b>pine</b> <b>engraver,</b> I. pini (Say) (AZ). Dendroctonus valens was the most common bark beetle infesting residual trees. A significant correlation was found between the number of trees chipped per plot and the percentage of residual trees with D. valens attacks. A significantly higher percentage of residual trees was attacked by D. brevicomis in plots that were chipped in spring compared to the untreated control. In lopped-and-scattered treatments, <b>engraver</b> <b>beetles</b> produced substantial broods in logging debris, but few attacks were observed on standing trees. At present, no significant difference in tree mortality exists among treatments. A few trees appeared to have died solely from D. valens attacks, as no other scolytids were observed in the upper bole. In a laboratory study conducted to provide an explanation for the bark beetle responses observed in this study, monoterpene elution rates from chip piles declined sharply over time, but were relatively constant in lopped-and-piled treatments. The quantities of b-pinene, 3 -carene, a-pinene and myrcene eluting from chips exceeded those from lopped-and- piled slash during each of 15 sample periods. These laboratory results may, in part, explain the bark beetle response observed in chipping treatments. The implications of these results to sustainable forest management are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Permanent plots were {{established}} in the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) following the 1988 fires to determine response of bark beetles to fire-injured conifers. Within 2 years (1989 and 1990), 67 percent of the Douglas-fir had been infested by bark beetles (primarily the Douglas-fir beetle) and wood borers; 44 percent of the lodgepole pine were infested (primarily by the <b>pine</b> <b>engraver)</b> 2 ̆ 7 82 percent of the Engelmann spruce were infested (mostly by spruce beetle) 2 ̆ 7 and 71 percent of the subalpine fir were infested (mostly by wood borers). Bark beetle infestation usually occurred in trees having 50 percent of more basal girdling by fire. However, uninjured Douglas-fir also had 46 percent of the trees infested in 1990. The large proportion of uninjured Douglas-fir that was infested by Douglas-fir beetle in 1990 suggests infestation will increase in unburned portions of the GYA. Of the trees that died, a fire-injury model correctly predicted death for one-half of the Douglas-fir and two-thirds of the lodgepole pine, {{but all of the}} Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir...|$|R
