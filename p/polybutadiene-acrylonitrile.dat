40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{summarized}} for systematic quench-burning tests on ammonium perchlorate-HC binder sandwiches with binder thicknesses {{in the range}} 10 - 150 microns. Tests included three binders (polysulfide, <b>polybutadiene-acrylonitrile,</b> and hydroxy terminated polybutadiene), and pressures from 1. 4 to 14 MPa. In addition, deflagration limits were determined in terms of binder thickness and pressure. Results are {{discussed in terms of}} a qualitative theory of sandwich burning consolidated from various sources. Some aspects of the observed results are explained only speculatively...|$|E
