Problems of definition and methodology are discussed, and the work of GESAMP working groups on, among others, Marine Waste Disposal, Coastal Water Quality Criteria and the Impact of Oil on the Marine Environment are reported. The author concludes that marine pollution control at the international level {{has not been able to}} make much <b>practical</b> <b>headway</b> because political expectations have outstripped scientific and administrative possibilities.

40|$|Attempts to {{determine}} the energy spectrum (or spectral energy distribution) for all values of its wave number argument are a fundamental objective of turbulence theory. Detailed predictions of the energy spectrum are not yet possible {{for more than a}} very few classes of idealized flows. Nevertheless, to make <b>practical</b> <b>headway,</b> it is necessary to evolve a heuristic physical picture of turbulent flow. Of particular interest in partic 1 e-fluid interaction is the comparison of scale lengths in each region of the spectrum. When partic 1 e inertia can be neglected, the diffusion, energy-containing, and inertial subranges of the spectrum are of most interest. While the Kolmogorov theory on the energy cascade is useful for describing the energy processes in an idealized turbulent flow, its applicability to the prediction of turbulence is restricted to isotropic or homogeneous flows (or the isotropic portion of turbulent flows, namely the smaller-scale characteristics of the flow). Most practical flows of interest involve at least violation of isotropy through the introduction of shear and, in most situations, non-homogeneities as a result of shear flow variation. Turbulent energy spectra for such flows are significantly more complicated and must inc 1 ude the features representative of the coherent structures. We have performed LDA measurements in various locations of the flow field in two static mixers (of diameters 20 mm and 54 mm) of HEV type (High Efficiency Vortex) : the same geometry is {{at the base of the}} two mixers obtained by a simple homothety. The flow in this geometry is highly non uniform, and the turbulence is produced by small fins fixed at the walls of an empty duct, so that the longitudinal vortices and the wake effects predominate over the wall turbulence. The work consists to study the shape modification of the turbulent spectra in the size extrapolation and to test the traditional extrapolation laws, while comparing, in the two mixers, spectra and scales of turbulence at constant velocity or constant Reynolds number...|$|E
30|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, {{significant}} researches have been conducted while suggesting alternative distribution functions compatible to mixed traffic. The log-logistic and lognormal distributions were observed to describe headway data well at flow levels that corresponds to peak hourâ€™s traffic than off-peak hours, indicating a better approximation of congested traffic [6, 7]. By the same token, Pearson 5 and Pearson 6 distributions also exhibit their aptness at heavy flow and they provide a fairly decent fit under such flow while describing the headways [8]. After almost a century, this search is not yet over. In fact, transportation researchers are still working on reliable and <b>practical</b> descriptions of <b>headways</b> particularly if the prevalent traffic is extremely heterogeneous in character and composed {{of a wide variety}} of vehicles including the non-motorized ones.|$|R
30|$|Over {{the past}} few years, road traffic has tremendously {{increased}} across the globe {{and as a result}} of it traffic congestion has been a critical issue in many countries worldwide. At times, traffic analysts face difficulties in characterizing and modeling such congested flow of traffic, thereby, addressing this issue effectively. Since a key component of determining the performance of a simulation model is the generation of inter-arrival times or headways as an input into the simulation process, it is imperative to have reliable and <b>practical</b> descriptions of <b>headways.</b> At congested state of flow, the conventional approach is, however, found ineffective due to large proportion of shorter headways. Further, modelling of time headways under mixed traffic is still vague even after decades because of inherent complexities of analysing such traffic and no significant efforts have been made so far in regard to this. This was the motives for taking up a systematic investigation of some intriguing characteristics of time headway distributions under such traffic particularly at moderate and heavy flow.|$|R
40|$|Problem: The Adaptive Cruise Control is an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) {{that allows}} {{maintaining}} given headway and speed, according to settings pre-defined by the users. Despite {{the potential benefits}} associated to the utilization of ACC, previous studies warned against negative behavioral adaptations that might occur while driving with the system activated. Unfortunately, up to now, there are no unanimous results about the effects induced by the usage of ACC on speed and time headway to the vehicle in front. Also, few studies were performed including actual users of ACC among the subjects. Objectives: This research aimed to investigate {{the effect of the}} experience gained with ACC on speed and time headway for a group of users of the system. In addition, it explored the impact of ACC usage on speed and time headway for ACC users and regular drivers. Method: A matched sample driving simulator study was planned as a two-way (2 x 2) repeated measures mixed design, with the experience with ACC as between-subjects factor and the driving condition (with ACC and manually) as within-subjects factor. Results: The results show that the usage of ACC brought a small but not significant reduction of speed and, especially, the maintenance of safer time headways, being the latter result greater for ACC users, probably as a consequence of their experience in using the system. Summary: The usage of ACC did not cause any negative behavioral adaptations to the system regarding speed and time <b>headway.</b> <b>Practical</b> applications: Based on this research work, the Adaptive Cruise Control showed the potential to improve road safety for what concerns the speed and the time headway maintained by the drivers. The speed of the surrounding traffic and the minimum time headway settable through the ACC seem to have an important effect on the road safety improvement achievable with the system.
