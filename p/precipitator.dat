25|$|An {{electrostatic}} <b>precipitator</b> (ESP), or electrostatic {{air cleaner}} is a particulate collection device that removes particles from a flowing gas (such as air) using {{the force of}} an induced electrostatic charge. Electrostatic precipitators are highly efficient filtration devices that minimally impede the flow of gases through the device, and can easily remove fine particulate matter such as dust and smoke from the air stream. In 1907, the California physicist Frederick G. Cottrell invented and received a patent for the electrostatic <b>precipitator.</b>|$|E
25|$|Electrostatic {{induction}} is {{also used}} for electro-mechanic precipitation or projection.In such technologies, charged particles of small sizes are collected or deposited intentionally on surfaces. Applications range from Electrostatic <b>precipitator</b> to Spray painting or Inkjet printing.|$|E

There are many aspects of pollution control in both solid and liquid phase using electrostatic <b>precipitators.</b> The operation of plate-type electrostatic <b>precipitators</b> {{is closely related to}} its electrical energization, to obtain high collection efficiency with low electrical energization consumption.

25|$|In {{this article}} {{constant}} pressure blackout and shallow water blackout refers to blackouts {{in shallow water}} following hyperventilation and ascent blackout and deep water blackout refers to blackout on ascent from depth. Some free divers consider blackout on ascent to be a special condition or subset of shallow water blackout but the primary underlying mechanisms differ. This confusion is exacerbated {{by the fact that}} in the case of blackout on ascent, hyperventilation induced hypocapnia also may be a contributory factor even if depressurisation on ascent is the actual <b>precipitator.</b>|$|E
