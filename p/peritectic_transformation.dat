An assessment of the behavior of the concentration gradient in the γ-phase (the peritectic phase) through time was also carried out and a mathematical function which describes the γ-phase thickness evolution was defined. Finally, 2 -D simulations were performed to clearly identify the two stages of the peritectic phase transformation.

40|$|It is well {{documented}} that ultrasonic melt treatment (USMT) can refine dendritic and eutectic microstructures during solidification, but much less {{attention has been paid}} to the effect of USMT on macro-segregation and intermetallic transformations. In this research, macro-segregation and primary Fe-containing intermetallic <b>peritectic</b> <b>transformations</b> in an Al- 19 wt pct Si- 4 wt pct Fe alloy were investigated without and with USMT. Macrostructural examination showed that in the absence of USMT the ingot revealed considerable non-uniform distribution of both the primary Fe-containing intermetallic and primary Si particles, whereas the ingot with USMT exhibited near homogeneous distribution of both primary phases, i. e., reduced macro-segregation. The beneficial effect of USMT on relieving macro-segregation was further examined using quantitative microstructural metallography and the results indicated that the area fraction, number density, and size distribution of both primary phases became essentially uniform across the ingot after USMT. USMT further exerted a significant impact on the constitution of the primary Fe-containing intermetallics, where complex particles of delta-Al 3 FeSi 2 /beta-Al 5 FeSi were prominent without USMT, while few delta-Al 3 FeSi 2 particles were observed after USMT and the primary Fe-containing intermetallics existed mostly as the single-phase beta-Al 5 FeSi. The underlying reason was attributed to the reduction in the size of the primary delta-Al 3 FeSi 2 particles which ensures the complete transformation of most primary delta-Al 3 FeSi 2 particles to the peritectic beta-Al 5 FeSi phase.

40|$|In this study, two semi-analytical {{models of}} {{microsegregation}} {{were developed to}} predict the concentration fields of solute in the liquid and solid regions for dendritic solidification of binary metallic alloys. Both models assume that the growing dendrites are cylindrical in shape. This assumption is more realistic compared to the common assumptions of plate-like dendrites {{that most of the}} earlier researchers employed in their microsegregation modeling study. The solute redistribution profile, in the developing solid layer, necessary to determine the back diffusion parameter was derived from Fick's second law for the model without coarsening. The application of this parameter {{in a wide range of}} conditions and the use of its basic form in the model with coarsening was verified. The concept of coordinate transformation and enhancement of back-diffusion Fourier number were used in deriving the model which took into account the coarsening of dendrites. The models are then extended to deal with rapid solidification, <b>peritectic</b> <b>transformations</b> and multi-component systems and the results were compared with relevant experimental data. A good agreement between the model predictions and experimental results was found. The second part of this study was focused on developing a fully numerical microsegregation model. The numerical model built upon a previously proposed phase change model which relied upon a coordinate transformation technique. The model was extended to deal with moving boundaries with solute diffusion. A suitable computational procedure was developed to solve the model equations which are strongly coupled to each other. To verify the accuracy of the present algorithm with regard to the capability of tracking the moving interfaces, analytical solution of the Stefan problem was used for verification purposes. A good agreement between the model predictions and the analytical solution was found.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common defects leading to the {{rejection}} of faulty castings made of duplex cast steel is hot cracking. Hot cracking –differently from cold cracking which occur on cooling, when the material exhibits already distinct elastic properties – proceeds in the semi-solid state, particularly when the temperature of solidifying casting is close to the equilibrium solidus point. There exist a range of temperatures {{in the vicinity of the}} solidus point within which the solidifying metal shows very small deformation ability and small strength. Therefore even little stresses occurring at the solidification stage and caused by density difference between ferrite and austenite,or restricted shrinkage, or various temperature gradients, can be the reason of hot cracking. Copper addition, as it is used in cast steel grades implemented in Polish power industry applications, decreases the temperature of the end of solidification, thus affecting beneficially the surface reproduction quality, but on the other hand it can promote, along with several other elements contained in duplex cast steel, the <b>peritectic</b> <b>transformation</b> during the last stage of solidification.

40|$|A {{model for}} {{isothermal}} coarsening of secondary dendrite arms in <b>peritectic</b> reaction and <b>transformation</b> (liquid + primary-phase → peritectic-phase) is proposed {{to evaluate the}} secondary dendrite arm spacing (λ 2) of the primary phase in directional solidification of peritectic alloys. The model defines three stages for thin-arm dissolution (or thick-arm coarsening), i. e. the initial, intermediate and final stages: The initial thin-arm dissolution through the primary phase is sustained solely by the Gibbs-Thomson effect; the intermediate thin-arm dissolution through the peritectic phase is driven by Gibbs-Thomson effect but retarded by the peritectic reaction and transformation; the final dissolution through the primary and peritectic phases is enhanced by the Gibbs-Thomson effect and the phase transformation. The kinetics of <b>peritectic</b> reaction and <b>transformation</b> {{were found to be}} crucial to determine the thin-arm dissolution, which were characterized by the reaction constant (f) and the diffusion coefficient of solute in solid peritectic-phase (D S), respectively. The present model shows that λ 2 V m is constant for a given Pb-Bi peritectic alloy, where V is growth velocity, and the factor, m, ranges from 1 / 3 to 1 / 2, rather than that normally observed (e. g. 1 / 3) for single-phase solidification.

The calculations of solute microsegregation ratio (C_L/C_ 0) in the interdendritic region are related to solidification paths. The microsegregation ratios of P and S increase as the initial C concentration increases, while they reduce with increasing initial C contents for solutes C and Si.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} <b>peritectic</b> {{reactions}} and <b>transformations</b> that occur during the solidification of many alloys. Peritectics {{are believed to}} be a major cause of crack-formation in many steels, thus, good knowledge of the mechanisms by which these phenomena occur is essential for preventing such defects. The thesis also handles the behaviour of metals, in particular cast structures, during hot forming. Grain size and microstructure are of most importance in determining the strength, toughness and performance of a steel. For achieving enhanced mechanical and microstructural properties, good understanding of the phenomena occurring during hot forming is required. <b>Peritectic</b> reactions and <b>transformations</b> were studied in Fe-base and steel alloys through differential thermal analysis (DTA) experiments and micrographic investigation of quenched DTA samples. The effect of the ferrite/austenite interface strain during the peritectic reaction on equilibrium conditions was thermodynamically analysed, and the results were related to temperature observations from DTA experiments conducted on Fe-base alloys and low-alloy steels. Massive transformations from ferrite to austenite were observed in the micrographs of a number of quenched low-alloy steel samples and it was proposed that these transformations are uncontrolled by diffusion, and occur in the solid state as a visco-plastic stress relief process. DTA study of an austenitic stainless steel indicated that the alloy can exhibit primary precipitations to either ferrite or austenite. A continuously-cast breakout shell of the steel was analyzed and it was suggested that the observed irregularities in growth were due to alternating precipitations of ferrite and austenite; parts of the shell with higher ratios of primary-precipitated ferrite shrink in volume at the peritectic temperature and experience reduced growths. An experimental method for studying the behaviour of metals during hot forming developed, and hot compression tests were conducted on cast copper and ball-bearing steel samples. Flow stress curves were obtained at varying temperatures and strain rates, and the results showed good agreement with earlier observations reported in literature. Micrographic analysis of quenched samples revealed variations in grain size and a model was fitted to describe the grain size as a function of deformation temperature and strain. Solidification growth during continuous casting of stainless steel and copper was numerically modelled. A varying heat transfer coefficient was proposed to approximate the experimentally measured growth irregularities in the continuously-cast stainless steel breakout shell. Solidification growth of pure copper was also modelled in the Southwire continuous casting process.

40|$|DoktorgradsavhandlingThermoelectric Generators (TEG) are a {{potential}} technology for waste heat recovery. At their hearts, thermoelectric materials convert a heat flux into electric current. By placing TEGs {{on the surface}} of a waste heat source, some of the heat can be converted into valuable electric energy. However, todays state-of-the art materials have low efficiencies, are limited to low temperature operation, contains toxic and rare elements and are in general not cost-effective for such applications. New thermoelectric materials are needed that can overcome these barriers. In this thesis, two classes of materials have been investigated; skutterudites and silicides. Both have relatively high efficiencies, can be used at high temperatures (400 - 500 °C) and contain cheaper and less toxic compounds than state-of-the-art materials. To move these materials from lab-scale testing into real-life applications, the focus is shifted from optimizing for thermoelectric efficiency to long-term stability. As these materials will be used at higher temperatures, different temperature activated processes leading to degradation of the materials needs to be accounted for and controlled, such as oxidation and interdiffusion. Adoption into industrial mass production requires simple and cheap synthesis methods that produces homogenous materials. Homogenous materials are very important for achieving stable thermoelectric and mechanical properties over time. Secondary phases can easily form during synthesis of skutterudites, and knowledge about the formation and annihilation of such phases during synthesis was therefore studied thoroughly as these can have unbeneficial effect on both thermoelectric properties and thermal durability. Understanding the mechanisms and kinetics governing skutterudite formation is of great importance for optimizing synthesis parameters leading to faster and more homogenous production of skutterudites. P-type skutterudites with composition Fi 0. 6 Co 2 Fe 2 Sb 12 (Fi = In, Ca, Ce and Yb) were synthesized to look at the effect of filler element and microstructure. Ce-filled sample was furthermore synthesized using four different methods to assess the effect of synthesis method on secondary phase formation and thermoelectric properties. A precursor method was found to not only be the fastest method, but also produce the most homogenous material with highest zT of 0. 7. An important contribution of this thesis is the results and discussion around <b>peritectic</b> formation and <b>transformation</b> in the skutterudite system. In addition to grain size, the diffusivity of the filler element in skutterudite was found to be the main factor governing transformation time into phase pure skutterudite. High temperature oxidation of skutterudites as a function of filler atoms and iron content were furthermore investigated. Residual secondary phases resulting from incomplete transformation into the phase pure skutterudite, such as FeSb 2 and CeSb 2, were found to have severe effects on the oxidation rate. High iron content was also found to lower the onset temperature of oxidation in accordance with previous studies. In addition, the effect of In as a filler element was found to form an intermediate InSb layer that actually caused a reduction in oxidation rate. Also the high temperature oxidation of Mg 2 (Si-Sn) was studied {{as a function of the}} Sn content. All these materials formed a passivating outer layer of MgO. Above a certain ignition temperature, the MgO layer broke down and the oxidation proceeded exponentially. An increasing Sn content was found to significantly lower the ignition temperature due to formation of liquid Sn below the MgO layer. Similarly, the Pilling-Bedworth ratio (ratio of volume of oxide to volume of underlying alloy) was found to affect the ignition temperature. In both these oxidation studies, the common theme is that variations in elemental composition affect the resistance towards oxidation significantly. Clearly, these materials need to be optimized not only in terms of thermoelectric performance, but also stability towards oxidation. First of all, oxidizing resistant materials can be employed in application without the need of protective environments such as coatings or encapsulations. Secondly, control of the oxidation mechanisms is import in a mass production process both to ease the production process and to avoid accumulation of oxides in the final material. An alternative to oxidation resistant materials is the application of coatings on the outer surfaces. Several commercially available coatings were tested on both skutterudite and silicide. An aluminum-based coating was found most promising and could protect both material classes from oxidation during thermal cycling up to temperatures of 500 - 550 °C. It is believed that further optimization of this type of coating has a good future for use in protection of thermoelectric materials at high temperatures. To assess how different thermally activated degradation process affect the performance of thermoelectric materials and modules, long term testing of both single functionalized legs and prototype modules were conducted. A new test method was developed, where several single legs were electrically characterized separately throughout thermal cycling. This made it possible to compare different types of coatings with uncoated material, thereby identify the effect of the degradation processes upon performance. Both diffusion of metal contact into thermoelectric leg, oxidation in from sides, and crack formation, were found to significantly affect the performance of the legs over time, by reducing open circuit voltage and increasing inner resistance. Finally, several silicide based modules were assembled and tested. The n-type and p-type material was Mg 2 (Si-Sn) and MnSi 1. 75 respectively. The highest power of 3 W was measured for one of these modules at hot side temperatures of 700 °C and an estimated efficiency of 5. 3 % – the highest efficiency recorded to date for modules made purely of silicides. However, long term testing of one of these modules revealed gradual reduction in performance. Post-characterization showed how particularly oxidation and interdiffusion between thermoelectric leg and metal contact played a major role in the decline in power output...|$|R

It accounts for fast diffusion of interstitial elements, such as carbon, and low diffusion of substitutional {{elements in the}} solid phases, while complete mixing is assumed for all elements in the liquid phase. These considerations are turned into classical mathematical expressions for the chemical potentials and the u‑fractions, to which mass conservation equations are added. The {{combination of the two}} models permits application to steels, dealing with partial‑equilibrium for solidification and para‑equilibrium for both the δ‑BCC to γ‑FCC <b>peritectic</b> <b>transformation</b> and the γ‑FCC to α‑BCC solid state transformation. The numerical scheme makes use of calls to Thermo‑Calc and the TQ‑interface for calculating thermodynamic equilibrium and accessing data from the TCFE 6 database. Applications are given for a commercial steel. The results are discussed based on comparison with classical microsegregation models and experimental data...|$|E

The samples were prepared via arc melting and characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The intermetallics phases beta Ta 3 Ge, alpha Ta 3 Ge, beta Ta 5 Ge 3 and TaGe 2 where confirmed in this system. Three eutectics reactions where determined with the liquid compositions at 20. 5; 28. 0; 97. 0 at. % Ge. The phases beta Ta 3 Ge and beta Ta 5 Ge 3 solidifies congruently while TaGe 2 is formed through a <b>peritectic</b> <b>transformation.</b> The {{temperature of the}} Ta-rich eutectic (L Ta-ss + beta Ta 3 Ge) {{was measured by the}} Pirani-Alterthum method at 2440 degrees C and the Ge-rich eutectic (L TaGe 2 + Ge-ss) by DTA at 937 degrees C...|$|E
40|$|Reported work {{focuses on}} the effect of {{morphology}} of the Fe-rich intermetallic phases on the machinability of Al-alloy containing > 2 wt. % Fe, obtained from automotive scrap. Effect of Mo addition on the microstructure, high-temperature impression creep and thereby the machinability of the Al-recycled alloy were studied. The machinability of the recycled alloy was estimated by investigating the built-up-edge (BUE) and surface roughness (Ra). SEM-EDS and TEM-SADP {{studies have shown that the}} crystal structure (BCC) of the Al 8 Fe 2 Si phase remained unchanged; however, Mo replaced few Fe atoms with little effect on the lattice dimension. It has been found that the addition of Mo to the recycled alloy suppresses the formation of β-phase (Al 5 FeSi) by suppressing the <b>peritectic</b> <b>transformation</b> of α (Al 8 Fe 2 Si) phase. Such suppression is found to improve the high-temperature creep resistance and the machinability with the increase in the Mo addition level...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the flux-pinning behavior of sintered and melt-textured YBa{sub 2 }Cu{sub 3 }O{sub 7 -x} {{has been carried out}} by means of microstructural investigations (optical microscopy, SEM, TEM, EDS, DTA, and XRD) and magnetization measurements. It was found that both microstructure and magnetization behavior strongly depend on the starting material, the production method, and the maximum processing temperature. In our experiments, the critical current density, J{sub c}, increased with increasing processing temperature between 920 {degrees}C and 1050 {degrees}C (25 - 130 emu/cm{sup 3 }), but those samples processed at temperatures just above the <b>peritectic</b> <b>transformation</b> point (1020 OC and 1030 OC) exhibited a decreased J{sub c}. The carbon content of the starting powder and the powder`s melting behavior seem {{to play an important role}} in the development of microstructure and flux-pinning behavior during melt-texturing. A comparison of our data with previously published results shows that an optimized melt-texturing process can result in materials with critical current densities comparable to those of samples produced by Quench-Melt Growth...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntermetallic Ti– 46 Al– 5 Nb alloys were directionally {{solidified}} at constant growth rates (V) ranging from 10 to 200 μm/s under the temperature gradient of G= 3. 8 × 103 K/m. Quenching was {{performed at the}} end of directional solidification (DS) experiments. Macrostructures and microstructures in the longitudinal section as well as the cross section have been investigated. Fully lamellar microstructures were observed in the above range of growth rates. At the growth rates of 10 μm/s the primary phase was α while it changed to β when the growth rate was up to 20 μm/s. Both the primary dendritic arm spacing (λ) and the interlamellar spacing (λs) decreased with increasing growth rate according to the relationships and, respectively. Width of columnar grain decreased with increasing growth rate, and was uneven mainly because of the <b>peritectic</b> <b>transformation</b> in interdendritic and dendritic regions. Statistical result of the volume fraction of the lamellar microstructures in different orientations shows that, the one angled 0 - 30 °C to the growth direction has the largest volume fraction...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{extend the}} multi-phase-field concept, {{recently}} developed to model pure systems involving grains, to multi-phase alloy systems. We derive a phase-field model {{in a general}} form which has the flexibility to model a variety of binary alloys. In particular, our new model provides a framework for describing and numerically simulating the solidification of both eutectic and peritectic systems. We report computations that exhibit {{a wide range of}} realistic phenomena, including eutectic lamellae spacing selection by the annihilation of lamellae through competitive over-growth by their neighbours as well as tip splitting of individual lamellae. Our results are consistent with the scaling predictions of the classical Jackson and Hunt theory of eutectic lamellae. With regards to peritectic growth, we report simulations that exhibit many characteristic features of the peritectic phase transition: below the peritectic temperature the peritectic phase grows preferentially along the properitectic phase by solute diffusion in the liquid until the parent phase is engulfed. The subsequent <b>peritectic</b> <b>transformation</b> continues by solid diffusion on a longer timescale...|$|E
