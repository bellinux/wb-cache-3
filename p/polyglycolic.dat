25|$|In the past, spherical nonporous {{implants}} {{were placed}} in the intraconal space and the extraocular muscles were either left unattached or were tied over the implant. Wrapping these implants allows attachment of the muscles to the covering material, a technique that seems to improve implant movement and reduce the incidence of implant migration. Porous implants may be saturated with antibiotic solution before insertion. Because the brittle nature of hydroxyapatite prevents direct suturing of the muscles to the implant, these implants are usually covered with some form of wrapping material. The muscles are attached to the implant in a technique similar to that used for spherical non-porous implants. The muscles may be directly sutured to porous polyethylene implants either by passing the suture through the implant material or by using an implant with fabricated suture tunnels. Some surgeons also wrap porous polyethylene implants either to facilitate muscle attachment or {{to reduce the risk of}} implant exposure. A variety of wrapping materials have been used to cover porous implants, including polyglactin or <b>polyglycolic</b> acid mesh, heterologous tissue (bovine pericardium), homologous donor tissue (sclera, dermis), and autogenous tissue (fascia lata, temporalis fascia, posterior auricular muscle, rectus abdominis sheath).|$|E

2500|$|A {{commonly}} used synthetic material is PLA - polylactic acid. This is a polyester which degrades within {{the human body}} to form lactic acid, a naturally occurring chemical which is easily removed from the body. Similar materials are <b>polyglycolic</b> acid (PGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL): their degradation mechanism {{is similar to that}} of PLA, but they exhibit respectively a faster and a slower rate of degradation compared to PLA. While these materials have well maintained mechanical strength and structural integrity, they exhibit a hydrophobic nature. [...] This hydrophobicity inhibits their biocompatibility, which makes them less effective for in vivo use as tissue scaffolding. In order to fix the lack of biocompatibility, much research has been done to combine these hydrophobic materials with hydrophilic and more biocompatible hydrogels. While these hydrogels have a superior biocompatibility, they lack the structural integrity of PLA, PCL, and PGA. By combining the two different types of materials, researchers are trying to create a synergistic relationship that produces a more biocompatible tissue scaffolding.|$|E

50|$|Polyglycolide or <b>poly(glycolic</b> acid) (PGA), also spelled as <b>polyglycolic</b> acid, is a biodegradable, {{thermoplastic}} polymer and {{the simplest}} linear, aliphatic polyester. It {{can be prepared}} starting from glycolic acid by means of polycondensation or ring-opening polymerization. PGA has been known since 1954 as a tough fiber-forming polymer. Owing to its hydrolytic instability, however, its use has initially been limited. Currently polyglycolide and its copolymers (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) with lactic acid, poly(glycolide-co-caprolactone) with ε-caprolactone and poly (glycolide-co-trimethylene carbonate) with trimethylene carbonate) are widely used as a material for the synthesis of absorbable sutures and are being evaluated in the biomedical field.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the name}} [...] "Vicryl" [...] is a {{trademark}} of Ethicon, the term [...] "vicryl" [...] {{has been used}} generically referring to any synthetic absorbable suture made primarily of <b>polyglycolic</b> acid. Other brands of <b>polyglycolic</b> acid suture include PolySyn, Surgicryl, Polysorb and Dexon, {{all of which are}} manufactured by different companies. Vicryl is a copolymer of lactide (a cyclic diester of lactic acid) and glycoside. In practice, vicryl comes as braided, dyed or undyed with the following decay schedule: 75% at 2 weeks, 50% at 3 weeks, and 25% at 4 weeks (i.e., the sutures retain that proportion of tensile strength at those dates).|$|E
50|$|Sensory loss, {{scarring}} and neuroma formation {{can cause}} morbidity to the donor {{site of the}} patient the nerve is harvested from. Therefore, alloplastic nerve graft research is being conducted for nerve repair. Silicone has been used previously, but long-term use of tubes produces compression and decreased conduction, requiring surgery to remove the tube. Conduits made from <b>polyglycolic</b> acid, a bioabsorbable substance used for dissolvable sutures, reduce {{the problems associated with}} silicone and eliminate problems associated with nerve grafts taken from donors. In a study on nerve repair comparing nerve grafts and <b>polyglycolic</b> acid conduits, there was no statistical differences, but 2-point discrimination showed that the conduit group was better at eliminating donor-site morbidity {{as a result of the}} graft.|$|E
5000|$|It {{can be used}} as {{a tissue}} {{replacement}} for repairing bony defects when autogenous bone graft is not feasible or possible.

50|$|Although most {{surgical}} staples {{are made}} of titanium, stainless steel is more often used in some skin staples and clips. Titanium produces less reaction with the immune system and, being non-ferrous, does not interfere significantly with MRI scanners, although some imaging artifacts may result. Synthetic absorbable (bioabsorbable) staples are also now becoming available, based on <b>polyglycolic</b> acid, as with many synthetic absorbable sutures.|$|E
50|$|Permanent meshes {{remain in}} the body, whereas {{temporary}} ones dissolve over time. For example, TIGR Matrix test mesh was shown in 2012 to fully dissolve after {{three years in a}} scientific trial on sheep. Some types of mesh combine permanent and temporary meshes such as Vipro, which includes both re-absorbable vipryl, made from <b>polyglycolic</b> acid, and prolene, a non-reabsorbable polypropylene.|$|E
5000|$|Davis and Geck's most {{significant}} contribution to the surgical field was the invention of the synthetic absorbable suture. Its Dexon brand of sutures, introduced in the 1970s, was made with a man made organic material called <b>polyglycolic</b> acid. This new category of suture product reduced a surgeon's reliance on animal derived [...] "catgut" [...] sutures which have inconsistent strength properties and can often cause significant wound irritation to patients.|$|E
50|$|All sutures are {{classified}} as either absorbable or non-absorbable {{depending on whether the}} body will naturally degrade and absorb the suture material over time. Absorbable suture materials include the original catgut as well as the newer synthetics <b>polyglycolic</b> acid, polylactic acid, polydioxanone, and caprolactone. Absorbable (or resorbable) medical devices such as sutures are made of polymers. The polymer materials are based on one or more of five cyclic monomers: glycolide, l-lactide, p-dioxanone, trimethylene carbonate and ε-caprolactone.|$|E
50|$|Glycolic acid is {{a useful}} {{intermediate}} for organic synthesis, {{in a range of}} reactions including: oxidation-reduction, esterification and long chain polymerization. It is used as a monomer in the preparation of <b>polyglycolic</b> acid and other biocompatible copolymers (e.g. PLGA). Commercially, important derivatives include the methyl (CAS# 96-35-5) and ethyl (CAS# 623-50-7) esters which are readily distillable (b.p. 147-9 and 158-159 °C, respectively), unlike the parent acid. The butyl ester (b.p. 178-186 °C) is a component of some varnishes, being desirable because it is nonvolatile and has good dissolving properties.|$|E
5000|$|One of the company's {{long term}} {{investments}} is in <b>polyglycolic</b> acid (PGA). The company developed a mass scale manufacturing technique for the chemical, {{which has been}} a development project of the company since the early 90s. [...] The company has stated a strategy of committing to invest in PGA for a long period, patiently waiting for market demand to develop. To manufacture PGA, the company invested 100 million in a manufacturing facility in Belle, West Virginia to be located nearby a Dupont plant that produces glycolic acid, a primary feedstock for PGA.|$|E
50|$|They {{are broken}} down by various {{processes}} including hydrolysis (<b>polyglycolic</b> acid) and proteolytic enzymatic degradation. Depending on the material, the process can be from ten days to eight weeks. They are used in patients who cannot return for suture removal, or in internal body tissues. In both cases, they will hold the body tissues together long enough to allow healing, but will disintegrate {{so that they do}} not leave foreign material or require further procedures. Initially, there is a foreign body reaction to the material, which is transient. After complete resorption only connective tissue will remain. Occasionally, absorbable sutures can cause inflammation and be rejected by the body rather than absorbed.|$|E
5000|$|Lycasin is a {{trade name}} given by Roquette for {{hydrogenated}} glucose syrup (hydrolysed starch). [...] One {{of the major}} components of Lycasin is maltitol, derived from the hydrogenation of maltose. Depending on the dextrose equivalent (DE) of the syrup used in the hydrolysis, a variety of products can be made, with the name [...] "lycasin" [...] normally being reserved for lycasin 80/55 (80 referring to the dry content and 55 to the dextrose equivalent). The other grades (e.g. 75/60 and 80/33) {{are referred to as}} Polysorb, but {{should not be confused with}} the <b>polyglycolic</b> acid suture of the same name which is produced by a different company.|$|E
50|$|The {{next great}} leap {{came in the}} twentieth century. The {{chemical}} industry drove production of the first synthetic thread in the early 1930s, which exploded into production of numerous absorbable and non-absorbable synthetics. The first synthetic absorbable was based on polyvinyl alcohol in 1931. Polyesters were developed in the 1950s, and later the process of radiation sterilization was established for catgut and polyester. <b>Polyglycolic</b> acid was discovered in the 1960s and implemented in the 1970s. Today, most sutures are made of synthetic polymer fibers. Silk and, rarely, gut sutures are the only materials still in use from ancient times. In fact, gut sutures have been banned in Europe and Japan owing to concerns regarding Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy. Silk suture is still used, mainly to secure surgical drains.|$|E
5000|$|Suture thread is {{made from}} {{numerous}} materials. The original sutures were made from biological materials, such as catgut suture and silk. Most modern sutures are synthetic, including the absorbables <b>polyglycolic</b> acid, polylactic acid, Monocryl and polydioxanone {{as well as the}} non-absorbables nylon, polyester, PVDF and polypropylene. The FDA first approved triclosan-coated sutures in 2002; they have been shown to reduce the chances of wound infection. Sutures come in very specific sizes and may be either absorbable (naturally biodegradable in the body) or non-absorbable. Sutures must be strong enough to hold tissue securely but flexible enough to be knotted. They must be hypoallergenic and avoid the [...] "wick effect" [...] that would allow fluids and thus infection to penetrate the body along the suture tract.|$|E
5000|$|Biodegradable {{polymers}} and biomaterials {{are also}} of significant interest for tissue engineering and regeneration. Tissue engineering {{is the ability}} to regenerate tissue with the help of artificial materials. The perfection of such systems can be used to grow tissues and cells in vitro or use a biodegradable scaffold to construct new structures and organs in vitro. For these uses, a biodegradable scaffold is obviously preferred as it reduces the risk of immunological reaction and rejection of the foreign object. While many of the more advanced systems are not ready for human therapeutics, there is significant positive research in animal studies. For example, it was possible to successfully grow rat smooth muscle tissue on a polycaprolactone/polylactide scaffold. Further research and development may allow for this technology to be used for tissue replacement, support, or enhancement in humans. One of the ultimate goals of tissue engineering is the creation of organs, such as the kidney, from basic constituents. A scaffolding is necessary to grow the entity into a functioning organ, after which the polymer scaffold would degrade and be safely eliminated from the body. There are reports of using <b>polyglycolic</b> acid and polylactic acid to engineer vascular tissue for heart repair. [...] The scaffold can be used to help create undamaged arteries and vessels.|$|E

Proteic materials, such as collagen or fibrin, and polysaccharidic materials, like chitosan or glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), have all proved suitable in terms of cell compatibility, but some issues with potential immunogenicity still remains. Among GAGs hyaluronic acid, possibly in combination with cross linking agents (e.g. glutaraldehyde, water-soluble carbodiimide, etc.), is one of the possible choices as scaffold material. Functionalized groups of scaffolds may be useful in the delivery of small molecules (drugs) to specific tissues. Another form of scaffold under investigation is decellularised tissue extracts whereby the remaining cellular remnants/extracellular matrices act as the scaffold. Recently a range of nanocomposites biomaterials are fabricated by incorporating nanomaterials within polymeric matrix to engineer bioactive scaffolds.|$|E

Drilling 1 mm holes into the implant at the muscle insertion sites is performed to facilitate vascularization of hydroxyapatite implants. Tenon’s fascia is drawn over the implant and closed in one or two layers. The conjunctiva is then sutured. A temporary ocular conformer is inserted at the completion of the pro- cedure and is worn until the patient receives a prosthesis 4 to 8 weeks after surgery.An elective secondary procedure is required to place the coupling peg or post in those patients who desire improved prosthetic motility. That procedure is usually delayed for at least 6 months after enucleation to allow time for implant vascularization. Technetium bone or gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans are not now universally used, but they have been used to conﬁrm vascularization before peg insertion. Under local anesthesia, a conjunctival incision is created at the peg insertion site. A hole is created into the porous implant to allow insertion of the peg or post.The prosthesis is then modiﬁed to receive the peg or post. Some surgeons have preplaced coupling posts in porous polyethylene implants at the time of enucleation. The post may spontaneously expose or is externalized in a later procedure via a conjunctival incision.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe high retear rates {{after surgery}} for {{irreparable}} rotator cuff tears {{can be explained}} by the healing capacity potential of tendons and the native rotator cuff enthesis characterised by complex morphological structures, called direct insertion.

This <b>polyglycolic</b> acid–collagen tube was implanted into a 10 -mm gap created by transection of the right phrenic nerve in 9 beagle dogs. The tubes were implanted without a tissue covering in 5 of the 9 dogs (group I), and the tubes were covered with a pedicled pericardial fat pad in 4 dogs (group II). Chest x-ray films, muscle action potentials, and histologic samples were examined 4 to 12 months after implantation. ResultsAll of the dogs survived without any complications. X-ray film examination showed that the right diaphragm was paralyzed and elevated in all dogs until 3 months after implantation. At 4 months, movement of the diaphragm in the implanted side was observed during spontaneous breathing in 1 dog of group I and in 3 dogs of group II.
