40|$|Four {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of supplemental cooling and niacin on heat stress (HS) responses in vivo and in vitro in lactating dairy cows. For experiment one, lactating dairy cows were fed four levels of <b>dietary</b> <b>niacin,</b> NIASHURE® (0, 4, 8, 12 g/d) for 21 d. Heat stress decreased niacin levels in whole blood, red blood cells and plasma as compared to thermoneutral. Water intake, plasma and milk niacin concentrations increased linearly with increasing <b>dietary</b> <b>niacin</b> in HS cattle. In thermoneutral, but not HS cows, niacin increased skin temperature compared to controls suggesting niacin increased skin blood flow and sensible heat loss. In experiment 2, lactating cows were {{used to evaluate the}} impact of feed-line soaking (FLS) combined with niacin supplementation. In evaporative cooled barns, FLS reduced body temperatures; however the addition of niacin did not improve heat status of these cows. For experiment 3, 200 lactating dairy cows were used {{to determine the effects of}} conductively cooled bedding (CC) compared to feed-line soaking with fans (FLSF). Conductively cooled bedding can reduce skin and vaginal temperatures in cows after nighttime rest. However, FLSF were more effective in decreasing body temperature, as cows had lower heat parameter indices, higher milk yield and longer rest time. For experiment 4, three cell types were used to evaluate niacin in vitro. Niacin induced heat shock proteins (HSP) that protected cells during HS in transformed bovine mammary epithelial cells but not in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMEC) or bovine endometrial cells (BEND). Effect of niacin on HSP may depend on enzymes involved in DNA-binding activity of heat shock factor 1. These results suggest that niacin may be involved in whole body metabolism during heat stress and is cell dependent. We did not find <b>dietary</b> <b>niacin</b> to be commercially efficacious in treating HS in cows. Further research is warranted to improve efficacy of CC and FLSF under high temperature humidity index conditions...|$|R
40|$|Swine Industry Day, 2014 {{is known}} as Swine Day, 2014 A total of 1, 232 pigs (PIC 337 × 1050; {{initially}} 59. 4 lb) were used in a 98 -d study to evaluate the influence of increasing <b>dietary</b> <b>niacin</b> supplementation on growth, body temperatures, and meat quality of pigs raised in a commercial facility during the summer. There were 28 pigs per pen and 11 pens per treatment. Basal diets contained corn, soybean meal, and dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS). The four dietary treatments were formed by adding increasing levels of nicotinic acid {{as the source of}} niacin (Lonza, Allendale, NJ) at 14, 172, 331, and 490 mg/lb of complete feed. On d 57, 58, and 59, rectal temperatures and skin temperatures {{on the top of the}} shoulder and rump were collected from 2 pigs per pen (1 barrow and 1 gilt). On d 98, 2 pigs per pen (1 barrow and 1 gilt) were visually selected as the heaviest pigs in the pen and were harvested for carcass and meat quality data. Carcass traits, pH decline, and subjective loin color and marbling scores were measured at a commercial abattoir. Afterward, a 15. 7 -in. segment of the loin was used for meat quality analysis, including measurements of ultimate pH and purge loss. Boneless chops (1 in. thick) were cut from the loin segment and were used to determine 24 -h drip loss, subjective color and marbling, objective lean color values (L*, lightness; a*, redness; and b*, yellowness), and muscle niacin concentrations. Average daily temperatures within the barn ranged from 63. 8 to 85. 5 °F throughout the length of the study, with daily low temperatures from 59. 9 to 81. 0 °F and daily high temperatures from 66. 1 to 93. 3 °F. Overall, temperature was cooler than expected for the facility compared with normal seasonal increases associated with the summer months. Time × day interactions (P < 0. 01) were observed for rectal, shoulder, and rump temperatures; however, body temperature was not consistently influenced by <b>dietary</b> <b>niacin</b> concentrations during the collection period. Overall (d 0 to 98), increasing <b>dietary</b> <b>niacin</b> did not influence ADG or F/G, but it tended (linear; P = 0. 07) to increase ADFI. Increasing niacin supplementation did not influence carcass traits; however, for meat quality, it did increase (linear; P < 0. 01) pH decline at 45 min and 21 h postmortem. Increases (linear; P < 0. 05) in a* and b* were observed for chops from pigs fed increasing niacin, but subjective chop color scores were not affected by increasing niacin supplementation. In summary, <b>dietary</b> <b>niacin</b> above the animal’s requirement estimate did not consistently influence rectal or skin temperatures and had negligible influences on growth performance, carcass traits, and meat quality parameters...|$|R

40|$|Niacin is {{required}} to form NAD and NADP, which are involved in many essential redox reactions in cellular metabolism. In addition, NAD+ acts as a substrate {{for a variety of}} ADP-ribosylation reactions, including poly- and mono-ADP-ribosylation of proteins, formation of cyclic ADP-ribose, and the generation of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose in deacetylation reactions. These nonredox reactions are critical in the regulation of cellular metabolism, and they are sensitive to <b>dietary</b> <b>niacin</b> status. There are 4 known mechanisms by which ADP-ribosylation reactions directly regulate chromatin structure. These include the covalent modification of histones with poly(ADP-ribose), the extraction of histones from chromatin by noncovalent binding to poly(ADP-ribose) on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1, poly ADP-ribosylation of telomeric repeat-binding factor- 1 within telomeres, and deacetylation of histones by the sirtuins.

40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} (UVR) {{is becoming}} recognised {{as a potential}} stress factor in aquatic systems, which may have deleterious consequences for finfish aquaculture. Most significantly, UVR is able to induce photochemical changes in DNA, either through direct absorption of incident photons or through the generation of reactive oxygen species. In mammals, it is recognised that a sufficient supply of <b>dietary</b> <b>niacin</b> {{is necessary for the}} maintenance of genomic stability, although such information is not available for fish. Therefore, this study investigates the induction of DNA damage by UVR in a representative fish (EPC-A 1) and mammalian cell line (CHO-K 1) and whether <b>dietary</b> <b>niacin</b> supplementation can ameliorate these effects. To this end the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) or 'comet' assay was used to quantify the induction of DNA SSBs. The assay was first optimised and validated using reference chemical genotoxins (H 20 2, EMS), before UVR-induced DNA damage was assessed. Subsequently, the efficacy of niacin supplementation (0. 18, 0. 56, 1. 0 mM) in reducing UYR-induced DNA damage was evaluated. During these experiments it was found that that both the reference genotoxins (H 20 2, EMS) and UVR were capable of inducing increased levels of DNA SSBs in fish and mammalian cells, in comparison to untreated controls. However, optimisation results showed that neither increasing unwinding nor electrophoresis time increased the extent DNA strand migration. Validation with EMS showed no significant differences in sensitivity to chemically-induced DNA damage between the two cell lines, although EPC-A 1 cells where found to be more sensitive to UYR-induced DNA damage. This was exhibited as a significant increase in DNA damage at a lower dose of UVR than in the CHO-K 1 cells (120 J/m² compared to 180 J/m²). Niacin supplementation was effective in reducing UVR-induced DNA damage to background levels in the CHO-K 1 cells. Contrastingly, niacin supplementation made no significant difference to UVR-induced DNA damage in EPC-A 1 cells. These results confirm that niacin is important for the maintenance of genomic stability in mammalian cells. The possible beneficial effect of dietary micronutrient supplementation for reducing UYR-induced DNA damage in farmed finfish remains undefined. Recommendations for further research are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Dairy Research, 2009 {{is known}} as Dairy Day, 2009 Niacin (nicotinic acid) can {{suppress}} lipolysis, but responses to <b>dietary</b> <b>niacin</b> have been inconsistent in cattle. A widely used commercial feed additive, niacin is thought to reduce heat stress and decrease postpartum plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration.

Recently, an encapsulated niacin (EN) product with an estimated 40 % bioavailability became commercially available, but its effects on health and metabolism in transition cows have not been tested previously. Twenty-two Holstein cows were used in a study beginning 21 days before expected calving; cows were assigned to the EN treatment (24 g/day) or control group until 21 days postpartum. Results showed that EN decreased peak plasma NEFA and ketone concentrations after calving but also caused a 9 lb/day decrease in dry matter intake during the final 4 days before calving in multiparous cows. These results indicate that a high dose of EN can decrease postpartum plasma NEFA and ketones but also may decrease prepartum dry matter intake...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The {{bioavailability}} of niacin from tuna fish, {{peanut butter}} and whole wheat bread was estimated in eight men aged 21 to 30 years. Following a 10 -day adjustment period, each test food, which was added to a constant basal diet, was fed for 14 days; {{the order in which}} these three foods were eaten was randomized. Of the total <b>dietary</b> <b>niacin</b> intake, tuna fish supplied 68 percent of the preformed niacin and 35 percent of the tryptophan, peanut butter supplied 70 percent of preformed niacin and 47 percent of the tryptophan intake, while whole wheat bread supplied only 34 percent of preformed niacin and 23 percent of tryptophan intake. The bioavailability of niacin was assessed by comparing the total intake of niacin equivalents to the total excretion of N'-methylnicotinamide (N'-Me) and N'-methyl- 2 -pyridone- 5 -carboxainide (2 -pyridone) in 24 -hour urine specimens collected on days 12 and 14 of each experimental period.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n[*]=[*] 21) were initially divided into 2 groups of seven and fourteen rats; the group of 14 rats was fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) and the other group of 7 rats consumed the control diet. Eight weeks after the diet regimen started, half of the rats from the HFD group were shifted to the niacin-supplemented diet (HFND; 1 [*]mg niacin/kg diet) while the remaining rats continued on the HFD for another 6 weeks. Results obtained showed that HFD-fed obese rats exhibited significant increase in body weight gain, reduced glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and increased adiposity, as well as altered lipid profile after 8 weeks of feeding compared with the controls. However, niacin-supplemented rats showed reduced weight gain and body weight compared with HFD-induced obese rats {{even in the absence}} of a significant difference in the food intake among the groups in the experiment. In addition, the rats showed an improved time-course glucose control and insulin sensitivity as demonstrated by a significantly lower area under curve (AUC) values for the glucose curves. The plasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and low density lipoprotein (LDL) returned towards control values in rats supplemented with niacin compared with obese rats. The findings suggest that niacin exerts beneficial effect on adiposity, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and plasma lipids, and that it specifically modulates the level of serum adiponectin under obese condition...|$|R

30|$|Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} (NAD+) is {{a central}} metabolic cofactor in eukaryotic cells that plays {{a critical role in}} regulating cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis. NAD+ in its reduced form (i.e. NADH) serves as the primary electron donor in mitochondrial respiratory chain, which involves adenosine triphosphate production by oxidative phosphorylation. The NAD+/NADH ratio also regulates the activity of various metabolic pathway enzymes such as those involved in glycolysis, Kreb’s cycle, and fatty acid oxidation. Intracellular NAD+ is synthesized de novo from l-tryptophan, although its main source of synthesis is through salvage pathways from <b>dietary</b> <b>niacin</b> as precursors. NAD+ is utilized by various proteins including sirtuins, poly ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) and cyclic ADP-ribose synthases. The NAD+ pool is thus set by a critical balance between NAD+ biosynthetic and NAD+ consuming pathways. Raising cellular NAD+ content by inducing its biosynthesis or inhibiting the activity of PARP and cADP-ribose synthases via genetic or pharmacological means lead to sirtuins activation. Sirtuins modulate distinct metabolic, energetic and stress response pathways, and through their activation, NAD+ directly links the cellular redox state with signaling and transcriptional events. NAD+ levels decline with mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced NAD+/NADH ratio is implicated in mitochondrial disorders, various age-related pathologies as well as during aging. Here, I will provide an overview of the current knowledge on NAD+ metabolism including its biosynthesis, utilization, compartmentalization and role in the regulation of metabolic homoeostasis. I will further discuss how augmenting intracellular NAD+ content increases oxidative metabolism to prevent bioenergetic and functional decline in multiple models of mitochondrial diseases and age-related disorders, and how this knowledge could be translated to the clinic for human relevance.|$|R

40|$|Introduction This work {{investigated}} in a UK prospective cohort study, firstly, the aetiology of gallstone disease, and secondly, that of pancreatic cancer, {{with a focus}} on physical activity and diet. The epidemiological studies benefitted from the accuracy of measurement tools, namely a validated physical activity questionnaire and a sevenday food diary (7 -DFD). These novel methods aided the improved definition of risk factors thus highlighting biological mechanisms leading to disease and methods of prevention. The third investigation was a clinical survey evaluating benefits for patients of a Pancreatic Support Service (PASS), which screened and treated nutritional and depressive symptoms in patients with pancreatic cancer. Methods The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer-Norfolk enrolled 25 639 men and women, aged 45 - 74 years, between 1993 - 1997, measuring anthropometrics, lifestyle factors, diet with 7 -DFDs, physical activity and collecting serum samples at baseline. The cohort was followed up until 2010, with multi-variate hazard ratios calculated for incident symptomatic gallstones and pancreatic cancer according to risk factors. The clinical survey, compared survival, doses of chemotherapy and clinical parameters in a retrospective group of 16 patients and then in a prospective group of 19 patients who were also reviewed by PASS. Results For gallstone disease, positive associations were found for obesity, serum triglycerides, dietary calcium and trans fatty acids, with inverse associations for serum HDL, physical activity, alcohol, caffeinated coffee and <b>dietary</b> <b>niacin,</b> cholesterol and iron intake. Pancreatic cancer had inverse associations detected for physical activity, dietary docosahexaenoic acid, dietary vitamin E and selenium, and serum vitamin C. The survey found those reviewed by PASS had fewer and shorter hospital admissions with no effects on survival or doses of chemotherapy. Conclusion This work found associations between various dietary factors and physical activity for both symptomatic gallstones and pancreatic cancer. These findings have implications in understanding biological mechanisms and could lead to preventative public health measures for both diseases. The survey reported the introduction of PASS was associated with a reduced number and duration of hospital admissions and the reasons for this should be explored in future work. *Submitted with two peer-reviewed articles which have not been uploaded to the repository.

Previous data showed that Trp conversion into kynurenine (Kyn) and nicotinamide (Nam) differs among studies, and such differences cannot be explained by different <b>dietary</b> <b>niacin</b> supplies. We hypothesized that pig genotype influences Trp metabolism and thus the conversion of Trp into its metabolites. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare plasma appearance of Trp and related metabolites in 12 Duroc and 12 Piétrain crossbred postweaning pigs fed 2 contrasting dietary Trp levels. Within each genotype, 6 pigs were fed a basal (B-Trp: 17 % and 15 % standardized ileal digestible [SID] Trp:Lys for starter and prestarter diets) or supplemented (S-Trp: 24 % and 23 % SID Trp:Lys for starter and prestarter diets) Trp diet. Growth was monitored, and plasma fasted concentrations were measured over 4 wk, and then pigs were fitted with a jugular catheter for frequent blood samplings. After overnight fasting, 350 g of the experimental diets were offered to each pig, and plasma concentrations of Trp, Kyn, Nam, and 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) were measured for 6 h. The activities of Trp-degrading enzymes were measured in different tissues collected after pig slaughtering. Plasma Trp fasted concentrations did not differ between B-Trp and S-Trp diets and increased from weaning to 2 and 4 wk after weaning for Piétrain but not for Duroc crossbred pigs (time × genotype, = 0. 001). Plasma Kyn concentrations were greater 4 wk after weaning (= 0. 002) than at weaning and for Piétrain compared to Duroc genetics (= 0. 008). Plasma Nam concentrations were greater for pigs fed the S-Trp diet than for those fed the B-Trp diet (= 0. 0001) and for Duroc than for Piétrain genetic lines (= 0. 001); this difference tends to be greater at weaning than after (= 0. 055). Our data showed an increase in plasma concentrations of Trp, Kyn, Nam, and 5 -HT according to time after a meal and to the dietary Trp content. However, postprandial plasma concentrations of Trp metabolites and enzyme activities were not significantly different between Duroc and Piétrain crossbred pigs. In conclusion, our results suggest that Nam endogenous synthesis capacity from Trp is greater in Duroc than in Piétrain crossbred pigs, but this was apparent only at weaning...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effects of maize {{processing}} on the carbonization and preservation of maize kernels in the archaeological record. The shift to processing maize with lime (known as hominy production in the Eastern Woodlands and nixtamalization in Mesoamerica) in ancient times {{had the effect of}} making maize more nutritious through increasing the availability of calcium, <b>niacin,</b> <b>dietary</b> fiber, and essential amino acids.  Less understood is how this process of cooking maize in a lime solution affects the archaeological preservation of maize; if there is a clear difference in the archaeological signature of maize remains that are and are not processed this way, then this process may be identifiable in the archaeological record. To this end, an experiment was constructed analyzing the variation in size between dried and alkali processed maize kernels before and after carbonization. Results indicate that alkali processed maize kernels are less likely to fragment during carbonization. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MNutr (Interdisciplinary Health Sciences. Human Nutrition)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2008. BACKGROUND: Although {{hypoglycaemia}} is a known {{complication of}} haemodialysis, {{there is little}} information about its prevalence among patients on maintenance haemodialysis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of hypoglycaemia in patients on maintenance haemodialysis in Kenyatta National Hospital (Nairobi, Kenya) and to identify potential nutritionrelated causes of hypoglycaemia. METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive and observational study design was followed. Patients {{who had been on}} chronic maintenance haemodialysis for 3 months or longer were included in the study which was carried out from May 8 through to June 30, 2006. Random blood glucose levels were determined at baseline, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 45 minutes, and at hourly intervals thereafter {{until the end of the}} dialysis session. The prevalence of hypoglycaemia (a blood glucose level less than 3. 9 mmol/L) was then determined for the duration of haemodialysis. The relationship between minimum blood glucose levels and dietary intake, anthropometric status, primary diagnosis, co-morbid and socio-demographic factors, prescribed medication and dialysis related factors was determined. RESULTS: Among the 51 haemodialysis patients who participated in the study, the prevalence of hypoglycaemia was 16 % (n= 8). Eight percent (n= 4) of these patients were however already hypoglycaemic on initiation of dialysis. <b>Dietary</b> intake of <b>niacin</b> ((r= 0. 31; p= 0. 02), riboflavin (r= 0. 30; p= 0. 03) and vitamin B 6 (r= 0. 30; p= 0. 03) showed a significant relationship with blood glucose levels. The relationships between hypoglycaemic episodes and insulin administration (p= 0. 06), and between blood glucose levels and BMI (r= 0. 25; p= 0. 08 and protein intake (r= 0. 26; p= 0. 07) approached significance. There was no significant relationship between blood glucose levels and the duration of haemodialysis (p= 0. 942), hours of haemodialysis (p= 0. 27) and the dialysate solution used (p= 0. 12). CONCLUSIONS: Hypoglycaemia was present in 16 % of patients on maintenance haemodialysis. Potential nutritional parameters which may have contributed to lower blood glucose levels in this study include a lower <b>dietary</b> intake of <b>niacin,</b> riboflavin, and vitamin B 6. Lower protein intake and lower BMI was marginally associated with low blood glucose levels...|$|R
40|$|DANN and Handler (1941) {{stated that}} the hatched chick {{contained}} ten times as much niacin as the unincu-bated egg. This led the authors {{to suggest that the}} hatched chick is able to synthesize niacin and is therefore independent of a dietary supply of this vitamin. Snell and Quarles (1941) observed that niacin is synthesized by the chick embryo {{to the extent that the}} final amount present is twenty times that originally present in the unincubated egg. They presumed that the synthesizing powers of the embryo are retained by the chick and, if so, it would indicate that niacin is not required in the diet of the chick. Briggs et al. (1942) reported that niacin is essential in the diet of chicks for optimal growth and to prevent "chick blacktongue. " They found niacinamide equally effective in stimulating growth and preventing blacktongue. Studies by Briggs et al. (1943) indicated that a <b>dietary</b> deficiency of <b>niacin</b> in chicks was charac-terized by suboptimal growth, black-tongue, decreased food consumption, marked lowering of the niacin and Co-enzyme I content of the breast muscle, poor feather development and occasion...|$|R
40|$|Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is the {{predominant}} omega- 3 (n- 3) {{polyunsaturated fatty acid}} (PUFA) found {{in the brain and}} can affect neurological function by modulating signal transduction pathways, neurotransmission, neurogenesis, myelination, membrane receptor function, synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, membrane integrity and membrane organization. DHA is rapidly accumulated in the brain during gestation and early infancy, and the availability of DHA via transfer from maternal stores impacts the degree of DHA incorporation into neural tissues. The consumption of DHA leads to many positive physiological and behavioral effects, including those on cognition. Advanced cognitive function is uniquely human, and the optimal development and aging of cognitive abilities has profound impacts on quality of life, productivity, and advancement of society in general. However, the modern diet typically lacks appreciable amounts of DHA. Therefore, in modern populations, maintaining optimal levels of DHA in the brain throughout the lifespan likely requires obtaining <b>preformed</b> DHA via <b>dietary</b> or supplemental sources. In this review, we examine the role of DHA in optimal cognition during development, adulthood, and aging with a focus on human evidence and putative mechanisms of action...|$|R
40|$|NIACIN (nicotinic acid) is of extreme, {{importance}} in nutrition. A <b>dietary</b> deficiency of <b>niacin</b> {{may result in}} pellagra in man (Fouts et al. 1937), black tongue in dogs (Elvehjem et al. 1937), and black tongue and perosis in chicks (Briggs et al. 1942, 1943). The niacin level in eggs is low. Values of 17 to 21 ^g. per yolk and 56 to 64 ng. per albumen (Dann and Handler, 1941), 0. 73 to 0. 90 ng. per gm. of whole egg (Snell and Quarles, 1941), 0. 76 /jg. per gm. of albumen and 0. 35 tig. per gm. of yolk (Teply et al., 1942), and 0. 72 Mg. per gm. of whole egg (Cheldelin and Williams, 1942) have been reported on a fresh egg basis. When compared with values of 20 to 100 fig. per gm. of grains and meats, eggs are seen to be relatively unimportant {{as a source of}} niacin in the human diet. The National Research Council gives a tentative recommendation for the niacin intake of an adult as 15 mg. (Gortner, 1949).

40|$|Vitamin A is {{essential}} for life in all vertebrate animals. Vitamin A requirement can be met from <b>dietary</b> <b>preformed</b> vitamin A or provitamin A carotenoids, {{the most important of}} which is β-carotene. The metabolism of β-carotene, including its intestinal absorption, accumulation in tissues, and conversion to vitamin A, varies widely across animal species and determines the role that β-carotene plays in meeting vitamin A requirement. This review begins with a brief discussion of vitamin A, with an emphasis on species differences in metabolism. A more detailed discussion of β-carotene follows, with a focus on factors impacting bioavailability and its conversion to vitamin A. Finally, the literature on how animals utilize β-carotene is reviewed individually for several species and classes of animals. We conclude that β-carotene conversion to vitamin A is variable and dependent on a number of factors, which are important to consider in the formulation and assessment of diets. Omnivores and herbivores are more efficient at converting β-carotene to vitamin A than carnivores. Absorption and accumulation of β-carotene in tissues vary with species and are poorly understood. More comparative and mechanistic studies are required in this area to improve the understanding of β-carotene metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Vitamins are organic compounds, {{essential}} for normal metabolism. The human body cannot manufacture vitamins, with two exceptions: niacin, {{which can be}} synthesised from dietary tryptophan, and vitamin D, which can be synthesised when the skin is exposed to sunlight. However, <b>dietary</b> sources of <b>niacin</b> and vitamin D remain important as, depending {{on the amount of}} dietary tryptophan and level of exposure to sunlight, the amount synthesised may be insufficient {{to meet the needs of}} the body. Vitamins, or their precursors, are required in small amounts regularly from the diet. Vitamins are classified as being either fat-soluble vitamins-which are not discussed here-and those that are water soluble, comprising ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and the B group: thiamin (B 1), riboflavin (B 2), niacin (B 3), pantothenic acid (B 5), B 6 (pyridoxine, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine), biotin (B 7), folate (B 9) and cobalamin (B 12). These vitamins are not generally stored in the body, except for folate and B 12, found in the liver, and ascorbic acid occurring in many body tissues. When vitamin intakes would otherwise be too low-possible reasons include naturally low levels, processing losses, poor access to good nutrition, special needs-it may be appropriate to provide vitamins in supplements or through fortification. Some water-soluble vitamins are far more important as fortificants than others: fortification of cereal staples with thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and/or folate is performed either on a voluntary or mandatory basis in most countries around the world. Incorporation of ascorbic acid is also permitted in most countries and this is also commonly used as an antioxidant...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} assess the responsiveness of weanling pigs to increased <b>dietary</b> concentrations of <b>niacin</b> and vitamin B 12. The purpose of the {{experiment was}} to determine if the niacin and vitamin B 12 requirements of nursery pigs are greater than the NRC (1998) recommendations for 11 to 22 lb pigs. Pigs (initial weight 9. 4 lb) were fed one of four diets for a total of 35 days: 1) Negative control, common nursery diet with no added niacin or vitamin B 12; 2) Niacin, common nursery diet with 22. 7 µg/lb added niacin; 3) B 12, common nursery diet with 36. 3 µg/lb added vitamin B 12; and 4) Positive control, common nursery diet with 22. 7 µg/lb added niacin and 36. 3 µg/lb added vitamin B 12. Pigs and feeders were weighed weekly to determine average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed efficiency (ADG/ADFI). Pigs were visually scored to assess any potential niacin and vitamin B 12 deficiencies on days 14, 21, 28, and 35. No niacin x vitamin B 12 interactions were observed. During Phase I, pigs fed supplemental niacin had a greater ADFI (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) than pigs fed supplemental vitamin B 12. During Phase II, pigs fed supplemental vitamin B 12 had the greatest ADG (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and ADFI (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Overall, the pigs fed supplemental vitamin B 12 had greater ADG (P 3 ̆c 0. 001), ADFI (P 3 ̆c 0. 01), and ADG/ADFI (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) than pigs fed supplemental niacin. There were no differences among groups for visual assessment of B vitamin deficiencies. Based on these results, the niacin requirement of 10 to 40 lb pigs is not greater than 4. 5 µg/lb of diet and the vitamin B 12 requirement is greater than 3. 1 µg/lb...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 78 - 102) The {{purpose of}} this study is to determine the habitual dietary intake of macronutrients and micronutrients in type II diabetic subjects and compare them with the recommendations of Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), Diabetic Exchange List (DEL), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). Twenty-two type II diabetic subjects between the ages of 41 - 86 years old were recrnited for this study. Subjects were qualified to paiiicipate in the study if they were diabetic (glucose> 125 mg/dl) for at least three months, and nonusers of dietary supplements. The data was collected using 24 -hour dietary recall. The study results showed that among macronutrients, dietary intake of protein (p< 0. 01), fat (p< 0. 05), and trans fats (p< 0. 01) was significantly higher and dietary intake of simple carbohydrates (CHO) was significantly lower (p< 0. 01) in comparison with RDA. No significant difference was found for complex CHO intake in comparison with RDA. In addition, significant higher intake of saturnted fats (SF A) and monounsaturated fats (MUF A) and a lower intake of polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) was observed in comparison with DASH (p< 0. 01). Among the micronutrients, the <b>dietary</b> intake of <b>niacin</b> (p< 0. 05) and selenium (p< 0. 01) was significantly higher and dietary intake of calcium and magnesium were significantly lower (p< 0. 01) than RDA while no significant difference was found for other micronutrients. Furthermore, the number of exchanges from starch was not significantly different from DEL while the number of exchanges from fat was significantly higher than DEL (p <. 05). These results suggested that type II diabetic subjects do not follow dietary recommendations of RDA, DEL, and DASH diet properly and further education is necessary to infonn them of the consequences resulting from unhealthy eating habits...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis deals with a study of serum retinol and related factors in patients with epithelial tumours (cervical, endometrial, and bladder carcinoma) and non epithelial tumours (malignant melanomas and sarcomas). In addition, dietary retinol and beta carotene intakes were measured in the epithelial cancer studies. The patients with cervical cancer had significantly lower serum concentrations of retinol, carotenoids, retinol binding protein (RBP) and prealbumin (PA) and significantly higher serum copper concentrations than both healthy volunteers and hospital controls. Serum concentrations of the parameters measured were similar in patients with pre-malignant cervical changes and hospital controls. <b>Dietary</b> <b>preformed</b> retinol, total retinol and beta carotene intakes of patients with malignant and pre-malignant cervical disease {{were not significantly different}} from hospital controls. Serum concentrations of retinol, carotenoids, RBP and PA were significantly lower in patients with advanced cervical cancer than in patients with early disease. Dietary intake of retinol and beta carotene was not lower in patients with advanced disease. Notable differences in serum and dietary parameters were observed between hospital controls and volunteers, and for some parameters larger differences occurred between the two groups of controls than between hospital controls and cancer patients. Possible reasons for this are discussed. Serum concentrations of retinol, RBP, and copper were similar in endometrial cancer patients and hospital controls. Serum concentrations of carotenoids were significantly lower in endometrial cancer patients than in controls. Serum retinol and associated factors were very similar in patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and in patients previously treated for bladder cancer; {{there were no significant differences}} between these two groups and the controls. Dietary intake in the three groups were also similar. In contrast to cervical cancer, the majority of patients with endometrial and bladder carcinoma had early disease. Serum concentrations of retinol, carotenoids, RBP and PA were significantly lower in patients with sarcomas when compared to hospital controls. In contrast, in patients with malignant melanoma the level of carotenoids and prealbumin in the serum were significantly lower than in controls while levels of retinol and RBP were similar to controls. Possible reasons for the lower levels of retinol and associated factors in some groups of cancer patients are discussed. The problems and limitations of estimates of dietary vitamin A intake are also discussed. The relationships of dietary vitamin A, and serum concentrations of retinol and carotenoids to human cancer are re-evaluated...|$|R
