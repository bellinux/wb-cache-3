40|$|A three-degree-of-freedom {{mathematical}} vibration {{model of}} a high-speed <b>punching</b> <b>press</b> was developed in order to explore the vibration modes of the <b>punching</b> <b>press.</b> A multidomain model of the <b>punching</b> <b>press</b> was established to predict the kinematic state during different conditions, {{as well as the}} effects of load fluctuation on the motor speed. Experimental measurements of the acceleration of the <b>punching</b> <b>press</b> were carried out. The results comparison reveals that the multidomain model is consistent with the vibration model and the experimental measurements. Modal analysis and structure modification of the <b>punching</b> <b>press</b> were conducted. The foundation {{at the base of the}} <b>punching</b> <b>press</b> was improved against excess of vibration. The effects of the dimensions of the foundation on the vibration were discussed with the aid of the multidomain model. Finally, proper foundation design, able to reduce the vibration, was obtained...|$|R

50|$|A lot of {{organizational}} effort and interface management is saved, if the CNC <b>punch</b> <b>press</b> {{is connected to}} the previous and subsequent process. For a connection to other machines and external workstations corporate interfaces have to be established.|$|E
50|$|The <b>punch</b> <b>press</b> is {{used for}} high volume production. Cycle times are often {{measured}} milliseconds. Material yield is measured {{as a percentage of}} parts to waste per sheet processed. CAD/CAM programs maximize yield by nesting parts in the layout of the sheet.|$|E
50|$|<b>Punch</b> <b>presses</b> are {{developed}} for high flexibility and efficient processing of metal stampings. The main areas of application are for small and medium runs. Those machines are typically {{equipped with a}} linear die carrier (tool carrier) and quick change tools. Today the method is used where the application of lasers are inefficient or technically impractical.|$|R
50|$|<b>Punch</b> <b>presses</b> {{are large}} {{machines}} {{with either a}} 'C' type frame, or a 'portal' (bridge) type frame. The C type has the hydraulic ram at the top foremost part, whereas the portal frame is much akin to a complete circle with the ram being centered within the frame to stop frame deflection or distortion.|$|R

50|$|Turret type <b>punch</b> <b>press</b> {{machines}} have a {{table or}} bed with brushes or rollers {{to allow the}} sheet metal workpiece to traverse with low friction.

50|$|A <b>punch</b> <b>press</b> {{is a type}} {{of machine}} press used to cut holes in material. It can be small and {{manually}} operated and hold one simple die set, or be very large, CNC operated, with a multi-station turret and hold a much larger and complex die set.|$|E
50|$|Tube being hollow, it's not {{practical}} {{to use a}} simple punch operation to notch it, {{as it would be}} squashed. Although punching is possible, it requires support mandrels and awkward handling. Where tube is worked with a <b>punch</b> <b>press</b> other than for side notching, this is generally described as slotting.|$|E

50|$|Sheet {{metal can}} be cut in various ways, from hand tools called tin snips up to very large powered shears. With the {{advances}} in technology, sheet metal cutting has turned to computers for precise cutting. Many sheet metal cutting operations are based on computer numerically controlled (CNC) laser cutting or multi-tool CNC <b>punch</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E
50|$|Notching is a {{low-cost}} process, particularly for its low tooling costs {{with a small}} range of standard punches. The capital cost of the <b>punch</b> <b>press</b> can be expensive though, so small fabrication shops often out-source their notching work to a press shop or notching specialist. Notching of large or heavy sections, particularly for large tube fabrication or HVAC, is increasingly carried out by plasma cutting rather than punch tools.|$|E
50|$|A {{servo drive}} turret <b>punch</b> <b>press</b> uses twin AC servo drives {{directly}} coupled to the drive shaft. This drive system combines {{the simplicity of}} the original clutch and brake technology with the speed of a hydraulic ram driven system. This results in high performance, reliability, and lower operating costs. A servo drive press system has no complex hydraulics or oil-cooling chillers, thus reducing maintenance and repair costs. A turret press can be equipped with advanced technology that stores and reuses energy generated during ram deceleration, providing extended electrical power savings.|$|E
