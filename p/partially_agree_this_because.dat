50|$|There are {{conflicting}} perspectives {{regarding the}} security of tension settings. Many jewelers contend that tension settings are as safe and potentially safer than four and six prong settings, {{but there are others}} who contend that prongs are stronger. The reality is that both ring designs have weaknesses that are unique to their engineering process. Prongs can snag on clothes and other loose objects, and they weaken with time and usage. As a result, prongs must be repaired or replaced periodically. On the other hand, tension settings will not lose their spring-loading over time, and the stone will therefore not fall out {{as a result of the}} setting weakening. Critics do contend that a stone can potentially be dislodged from a tension setting if it is hit hard enough or if the setting is damaged to the point where its spring loading is compromised. Tension manufacturers <b>partially</b> <b>agree</b> with <b>this</b> statement, warning their customers that stones can be lost if the setting suffers a blunt force impact that damages the spring-loading, but they also point out that no stone has ever been lost as a result of a manufacturing defect. Overall, there is a risk that the setting can be compromised when exposed to high impact, but this is also true of prong settings and there are many examples of prongs failing and needing to be replaced or stones falling out. Tension settings on the other hand do not need to be replaced, and unless their spring-loading is damaged, are very unlikely to lose their gem stone.|$|R
40|$|Overrides {{of credit}} ratings are {{important}} correctives of ratings that {{are determined by}} statistical rating models. Financial institutions and banking regulators <b>agree</b> on <b>this</b> <b>because</b> {{on the one hand}} errors with ratings of corporates or banks can have fatal consequences for the lending institutions {{and on the other hand}} errors by statistical methods can be minimised but not completely avoided. Nonetheless, rating overrides can be misused in order to conceal the real riskiness of borrowers or even entire portfolios. That is why rating overrides usually are strictly governed and carefully recorded. It is not clear, however, which frequency of overrides is appropriate for a given rating model within a predefined time period. This paper argues that there is a natural error rate associated with a statistical rating model that may be used to inform assessment of whether or not an observed override rate is adequate. The natural error rate is closely related to the rating model’s discriminatory power and can readily be calculated...|$|R
40|$|Fiscal {{federalism}} is {{a direction}} {{of economic reform}} that embraces economic, financial, and political relations. There is an opinion {{that we do not}} yet have fiscal federalism, but it is impossible to <b>agree</b> with <b>this</b> <b>because</b> we have fiscal and tax systems, which include a complex mechanism of fiscal-tax interrelationships at various levels of authority. For the most part, these systems had already formed before the adoption of the 1993 Constitution. The block of laws [passed] at the end of 1991 introduced a three-tiered tax system and defined the principles of fiscal organization. Decentralization and a mechanism for the interaction of various levels of the fiscal system were developed in the April 15, 1993, law on principles of fiscal rights and the right to form and use off-budget funds. To a considerable degree, the possibilities this law offers for federalizing and decentralizing the fiscal-tax system have not been used, due to the destructive impact of the economic crisis on budgets at all levels. ...|$|R

50|$|Alexander Hamilton wanted electors to {{be voted}} in the same {{counties}} {{to increase the amount}} of people coming in and out of congress. Hamilton said that if we hold elections at different times then we could change the members of congress gradually and make new members. This would make it less likely for congress to lean voting towards one side every single time. Also this would allow more opportunities for others to be able to run for the positions in congress and in turn, would make for new and positive changes to previous work done by the former elects. Not many people opposed this idea. For the most the part, the majority of people <b>agreed</b> with <b>this</b> <b>because</b> it would make voting for the people in the senate and congress easier. In addition, it would allow different approaches in congress, regarding political parties. However, some people did not like it because they wanted congress to be in their favor so that way when they would vote on things it would go their way, example, either towards the democrats or republicans.|$|R

So it was his first "emperor-foundation". The church was built probably between 1352 and 1361 as well as the sculptural decoration. We can follow up an extensive iconographic programme especially on the west facade which was supposedly ordained by Charles IV himself. This type of state-representation-scheme anticipate the further famous iconology of St. Vitus Cathedral. Some scientsts suppose that the author of this monument is Peter Parler, master builder of St. Vitus Cathedral because of high parlerian character of the architecture and sculptures and by virtue of the chronology (Peter Parler came to Prague in 1356). However we can't <b>agree</b> <b>this</b> hypothesis, <b>because</b> the style reasons are too general for this proposition, they don't smite a personal style of Peter Parler. For all that we regard the best pieces of the sculpture group on the west front of the church as individual manifestation of early Parlerian style.
