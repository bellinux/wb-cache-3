40|$|Continental unconformities are {{essential}} to estimate erosion rates of crystalline basement and to model the crust dynamics that control subsidence of surrounding sedimentary basins. Dating such unconformities {{has always been the}} stumbling block to constrain geodynamical models. Paleomagnetism is a great tool to date ferrugineous paleoweathering. This method has been applied: to paleoweathering occurrences resting on the Massif central crystalline basement and reaching the Morvan crystalline basement; and to the Cretaceous ferrugineous sandstones of the Southeast border of the Paris Basin. Relative dating of these azoic formations have been acquired by comparing the recorded paleomagnetic poles from the samples with the apparent polar wander path (APWP) of the Eurasian plate The thick red kaolinitic formations from the Massif central have classically been ascribed to the "Siderolithic" (Eocene-Oligocene). These formations are arranged in clear paleolandscape features: around basement <b>paleoreliefs,</b> leaned against fault scarps, infilling paleovalleys, etc. It show well preserved pedogenic features (termites burrows, illuviation and hydromorphic features, nodules [...] .). Macro and micromorphological observations show that these formations are in situ paleosoils. Paleomagnetic datings provide ages ranging from 160 Ma (Late Jurassic) in the Naussac Basin (centre of the Massif central) to 140 Ma (Early Cretaceous) in the Lembron region (Southwest border of the Limagne graben). The Cretaceous ferrugineous deposits from the Southeast border of the Paris Basin, in the Puisaye and Sologne areas are made up of sandstones with ferrugineous cement (Early Albian Sands and Ferruginous Sandstones, La Puisaye Sands). The cement is mainly goethitic. No dating were obtained because of the instable magnetization of this mineral. A hematitic layer located {{at the base of the}} Myennes Clays gave a recent age (0 - 3 Ma). It could be related to the oxidization of a pyretic layer subsequent to groundwater flow during the formation of the present-day landscapes. The Massif central and the Morvan crystalline basements show albitized facies. It affects granites, gneiss, rhyolites and Permo-Carboniferous sediments. On granites, albitized facies are layered, with pinkish mottling at the base and reddish spotting to the top. These horizons are marked by albitization of primary plagioclases and chloritization of primary biotites. Secondary albite and chlorite contain secondary minute hematite inclusions, which have been dated by paleomagnetism to be Triassic in age. The albitized facies are related to the Triassic unconformity. Both datings and geographic distribution of the albitized formations argue for a superficial origin of these facies. Therefore, the post-magmatic or hydrothermal hypothesis classicaly proposed to explain their origin can be excluded. Paleomagnetic analyses allowed to date a large range of paleoweathering formations for which no objective datings was available. The space and time distribution of the formations and the related unconformities gives elements to highlight the geodynamic evolution of the Massif central. * Triassic, Late Jurassic and Tertiary unconformities are superimposed on large areas of the Massif central. It implies very little erosion of the crystalline basement since Triassic times, as shown by the widespread albitized triassic unconformity outcroping at present. * Datings points out that no Mesozoic cover was present on the basement of Massif central during development of the red kaolinitic paleosoils during the Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous period. Consequently, the Massif central did probably not support an important (more than 500 m) sedimentary cover during the Mesozoic. In conclusion, identification and dating of such continental unconformities give evidences for long lasting continental evolution and landscape stability of the Massif central all along the Mesozoic. Les datations des paléosurfaces continentales constituent des points d'ancrage majeurs pour contraindre l'évolution géodynamique d'une région. Le paléomagnétisme s'avère être une méthode adaptée pour dater les paléoaltérations continentales ferrugineuses. Les datations des formations rouges "sidérolithiques" du Massif central indiquent des âges s'échelonnant entre 160 Ma (Jurassique supérieur) dans le bassin de Naussac et 140 Ma (Crétacé inférieur) dans le Lembron. Sur la bordure Sud-Est du bassin de Paris, un niveau hématitique, à la base des argiles de Myennes, a fourni un âge sub-récent (0 - 3 Ma) qui pourrait souligner l'entaille des paysages actuels. Sur le socle cristallin du Massif central et du Morvan la datation des faciès albitisés a fourni un âge triasique soulignant l'origine superficielle de ces faciès. L'ancrage spatio-temporel des paléoaltérations et des paléosurfaces permet de préciser des traits majeurs de l'évolution géodynamique du Massif Central. Sur de vastes régions les paléosurfaces du Trias, du Jurassique terminal et du Tertiaire sont confondues. Il n'y a donc pas eu d'érosion conséquente du socle entre le Trias et la période actuelle, puisque la paléosurface albitisée au Trias est encore présente sur de très grandes surfaces du massif. Les datations du Jurassique supérieur/Crétacé inférieur des paléoaltérations "sidérolithiques" soulignent que le Massif Central ne présentait pas de couverture sédimentaire à cette époque. La reconnaissance et la datation de ces paléosurfaces continentales témoignent de longues périodes de continentalisation du socle et de la relative stabilité du Massif Central tout au long du Mésozoïqu...|$|R
40|$|Dans le Bassin parisien pendant l'Eocène et l'Oligocène, on dénombre vingt-deux discontinuités issues d'émersions {{correspondant}} aux périodes de bas-niveaux marins. La présence de fleuves est décelée dans les prismes de bordure de plate-forme et dans les prismes de haut niveau, remobilisant des stocks sableux anciens à partir des anticlinaux actifs et des bordures du bassin. Ainsi, indépendamment du volume disponible pour les sédiments, se succèdent des séquences dominées soit par des formations détritiques, soit par des formations carbonatées. La plate-forme parisienne a enregistré toutes les variations eustatiques connues, bien que les mouvements tectoniques syn-sédimentaires locaux puissent influencer fortement les conditions de sédimentation. Mieux encore, la plate-forme parisienne a subi des fluctuations marines d'ordre supérieur de très courte durée qui, si elles sont retrouvées dans d'autres domaines, pourront être attribuées à des phénomènes eustatiques. The Paris Basin (Map 1) is {{a classic}} example of a stable platform such as has been known throughout the World for a long time now. Aside from the Bartonian and Priabonian, all Eocene and Oligocene stages have been defined in the form of the following four international stratotypes : Sparnacian, Cuisian, Lutetian and Stampian. It should also be noted that the substages of the Bartonian (Auversian, marinesian) and the Ludian, the equivalent of the Priabonian, are also Parisian. Even though gaps have recently been redefined (C. Pomerol, 1989), though the correlations between the different formations in the basin and those of the surrounding areas (D. Curry, 1967; et al. 1969, 1978; C. Pomerol, 1977; C. Cavelier, 1979; C. Cavelier and C. Pomerol, 1986) have now been determined, and though the worldwide eustatic sea level curve was partly plotted with the help of stratotype sections (B. U. Haq et al., 1988), the Eocene and Oligocene sequence analysis of the paris Basin has as yet only been roughly sketched out. The survey was not based on seismic profiles because the Parisian Tertiary series outcrop. Therefore, our analysis is based on field observations and the abundant bibliography dealing with the Paris Basin. Recent dating of different depositional systems for each sequence is mainly due to the determining of Wetzelliaceae (J. J. Châteauneuf and C. Gruas-Cavagnetto, 1968; J. J. Châteauneuf, 1980), calcareous nannofossils (M. P. Aubry, 1983, 1985; E. Steurbaut, 1988), Characea (J. Riveline, 1984), mollusca and mammalia (C. Cavelier, 1979, 1987). We propose a time section (Plate 1 and Figs. 1 to 21) and a paleogeographic map (Maps 2 to 18) for each depositional sequence. There are 22 unconformities corresponding to large sedimentation gaps during the Eocene and Oligocene (Plate 1). They are the results of emersions and correspond to low sea levels when the sediments were situated solely in lowstand prograduring wedges or on the Shelf margin wedge but rarely present in the Paris Basin [Sequences 1 (Fig. 1), 3 (Fig. 3), 19 (Fig. 19) and 20 (Fig. 20) ]. These unconformities, bounded by depositional sequences, are often confused with transgressive surfaces on the Paris shelf and are usually revealed by erosional surfaces as well as by the presence of paleolkarsts, paleosols, eolian reworking or sandstone diagenesis. Unconformities at the Thanetian-Sparnacian, upper Cuisian-Terminal Cuisian, Cuisian-Lutetian, Mrinesian-Ludian, Ludian-Stampian and Stampian-Chattian boundaries can be recognized from the Type 1 (Plate 1). In the Paris Basin, these unconformities are major ones separating most of the stratotypic sequences. The other sequences are reparated by a Type 2 unconformity with local subaerial erosion on the edges of the Paris Gulf or on the entire area of the basin (Sequences 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19 and 20) depending on the eustatic fall and the subsidence. The presence of rivers, mainly issuing from the South and East of the basin, can be detected on the shelf margin wedges and in the highstand prograding wedges. However, there are no real paleovalleys underneath the unconformities, but at most an irregular surface that usually bears witness not to continental erosion but to gullying linked to the ensuing transgression. Formations subjected to erosion during lowstand periods are often quite unconsolidated. The <b>paleoreliefs</b> built up during emersion were easily leveled by the ensuing transgression. Likewise, outside of the tectonically active areas in the basin during the Eocene and Oligocene (Pays de Bray, Orxois dome, Rémarde anticline, Meudon anticline), which sometimes form islands (Maps 2 to 18), transgressions occurred in the rest of the basin onflat surface or one with residual reliefs of decimetric size. Like in some current drainage systems, it can be supposed that the most deeply indented paleovalleys are situated near the shelf edge during lowstand, periods. This would imply their probable existence well west of the Paris Basin near the continental slope of the werstern English Channel. An analysis of the lithology of the different depositional systems within the sequences shows an alternation or coexistance of sandy or clayey clasting sedimentation and purely carbonate sedimentation. The origin of the Parisian Tertiary sandstones has been recognized as having come successively from former Mesozoic (A. Blondeau et al., 1964) and Cenozoic (J. Riveline-Bauer, 1970; C. Lorenz et al., 1984) sandy sources. The remobilization of these sources was mainly linked to the episodic uplifting of anticlines (Pays de Bray and Artois regions mainly) and of basin edges, providing a source for coastal sedimentation with continental sandy or clayey influxes brought in by rivers in the South and the Champagne region (Maps 2 to 18). Thus, apart from the volume available for the sediments (accomodation), sequences succeeded one another in time while being dominated either by highly clastic formation or by essentially carbonate formations. The case of the Meretrix rustica limestones in the Vexin region, which are contemporary with the Auvers sandstones, is an exemplary one (Fig. 9, Map 10). The regions sheltered from sandy influxes (the Vexin region at the time was a marginal marine domain backed up against a chalky hinterland and isolated from the main gulf by the Pays de Bray Island and the Sables d'Auversoffshore bars) could at the same time gather in a purely carbonate sedimentation. These same limestones east of Vexin become calcareous sandstones associated with Auvers sandstones. A sequence analysis of the Eocene-Oligocene in the Paris Basin also reveals that the Soisson lignites were deposited in the midst of an upper highstand systems tract and then were marked at the level of the paleosols by the presence of a late highstand systems tract (Fig. 1, Map 2). Initially, they were in a coastal plain environment associated with prograding coastal deltaic systems and then with fluvial outwash plains. On the contrary, the Epernay lignites belong to a late lowstand wedge (Fig. 3, Map 4) and indicated the presence of palustrine environment between the emerged areas and the oyster lagoons, which themselves were sheltered by offshore bars present in the aggrading Laon sands. Elsewhere, when the gypsums in the Paris Basin are of marine origine [Lutetian gypsums (Figs. 6 and 7), fourth, third and second Gypsum Masses (Figs. 14, 15 and 16) ], they belong to an early highstand systems tract. However, the first Gypsum Mass and the Marabet Bank, which are of continental origin, are part of a late highstand systems tract (Figs. 16 and 17). The great central subsidence of the basin at that time left a log of space available, but the slight subsidence of the edges, especially in the NW, and the great lowering of the sea level served to isolate a very thick continental evaporitic basin in the depocenter area. The depositional sequences thus described show, on the whole, a very close correlation with the eustatic sea level curve (B. U. Haq et al., 1988) since this curve was plotted, among others, from stratotype sections. The Parisian platform underwent all the eustatic variations known on a worldwide scale, even though some local synsedimentary tectonic movements (A. Blondeau et al., 1964, C. Pomerol, 1967; R. Wyns, 1978; C. Cavelier and C. Pomerol, 1979; C. Mégnien, 1980; C. Lorenz, 1984) may have strongly influence the conditions of sedimentation (Maps 2 to 18), revealing moreover the persistance during this entire period of active tectonic structures such as the Pays de Bray, and also the migration of the depocenter in the Paris Basin for each depositional sequence. Better yet, the Parisian platform underwent marine fluctuations lasting very briefly and which, if they are found in other stable domains, may be attributed to eustatic sea level phenomena...|$|R

40|$|On the {{controversial}} nature of paleosols related to shallow marine carbonate depositional environments Recognition {{of the importance}} of exposure related features in shallow water carbonate sequences dates back to the late fifties–early sixties. They have raised interest first among sedimentologists working in carbonate diagenesis, then, as soon as the obvious implications in petroleum geology were recognized the study of paleosols/paleokarst and the related porosity evolution began to receive considerable industrial support. Paleosols occurring in shallow marine carbonate sequences are generally divided into two main groups: (a) paleosols related to long-lasting (tectonically controlled) exposure at major regional unconformities, (b) intraformational paleosols occurring in cyclically organized sequences where marine sedimentation is repeatedly interrupted by shorter or longer episodes of non-deposition and subaerial exposure (of either intrinsic or extrinsic control). Representatives of the first group are bauxites, terrae rossae and certain calcretes. They have received attention mainly from scholars of paleokarst and bauxites and much less from soil scientists proper. The reason for that is probably that they are soil derived sediments rather than in situ soils. Because of the long exposure and the associated usually mature <b>paleorelief</b> they are often used as paleotopographic indicators in areas whic...|$|E

The positive gravity anomalies located near the Atlantic coast are due to 535 and 540  Ma old rocks belonging to the Pampean Orogeny (Precambrian–middle Cambrian), which are widely recognized in central and northern Argentina. The Famatinian Cycle (Ordovician–Devonian) is represented by a Silurian–Devonian marine basin equivalent to those of eastern-central Argentina and South Africa, and which was deformed {{at the end of the}} Devonian by an ∼E–W to WNW–ESE compressional event, part of the Famatinian Orogeny.

This deformation event belongs to the Gondwanide Orogeny that includes movements related to a counterclockwise rotation of blocks in northern Patagonia.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the putative Pliocene–Quaternary removal of mantle lithosphere {{from beneath the}} southern Sierra Nevada region using a synthesis of subsidence data from the Great Valley, and geomorphic relations across the Sierra Nevada. These findings are {{used to test the}} results and predictions of thermomechanical modeling of the lithosphere removal process that is specific to the Sierra Nevada, as presented in an accompanying paper referenced here as Part I. Our most successful thermomechanical model and the observational data that it explains are further bundled into an integrated physiographic evolution–geodynamic model for the three-dimensional epeirogenic deformation field that has affected mainly the southern Sierra Nevada–San Joaquin Basin region as a result of underlying mantle lithosphere removal. The coupled Sierra Nevada mountain range and Great Valley basin are recognized as a relatively rigid block (Sierra Nevada microplate) moving within the San Andreas–Walker Lane dextral plate juncture system. Our analysis recognizes that the Sierra Nevada possessed kilometer-scale local and regional paleotopographic relief, and that the Great Valley forearc basin possessed comparable structural relief on its principal stratigraphic horizons, both dating back to the end of Cretaceous time. Such ancient <b>paleorelief</b> must be accounted for in considering late Cenozoic components of uplift and subsidence across the microplate. We further recognize that Cenozoic rock and surface uplift must be considered from the perspectives of both local epeirogeny driven by mantle lithosphere removal, and regional far-field–forced epeirogeny driven by plate tectonics and regional upper-mantle buoyancy structure. Stratigraphic relations of Upper Cretaceous and lower Cenozoic marine strata lying on northern and southern Sierra Nevada basement provide evidence for near kilometer-scale rock uplift in the Cenozoic. Such uplift is likely to have possessed positive, and then superposed negative (subsidence) stages of relief generation, rendering net regional rock and surface uplift. Accounting for ancient <b>paleorelief</b> and far-field–driven regional uplift leaves a residual pattern whereby ∼ 1200 m of southeastern Sierra crest rock and similar surface uplift, and ∼ 700 m of spatially and temporally linked tectonic subsidence in the southern Great Valley were required in the late Cenozoic by mantle lithosphere removal. These values are close to the predictions of our modeling, but application of the model results to the observed geology is complicated by spatial and temporal variations in the regional tectonics that probably instigated mantle lithosphere removal, as well as spatial and temporal variations in the observed uplift and subsidence patterns. Considerable focus is given to these spatial-temporal variation patterns, which are interpreted to reflect a complex three-dimensional pattern resulting from the progressive removal of mantle lithosphere from beneath the region, as well as its epeirogenic expressions. The most significant factor is strong evidence that mantle lithosphere removal was first driven by an east-to-west pattern of delamination in late Miocene–Pliocene time, and then rapidly transitioned to a south-to-north pattern of delamination in the Quaternary...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Carnian {{sandstones}} ofthe Southern Alps are fluviodeltaic and lagoonal clastic wedges {{derived from}} volcanic source rocks changing with time from mesosilicic to persilicic lavas and pyroclastics. Two-thirds {{of the variance}} in detfital modes reflect this petrologic evolution of the source. The effect of sedimentary processes i never strong enough to obscure the fundamental relationship of sandstone composition to provenance, but it accounts for most short-term variability in quartz/feldspar and feldspar/ volcanic rock fragment ratios. Plagioclase and quartz grains are concentrated, respectively, in the very fine to fine fractions and in medium-grained sandstones. The quartz/feldspar ratio (Q/F) thus decreases through delta-plain upward-fining sequences, from channel-lag sediments (Q/F = V 3) to overbank sands (Q/F = t/a). The sedimentary control on the composition of flaviodeltaic sands results from the coupling of mechanical effects in high-gradient headwater streams and hydraulic sorting in low-gradient depositional environments. Assuming that the effectiveness of mineralogical segregation i different grain-size fractions during transport depends primarily on <b>paleorelief,</b> a decrease in altitude during Carnian times is inferred within the Triassic volcanic source, which lay south of the sedimentary depocenter. Reworking by weak traction currents in lagoonal settings has further increased the textural maturity and the mineralogical stability of the sands. Volcanic rock fragments were reduced by selective destruction i marine environments, but the Q/F ratio was not affected, and a common value of V 6 characterizes all lagoonal strata...|$|E

Hf isotopic results indicate that these three magmatic and tectonic episodes did not give rise to significant production of juvenile crust. A distinguishable group of Triassic zircons, around 250 - 200 Ma which is considered to derive from the Southern Alps, has been detected in the Early Oligocene "Schistes à Blocs" formation and the Brianconnais “Flysch Noir”. In contrast, this age group is absent in Late Eocene-Earliest Oligocene sandstones. In agreement with sedimentological studies, our {{results show that the}} main source areas of the Eocene sandstone were probably located in the European continent. The arrival of detritus from the Internal Zone occurred in Early Oligocene, coeval with the tectonic rotation from northwestward to westward in the propagation of allochthonous units. Based on previous studies and our new data, we argue that the the Brianconnais Zone was likely a <b>paleorelief</b> since the Middle Eocene that accounts for the lack of detritus from the Adriatic units. Contemporary sediments were accumulated in the foredeep of the Adriatic Plate. From Oligocene time onwards, the blockage was cut through after a regional uplifting, and thus the Internal Zone started to provide detritus into the western flexural basins...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The Bjelovar Sub-basin is {{situated}} in Northern Croatia and constitutes the southwestern branch of the Drava Basin. The Neogene-Quaternary sedimentary section can be subdivided into three megacycles, which are separated by regional unconformities. The data analyzed {{in this study are}} related to the first megacycle, which is characterized by a tectonic-erosional unconformity above the Neogene basement (electric log, abbr. e-log marker Pt or Tg); its top is the regional e-log marker Rs 7. It is generally assumed that the Rs 7 marker separates Sarmatian and Pannonian sediments and indicates the period just after the first transtensional and first transpressional events. The youngest elog marker, Rs 5, represents the Lower/Upper Pannonian boundary (in Croatian stratigraphic nomenclature) and more generally the early period of the second transtensional event. The lithology of the Lower and Middle Badenian is characterized by coarse and medium-grained sediments, while the Upper Badenian to Lower Pannonian section is dominantly pelitic as a result of flattening of the eroded <b>paleorelief,</b> as well as of reduced amounts of fans and energy. Thickness maps for the stratigraphic intervals Pt/Tg-Rs 7 (4. 9 Ma) and Rs 7 -Rs 5 (2. 2 Ma) were statistically analyzed using a regular grid with individual cells of 500 × 500 m. It is demonstrated that the first transpressional event in this sub-basin continued during the Lower Pannonian, causing a significant decrease of sediment thickness and a large unconformity in the east. Statistics based on histograms and averages confirmed that the first transtension and first transpression can be clearly distinguished by the presented methodology...|$|E
40|$|The {{elevation}} {{history of}} Earth's surface {{is key to}} understanding the geodynamic processes responsible for the rise of plateaus. We investigate the timing of Colorado Plateau uplift by estimating depositional temperatures of Tertiary lake sediments that blanket the plateau interior and adjacent lowlands using carbonate clumped isotope paleothermometry (a measure of the temperature-dependent enrichment of ^(13) C-^(18) O bonds in carbonates). Comparison of modern and ancient samples deposited near sea level provides an opportunity to quantify the influence of climate and therefore assess the contribution of changes in elevation to the variations of surface temperature on the plateau. Analysis of modern lake calcite from 350 to 3300 m elevation in the southwestern United States reveals a lake water carbonate temperature (LCT) lapse rate of 4. 2 ± 0. 6 °C/km. Analysis of Miocene deposits from 88 to 1900 m elevation in the Colorado River drainage suggests that the ancient LCT lapse rate was 4. 1 ± 0. 7 °C/km, and temperatures were 7. 7 ± 2. 0 °C warmer at any one elevation than predicted by the modern trend. The inferred cooling is plausible in light of Pliocene temperature estimates {{off the coast of}} California, and the consistency of lapse rates through time supports the interpretation that there has been little or no elevation change for any of the samples since 6 Ma. Together with previous <b>paleorelief</b> estimates from apatite (U-Th) /He data from the Grand Canyon, our results suggest most or all of the plateau's lithospheric buoyancy was acquired ∼ 80 – 60 Ma and do not support explanations that ascribe most plateau uplift to Oligocene or younger disposal of either the Farallon or North American mantle lithosphere...|$|E
40|$|New {{observations}} {{in the central}} Belgian Brussels Sands (transition Lower to Middle Eocene) allow to build a consistent model of the sedimentary processes and facies relationships of the deposit. The Brussels Sands fill a 120 km long and 40 km wide lowstand complex valley incision, correlated with the Yp 10 50. 0 Ma global lowstand. A marine transgression penetrated into the incised valleys transforming them first into estuaries and then into a tidal marine embayment. The sediment fill has a highstand signature. Filling started at the western bank, probably fed by a continuous coastal drift inferred to have existed along the southern North Sea coast. The West to East lateral progradation of the embayment shore created the “westerly lateral accretion” arrangement which dominates the Brussels Sands sedimentary record. This arrangement contains many gravity flow deposits, thought {{to be caused by}} breach failure. That mechanism conveyed coarser-grained sand from the embayment shore environment to the embayment floor. As the hydraulic section of the embayment narrowed, “flow-section restriction” events became more frequent, on either local or regional scale, depending on the presence and magnitude of intraformational relief and inherited <b>paleorelief</b> highs. Due to the section restriction, flow currents were increased locally causing lateral and vertical erosion to generate a short-lived accommodation space increase. Sedimentation outpaced the space creation rate and the narrowing channels and scour pits were filled with thick cross beds. Each time after filling the local space, the westerly lateral accretion resumed. The embayment closed with the deposition of the coarse glauconite sands in the East of the basin. A successive sea-level rise, following Lu 1 at 48. 1 Ma, caused a marine ravinement to truncate at least 10 to 20 metres of the top of the Brussels Sands...|$|E
40|$|A major {{volcanic}} {{episode is}} recorded across the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian transition in the Moroccan Anti-Atlas. Several volcanic cones are still {{preserved in the}} El Graara massif, laterally correlatable with volcanic flows dated as Early Cambrian (U/Pb date of 534 +/- 10 Ma). Volcanic ashes and flows are interbedded with the uppermost part of the Adoudou dolostones, whereas the best-preserved volcano (the boho Jbel) is onlapped by the overlying Lie-de-Vin strata. Available petro-geochemical data fom the Boho volcano suggest an alkaline magmatism probably derived from low-grade melting of a garnet-lherzolite mantle source, followed by fractional crystallization. The silica-undersaturated basaltic liquid evolved to form oversaturated rocks: the fractionation of a ferromagnesian phase with high-Ca and low-Al contents is suggested as the main process to cut across the critical plane of silica undersaturation in this geochemical series. Although the Boho geochemical patterns {{are similar to those}} of some rift emplacements, more data from other coeval magmatic eruptions are necessary to constrain their geodynamic setting. Erosion of the Boho volcano favoured formation of a slope-apron composed of four sedimentary facies belts: chaotic megabreccia (related to downslope mass movements of rigid blocks), amalgamated breccia sheets (emplaced by viscous debris flows), a heteregeneous terrigenous belt (representing offshore substrates interrupted by channels intersected by cross-bedded shoals), and variegated shales and stromatolitic dolostones (typical of the Lie-de-vin Formation). Sharp changes in sedimentation rate were associated with modifications in <b>paleorelief</b> sloping and transport mechanisms from subaerial (?) rock fall at the foot of the cone escarpment to sheet-like debris flow on the slopes, and the replacement by sedimentation under wave and storm influence. The presence of an active carbonate productivity, recorded in the primary porosities of the Boho slope-apron, is suggested by widespread development of a robust, coelobiontic, microbial carbonate factory resilient to poisoning by terrigenous influx. Diagenesis in these deposits includes marine, meteoric and deep-burial cementation of calcite, dolomite, iron oxides, quartz, feldspar, and celestine, the latter indicating precipitation from hypersaline pore fluids...|$|E
40|$|The Alto Tunuyan Foreland Basin {{in western}} Argentina is located {{immediately}} {{south of the}} flat-slab segment of the Central Andes and its evolution {{is directly related to}} the propagation of structures to the east. Petrographic and geochronologic studies have been performed to determine the provenance of syntectonic sediments in the basin in order to establish their relationship to the Andean orogenic activity. The analysed detrital and igneous zircons in contrast with previous data, allow us to restrict the basin age between ca. 15 and 6 Ma. Sandstones record two main contributions, one from andesitic volcanic rocks and the other from an acidic igneous source, the first probably corresponding to Miocene volcanic rocks from the Principal Cordillera (Farellones Formation) and the second to Permo-Triassic, acidic, igneous rocks from the Frontal Cordillera (Choiyoi Magmatic Province, CMP). Two secondary sources have been recorded, sedimentary and metamorphic; the first one is represented by Mesozoic rocks in the Principal Cordillera and the second by the Proterozoic/early Carboniferous Guarguaraz Complex (GC) in the Frontal Cordillera, respectively. Sandstones from the lower basin deposits (15 - 11 Ma) register supply pulses from the Farellones Formation reflecting the unroofing of the Principal Cordillera by uplift pulses during the middle Miocene. Sandstones from the upper basin deposits (ca. 11 - 9 Ma) record an increase in material derived from the CMP, reflecting important uplift of the Frontal Cordillera. A thick, ca. 9 Ma old ignimbrite within the basin indicates an eruption in the Frontal Cordillera. Detrital zircons from the CMP have been detected also in the lower basin deposits, suggesting either recycling of Mesozoic deposits containing CMP zircons or an early <b>paleorelief</b> of the Frontal Cordillera. The good correlation between the age of the detrital zircons of the CMP and the GC in the lower basin deposits supports recycling of Mesozoic sedimentary deposits.

They provide the necessary boundaryconditions for climate and geodynamic modeling, surface processes and biotic interactions. In particular, theopening and closing of ocean gateways {{and the growth of}} major mountain belts are major drivers of climatechanges and biotic interchange. However, the timing and spatial extent of such events are highly controversial andregularly questioned by new data. As part of the ERC “MAGIC” project focusing on Asian Monsoons during theIcehouse to Greenhouse transition we thus produced a set of worldwide Cenozoic paleogeographic maps in theperiod time between 60 to 20 Ma, with a set of boundary conditions specific to the India-Asia collision zone andthe Drake Passage. The creation of a paleogeographic map followed a rigorous and reproductively methodology that integrates paleo-bathymetric, paleoshoreline and paleotopographic data into a coherent plate tectonic model using the open sourcesoftware GPlates. (1) We use the model provided by Seton et al. (2012) as a first order tectonic model modifiedto integrate the full restoration of five regions: the Andes, the Scotia Arc, Africa, The Mediterranean Sea and theTibet-Himalayan collision zone. (2) The paleobathymetry was provided by Müller et al. (2008) using age-depthrelationships and assuming symmetric ridge spreading. (3) Paleoshoreline maps were modified according to thefossil database from fossilworks. org and the geological record and were used to represent the boundary betweenterrestrial and marine paleo-environments. (4) To reconstruct paleoelevations, the most controversial task, wecompiled a wide range of data including stable isotope, leaf physiognomy, and thermochronology combined withregional fossil and geological records (tectonic setting) and geomorphological data. Finally, we use the opensource GMT software and a set of masks to modify the current Earth relief model (ETOPO) according to theestimated paleoelevation for specific region at each period of time. Our approach specifically takes into account the evolution of continental margins. Paleotopographic evolution iscoupled with the evolving shape of continents.

40|$|The Ram Group in Jordan forms part of {{a massive}} and voluminous quartz-rich blanket that covered North Africa and Arabia, the former {{northern}} margin of Gondwana during the Early Paleozoic. The lack of vegetation on the vast peneplained and tectonically stable margin resulted {{in the development of}} extensive alluvial systems markedly different in scale from modern systems. In the Petra area, the Ram Group is conformed by the Salib, Abu Kusheiba and Umm Ishrin formations. Its onset and development are admirably displayed allowing a unique oportunity to perform detailed sedimentological studies. In the paleogeographic context of the Early Paleozoic, the detailed analysis of five lithofacies and interpretation of their three major associations in terms of architectural elements, the study of the mineralogical development throughout the sequence and the ichnofacies content from new ichnofossil discoveries are all gathered in order to reconstruct a depositional and architectural model for the Ram Group. The base of the sequence buries a remarkable 100 -metre high <b>paleorelief</b> of the Precambrian basement inherited from volcanic activity. Upward, the sedimentary package describes a 110 -metre-thick fining/thinning (salib Formation) and coarsening/thickening (Abu Kusheiba Formation) cycle until drastic development of a > 500 -metre-thick, massive, medium-grained cross-bedded quartzarenite (Umm Ishrin Formation). The environments of depositions evolved from shallow marine shelf to delta-front and delta braidplain until definite onset of a continent-wide alluvial plain dominated by shallow, perennial, sand-bed braided rivers on the distal margins of Gondwana. Short-lived transgressions and tidal currents reworked parts of abandoned braidplains. The Umm Ishrin Formation is an excellent analogue for subsurface braided hydrocarbon reservoirs. Reservoir characterization from outcrop studies results in a vertical stack of laterally extensive sheet-like units with remarkable high net-to-gross ratios. Radial flow is expected and drainage would be driven under gravity dominated flow due to good hydraulic connectivity in a rather thick and homogeneous sand-rich formation. Reservoir heterogeneities such as small, isolated fine-grained interbeds are randomly distributed through the reservoir. Rather than impeding cross-vertical flow, these barriers may be useful in preventing water or gas coning when correct placing of production wells.

40|$|The Devonian Dawson Bay Formation {{has been}} divided into the Second Red Bed, Burr, Neely and Hubbard Evaporite members from base to top. The {{purpose of this}} thesis is (1) to {{describe}} the sedimentary rocks of the formation from Saskatchewan and northwestern Manitoba, (2) to interpret the depositional environments and diagenesis, and (3) to discuss {{the implications of the}} new results. The Second Red Bed Member (SRBM) comprises mudstone and dolostone. This study shows that the mudstone was deposited in environments that ranged from saline- and dry-mudflat to distal alluvial-eolian plain, and that the dolostone formed in a Coorong-like environment. New evidence indicates that the SRBM was affected by pedogenesis, with the paleosol better developed in central Saskatchewan than in southeastern Saskatchewan. This suggests that the <b>paleorelief</b> in the former part of the basin was higher than in the latter, and that the marine waters came from the southeast. This conclusion not only has a scientific significance in reconstructing the paleogeography of the Williston Basin, but also sheds light on the future exploration of petroleum and other economic minerals in the basin. Three paleokarst horizons have been recognized in the contact zone between the SRBM and the Burr Member. The presence of the paleokarsts indicates that before the Williston Basin was completely flooded by seawater during early Burr time, two minor marine transgressions took place in the basin. New evidence shows that the lower Burr Member was deposited in an oxygen-restricted environment. In central Saskatchewan, parts of the lower Burr Member contain fine laminations, but the equivalent units in southeastern Saskatchewan lack these laminations. This indicates that the environment in central Saskatchewan was more oxygen-restricted. Thus, from central to southeastern Saskatchewan, the environment became less oxygen-restricted with increasing water depth. This contradicts the Rhoads-Morse-Byers model, which predicts that oxygen decreases with increasing water depth. In southeastern Saskatchewan, the upper Burr Member consists mainly of wackestone and lime mudstone, with a few thin packstone and grainstone interbeds. This reflects a low energy, relatively deep water environment. In contrast, the proportion of packstone and grainstone increases significantly in the upper Burr Member of central Saskatchewan and northwestern Manitoba. This suggests that the depositional environments in those regions had higher energy and shallower water conditions. From base to top, the depositional environment of the Neely Member changed from relatively deep, offshore settings, through higher energy, shallower water conditions represented by domical stromatoporoids, to intertidal and supratidal conditions. The Hubbard Evaporite Member was deposited in salt pan to saline mudflat environment, and the overlying First Red Bed formed in environments that ranged from saline mudflat, dry mudflat to distal floodplain. New evidence also shows that no significant sedimentary break is present between the Hubbard Evaporite Member and the First Red Bed, and that they belong to a single upward-shallowing succession...|$|E

Dune movement took place in relation to arid events; meanwhile, {{the development of the}} dune-wetlands system was linked to wet climatic events. Along the wet climates a raised table water existed, which favored the growing of vegetation and the ralentization or stopping of dunes.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} of the post-Hercynian {{geologic}} history of the South-Central Pyrenees is recorded in a sequence of fluvial and volcanic deposits which reach a total of added maximum thicknesses of more than 2300 m and date from the Westphalian D {{up to and including}} the Lower Triassic. The present study concerns the primary lithology, paleocurrents, depositional environment, paleoclimatology, and diagenesis of these deposits. Five formations are distinguished: (5) Bunter Formation (Lower Triassic) (4) Peranera Formation (Permian) (3) Malpas Formation (Stephanian) (2) Erill Castell Volcanics (Stephanian?) (1) Aguiró Formation (Westphalian D) The deposits of the Aguiró Formation are the fills of fossil valleys forming part of a pronounced <b>paleorelief.</b> The formation consists largely of conglomerates deposited by braided streams. One level, near Aguiró, contains coal-bearing, tuffaceous mudstone and tuff beds, the environment of deposition corresponding to that of a back-swamp. Most clastic components, many of wich are non-calcareous phyllite grains, can be recognized as stemming from the Paleozoic basement (Axial Zone of the Pyrenees, lying to the North of Aguiró). The Erill Castell Volcanics, consisting of silicified and kaolinized andesitic tuffs and one intercalated basaltic andesite sheet, were deposited on a hilly land surface, since they locally overly fossil slope breccia and contain some fluvial channel-fills. The tuffs show evidence of penecontemporaneous pedogenesis. The Malpas Formation contains coal-bearing mudstones and shales, bedded chert, limestones, and ferroan dolomite beds (backswamp and lacustrine environments), sheets of upward-fining sandstones (the fills of mainly meandering streams), and one thick level of conglomerates (braided stream environment). The distribution of these deposits on the geological map still indicates the filling-in of a fossil valley. Nearly all the clastic components in the Malpas Formation stem from the directly underlying Erill Castell Volcanics, which had already been altered by weathering. The Peranera Formation consists of caliche-bearing red beds. Depositional features point to the lowlands bordering alluvial fans. Many of the clastic components are similar to those in the Aguiró Formation, stemming from the Paleozoic basement. The Bunter Formation, which is also composed of red beds, unconformably overlies all other deposits; its lower surface records a period of pediplanation. The Bunter sandstones consist mainly of quartz; they are the most mature in the entire sequence. The Peranera depositional environment was comparable to that of the present-day steppes, the Bunter environment to that of savannahs. All fluvial deposits show paleocurrent directions indicating flow from either the West, the North, or the East. The paleoclimate was of paramount importance for the primary lithology, depositional characteristics, and diagenesis of the deposits. Humid conditions would account for the deduced continuous flow during the deposition of the Malpas Formation and flooded back-swamps of the Aguiró and Malpas formations. In these formations, diagenetic parageneses of iron sulfides, kaolinite, and siderite, and the preservation of abundant vegetational debris, point to a weakly to strongly reducing and a neutral to acid milieu. A semi-arid climate is consistent with the intermittent flow deduced from channel-fill properties in the Peranera Formation. Flow in the Bunter channels was more continuous, but the channels dried up in the dry seasons. The instability of the vegetational debris in both formations (root traces are present but there is hardly any coalified material) points to lowered water-tables and the oxidizing conditions of sub-aerial diagenesis. In spite of the similarity represented by a greyish-red stain, the Peranera and Bunter red beds differ strongly in primary lithology and diagenesis. The clastic composition of the Peranera Formation is to a great extent unstable; in the Bunter Formation it is highly stable; ferric oxides in the Peranera sandstones were largely brought in clastically; in the Bunter sandstones they are authigenic. Diagenesis in the Peranera deposits is mainly that of precipitation of and replacement by calcite (caliche); in the Bunter deposits in situ kaolinization of muscovite, possibly early diagenetic quartz (silcrete?), and authigenesis of dolomite can be observed. These differences are probably related in part to the morphologic setting (Peranera Formation: still some relief; Bunter Formation: deposits directly overlying wide pediments), but chiefly to the paleoclimate (Peranera Formation: steppe climate; Bunter Formation: savannah climate). The composition of recent fluvial sands deriving from the Paleozoic core of the Pyrenees is treated in an Appendix. These sands are to a large extent comparable to the sandstones in the Aguiró and Peranera Formations...|$|E

In this area the mineral deposit of Invicta comprises i) the generation of the last pulse of calc-alkaline intrusions of the Coastal Batholith with ages around 30 million years. The initial phase of the batholith magmatism generative dates and related to compressive orogenic movements of the Peruvian phase occurred in upper Cretaceous with ages approximately 100 million years. ii) Generation of the volcanic rocks of Calipuy formation with ages somewhat lower than the pulses of hydrothermal solutions generated by the intrusive. Apparently the final pulses of the Batholith and the Calipuy volcanic was driven by movements of compressive deformation of the Inca phase during the lower to middle tertiary. iii) Finally the generation of hydrothermal fluids from the residual solutions rich in silica and metal ions, originated in the last intrusional pulses of the Batholith, and they originated the mineralization in mineral deposit of Invicta. 	The fluid inclusion study shows three populations of mineralizing fluids recognized by different temperature ranging from 150 to 450 ºC and salinities ranging from 0 to 21 % eq. NaCl, which has allowed an overlay of events with mineral interest. This fact, together with favorable host igneous lithology and faulting systems as channels gatherer for the deposition of mineralizing fluids, have encouraged the formation of this mineral deposit. 	Invicta is tentatively classified as a Cordillerano mineral deposit type, of epigenetic origin mainly mesothermal to epithermal range. The Wilkinson diagram of salinity vs. homogenization shows a complex distribution of mineralization in this mineral deposit, which falls mainly in the mesothermal field with gradations to epithermal field. 10 	The column previously recognized with economic mineralization in Atenea Vein is 600 m; with a <b>paleorelief</b> would be about 400 m above the present surface, making a total column of 1000 m. in the vertical. This fact and the different phase of mineralization superimposed with different degrees of temperature and salinity, open up important exploratory opportunities in depth, in Atenea vein mainly towards the southwest {{as well as in}} other veins, which will be pointing to the continuation of detailed investigations in the laboratory and confirmed by exploration with diamond drilling and other complementary studies.

En esta área el yacimiento Invicta, comprende i) la generación de las últimas pulsaciones de los intrusivos calcoalcalinos del Batolito de la Costa, con edades de alrededor de los 30 millones de años. La etapa inicial generativa del magmatismo del batolito, se remonta y relaciona con los movimientos compresivos orogénicos de la fase peruana ocurridos en el Cretácico superior con edades de aproximadamente de 100 millones de años. ii) la generación de las rocas volcánicas de la formación Calipuy, con edades algo menores a los pulsos de las soluciones hidrotermales generadas por los intrusivos. Aparentemente los pulsos magmáticos finales del batolito y de los volcánicos Calipuy, fueron impulsados por los movimientos de deformación compresiva de la fase Incaica durante el Terciario inferior a medio; iii) finalmente la generación de los fluidos hidrotermales a partir de las soluciones residuales ricas en iones metálicos y sílice, originadas en los últimos pulsos intrusionales del batolito, produjeron la mineralización del yacimiento Invicta. 	El estudio de inclusiones fluidas, muestra tres poblaciones de fluidos mineralizantes reconocidas por los distintos grados de temperatura que van desde los 150 a 450 ºC y salinidades que van de 0 a 21 % eq. peso NaCl, lo cual ha permitido una superposición de eventos con mineral de interés.

Aus dem regionalen Yergleich geht hervor, dass in diesel' Zeit das Floresta-Massiv eine Hebungstendenz zeigte, die zur Erosion oder Nichtakkumulation del' anderen aus dem nordlich angrenzenden Santander-Massiv bekannten Einheiten vom Jungpalaozoikum bis Trias-Jura fiihrte. Daher haben die Boyaca- und Soapaga-Yerwerfen, die das Floresta-Massiv lateral begrenzen,  in palaozoischer Zeit wohl eine wichtige tektonisch-sedimentare Rolle gespielt. Field {{observations}} {{carried on}} during {{the last six years}} and the findings of fossils (mainly plant remains, ostracodes, branchiopodes, inarticulated brachiopodes, fish scales and bivalves) in the Cuche Formation provide new information on the geology of the Floresta region.   Consequently, it has been possible to determine that the sedimentary sequence constitued by EI Tibet, Floresta and Cuche Formations belongs to a single depositional cycle truncated at the top, and mainly developed during devonian times. This cycle rests on a paleotopography developed on an igneous-metamorphic basemente constitued by cambro-ordovician (or older) phyllites and schists, correlated with the Silgará Formation of the Santander Massif. This basement has been by pre and postdevonian prejurassic quartzose syenites and granites.   In the same way, field work confirms that the Floresta/Cuche contact (as pointed by Olsson & Caster, 1939) is a concordant-transitional one. The abundant fossiliferous content of the Floresta Formation indicates a Middle Devonian age for it.   As shown by preliminary identifications, the flora and fauna from the Cuche Formation, restricted to four levels, suggest a Middle Devonian to ?Lower Missisipian age.   The sedimentary enviroment deduced from the litofacies and biofacies of the Cuche Formation is that of a predominantly emerged platform subjected to some ingressions of the sea.   The Cuche Formation is unconformely overlaid by the Upper Jurassic Girón Formation (red beds of continental origin); consequently, rocks of Missisipian to Middle Jurassic age are missing.   Regional comparison shows that during this interval the Floresta Massif was a positive feature, leading to erosion or lack of accumulation of upper paleozoic to triassic-jurassic units outcropping at neighboring Santander Massif.   Thus, the Boyacá and Soapaga Faults, lateral boundaries of the Floresta Massif, seem to have been a significant factor controlling the tecto-sedimentary processes since paleozoic times. Observaciones de campo realizadas en los últimos seis años, y el hallazgo de restos fósiles en diferentes niveles de la Fm. Cuche, han aportado nuevos datos sobre la geología de los alrededores de Floresta. Así, se ha podido determinar que la secuencia sedimentaria integrada por las Formaciones El Tibet, Floresta y Cuche, corresponde a un solo ciclo de sedimentación, ocurrido esencialmente durante el Devoniano. Dicho ciclo recubre una paleotopografía desarrollada sobre un basamento ígneo-metamórfico, constituido por esquistos y filitas del cambro-ordoviciano (o más antiguas), comparables con la Fm. Silgará del Macizo de Santander, e intruidas por granitos y sienitas cuarzosas pre y postdevonianos. El paleorrelieve recubierto por la unidad basal del Devoniano, se refleja en los bruscos cambios de espesor de la Fm. El Tibet, que en tramos cortos pasa de aproximadamente 500 m. (area tipo; Cerro del Tibet) a 10 · 5 m. de espesor (región al E de Floresta).   Las relaciones de campo permiten así mismo corroborar que el límite Fm. Floresta- Fm. Cuche es concordante y transicional. EI abundante contenido fósil de la Fm. Floresta indica el Devoniano Medio, en tanto que el de la Fm. Cuche, más esporádico, señala, de acuerdo con las determinaciones preliminares, un intervalo entre el Devoniano Medio y el ?Carboniano Inicial.   La lito y la biofacies de la Fm. Cuche sugieren un ambiente sedimentario de regresión lenta, sometido a momentos de emersión e ingresiones cortas del mar.   La Fm. Girón (Jurásico Superior), constituída por capas rojas de origen continental, recubre en discordancia angular a la Fm. Cuche, reflejando así un importante faltante del registro litológico, correspondiente al lapso Carboniano-Jurásico Medio.   De la comparación regional se deriva que durante dicho lapso el Macizo de Floresta experimentó una tendencia que condujo a la erosión o no acumulación de otras unidades del Paleozoico Superior y del Triáico-Jurásico conocidas un poco al N, en el colindante Macizo de Santander. Así, las Fallas de Boyacá y Soapaga, que limitan lateralmente el Macizo de Floresta, parecen haber jugado un importante control tecto-sedimentario, desde tiempos paleozoicos.   </p...|$|E
40|$|A Las estructuras de deformación (ED) en sedimentos blandos comprenden las alteraciones que se producen casi simultáneamente con la sedimentación. Estos procesos se hallan en relación directa con las características internas de los materiales sedimentarios y de los factores externos que actúan sobre ellos. Sus resultados incluyen deformaciones como inyecciones, fracturas, volcanes y laminaciones convolutas que afectan total o parcialmente la estratificación. Los sedimentos blandos deformados por sismos se incluyen bajo la denominación general de sismitas (seismites). Como objetivo de esta investigación se plantea reconocer, por primera vez, estructuras de deformación ubicadas en la Formación Río Negro presentes en el sector norte del Golfo San Matías, en inmediaciones del Faro Río Negro. La metodología empleada consistió en el reconocimiento y descripción de las estructuras, para lo cual se extrajeron muestras para determinar granulometría, mineralogía y contenido de materia orgánica. Se fotografiaron los distintos sectores con deformaciones con el fin de establecer modelos comparativos. El sector estudiado, de 4 km de extensión, se ubica entre el faro de Río Negro y el inicio del Banco Verde y morfológicamente corresponde a un frente acantilado con orientación ENE-OSO. En él se determinaron las siguientes ED: a- de carga simple, pseudonódulos contiguos y aislados, y estructuras complejas; b- de escape de fluidos y c- estructuras de deslizamiento basal y por presión dirigida. El origen de las deformaciones se debe a las características de las sedimentitas y a los procesos que las afectan tales como los efectos por carga, escapes de fluidos y las presiones dirigidas. Como origen de estos procesos se señalan: la presión de la columna litológica, las olas de tormentas y los terremotos. Por los rasgos hallados las deformaciones del litoral rionegrino tendrían un origen sísmico, proceso ocurrido en un único evento durante el ciclo Andino cuyos inicios se fijan hace aproximadamente 45 Ma. Por otra parte sus techos y bases no se hallan asociados a otros procesos de deformación y sus espesores no exceden el metro de potencia. Además se hallan acotadas a la zona de transición entre los miembros medio y {{superior}} de la Formación Río Negro descansando en algunos casos sobre arcilitas y en otros sobre limolitas, originadas en un paleorelieve de interdunas. Soft-sediment deformation structures (SSD) are alterations produced almost {{simultaneously with}} sedimentation. They {{are directly related}} to internal characteristics of sedimentary materials as well as to external factors acting on them. Results derived from such alterations are evidenced as injections, fractures, volcanoes and convolute laminations, among other forms, affecting stratification either totally or partially. Soft-sediment deformation structures resulting from seisms are known as seismites. The present study aims at determining {{for the first time the}} presence of SSD structures in the Río Negro Formation, located in the northern area of San Matías Gulf, near Río Negro Lighthouse, Argentina (Fig. 1). To this end, structures were firstly identified and further described. Samples were subsequently collected for the determination of grain-size, mineralogy and organic matter content. Photographs of the different sectors evidencing deformations were taken in order to determine further comparative models. Morphology in the study area is associated to cliffs with vertical, fractured fronts and with an average height of 70 m in whose base torn-down blocks are accumulated. The geological structure of the study area is related to the Cuenca del Colorado and the Comarca Nordpatagónica, whose basement is mainly composed of Paleozoic and Mesozoic crystalline rocks. The sedimentary tertiary cover from the Miocene-Pliocene is represented by light-blue sandstones of the Río Negro Formation (Andreis, 1965). This unit was formed in an aeolian environment with intercalations of clay-silt shallow lagoons and a marine episode located in the mid area of the Río Negro Formation. At the top of the Río Negro Formation there are Pleistocene-Holocene sedimentites having a thickness of up to 5 m. Within the local structural framework of our study area there are fractures with a NE-SW and a NW-SE direction, which are related with fractures N 55 º, N 90 º and N 350 º azimuth located in the abrasion platform. According to Dzulinsky and Walton (1965), Lowe (1975), Brencley and Newall (1977), Clauss (1993), van Loon (2002), Owen (2003), Neuwerth et al. (2006), Alfaro et al. (2006), Montenat et al. (2007), among others (Table 1), and, taking into account the geometry of deformations, laboratory reconstructions and field observations from our study area, it can be concluded that the classifications of SSD structures tend to establish morphologic and genetic systematizations. The following characteristics were identified in our study area: limited deformations among stratigraphic horizons; a lateral continuity of SSD structures at considerable distances; and a confinement between non-deformed strata and its lithological association with psamitic-pelitic sediments. The study area, which is 4 km long and is located between Río Negro Lighthouse and the beginning of Banco Verde, is from the morphological point of view, a cliffed front with an ENE-WSW orientation. Different types of SSD structures were identified in this area. For example, from the morphological point of view and according to the loading mechanisms observed, simple-load structures (Fig. 2), attached and detached pseudonodules (Figs. 3, 4 and 5) and complex structures (Fig. 6) were identified. Furthermore, from the genetic point of view and according to the intrusion processes observed in soft sediments, water-scape structures (Fig. 7) and plate- or fountain-like deformations (Fig. 8) were found. From the genetic point of view, and based on the collapse and pressure mechanisms observed, basal slumping (Fig. 9) and directed-pressure structures (Fig. 11) were also found. The above-mentioned SSD structures were analyzed and interpreted following Strachan´s model (2002) (Fig. 10) and Laird´s model (1968) (Fig. 12). The origin of SSD structures depends on the characteristics of sedimentites and on the mechanisms that produce them. In the study area, the materials susceptible to deformation come from an interdune environment that is characterized by granulometric variations derived from the fluctuating and restrictive climatic conditions (Cojan and Thiry, 1992) that typify the Río Negro Formation. Fine-grained materials having low cohesion and poor sorting such as the sediments of deformed strata (Fig. 13) produced SSD structures as a result of high pore pressure and liquefaction effects (Tsuchida and Hayashi, 1971; Obermeier, 1996). Grain packing with a porous value as that allows intercommunication among grains and saturated material, is also crucial to the formation of SSD structures. The mineralogic content of deformed levels is composed of i) quartz, chalcedony, orthose, plagioclase, pyroxenes and biotite, opaques (magnetite and ilmenite, autigenic pyrite) in crystalline aggregates; ii) undetermined Fe oxides; and iii) colorless and light-brown unaltered volcanic glass shards, clays identified as smectite-illite interstratified and scarce kaolinite. Grains are mainly subangular and, to a lesser extent, sub-round and round. The surface of the majority of grains in the study area was found clean and with some marks. The percentage of CaCO 3 was found to vary from 0. 5 to 3 % and that of total organic carbon (TOC) was found to reach 1. 5 %. Deformations may be produced as a result of load deformation mechanisms, fluid escape, basal slumping or pressure-directed displacements. Due to load deformation mechanisms, structures are linked to gravity-related movements occurring during the initial stages of deposition. For these deformations to occur, grain-size at the overlaying levels should be thicker than at the underlying levels, for example, sandstones rather than silstones or claystones. These deformations are related to water saturation at the deformed level (fluidization-liquefaction). Therefore, deformation mechanisms, which involve both expulsion and rotation of fragments as well as fluid escape, are characterized by the action of lithostatic pressure which produces movement (deformation) and by the action of the underlying sedimentary levels. Deformations may also result from a fluid escape mechanism, i. e., from a mechanism associated to i) the spatial arrangement of grains (packing), ii) their shape, iii) their tendency to inequigranularity, and iv) the communication among macro- and micro- pores as well as the high or low sinuosity connection among themselves (Net and Limarino, 2000). Further requirements for deformations to occur include particular thixotrophic conditions, especially the presence of colloids among grains. The rupture of unions of particles either by hitting or by shearing is, among others, a cause which produces an unbalance between hydrostatic pressure and lithostatic pressure. If the latter is altered, the energetic unbalance makes fine sediments flow among the weakly lithified sandstones whose extrusion will occur via both vertical and horizontal pore ducts (Lopez Gamundi, 1986; Clauss, 1993). Basal slumping produces deformations that are associated not only to soft sediments deposited in natural slopes but also to interbedded sand- and mud-levels. Layers tend to have a prismatic-shaped geometry whose materials are under ductile-to-fragile conditions, in which antique layers support younger ones. Once horizontality is affected, movement, which is marked by a rupture of the original slope, begins. The lower levels are expected to transport the upper ones without affecting the original succession of layers. At the delay of movement derived from the compressive effect of the displacement front, fluids extrude forming cones or cut dikes (Fig. 10). Several deformations of this type initiate movement as result of differences in the hydrostatic gradient (Strachan, 2002). Deformations may be also produced as a result of pressure-directed displacements which are conditioned by the compaction level, thickness and ability of materials to deform. Thus, deformations occur because the original level is saturated in water as a result of the ductile behavior of materials (Bracco et al., 2005). Laird (1968) claims that SSD structures should meet some of the following requirements to be considered of seismic origin: slightly curved strata walls and floors to follow the original stratification and interruption of continuity of the stratum that is marked by a scar in which the sedimentary fillings keep their characteristics both above and below stratification. There could be rotated sediment clasts below the discontinuity as a result of a thrust-induced drag of the upper sedimentary packing. These processes could be, in turn, triggered either by the charge or pressure of the lithologic column, storm waves and seismicity. Storm-wave impact may also produce deformation in soft sediments. Nonetheless, no high energy structures such as cross-beddings or tsunami-type chaotic sedimentation were observed in our study area. Noteworthingly, for stormwave-derived liquefaction to occur, waves should reach magnitudes higher than 6 m (Alfaro et al., 2002), this being a phenomenon that was not recorded in our study area. Taken together, findings from the present study indicate that SSD structures in our study area are seismic alterations that occurred in an event during the Andean cycle whose beginnings are traced approximately 45 My ago. The fact that i) both the roofs and bottoms of these structures are not associated to other processes of deformation, ii) their thickness does not exceed one meter, and iii) they are confined to a transitional area between the middle and top members of the Río Negro Formation, lying in some cases on claystones and in some other cases, on siltstones, originated in an interdune <b>paleorelief,</b> confirms their seismic origin...|$|E
