50|$|Homebrew {{programs}} {{can be used to}} play patched backups of original PS2 DVD games on unmodified consoles, and to install retail discs to an <b>installed</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> on older models (ESR, HD Loader, HD Advance, Open PS2 Loader).|$|R
50|$|Using homebrew programs, it is {{possible}} to play various audio and video file formats on a PS2. Homebrew programs {{can also be used to}} play patched backups of original PS2 DVD games on unmodified consoles, and to install retail discs to an <b>installed</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> on older models. Homebrew emulators of older computer and gaming systems have been developed for the PS2.|$|R
50|$|The Commodore D9090 Hard Disk was {{the only}} family of <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> that Commodore made for both the home and {{business}} market. The electronics are identical in the D9090 and the D9060 unit; {{the only difference is}} the size of the <b>installed</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive,</b> with a jumper set to distinguish between 4 or 6 disk heads. Originally intended for the metal-cased PET series of computers, they were also usable with the Commodore 64 and later models with an adapter.|$|R

5000|$|Component modding: This type of modding, as {{the name}} suggests, {{involves}} modifying the PC components themselves for a perceived improvement in appearance. An example is the relocation of buttons on optical drives. This is often done in combination with [...] "stealthing", which hides the drive's visibility by masking it with a blank face. A riskier modification is <b>installing</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> windows which show the platters and mechanism, which must {{be done in a}} clean room without significant dust. Few people have attempted it and results seem to vary. [...] Some <b>hard</b> <b>drives,</b> including the WD Raptor, now come with a window as standard.|$|R
5000|$|To {{function}} as a [...] "Live Distro" [...] with the option to <b>install</b> to a <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Application {{restrictions}} - allows {{administrators to}} block or allow {{the execution of}} programs <b>installed</b> on the <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> Implemented using Windows Software Restriction Policies.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the name}} {{suggests}} otherwise, Elive works best <b>installed</b> on the <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> rather than {{used as a}} live distro, so it's claimed {{to be good for}} a daily used basis.|$|R
50|$|This runs {{as though}} Dream is <b>installed</b> onto the <b>hard</b> <b>drive,</b> and saves any changes to {{configuration}} that are made. It is only recommended {{for use on}} USB drives that are 2 GB.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the more}} {{intriguing}} features of Slax-based distributions, is {{how easy it is}} to convert the live OS into a full-fledged Linux system <b>installed</b> on the <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> of any PC, which will take up roughly 3.5GBytes of space.|$|R
50|$|The Amiga port was {{developed}} by Sterling Games. The Amiga version did not include all {{the features of the}} PC version, including the Scottish League, international management, player histories and backgrounds). Furthermore, it could not be <b>installed</b> to a <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|R
50|$|Among the MacBook and MacBook Pro {{community}} {{there have}} been several owners who <b>installed</b> aftermarket <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> already equipped with anti-shock features who reported experiencing kernel panic errors whenever their unit was physically moved. This is believed to be due to a conflict between SMS and the new drive's anti-shock function. The Western Digital Scorpio series of notebook <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> have been the most frequently reported as being susceptible to this problem. In practically all cases, disabling SMS alleviated this problem without any negative performance impact.|$|R
5000|$|The {{distribution}} produces two Live CD ISO images. The larger, codenamed [...] "Acorn", is a 200 MB ISO image. The other, [...] "Droplet", is a 150 MB ISO image. Both can be <b>installed</b> onto a <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> or a USB flash drive.|$|R
50|$|Dreamlinux was a Brazilian {{computer}} {{operating system}} based on Debian GNU/Linux. It can boot as a live CD, from USB flash drive, or can be <b>installed</b> on a <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> The distribution's GUI aims to have a centered animated toolbar. As of October 2012, The Dreamlinux Project has been discontinued.|$|R
50|$|Windows Recovery Environment {{can also}} be <b>installed</b> to a <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> {{partition}} by OEMs, and customized with additional tools such as a separate system recovery tool for restoring the computer back to its original state. As of Windows Vista SP1, users can create their own bootable CD containing the recovery environment.|$|R
50|$|The Quantum Bigfoot brand was {{a series}} of <b>hard</b> disk <b>drives</b> {{produced}} by Quantum Corp. from 1996 through the late 1990s. The Bigfoot series was notable for deviating from the standard form factor for <b>hard</b> <b>drives.</b> While most desktop <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> at that time used a 3.5-inch physical format, Quantum Bigfoot drives used a larger 5.25-inch form factor more commonly seen in older <b>hard</b> <b>drives,</b> CD-ROM and other optical disc drives. This form factor allowed Quantum to increase the capacity of their <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> without an increase in data density, thus lowering costs compared to a 3.5-inch drive with the same capacity. It also allowed manufacturers and owners to <b>install</b> the <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> above or below the optical drive in the computer, as the typical computer had multiple 5.25-inch bays.|$|R
50|$|Historically, Macs {{were not}} {{designed}} to be taken apart. Ever since the original closed-box Macintosh in 1984, Apple has always preferred that upgrades take place outside the case. While PC users would open up their computer to <b>install</b> a second <b>hard</b> <b>drive,</b> Mac users would simply plug an external <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> into their computer; this adds slight cost and the external <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> performs more slowly, but is easier for the average user to perform.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, it was ported to Amiga and Mega Drive/Genesis. The Amiga {{floppy disk}} port is nearly {{identical}} in interface and game {{play to the}} PC version, albeit with less detailed graphics and frequent disk swapping (the game came on five disks). Save games are stored on a specially formatted disk and the game could also be <b>installed</b> to <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> In the Amiga version the player is limited to 32 units, but patches exist to allow the DOS version to have 255 units created and managed.|$|R
50|$|On June 14, 2010, during E3, Microsoft {{revealed}} {{their new}} Xbox 360 console {{referred to as}} the Xbox 360 S or Slim. Microsoft made the unit smaller and quieter, while also <b>installing</b> a 250GB <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> and built-in 802.11n WiFi. It started shipping to US stores the same day, not reaching Europe until July 13.|$|R
50|$|Porteus {{is based}} on a {{substantially}} modified and optimized version of the Linux Live Scripts. It can be run from a disk or USB stick (with changes saved onto the portable device) or <b>installed</b> on a <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> Porteus can even be installed within another system without the need to create a new partition.|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} MEPIS {{distribution}} was SimplyMEPIS, {{which was based}} primarily on Debian stable, with the last version of SimplyMEPIS being based on Debian 6. It could either be <b>installed</b> onto a <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> or used as a Live DVD, which made it externally bootable for troubleshooting and repairing many operating systems. It included the KDE desktop environment.|$|R
50|$|The modular {{kernel of}} Whitix is {{licensed}} under the GNU General Public License, {{and is a}} fully preemptive multitasking kernel with multithreading. It supports a number of filesystems, including the FAT family of filesystems, ext3 (with journaling), Reiserfs and ISO9660. Whitix is available as a live CD for download, and can be <b>installed</b> to the <b>hard</b> <b>drive,</b> beginning with version 0.2.|$|R
5|$|Xbox One {{games are}} {{distributed}} at retail on Blu-ray Disc, and digitally as downloads through Xbox Games Store. All Xbox One games must be installed to the console's storage: users {{can begin to}} play portions of a game (such as opening levels) once the installation or download reaches a specific point, while {{the remainder of the}} game is downloaded or installed in the background. Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby. If the game is installed from physical media, the disc is still required for validation purposes. If the game is installed on another console, and that console owner no longer has access to the disc, the owner has the option of unlocking the <b>install</b> on their <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> by purchasing it through Xbox Live; the installed game then acts as a game <b>installed</b> on the <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> An active internet connection may be required for some games, particularly those that rely on server-side processing..|$|R
50|$|By {{allowing}} {{users to}} bring their own operating system there are significant cost savings {{to be made by}} organisations who commonly have many on-site users and are obliged to provide them with computer hardware to allow them to perform specific tasks as {{there is no longer a}} need to <b>install</b> a <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> in each computer. Upgrading and maintaining many PC computers has also become easier as companies only need to supply users with new pen drives containing the operating system boot images rather than having to re-image every PC with the latest build of the operating system thus eliminating upgrade costs.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Supermicro 5016T-MTFB (1U server). CPU {{and memory}} slots are empty; also {{contains}} one (topmost) dummy fan {{that can be}} replaced by functional fan if required. While blue SATA cables to <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> are <b>installed</b> (top edge), <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> themselves are not included. The available PCI-Express slot (riser card in the middle) is also empty. Includes motherboard, CD-ROM and power supply (bottom). Old PCI slot is still present on the motherboard but requires separately sold riser card to be reachable.|$|R
50|$|Starting {{with the}} Tandy 1000 TL/2, XT IDE {{controllers}} were integrated onto the motherboard. However, these {{were unable to}} support common AT IDE <b>hard</b> <b>drives.</b> The TL/2, TL/3, RL and RLX all used the XT IDE interface, where the later (and significantly upgraded) RSX {{was the first and}} only Tandy 1000 model computer to use a standard AT IDE interface. One option for contemporary users of these systems would be to install and use XT ISA CompactFlash adapters, which may be less expensive to acquire than vintage MFM/RLL or XT IDE <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> and, potentially, the brackets needed to support them. This is also the most practical way to <b>install</b> a <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> into a Tandy 1000 EX or HX, using an adapter cable that adapts the male PLUS-style connector to an 8-bit ISA card-edge slot.|$|R
50|$|Black Crypt was {{available}} on the Amiga, and came on three 880k disks (excluding a game-save disk, used if not <b>installed</b> on a <b>hard</b> <b>drive).</b> The graphics mode used was called Extra Half-Bright, which allowed for a user defined palette of thirty-two colours, {{as well as an}} additional thirty-two colours which were half the brightness of the chosen palette, allowing for the games gloomy atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|Body Blows is {{compatible}} with Amiga 500, 500+, 600, 1200, 2000, 3000, 4000, and CDTV systems. It requires at least 1MB of RAM and can utilise extra memory that's installed on the system. It has four channel stereo music, speech and sound effects. The game features full PAL screen scrolling at 50 Hz and 32 colour graphics. It cannot be <b>installed</b> to a <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|R
50|$|GeeXboX {{is a free}} Linux {{distribution}} {{providing a}} media center software suite for personal computers. GeeXboX 2.0 and later uses XBMC for media playback and is implemented as Live USB and Live CD options. As such, the system {{does not need to}} be permanently <b>installed</b> to a <b>hard</b> <b>drive,</b> as most modern operating systems would. Instead, the computer can be booted with the GeeXboX CD when media playback is desired.|$|R
50|$|The Live Editions are {{bootable}} CDROMs {{which contain}} the VectorLinux operating {{system on the}} CD. This enables the user to test a distribution on a system without the need of re-partitioning and <b>installing</b> to the <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> It is also possible to install VectorLinux from the Live Edition CD. VectorLinux presently has two Live Editions: Standard and SOHO. The latest edition is {{a preview of the}} Deluxe Edition.|$|R
5000|$|The Amiga {{version is}} spread across three 3.5" [...] floppy disks in {{original}} protected form (disks are RobNorthen PDOS protected, each one using longtracks with 12 sectors per track and 980 KB per disk), while the cracked version in the amigaDOS disk standard is spread over four disks. Once <b>installed</b> on a <b>hard</b> <b>drive,</b> either in ECS or AGA version, the executable checks {{from where the}} game is launched, and if it detects a launch from the <b>hard</b> <b>drive,</b> it will ask for the original Disk 1 (this is the copy protection when installed).|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} hackers have {{attempted}} to upgrade the Sky+ receiver, primarily through the installation of larger <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> to increase recording capacity; instruction manuals and tool kits to do this are widely available. <b>Installing</b> a larger <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> in the unit is no harder than in a normal PC, but the Sky+ receiver is sensitive {{to the type of}} disk installed. Disks with low power requirements and fast spin up times {{are most likely to be}} compatible. <b>Hard</b> <b>drives</b> (consumer electronics drives) designed specifically by manufacturers for use with PVRs provide a considerably lower noise level and produce significantly less heat, reducing the need for internal fans to operate as frequently and again cutting down on noise generation.|$|R

50|$|Instant WebKiosk, is a live {{operating}} system for PCs and Macs designed for web kiosks. The browser (defaults to Google Chromium) {{is locked in}} full-screen mode. Users may change settings but after a reset (typically at end of session) the {{operating system}} defaults to the originally defined values. The operating system is designed to boot from USB flash devices, but may optionally be <b>installed</b> to a <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> Network access is via wired or wireless networks. All system configuration is done via a web interface.|$|R
50|$|Zenwalk Standard is a {{distribution}} aimed at mainstream desktop and development use. Designed to be a stand-alone operating system, it <b>installs</b> to the <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> {{by way of}} a ncurses-based installer. It includes all of the officially released software packages that are deemed most useful by the Zenwalk community. The default install also includes development packages like gcc, and some proprietary media packages (such as Adobe Flash Player) and drivers in order to provide a full featured default install. The default desktop environment is Xfce.|$|R
25|$|A {{new release}} of Wikipedia content was {{published}} by Directmedia on 6 April 2005. This package consisted of a 2.7 GB DVD and a separate bootable CDROM (running a version of Linux with Firefox). The CDROM did not contain all the data, but was included to accommodate users without DVD-drives. The DVD used Directmedia's Digibib software and article format; everything could be <b>installed</b> to a <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> In addition, the DVD contained an HTML tree, as well as Wikipedia articles formatted for use with PDAs (specifically, the Mobipocket and TomeRaider formats).|$|R
