Surface sterilized seeds of all the four selected plant species were raised in a mixture of sterilized soil and sand in 3 : 1 ratio. Mass production of AM fungi was observed in terms of (%) AM colonization, AM spore population, and effectiveness of AM consortia was recorded in terms of height and dry weight of inoculated and uninoculated plants. Out of four test species H. vulgare responded as the most suitable host. After 60 days, H. vulgare showed the highest colonization (92 %) and 74 spores per 25 g soil. It was observed that plants having higher AM colonization showed higher AM spore production showing a positive correlation, however, it was not found in T. aestivum.

40|$|This work {{explores the}} {{hypothesis}} that functionalized biomass-derived chars (charcoal) can act as fertilizer-delivering, carbon-sequestering soil amendments. A naturally occurring precedent for this approach is based on recent results that clearly link increased soil productivity with charcoal-like Terra Preta deposits, which are characterized by enhanced microbial and fungal activity and are found in both temperate and tropical climates. In this work, peanut shell pellets were pyrolyzed under mild conditions (400 C). The resulting char retained nitrogen from the feedstock’s high protein content. This char also provided the baseline material for further nutrient addition by reaction of pyrolysis oil with urea to add more bioavailable nitrogen. Replicated plant growth tests with corn conducted in a controlled greenhouse environment showed that these biomass-derived chars, as produced (raw) and chemically reacted (functionalized) with urea and pyrolysis oil, enhanced above and below ground plant growth similar to the periodic addition of an aqueous NPK fertilizer to the <b>potting</b> <b>soil</b> used for <b>all</b> experiments. We also found that char (raw and functionalized) addition to soil significantly enhanced root growth and that char could support the growth and subsequent release of nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Azotobacter vinelandii) into soils.

Using Arabidopsis thaliana Col- 0 -Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS 417 r as a model system, we investigated the performance and the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-mediated effects of rhizobacteria on the generalist caterpillar Mamestra brassicae and the specialist Pieris brassicae. Rhizobacteria colonisation of Arabidopsis roots resulted in decreased larval weight of M. brassicae, whereas no effect was observed on larval weight of P. brassicae. Using a jasmonic acid (JA) -impaired mutant (dde 2 - 2), we confirmed the importance of JA in rhizobacteria-mediated ISR against M. brassicae.

The tillage systems consisted of either a conventional practice with mouldboard ploughing (28 cm-depth) or a conservation practice with superficial tillage (< 12 cm-depth). The management of the fallowperiod involved either a cover crop sown after maize or bare soil. Water drainage and isoxaflutole and its active diketonitrile metabolite leaching were determined under the four cropping systems using fibreglass wick lysimeters installed at 40 cm-depth. Isoxaflutole was rapidly degraded (half-lives < 2. 1 days) in <b>soil</b> for <b>all</b> <b>cropping</b> systems and years and its leaching was limited (< 1 % of applied dose).
