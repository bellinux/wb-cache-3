40|$|Abstract Background Iron {{deficiency}} (ID) {{results in}} ventricular hypertrophy, believed to involve sympathetic stimulation. We hypothesized that with ID 1) intravenous norepinephrine would alter heart rate (HR) and contractility, 2) abdominal aorta would be {{larger and more}} distensible, and 3) the beta-blocker <b>propanolol</b> would reduce hypertrophy. Methods 1) 30 CD rats were fed an ID or replete diet for 1 week or 1 month. Norepinephrine was infused via jugular vein; pressure was monitored at carotid artery. Saline infusions were used as a control. The pressure trace was analyzed for HR, contractility, systolic and diastolic pressures. 2) Abdominal aorta catheters inflated the aorta, while digital microscopic images were recorded at stepwise pressures to measure arterial diameter and distensibility. 3) An additional 10 rats (5 ID, 5 control) were given a daily injection of <b>propanolol</b> or saline. After 1 month, the hearts were excised and weighed. Results Enhanced contractility, but not HR, was associated with ID hypertrophic hearts. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were consistent {{with an increase in}} arterial diameter associated with ID. Aortic diameter at 100 mmHg and distensibility were increased with ID. <b>Propanolol</b> was associated with an increase in heart to body mass ratio. Conclusions ID cardiac hypertrophy results in an increased inotropic, but not chronotropic response to the sympathetic neurotransmitter, norepinephrine. Increased aortic diameter is consistent with a flow-dependent vascular remodeling; increased distensibility may reflect decreased vascular collagen content. The failure of <b>propanolol</b> to prevent hypertrophy suggests that ID hypertrophy is not mediated via beta-adrenergic neurotransmission. </p...|$|E

Case Report: We report a case of circumscribed choroidal hemangioma (CCH) in a 59 -year-old man refractory to laser treatment. Visual acuity was 20 / 200 and a serous macular detachment was present. The CCH was treated with oral <b>propanolol,</b> whereupon visual acuity improved to 20 / 20 and the macular detachment resolved without systemic or local adverse effects. Discussion: <b>Propanolol</b> is a β-blocker commonly used in cardiology that may induce endothelium vasoconstriction and inhibit endothelial proliferation.

40|$|Degranulation of lysosomes {{is one of}} the {{consequences}} of neutrophil activation. Regulatory mechanisms of lysosomal secretion are thought to be localized largely in the plasma membrane and cytosol, with the lysosome playing a passive role in secretion. Recent evidence indicates that the intralysosomal pH is highly acidic (pH congruent to 5. 5) and is maintained by active transport of H+. We investigated whether changes in the intralysosomal pH altered the availability of lysosomes for exocytosis. Intralysosomal pH in intact neutrophils was monitored with the weakly basic fluorescent probe, 9 -aminoacridine (9 AA). The weak bases, methylamine, chloroquine, clindamycin, <b>propanolol,</b> and ammonium chloride (0. 1 - 50 mM), caused an alkalinization of the intralysosomal pH as determined by reversal of quenching of 9 AA fluorescence. Similarly, each of the weak bases, including ammonium chloride, methylamine, chloroquine, ethylamine, propylamine, <b>propanolol,</b> clindamycin, and dansylcadaverine, inhibited neutrophil degranulation in response to the calcium ionophore A 23187, phorbol myristate acetate, or the chemotactic peptide, formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine plus cytochalasin B.

Twelve adult male Wistar rats divided into 3 groups of 4 animals each were used and were treated orally with normal saline (control group), <b>propanolol</b> (positive control, and was given at 1 mg/kg) and 200 mg/kg of AP seed extract over a 4 - week period.

The mean arterial blood pressure of the normal saline treated animal was 60 mmHg, those of <b>propanolol</b> treated animals was 23 mmHg while the 200 mg/kg extract treated group was 30 mmHg. Phytochemical screening showed that the extract contained cardiac glycosides, tannins, saponins, alkaloids and flavonoids. Cyanogenetic glycosides and anthraquinones were absent. The sodium level for the 200 mg/kg group was significantly lower than that of control group. The total bilirubin, total protein and the globulin fraction were significantly higher in the extract treated groups compared to the control group.

In this study we show that human ZAG, which is a 41 -kDa protein, when administered to ob/ob mice at 50 µg/d- 1 orally in the drinking water produced a progressive loss of body weight (5 g after 8 d treatment), together with a 0. 5 C increase in rectal temperature and a 40 % reduction in urinary excretion of glucose. There was also a 33 % reduction in the area under the curve during an oral glucose tolerance test and an increased sensitivity to insulin. These results were similar to those after iv administration of ZAG. However, tryptic digestion was shown to inactivate ZAG. There was no evidence of human ZAG in the serum but a 2 -fold elevation of murine ZAG, which was also observed in target tissues such as white adipose tissue.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the biochemical and cellular {{basis for the}} rise in polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) count during epinephrine administration, PMN from subjects receiving epinephrine were studied for their capacity to adhere to nylon wool fibers and endothelial cell monolayers. After administration of epinephrine, the PMN count increased by 80 % at 5 min, and isolated PMN adherence to nylon fibers fell from a base line of 44 ± 2 - 18 ± 3 %. In contrast, when subjects were infused with the β-antagonist <b>propanolol</b> before receiving epinephrine, the PMN count failed to rise and PMN adherence was normal. Exposure of PMN endothelial cell monolayers to 0. 1 μM epinephrine led to diminished PMN adherence that could be blocked by 10 μM <b>propanolol</b> but not by 10 μM phentolamine. Sera obtained from subjects 5 min after receiving epinephrine or from supernates derived from endothelial cell monolayers exposed to 90 nM epinephrine inhibited PMN adherence to nylon fibers. Addition of anticyclic AMP antisera but not anticyclic guanosine monophosphate antisera to the postepinephrine sera or to the postepinephrine supernate derived from the endothelial cell monolayers abolished their inhibitory effect of PMN adherence to nylon fibers. In contrast, direct exposure of PMN to epinephrine failed to affect their adherent properties. Because it has been previously shown that endothelial cells contain β-receptors and respond to catecholamines by raising their intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP, and that PMN adherence is attenuated by cyclic AMP, {{it would appear that}} diminished PMN adherence after epinephrine administration is mediated through endothelial cell β-receptor activity, which in turn impairs PMN margination in vivo and could account for the rise in circulating PMN...|$|E

In addition, the in vitro drug release from the microspheres was performed in pH 1. 2 and 7. 2. The results showed that the produced microspheres of PCSS and its combination with HPMC and Carbopol 974 P were irregular shape with a rough surface morphology and have particles sizes range of 2. 5 - 28 μm. <b>Propanolol</b> hydrochloride (PH) was incorporated into the microspheres with an efficiency of range between 84 - 100 %. On gastric mucosa, the microspheres of PCSS, HPMC and PCSS-HPMC were more mucoadhesive than the microspheres of Carbopol 974 P and PCSS-Carbopol 974 P. On the other hand, all kinds of the microspheres show good mucoadhesive properties on intestinal mucosa.
