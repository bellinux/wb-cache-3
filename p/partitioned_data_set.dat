40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to write a Superwylbur macro, called D 50 TD 80, for the Computing Information center at Northern Illinois University. The project was {{completed}} using Superwylbur, an interactive computing environment which enables access to the University’s mainframe computer. Superwylbur macro programming combines Superwylbur commands along {{with a set of}} special instructions for branching and decision making. The D 50 TD 80 macro was designed to assist users in moving data sets from the current 3350 disk packs to the newly installed, more efficient 3380 disk packs. This macro allows the user three options: 1) To create a <b>partitioned</b> <b>data</b> <b>set</b> from sequential data sets, and place on a 3380 disk pack, 2) To move an entire <b>partitioned</b> <b>data</b> <b>set</b> to a 3380 disk pack, and 3) To move a sequential data set to a 3380 disk pack. Options 2 and 3 are executed by calling modified versions of existing macros. Changes to these macros included additional error checking and more informative prompts. The first option begins by asking the user for the name and location of the <b>partitioned</b> <b>data</b> <b>set</b> that they wish to create. The user is next prompted for the names of the sequential data sets to be saved as members of the <b>partitioned</b> <b>data</b> <b>set.</b> The requested data sets are then placed into the specified PDS. The macro was coded to be user friendly by anticipating a variety of user errors, and making the prompts and error messages friendly, yet informative. The method followed to complete the end product was basically a “hands on” approach. Using The Superwylbur Macro Programming Manual as a primary reference, a simple macro was written which can assist a user in uploading and downloading files from Superwylbur. After some practice with the language, the D 50 TD 80 macro was coded. This macro will be available for public use in the Spring of 1989. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|E

40|$|We have {{implemented}} an image combining architecture that allows distributed rendering of a <b>partitioned</b> <b>data</b> <b>set</b> at interactive rates. The architecture achieves real-time frame rates and low latency through pipelining {{and the use}} of a high bandwidth network technology to transfer the image data. It is flexible because it uses programmable FPGA devices to implement the combining logic. The implementation cost is kept low by using only commodity components for the network and graphics, and FPGA logic. The result is a cost-effective interactive visualization system that can be used with a variety of applications running on distributed computing systems such as cluster of workstations and personal computers. We first motivate the development of a distributed rendering system and we introduce some of the concepts related to the 3 D-visualization domain. We then describe our implementation of this system using the PCI Pamette FPGA-based board. We emphasize the advantages of using a programmable board for the prototype development and also for a potential commercial version. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—To {{improve the}} {{accuracy}} of learning result, in practice multiple parties may collaborate through conducting joint Back-propagation neural network learning on the union of their respective data sets. During this process no party wants to disclose her/his private data to others. Existing schemes supporting this kind of collaborative learning are either limited {{in the way of}} data partition or just consider two parties. There lacks a solution that allows two or more parties, each with an arbitrarily <b>partitioned</b> <b>data</b> <b>set,</b> to collaboratively conduct the learning. This paper solves this open problem by utilizing the power of cloud computing. In our proposed scheme, each party encrypts his/her private data locally and uploads the ciphertexts into the cloud. The cloud then executes most of the operations pertaining to the learning algorithms over ciphertexts without knowing the original private data. By securely offloading the expensive operations to the cloud, we keep the computation and communication costs on each party minimal and independent to the number of participants. To support flexible operations over ciphertexts, we adopt and tailor the BGN‘doubly homomorphic ’ encryption algorithm for the multi-party setting. Numerical analysis and experiments on commodity cloud show that our scheme is secure, efficient and accurate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Decision tree {{induction}} algorithms generally adopt a greedy {{approach to}} select attributes {{in order to}} optimize some criteria at each iteration of the tree induction process. When a decision tree has been constructed, a set of decision rules may be correspondingly derived. Univariate decision tree induction algorithms generally yield the same tree regardless of how many times it is induced from the same training data set. Genetic algorithms {{have been shown to}} discover a better set of rules, albeit at the expense of efficiency. In this paper, we propose a protocol for secure genetic algorithms for the following scenario: Two parties, each holding an arbitrarily <b>partitioned</b> <b>data</b> <b>set,</b> seek to perform genetic algorithms to discover a better set of rules without disclosing their own private data. The challenge for privacy-preserving genetic algorithms is to allow the two parties to securely and jointly evaluate the fitness value of each chromosome using each party’s private data but without compromising their data privacy. We propose a new protocol to address this challenge that is correct and secure. The proposed protocol is not only privacy-preserving at each iteration of the genetic algorithm, the intermediate results generated at each iteration do not compromise the data privacy of the participating parties. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the intraindividual variation {{present in the}} first ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS 1) of Anopheles farauti to determine the level of divergence among populations for this important malarial vector. We isolated 187 clones from 70 individuals and found regional variation among four internal tandem repeats. The data were partitioned prior to analysis given {{the presence of a}} paralogous ITS 2 sequence, called the 52 ̆ 7 -subrepeat, inserted in the ITS 1 of most clones. A high level of homogenization and population differentiation was observed for this repeat, which indicates a higher rate of turnover relative to the adjacent 2 ̆ 7 core 2 ̆ 7 region. Bayesian analysis was performed using several substitutional models on both a combined and a <b>partitioned</b> <b>data</b> <b>set.</b> On the whole, the ITS 1 phylogeny and geographic origin of the samples appear to be congruent. Some interesting exceptions indicate the spread of variant repeats between populations and the retention of ancestral polymorphism. Our data clearly demonstrate concerted evolution at the intraspecific level despite intraindividual variation and a complex internal repeat structure from a species that occupies a continuous coastal distribution. A high rate of genomic turnover in combination {{with a high level of}} sequence divergence appears to be a major factor leading to its concerted evolution within these populations...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to perform a {{comparative}} study of prediction performances of an artificial neutral network (ANN) model against a linear prediction model like a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with regards to forecasting corporate credit ratings from financial statement data. Design/methodology/approach – The ANN model used in the study is a fully connected back-propagation model with three layers of neurons. The paper uses a comparative approach whereby two prediction models – one based on ANN and the other based on LDA are developed using identically <b>partitioned</b> <b>data</b> <b>set.</b> Findings – The study found that the ANN model comprehensively outperformed the LDA model in both training and test partitions of the data set. While the LDA model may have been hindered by omitted variables; this actually lends further credence to the ANN model showing that the latter is more robust in dealing with missing data. Research limitations/implications – A possible drawback in the model implementation probably lies in the selection of the various accounting ratios. Perhaps future replications of this study should look more carefully at choosing the ratios after duly addressing the problems of collinearity and duplications more rigorously. Practical implications – The findings of this study imply that since ANN models can better deal with complex data sets and do not require restraining assumptions like linearity and normality, it may be overall a better approach in corporate credit rating forecasts that uses large financial data sets. Originality/value – This study brings out the effectiveness of non-linear pattern learning models as compared to linear ones in forecasts of financial solvency. This goes on to further highlight the practical importance of the new breed of computational tools available to techno-savvy financial analysts and also to the providers of corporate credit. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|E
40|$|The cross-recognition of {{peptides}} by cytotoxic T lymphocytes is a {{key element}} in immunology and in particular in peptide based immunotherapy. Here we develop three-dimensional (3 D) quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) to predict cross-recognition by Melan-A-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes of peptides bound to HLA A* 0201 (hereafter referred to as HLA A 2). First, we predict the structure of a set of self- and pathogen-derived peptides bound to HLA A 2 using a previously developed ab initio structure prediction approach [Fagerberg et al., J. Mol. Biol., 521 - 46 (2006) ]. Second, shape and electrostatic energy calculations are performed on a 3 D grid to produce similarity matrices which are combined with a genetic neural network method [So et al., J. Med. Chem., 4347 - 59 (1997) ] to generate 3 D-QSAR models. The models are extensively validated using several different approaches. During the model generation, the leave-one-out cross-validated correlation coefficient (q (2)) is used as the fitness criterion and all obtained models are evaluated based on their q (2) values. Moreover, the best model obtained for a <b>partitioned</b> <b>data</b> <b>set</b> is evaluated by its correlation coefficient (r = 0. 92 for the external test set). The physical relevance of all models is tested using a functional dependence analysis and the robustness of the models obtained for the entire data set is confirmed using y-randomization. Finally, the validated models are tested for their utility in the setting of rational peptide design: their ability to discriminate between peptides that only contain side chain substitutions in a single secondary anchor position is evaluated. In addition, the predicted cross-recognition of the mono-substituted peptides is confirmed experimentally in chromium-release assays. These results underline the utility of 3 D-QSARs in peptide mimetic design and suggest that the properties of the unbound epitope are sufficient to capture most of the information to determine the cross-recognition...|$|E
