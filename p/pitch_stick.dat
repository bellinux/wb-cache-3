The paper includes a description of the facilities, a detailed review of the feedback controller design, linear analysis results of the feedback controller, a description of the feed-forward controller design, nonlinear batch simulation results, and piloted simulation results. Batch simulation results include maximum <b>pitch</b> <b>stick</b> agility responses, angle of attack alpha captures, and alpha regulation for full lateral stick rolls at several alpha's. Piloted simulation results include task descriptions for several types of maneuvers, task guidelines, the corresponding Cooper-Harper ratings from three test pilots, and some pilot comments.

40|$|Historically, component-type flight {{mechanics}} simulation models of helicopters {{have been unable}} to satisfactorily predict the roll response to <b>pitch</b> <b>stick</b> input and the pitch response to roll stick input off-axes responses. In the study presented here, simple first-order low-pass filtering of the elemental lift and drag forces was considered as a means of improving the correlation. The method was applied to a blade-element model of the AH- 64 APache, and responses of the modified model were compared with flight data in hover and forward flight. Results indicate that significant improvement in the off-axes responses can be achieved in hover. In forward flight, however, the best correlation in the longitudinal and lateral off-axes responses required different values of the filter time constant for each axis. A compromise value was selected and was shown to result in good overall improvement in the off-axes responses. The paper describes both the method and the model used for its implementation, and presents results obtained at hover and in forward flight...|$|E
40|$|This {{progress}} report {{presents the results}} of an investigation focused on parameter identification for the NASA F/A- 18 HARV. This aircraft was used in the high alpha research program at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. In this study the longitudinal and lateral-directional stability derivatives are estimated from flight data using the Maximum Likelihood method coupled with a Newton-Raphson minimization technique. The objective is to estimate an aerodynamic model describing the aircraft dynamics over a range of angle of attack from 5 deg to 60 deg. The mathematical model is built using the traditional static and dynamic derivative buildup. Flight data used in this analysis were from a variety of maneuvers. The longitudinal maneuvers included large amplitude multiple doublets, optimal inputs, frequency sweeps, and pilot <b>pitch</b> <b>stick</b> inputs. The lateral-directional maneuvers consisted of large amplitude multiple doublets, optimal inputs and pilot stick and rudder inputs. The parameter estimation code pEst, developed at NASA Dryden, was used in this investigation. Results of the estimation process from alpha = 5 deg to alpha = 60 deg are presented and discussed...|$|E

40|$|Subject of {{this paper}} is the design of a {{training}} device for a modern lightweight gyroplane. A simulation model which comprises all relevant characteristics of a gyroplane and which is capable of real time simulation is developed. The gyroplane body and its rotor are considered as two individual masses. The <b>pitch</b> and roll <b>stick</b> forces are the input signals to the simulation instead of the commonly used stick deflections. Flight tests with an instrumented gyroplane of type MTOsport were conducted to estimate the unknown parameters of the simulation model and to validate it. The flight maneuvers were defined according to ICAO requirements. Simultaneously a basic training device for pilot training was built at DLR. Preliminary results whether this training device is able to improve training efficiency are shown...|$|R

The tests have been performed & on a ground simulator with one degree of freedom, <b>pitch.</b> The <b>stick</b> force and stick displacement per unit response were variable, and the period and damping characteristics could be sdjusted to cover the ranges * existing for most airplsne types. For this investigation the period snd dsmping of the ground simulator were typical of those of current fighters operating at low altitudes and at subsonic speeds. The results of the tests for a wel&dsmped airplane show that, as the required stick displacements were reduced, the accuracy of the sub-Sects in performing the tracking task improved. The tests also showed that, as the force required was reduced, the accuracy improved. The control technique used by the subjects in this investigation may be somewhat different from that used in actual flight.

40|$|An {{extended}} Kalman filter (EKF) is used {{to estimate}} the parameters of a low-order model from aircraft transient response data. The low-order model is a state space model derived from the short-period approximation of the longitudinal aircraft dynamics.

Because of the model chosen, handling qualities information is also obtained. The parameters are estimated from flight data {{as well as from}} a six-degree-of-freedom, nonlinear simulation of the aircraft. These two estimates are then compared and the discrepancies noted. The low-order model is able to satisfactorily match both flight data and simulation data from a high-order computer simulation. The parameters obtained from the EKF analysis of flight data are compared to those obtained using frequency response analysis of the flight data. Time delays and damping ratios are compared and are in agreement. This technique demonstrates the potential to determine, in near real time, the extent of differences between computer models and the actual aircraft. Precise knowledge of these differences can help to determine the flying qualities of a test aircraft and lead to more efficient envelope expansion...|$|R
