Despite <b>packaging</b> <b>labels</b> shown by aftermarket parts makers, AM's first V8 engine only served Nash and Hudson nameplates for two years.

2500|$|These {{data are}} {{measured}} through spectrophotometry reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. Higher absorbances imply {{greater levels of}} crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, and thus a greater colouring potential and therefore strength per gram. The absorbance reading of crocin {{is known as the}} [...] "colouring strength" [...] of that saffron. Saffron's colouring strength can range from lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 200 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected, most red-maroon, tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive colouring strengths in excess of 250, making such saffron over three times more powerful than category IV saffron. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO categories. Sargol and coupé saffron would typically fall into ISO 3632 category I. Pushal and mancha would probably be assigned to category II. On many saffron <b>packaging</b> <b>labels,</b> neither the ISO 3632 category nor the colouring strength (the measurement of crocin content) is displayed.|$|E
40|$|The Commonwealth of Australia {{has begun}} the {{implementation}} of a new front <b>package</b> <b>labelling</b> system for <b>packaged</b> food products. Despite calls from various health groups advocating for a mandatory front <b>package</b> <b>labelling</b> system, the Commonwealth opted for a voluntary system that relies on the goodwill of individual companies for its implementation. In discussing Australia’s obesity epidemic that has given rise to a need for front <b>package</b> <b>labelling,</b> this paper examines the constitutionality of mandatory front <b>package</b> <b>labelling</b> requirements. It argues that as the Commonwealth Government has the requisite jurisdiction to make the system mandatory it should forego voluntary implementation in favour of a mandatory system...|$|R

50|$|A {{label printer}} is a {{computer}} printer that prints on self-adhesive label material and/or card-stock (tags). A label printer with built-in keyboard and display for stand-alone use (not connected to a separate computer) is often called a label maker. Label printers are different from ordinary printers because {{they need to have}} special feed mechanisms to handle rolled stock, or tear sheet (fanfold) stock. Common connectivity for label printers include RS-232 serial, Universal Serial Bus (USB), parallel, Ethernet and various kinds of wireless.

To meet the demand for printed envelopes and <b>packaging</b> <b>labels,</b> they moved their press to Gibraltar. They were unable to live there, as it required special permission, so they settled in the Spanish-ruled town of La Línea de la Concepción {{on the border with}} Gibraltar and walked across the frontier each day to operate their press. In 1889, Cruz Herrera's father, José de la Cruz Garcia, married a local woman - 19-year-old Antonia Herrera Ramírez, the niece of La Línea's first mayor - and was himself mayor of the town for a short time. Eight months later on 1 October 1890, Cruz Herrera was born as the first of seven children and was named after his grandfather, who like his father was also named José. He was given the birthname of José Maria Remigio.|$|E
