25|$|A {{theory that}} speaks to {{the origin of life}} on Earth and other rocky planets posits life as an {{information}} system in which information content grows because of selection. Life must start with minimum possible information, or minimum possible departure from thermodynamic equilibrium, and it requires thermodynamically free energy accessible by means of its information content. The most benign circumstances, minimum entropy variations with abundant free energy, suggest the <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> in the first few kilometres of the surface. Free energy is derived from the condensed products of the chemical reactions taking place in the cooling nebula.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{environmental}} conditions present {{at the time of}} their formation, concretions can be created by either concentric or pervasive growth (Mozley, 1996; Raiswell and Fisher, 2000). In concentric growth, the concretion grows as successive layers of mineral precipitate around a central core. This process results in roughly spherical concretions that grow with time. In the case of pervasive growth, cementation of the host sediments, by infilling of its <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> by precipitated minerals, occurs simultaneously throughout the volume of the area, which in time becomes a concretion. Concretions are often exposed at the surface by subsequent erosion that removes the weaker, uncemented material.|$|E
25|$|Porosity (n) is a {{directly}} measurable aquifer property; it is {{a fraction}} between 0 and 1 indicating {{the amount of}} <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> between unconsolidated soil particles or within a fractured rock. Typically, the majority of groundwater (and anything dissolved in it) moves through the porosity available to flow (sometimes called effective porosity). Permeability {{is an expression of}} the connectedness of the pores. For instance, an unfractured rock unit may have a high porosity (it has lots of holes between its constituent grains), but a low permeability (none of the pores are connected). An example of this phenomenon is pumice, which, when in its unfractured state, can make a poor aquifer.|$|E

Soil organisms (e.g. earthworms, termites, ants, some insects’ larvae) can make the <b>pore</b> <b>spaces</b> and hence can change the soil shape. Mesofauna contribute to habitable <b>pore</b> <b>spaces</b> and account for a small portion of total <b>pore</b> <b>spaces</b> (Hassink et al. 1993).|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we use energy-based {{perturbation}} {{criteria to}} examine whether strain or electrostatic energy acts as a driving force for porosity initiation in anodic oxides. By doing so, we also succeeded to rationalise the dependence of <b>pore</b> <b>spacing</b> on anodising conditions. Our experimental approach consists of measuring in-situ the internal stress in anodic oxide films grown galvanostatically on aluminium in phosphoric acid, and to correlate these data with the measured <b>pore</b> <b>spacing</b> of the obtained porous films. Our {{results indicate that the}} possibility of a strain energy-induced surface instability is unlikely, as for this case the constitutive dependence of <b>pore</b> <b>spacing</b> on internal stress was not verified. Instead, the measured <b>pore</b> <b>spacing,</b> electric field and barrier oxide thickness obtained on our anodic alumina films indicate that electrostatic energy is the main driving force for pore initiation, as well as the factor controlling the <b>pore</b> <b>spacing.</b> Corroborative quantitative evidence for this novel electrostatic-based scaling law is provided by data compiled from the literature for a range of other anodic oxide systems, including nanoporous alumina and nanotubular titania films.

25|$|When {{sedimentation}} continues, {{an older}} rock layer becomes buried deeper as a result. The lithostatic {{pressure in the}} rock increases due to {{the weight of the}} overlying sediment. This causes compaction, a process in which grains mechanically reorganize. Compaction is, for example, an important diagenetic process in clay, which can initially consist of 60% water. During compaction, this interstitial water is pressed out of pore spaces. Compaction can also be the result of dissolution of grains by pressure solution. The dissolved material precipitates again in open pore spaces, which means there is a net flow of material into the pores. However, in some cases, a certain mineral dissolves and does not precipitate again. This process, called leaching, increases <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> in the rock.|$|E
25|$|The {{carbonate}} minerals {{are those}} were the main anionic group is carbonate, 2−. Carbonates tend to be brittle, many have rhombohedral cleavage, and all react with acid. Due to the last characteristic, field geologists often carry dilute hydrochloric acid to distinguish carbonates from non-carbonates. The reaction of acid with carbonates, most commonly found as the polymorph calcite and aragonite (CaCO3), relates to the dissolution and precipitation of the mineral, which is a key {{in the formation of}} limestone caves, features within them such as stalactite and stalagmites, and karst landforms. Carbonates are most often formed as biogenic or chemical sediments in marine environments. The carbonate group is structurally a triangle, where a central C4+ cation is surrounded by three O2− anions; different groups of minerals form from different arrangements of these triangles. The most common carbonate mineral is calcite, and is the primary constituent of sedimentary limestone and metamorphic marble. Calcite, CaCO3, can have a high magnesium impurity; under high-Mg conditions, its polymorph aragonite will form instead; the marine geochemistry in this regard can be described as an aragonite or calcite sea, depending on which mineral preferentially forms. Dolomite is a double carbonate, with the formula CaMg(CO3)2. Secondary dolomitization of limestone is common, where calcite or aragonite are converted to dolomite; this reaction increases <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> (the unit cell volume of dolomite is 88% that of calcite), which can create a reservoir for oil and gas. These two minerals species are members of eponymous mineral groups: the calcite group includes carbonates with the general formula XCO3, and the dolomite group constitutes minerals with general formula XY(CO3)2.|$|E
500|$|After deposition, snow {{progresses}} {{on one of}} two {{paths that}} determine its fate, either ablation (mostly by melting) or transitioning from firn (multi-year snow) into glacier ice. During this transition, snow [...] "is a highly porous, sintered material {{made up of a}} continuous ice structure and a continuously connected <b>pore</b> <b>space,</b> forming together the snow microstructure". Almost always near its melting temperature, a snowpack is continually transforming these properties in a process, known as metamorphism, wherein all three phases of water may coexist, including liquid water partially filling the <b>pore</b> <b>space.</b> Starting as a powdery deposition, snow becomes more granular when it begins to compact under its own weight, be blown by the wind, sinter particles together and commence the cycle of melting and refreezing. Water vapor plays a role as it deposits ice crystals, known as hoar frost, during cold, still conditions.|$|E
30|$|Detailed {{investigation}} with SEM {{shows that}} barite occurs in {{only some of}} the <b>pore</b> <b>spaces</b> of an individual rock samples, whereas others remain almost unchanged. The growth features observed for barite imply a crystallization sequence in the experiments. In the beginning, the growth of the barite crystals is tabular (Fig.  10) with a size of approx. 15  µm in the larger <b>pore</b> <b>spaces.</b> Once a barite crystal is formed, it acts as a seed and is overgrown by further barite precipitations forming a crystal agglomerate (Fig.  11). The crystal shape of the agglomerate is mostly platy with a well-defined cleavage. Crystal agglomerates {{can be found in a}} part of the <b>pore</b> <b>spaces</b> of all sandstone samples after experiment, which were either unfilled before the experiment or partially filled with clay minerals and hematite. In the latter case, the barite overgrows the illite along the margins of the pore (Fig.  12). Quartz grains have smooth surfaces with small holes and often show dissolution edges (Fig.  18), whereas such features are absent in the feldspar. Especially in the smaller pores and cracks, subhedral baryte crystals grow together forming crystal aggregates. With increasing growth or narrowing of the <b>pore</b> <b>spaces,</b> the crystals preferentially accumulate at the bottlenecks of the <b>pore</b> <b>spaces</b> (Fig.  13). This can lead to a clogging of the whole interspaces. Finally, the <b>pore</b> <b>spaces</b> and cracks get completely filled with barite crystals (Figs.  14 and 15).|$|R

40|$|<b>Pore</b> <b>spaces</b> {{heterogeneity}} in carbonates rocks {{has long}} been identified as an important factor impacting reservoir productivity. In this paper, we study the heterogeneity of carbonate rocks <b>pore</b> <b>spaces</b> based on the image analysis of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data acquired at various magnifications. Sixty images of twelve carbonate samples from a reservoir in the Middle East were analyzed. First, <b>pore</b> <b>spaces</b> were extracted from SEM images using a segmentation technique based on watershed algorithm. Pores geometries revealed a multifractal behavior at various magnifications from 800 x to 12 000 x. In addition, the singularity spectrum provided quantitative values that describe the degree of heterogeneity in the carbonates samples. Moreover, {{for the majority of}} the analyzed samples, we found low variations (around 5 %) in the multifractal dimensions for magnifications between 1700 x and 12 000 x. Finally, these results demonstrate that multifractal analysis could be an appropriate tool for characterizing quantitatively the heterogeneity of carbonate <b>pore</b> <b>spaces</b> geometries. However, our findings show that magnification has an impact on multifractal dimensions, revealing the limit of applicability of multifractal descriptions for these natural structures...|$|R

Consequently, the identification of different plugging mechanisms is very important for optimisation of heap leaching processes. This paper reviews various <b>pore</b> <b>spaces</b> plugging mechanisms, including ore heap compaction, migration of fine particles, presence of large fractions of clays in ores, agglomerate destruction under acid effect and dissolution-precipitation processes. Proactive plugging reduction techniques including ore placement, ore agglomeration, heap aeration and lixiviant application techniques are also explained as means to prevent <b>pore</b> <b>spaces</b> plugging during heap leaching operations. The findings of this paper can be useful in guiding laboratory and industrial heap leaching operations...|$|R

In this paper, we introduce an aliveness detection method based on multiple static features, which derived from a single fingerprint image. The static features are comprised of individual <b>pore</b> <b>spacing,</b> residual noise and several first order statistics. Specifically, correlation filter is adopted to address individual <b>pore</b> <b>spacing.</b> The multiple static features are useful to reflect the physiological and statistical characteristics of live and fake fingerprint. The classification can be made by calculating the liveness scores from each feature and fusing the scores through a classifier. In our dataset, we compare nine classifiers and the best classification rate at 85 % is attained by using a Reduced Multivariate Polynomial classifier. Our approach is faster and more convenient for aliveness check for field applications.

2500|$|Due {{to surface}} tension, water will rise up {{in a small}} {{capillary}} tube above a free surface of water.

[...] Above the height of capillary saturation, the soil may be wet but the water content will decrease with elevation. If the water in the capillary zone is not moving, the water pressure obeys the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, , but note that , is negative above the water table.
