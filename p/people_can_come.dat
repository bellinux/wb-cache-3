500|$|Although {{at least}} one {{organization}} criticized the aquarium for attempting to keep white sharks in captivity, several independent shark researchers expressed approval for the logistical design and the educational impact of Project White Shark, and some scientific insights from it. On its educational impact, a white shark researcher from Australia stated in 2006 that [...] "the fact <b>people</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> and see these animals and learn from them is of immeasurable value." [...] The first captive white shark—on exhibit in 2004 {{for more than six}} months—was seen by one million visitors, and another million visitors saw either the second or third white sharks on display. [...] Monterey Bay Aquarium is the only public aquarium in the world to have successfully exhibited a white shark for more than 16 days.|$|E
500|$|Schwartz {{uses the}} [...] "Unlimited" [...] theme {{as the second}} major motif running through the score. Although not {{included}} as a titled song, the theme appears as an interlude {{in several of the}} musical numbers. In a tribute to Harold Arlen, who wrote the score for the 1939 film adaptation, the [...] "Unlimited" [...] melody incorporates the first seven notes of the song [...] "Over the Rainbow." [...] Schwartz included it as an inside joke as, [...] "according to copyright law, {{when you get to the}} eighth note, then <b>people</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> and say, 'Oh you stole our tune.' And of course obviously it's also disguised in that it's completely different rhythmically. And it's also harmonized completely differently.... It's over a different chord and so on, but still it's the first seven notes of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'". Schwartz further obscured the motif's origin by setting it in a minor key in most instances. This also creates contrast in the songs in which it forms a part, for example in [...] "Defying Gravity", which is written primarily in the key of D-flat major. In the song [...] "The Wicked Witch of the East", however, when Elphaba finally uses her powers to let her sister walk, the [...] "Unlimited" [...] theme is played in a major key.|$|E

6000|$|Suddenly I observed, what I had {{not noticed}} before, {{that there was a}} narrow {{aperture}} in the rocky wall. I took up the lamp and examined it; the aperture led to a passage. Now, I was still sufficiently sensible to remember that it is not pleasant, in such a situation as ours was, to have passages running into one's bed-chamber from no one knows where. If there are passages, <b>people</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> up them; they can come up when one is asleep. Partly to see where it went to, and partly from a restless desire to be doing something, I followed the passage. It led to a stone stair, which I descended; the stair ended in another passage, or rather tunnel, also hewn out of the bed-rock, and running, so far as I could judge, exactly beneath the gallery that led to the entrance of our rooms, and across the great central cave. I went on down it: it was as silent as the grave, but still, drawn by some sensation or attraction that I cannot define, I followed on, my stockinged feet falling without noise on the smooth and rocky floor. When I had traversed some fifty yards of space, I came to another passage running at right angles, and here an awful thing happened to me: the sharp draught caught my lamp and extinguished it, leaving me in utter darkness in the bowels of that mysterious place. I took a couple of strides forward so as to clear the bisecting tunnel, being terribly afraid lest I should turn up it in the dark if once I got confused as to the direction, and then paused to think. What was I to do? I had no match; it seemed awful to attempt that long journey back through the utter gloom, and yet I could not stand there all night, and, if I did, probably it would not help me much, for {{in the bowels of the}} rock it would be as dark at midday as at midnight. I looked back over my shoulder--not a sight or a sound. I peered forward into the darkness: surely, far away, I saw something like the faint glow of fire. Perhaps it was a cave where I could get a light--at any rate, it was worth investigating. Slowly and painfully I crept along the tunnel, keeping my hand against its wall, and feeling at every step with my foot before I put it down, fearing lest I should fall into some pit. Thirty paces--there was a light, a broad light that came and went, shining through curtains! Fifty paces--it was close at hand! Sixty--oh, great heaven! ...|$|E
