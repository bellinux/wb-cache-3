25|$|Ore {{processing}} was {{the work}} of independent Washing Masters, who took a bargain {{for a year or more}} to carry out a particular job, and were <b>paid</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> per ton of lead smelted. They then hired boys and young men to do the work. This system lasted until 1855, when the last of the washing contracts were made. After that the company took control of the operation and paid weekly wages to the washers. Contracts continued for smelting as well as carting and smith work.|$|E

25|$|Merlin {{had planned}} to go public in early 2010, but market {{turbulence}} postponed those plans. Instead, Blackstone sold 20% of the company to the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners, reducing Blackstone's holding to 34%. CVC acquired another 8% from the Dubai investment fund which is no longer involved with the company, giving it 28% in all. KIRKBI, a Danish family trust that owns LEGO, also increased its stake, emerging as the largest shareholder, with 36%. CVC <b>paid</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> that valued Merlin at £2.25 billion – more than six times what Merlin and Legoland together were worth when Blackstone acquired them five years earlier. Blackstone's investment was by that point worth more than {{three and a half}} times what it had paid.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{basketball}} observers, {{in addition}} to Abdul-Jabbar, believe that Kareem's reticence, whether through disdain for the press corps or simply because of introversion, contributed to the dearth of coaching opportunities offered to Abdul-Jabbar by the NBA. In his words, {{he said he had}} a mindset he could not overcome, and proceeded through his career oblivious to the effect his reticence may have had on his future coaching prospects. Abdul-Jabbar said: [...] "I didn't understand that I also had affected people that way and that's what it was all about. I always saw it like they were trying to pry. I was way too suspicious and I <b>paid</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> for it." [...] Since he began lobbying for a coaching position in 1995, he has managed to obtain only low-level assistant and scouting jobs in the NBA, and a head coaching position only in a minor professional league.|$|E

2500|$|After 1902, {{only the}} Cunard Line and the French Compagnie Générale Transatlantique (CGT) were {{independent}} of the IMM combine.

2500|$|Ryerson <b>paid</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> for his {{commitment}} to the CPC and his analysis of Canadian history. Upon his return to Canada from his studies in Europe, he took up party work in August 1934 in Montreal where he taught French studies at Sir George Williams University. Ryerson had been working very closely with the CPC and in 1935 {{he was elected to the}} Central Committee (CC) and was elected provincial secretary in 1936. He held his position at the College for three years until his secret was discovered; all the while working and writing under the pseudonym of E. Roger to protect his job, his politics would lead to his eventual non-renewal in 1937. Ryerson's next academic position would not come for 35 years, a year after he parted company with the CPC, he would accept a position in the History department at the Université du Québec à Montréal, and [...] "at age 58, he commenced the academic career he had sacrificed in the 1930s." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 1854, {{with no time}} to lose {{before the}} opening of the exposition, the Pereire {{brothers}} created a new company to construct the street and the hotel. [...] They sold 240,000 shares for one hundred francs each, with 106,665 shares purchased by Credit Mobilier, 42,220 by the Pereire brothers, and the rest to private investors. [...] At Napoleon's request, new laws had been passed in 1850 and 1851 making it easier for the city to expropriate private land for public purposes. [...] They also allowed the city to expropriate, in the public interest, [...] not only land for new streets, [...] but all of the building sites {{on both sides of the}} new streets, [...] an asset of enormous value. The government expropriated the land, with buildings, that it needed to build the new street and hotel; the owners were <b>paid</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> set by an arbitration board. [...] The government then in turn sold the land and buildings to the company established by the Pereire brothers, which tore down the old buildings, constructed a [...] new street, sidewalks and a new square, the Place du Palais Royale; built new buildings along the new street, and sold them or rented them to new owners. [...] They constructed the Hotel de Louvre, one of the largest buildings in the city and one of the first modern luxury hotels in Paris. [...] The company also built rows of luxury shops under a covered arcade along the Rue de Rivoli and around the hotel, which they rented to shopkeepers. Construction began immediately. Three thousand workers laboured both day and night for two years to complete the street and hotel, [...] which were finished in time for the Exposition.|$|E

60|$|Her {{face was}} {{the face of}} a saint--calm, passionless, and happy, with a gentle, chastened happiness.

Pale and fragile as she had always appeared, she seemed now to have been wasted by some fierce, scathing ordeal, which had driven out of her {{features}} everything human and left only a spiritual life.

Many a stab she had got from the unwitting Tommy as he repeated the gossip of his new friends, and she only won their envy at the cost of their increased ill-will. They thought she was lording it in London, and so they were merciless; had they known how poor she was and how ill, they would have forgotten everything save that she was a Thrummy like themselves, and there were few but would have shared their all with her.

60|$|The {{conflict}} of aims that had at last brought Trafford from scientific investigation into business, had left behind it a little scar of hostility. He felt his sacrifice.

Unconsciously he had become a slightly jealous husband. He resented inattentions and absences. He felt she ought to be with him and orient all her proceedings towards him. He did not like other people to show too marked an appreciation of her. She had a healthy love of admiration, and in addition her social ambitions made it almost inevitable that at times she should use her great personal charm to secure and retain adherents. He was ashamed to betray the resentments thus occasioned, and his silence widened the separation more than any protest could have done....|$|E

If these things had come fairly before me, and been represented to me with whatever force belongs to them, before my accession to the estate,--these and other facts which I have since become acquainted with,--I might have deliberated on the expediency of coming to such a doubtful possession. The property, I assure you, is not so desirable that, taking all things into consideration, it has much increased my happiness.
