50|$|<b>Plasmolysis</b> is {{the process}} in which cells lose water in a {{hypertonic}} solution.

50|$|<b>Plasmolysis</b> is the {{contraction}} of cells within plants {{due to the}} loss of water through osmosis. In a hypertonic environment, the cell membrane peels off of the cell wall and the vacuole collapses. These cells will eventually wilt and die unless the flow of water caused by osmosis can stop {{the contraction}} of the cell membrane.|$|E
50|$|<b>Plasmolysis</b> only {{occurs in}} extreme {{conditions}} and rarely happens in nature. It is induced {{in the laboratory}} by immersing cells in strong saline or sugar (sucrose) solutions to cause exosmosis, often using Elodea plants or onion epidermal cells, which have colored cell sap so that the process is clearly visible. Methylene blue {{can be used to}} stain plant cells.|$|E
50|$|Chilling injury {{occurs at}} 0-10 degrees Celsius, {{as a result}} of {{membrane}} damage, metabolic changes, and toxic buildup. Symptoms include wilting, water soaking, necrosis, chlorosis, ion leakage, and decreased growth. Freezing injury may occur at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius. Symptoms of extracellular freezing include structural damage, dehydration, and necrosis. If intracellular freezing occurs, it will lead to death. Freezing injury is a result of lost permeability, <b>plasmolysis,</b> and post-thaw cell bursting.|$|E
50|$|When plant {{cells are}} in a {{hypertonic}} solution, the flexible cell membrane pulls away from the rigid cell wall, but remains joined to the cell wall at points called plasmodesmata. The cells often take on {{the appearance of a}} pincushion, and the plasmodesmata almost cease to function because they become constricted, a condition known as <b>plasmolysis.</b> In plant cells the terms isotonic, hypotonic and hypertonic cannot strictly be used accurately because the pressure exerted by the cell wall significantly affects the osmotic equilibrium point.|$|E

5000|$|Osmotic {{potential}} {{has important}} implications for many living organisms. If a living cell is surrounded by a more concentrated solution, the cell will tend to lose water to the more negative water potential (...) of the surrounding environment. This can be the case for marine organisms living in sea water and halophytic plants growing in saline environments. In the case of a plant cell, the flow of water out of the cell may eventually cause the plasma membrane to pull away from the cell wall, leading to <b>plasmolysis.</b> Most plants, however, have the ability to increase solute inside the cell to drive the flow of water into the cell and maintain turgor.|$|E
5000|$|If a {{plant cell}} {{is placed in}} a {{hypertonic}} solution, the plant cell loses water and hence turgor pressure by plasmolysis: pressure decreases {{to the point where}} the protoplasm of the cell peels away from the cell wall, leaving gaps between the cell wall and the membrane and making the plant cell shrink and crumple. A continued decrease in pressure eventually leads to cytorrhysis - the complete collapse of the cell wall. Plants with cells in this condition wilt. After <b>plasmolysis</b> the gap between the cell wall and the cell membrane in a plant cell is filled with hypertonic solution. This is because as the solution surrounding the cell is hypertonic, exosmosis takes place and the space between the cell wall and cytoplasm is filled with solutes, as most of the water drains away and hence the concentration inside the cell becomes more hypertonic. There are some mechanisms in plants to prevent excess water loss in the same way as excess water gain. <b>Plasmolysis</b> can be reversed if the cell is placed in a hypotonic solution. Stomata help keep water in the plant so it does not dry out. Wax also keeps water in the plant. The equivalent process in animal cells is called crenation. The liquid content of the cell leaks out due to exosmosis. The cell collapses, and the cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall (in plants). Most animal cells consist of only a phospholipid bilayer (plasma membrane) and not a cell wall, therefore shrinking up under such conditions.|$|E
50|$|If {{the water}} {{potential}} (or strictly, water vapour potential) inside a leaf {{is higher than}} outside, the water vapour will diffuse out of the leaf down this gradient. This loss of water vapour from the leaves is called transpiration, and the water vapour diffuses through the open stomata. Transpiration is natural and inevitable for plants, and much water is lost through this process. However, {{it is vital that}} plants living in dry conditions are adapted so as to reduce this water loss and decrease the size of the open stomata, in order to reduce unnecessary loss from the plant. It is important for a plant living in these conditions to conserve water because, without enough water, plant cells lose turgor. This is known as <b>plasmolysis.</b> If the plant loses too much water, it will pass its permanent wilting point, and die.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{cultures have}} used sugar as a preservative, {{and it was}} commonplace to store fruit in honey. Similar to pickled foods, sugar cane was brought to Europe through the trade routes. In northern climates without sufficient sun to dry foods, preserves are made by heating the fruit with sugar. [...] "Sugar tends to draw water from the microbes (<b>plasmolysis).</b> This process leaves the microbial cells dehydrated, thus killing them. In this way, the food will remain safe from microbial spoilage." [...] Sugar is used to preserve fruits, either in an antimicrobial syrup with fruit such as apples, pears, peaches, apricots, and plums, or in crystallized form where the preserved material is cooked in sugar {{to the point of}} crystallization and the resultant product is then stored dry. This method is used for the skins of citrus fruit (candied peel), angelica, and ginger. Also, sugaring can be used in the production of jam and jelly.|$|E
50|$|For example, in {{hot weather}} they may {{overheat}} and suffer from temperature stress. They have no specific adaptations to overcome this, but, if there is enough water in the soil to allow this, they can increase their rate of transpiration by opening their stomata, thus meaning some heat is removed by the evaporating water. However these plants can only tolerate saturated soil for {{a certain amount of}} time without a warm temperature. In dry weather they may suffer from water stress (losing more water via transpiration than can be gained from the soil). Again they have no specific adaptations to overcome this, and can only respond by closing their stomata to prevent further transpiration. This does actually have some benefits as it reduces the surface area of the leaves exposed to the atmosphere, which reduces transpiration. Prolonged periods of dehydration, however, can lead to permanent wilting, cell <b>plasmolysis,</b> and subsequent death. Since mesophytes prefer moist, well drained soils, most crops are mesophytes. Some examples are: corn (maize), privet, lilac, goldenrod, clover, and oxeye daisy...|$|E
50|$|Cytorrhysis is the {{permanent}} and irreparable {{damage to the}} cell wall after the complete collapse of a plant cell due {{to the loss of}} internal positive pressure (hydraulic turgor pressure). Positive pressure within a plant cell is required to maintain the upright structure of the cell wall. Desiccation (relative water content of {{less than or equal to}} 10%) resulting in cellular collapse occurs when the ability of the plant cell to regulate turgor pressure is compromised by environmental stress. Water continues to diffuse out of the cell after the point of zero turgor pressure, where internal cellular pressure is equal to the external atmospheric pressure, has been reached, generating negative pressure within the cell. That negative pressure pulls the center of the cell inward until the cell wall can no longer withstand the strain. The inward pressure causes the majority of the collapse to occur in the central region of the cell, pushing the organelles within the remaining cytoplasm against the cell walls. Unlike in <b>plasmolysis</b> (a phenomenon that does not occur in nature), the plasma membrane maintains its connections with the cell wall both during and after cellular collapse.|$|E

40|$|Effects of <b>plasmolysis</b> and {{spheroplast}} formation on {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), protein, and phospholipid synthesis by Escherichia coli strain THU were studied. RNA and protein synthesis were severely diminished. DNA and phospholipid synthesis were inhibited, but less so; {{they could be}} partly restored. DNA synthesis could be restored by replacing thymine in the medium with thymidine, and phospholipid synthesis, by adding back small quantities of soluble cell extract. <b>Plasmolysis</b> effected marked reductions in rates of growth and macro-molecule synthesis, and temporarily reduced culture viability. <b>Plasmolysis</b> also caused an anomalous stimulation of phospholipid synthesis.

40|$|AbstractThe {{concentration}} of chemicals inside the bacterial cytoplasm generates an osmotic pressure, termed turgor, which inflates the cell and {{is necessary for}} cell growth and survival. In Escherichia coli, a sudden increase in external concentration causes a pressure drop across the cell envelope that drives changes in cell shape, such as <b>plasmolysis,</b> where {{the inner and outer}} membranes separate. Here, we use fluorescence imaging of single cells during hyperosmotic shock with a time resolution on the order of seconds to examine the response of cells to a range of different conditions. We show that shock using an outer-membrane impermeable solute results in total cell volume reduction with no <b>plasmolysis,</b> whereas a shock caused by outer-membrane permeable ions causes <b>plasmolysis</b> immediately upon shock. Slowly permeable solutes, such as sucrose, which cross the membrane in minutes, cause <b>plasmolysis</b> to occur gradually as the chemical potential equilibrates. In addition, we quantify the detailed morphological changes to cell shape during osmotic shock. Nonplasmolyzed cells shrink in length with an additional lateral size reduction as the magnitude of the shock increases.

The addition of monovalent cations to suspensions in distilled water, Ca 2 + / or Mg 2 +/PIPES prevented the optical density increase induced by Cu 2 +, whereas {{the addition of}} Ca 2 + or Mg 2 + to suspensions in distilled water did not have this effect. Cells suspended in Na+/PIPES and treated with Cu 2 + showed no major ultrastructural alterations, but cells treated with Cu 2 + in distilled water showed pronounced <b>plasmolysis.</b> At all Cu 2 + concentrations, two types of cells were observed, normal and heavily plasmolysed.

The asymmetric positions of lateral <b>plasmolysis</b> bays, caused by their abrupt displacement in the presence of polar bays or constriction sites, does not confirm the periseptal annulus model (Cook et al.), which predicts a gradual and symmetric change in the position of lateral bays with increasing cell length.
