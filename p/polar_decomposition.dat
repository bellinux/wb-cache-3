25|$|The singular-value {{decomposition}} {{was originally}} developed by differential geometers, {{who wished to}} determine whether a real bilinear form could be made equal to another by independent orthogonal transformations of the two spaces it acts on. Eugenio Beltrami and Camille Jordan discovered independently, in 1873 and 1874 respectively, that the singular values of the bilinear forms, represented as a matrix, form a complete set of invariants for bilinear forms under orthogonal substitutions. James Joseph Sylvester also arrived at the singular-value decomposition for real square matrices in 1889, apparently independently of both Beltrami and Jordan. Sylvester called the singular values the canonical multipliers of the matrix A. The fourth mathematician to discover the singular value decomposition independently is Autonne in 1915, who arrived at it via the <b>polar</b> <b>decomposition.</b> The first proof of the singular value decomposition for rectangular and complex matrices seems to be by Carl Eckart and Gale Young in 1936; they saw it as a generalization of the principal axis transformation for Hermitian matrices.|$|E

40|$|There {{are various}} {{definitions}} {{of right and}} left <b>polar</b> <b>decompositions</b> of an m× n matrix F ∈K^m× n (where K=C or R) with respect to bilinear or sesquilinear products defined by nonsingular matrices M∈K^m× m and N∈K^n× n. The existence and uniqueness of such decompositions under various assumptions on F, M, and N have been studied. Here we introduce {{a new form of}} right and left <b>polar</b> <b>decompositions,</b> F=WS and F=S'W', respectively, where the matrix W has orthonormal columns (W' has orthonormal rows) with respect to suitably defined scalar products which are functions of M, N, and F, and the matrix S is selfadjoint with respect to the same suitably defined scalar products and has eigenvalues only in the open right half-plane. We show that our right and left decompositions exist and are unique for any nonsingular matrices M and N when the matrix F satisfies (F^[M,N]) ^[N,M]=F and F^[M,N]F (FF^[M,N], respectively) is nonsingular, where F^[M,N]=N^- 1 F^# M with F^#=F^T for real or complex bilinear forms and F^#=F̅^T for sesquilinear forms. When M=N, our results apply to nonsingular square matrices F. Our assumptions on F, M, and N are in some respects weaker and in some respects stronger than those of previous work on <b>polar</b> <b>decompositions.</b> Comment: 22 page...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, a {{large number}} of {{empirical}} articles on structural decomposition analysis, which aims at disentangling an aggregate change in a variable into its r factors, has been published in this journal. Commonly used methods are the average of the two <b>polar</b> <b>decompositions</b> and the average of all r! elementary decompositions (Dietzenbacher and Los, 1998, D&L). We propose to use instead the 'ideal' Montgomery decomposition, which means that it satisfies the requirement of factor reversal imposed in index number theory. We prefer it to the methods previously mentioned. The average of the two <b>polar</b> <b>decompositions</b> is not 'ideal', so that the outcome depends on the ordering of the factors. The average of all elementary decompositions is 'ideal', but requires the computation of an ever increasing number of decompositions when the number of factors increases. Application to the example of D&L (four factors) shows that the three methods yield results that are close to each other.
