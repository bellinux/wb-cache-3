5000|$|Recently, {{group buying}} {{has been taken}} online in {{numerous}} forms, although group buys prior to 2009 usually referred to the grouping of industrial products for the wholesale market (especially in China). Modern day online group buys are {{a variation of the}} tuángòu buying that occurs in China. Under tuángòu, an item must be bought in a minimum quantity or dollar amount, otherwise the seller will not allow the purchase. Since individuals typically do not need multiples of one item or do not have the resources to buy in bulk, group buys allow people to invite others to <b>purchase</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> jointly. These group buys, often result in better prices for individual buyers or ensure that a scarce or obscure item is available for sale. Group buys were, in the past, often organized by like-minded online shoppers through Internet forums. Now these shoppers have also started to leverage the group buying model for purposes of buying other consumer durables. Group buying sites are back in demand as small businesses look for ways to promote their products to budget-conscious consumers in a weak global economy. Group buying is also used for purchasing real estate properties. Real Estate Group Buying is very popular in India where websites like Group Bookings [...] offers group deals on various properties.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{questionnaire}} based {{survey of}} three hundred families from Udaipur city {{was performed to}} know their consumption pattern of Ghee- anhydrous milk fat. The respondents were divided into Low income group (LIG), Middle income group (MIG) and High income group (HIG) based on their total family income. It was observed 34. 3 %, 30. 0 %, 35. 7 % of these families were from LIG, MIG, HIG respectively. Out of these families 5 were those which did not consumed ghee at all while 7 families were those consuming hydrogenated fat partially. Monthly consumption analysis revealed that majority of three income groups consumed 3 kg / month consumption was observed in MIG and HIG families. Where as on basis of per capita per day consumption in majority families from all three income groups {{it was less than}} 20 g per day which is the normal range for the ghee consumption as recommended by NNMB. Evaluation of purchasing of practice of ghee showed that most the LIG and MIG families purchased ghee as and when required, while majority of families of HIG purchased ghee on monthly basis. The <b>purchase</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> i. e. 15 kg was also correlated to the socio economic status and was prevalent in HIG families. Branded ghee was mostly preferred by HIG families where as in LIG families Homemade ghee was preferred. It was observed that choice for specified brands was 83. 4 % where as only 18. 9 % families were for no specific choice of branded ghee. Awareness related to Agmark certification on ghee was observed in majority of HIG families while awareness was lowest in LIG families. Amongst various food items ghee usage found highest score for chapati (88. 7 %, 76. 7 %, 93. 5 %) followed by sweets (38. 8 %, 58. 9 %, and 80. 4 %) in all three income groups LIG, MIG and HIG respectively...|$|E

40|$|We define Business-to-Business service firms as: {{advertising}} agencies, audit firms, investment banks, {{corporate law}} firms, and management consulting firms. These firms all share certain common characteristics: (i) their primary "asset" {{consists of the}} talent and reputation of their professional employees, (ii) compensation for their professional staff is a major cost of doing business, (iii) the services provided by the firms (unlike products) cannot be inventoried, and (iv) their services are marketed not to consumers, but to other institutions. A theoretical model is {{presented in this paper}} which explores vertical and horizontal differentiation in service industries. It is predicted that: B 2 B service firms will vertically differentiate in product quality; lesser (low) quality firms will horizontally differentiate in location (serving a local market), while superior (high) quality firms will horizontally agglomerate (serving clients nationally from a central location). In traditional consumer markets, we often find that larger purchasers are less quality conscious. For example, warehouse stores are oriented to provide relatively low quality service to retail clients who <b>purchase</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk.</b> In B 2 B service markets, however, we predict that large purchasers will purchase from high quality firms, and small purchasers will purchase from low quality firms. Lastly, as a corollary to this analysis, we predict that high quality firms will have different cost curves compared to low quality firms. This model is tested using approximately 100, 000 transactions from the Public Finance investment banking industry from 1986 - 1999. We find evidence of the predicted vertical differentiation, as well as clear evidence of horizontal agglomeration among the high quality firms, and horizontal differentiation among the low quality firms. Further, we find support for the proposition that high quality and low quality firms have different cost curves and different Minimum Efficient Scales (“MES”) of operation. This leads to the paradoxical outcome that the low quality firms can be operating at MES (for their quality level), while the high quality firms are still striving to achieve MES (although they are generally much larger than the low quality firms) even as both types of firms compete in the same general market. We test our predictions regarding MES by examining the size of the firms. For the low quality firms, we find that, by revenues, only 12 % of the firms are operating below MES. For the high quality firms, we find initially that more than 50 % of such firms are operating below MES. However, we find that over time approximately 80 % of the high quality firms operating below MES exit the industry. These findings have important implications for firms' marketing strategies. We suggest that, in many B 2 B service markets, we are likely to see the continued existence of many small low quality regional competitors, while an ever reduced number of large firms strive to reach sufficient size on a global and national basis. Indeed, we suggest that for firms aspiring to be high quality B 2 B service firms, size may well be the key strategic marketing variable.
