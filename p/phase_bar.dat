We present results that determine the critical dimension of a single <b>phase</b> <b>bar</b> for the generation of dislocations in the far-field. Using scalar theory, an analytical equality is derived that must be met by the structure. Because {{the size of the}} object is comparable to the wavelength, rigorous diffraction theory is used to find this feature size for a true object. Once the dislocations appear, their position is related strongly to the geometry of the object. We show theoretically and experimentally by using an interference microscope that, for a single <b>phase</b> <b>bar,</b> the distance between pairwise generated dislocations depends, to a good approximation, linearly on the width of the structure...|$|E

Azimuthal variations are visible during the whole <b>phase</b> of strong <b>bar</b> <b>phase,</b> and tend to disappear as the effect of radial migration diminishes, together with {{a reduction in the}} bar strength.

40|$|High-protein {{nutrition}} (HPN) bars (≥ 30 % protein) {{have limited}} shelf life and become excessively hard during storage. Various mechanisms {{have been proposed}} to explain the hardening. The objectives of this research were to investigate the chemistry of HPN bar hardening and propose solutions for slowing it and improving <b>bar</b> texture. In <b>phase</b> 1, HPN <b>bars</b> were made containing 34 % whey protein isolate (WPI) or milk protein concentrate (MPC) powder, along with either sorbitol syrup or glycerol, and vegetable shortening or cocoa butter. Substituting MPC for WPI made the bars brittle and crumbly. Using glycerol initially made bars softer but accelerated hardening. Cocoa butter increased bar hardness because of its higher solid to liquid content. Most water (~ 99 %) in HPN bars made using sorbitol syrup is present as bound water, with ~ 0. 9 % as intermediate water and ~ 0. 1 % as bulk water. During storage bound water increased ~ 0. 02 g/ 100 g of solids while intermediate water decreased, suggesting changes in state of water taking place at protein surfaces. During storage, there were changes in protein conformation indicated by an increase (~ 4 °C) in heat denaturation temperature of β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin and a 15 to 40 % decrease in denaturation enthalpy. In <b>phase</b> 2, various <b>bar</b> formulations were tested involving different proportions of proteins, lactose, glycerol, and sorbitol syrup, as well as type of lipid component, and disulfide bonds inhibition. Decreases in bar hardening occurred when MPC and WPI and sorbitol syrup and glycerol were used in combination. In <b>phase</b> 3, HPN <b>bars</b> made with 38 % protein powder as a 50 : 50 combinations of WPI and MPC and with 20 % of sorbitol syrup substituted with glycerol, had good texture and minimal hardening during storage. Bar hardening was not caused by phase separation of protein and sorbitol, Maillard browning, or formation of inter-molecular disulfide bonds. Minimizing bar hardening requires prevention of entropy-induced protein aggregation by masking hydrophobic regions on protein surfaces and preventing formation of extended protein networks. It is proposed that preferential exclusion of cosolvents causes glycerol to be oriented at protein surfaces such that its carbon backbone masks hydrophobic regions thus avoiding a decrease in entropy of water molecules.

40|$|Present in over 45 % {{of local}} spirals, boxy and peanut-shaped bulges are {{generally}} interpreted as edge-on bars and {{may represent a}} key <b>phase</b> in <b>bar</b> evolution. Aiming to test such claims, the kinematic properties of self-consistent 3 D N-body simulations of bar-unstable disks are studied. Using Gauss-Hermite polynomials to describe the major-axis stellar kinematics, a number of characteristic bar signatures are identified in edge-on disks: 1) a major-axis light profile with a quasi-exponential central peak and a plateau at moderate radii (Freeman Type II profile); 2) a “double-hump ” rotation curve; 3) a sometime flat central velocity dispersion peak with a plateau at moderate radii and occasional local central minimum and secondary peak; 4) an h 3 − V correlation over the projected bar length. All those kinematic features are spatially correlated and can easily be understood from the orbital structure of barred disks.

By using the chord criterion, we investigate the complete set of Goursat and Riemann problems which could arise as a result of dynamic interactions when we consider a piecewise linear elastic model corresponding to a three phase material. Subsequently we use our Riemann solvers to construct solutions for the longitudinal impact of two elastic <b>phase</b> transforming <b>bars</b> for a variety of impact conditions. We focus on the results which can be measured in laboratory experiments like the time of separation of the two bars after impact, the profile of the particle velocity at the rear end of the target and the stress history at the contact point.

Differences in the dimensions of the bars were related to the smaller transported volumes as the storage of sediment at lower foreshore decreased with each bar formation and migration. Intertidal bars presented the following behaviour: formation under low energy wave conditions and significant tidal ranges; stabilisation during neap tides and migration, by successive erosion/accretion series, under greater tidal ranges, while wave climate conditions experienced a progressive increasing; and welding to the beach forming a berm.

40|$|Abstract. The gas {{component}} {{plays a major}} role in the dynamics of spiral galaxies, because of its dissipative character, and its ability to exchange angular momentum with stars in the disk. Due to its small velocity dispersion, it triggers gravitational instabilities, and the corresponding non-axisymmetric patterns produce gravity torques, which mediate these angular momentum exchanges. When a srong bar pattern develops with the same pattern speed all over the disk, only gas inside corotation can flow towards the center. But strong bars are not long lived in presence of gas, and multiple-speed spiral patterns can develop between <b>bar</b> <b>phases,</b> and help the galaxy to accrete external gas flowing from cosmic filaments. The gas is then intermittently driven to the galaxy center, to form nuclear starbursts and fuel an active nucleus. The various time-scales of these gaseous flows are described...|$|R
40|$|Secular {{evolution}} and fueling {{is driven by}} bars in spiral galaxies, and the related dynamical processes are reviewed. It is shown that gravity torques dominate over viscous torques, and produce gas infall to the center. In this infall, the bar wave accepts the angular momentum, which produces its destruction. In the end, a central mass concentration is build, which also contributes to this destruction. While gas can be stalled at ILR for a while, secondary bars then take over the fueling. In a galaxy life-time, several bar episodes can successively develop. Through external gas accretion, disks are replenished by intermittence, between two <b>bar</b> <b>phases.</b> While the general trend for a galaxy is to evolve towards early-types, its morphology can oscillate, and turn back transiently to later-types.

These models are tested against those {{published in the}} literature in order to extend them and to include the gaseous component in the follow up paper. Specifically, {{we are interested in}} the angular momentum, J, redistribution in the disk-halo system during these two evolutionary phases without distinguishing between the resonant and non-resonant effects. We show explicitly that the DM halos play a dual role in the bar evolution: more centrally concentrated halos dilute the dynamical processes of the initial bar growth, such as the spontaneous bar instability and the vertical buckling instability, and slow down the J transfer, while facilitating it in the secular phase. The rate of J transfer in the disk and the halo is followed up in order to identify sites and times of peak activity in J emission and absorption. Within the corotation radius, Rcr, the disk J remains nearly constant in time, as long as Rcr stays within the disk — a sign that the lost angular momentum to the outer disk and the halo is being compensated by an influx of fresh J due to the outward motion of Rcr. We demonstrate that this is feasible as long as the bar slowdown dominates th...|$|R
