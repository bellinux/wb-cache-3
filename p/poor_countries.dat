5|$|Rowling has {{expanded}} the Harry Potter universe with several short books produced for various charities. In 2001, she released Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (a purported Hogwarts textbook) and Quidditch Through the Ages (a book Harry reads for fun). Proceeds {{from the sale}} of these two books benefited the charity Comic Relief. In 2007, Rowling composed seven handwritten copies of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a collection of fairy tales that is featured in the final novel, one of which was auctioned {{to raise money for the}} Children's High Level Group, a fund for mentally disabled children in <b>poor</b> <b>countries.</b> The book was published internationally on 4 December 2008. Rowling also wrote an 800-word prequel in 2008 as part of a fundraiser organised by the bookseller Waterstones. All three of these books contain extra information about the wizarding world not included in the original novels.|$|E

40|$|This study brings readers {{up to date}} on the {{complicated}} and controversial subject of debt relief for the <b>poorest</b> <b>countries</b> of the world. What has actually been achieved? Has debt relief provided truly additional resources to fight poverty? How will the design and timing of the "enhanced Heavily Indebted <b>Poor</b> <b>Country</b> (HIPC) initiative" affect the development prospects of the world's <b>poorest</b> <b>countries</b> and their people? The study then moves on to address several broader policy questions: Is debt relief a step toward more efficient and equitable government spending, building better institutions, and attracting productive private investment in the <b>poorest</b> <b>countries?</b> Who pays for debt relief? Is there a case for further relief? Most important, how can the case for debt relief be sustained in a broader effort to combat poverty in the <b>poorest</b> <b>countries?...</b>|$|R
3000|$|Income {{inequality}} between European {{countries will}} decrease {{less than in}} the past as the “convergence machine” seems to have halted; the differences in growth rates between richer and <b>poorer</b> <b>countries</b> seem to be less (OECD 2012), implying that the gap remains between richer and <b>poorer</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{trade in}} {{vertically}} differentiated goods between {{a rich and}} a <b>poor</b> <b>country.</b> In autarky two monopolists, selling a single product, operate in two countries which differ only for their per capita income. If trade opens, the firm operating in the <b>poor</b> <b>country</b> exports to the rich, giving rise to one-way trade. Consumers of the rich country and the firm of the <b>poor</b> <b>country</b> benefit from trade. Liberalization may hurt the consumers in the <b>poor</b> <b>country</b> if their per capita income is quite low vis à vis {{the one of the}} rich country. Trade in vertically differentiated goods brings about an overall gain if countries are quite far apart in terms of standard of living. Real wages increase in both countries as a result of trade, but relatively more in the rich country. As a remedy to the trade deficit, the rich country may set an import reducing tariff that, only under certain conditions, may benefit also the firm of the <b>poor</b> <b>country</b> and increase total welfare. ...|$|R

25|$|The U.S. Census Bureau view on {{the future}} of {{longevity}} is that life expectancy in the United States will be in the mid-80s by 2050 (up from 77.85 in 2006) and will top out eventually in the low 90s, barring major scientific advances that can change the rate of human aging itself, as opposed to merely treating the effects of aging as is done today. The Census Bureau also predicted that the United States would have 5.3 million people aged over 100 in 2100. The United Nations has also made projections far out into the future, up to 2300, at which point it projects that life expectancies in most developed countries will be between 100 and 106 years and still rising, though more and more slowly than before. These projections also suggest that life expectancies in <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> will still be less than those in rich countries in 2300, in some cases by as much as 20 years. The UN itself mentioned that gaps in life expectancy so far in the future may well not exist, especially since the exchange of technology between rich and <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> and the industrialization and development of <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> may cause their life expectancies to converge fully with those of rich countries long before that point, similarly to the way life expectancies between rich and <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> have already been converging over the last 60 years as better medicine, technology, and living conditions became accessible to many people in <b>poor</b> <b>countries.</b> The UN has warned that these projections are uncertain, and cautions that any change or advancement in medical technology could invalidate such projections.|$|E

25|$|Trade {{liberalization}} may shift economic inequality from {{a global}} to a domestic scale. When rich countries trade with <b>poor</b> <b>countries,</b> the low-skilled {{workers in the}} rich countries may see reduced wages {{as a result of}} the competition, while low-skilled workers in the <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper–Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from <b>poor</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of the Preston curve {{has been used by}} Lant Pritchett and Larry Summers to argue that <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> should focus on economic growth, and that health improvements will come about spontaneously as a result of increases in income. According to these authors, in 1990 better economic performance could have prevented {{more than half a million}} child deaths worldwide. However, the upward shifts of the Preston curve still imply that the main portion of gains in life expectancy has come about as a result of improved health technology rather than just increases in per capita income. Preston did, however, acknowledge that in the poorest countries economic growth may be necessary for improvements in health, as even the most inexpensive technologies have a cost of adoption that <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> may not be able to afford.|$|E

25|$|A further {{significant}} finding of Preston's {{study was that}} the curve has shifted upwards during the 20th century. This means that life expectancy has increased in most countries, independently of changes in income. Preston credited education, better technology, vaccinations, improved provision of public health services, oral rehydration therapy and better nutrition with these exogenous improvements in health. According to Preston, the independent increases in life expectancy have been greatest in the <b>poor</b> <b>countries,</b> although he also believed that {{a good portion of}} the potential gains from better medical technology have not been realized. Several <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa have actually seen declines in life expectancy in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, even if their per capita incomes have increased during this time.|$|E
