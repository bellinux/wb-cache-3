5000|$|The {{supply of}} follicles {{decreases}} slightly before birth, and to 180,000 by puberty {{for the average}} case (<b>populations</b> <b>at</b> puberty range from 25,000 to 1.5 million). By virtue of the [...] "inefficient" [...] nature of folliculogenesis (discussed later), only 400 of these follicles will ever reach the preovulatory stage.At menopause, only 1,000 follicles remain. It seems likely that early menopause occurs for women with low <b>populations</b> <b>at</b> birth, and late menopause occurs for women with high <b>populations</b> <b>at</b> birth, but there is as yet no clinical evidence for this.|$|R

5|$|In the Tang {{census of}} the year 754, there were 1,859 cities, 321 prefectures, and 1,538 {{counties}} throughout the empire. Although there were many large and prominent cities during the Tang, the rural and agrarian areas comprised the majority of China's <b>population</b> <b>at</b> some 80 to 90%.

The states of Guerrero and Hidalgo have the highest rates of monolingual Nahuatl speakers relative to the total Nahuatl speaking <b>population,</b> <b>at</b> 24.2% and 22.6%, respectively. For most other states the percentage of monolinguals among the speakers is less than 5%. This means that in most states more than 95% of the Nahuatl speaking population are bilingual in Spanish.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 57,000 {{visitors}} come to {{the park}} each year {{for a variety of}} outdoor recreational activities. The 1978 final rule listing Novisuccinea chittenangoensis as threatened estimated that 60 percent of the habitat at Chittenango Falls was trampled by humans. Human disturbance also continues to threaten Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, although this has been greatly minimized by fencing of the snail's habitat area at Chittenango Falls. The current strategy for recovering Novisuccinea chittenangoensis includes buffering the species against extinction by perpetuating the extant <b>population</b> <b>at</b> Chittenango Falls at a baseline size, and new attempts in maintaining multiple captive populations.|$|E

5|$|Assuming {{genetic drift}} {{is the only}} {{evolutionary}} force acting on an allele, {{at any given time}} the probability that an allele will eventually become fixed in the population is simply its frequency in the <b>population</b> <b>at</b> that time.

5|$|English (American English) is the {{de facto}} {{national}} language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English.
