40|$|Stern gear {{design for}} luxury high speed yachts {{currently}} relies on an {{estimation of the}} inflow velocity at the propeller plane and the propeller race. These components are often located within tunnel features on the hull and the flow regime will {{be influenced by the}} vessel trim and planning speed. Typically, the flow into the propeller is taken as an average over the entire propeller area and {{does not take into account}} the variation of the flow into the propeller due to appendages and hull shape. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations allow this variation to be calculated. These data are coupled with a potential based lifting surface program and are used to improve propeller design. In order to optimise the design of the rudder, the propeller race must be known. A method of introducing the propeller forces back into the CFD flow is investigated. This improved method has the advantage of providing a more accurate flow field into the rudder, which allows the rudder design to be improved. It is expected that this procedure will reduce the rudder drag and cavitation. The development and validation of this CFD methodology applied to high speed planning craft propulsion using open source software is illustrated with regard to two case studies for <b>P</b> <b>bracket</b> and propeller design optimisation, and to estimate the toe-in angle for the rudder in order to align it with the propeller race...|$|E

Sixty patients were assigned to two groups of thirty patients for each: one group received treatment with self-ligating brackets and the other with conventional ligated edgewise brackets. All patients were treated with extraction of the maxillary first premolars. The EARR of the maxillary central incisors was evaluated on the periapical radiographs and cephalograms, taken before and after orthodontic treatment. The GCF was also collected non-invasively from the mesial and distal sides of central incisors by using filter paper strips before and after orthodontic treatment. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were used to determine the IL- 6 levels in the GCF samples. A significant difference was found in the amount of EARR between the patients with self-ligating brackets and conventional brackets.

Aim: The study investigated the incidence of caries in an indigenous community from Central Brazil focusing on gender differences. Subjects and methods: The research was conducted among the Xavante Indians and was based on longitudinal data collected in two surveys (1999 and 2004). The study included 128 individuals, 63 (49. 2 %) males and 65 (50. 8 %) females, divided in four age brackets (6 - 12, 13 - 19, 20 - 34, 35 - 60 years of age). The DMFT (decayed, missing and filled teeth) index and incidences (difference between 1999 and 2004) were calculated for each individual. The proportion of incidence was also calculated. Differences in caries risk between gender and age brackets were compared by parametric and non-parametric tests. Results: There were statistically significant differences in relation to caries incidence between age brackets and gender. The greatest incidence was observed in the 20 - 34 age bracket, which presented 3. 30 new decayed teeth, twice {{the risk of the}} 6 - 12 age <b>bracket</b> (<b>p</b> 0. 01), chosen as reference.

40|$|AbstractChromatin {{boundary}} activities (BAs) {{were identified}} in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by genetic screening. Such BAs bound to sites flanking a reporter gene establish a nonsilenced domain within the silent mating-type locus HML. Interestingly, various proteins involved in nuclear-cytoplasmic traffic, such as exportins Cse 1 p, Mex 67 p, and Los 1 p, exhibit a robust BA. Genetic studies, immunolocalization, live imaging, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that these transport proteins block spreading of heterochromatin by physical tethering of the HML locus to the Nup 2 p receptor of the nuclear pore complex.

This interval, closely linked and distal to <b>p,</b> and <b>bracketed</b> by the genes encoding the alpha 5 and beta 3 subunits of the type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (Gabra 5 and Gabrb 3, respectively), contains a gene(s) (cp 1; cleft palate 1) necessary for normal palate development. The cp 1 interval extends from the distal breakpoint of the prenatally lethal p 83 FBFo deletion to the Gabrb 3 locus. Among 20 p deletions tested, there was complete concordance between alterations at the Gabrb 3 transcription unit and inability to complement the cleft-palate defect. These mapping data, along with previously described in vivo and in vitro teratological effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid or its agonists on palate development, suggest the possibility that a particular type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor that includes the beta 3 subunit may be necessary for normal palate development.

Three adhesives (ConTec LC, ConTec Duo and Transbond XT) and three curing units (Halogen light curing unit ConTec Light, plasma arc curing unit from ADT and LED light Elipar FreeLight) were employed in this study to detect potential influences of these parameters on shear bond strength, debond behaviour and failure site. 360 teeth (180 first upper bicuspids and 180 lower incisors) were stored in a 96 % ethanol-solution, and 360 teeth (180 first upper bicuspids and 180 lower incisors) were stored in a 0. 1 % thymol-solution. This total of 720 teeth were bonded one half each with Fascination and Fascination 2 brackets. Each tooth was etched for 60 seconds with a 37 % phosphoric acid solution (ConTec Etch).

METHODS: All brackets had a 0. 022 -inch slot; the orthodontic archwires were 0. 014 -inch Ni-Ti, 0. 016 -inch Ni-Ti, 0. 014 x 0. 025 -inch Ni-Ti, 0. 018 x 0. 025 -inch Ni-Ti, 0. 017 x 0. 025 -inch TMA, 0. 019 x 0. 025 -inch stainless steel, and 0. 019 x 0. 025 -inch Ni-Ti. Each bracket-archwire combination was tested 10 times. RESULTS: Coupled with 0. 014 -inch Ni-Ti and 0. 016 -inch Ni-Ti archwire, conventional brackets generated the greatest friction, while Damon MX and Vision LP brackets generated the lowest (P <. 05). No {{significant difference was}} observed between Time 3 brackets and Slide ligatures. Coupled with all the rectangular archwires, Victory Series brackets, Slide ligatures, and Vision LP self-ligating brackets generated significantly lower friction than Time 3 and Damon MX self-ligating <b>brackets</b> (<b>P</b> <. 05). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that self-ligating brackets are a great family of brackets that, in vitro, can generate different levels of friction when coupled with thin, thick, rectangular, or round archwires. Clinical conclusions based on our results are not possible, due to {{the limitations of the}} experimental conditions...|$|R
40|$|A bracket {{polynomial}} on the integers is {{a function}} formed using the operations of addition, multiplication and taking fractional parts. For a fairly large class of bracket polynomials we show that if <b>p</b> is a <b>bracket</b> polynomial of degree k- 1 on [N] then the function f defined by f(n) = e(p(n)) has Gowers U^k[N]-norm bounded away from zero, uniformly in N. We establish this result by first reducing it to a certain recurrence property of sets of bracket polynomials. Specifically, for a fairly large class of bracket polynomials we show that if p_ 1, [...] ., p_r are bracket polynomials then their values, modulo 1, are all close to zero on at least some constant proportion of the points 1, [...] ., N. The proofs rely on two deep results from the literature. The first is work of V. Bergelson and A. Leibman showing that an arbitrary bracket polynomial can be {{expressed in terms of}} a polynomial sequence on a nilmanifold. The second is a theorem of B. Green and T. Tao describing the quantitative distribution properties of such polynomial sequences. We give elementary alternative proofs of the first result, without reference to nilmanifolds, in certain "low-complexity" special cases. Comment: V 1 28 pages. V 2 31 pages.

40|$|Abstract Background Life {{satisfaction}} among {{residents of}} institutions {{is becoming an}} important issue in a rapidly aging population. The aim of this cross-sectional {{study was to investigate}} the links between life satisfaction and health-related behaviors amongst functionally independent elderly people who prefer institutional living in İstanbul, Turkey. Methods The socio-demographic characteristics, health-related behaviors, leisure-time activities and fall histories of 133 residents of an institution in Istanbul were assessed by a structured questionnaire during face-to-face interviews. A validated life-satisfaction index questionnaire (LSI-A) was completed. Results The mean age of the study group was 73. 9 ± 8. 0 (range 60 – 90 years). Within the group, 22. 6 % had never married and 14. 3 % had university degrees. The majority (71. 4 %) were in the low income bracket. The overall mean LSI-A score was 20. 3 ± 5. 9. Participants who declared moderate/high income levels had a significantly higher mean LSI-A score than those in the low-income <b>bracket</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 009). Multivariate analysis of the data suggested that leisure-time activities and participation in regular physical activities are significant predictors of LSI-A scores (R 2 : 0. 112; p = 0. 005 and p = 0. 02, respectively). Conclusion The findings imply that regular physical activity and leisure-time activities are significantly related to life satisfaction among residents in institutions. Participation in physical activity and leisure-time activity programs may help to improve the life satisfaction of elderly people living in institutions. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{identify}} {{the timing of}} significant arch dimensional increases during orthodontic alignment involving round and rectangular nickel-titanium (NiTi) wires and rectangular stainless steel (SS). A secondary aim was to compare the timing of changes occurring with conventional and self-ligating fixed appliance systems. METHODS In this non-primary publication, additional data from a multicenter randomised trial initially involving 96 patients, aged 16 years and above, were analysed. The main pre-specified outcome measures were the magnitude and timing of maxillary intercanine, interpremolar, and intermolar dimensions. Each participant underwent alignment with a standard Damon (Ormco, Orange, CA) wire sequence {{for a minimum of}} 34 weeks. Blinding of clinicians and patients was not possible; however, outcome assessors and data analysts were kept blind to the appliance type during data analysis. RESULTS Complete data were obtained from 71 subjects. Significant arch dimensional changes were observed relatively early in treatment. In particular, changes in maxillary inter-first and second premolar dimensions occurred after alignment with an 0. 014 in. NiTi wire (<b>P</b> 0. 05). <b>Bracket</b> type had no significant effect on the timing of the transverse dimensional changes. CONCLUSIONS Arch dimensional changes were found to occur relatively early in treatment, irrespective of the appliance type. Nickel-titanium wires may have a more profound effect on transverse dimensions than previously believed. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE On the basis of this research orthodontic expansion may occur relatively early in treatment. Nickel-titanium wires may have a more profound effect on transverse dimensions than previously believed...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{resistance}} to sliding of stainless steel passive self-ligating brackets with 0 ° and 2. 5 ° angulations and to compare them to active self-ligating brackets at zero angulation. The hypothesis to be tested was that passive self-ligating brackets produce lower frictional forces than active self-ligating brackets. METHODS: Twenty five 0. 022 x 0. 028 -in slot maxillary canine brackets were divided into 5 groups of 5 brackets: Damon SL II (Ormco, CA, USA) self-ligating bracket and Gemini (3 M/Unitek, CA, USA) conventional bracket with angulation of 0 and 2. 5 ° and a group of Speed 2 (American Orthodontics, WI, USA) active clip self-ligating system with zero angulation. Twenty five segments of stainless steel 0. 020 -in archwire (TP Orthodontics, IN, USA) were tested and each bracket/wire interface was evaluated at 4 successive points during sliding. Overall, 100 frictional values were analyzed by parametric analysis of variance and Bonferroni tests. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Frictional tests were performed with an Emic DL 10000 testing machine (Emic, Brazil) with a load cell of one kilogram. Passive self-ligating brackets produced lower frictional forces than active self-ligating <b>brackets</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 01). Under angulation, brackets with a slide mechanism produced higher friction than the same brackets under zero angulation (p < 0. 01). Nevertheless, the slide system under angulation produced smaller friction values than conventional brackets tied with elastomeric ligatures in 0 ° tests...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether {{repetitive}} opening and closure of self-ligating bracket clips can cause plastic deformation of the clip. METHODS: Three types of active/interactive ceramic self-ligating brackets (n = 20) were tested: In-Ovation C, Quicklear and WOW. A standardized controlled device performed 500 cycles of opening and closure movements of the bracket clip with proper instruments and techniques adapted as recommended by the manufacturer of each bracket type. Two tensile tests, one before and one after the repetitive cycles, were performed to assess the stiffness of the clips. To this end, a custom-made stainless steel 0. 40 x 0. 40 mm wire was inserted into the bracket slot and adapted to the universal testing machine (EMIC DL 2000), after which measurements were recorded. On the loading portion of the loading-unloading curve of clips, the slope fitted a first-degree equation curve to determine the stiffness/deflection rate of the clip. RESULTS: The results of plastic deformation showed no significant difference among bracket types before and after the 500 cycles of opening and closure (p = 0. 811). There were significant differences on stiffness among the three types of <b>brackets</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 005). The WOW bracket had higher mean values, whereas Quicklear bracket had lower values, regardless of the opening/closure cycle. CONCLUSION: Repetitive controlled opening and closure movements of the clip did not alter stiffness or cause plastic deformation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{purpose of}} this study was to assess four {{different}} self-ligating bracket designs to determine which has the most accurate slot dimensions in the 0. 022 ” dimension. Forty brackets of four different self-ligating bracket designs (Damon 3, Damon 3 MX, InOvation, Forestadent) were randomly selected. The brackets were measured at the slot height 2 times on each side, in the internal portion of the slot and in its most external portion using a Nikon Profile Projector model V- 16 D. The mean value of the slot height measurement at the internal portion was for Damon 3 brackets: 0. 02332 ” ± 0. 00030 ”; for Damon 3 MX, 0. 02305 ” ± 0. 00040 ”; for InOvation, 0. 02264 ” ± 0. 00032 ”, and for Forestadent, 0. 02341 ” ± 0. 00032 ”. At the height measurement in the outer portion of the slot, the mean value for Damon 3 was 0. 02333 ” ± 0. 00038 ”; for Damon 3 MX, 0. 02337 ” ± 0. 00044 ”; for InOvation, 0. 02295 ” ± 0. 00032 ”; and for Forestadent, 0. 02345 ” ± 0. 00025 ”. The slot walls in the Damon bracket were parallel and in the other three self-ligating bracket designs, they were divergent. The results showed that there were statistically significant differences in terms of internal and external slot dimensions of the four different designs of self-ligating <b>brackets</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|UCI rule 1. 3. 013 {{limits the}} forward {{displacement}} of {{the nose of the}} saddle to 5 cm rearward of the centre of the bottom-bracket. This study tests the effects of contravening this rule on 4 km laboratory time trials and highlights biomechanical and physiological responses that could be of interest to coaches and bike fitters. Ten competitive male cyclists age 26 ± 2 (mean±SD) yrs, height 180 ± 5 cm, body mass 71 ± 6 kg; V̇ O 2 max 70. 9 ± 8. 6 ml·kg- 1 ·min- 1) completed 4 km time trials and heavy intensity bouts. Riding posture was rotated forward where the nose of the saddle was 0, 2, 4, and 6 cm {{to the rear of the}} bottom <b>bracket</b> (<b>P</b> 0, P 2, P 4 and P 6). End time, power, cardiorespiratory responses, lower appendage kinematics and crank torque kinetics were measured. There was no significant effect of position on 4 km time trials completion time or power. During 4 km time trials and heavy intensity bouts, gas exchange variables and lower limb range of motion were unchanged (P> 0. 05). Trunk lean angle, cardiac output and stroke volume were greater at P 6 than other positions (P 0. 05). Results indicate, contravening rule 1. 3. 013 does not bring about improvements to 4 km laboratory TTs. The rearward shift in peak crank torque most likely occurs as a function of altered muscle activation. Haemodynamic variations are possibly related to changes in peripheral resistance at the most forward position. Further work is necessary to allude to probable improvements in aerodynamics...|$|R
