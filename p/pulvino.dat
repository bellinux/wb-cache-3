The island of Procida was originated by eruptive activity of five volcanoes; the partial immersion and landslides along the south eastern part of the oldest, gave rise to the island of Vivara (0 : 32 sq km), characterized by the peculiar half-moon configuration that draws the evolution of the ancient volcanic structure, completed ashore from the promontory of Santa Margherita, in the center of which grows the wonderful stretch of water called Gulf of Genito. The connection between Procida and Vivara is provided by a bridge built in 1957, the structure, typical of the viaducts, is made using a system of prefabricated beams resting on reinforced concrete <b>pulvinos</b> and columns in concrete, founded on a system of plinths on the seabed. The advanced state of deterioration had affected the load-bearing capacity; therefore it was necessary to prepare a recovery intervention and technological seismic upgrading who have restored the functionality.

5000|$|Risk {{arbitrage}} generates stable {{returns with}} minimal impact from market influences. In the long run, risk arbitrage {{does appear to}} generate stable returns. Baker and Savasoglu replicated a diversified risk arbitrage portfolio containing 1,901 mergers between 1981 and 1996; the portfolio generated excess annualized returns of 9.6%. Maheswaran and Yeoh examined the risk-adjusted profitability of merger arbitrage in Australia using a sample of 193 bids from January 1991 to April 2000; the portfolio returned 0.84% to 1.20% per month. Mitchell and <b>Pulvino</b> used a sample of 4,750 offers between 1963 and 1998 to characterize the risk and return in risk arbitrage; the portfolio generated annualized returns of 6.2%. The analyses also show that merger arbitrage is significantly constrained by transaction costs. Arbitrageurs could generate abnormally high returns using this strategy, but the frequency and high cost of trades negate most of the profits. In general, these examples {{support the notion that}} risk arbitrage generates steady returns over the long term. However, the arbitrageur must be aware of massive asymmetrical short-term losses that may arise when a deal is terminated. Individual deal spreads can widen to more than fifty percent in broken deals. The HFRI Merger Arbitrage Index posted a maximum one-month loss of -6.46% but a maximum one-month gain of only 2.90% from 1990 to 2005. Therefore, the arbitrageur must be able to stomach the occasional short-term pain to enjoy the long-term profits.|$|E

The model generates predictions for the responsiveness of the above three corporate financial decisions to cash flow shocks and firm misvaluation, {{as well as new}} predictions for the crosseffects of misvaluation on the cash flow sensitivities of these corporate policy variables. We test all these predictions based on a large sample of public firms in the U. S. and find consistent evidence. Overall, by confirming the model‟s predictions for the signs of cash flow sensitivities, misvaluation sensitivities and cross-sensitivities for a number of different misvaluation measures, our model provides strong support for the notion that the wedge between the cost of external and internal finance affects corporate policies. Our estimation method follows Gatchev, <b>Pulvino,</b> and Tarhan (2010) in that we employ a dynamic simultaneous-equation model which is subject to the constraint that sources must equal uses of cash.

40|$|Asset {{liquidation}} {{values are}} an important determinant of distress costs and therefore optimal capital structure. Capital structure theories typically assume liquidation values are exogenous {{even though they may}} be determined in part by the debt choices of firms in the industry (Shleifer and Vishny, 1992; <b>Pulvino,</b> 1998). We develop a model in which high industry debt leads to a greater supply of assets for sale by distressed firms but also lower demand for assets from relatively healthy firms because of debt overhang. Thus, high industry debt lowers expected asset liquidation values and provides an incentive for individual firms to take on less debt to take advantage of attractive future buying opportunities. The indirect effect of equilibrium asset prices tempers, and sometimes reverses, the effect of parameters on optimal capital structure choices compared to models with exogenous prices. For example, we show that firms may choose lower debt ratios when assets are more redeployable, contrary to standard intuition (Williamson, 1988). ∗We thank Sergei Davydenko, Barney Hartman-Glaser, Sebastian Gryglewicz and seminar participants a...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore methods to better {{quantify}} the risks associated with investing in hedge fund portfolios (a “fund of hedge funds”). More specifically, we measure the systematic and idiosyncratic risk of a sample hedge fund portfolio using eight different managers who invest across eight different trading styles/strategies. We employ two different measurement techniques, including Multivariate Regression analysis and Monte Carlo Value-at-Risk (VaR) to account for the volatility of returns and tail event risk, respectively. Our findings suggest that this two-step approach works well for hedge fund managers who follow a consistent strategy through time. Using this two-step approach resulted in increasing the predictive power of the regression and capturing non-linearity associated with hedge fund manager returns. Further research is needed to confirm these results using a larger sample of managers. Furthermore, future research is needed to identify ways to deal with manager who switch strategies or invest in multiple industries and asset classes.

40|$|As {{illustrated}} in the tale of “the dog that did not bark, ” the absence of news and the pure passage of time often contain information. We test whether markets fully incorporate the information content of “no news ” using the empirical context of mergers. Following the initial merger announcement, uncertainty relating to merger completion can take many months to be resolved. We find that the pure passage of time during this interim period is informative about the probability of merger completion. For example, once six months have passed after announcement, {{the probability that the}} merger will ever complete falls rapidly. We show that the variation in hazard rates of completion during the 12 months after announcement strongly predicts returns. This is consistent with a limited attention model in which markets underreact to the information content of the passage of time. We also show that our findings cannot be explained by event time variation in systematic risk, downside risk, or idiosyncratic risk. Specifically, we construct a trading strategy that invests in deals during event windows when completion hazard rates are high. Controlling for risk, our strategy outperforms a strategy that invests in deals when completion hazard rates are low by 100 basis points per month. ⇤We thank Mark Mitchell and Todd <b>Pulvino</b> for their detailed comments and generosity in sharing data.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} risk arbitrage in U. S. financial markets. The {{study by}} Mitchell, Mark and Todd <b>Pulvino</b> (2001) {{has been extended}} to study the U.

In particular, two research questions are pursued-(1) What are the effects of stock market, business conditions {{as well as the}} Merger and Acquisition Trend on risk arbitrage activities in the U. S (2) What is the current trend and effect of the U. S. financial regulatory mechanism on risk arbitrage? The results of the paper are: „X Returns associated with risk arbitrage are more pronouncedly decreased in down/severely depreciating stock market and business conditions especially when there is possibility of deal failure but remain rather uncorrelated with market returns when the market is flat and appreciating. „X The probability of a merger failing is a decreasing function of market returns in the last two months, indicating that deals are more likely to fail following market downturns. „X There has also been a growing trend in US financial market regulatory mechanism to reduce systemic risk, eliminate legal uncertainty and control regulatory and to have a closer look on derivatives trading which could be potentially used for fraud or manipulation. The current focus of the financial regulatory mechanism is to curb illegal trading in risk arbitrage activities through limits on trading volume and control of regulatory arbitrage opportunities which should continue into the future. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} hidden risks present {{within the}} hedge fund industry {{by focusing on}} two particular investment strategies. Quantitative long/short equity funds presented a new and interesting opportunity for risk assessment when many experienced massive losses over three days in August 2007. Following the approach of Khandani and Lo (2007), I employ a “contrarian ” trading model to replicate these returns and to better understand systematic risk within the strategy. In addition to a successful “robustness check ” on Khandani and Lo’s finding that the losses were most likely {{a result of the}} deleveraging of one or more large equity portfolios, I empirically justify a theory that contrarian returns are negatively related to market volatility, offer a new approach to estimating and analyzing leverage, and present a qualitative discussion of the hidden risks associated with portfolio overlap. Risk arbitrage, the second hedge fund strategy, is known to exhibit a non-linear and option-like risk and return profile. Utilizing the piecewise linear estimation model of Mitchell and <b>Pulvino</b> (2001), I find that returns of a particular merger arbitrage mutual fund and hedge fund index exhibit strong market correlation during down markets and little or no relationship during appreciating markets. Since this closely resembles a short position in an index put option, I adjust risk using a Black-Scholes replicating portfolio to find annual excess returns generated by risk arbitrage of about 4. 5 %. These conclusions, although useful in this context, cover just two hedge fund strategies. The intent is to emphasize the importance of alternative methods of risk assessment and to encourage further research into the topic of hidden risk. ...|$|E

Sandwith (Menispermaceae) conhecida como abuta ou abota, é uma planta {{medicinal}} amazônica utilizada contra doenças do aparelho reprodutor feminino, como antiinflamatório, antidiabético e outros. O estudo anatômico e etnofarmacológico de plantas medicinais são relevantes, pois visam esclarecer as propriedades, aplicações e usos terapêuticos dos vegetais. O objetivo deste trabalho foi obter informações etnofarmacológicas da abuta em Manaus e caracterizar anatomicamente os seus órgãos vegetativos. O material botânico foi coletado na Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke (Manaus-AM). O estudo etnofarmacológico foi realizado nos principais mercados e feiras de Manaus, através de entrevistas semi-estruturadas e abertas, com comerciantes e usuários de plantas medicinais. Para o estudo anatômico, amostras de folha, caule e raiz foram coletadas de 5 indivíduos de A. grandifolia. Amostras das lâminas foliares foram diafanizadas, dissociadas e também processadas para observação ao microscópio eletrônico de varredura (MEV), conforme metodologia usual. Fragmentos do caule e raiz foram incluídos em polietilenoglicol 2000 (PEG 2000), para obtenção de cortes em micrótomo de deslize, os quais foram corados com azul de astra e safranina, montados em Bálsamo do Canadá. Cortes frescos de caule e raiz foram submetidos a testes microquímicos, visando identificar substâncias químicas secretadas, assim como em cortes frescos da folha. Idiblastos secretores estão presentes na nervura central, pecíolo e <b>pulvino</b> das folhas de A. grandifolia. A raiz tem periderme, córtex parenquimático com células pétreas, feixes vasculares colaterais, formando um anel e cercados por esclerênquima, o parênquima radial com células de paredes espessas e lignificadas e medula ausente.

Sandwith (Menispermaceae) {{known as}} abuta or abota, is an Amazonian medicinal plant used against {{diseases of the}} feminine reproductive apparel, as anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and other. The ethnopharmacological and anatomical study of medicinal plants are relevant, to explain of they seek of because as properties, applications and therapeutic uses of the vegetables. The objective of this work was to obtain ethnopharmacological information of the abuta in Manaus and to characterize anatomically their vegetative organs. The botanical material was collected in the Forest Reservation Adolpho Ducke (Manaus-AM). The ethnopharmacological study was carried at the main markets and fairs of Manaus, through semi-structured interviews and open, with merchants and users of medicinal plants. For the anatomical study were collected samples of leaf, stem and root of 5 individuals of A. grandifolia. Samples of leaf lamina were cleared, dissociated and also processed for Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) view, following usual methodology. Fragments of the stem and root were included in polyethylenglycol 2000 (PEG 2000), for sectionings in a sliding microtome, stained with astra blue and safranina, mounted with Balm of Canada. Fresh cuts of stem and root were submitted to microchemical tests, to identify the chemical nature of the secreted compounds, {{as well as in}} fresh cuts of the leaf. Are present secretory sacs in pulvine, petiole and main vein. The root with periderm, parenchymatous cortex with stone cells, collateral vascular bundles, forming the ring and surrounded by sclerenchyma, radial parenchyma with cells of thick walls and lignified medulla is absent. The young stem possess epidermi with cells of thick walls and lignified, presents thick cuticle, parenchyma tous cortex with sclerenchymatous tissues, collateral vascular bundles surrounded by sclerenchymatous fibres, tylosis, radial parenchyma with lignified cells of thick walls and medular parenchyma. The epidermis of leaf lamina is uniseriate with lignified and thick walls cells, covered by cuticle, estomata in the lower limb surface; homogeneous mesophyll with collateral vascular bundles covered by sclerenchymatous hem. Petiole and pulvine with epidermis covered by cuticle layer thick, stone cells in the cortical parenchyma of pulvine and layers of fibers in the petiole, with larger number of layers in the pulvine; both with collateral vascular bundles surrounded by an arch of sclerenchymatous fibres. The microchemical tests confirmed starch in all of the studied organs; phenolic compounds in the secretory sacs of the leaf; pectin substances in the vessels of xylem of the stem and root and in the cells in sclerification process of the pulvine; alkaloid in the sclerenchymatous cells of the cortical parenchyma and in cells of the ray of the stem and the root, and lipids in the cuticle of the leaf and stem. In agreement with the ethnopharmacological informations obtained, the abuta little is known and used by the users of medicinal plants, it is marketed in nature, used mainly as anti-inflammatory, in the form of tea or infusion of their leaves and/or stem. The main users of the species are women. The merchants' knowledge regarding the medicinal plants is inherited of relatives or acquired through courses and specialized books.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a hidden}} {{aspect of a}} firm's capital structure {{through the use of}} a real options application. It is applied to the US airline industry, characterized by over levered balance sheets, and one which on some estimates, has made zero cumulative profit taking the years of the last century together. The paper introduces the notion of "financial flexibility", defined as the freedom (or flexibility) enjoyed by a conservatively geared firm to respond quickly and secure positive NPV projects, as opposed to an over levered firm. This "flexibility" is then valued as a real option using a model based on arithmetic Brownian motion involving a path dependant option pricing framework. It analyses the implications of debt financing in the US airline industry and develops a capital structure model that incorporates the value of "financial flexibility" enjoyed by conservatively geared carriers. This model essentially balances the quantified value of financial flexibility enjoyed by conservatively geared carriers against the relevant cost of obtaining this flexibility (i. e. the cost of carrying a sub optimal capital structure) and factors in the implications of "fire sales" (<b>Pulvino,</b> 1998) which is specific to the US airline industry. In its application to South West Airlines the paper concludes that the optimal capital structure, if the value of financial flexibility is incorporated - should move closer to the origin. A methodology of integrating the value of financial flexibility into the traditional theories of capital structure is proposed and demonstrated that (at least) in the US airline industry, failure to do so can result in a significant misstatement in a firm's value and its optimal capital structure. This paper makes two key contributions to the existing body of academic literature. The notion of valuing financial flexibility as a real option has been introduced previously by Beneda and Nelson (2003). However their quantification of the option value is through a standard Black Scholes equation where the underlying assumptions of this are not valid in quantifying a real option of this nature and this chapter makes a modification of the standard Black Scholes equation to reflect reality. Furthermore the paper applies the concept of financial flexibility specifically to the US airline industry and develops a conjecture on how this can be incorporated into the traditional theories of capital structure which is another contribution to the academic literature...|$|E
