40|$|The {{implementation}} of organizational and economic activities, {{the most important}} of which is the mechanism of state support, is ensured by high efficiency of land use while maintaining soil fertility. In order to adapt to the requirements of the WTO, the order of distribution and the provision of subsidies to decoupled support to farmers in crop production (<b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> <b>subsidies)</b> was introduced in Russia since the beginning of 2013. These payments are directed to the compensation of the costs for the purchase of fertilizers and plant protection chemicals, financing measures to improve soil fertility and soil quality. The order of <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> <b>subsidies</b> to farmers in specific subject of the Russian Federation is fixed on regional legislative level. In addition, each region has the right to establish its own criteria for budget allocation. The main conditions of the subsidy per hectare in the Krasnodar region are sown area under crops, the area sown to perennial grasses, and the area on which organic fertilizers have ever been put. This approach will contribute to the unjustified expansion of acreage by land users in the conditions of extensive production in violation of the science-based zonal technologies of field crops cultivation and, consequently, a violation of the process of soil fertility reproduction. In order to overcome the problem, the regional criteria for granting <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> <b>subsidies</b> are specified in the article. They include not only traditional terms but also the level of land use efficiency and its quality, which will promote economic entities in the area for more efficient implementation methods of soil fertility reproductio...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} stimulate organic farming governments {{generally}} use {{a mix of}} temporary hectare payments and provision of public services for stimulating {{the development of the}} organic sector. In this paper a conceptual model is developed for determining a socially optimal hectare payment for any given level of public services. Farm heterogeneity, due to the variability of soil quality and management skills, is explicitly taken into account. Using an n-th price auction mechanism farmers indicate what their reservation subsidy is for a given level of public input provision. The outcome of this problem is utilized in the government's optimization problem. We found that the level of <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> socially optimal <b>subsidy</b> increases significantly with the elasticity of the social welfare function and decreases significantly with the degree of farmers' heterogeneity in suitability of growing organic crops (OC) {{as well as with the}} level of complementary governmental services. The total area planted for OC is also quite sensitive to these parameters. The effects of the deadweight loss parameter and the degree of risk aversion on <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> <b>subsidy</b> and on total organic acreage are relatively small. auctions, organic farming, policy mix, Agricultural and Food Policy, Q 28, Q 12,...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the economic and environmental impacts of planting energy crop on set-aside acreages in Taiwan. To do so, a Taiwan Agricultural Sector Model (TASM) was built and the data parameters of energy crop were incorporated into this model in order to simulate the economic and environmental impacts. Simulation results show that GHGE mitigation depends on the planting acreage of energy crops in which the optimal planting acreage of energy is determined by the profit of other agricultural products as well as government subsidy on energy crop. Therefore, the mitigation of GHGE depends on the government subsidy on energy crop <b>per</b> <b>hectare.</b> Such <b>subsidy</b> is also suitable for the green box by the regulation of WTO.

40|$|The funds {{allocated}} to agriculture {{are a significant}} part of economic transfers. A large part of the EU budget is directed to agriculture, and the average amount of subsidies in the EU- 27 was, in 2013, approximately € 330 <b>per</b> <b>hectare.</b> Agriculture <b>subsidies</b> comprise about 60 % of total subsidies in the EU. Situation in Serbia is not as good as in the EU because the <b>subsidies</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> are three times lower, and a subsidy to agriculture stands slightly above 30 % of total subsidies, but with a tendency to increase over the past two years. This paper, through a comparative analysis of public expenditures for agriculture in Serbia and the EU countries (both developed countries and the countries in our immediate surroundings), shows the relevance and importance given to agriculture, due to its development opportunities. Serbian agriculture can be the engine of economic development and this is supported {{by the fact that the}} projection of expenditures for agriculture in the medium term has a tendency to rise...|$|R
40|$|Against the {{background}} of the Commission's CAP mid-term review proposals to complete the shift from product support to farmer support the Italian government announced strong opposition to any cuts in aid to durum wheat producers. Italy currently produces 3. 5 million tonnes of durum wheat per annum for which it receives € 345 <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> in <b>subsidies,</b> a total of € 552 million per annum. The mid-term review proposals call for a reduction in the special supplementary payments for durum wheat from 'traditional' areas (all of Italy's durum wheat-producing areas) to € 250 <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> over a three-year period (and its abolition in 'established areas'). The Italian Minister of Agriculture Gianni Alemanno maintained that this was 'a fundamental issue for Italy not only because the reform will cut Italy's share of the budget, but because it could lead to a transfer of durum wheat production, and related pasta production to other countries'. This he maintained 'would be intolerable'. Comment: The Commission maintains that reform of the durum wheat regime is necessary since each year 1 to 2 million tonnes of durum wheat are used in animal feed and not as an input into pasta production. A modification of the current specific supplementary payment regime is thus held to be essential. Furthermore the EU Court of Auditors has criticised the special supplementary payment system for over-compensating farmers. Italian concerns over durum wheat and pasta production may however be addressed through modification of the proposals for special payments for high quality durum wheat for manufacturing purposes. This would help to ensure the ready availability of durum wheat for pasta production. Italian pasta is increasingly appearing on supermarket shelves in southern Africa indicating that existing cereal sector reforms have already assisted in enhancing the price competitiveness of Italian pasta production on overseas markets.

In agricultural enterprises in 2009 the high costs of production {{on the one hand and}} low commodity prices on the other have assured profit only in sugar beet (€ 922 <b>per</b> <b>hectare)</b> and soybean production (€ 167 <b>per</b> <b>hectare),</b> while loss has been recorded in the production of maize (€ 206 <b>per</b> <b>hectare),</b> wheat (€ 121 <b>per</b> <b>hectare)</b> and sunflower (€ 162 <b>per</b> <b>hectare).</b> On family farms, the income achieved in the production of sugar beet (€ 924 <b>per</b> <b>hectare)</b> and soybean (€ 594 <b>per</b> <b>hectare)</b> provides the funds for further reproduction, but in maize (€ 105 <b>per</b> <b>hectare),</b> sunflower (€ 60 <b>per</b> <b>hectare)</b> and wheat production (€ 33 <b>per</b> <b>hectare)</b> it does not.
