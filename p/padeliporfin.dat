40|$|Background: Vascular-targeted {{photodynamic}} therapy, a novel tissue-preserving {{treatment for}} low-risk prostate cancer, has shown favourable {{safety and efficacy}} results in single-arm phase 1 and 2 studies. We compared this treatment with the standard of care, active surveillance, in men with low-risk prostate cancer in a phase 3 trial. Methods: This randomised controlled trial was done in 47 European university centres and community hospitals. Men with low-risk, localised prostate cancer (Gleason pattern 3) who had received no previous treatment were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (4 mg/kg <b>padeliporfin</b> intravenously over 10 min and optical fibres inserted into the prostate to cover the desired treatment zone and subsequent activation by laser light 753 nm with a fixed power of 150 mW/cm for 22 min 15 s) or active surveillance. Randomisation was done by a web-based allocation system stratified by centre with balanced blocks of two or four patients. Best practice for active surveillance {{at the time of}} study design was followed (ie, biopsy at 12 -month intervals and prostate-specific antigen measurement and digital rectal examination at 3 -month intervals). The co-primary endpoints were treatment failure (histological progression of cancer from low to moderate or high risk or death during 24 months' follow-up) and absence of definite cancer (absence of any histology result definitely positive for cancer at month 24). Analysis was by intention to treat. Treatment was open-label, but investigators assessing primary efficacy outcomes were masked to treatment allocation. This trial is registered with. ClinicalTrials. gov, number. NCT 01310894. Findings: Between March 8, 2011, and April 30, 2013, we randomly assigned 206 patients to vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy and 207 patients to active surveillance. Median follow-up was 24 months (IQR 24 - 25). The proportion of participants who had disease progression at month 24 was 58 (28 %) of 206 in the vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy group compared with 120 (58 %) of 207 in the active surveillance group (adjusted hazard ratio 0 · 34, 95 % CI 0 · 24 - 0 · 46; p< 0 · 0001). 101 (49 %) men in the vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy group had a negative prostate biopsy result at 24 months post treatment compared with 28 (14 %) men in the active surveillance group (adjusted risk ratio 3 · 67, 95 % CI 2 · 53 - 5 · 33; p< 0 · 0001). Vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy was well tolerated. The most common grade 3 - 4 adverse events were prostatitis (three [2 %] in the vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy group. vs one [< 1 %] in the active surveillance group), acute urinary retention (three [2 %]. vs one [< 1 %]) and erectile dysfunction (two [1 %]. vs three [1 %]). The most common serious adverse event in the vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy group was retention of urine (15 patients; severe in three); this event resolved within 2 months in all patients. The most common serious adverse event in the active surveillance group was myocardial infarction (three patients). Interpretation: <b>Padeliporfin</b> vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy is a safe, effective treatment for low-risk, localised prostate cancer. This treatment might allow more men to consider a tissue-preserving approach and defer or avoid radical therapy. Funding: Steba Biotech...|$|E
