Subsequently, a profile analyzer that utilizes data mining techniques is employed to select fitted users from the user profile database thus collected, and then feed the result back to the intelligent interface mechanism to improve the quality of the col-lected database profiles. In particular, questions used to reveal attributes can be pri-oritized based on an adjustable mechanism geared to the particular marketing objectives. To implement the proposed interactive questionnaire mechanism, we have made use of graphical questionnaire design tools, such as question editor, profile editor, and rule editor.

The capabilities of digital production color presses intrigue commercial printers the most, especially new units referred to by manufacturers as "Series II" or "third-generation" systems. Besides having more press-like characteristics, from offset-caliber quality, image consistency, and high output rates to sturdy construction, reliability, and stock choice, the units seem to represent a way to produce printing that’s beyond the norm.

However, today's Internet creates new business opportunities {{which seem to}} support the original EMH (e. g. Amazon bookshop).

Moreover, modern electronic markets appear not always to evolve along the predicted process (biased, unbiased, <b>personalized</b> <b>markets).</b> This article investigates former EMH-related research (Hess & Kemerer, 1994) and analyzes a few modern Internet business successes and failures, concluding that (1) the EMH-condition 'complexity of the product description' appears to be equivocal and (2) the degree to which ICT supports Ex-Ante actions (such as exchanging product and supplier information, advise, quotes and negotiating) seems to be an important discriminating factor between success and failure in electronic commerce (whether in markets or in hierarchies). Furthermore, it is shown that virtual communities, the evolution of which is not covered by the EMH, may play an important role as electronic markets too. It is shown that augmentation of the EMH can not solve the problems, and a new hypothesis, the Move to Ex-Ante hypothesis, is formulated. electronic markets; transaction costs; virtual communities. ...|$|R
