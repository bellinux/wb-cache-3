5|$|The {{pedosphere}} is {{the outermost}} layer of Earth's continental surface and {{is composed of}} soil and subject to soil formation processes. The total arable land is 10.9% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland. Close to 40% of Earth's land surface is used for cropland and pasture, or an estimated 1.3km2 of cropland and 3.4km2 of <b>pastureland.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} the {{fieldfare}} frequents mixed woodland of birch, alder, pine, spruce and fir, often near marshes, moorland or other open ground. It does not avoid {{the vicinity of}} humans and {{can be seen in}} cultivated areas, orchards, parks and gardens. It also inhabits open tundra and the slopes of hills above the tree line. In the winter, groups of fieldfares are chiefly found in open country, agricultural land, orchards and open woodland. They are nomadic, wandering wherever there is an abundance of berries and insects. Later in the year they move on to <b>pastureland</b> and cultivated fields.|$|E

5|$|Over 80% of Chad's {{population}} {{relies on}} subsistence farming and livestock raising for its livelihood. The crops grown and {{the locations of}} herds {{are determined by the}} local climate. In the southernmost 10% of the territory lies the nation's most fertile cropland, with rich yields of sorghum and millet. In the Sahel only the hardier varieties of millet grow, and these with much lower yields than in the south. On the other hand, the Sahel is ideal <b>pastureland</b> for large herds of commercial cattle and for goats, sheep, donkeys and horses. The Sahara's scattered oases support only some dates and legumes. Chad's cities face serious difficulties of municipal infrastructure; only 48% of urban residents have access to potable water and only 2% to basic sanitation.|$|E
5|$|In Florida, nesting {{habitats}} often {{consist of}} mangrove swamps, the shorelines of lakes and rivers, pinelands, seasonally flooded flatwoods, hardwood swamps, and open prairies and <b>pastureland</b> with scattered tall trees. Favored nesting trees in Florida are slash pines (Pinus elliottii), longleaf pines (P. palustris), loblolly pines (P. taeda) and cypress trees, {{but for the}} southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used. In Wyoming, groves of mature cottonwoods or tall pines found along streams and rivers are typical bald eagle nesting habitats. Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large, old-growth stands of ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa) to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland. In Southeast Alaska, Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) provided 78% of the nesting trees used by eagles, followed by hemlocks (Tsuga) at 20%. Increasingly, eagles nest in man-made reservoirs stocked with fish.|$|E

50|$|Animal Husbandry {{is the one}} of {{the major}} sources of {{livelihood}} in Rajasthan, and regulation of <b>pasturelands</b> is of utmost importance. In the pre-Independence era, Rajasthan was divided into small sub-states called Riyasats and each Riyasat was considered as a unit of development work. Villagers managed common lands without external intervention. Natural Resource Management was based on mutual agreement to follow a set of unwritten norms on animal grazing, penalty to encroachers etc. Under this system, there was control over cutting trees, encroaching on common land etc. But Post Independence, this system collapsed and the <b>pasturelands</b> came {{under the control of the}} village Panchayats. The Panchayats usually looked upon the village common lands as a source of income and did little to regulate use of the same. This led to malpractice and degradation of the <b>pasturelands.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{raising of}} livestock, unlike fishing, {{is a growing}} sector of the economy, often {{at the expense of}} agriculture. Many shallow lagoons {{formerly}} used for fishing have been drained for use as <b>pastureland.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} grazing {{practices}} that also encourage native biodiversity. In Rosenzweig’s book {{he uses the}} example of a rancher in Arizona who intentionally deepened his cattle ponds in order to save a population of threatened leopard frogs (Rana chiricahuensis), with no detriment to the use of those tanks for cattle, and a similar situation has occurred with the vulnerable California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) in the Central Valley of California. Research has shown that without cattle grazing, many of the remaining vernal pools would dry too early for the salamanders to complete their life cycle under global climate change predictions. In Central America, a large percentage of <b>pastureland</b> is fenced using live trees which are not only low maintenance for the farmer, but also provide habitat for birds, bats, and invertebrates which cannot persist in open <b>pastureland.</b> Another example from Rosenzweig involves encouraging loggerhead shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) to populate <b>pastureland</b> by placing perches around the pasture. These are all simple, low-cost ways to encourage biodiversity without negatively impacting the human uses of the landscape.|$|E

25|$|Since 2000, a {{significant}} number of developers have been converting former <b>pastureland</b> to high-end housing in the northern section of the city.

As the primus inter pares, Boqor Osman taxed the harvest of aromatic trees and pearl fishing along the seaboard. He retained prior rights on goods obtained from ship wrecks on the coast. The Sultanate also exerted authority over the control of woodland and <b>pastureland,</b> and imposed both land and stock taxes.|$|E

The area is noted for its fertile soil, excellent <b>pastureland,</b> and horse and stock farms. Poa pratensis (bluegrass) thrives on the limestone beneath the soil's surface, playing a major role in the development of champion horses; it is associated with the area's beauty of landscape. Numerous small creeks rise and flow into the Kentucky River.|$|E
25|$|In August 1945, the {{provisional}} government adopted the first sweeping agricultural reforms in Albania's history. The country's 100 largest landowners, who controlled {{close to a}} third of Albania's arable land, had frustrated all agricultural reform proposals before the war. The communists' reforms were aimed at squeezing large landowners out of business, winning peasant support, and increasing farm output to avert famine. The government annulled outstanding agricultural debts, granted peasants access to inexpensive water for irrigation, and nationalized forest and <b>pastureland.</b>|$|E
