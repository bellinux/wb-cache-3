He cited {{a line of}} cases dating {{back as far as}} 1886 to argue that a physical intrusion, or trespass, into a constitutionally-protected area – in an attempt to find something or to obtain information – was the basis, historically, for determining whether a [...] "search" [...] had occurred under the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. [...] Scalia conceded that in the years following Katz v. United States (1967) – in which electronic eavesdropping on a <b>public</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>booth</b> was held to be a search – the vast majority of search and seizure case law has shifted away from that approach founded on property rights, and towards an approach based on a person's [...] "expectation of privacy". However, he cited a number of post-Katz cases including Alderman v. United States and Soldal v. Cook County to argue that the trespassory approach had not been abandoned by the Court. In response to criticisms within Alito's concurrence, Scalia emphasized that the Fourth Amendment must provide, at a minimum, the level of protection as it did when it was adopted. [...] Furthermore, a trespassory test need not exclude a test of the expectation of privacy, which may be appropriate to consider in situations where there was no governmental trespass.|$|E

40|$|It {{all began}} with a comic book! At the age of 6, I was reading a Superman comic at my {{apartment}} in Manhattan when, in the centerfold, I found plans for building a crystal radio. To do so, I needed my father’s used razor blade, a piece of pencil lead, an empty toilet paper roll, and some wire, all of which I had no trouble obtaining. In addition, I needed an earphone, which I promptly appropriated from a <b>public</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>booth.</b> The one remaining part was something called a “variable capacitor. ” For this, I convinced my mother to take me on the subway down to Canal Street, the center for radio electronics. Upon arrival {{to one of the}} shops, I boldly walked up to the clerk and proudly asked to purchase a variable capacitor, whereupon the clerk replied with, “what size do you want? ” This blew my cover, and I confessed that I not only had no idea what size, but I also {{had no idea what the}} part was for in the first place. After explaining why I wanted one, the clerk sold me just what I needed. I built the crystal radio and was totally hooked when “free ” music came through the earphones—no batteries, no power, all free! An engineer was born, and the seeds for the Internet technology were sown. I spent the next few years cannibalizing discarded radios as I sharpened my electronics skills. I went to the legendary Bronx High School of Science and appended my studies with courses in radio engineering. When the time came to go to college, I found I could not afford to attend, even at the tuition-free City College of New York (CCNY), so I enrolled in their evening session program in electrical engineering while working full time as an electronics technician/engineer and bringing a solid paycheck home to my parents.
