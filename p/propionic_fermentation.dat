40|$|Dairy propionibacteria have {{recently}} been considered as probiotics which may beneficially modulate the intestinal ecosystem. However, appropriate vectors (food matrices containing the probiotic) which preserve their viability and offer good tolerance towards digestive stresses need to be developed. In addition, the development of efficient non-invasive methods which specifically monitor Propionibacterium freudenreichii concentration and activity within the human gut is required. To address this latter need, an enzyme involved in <b>propionic</b> <b>fermentation,</b> transcarboxylase, was evaluated in this study as molecular marker in P. freudenreichii. In vitro, the three transcarboxylase subunits were shown to be encoded by an operon and their expression regulated. It occurred during <b>propionic</b> <b>fermentation,</b> ceased in starved cells and was not affected by digestive stresses. The 5 S subunit gene of transcarboxylase allowed specific detection of P. freudenreichii by real time PCR in the complex human faecal microbiota. A dairy vector harbouring P. freudenreichii was developed and afforded elevated probiotic faecal concentrations in humans. In vivo, this PCR method allowed rapid quantification of faecal P. freudenreichii {{in agreement with the}} cultural method (cfu counting). Moreover, real time Reverse Transcription (RT) -PCR evidenced transcription of the 5 S subunit gene during transit through the human digestive tract. This work constitutes a methodological advance for survival and activity evaluation in human trials of the probiotics belonging to the P. freudenreichii species. It strongly suggests that this bacterium not only survives but remains metabolically active in the human gut...|$|E

To determine the applicability of the method to Montasio cheese (a Gouda or Emmental type), 2 experiments were carried out, in Oct. 1994 and May 1995, in which 2 batches of 48 experimental Montasio cheeses were conditioned traditionally at 11 °C/ 85 - 90 % RH for 30 or 60 days (Oct. samples) or 15 or 30 days (May samples) at 5 °C/ 85 % RH, and then transferred to traditional ripening stores. 2 batches of 47 cheeses incorporating 2. 5 g/quintal lysozyme served as controls. Analyses covered counts of total bacteria, somatic cells and Clostridium spores, incidence of abnormal fermentation and proteolysis, contents of butyric and propionic acids and sensory scores. Results indicated that conditioning at 5 °C for as little as 15 days controlled abnormal butyric and <b>propionic</b> <b>fermentation,</b> although this defect occurred in the controls.

To evaluate the possibility of screening this property in vitro, the production of both acids (referred to as methylbutyric acids) was compared for eight Propionibacterium freudenreichii strains both in mini-Swiss cheeses and in liquid cultures (salted-yeast extract-peptone-lactate medium, pH 5. 4, incubated at 24 °C then at 6 °C).

40|$|Abstract – Split and {{secondary}} fermentation defects in Swiss-type cheese varieties are manifested as undesirable slits or cracks {{that may lead}} to downgrading of the cheese. Split defect is associated with an excessive production of gas or an unsuitable cheese body that cannot accommodate gas produced, or a combination of both factors. Secondary fermentation is the apparent production of gas after the desired <b>propionic</b> <b>fermentation</b> of the warm room has taken place. No consensus exists as to the definitive causes of the defects, but possible causes are reviewed under factors that are associated with rheological behaviour (including cheese manufacture, acidification, intact protein content and proteolysis, seasonality of milk supply and ripening or storage temperature and duration) or with overproduction of gas (including milk microflora, propionic acid bacteria (PAB) – in particular strains with high aspartase activity and ability to grow at low temperatures, lactic acid bacteria, interactions between starter bacteria, facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli (FHL) and other sources of gas including butyric acid fermentation). The influence of other parameters such as copper concentration, air incorporation, salt content, rind formation and cheese wrapping materials is also considered. Methods to reduce the prevalence of the split defect {{and secondary}} fermentation include addition of water to improve elastic properties by the removal of unfermented carbohydrate and the use of FHL to control PAB activity to prevent the production of excessive gas...|$|E
40|$|The <b>propionic</b> acid <b>fermentation</b> {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{bacterial}} fermentations from which phospho-glyceric acid was isolated (Stone and Werkman, 1937) and shortly thereafter it was demonstrated that phosphoglycerate, hexosediphosphate and glycerol phosphate are fermented to the usual end products (Wood et al., 1938). It therefore has been considered that glucose is metabolized by these bacteria through the reactions of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas scheme (EMP 2). It also has been suggested that they possess a second path-way of glucose metabolism which is not inhibited by fluoride (Werkman et al., 1937; Wiggert and Werkman, 1939). However, Volk (1954) has presented evidence that the fluoride probably inhibited phosphatases and not enolase as had been assumed and that added phosphate esters are fermented only after they have been hy-drolyzed to the free acid, in which form they penetrate the cell. When labeled glucose became available it seemed possible that the occurrence of pathways other than the traditional EMP pathway might be detected by determination of the distribution of C 14 in the products of fermentation. Virtanen (1925) and Virtanen and Karstr 6 m (1931) have proposed that the <b>propionic</b> acid <b>fermentation</b> involves a cleavage to 2 - and 4 -carbon compounds and that succinate is formed from the latter.

Ten isolated strains were identified {{by a combination of}} SDS-PAGE, species-specific PCR and according to their ability to ferment lactose. They were all found to belong to the Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii species. Because of the stressing Gruyère technology, which includes cooking at 52 to 53 °C their thermotolerance was investigated at 55 °C. Thermotolerant and thermosensitive strains were clearly discriminated. Interestingly, the reference strain CIP 103027 belongs to the sensitive subset. One sensitive strain, ACA-DC 1305 and one tolerant, ACA-DC 1451, were selected for further study and compared to CIP 103027. For the sensitive strains ACA-DC 1305 and CIP 103027, heat pre-treatment at 42 °C conferred thermoprotection of cells at the lethal temperature of 55 °C, while there was less effect on the tolerant ACA-DC 1451. No cross-protection of salt-adapted cells against heat stress was observed for none of the strains. Differential proteomic analysis revealed distinct but overlapping cell responses to heat stress between sensitive and tolerant strains. Thermal adaptation upregulated typical HSPs involved in protein repair or turnover in the sensitive one. In the tolerant one, a distinct subset of proteins was overexpressed, whatever the temperature used, in addition to HSPs. This included enzymes involved in <b>propionic</b> <b>fermentation,</b> amino acid metabolism, oxidative stress remediation and nucleotide phosphorylation.

To investigate the P. freudenreichii strategies of adaptation and survival in the cold, we performed the first global gene expression profile for this species. The time-course transcriptomic response of P. freudenreichii CIRM-BIA 1 (T) strain was analyzed at five times of incubation, during growth at 30 °C then for 9 days at 4 °C, under conditions preventing nutrient starvation. Gene expression was also confirmed by RT-qPCR for 28 genes. In addition, proteomic experiments were carried out and the main metabolites were quantified. Microarray analysis revealed that 565 genes (25 % of the protein-coding sequences of P. freudenreichii genome) were differentially expressed during transition from 30 °C to 4 °C (P 1). At 4 °C, a general slowing down was observed for genes implicated in the cell machinery. On the contrary, P. freudenreichii CIRM-BIA 1 (T) strain over-expressed genes involved in lactate, alanine and serine conversion to pyruvate, in gluconeogenesis, and in glycogen synthesis. Interestingly, the expression of different genes involved in the formation of important cheese flavor compounds, remained unchanged at 4 °C.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between C. tyrobutyricum, C. sporogenes and C. beijerinckii in experimental cheese conditions, and their influences on late-blowing and butyric fermentation, have been investigated. A molecular approach using a PCR-TTGE method {{in combination with}} conventional methods, such as microbiological and physico-chemical analysis, was performed to monitor the evolution of these clostridial species, simultaneously with the occurrence of cheese defects. Sixteen Emmental type cheeses were produced from milk inoculated with different clostridial spore associations. In all cheeses inoculated with C. tyrobutyricum, obvious signs of late blowing were detected. In cheeses inoculated with C. beijerinckii or C. sporogenes, a formation of holes in cheese body was observed, with a concomitant slight amount of butyric acid production. Even though C. beijerinckii and C. sporogenes were less metabolically active and less numerically important than C. tyrobutyricum cheese as shown by TTGE profiles, the association of these species to C. tyrobutyricum enhanced the butyric fermentation and the cheese defects. The level of butyric content in ripened cheese increased to 268 mg 100 g(- 1) in presence of C. tyrobutyricum, and reached a maximum of 414 mg 100 g(- 1) in presence of the C. beijerinckii-C. tyrobutyricum (1 : 10) association.

Hydrogen yield and production rate, bacterial biomass and volatile fatty acids, including acetic, lactic and butyric acids, were measured. Key fermentation operation parameters, including concentration of carbon and nitrogen sources, growth temperature and pH, and inoculum size were investigated. The best results {{in terms of}} hydrogen yield and productivity were obtained under the conditions of 100 g/L molasses, 1. 2 g/L NH 4 NO 3, 39 °C at pH 6. 5 with initial cell concentration of 9 × 104 cell/ml. Maximum hydrogen yield was 1. 85 mol hydrogen/mol hexose, corresponding to a hydrogen production rate of 17. 38 mmol/h/L. Experimental data showed that the acetic/butyric acid ratio remained relatively stable {{with an increase in}} molasses concentration, while the unfavoured product, lactic acid, portion increased. No solvent (ethanol, butanol and acetone) was detected during the <b>fermentation.</b> <b>Propionic</b> acid was measured at a very low level in the hydrogen fermentation. Statistical analysis showed that hydrogen yield increased exponentially with the increase in cell growth, {{and that there was no}} correlation between the hydrogen yield and ratio of acetic acid to butyric acid.

40|$|Propionic acid is a {{carboxylic}} {{acid produced by fermentation}} and {{widely used in}} chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. It is used primarily for animal feed preservation, including hay, silage, and grains, and in human foods (mainly in baked goods and cheeses). The growing demand of this acid draws attention towards a more economical energy efficient technology. The conventional methods for the recovery of <b>propionic</b> acid from <b>fermentation</b> broth are expensive and unfriendly to the environment. Reactive extraction with specified extractant giving a higher distribution coefficient has been emerged as a promising technique for the recovery of acids. For the design of extraction process, equilibrium data of extractant is required to select a proper extractant for reactive extraction. In the present work equilibrium study for the reactive extraction of propionic acid is carried out. Various diluents and extractants are used for equilibrium studies and data are presented in terms of distribution coefficient and equilibrium complexation constant. On the basis of higher distribution coefficient and equilibrium complexation constant, the best combination of diluent extractant is suggested. In physical equilibria, distribution coefficient (KD = 2. 14) with 1 -octanol is maximum at concentration of 5 % (v/v). Distribution coefficient(K D = 2. 3) is enhanced with Aliquat 336 (10 %) in 1 -octanol for the reactive extraction of propionic acid. Presented data can be used for the design of reactive extraction process for the recovery of propionic acid...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} acetic or <b>propionic</b> acid rumen <b>fermentation</b> {{patterns}} on whole-body protein turnover, tissue protein synthetic rates and body composition {{was investigated in}} growing lambs. Protein turnover was assessed using a continuous intravenous infusion of [2, 3 -³H]tyrosine and tissue protein fractional synthetic rates (FSR) from the specific activities of plasma free, intracellular free and tissue bound tyrosine. Only the FSR of muscle tissue approached significance. The high FSR in the propionic group was attributed to the high plasma insulin concentration. Values for whole-body protein synthesis, corrected for tyrosine oxidation, {{were similar to those}} obtained by summating protein synthesis in individual tissues, confirming that tyrosine oxidation should be measured accurately if reliable whole-body protein synthesis values are required. Tyrosine oxidation and flux were high in the acetic acid group, suggesting that amino acids are used for gluconeogenesis. The high protein turnover rate probably ensures an adequate supply of gluconeogenic amino acids and that the penalty of mobilizing body proteins for gluconeogenic amino acids is minimal. In the propionic acid group, high plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were associated with a low protein turnover rate, high ratio of deposited: synthesized protein and a high body fat content. It is concluded that changing the proportion of ruminal volatile fatty acids influences protein turnover, protein synthesis and the efficiency of protein retention. Such factors probably contribute, indirectly, to the observed differences in body composition...|$|R
40|$|The best {{available}} external carbon source {{to enhance the}} short-cut nitrification-denitrification (SCND) and denitrifying phosphorus removal via nitrite (DPRN) was investigated using a demonstration sequencing batch reactor (SBR) to treat anaerobic supernatant. The SBR was inoculated with conventional activated sludge and fed with liquid effluent from anaerobic co-digestion of waste activated sludge and organic fraction of municipal solid waste. After the 20 day-long start-up, a stable and reliable via-nitrite pathway was achieved. Then, five {{best available}} carbon sources (acetic acid, glycerol, organic fraction of the municipal solid waste (OFMSW) fresh drainage liquid, OFMSW fermentation liquid, cattle manure and maize silage (CM&MS) fermentation liquid) were investigated. Glycerol did not cause major enhancement on nutrients removal. On the other hand, we found specific denitritation rates in the range 0. 51 - 1. 16 kgNO 2 -NkgVSS - 1 day - 1 for OFMSW and CM&MS related carbon sources. Specific consumptions were 2. 1 - 2. 3 kgCODkgNO 2 -Nrem- 1 for acetic acid and glycerol respectively, while OFMSW and CM&MS involved higher ratios 2. 7 - 3. 1 kgCODkgNO 2 -Nrem- 1. Thanks {{to the presence of}} Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), namely butyric and <b>propionic</b> acids, the <b>fermentation</b> liquids contemporary enhanced the DPRN up to 0. 81 kgPO 4 -PuptakenkgNO 2 -Nremoved- 1. Thanks to the use of biowaste material, the cost of the external carbon source can be lower than 0. 1 €kgCOD - 1 when OFMSW is fermented. Therefore, the total specific cost for nitrogen removal may decrease of 22 % when the OFMSW fermentation liquid is used instead of methanol. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|Production of <b>propionic</b> acid by <b>fermentation</b> of propionibacteria {{has gained}} {{increasing}} attention {{in the past few}} years. However, biomanufacturing of propionic acid cannot compete with the current oxo-petrochemical synthesis process due to its well-established infrastructure, low oil prices and the high downstream purification costs of microbial production. Strain improvement to increase propionic acid yield is the best alternative to reduce downstream purification costs. The recent generation of genome-scale models for a number of Propionibacterium species facilitates the rational design of metabolic engineering strategies and provides a new opportunity to explore the metabolic potential of the Wood-Werkman cycle. Previous strategies for strain improvement have individually targeted acid tolerance, rate of propionate production or minimisation of by-products. Here we used the P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii and the pan-Propionibacterium genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to simultaneously target these combined issues. This was achieved by focussing on strategies which yield higher energies and directly suppress acetate formation. Using P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii, two strategies were assessed. The first tested the ability to manipulate the redox balance to favour propionate production by over-expressing the first two enzymes of the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP), Zwf (glucose- 6 -phosphate 1 -dehydrogenase) and Pgl (6 -phosphogluconolactonase). Results showed a 4 -fold increase in propionate to acetate ratio during the exponential growth phase. Secondly, the ability to enhance the energy yield from propionate production by over-expressing an ATP-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and sodium-pumping methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MMD) was tested, which extended the exponential growth phase. Together, these strategies demonstrate that in silico design strategies are predictive and can be used to reduce by-product formation in Propionibacterium. We also describe the benefit of carbon dioxide to propionibacteria growth, substrate conversion and propionate yield...|$|R
