40|$|Gene-specific {{oligonucleotide}} <b>probes</b> {{are currently}} used in microarrays to avoid cross-hybridization of highly similar sequences. We developed {{an approach to}} determine the optimal number and length of gene-specific <b>probes</b> for accurate transcriptional profiling studies. The study surveyed <b>probe</b> lengths from 25 to 1000 nt. Long <b>probes</b> yield better signal intensity than short <b>probes.</b> The signal intensity of short <b>probes</b> can be improved by addition of spacers or using higher <b>probe</b> concentration for spotting. We also found that accurate gene expression measurement can be achieved with multiple <b>probes</b> per gene and fewer <b>probes</b> are needed if longer <b>probes</b> rather than shorter <b>probes</b> are used. Based on theoretical considerations that were confirmed experimentally, our results showed that 150 mer is the optimal <b>probe</b> length for expression measurement. Gene-specific <b>probes</b> can be identified using a computational approach for 150 mer <b>probes</b> {{and they can be}} treated like long cDNA <b>probes</b> in terms of the hybridization reaction for high sensitivity detection. Our experimental data also show that <b>probes</b> which do not generate good signal intensity give erroneous expression ratio measurement results. To use microarray <b>probes</b> without experimental validation, gene-specific <b>probes</b> ∼ 150 mer in length are necessary. However, shorter oligonucleotide <b>probes</b> also work well in gene expression analysis if the <b>probes</b> are validated by experimental selection or if multiple <b>probes</b> per gene are used for expression measurement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Probing is a {{promising}} approach for network monitoring. An important problem {{that needs to}} be addressed while developing probing-based solutions is the selection of <b>probe</b> station nodes. <b>Probe</b> station nodes are the nodes that are instrumented with the functionality of sending <b>probes</b> and analyz-ing <b>probe</b> results. The placement of <b>probe</b> stations affects the diagnosis capability of the <b>probes</b> sent by the <b>probe</b> stations. The <b>probe</b> station placement also involves the overhead of instrumentation. Thus it is important to minimize the required number of <b>probe</b> stations without compromising on the required diagnosis capability of the <b>probes.</b> In this paper, we present a novel reduction of the Minimum <b>Probe</b> Station Selection problem to the Minimum Hitting Set problem.

40|$|We have {{developed}} novel <b>probe</b> systems for real-time PCR that provide higher specificity, greater sensitivity, and lower cost relative to dual-labeled <b>probes.</b> The seven DNA Detection Switch (DDS) -probe systems reported here employ two interacting polynucleotide components: a fluorescently labeled <b>probe</b> and a quencher antiprobe. High-fidelity detection is achieved with three DDS designs: two internal <b>probes</b> (internal DDS and Flip <b>probes)</b> and a primer <b>probe</b> (ZIPR <b>probe),</b> wherein each <b>probe</b> {{is combined with}} a carefully engineered, slightly mismatched, error-checking antiprobe.

Other designs (Universal <b>probe,</b> Half-Universal <b>probe,</b> and MacMan <b>probe)</b> use generic components that enable low-cost detection. Finally, single-molecule G-Force <b>probes</b> employ guanine-mediated fluorescent quenching by forming a hairpin between adjacent C-rich and G-rich sequences.

The division made a stand at Minqar Qaim and was surrounded by German forces on 27 June. As the Germans <b>probed</b> the perimeter of the New Zealand positions, Freyberg was wounded. Inglis assumed temporary command of the division and successfully led it in an outbreak from Minqar Qaim that night.

5|$|Amy Dudley's death {{caused a}} scandal. Despite the inquest's outcome, Robert Dudley was widely {{suspected}} to have orchestrated his wife's demise, a view {{not shared by}} most modern historians. He remained Elizabeth's closest favourite, but with respect to her reputation she could not risk a marriage with him. A tradition that Sir Richard Verney, a follower of Robert Dudley, organized Amy Dudley's violent death evolved early, and Leicester's Commonwealth, a notorious and influential libel of 1584 against Robert Dudley, by then Earl of Leicester, perpetuated this version of events. Interest in Amy Robsart's fate was rekindled in the 19th century by Walter Scott's novel, Kenilworth. The most widely accepted modern explanations of her death have been breast cancer and suicide, although a few historians have <b>probed</b> murder scenarios. The medical evidence of the coroner's report, which was found in 2008, is compatible with accident as well as suicide and other violence.|$|E

5|$|Cracked tooth {{syndrome}} {{refers to}} a highly variable set of pain-sensitivity symptoms that may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure, or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth. The term is falling into disfavor and {{has given way to}} the more generalized description of fractures and cracks of the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth can involve the enamel, dentin, and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including dentin hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, there is no single test or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it's highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be <b>probed</b> or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when facing them).|$|E
5|$|In May 1173 Louis and the Young King <b>probed</b> the defences of the Vexin, {{the main}} {{route to the}} Norman capital, Rouen; armies invaded from Flanders and Blois, {{attempting}} a pincer movement, while rebels from Brittany invaded from the west. Henry secretly travelled back to England to order an offensive on the rebels, and on his return counter-attacked Louis's army, massacring many of them and pushing them back across the border. An army was dispatched to drive back the Brittany rebels, whom Henry then pursued, surprised and captured. Henry offered to negotiate with his sons, but these discussions at Gisors soon broke down. Meanwhile, the fighting in England proved evenly balanced until a royal army defeated a superior force of rebel and Flemish reinforcements in September {{in the battle of}} Fornham near Fornham in East Anglia. Henry took advantage of this respite to crush the rebel strongholds in Touraine, securing the strategically important route through his empire.

5|$|Measurements of the {{interaction}} between energetic photons and hadrons show that {{the interaction}} is much more intense than expected by the interaction of merely photons with the hadron's electric charge. Furthermore, the interaction of energetic photons with protons is similar to the interaction of photons with neutrons {{in spite of the fact}} that the electric charge structures of protons and neutrons are substantially different. A theory called Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) was developed to explain this effect. According to VMD, the photon is a superposition of the pure electromagnetic photon which interacts only with electric charges and vector meson. However, if experimentally <b>probed</b> at very short distances, the intrinsic structure of the photon is recognized as a flux of quark and gluon components, quasi-free according to asymptotic freedom in QCD and described by the photon structure function.
