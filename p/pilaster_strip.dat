50|$|In the Middle Ages {{the church}} was {{dedicated}} to St Olaf. The chancel and nave from the late Romanesque period were built in brick on a profiled plinth with <b>pilaster</b> <b>strips</b> on the corners. The chancel's <b>pilaster</b> <b>strips</b> now only remain on its southwest corner. Originally {{there was also an}} apse which was torn down but later replaced during the restoration work in 1861 by the Hamburg architect Ernst Heinrich Glüer. On that occasion, the south door was bricked up but the door frame remains. The tower is from the Late Gothic period.|$|R
50|$|The {{village has}} two churches, the Methodist Church and the Church of St. Andrew. St. Andrew's {{is one of}} 124 {{existing}} round-tower churches in Norfolk. The plan {{of the church is}} beguilingly irregular, with the chancel decreasing in width towards the east end. A <b>pilaster</b> <b>strip</b> in the south wall of the chancel curiously tapers with the narrow portion at the bottom: the whole building has a gnarled, irregular appearance which is a mark of Anglo-Saxon construction. Even the corners (quoins) are of flint, although these are somewhat larger on the whole than those built into the body of the walls. There is even, surprisingly, an attempt at herringbone-work, all in flint, and round splayed porthole windows dressed entirely in flints, not quite perfect circles.|$|E
50|$|Santa Croce: {{founded in}} 1080, outside the walls under the {{patronage}} of Pope Gregorius VII; after town expanded, rebuilt by Tibaldi in 1596. Repairs in 1960s altered decoration. In the <b>pilaster</b> <b>strip</b> dividing 1st and 2nd chapels is an indentation in Carrara marble {{said to be}} a footprint of the Christ retrieved from the Holy Land during the Crusades. The 3rd chapel on the right hosts a Adoration of the Magi (1533) by Bernardino Lanino. The 4th chapel houses a Saint Michael by Guglielmo Caccia (Il Moncalvo). In the counterfaçade there are two watercolours (1545) depict a Virgin of Annunciation and Archangel Gabriel, attributed to Vigevanese Bernardino Ferrari. The 4th chapel on the left houses a Virgin with Child and Saints by the 16th-century Venetian school and a 15th-century fresco representing Saint Augustin.|$|E
5000|$|The tower shows typical {{features}} of Saxon architecture: walls of rendered rubble, with decorative <b>pilaster</b> <b>strip</b> work, and {{long and short}} work. [...] The pilasters do not provide any possible support—some are only very shallowly set into the wall. They are cut from Roman ashlars. [...] Oak beams survive at two levels in the tower; these would originally have supported higher floors. The first floor {{must have been a}} gallery, as there are no windows at ground floor level. [...] The tower has only a few, small, windows, with either round or triangular heads, and they are divided by a shaft. There are north and south doorways, which appear to have originally possessed timber porches. The roof would have been of timber construction, probably of stepped pyramidal form, and covered with shingles.|$|E
50|$|The façade, {{built in}} 1460-1464, has sloping sides {{and is in}} brickwork, divided in three parts by two <b>pilasters</b> <b>strips.</b> The two side {{sections}} have quadruple mullioned windows, while the central has a large rose window. The portal is surmounted by a pointed arch with white stone decorations portraying, on the summit, St. Christopher, the Madonna and the Archangel Gabriel by Nicolò di Giovanni Fiorentino and Antonio Rizzo. Under is a tympanum, in porphyry, supported by circular <b>pilaster</b> <b>strips.</b> The whole is included into a porch with Corinthian columns.|$|R
50|$|The {{rear area}} is {{characterized}} by three high apses, the central only slightly larger. Only the northern one has maintained the original decoration with <b>pilaster</b> <b>strips</b> and small arches.|$|R
50|$|Interior {{details are}} {{generally}} classical with dentilled ceiling moldings, <b>pilaster</b> <b>strips,</b> and frieze. Each room has a uniquely designed parquet floor. Various Craftsmen, and Art Moderne details {{can also be}} found in the house.|$|R
5000|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} in flint rubble with stone dressings. The walls have been rendered and colourwashed. The roof is tiled. [...] Its plan is simple, {{consisting of a}} nave and a chancel in a single range, with a weatherboarded bellcote at the west end. At the east end, within the former chancel arch, is a three-light square-headed window, and above this are two lancet windows. In the north wall of the chancel is a 12th-century single-light window. To the west {{of this is a}} blocked door dating from the same period. Also in the north wall is a Saxon <b>pilaster</b> <b>strip</b> made in Binstead stone from the Isle of Wight. In the south wall of the chancel is a 13th-century lancet window. To the west of this are two single-light square-headed windows. Between these is a Norman round-headed doorway. The west window dates from the 14th century and has two lights with trefoil heads, and there is a quatrefoil window above it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{church at}} the site was founded in 1080, outside {{the walls of the}} village under the patronage of Pope Gregory VII. With the expansion of the town, the church was rebuilt in 1596 using designs of Pellegrino Tibaldi. One of the holy relics of the church is putatively a foot print of Christ, though made of Carrara marble, and, according to the tradition, dating back to the period of the Crusades. It is located between two of the chapels on a <b>pilaster</b> <b>strip.</b> In the third chapel on the right there is a canvas depicting the Adoration of Magi (1533) by Bernardino Lanino. In the fourth chapel, the altarpiece depicting St Michael defeating Satan by Guglielmo Caccia, also called Il Moncalvo. In the counterfacade there are two tempera canvases (1545) depicting Our Lady of the Annunciation and Archangel Gabriel, attributed to the Vigevanese painter Bernardino Ferrari. The fourth chapel on the left exhibits a Virgin and Child and Saints by the 16th-century Venetian school and a 15th-century fresco representing St Augustine ...|$|E
50|$|Goodnestone House is a Grade II* listed red {{and blue}} brick palladian house, enlisted on 13 October 1952. The {{original}} house, as built in 1704, was a two-storey building. However, significant alterations were made around 1790 when a 3rd floor was added with plinth, plat band and cornice to the hipped roof with stacks to left and to right. Between 1838 and 1844 further changes {{were made by the}} partnership of Thomas Rickman and R.C. Hussey and by Sir Brook Bridges, 5th Baronet. The house has nine bays, the central 5th bay projecting with pediment. On the top floor are nine half-sized glazing bar sashes on top floor, and 6 full sized on the first and ground floors. The grand porch features Greek Doric columns, with solid side walls, adding during the development phase in the early 1840s. The original entrance to the house was on its eastern side. The eastern side also features 9 bays with glazing bar sashes and heavy stone surrounds with the protruding central 5th bay emblazoned with arms of Sir Brook Bridges in 1842. To the northern side there are 2 storeys with an attic with plinth, plat band and parapet to hipped roof, with 3 pedimented dormers and rear stack. On both the northern and southern side of the house is a large <b>pilaster</b> <b>strip</b> buttress and shallow canted bay.|$|E
50|$|Characteristic {{features}} are the ornate portal and decorative gable; the façade has <b>pilaster</b> <b>strips</b> which accentuates vertical divisions. Bay windows are divided with loggias. This building is {{the seat of}} the Honorary consulate of Czech Republic.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} {{follows the}} Pisane Romanesque style established by Buscheto. It has a nave and two aisles with apses. The façade is articulated by <b>pilaster</b> <b>strips,</b> blind arches, oculi (small circular windows), lozenges and mullioned windows.|$|R
50|$|The apse, chancel and nave {{are built}} of brick in the Late Romanesque style on a double sloping plinth with <b>pilaster</b> <b>strips</b> {{at the corners}} and {{saw-toothed}} cornices at the top. The apse {{is divided into three}} sections with narrow <b>pilaster</b> <b>strips.</b> The bevelled window to the east has been opened up and the two others reconstructed in 1911 when the church was restored. On the south wall, a small, sharply pointed and slightly projecting priest's door can be seen. The south door is still in use but has been significantly transformed. The north door has been bricked up. The tower and porch were added in the Gothic period.|$|R

40|$|U radu se razmatraju tri ulomka ranokršćanske skulpture iz Novalje, pronađena na mjestu nekadašnje velike ranokršćanske bazilike posvećene sv. Mariji u Novalji na otoku Pagu. Ulomci se sada nalaze u lokalnoj zbirci Stomorica a riječ je o ulomcima pluteja i sarkofaga. Ulomci pluteja ukrašeni su ranokršćanskim motivima squami i rombova a dosad nije bilo uočeno da pripadaju istoj oltarnoj ogradi. Na ulomku sarkofaga preostala je zanimljiva dekoracija koju čini traka s bršljanovom viticom i tragovima razdijeInog pilastra i kapitel. Dosad se smatralo da je taj ulomak također pripadao ranokršćanskom pluteju, ali pomnijom analizom utvrđeno je da je zapravo riječ o gornjem rubu sarkofaga arhitektonskog tipa kakvi su pronađeni u Aquileji i Novigradu a i inače bili su rašireni na području gornjeg Jadrana. Twenty {{years ago}} A. Šonje {{published}} several Early Christian reliefs in his paper on Late Antique {{art and architecture}} {{on the island of}} Pag. In this often cited paper, A. Šonje gathered all the information he was able to find in the scholarly literature as well as the results of his own archeological research. The Late Antique sites coincide with the settlements on {{the northern part of the}} island of Pag such as Novalja, Stara Novalja and Caska which occupies the location of the Roman Cissa. However, the Early Christian phase was discovered only in Novalja which boasts as much as three Early Christian churches — two cemeterial ones at Jaz and Gaj, and the large basilica within the walls that was most probably dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Among the scattered finds unearthed accidentally on the site of the long destructed basilica of St Mary in the 1950 s, A. Šonje mentions a couple of interesting Early Christian reliefs and believes that both of them belonged to two different fifth-century screen slabs, one of them even made of marble. The supposedly marble fragment is decorated with scales or squamae, as they were called, while the other fragment published by A. Šonje as the fragment of a different screen slab, is ornamented with a vegetaI motif with ivy leaves and a small <b>pilaster</b> <b>strip</b> carrying a leaved capital. After a more careful analysis undertaken in the local collection Stomorica, where these reliefs are kept today, it became clear that the marble fragment mentioned by A. Šonje is actually made of limestone. In addition, a very similar fragment housed in the collection, decorated with a lozenge pattern, seems to belong to the same altar screen, which has been unnoticed before. The fragment decorated with the ivy and the <b>pilaster</b> <b>strip,</b> on the other hand, surely did not belong to an Early Christian screen slab firstly because contemporary screen slabs never had such a decoration and secondly, because identical decoration has been attested elsewhere, on the Early Christian sarcophagi of the architectural type. The closest parallels can be found at Aquileia and Novigrad, where the same vegetal motif with ivy leaves and the same shallow pilaster strips with leaved capitals decorate the sides of the two sarcophagi already attributed to the same workshop. Although it was suggested by F. Ciliberto that the Aquileian sarcophagus might be of the fourth-century date, the fragments from Novalja and Novigrad probably belong to a later date, that of the 5 th century, due to the overall archeological contexts of these two places. Such an interpretation of these Early Christian reliefs, found on the site of the basilica of St Mary at Novalja, sheds a different light on the interior decoration of the basilica itself. Unlike A. Šonje had thought, the basilica did not have a marble altar screen but a limestone one decorated with squamae and lozenges, and it did not have two dissmilar screens at the same time, as he had believed, since the fragment with the vegetaI motif he had published as an altar screen fragment has proven to be a fragment of the architectural sarcophagus, the kind of which had been produced at Aquileia and popular throughout the northern Adriatic basin...|$|E

50|$|The bell tower, in brickwork, was {{finished}} in 1503. It has a square plan, with <b>pilasters</b> <b>strips</b> {{on the sides}} leading to the cell with circular mullioned windows. Four semicircular tympani divided the cell from the upper cylindrical tambour with an onion dome in Eastern style.|$|R
50|$|The exterior, made {{of stone}} of {{different}} provenance, is marked by <b>pilaster</b> <b>strips</b> and arches over which are precious ceramic basins (the originals are in the National Museum of St Matthew in Pisa) of Islamic, Majorca and Sicilian manufacture decorated with geometrical and figurative motifs (10th-11th centuries).|$|R
50|$|The façade, {{finished}} in 1653, is mostly in brickwork, with two superimposed orders divided by <b>pilaster</b> <b>strips.</b> The interior {{is on the}} Greek Cross plan, surmounted by an octagonal dome with a lantern. Decoration is attributed to the Nasini family. The crypt, a suggestive 16th century hall, contains the contrada's museum.|$|R
50|$|Along the facade, the {{horizontal}} lines (the stringcourses, for instance) give the buildings a longitudinal appearance, while the vertical lines (<b>pilaster</b> <b>strips</b> and avant-corpses) create interruptions. Through the harmonisation of the lines, the structural elements take up an architectural character. The {{main body of}} the facades, from the base to the superstructure, shows unity and dimensional value.|$|R
50|$|The storeys {{are divided}} by {{projecting}} stone string courses, and at each successive storey, the walls become slightly thinner, creating a step at each string course. The vertical <b>pilaster</b> <b>strips</b> continue up the tower, and are interspersed with stone strip arches at lower level and triangular decoration at upper level, {{in some instances}} resulting in a criss-cross pattern.|$|R
50|$|The façade {{features}} <b>pilaster</b> <b>strips,</b> blind arches and lozenges, and {{is decorated}} with 12th century intarsia.The interior houses the panels of Madonna with Child (by Matteo Traini, 14th century) and of St. Nicholas Saving Pisa from the Plague (15th century), canvases by Giovanni Stefano Marucelli and Giovanni Biliverti, a Crucifix by Giovanni Pisano, a Madonna with Child by Nino Pisano and an Annunciation by Francesco di Valdambrino.|$|R

50|$|The oratory {{was built}} {{at the site of}} a Romanesque church {{commissioned}} by the then ruler of Bologna Giovanni II Bentivoglio. It was frescoed starting in 1505 by series of Renaissance painters associated with the Bentivoglio court, including Francesco Francia, Lorenzo Costa and Amico Aspertini. The frescoes cover the walls flanking the oratory entrance. In ten panels, divided by <b>pilaster</b> <b>strips</b> in decorated grotteschi, scenes from the life of Saint Cecilia and her husband Valerianus are described.|$|R
50|$|The west facade {{is divided}} into five levels. The most eye {{catching}} stylistic element is a huge round window, surrounded by eight small rosettes, which forms a clear centre of the west facade. The rosette symbolises the four Evangelists. Despite the symmetry of the twin-towers, there is rich variation in forms and building elements, e.g. round and pointed arches, <b>pilaster</b> <b>strips,</b> small pillars, archivolts, windows and blind arches. The upper level of the north tower includes gothic elements (e.g. window tracery).|$|R
5000|$|The blind arcading {{is purely}} decorative, since the arches and triangles spring from string courses rather than {{supporting}} them. In fact Warwick Rodwell {{has suggested that}} the [...] "hopeless jumble" [...] of the arcading at Earls Barton demonstrates it was mere ornament. Rodwell suggests that the design was based on timber framing but that the parts were then assembled wrongly. The position of openings in the tower makes use of this decoration by fitting within the triangles and <b>pilaster</b> <b>strips.</b>|$|R
