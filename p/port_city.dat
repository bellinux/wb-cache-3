40|$|Abstract Over {{the past}} 50 years, {{containerization}} has both enabled and reflected {{the articulation of}} increasingly concentrated and complex global trade flows. Once close infrastructural, economic and institutional ties between seaports and <b>port</b> <b>cities</b> have been loosened, since major ports now serve producers and consumers in widely dispersed hinter-lands. This process has been especially intense in North America, where west coast ports serve markets across the continent. At the same time, many of the external costs of increased port activity are incurred in <b>port</b> <b>cities.</b> Hence, questions about {{the changing nature of}} employment in port and related goods-handling sectors have become increasingly important for understanding the share of economic benefits received by <b>port</b> <b>cities.</b> This paper focuses on the effects of containerization, and related changes in transportation regulation, on port-logistics worker earnings in major United States <b>port</b> <b>cities</b> since 1975. A difference-in-differences framework is used to examine the relative annual earnings of dock, truck-ing and warehouse workers in major container <b>port</b> <b>cities.</b> The analysis shows that, with notable excep-tions, port-logistics worker earnings in major container ports are not necessarily higher than those of comparable workers. The findings provide further insights into the strained relationship between sea-ports and <b>port</b> <b>cities</b> in the era of containerization and economic globalization...|$|R

40|$|Romania is crossed {{through by}} the Danube, the main European river course, the Romanian <b>port</b> <b>cities</b> being an {{important}} item of the European river network. Ports as Galati, Tulcea, Giurgiu {{are part of}} the Pan-European Corridor IV, assuring the Eastern link for the merchandises entering Europe through some of the main ports as Rotterdam, Wien, Mainz or Strasbourg. Their strategic location is offering the Romanian ports the opportunity of becoming the main gate for the water traffic between Asia and Occident.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{continental}} {{approach to the}} combination of transport functions within European <b>port</b> <b>cities.</b> It reviews a number of concepts and theories, regarding with transport chain integration and urban centrality {{in the case of}} ports. While many studies on intermodalism face a lack of quantifiable data, this research proposes an original methodology based on employment. The data is collected for 76 <b>port</b> <b>cities,</b> 9, 000 companies and more than one million employees in all transport modes. By bringing together employment figures and basic urban and port indicators, results of the factor analysis show the different functional and spatial trends. There is a recurrent opposition between freight and passenger-oriented specializations among <b>port</b> <b>cities,</b> which are also influenced by the European core-periphery spatial pattern. In addition, a benchmarking of <b>port</b> <b>cities</b> in terms of their intermodal potentials is provided as a means for policy implications...|$|R
