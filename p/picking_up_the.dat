5|$|Prior to Atlus <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> title, Vanillaware had {{encountered}} difficulties finding a publisher due to Kamitani's sparse {{record as a}} developer. Completed in 2006, Odin Sphere was delayed into the following year so it would not compete with Atlus' own titles. The localization was handled by Atlus USA, and proved challenging in multiple areas. Upon release, it garnered a positive reception from video game journalists: praise was given to its story, visuals and old-school gameplay, with criticism focused on its inventory system and framerate issues. Leifthrasir was praised for its improved performance and reworked mechanics. The game was a commercial success, contributing {{to the rise of}} Vanillaware as a developer.|$|E

There, Dr. Baker has been working on Eve, a more docile clone of Sil. Madsen and Helgenberger reprised their roles, while Henstridge played Eve. Species II was received by critics worse than the first film, garnering a 9% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, and Madsen denounced it as a terrible film. The film's director, Peter Medak, attributed the failure of the film to not <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> infected rat ending of the original film.

5|$|By January 2011, {{much of the}} nation's {{attention}} {{had shifted}} from the Gascoyne flood to the devastating floods in Queensland. Many residents struggling to get their lives back together were frustrated {{with the government and}} demanded aid. Though people affected by the floods were to be given A$15,000 in funds, they expressed further anger after hearing that residents in Queensland would receive A$25,000. On 11 January, Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that the imbalance in funds was to be corrected and residents of Western Australia would receive equal amounts to those in Queensland. By 20 January, donations for flood victims from the Lord Mayor's Distress Relief Fund exceeded A$1million. Power restoration, especially in Gascoyne Junction, was unusually sluggish. Dozens of residents were without power for eight weeks, as electricity was finally restored between 12 and 13 February. This coincided with the arrival of replacement furniture from Paraburdoo; however, heavy rains renewed flooding and prevented most residents from <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> supplies.|$|E

5|$|Development {{began in}} 2006 {{following}} {{the completion of}} Jump Ultimate Stars as Ganbarion's first original title.

5|$|Prior to {{the first}} half, Chelsea {{continued}} to dominate possession and round-up more opportunities – the ball was given to Wise, after cooperation between Petrescu and Vialli, whose shot went just across the left goal. It did not take long, before Granville generated another endeavor for Chelsea to make Wohlfahrt throw himself to the right {{in order to prevent}} the shot. The club made its first substitute change in the 71st minute, which saw Flo being replaced by Zola. He made an effect immediately, <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ball after a well-timed pass by Wise, and finishing with a half volley in the penalty box, past Wohlfahrt, which found its way straight in the top right corner. As the match went on, Petrescu was sent off for an illegal tackle on Yakin. It did not affect Chelsea as Stuttgart failed to produce anything to turn the final in their favour. Stuttgart's situation proved worse when they were also reduced to ten men, as Poschner was dismissed after quarrels with referee Braschi.|$|E
