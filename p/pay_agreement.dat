25|$|Several episodes {{received}} {{extremely high}} audience figures, especially the first series. This was {{partly due to}} the fact that the main rival channel to BBC One channel in the UK, ITV, was in the middle of a long protracted strike which started in early August 1979, which saw nearly all of the local ITV companies go off air and no programmes being aired from the network (except Channel Television in the Channel Island), leaving only BBC One and BBC Two as the channels left for the British public to watch until Wednesday 24th October 1979 when ITV returned to air, with the strike ending in a <b>pay</b> <b>agreement.</b> However many viewers remained with the BBC and shows such as To The Manor Born, as ITV took some months to get going again with new programmes. For the first month after the strike had ended, ITV found it hard to win back viewers who preferred to remain with the BBC, as ITV was airing repeats and filler programmes until new content was made from November 1979. This gave To The Manor Born a huge advantage with the viewing public. In 1979, the last episode of the first series received 23.95 million viewers, the fourth-highest figures for any programme in the UK in the 1970s, and the highest for a non-live event. The following year, 21.55 million people watched the last episode of series two, the fifth-highest viewing figure for the 1980s. The final episode in 1981, when Audrey and Richard marry, received 17.80 million viewers. The 2007 Christmas special garnered 10.25 million viewers and ranked as the 6th most watched programme in the UK for that week.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} wage and price setting {{behaviour}} of Lithuanian firms {{on the basis}} of an ad hoc survey “On Price and Wage Setting” undertaken by the Bank of Lithuania. The paper provides survey evidence on the frequency of wage and price changes. The frequency of wage changes turns out to be higher in firms that apply collective <b>pay</b> <b>agreements,</b> while the frequency of price changes appears to be positively affected by the market competition. Labour cost share is not found to be significant in making the impact on the frequency of price changes. This paper also investigates the role of certain technological, institutional and other factors in shaping firms’ responses to a negative demand shock, an intermediate input cost shock and a wage shock. A higher labour cost share is found to increase the likelihood of a price increase following a wage shock. Flexible wage components mitigate firms’ responses to a slowdown in demand and an intermediate input cost increase. The behaviour of firms following the investigated shocks is also affected by the level of competition. The role of collective <b>pay</b> <b>agreements</b> appears to be rather limited in shaping responses of firms to the shocks.

30|$|Furthermore, we {{find that}} the {{probability}} of applying for short-time work significantly increases with the shares of both full-time and part-time permanent contracts vis-à-vis fixed-term contracts (the reference group in the regression), a result also reported for German establishments by Boeri and Bruecker (2011) and Crimmann et al. (2010). However, unlike these two studies, we also find that in Luxembourg, firms are more likely to apply for STW if they are bound by collective <b>pay</b> <b>agreements.</b> Taken together, we interpret this as a sign that firms with less flexible contractual arrangements are more constrained in carrying out adjustments through the extensive margin and therefore more likely to apply for short-time work. This is also consistent with the probability of applying for short-time work being lower among multi-establishment firms or firms with a lower share of permanent employees, indicators that can be interpreted as mirroring the internal flexibility of such firms.|$|R

In the organizations studied, there was evidence of winners and losers within and between organizations, flow-on effects on other groups of nurses not represented by the union and on other employee groups. Although impacts on public sector nursing workforces were generally positive, some imbalances and unintended consequences arose from the agreement.

30|$|Using {{the same}} dataset, Crimmann et al. (2010) {{turn to the}} {{question}} of firm selection into short-time work, or the extensive margin of participation. They find that, unlike in 2003, firms taking up short-time work in 2009 were less likely to have high shares of qualified or university-trained employees. They point to the specific nature of the 2008 – 2009 recession as a possible explanation, since it hit exporting manufacturing firms particularly hard and presumably these had large shares of non-specialised, blue-collar workers. Most of their other evidence also confirms Boeri and Bruecker’s (2011) findings on the intensive margin of take-up. These include a positive effect of establishment size and deteriorating performance (past profitability, future expectations) on the likelihood of using short-time work. In addition, flexible arrangements, such as part-time, fixed-term and agency contracts, tend to reduce the probability of participation. Exporting establishments {{are also more likely to}} participate in short-time work, even after controlling for other factors. Finally, they find no significant impact from the application of collective <b>pay</b> <b>agreements.</b>|$|R
30|$|Next, in {{line with}} the {{descriptive}} results shown in Table  2, foreign-owned firms seem to be affected less by rises in the minimum wage and are less likely to find any of the adjustment channels relevant, especially the prices, non-labour costs and productivity channels. Institutional features of the labour market, {{such as the use of}} a collective <b>pay</b> <b>agreement,</b> tend to increase the relevance of certain adjustment channels, but only in the full country sample (Table  6). The significance is mainly driven by the strong effect in Hungary and Romania. Binding terms in collective agreements can pose additional restrictions on activity and force firms to compensate for rises in the minimum wage by raising prices and cutting non-labour costs and employment in these countries. However, if all the channels are included in the estimation, and so the sample is restricted to the Baltic countries and Poland (Table  5), the marginal effect of collective agreements becomes statistically insignificant.|$|E
30|$|Firm size {{is taken}} into account through the dummy {{variables}} indicating the size class. The base category is firms employing 1 – 4 employees, complemented by classes for 5 – 19, 20 – 49, 50 – 199 and 200 +[*]employees. Since we expect that collective pay agreements might matter, we also include a dummy variable if a collective <b>pay</b> <b>agreement</b> of any kind (firm-level or outside the firm) was applied in 2013. Further, firm-specific variables include the share of permanent full-time employees and the share of permanent part-time employees in 2007. The share of fixed-term/temporary employees {{in that same year}} serves as base category. Multi-establishment firms can shift work and employees between plants, so we expect them to be less likely to be applying for short-time work. Firing costs for permanent employees, full-time or part-time, are expected to be higher than for temporary workers or agency workers. To maintain their firm-specific human-capital, firms with higher shares of employees with at least 5 years of tenure are expected to be more likely to apply for short-time work. Firms with more skilled employees and firms reporting hiring costs to be relevant obstacles to hiring new employees are also expected to be more likely to apply for short-time work.|$|E
30|$|While using nonstandard work {{arrangements}} {{employers are}} confronted with a trade-off because {{they need to take}} into account costs and benefits of certain work arrangements (Houseman 2001; Sesselmeier 2007). Direct wages, additional costs for social security and costs of hiring and firing need to be weighed against the workers’ productivity. Nonstandard work usually has certain (cost) advantages compared to other alternatives in this respect. Firstly, {{it can be used to}} safe labour costs. This might, e.g., be the case if a firm employs agency workers which are not covered by its particular <b>pay</b> <b>agreement.</b> Secondly, nonstandard work arrangements may also lead to lower labour costs for regular workers because extra payments to regular workers for overtime might not be necessary to the same extent. Thirdly, particularly fixed-term contracts and temporary agency work reduce costs of hiring and firing. Such an option is of particular relevance in an institutional framework in which dismissal protection legislation applying to standard workers is comparatively strict. The different types of temporary employment can be used as a recruiting device and may therefore increase the efficiency of matching labour supply and demand (Osterman and Burton 2005; Boockmann and Hagen 2008). Fourthly, nonstandard work arrangements offer more flexibility to adapt available personal resources to variations in product demand (Bentolila and Saint-Paul 1992; Nunziata and Staffolani 2007; Nienhüser 2008; Picchio 2012). And finally nonstandard work arrangements can be seen as a kind of buffer to protect core workers. In doing so, firms can combine both the advantages of internal labour markets and flexible labour (Alewell 1993; Osterman and Burton 2005; Pfeifer 2009).|$|E
30|$|Short-time work in Luxembourg is {{concentrated}} in the manufacturing sector, in which 1.5 % to 4.9 % of total jobs were saved through short-time work, {{depending on the size}} class and period. The likelihood that a Luxembourg firm applied for or used short-time work is higher for single establishment firms and firms reporting negative impact of demand volatility/uncertainty and customers’ ability to pay on their activity. In addition, the likelihood of the use of short-time work increases with the share of permanent employees and the degree of export orientation. Taken at face value, the results suggest that STW is primarily requested and used by firms facing demand fluctuations or uncertainty rather than a demand level shock. Furthermore, STW is used by firms with high levels of firm-specific human capital and firms constrained by collective <b>pay</b> <b>agreements,</b> and thereby helps to avoid costly and inefficient separations of employees. Altogether, this suggests that, in Luxembourg, STW is used as intended; we do not find evidence pointing towards STW use impeding structural adjustments to lasting negative demand shocks.|$|R
