40|$|The {{mechanism}} for the photo-Fries rearrangement of phenyl acetate and biphenylyl acetates were reinvestigat-ed in <b>phenol</b> (<b>or</b> <b>phenol</b> derivatives) containing media. The {{results showed that the}} <b>phenol</b> (<b>or</b> <b>phenol</b> deriva-tives) which is the most common by-product of Fries reaction reacts with acyl radical to give Fries-product. These <b>phenol</b> (<b>or</b> <b>phenol</b> derivatives) contributions to the Fries-products were suggested as the Trivial mecha-nism for the photo-Fries reaction...|$|R

50|$|The ideal {{concentration}} for {{the manufacture}} of disinfectants is a phenol content of 15% on the product. In this way, when the disinfectant is prepared for use, it will always have a final concentration of phenols higher than 1%, which is used for cleaning and disinfection.For the preparation of phenol disinfectants, liquid soaps of different types are used which aid in cleaning and, mainly, the solubility of the active substance (<b>phenols</b> <b>or</b> cresols).It has been standard practice to use soaps which, upon dissolving the finished product in water, give a white, milk-like emulsion. This emulsion contains, dissolved in small particles, the active material, whether <b>phenols</b> <b>or</b> cresols.|$|R
30|$|Nitroso dyes are {{prepared}} by nitrosation {{of the appropriate}} <b>phenol</b> <b>or</b> naphthol. They are generally metal complex derivatives of o-nitrosophenols or naphthols. Nitroso dyes are polygenetic because they form differently colored complexes with different metals. They have good light fastness.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{synthesis}} of useful enantiomerically pure arylglycinates via spontaneous reaction between phe-nol or naphthol derivatives and enantiopurea-imino glyoxylate {{in the absence}} of an acid catalyst is reported. A library of enantiopure substituted <b>phenol</b> <b>or</b> naphthol glycinates was obtained in good yields and high diastereoselectivities. Diastereoisomerically pure aryl glycinates were obtained by direct flash chromatography separation of the crude reaction mixture. The free OH moiety of the <b>phenols</b> <b>or</b> naph-thols contributed to the activation of the imino group to form an intermolecular hydrogen bond and pro-moted the reaction {{in the absence of}} an acid catalyst, as shown in the transition state reported. The diastereoselectivity is due to thermodynamic control in the addition step...|$|R
40|$|Dedicated to “Captain ” James M. Cook on the {{occasion}} of his 65 th birthday ξ Hagemann’s esters can be converted into highly functionalized <b>phenols</b> <b>or</b> arenes. The systematic functionalization of Hagemann’s ester derivatives permits the preparation of tri- and tetraalkylsubstituted <b>phenols</b> <b>or</b> tetra-, penta-, and hexaalkyl-substituted benzenes. Kotnis’s aromatization procedure was found to be solvent dependent, and Suzuki couplings were found to be sensitive to steric hindrance. Wittig olefination and ortho-Claisen reactions were reliable means to introduce alkyl substituents at C- 4 and/or C- 5 positions, respectively. The acid-promoted dehydration of tertiary alcohol 46 to produce enone 47, followed by its selective alkylation (cf. 48) is new.

Glucuronides predominate with <b>phenol</b> <b>or</b> a <b>phenol</b> precursor (benzene) in mammals because sulfate formation is a high-affinity, low-capacity system (due to sulfate depletion), whereas glucuronidation is a low-affinity, high-capacity (although still exhaustible) system.|$|R
