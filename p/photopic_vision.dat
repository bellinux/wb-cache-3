40|$|OBJECTIVE: In this article, {{we review}} {{the impact of}} vision on older people's night driving abilities. Driving is the {{preferred}} and primary mode of transport for older people. It is a complex activity where intact vision is seminal for road safety. Night driving requires mesopic rather than scotopic vision, because there is always some light available when driving at night. Scotopic refers to night <b>vision,</b> <b>photopic</b> refers to <b>vision</b> under well-lit conditions, and mesopic vision {{is a combination of}} <b>photopic</b> and scotopic <b>vision</b> in low but not quite dark lighting situations. With increasing age, mesopic vision decreases and glare sensitivity increases, {{even in the absence of}} ocular diseases. Because of the increasing number of elderly drivers, more drivers are affected by night vision difficulties. Vision tests, which accurately predict night driving ability, are therefore of great interest. METHODS: We reviewed existing literature on age-related influences on vision and vision tests that correlate or predict night driving ability. RESULTS: We identified several studies that investigated the relationship between vision tests and night driving. These studies found correlations between impaired mesopic vision or increased glare sensitivity and impaired night driving, but no correlation was found among other tests; for example, useful field of view or visual field. The correlation between photopic visual acuity, the most commonly used test when assessing elderly drivers, and night driving ability has not yet been fully clarified. CONCLUSIONS: Photopic visual acuity alone is not a good predictor of night driving ability. Mesopic visual acuity and glare sensitivity seem relevant for night driving. Due to the small number of studies evaluating predictors for night driving ability, further research is needed...|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of rod cells having a peak {{sensitivity}} at a wavelength of 530 nanometers they cannot perceive all colours on the visual spectrum. Because rod cells are insensitive to long wavelengths, the use of red lights and red lens glasses has become a common practise for accelerating dark adaptation. [...] In order for dark adaptation to be significantly accelerated an individual should ideally begin this practise 30 minutes prior to entering a low luminescence setting. [...] This practise will allow an individual to maintain their <b>photopic</b> (day) <b>vision</b> whilst preparing for scotopic vision. The insensitivity to red light will prevent the rod cells from further becoming bleached and allow for the rhodopsin photopigment to recharge back to its active conformation. [...] Once an individual enters a dark setting most of their rod cells will already be accommodated to the dark {{and be able to}} transmit visual signals to the brain without an accommodation period. The concept of red lenses for dark adaptation is based upon experimentation by Antoine Béclère and his early work with radiology. In 1916, the scientist Wilhelm Trendelenburg invented the first pair of red adaptation goggles for radiologists to adapt their eyes to view screens during fluoroscopic procedures.|$|R

The paper will begin with an overview of the eye including discussions of exactly what <b>photopic</b> and scotopic <b>vision</b> are, as well as how the eye works.

After the groundwork has been laid, the factors that affect how the eye perceives light will be discussed. These factors include pupil size and color of the light. A discussion of the basis for current lighting industry design and how light levels are measured will follow. Once these topics have been fully explored, there will be a discussion of the changes that could occur in the lighting industry if scotopic vision is taken into account. Increased energy efficiency would result if the scotopic vision is incorporated, resulting from the decrease in needed total lumen output. There have been a few applications that have utilized the effects of the scotopic vision in their design, these cases will be presented. Following the case study discussions, will be a discussion of a survey conducted by myself on the change-out of high pressure sodium (HPS) fixtures to LED fixtures in the downtown Poyntz Avenue area of Manhattan, KS.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cone visual {{pigments}} {{are responsible}} for color vision. Using low-temperature spectroscopy and linear/logarithmic time scale flash photolysis, we studied the photochemistry of the cone visual pigment P 521 from the lizard Gekko gekko. We found both meta I and meta I 1 intermediates in this cone pigment; meta I absorbs at 480 nm, and meta I 1 absorbs at ca. 380 nm. The formation of meta I is a fast process with a lifetime of 2. 8 ps for the slow component (pH 6. 70, 8. 0 O C, 2 % digitonin) compared to 2. 1 ps for bovine rhodopsin under these conditions. The formation of meta I 1 does not have single-exponential kinetics but can be better characterized by fast and slow components. High pH favors faster kinetics of meta I 1 formation, but less is formed. The amount of meta I 1 formed has a pKa of 8. 7. The fast component of the meta I 1 formation {{seems to have a}} somewhat lower pK, (e. g., 6. 4). Temperature also affects meta I 1 formation, with high temperature favoring a faster rate and larger amounts. The higher pKa of the meta I to meta I 1 transition in gecko P 521 compared to a rod pigment like bovine rhodopsin (pK, = 6. 4) probably is due to a cysteine residue at position 21 1 in gecko rather than a histidine residue in bovine rhodopsin.

40|$|The {{ion channel}} HCN 1 (hyperpolarisation-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated channel- 1) is {{expressed}} in photoreceptors of the mammalian retina. The central conclusion {{of the present study}} says that HCN 1 in rods counteracts saturation of light responses by bright light stimuli. The mammalian retina works in an intensity range that covers ten orders of magnitude. This task is achieved by two photoreceptors. The very sensitive rods are optimized for scotopic (night) vision, the less sensitive cones for <b>photopic</b> (day) <b>vision.</b> Cones relay their information via bipolar cells to the ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina. Rods feed their signals into the cone network at multiple sites. Using the patch-clamp technique, I recorded in vitro light responses of ganglion cells from retinae of normal (wild type) mice and of mice, in which the gene encoding HCN 1 had been knocked out (K. O.). Recordings were performed under different states of adaptation with contribution of only rods (scotopic), only cones (photopic), or both rods and cones (mesopic) to the light responses. Flicker stimuli of different frequencies were applied and current or voltage responses were recorded. Under scotopic and photopic conditions, no major differences were observed between light responses from wild type and from HCN 1 K. O. retinae. In both retinae, ganglion cell responses followed flicker stimuli equally well. Under mesopic conditions, light intensity was chosen such that rod responses saturated. In wild type retinae, light responses of ganglion cells were similar to those under photopic conditions. In contrast, in HCN 1 knock-out retinae light responses of ganglion cells could not even follow flicker stimuli of low frequencies. Cells responded as if they were saturated by bright and long lasting light stimuli. A second mouse line was used in which in addition the gene encoding the visual pigment of rods, rhodopsin, was knocked out. These mice have no functional rods. In those retinae, despite the absence of HCN 1 no saturation of light responses was observed. It is the task of HCN 1 in rods to counteract saturation and thus, to enable vision under mesopic conditions.

40|$|Molecular {{investigation}} {{of the origin of}} colour vision has discovered five visual pigment (opsin) genes, all of which are expressed in an agnathan (jawless) fish, the lamprey Geotria australis. Lampreys are extant representatives of an ancient group of vertebrates whose origins are thought to date back to at least the early Cambrian, approximately 540 million years ago [1. ]. Phylogenetic analysis has identified the visual pigment opsin genes of G. australis as orthologues of the major classes of vertebrate opsin genes. Therefore, multiple opsin genes must have originated very early in vertebrate evolution, prior to the separation of the jawed and jawless vertebrate lineages, and thereby provided the genetic basis for colour vision in all vertebrate species.

40|$|Most {{vertebrates}} have a duplex retina comprising two photoreceptor types, rods for dim-light (scotopic) {{vision and}} cones for bright-light (<b>photopic)</b> and color <b>vision.</b> However, deep-sea fishes are only active in dim-light conditions; hence, most species {{have lost their}} cones {{in favor of a}} simplex retina composed exclusively of rods. Although the pearlsides, Maurolicus spp., have such a pure rod retina, their behavior is at odds with this simplex visual system. Contrary to other deep-sea fishes, pearlsides are mostly active during dusk and dawn close to the surface, where light levels are intermediate (twilight or mesopic) and require the use of both rod and cone photoreceptors. This study elucidates this paradox by demonstrating that the pearlside retina does not have rod photoreceptors only; instead, it is composed almost exclusively of transmuted cone photoreceptors. These transmuted cells combine the morphological characteristics of a rod photoreceptor with a cone opsin and a cone phototransduction cascade to form a unique photoreceptor type, a rod-like cone, specifically tuned to the light conditions of the pearlsides 2 ̆ 7 habitat (blue-shifted light at mesopic intensities). Combining properties of both rods and cones into a single cell type, instead of using two photoreceptor types that do not function at their full potential under mesopic conditions, {{is likely to be the}} most efficient and economical solution to optimize visual performance.

Previous studies have used either anesthetized or paralyzed fishes to determine temporal resolution, measured as the maximum critical flicker fusion frequency (CFFmax). However, sedation with the anesthetic, tricaine methanesulfonate (MS- 222), is thought to suppress sensory system responses, although empirical evidence is lacking. Therefore, we quantified scotopic and photopic CFFmax in the yellow stingray, Urobatis jamaicensis, at the extremes of its temperature range, 20 °C and 30 °C, and immobilized with anesthesia, MS- 222, or a paralytic, Pavulon. Both low temperature and anesthesia (MS- 222) reduced CFFmax. With an increase of 10 °C, CFFmax doubled from 12 Hz to 25. 3 Hz (photopic) under Pavulon, whereas CFFmax increased by only 4 Hz, from 6. 7 Hz to 10. 7 Hz (photopic) under MS- 222 anesthesia. In general, MS- 222 anesthesia minimized the effects of both temperature and light-adaptation compared to Pavulon.

Only one of seven subjects demonstrated this effect, which we traced to wavelength-specific absorption. Observers with advanced photoreceptor disorders tended to read blue text faster than red text. This could not be explained on the basis of photopic spectral sensitivities alone. Finally, the presence of central or peripheral field loss was not predictive of wavelength-specific effects in reading. On the whole, wavelength only occasionally plays a significant role in reading.
