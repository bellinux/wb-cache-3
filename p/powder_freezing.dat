In the present investigation jambhul was preserved by using infrared drying technology and jambhul powder was utilized to develop Kulfi which is popular Indian frozen dessert. The infrared jambhul powder showed TPC (27. 61 mg/g), TF (28. 75 mg/g), Anthocyanins (2. 59 mg/g), ABTS (27. 19 µM/g), and DPPH (375. 32 µM/g).

40|$|Kiwifruit {{consumption}} {{is well known}} {{to have a positive}} impact on digestive health. Actinidin and kiwellin, two kiwifruit proteins have been characterised because of their importance in Actazin™ that is produced from kiwifruit to aid digestion. A biophysical characterisation was carried out for both proteins and the catalytic activity of actinidin was measured during the production of Actazin™ to assess if kiwifruit processing was detrimental to the catalytic rate. Actinidin, purified from A. deliciosa cultivar showed that a decrease in enzymatic activity could be from partially inactivated actinidin. Similarly actinidin from Actazin™ became inactivated when the powder was solubilised in buffer. Most of the lost activity could be recovered when a reductant was added and it is hypothesised that the catalytically important cysteine residue was becoming oxidised by a chemical species that was present in the solubilised kiwifruit <b>powder.</b> <b>Freezing,</b> thawing, and storing the processed kiwifruit pulp resulted in the largest drop of total actinidin activity of 46 %. Freeze drying the frozen pulp surprisingly did not significantly affect the retention of actinidin despite incurring prolonged heat stress. Further studies that assess the effects that freezing and thawing have on the stability of actinidin is therefore suggested. Kiwellin was characterised using a number of analytical techniques and was shown to be a monomeric protein in solution that had a high melting point. It was suggested that disulfide bonds and salt bridges could be stabilising kiwellin, which was also highly dynamic in solution. Kiwellin did not show the presence of any secondary structures, which is in contrast to previous studies and small angle X-ray scattering revealed that kiwellin had an elongated shape. The dynamic nature of the protein may have implications for the interactions between kiwellin and actinidin, which has been previously shown and this could be related to the physiological function of kiwellin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Graphene oxide powders {{prepared}} by two different drying processes, freeze drying and spray drying, were studied {{to compare the}} effect of the drying method on the physical properties of graphene oxide powder. The graphene oxide dispersion was prepared from graphite by chemical delamination with the aid of sulfuric acid and permanganic acid, and the dispersion was further washed and re-dispersed in a mixed solvent of water and isopropyl alcohol. A freeze drying method can feasibly minimize damage to the sample, but it requires a long process time. In contrast, spray drying is able to remove a solvent in a relatively short time, though this process requires exposure to a high temperature for a rapid evaporation of the solvent. The <b>powders</b> {{prepared by}} <b>freeze</b> drying and spray drying were characterized and compared by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and by an elemental analysis. The graphene oxide powders showed similar chemical compositions; however, the morphologies of the powders differed in that the graphene oxide prepared by spray drying had a winkled morphology and a higher apparent density compared to the <b>powder</b> prepared by <b>freeze</b> drying.

40|$|In this research, three {{different}} sol-gel synthesis methods by using cost effective materials, such as sugar + pectin, sodium alginate beads or sodium alginate granules, {{have been investigated}} for nanopowders production in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) application. Materials (cerium gadolinium oxide and nickel oxide) have been selected as model materials. Cerium gadolinium oxide (CGO) {{is one of the}} most important electrolyte materials in SOFC due to its high ionic conductivity at 500 - 800 "C, whilst nickel oxide (NiO) can be reduced into nickel in SOFC fuels (H 2 or CH 4) as catalyst in anode layer. First of all, a novel sol-gel method has been developed for the production of high purity nanopowders of Ce 0. 8 Gd 0. 201. 9 (CG 02) solid solution using maltose or sucrose as an organic chelating agent and pectin for gelation. The results of this investigation indicate that the final particle size of approximately 10 nm can be obtained after calcination of the dried gel at, 500 °C for 2 hours in ambient air. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows that all samples are single phase cubic CGO powders. The mean crystallite sizes calculated from XRD analysis using Rietveld refinement method agree with the morphological features observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The nominal composition of CG 02 has been found to be in excellent agreement with that determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and inductively coupled plasma - atomic emission spectrometry analysis (ICP-AES). The ionic conductivities of Ceo. 8 Gdo. 201. 9 samples are measured by AC-impedance which appears reasonably well with the reference data which will qualify the use of this material for SOFC as solid electrolyte and in the fabrication of composite electrodes. On the other hand, another novel and generic sol-gel method has been developed for the production of high purity metal oxide nanopowders using sodium alginate (Na-ALG). This has been demonstrated successfully employing NiO and CGO CG 01 (Ce 0. 9 Gd 0. 1 O 1. 95) and CGO 2 (Ce 0. 8 Gd 0. 201. 9) as model materials in this instance. For NiO, the results of this investigation indicate that the final particle size of - 20 nm can be obtained after calcination of the predried beads at 500 °C for 3 hours in ambient air. XRD shows that the obtained samples are single phase cubic NiO <b>powders.</b> Furthermore, <b>freeze</b> dried and X-ray micro-tomography (XMT) technologies are applied to observe the inside morphology of the Ni-ALG beads. XMT shows that nickel ions have been uniformly cross-linked in the alginate structure and remained stable after freeze drying evidenced by the bright green color of the freeze dried beads. Finally, NiO nanopowders can also be synthesized using Na-ALG granules. Moreover, this alginate method has also been demonstrated successfully employing CGO in two composites designated as CG 01 (Ceo. 9 Gdo. 101. 95) and CG 02 (Ceo. aGdo. 201. 9), respectively. The results indicate that the nanopowders having a final particle size of - 7 nm can be obtained after calcination of ion-exchanged alginate precursor at 500 degC for 2 hours in ambient' air. The chemical structures of Na-ALG solution and CGO beads are analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) which indicates that Ce 3 +/Gd 3 + are ion-exchanged with Na+ after gelation. The nominal compositions of CG 01 and CG 02 have been found to be in excellent agreement with that determined by EDS and ICP-AES. The ionic conductivities of these two samples are measured by AC-impedance which appears reasonably well with the reference data which will also qualify the use of this material for SOFC as solid electrolyte. All of these new sol-gel methods are simple, environmentally friendly and non-toxic routes for a large scale production of high purity single phase nanopowders in a cost effective manner at significantly low temperatures.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Background: Green tea is a {{rich source}} of the strong {{antioxidant}} compounds, the catechins, and the unique amino acid, theanine, which have been linked with health benefits such as prevention of certain types of cancers and cardiovascular diseases, decrease in obesity and improvement of the immune system. However, epidemiological studies suggest that the volume of green tea required to obtain health benefits is rather large, ranging from 5 - 10 cups a day. Therefore, it is questionable whether individuals, especially in western countries where they are not used to drinking green tea, can consume a large enough quantity of green tea to obtain the levels of the green tea bioactive compounds needed for health benefits. Therefore, extraction of the catechins and theanine from green tea to provide concentrated preparations for use as food supplements or as additives for functional foods has been considered as a way to increase the consumption of these green tea bioactive compounds. In addition, green tea extracts and powders can be utilised in various foods to prolong their shelf-life. Green tea also contains a high level of caffeine, which can work as a mild central nervous stimulant. However, caffeine can cause some negative effects in some people and therefore, its removal from green tea products needs to be addressed. Furthermore, {{as a consequence of the}} concerns relative to the use of organic solvents, which are usually used for extractions of plant materials in the food industry, water is the only solvent which should be used. Another way of increasing the intake of the beneficial green tea components is to ensure that they are well extracted when people prepare their green tea themselves. A low extraction of the compounds could be one of the reasons why large amounts of the beverage appear to be needed to obtain the health benefits. Hypothesis and Aims: The current study hypothesised that the aqueous extraction of the three bioactive components, the catechins, theanine and caffeine, from loose leaf green tea or green tea in tea bags, could be improved and that aqueous extractions could be used to prepare decaffeinated, normal caffeine and caffeine-enriched green tea catechin powders. The overall aims were to 1) improve the aqueous extraction of the three main bioactive components, catechins, theanine and caffeine from loose leaf green tea, 2) to prepare decaffeinated, normal caffeine and caffeine-enriched green tea catechin powders from freshly harvested young and old green tea leaves using water as the only solvent for the extractions and freeze drying and spray drying to dry the aqueous extracts, and 3) to improve the extraction of the three green tea bioactive components form green tea in teabags using water and the microwave oven. Results: The results showed that the extraction of the catechins from loose leaf green tea could be improved by brewing ground green tea (≤ 1 mm) twice: once at 80 °C for 30 min with a water-to-tea ratio of 12 : 1 mL/g and once at 80 °C for 30 min with a water-to-tea ratio of 8 : 1 mL/g. The extraction of the theanine from loose leaf green tea could be also improved by brewing ground green tea (0. 5 - 1 mm) at 80 °C for 30 min with a water-to-tea ratio of 20 : 1 mL/g. Water was also found to be effective for decaffeinating freshly harvested young (apical bud to fourth leaf on the growing shoot) and old tea leaves (the fifth to tenth leaves down the stem). Blanching the young tea leaves at 100 °C for 4 min at a water-to-tea ratio of 20 : 1 mL/g removed 83 % of the caffeine while retaining 94 % of the catechins whereas blanching the old tea leaves at 100 °C for 10 min at a water-to-tea ratio of 20 : 1 mL/g removed 80 % of the caffeine while retaining 83 % of the catechins. Three types of green tea powders: decaffeinated, normal caffeine and caffeine-enriched green tea powders were also prepared by brewing, filtering, concentrating extracts and then either freeze drying or spray drying them into <b>powders.</b> Both <b>freeze</b> drying and spray drying were found to be suitable for drying the green tea aqueous extracts. However, in terms of cost-effectiveness, spray drying was considered as a method of choice and its optimal conditions were found to be 180 °C for the inlet temperature and 115 °C for the outlet temperature. These green tea powders had catechin levels of 174 - 197 mg/g and theanine levels of 7 - 22 mg/g. The caffeine levels were 6. 1 - 7. 3 mg/g for decaffeinated powder, 21. 3 - 21. 8 mg/g for normal caffein powder and 94. 8 mg/g for caffeine-enriched powder. In addition, these green tea powders had excellent physical properties such as high water solubility (≥ 96 %) and low moisture content (< 2. 5 %). Finally, the results indicated that brewing teabags for 3 min at room temperature in 200 mL of boiled water, as suggested by the manufacturers, was not efficient as only 62 % of the catechins, 76 % of the caffeine and 80 % of the theanine were extracted from the teabags. However, the extraction of these three bioactive components could be improved by first brewing the teabags in freshly boiled water for 0. 5 min at room temperature followed by irradiation for 1 min in a microwave oven. This method improved the extraction of the catechins, caffeine and theanine by 34 %, 29 % and 14 %, respectively, in comparison with the common brewing method of 3 min in 200 mL of boiled water. Conclusions: In conclusion, the hypothesis was supported and the aims were achieved. The aqueous extraction of the three main bioactive components, the catechins, theanine and caffeine from green tea was optimised and improved. In addition, using water as the only solvent, this study developed methods to prepare decaffeinated dried green tea and decaffeinated, normal caffeine and caffeine-enriched green tea catechin powders from freshly harvested young and old green tea leaves. Finally, this study developed a method using the microwave oven to improve the extraction of the three green tea bioactive components from green tea in teabags...|$|R
