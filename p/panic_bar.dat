50|$|Carl Prinzler, {{co-inventor}} of the Von Duprin <b>panic</b> <b>bar</b> device, was {{manager of}} the builder's hardware department in 1903.|$|E
50|$|The <b>panic</b> <b>bar</b> was marketed {{under the}} Von Duprin name. Von Duprin {{is a company}} which makes {{security}} related products.|$|E
50|$|The Iroquois fire {{prompted}} widespread {{implementation of}} the <b>panic</b> <b>bar,</b> first invented in the United Kingdom following the Victoria Hall disaster. Panic exit devices are now required by building codes for high-occupancy spaces, and were mass manufactured in the US following the fire by the Von Duprin company (now part of Allegion).|$|E
50|$|In some applications, such as {{storefront}} entrances, <b>panic</b> <b>bars</b> may be dogged during business hours. Dogging is {{a common}} feature on <b>panic</b> <b>bars</b> in which the bar is retracted with a key—freeing the door to swing without latching. This allows customers to apply force to any portion of the door, not just the bar, in order to open it.|$|R
50|$|In the European Union, <b>panic</b> <b>bars</b> {{are governed}} by the {{standard}} EN 1125, Panic exit devices operated by a horizontal bar. As with other EN family standards, the English language version is produced by the British Standards Institution and utilizes the call sign BS EN 1125. <b>Panic</b> <b>bars</b> are required to conform to this standard in order to carry CE marking and thus be sold in the European Economic Area.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, {{the use of}} <b>panic</b> <b>bars</b> are {{generally}} confined to code required applications. On the other hand, in US and Canadian commercial building design <b>panic</b> <b>bars</b> are frequently used even when not required by code. This is because bars {{are seen as a}} simpler opening mechanism for users than a knob or lever handle. And while the public generally prefers automatic door opening solutions to both these options, automatic doors can be costly to install and maintain.|$|R
50|$|Crash bar (also {{known as}} a panic exit device, <b>panic</b> <b>bar,</b> or push bar) {{is a type of}} door opening {{mechanism}} which allows users to open a door by pushing a bar. While originally conceived as a way to prevent stampedes in an emergency, crash bars are now used as the primary door opening mechanism in many commercial buildings.|$|E
50|$|Many patrons {{attempted}} to exit {{through the main}} entrance, {{the same way they}} had entered. The building's main entrance was a single revolving door, which was rendered useless as the crowd stampeded in panic. Bodies piled up behind both sides of the revolving door, jamming it until it broke. But then the oxygen-hungry fire leaped through the breach, incinerating whoever was left alive in the pile. Firemen had to douse the flames to approach the door. Later, after fire laws had tightened, it would become illegal to have only one revolving door as a main entrance without being flanked by outward opening doors with <b>panic</b> <b>bar</b> openers attached, or have the revolving doors set up so that the doors could fold against themselves in emergency situations.|$|E
40|$|The {{door guard}} {{of the present}} {{invention}} utilizes an L-shaped bar which binds against the <b>panic</b> <b>bar</b> {{of the door and}} against the door frame to prevent the <b>panic</b> <b>bar</b> from being pulled down and thus opening the door. The L-shaped bar has a front and side leg. The front leg has attached to it an upper and lower tab which fits one {{on either side of the}} <b>panic</b> <b>bar.</b> The side leg binds against the door frame...|$|E
50|$|<b>Panic</b> <b>bars</b> on {{emergency}} exit doors, which sound an alarm {{when the door}} is opened, are in all stations of the New York City Subway.|$|R
25|$|<b>Panic</b> <b>bars</b> {{are often}} used in {{buildings}} so that a door locked from the exterior can quickly and easily be opened from the inside {{in the event of}} a fire or other emergency.|$|R
50|$|<b>Panic</b> <b>bars</b> {{were also}} installedon Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) in Boston and on Chicago TransitAuthority (CTA). This {{provided}} an impetus for renewed interests in evasion, becauseevaders could enter through gates when already opened by exiting passengers.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, it {{is notable}} that most <b>panic</b> <b>bars</b> {{are of the}} cross bar type, which are called Type A in the EN 1125 standard. This {{contrasts}} strongly with North American architectural design, which years ago switched to using predominantly touch bars (EN 1125 Type B) in new construction.|$|R
50|$|However, EN 179 devices shall {{only be used}} at {{locations}} where people “are familiar with the emergency exit and its hardware and therefore a panic situation is unlikely to appear.” Examples of places where EN 179 hardware {{may be used in}} place of EN 1125 <b>panic</b> <b>bars</b> include small apartment buildings and offices.|$|R
50|$|Mating {{fasteners}} {{are known}} by many different names: sex bolt, binding posts, Chicago screws, interscrews, barrel bolts, barrel nut, partition screws, door closure bolts, furniture screws, panel fasteners, architectural sex bolts, arch series screws, hinge screws, display fasteners, screw nuts, connector bolts, threaded rivets, grommet nuts, post and screw sets, book screws, and stationary screws. Applications vary widely from book binding to installing bathroom partitions. This group of fasteners {{are used to}} assemble fitness apparatus, solar panels, playground equipment, railing systems, furniture, athletic helmets, knives, store fixtures, signs, <b>panic</b> <b>bars,</b> and many other products.|$|R

"Now, {{dreams are}} {{wonderful}} things, as everybody knows--so wonderful, indeed, {{that some people}} stop not short of ascribing them directly to heaven; and China Aster, who was of a proper turn of mind in everything, thought that in consideration of the dream, it would be but well to wait a little, ere seeking Orchis again. During the day, China Aster's mind dwelling continually upon the dream, he {{was so full of}} it, that when Old Plain Talk dropped in to see him, just before dinnertime, as he often did, out of the interest he took in Old Honesty's son, China Aster told all about his vision, adding that he could not think that so radiant an angel could deceive; and, indeed, talked at such a rate that one would have thought he believed the angel some beautiful human philanthropist. Something in this sort Old Plain Talk understood him, and, accordingly, in his plain way, said: 'China Aster, you tell me that an angel appeared to you in a dream. Now, what does that amount to but this, that you dreamed an angel appeared to you? Go right away, China Aster, and return the check, as I advised you before. If friend Prudence were here, he would say just the same thing.' With which words Old Plain Talk went off to find friend Prudence, but not succeeding, was returning to the candlery himself, when, at distance mistaking him for a dun who had long annoyed him, China Aster in a <b>panic</b> <b>barred</b> all his doors, and ran to the back part of the candlery, where no knock could be heard.|$|R

They try to force Rachel to kiss them all; she runs out and they wreck the room. Chris bursts in outraged and the members assault him, knocking him out. Horrified, they <b>panic</b> and <b>bar</b> the door, despite the landlord being seriously hurt. Hugo calls an ambulance, much to everyone else's discontent. Eventually they all agree to pin the blame on Alistair, who has consistently riled them throughout the night.

40|$|While Labor is {{apparently}} considering large-scale tax reform, John Quiggin says {{the public has}} other priorities on its mind FOR THE first time in years, the federal election looks set to be fought on the bread-and-butter question that dominates modern politics, the balance between taxing and spending. The 1993 and 1998 elections were dominated by the distraction of the GST, the 1996 election was a referendum on Paul Keating and the 2001 election was dominated by terrorism and <b>panic</b> about refugees. <b>Barring</b> a big foreign-policy shock, the question dominating the 2004 election will be whether any budget surplus accruing to {{the government should be}} returned in the form of tax cuts or as higher spending on services such as health and education (there’s a third option keeping the surplus and paying off debt but neither party seems likely to propose this). A Newspoll reported by the Australian this week suggests that, as far as the public is concerned, this issue has already been decided. When asked to choose between allocating a large surplus between tax cuts and spending on health and education, 72 per cent of respondents preferred allocating it mainly to health and education, 16 per cent favoured an equal division and only 9 per cent preferred allocating it mainly to personal tax cuts. It’s hard to recall such an overwhelming expression of preference on an issue of political controversy. The most recent example was in relation to Pauline Hanson’s three-year prison sentence. Presented with such a scoop, the Australian could have made a big splash. In fact, the news was not only played down, but was accompanied by an editorial headed, amazingly, ‘Cutting income tax is a political winner’. The basis for this claim was a second Newspoll question, about the top marginal rate of taxation. Of the respondents, 27 per cent said it was much too high, 23 per cent a little too high, 34 per cent about right and 8 per cent too low. The Australian’s report of the Newspoll ran with this finding, under the headline, ‘Top rate too high, say half of voters’. There is no contradiction between these two results. As any economics student knows, meeting a budget is a matter of trade-offs. Someone who thinks the top marginal rate is ‘a little too high’, but that health and education services are severely under-funded, is likely to prefer allocating scarce public funds to the more urgent problems first. The poll results suggest, reasonably enough, that only those who think that the top marginal rate is ‘much too high’ favour allocating part or all of any surplus to reducing it. But how did the Australian manage to dismiss the overwhelming majority of voters who preferred better health and education to tax cuts? Quoting pollster Sol Lebovic, it suggested that voters were giving the ‘socially acceptable’ answer. According to the editorialist, the ‘gut instincts’ of voters were for tax cuts, and politicians would disregard this at their peril. How the contents of our guts were determined is a question that is perhaps best left alone. The point attributed to Lebovic is an interesting one. It’s well known that (naively designed) readership surveys will show many more households taking the National Geographic than the the National Enquirer, even though audited circulation figures show the opposite. Still, it’s unusual for a pollster to trash his own product by suggesting it is flawed in this way. More importantly, if expressing a preference for tax cuts over health and education spending is as socially unacceptable as a taste for supermarket scandal sheets, {{it would seem that the}} public debate is already over. In reality, there’s little support for such a condescending view. If the question is changed to make ‘social services’ rather than ‘health and education’ the alternative, a plurality of voters prefer tax cuts. The term is ambiguous but most commonly refers to social-welfare benefits and services directed at the poor, unemployed and single mothers. In preferring health and education to social services or tax cuts, voters are not giving ‘altruistic’ answers that might make them look good. Rather they want a government that does something for them and their children, and they are willing to give up tax cuts if they can get it. There is a standard political response to unfavourable poll results election day is the only poll that counts. A string of state election results in the past five years have confirmed that, when voters say they want better health and education, they mean it. In an election fought on domestic policy issues, the party that gives them what they want will win.
