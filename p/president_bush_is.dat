5|$|We {{are pleased}} the President recognizes the near {{pristine}} {{condition of the}} Northwestern Hawaiian Islands waters. We believe the abundance and biodiversity of the area attests to the successful management of the NWHI fisheries by the Council the past 30 years and indicates that properly regulated fisheries can operate in the NWHI without impacting the ecosystem. The small NWHI bottomfish fishery has not and would not jeopardize {{the protection of the}} NWHI that <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> pursuing by designating the area a national monument.|$|E
25|$|I believe <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> running {{deficits in}} Washington very deliberately. His {{plan is to}} finally run up so much debt that it inevitably creates {{pressure}} on the funding of things that count, {{in terms of the}} long-term strength of the society: educating kids, retirement security for American families. A mini version of that is going on in Sacramento.|$|E
25|$|Some say {{economic}} regulation expanded rapidly during the Bush administration. <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> described by these observers {{as the biggest}} regulator since President Richard Nixon.

25|$|The United Nations Special Rapporteur on {{torture and}} other cruel, inhuman or {{degrading}} treatment or punishment– Manfred Nowak– on 20 January 2009, remarked on German television that, following {{the inauguration of}} Barack Obama as new President, George W.

25|$|As I {{testified to}} the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the {{indigenous}} capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks. And my concern is if we continue to push for military action against Iraq, and once the writing becomes clear on the wall -- and believe me, if Saddam Hussein doesn't understand that <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> dead serious about going to war against him now, I don't know when he'll be -- when he'll recognize that. But at some point, I believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. And I think the Iraqi government's efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this is the direction that Saddam Hussein is heading.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before the}} end of President Bush's second term, newsmedia in other {{countries}} started opining that under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, the United States is obligated to hold those responsible for prisoner abuse to account under criminal law. One proponent of this view was the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Professor Manfred Nowak) who, on January 20, 2009, remarked on German television that former president George W. Bush had lost his head of state immunity and under international law, the United States would now be mandated to start criminal proceedings against all those involved in these violations of the UN Convention Against Torture.

President Bush said he would not accept every recommendation by the ISG panel but promised that he would take the report seriously. <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> expected to wait for three other studies from the Pentagon, the US State Department and the National Security Council before charting the new course on Iraq.|$|E
2500|$|John Hawkins, {{a fellow}} writer for Human Events, responded: [...] "Yesterday, Jerome Corsi was prattling {{on about the}} North American Union again after Michael Medved deservedly spanked him for {{spreading}} conspiracy theories. While I don't think Corsi is any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think Jews rule the world or the 'Truthers' who think <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> responsible for 9/11, I thought I would respond to him one last time." [...] John Hawkins listed Corsi as number three on his list of [...] "The Most Annoying People on the Right", and wrote: [...] "Nobody has worked harder {{to convince people that}} the completely moronic North American conspiracy theory is real than the right's version of Dylan Avery, kooky Jerome Corsi."
