40|$|Detasseling {{is used in}} {{hybrid corn}} (Zea mays L.) seed {{production}} to ensure harvested seeds have the desired genetic complement. Both mechanical and hand detasseling result in loss of some leaf tissue and plant N. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if seed yield and quality and N content of grain and stover were affected by leaf removal during detasseling. The treatments evaluated were removal of tassel only, tassel plus one leaf, tassel plus two leaves, tassel plus three leaves, tassel plus four leaves, and no tissue <b>removed</b> (control). The <b>leaf</b> area index (LAI) declined linearly, about 0. 16 LAI units per <b>leaf</b> <b>removed.</b> Grain and stover yield also declined linearly with number of leaves removed with the tassel (r 2 = 0. 97 and 0. 92, respectively). Each <b>leaf</b> <b>removed</b> reduced grain yield about 0. 36 Mg ha- 1. Yield reduction was caused by decreased kernel size. Grain and stover N concentration and amount of N in stover did not vary among detasseled treatments. However, total N in the grain declined linearly as number of leaves removed increased (r 2 = 0. 97). Warm and cold germination and warm germination after accelerated aging were not affected by leaf removal during detasseling. Results reported here suggest that when leaves are removed from the plant at detasseling, the loss of photosynthetic capacity, the ability to intercept light, and plant N all contribute to grain yield reduction...|$|R

Journal of Chemical Ecology, 35, (4), 469 - 475. IMPF: 02. 41 RONO: 00 Sponsorship: Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana?ChampaignA field {{study on the}} effects of current grazing practices on plants in central Norway found no increase in either phenolic compounds or proteinase inhibitors in plants subjected to grazing by sheep. This could either reflect insufficient damage to the plants due to low grazing intensity or a lack of a long-term response of the plants to grazing. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that damage to forage plants used by sheep and rodents in Norwegian alpine rangelands can stimulate a long-term (at least 2 -week) increase in levels of defensive compounds. We used clipping experiments to manipulate the severity and timing of damage to eight species of common plants used by herbivores in Norway. Under greenhouse conditions (i. e., climate-controlled), we subjected mature plants to one of four clipping treatments: control (0 % <b>leaf</b> tissue <b>removed),</b> low (10 ? 15 % <b>leaf</b> tissue <b>removed),</b> high (70 ? 75 % <b>leaf</b> tissue <b>removed),</b> or sustained (15 % of <b>leaf</b> tissue <b>removed</b> every other day up to a total removal of 75 %, i. e., five clippings over 9 days). Samples were collected 2 weeks after final clipping and analyzed for concentrations of total phenolics, proteinase inhibitors, ratio of total phenolics to soluble proteins, and ratio of proteinase inhibitors to soluble plant proteins. As expected, the different species of plants responded differently to simulated herbivory, but most plants either showed no response to mechanical wounding and tissue loss or had reduced defensive compounds. Thus, our results do not support the hypothesis that herbivory induces a long-term increase in defensive compounds in alpine rangelands of Norway, a result consistent with those from field studies.

This signal induces flowering despite low FT expression the rest of the day. To investigate whether this temporal behaviour transmits information, plants of Arabidopsis thaliana were exposed to different day-night cycles, including combinations that induced FT expression out of normal hours. Flowering time best correlated with the integral of FT expression over several days, corrected for a higher evening and early night sensitivity to FT. We generated a system to induce FT expression in a <b>leaf</b> <b>removed</b> 8 - 12  h later.

Generally leaf is used for medicinal purpose but root, flower and fruit also have the medicinal values (Hasan 1982). Leaf of the plant contains essential oil, an alkaloid, nishindin.

40|$|With the {{objective}} of further reducing energy consumption in gerbera cultivation and financed by the program “Greenhouse as Source of Energy” and the Knowledge Cooperation Gerbera, research was conducted from July 2016 to July 2017 at WUR Greenhouse Horticulture in Bleiswijk. In the test, the insulation of the greenhouse was increased by separating the existing 2 -layers of the light tight screen, creating an air layer of 5 cm in between them. This improved the temperature layering between the greenhouse and the greenhouse cover, resulting in very low net radiation losses by the crop. The applied light-dependent temperature strategy proved technically and physiologically suitable between November and May. The day length in winter was gradually extended to 13 or 15 hours, with a proportional increase of the average day temperature (at least 16 °C) according to the light dependent temperature strategy. This saved some energy on heat, but required more electricity without improving production or quality; on the contrary, the crop showed an increased vegetative growth. All the leaves that intercept light seem to contribute actively to the photosynthesis. As a result, leaf pruning in winter, regardless {{of the age of}} the <b>leaf</b> <b>removed,</b> led to a reduced flower production...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{effect of}} {{herbivory}} on plant fitness varies widely. Understanding {{the causes of}} this variation is of considerable interest because of its implications for plant population dynamics and trait evolution. We experimentally defoliated the annual herb Arabidopsis thaliana in a natural population in Sweden to test the hypotheses that (a) plant fitness decreases with increasing damage, (b) tolerance to defoliation is lower before flowering than during flowering, and (c) defoliation before flowering reduces number of seeds more strongly than defoliation during flowering, but {{the opposite is true}} for effects on seed size. Methodology/Principal Findings: In a first experiment, between 0 and 75 % of the <b>leaf</b> area was <b>removed</b> in May from plants that flowered or were about to start flowering. In a second experiment, 0, 25 %, or 50 % of the <b>leaf</b> area was <b>removed</b> from plants on one of two occasions, in mid April when plants were either in the vegetative rosette or bolting stage, or in mid May when plants were flowering. In the first experiment, seed production was negatively related to <b>leaf</b> area <b>removed,</b> and at the highest damage level, also mean seed size was reduced. In the second experiment, removal of 50 % of the leaf area reduced seed production by 60 % among plants defoliated early in the season at the vegetative rosettes, and by 22 % among plants defoliated early in the season at the bolting stage, but did not reduce seed output of plants defoliated one month later. No seasonal shift in the effect of defoliation on seed size was detected. Conclusions/Significance: The results show that leaf damage may reduce the fitness of A. thaliana, and suggest that in this population leaf herbivores feeding on plants before flowering should exert stronger selection on defence traits than those feeding on plants during flowering, given similar damage levels...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the forage accumulation during the stocking period on Kikuyu grass pastures (Pennisetum clandestinum Hochst. Ex. Chiov) subjected to intermittent stocking. Treatments consisted of four defoliation levels (removal of 40, 50, 60, and 70 % relative to the initial height) starting from the same pre-grazing height (20 cm). The following variables were evaluated: leaf and stem elongation rates (evaluated during four times across the period of occupation), leaf area index, and forage accumulation rates. Additionally, ten tillers/strip were evaluated for the same variables into exclusion cages. The linear, quadratic and cubic effects of severity of defoliation were evaluated by orthogonal polynomials contrasts with 5 % of significance level. There was a linear and inverse relationship between the proportion of <b>removed</b> <b>leaf</b> area index with leaf elongation and herbage accumulation rate. The leaf elongation rate in individual tillers and the forage accumulation rates of tillers on excluded areas from grazing were greater than those under grazing.

Individual bean seedlings were treated with a foliar application of 10 μM GA 3 on day 7 and day 14 after emergence, {{which led to a}} significant increase in height in GA 3 -treated plants. Twenty-eight days after emergence, either zero, one, two, or three leaflets from each trifoliate <b>leaf</b> were <b>removed</b> from each of 20 GA 3 -treated and 20 control plants. All pods were harvested from each plant after plants became senescent 6 weeks later.
