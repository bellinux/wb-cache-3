60|$|He {{wondered}} why she said nothing. Did she understand? He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm.|$|E
60|$|Agatha {{took the}} envelope, {{but as she}} began to open it the rig stopped at the gate, and George <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... 'This,' <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> a backing-bell rope, 'is {{to sound}} the fire-alarm; this,' <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> a go-ahead bell, 'is to call the texas-tender; this one,' {{indicating}} the whistle-lever, 'is to call the captain'--and so he went on, touching one object after another, and reeling off his tranquil spool of lies.|$|R
60|$|Allerton's {{face lit}} up with amusement. He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Dick's shoulders.|$|R

6000|$|But the King <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm, {{and there}} was a really brave {{awakening}} in his voice and a manly fire in his eye when he said: ...|$|E
60|$|There was a silence. The stars {{shuddered and}} broke upon the water. There came {{a breath of}} wind. He went {{suddenly}} to her, and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Elsie stooped {{and kissed}} his cheek and he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> hers.|$|R

60|$|Tito <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> {{neck and}} smiled. This little {{dialogue}} about the armour had broken {{through the new}} crust, and made a channel for the sweet habit of kindness.|$|E
6000|$|Ebbo {{checked his}} hasty march to <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> chair and kiss her brow. [...] "Motherling, I will {{restrain}} myself, {{so you will}} give me your word not to desert us." ...|$|E
60|$|Philip did {{not know}} why the remark seemed to swell his heart. He could not keep the {{distance}} from her which he had forced upon himself. He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Andrew <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Dick's {{shoulders}} {{and held him}} off at arm's length.|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{responded to}} this dialectical inquiry affirmatively by <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> revolver.|$|R
60|$|Whitney {{waited until}} he came up, and then <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no use, Mary," [...] he said. He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder. [...] "We've tried everything. It's a wretched business, I know, {{but what}} else can we do? You've failed. Doctor Bodineau's all that's left." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lister <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm {{and forced}} her to look up. [...] "Now you're clean ridiculous! Shillito cheated you; he's a {{plausible}} wastrel, but you found him out. It doesn't count at all! Besides, nobody but your relations know." ...|$|E
6000|$|He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder. [...] "I {{would not}} do that, little girl," [...] he said gently. [...] "If you cannot go with me, I shall not go. If either of us must go alone, it will be you." ...|$|E
60|$|Wilson {{would have}} replied angrily, but Captain Doolan <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shoulder.|$|R

60|$|He {{laughed and}} <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> my {{shoulder}} as he bade me good night.|$|R
60|$|Agatha did not deign to {{make any}} further reply, but as Santerre and the men had now left the steps and gone into the house, Denot <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm to lead her away from her father's side.|$|E
60|$|But {{he saw her}} on the bed, lying {{very still}} and {{scarcely}} noticeable, {{with her back to}} him. He went and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder, very gently, hesitating, in a great fear and self-offering. She did not move.|$|E
60|$|He was, indeed, {{thoroughly}} perplexed and uncomfortable: unhappy {{might not}} be too strong a word. He got up awkwardly and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm. She did not respond. He drew her, limp and unresisting, down on the lounge beside him.|$|E
60|$|The doctor came behind her, and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> {{the back}} of her chair.|$|R
60|$|At {{these words}} young Jolyon {{got up and}} <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> father's shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Mavering <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> friend's broad shoulder, {{and gave}} him a playful push.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I shall stay now," [...] he said, {{and as he}} said it he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> hand, {{which was}} on his arm. She drew it away at once. [...] "I love you so dearly," [...] he whispered to her; [...] "so dearly." ...|$|E

[...] He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> {{and she started}} {{as if she had}} been struck. But his hands, with the soft, {{powerful}} clasp, only closed her faster.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "it {{is always}} better {{if there is}} money." [...] He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> and she winced. [...] "But I marry you for love, you know. You know what love is--" [...] And {{he put his arms}} round her, and laughed down into her face.|$|E
60|$|And {{with quite}} {{unconscious}} dignity he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> breast, {{and looked at}} her.|$|R
60|$|Young Jolyon <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> father's shoulder, and, as neither spoke, {{the episode}} closed.|$|R
