The sub-carina and sub-rostrum are larger than the largest of the latera; their inner surfaces are transversely elongated, rounded at both ends, and slightly concave; externally they are pointed, and project outwards; sometimes the sub-carina, and sometimes the sub-rostrum is the largest.|$|E
60|$|Capitulum rather thick, {{with the}} five main valves having their free apices, {{diverging}} and truncated. The upper and old layers of shell do not here scale off so readily as {{in many of the}} foregoing species; and hence an unusually large proportional length of each valve <b>projects</b> <b>freely</b> above the sack; and the valves are of unusual thickness. The capitulum is very nearly as wide at its summit as at its base, owing to the divergence of the apices of the valves. The scuta and terga are articulated together by a conspicuous fold, which, when seen from vertically above, (Pl. IX, fig. 1 a´,) appears like a deep wedge-formed notch in the terga. On the exterior surfaces of the valves, the teeth on the successive rims are approximate; on the inner surfaces, the rims are covered by strong yellow membrane, which is generally fringed with small horny spines.|$|E

50|$|Dinoflagellates are {{unicellular}} and possess two dissimilar flagella {{arising from}} the ventral cell side (dinokont flagellation). They have a ribbon-like transverse flagellum with multiple waves that beats to the cell's left, and a more conventional one, the longitudinal flagellum, that beats posteriorly. The transverse flagellum is a wavy ribbon in which only the outer edge undulates from base to tip, due to {{the action of the}} axoneme which runs along it. The axonemal edge has simple hairs that can be of varying lengths. The flagellar movement produces forward propulsion and also a turning force. The longitudinal flagellum is relatively conventional in appearance, with few or no hairs. It beats with only one or two periods to its wave. The flagella lie in surface grooves: the transverse one in the cingulum and the longitudinal one in the sulcus, although its distal portion <b>projects</b> <b>freely</b> behind the cell. In dinoflagellate species with desmokont flagellation (e.g., Prorocentrum), the two flagella are differentiated as in dinokonts, but they are not associated with grooves.|$|E
50|$|The {{reproductive}} system anatomically differs from genera Powelliphanta and Wainuia. There is remarkable extreme reduction of male organs in Paryphanta busbyi {{and the absence}} of receptaculum seminis (spermatheca). This is resemblance with Schizoglossa novoseelandica. There is a blunt, somewhat triangular, projection of the vaginal wall, with a retractor muscle proceeding to the adjoining body-wall; this is the only evidence of the male organs before any of the surrounding tissue has been dissected away. On removing this outer tissue a small loop is seen to project from the vaginal wall. This is the posterior termination of the penis, which passes into the vas deferens without any perceptible change, except a slight diminution of the tube. The anterior portion of the vagina forms a wide chamber, closed posteriorly by a valve-like papillar structure; the interior walls are slightly darkish in colour, and weakly longitudinally plicated. The papilla is continuously united with the vaginal wall, and the perforation through its centre is the only communication with the oviduct. Its anterior third <b>projects</b> <b>freely</b> into the anterior vaginal chamber. Its walls are comparatively thick; internally they are lightly longitudinally plicated, and have a whitish epitheloid lining.|$|E
60|$|Valves thin, white, translucent; upper {{layers of}} growth well preserved, {{excepting}} on the terga.

40|$|The pecten oculi of {{the black}} kite (Milvus migrans), a diurnally active bird of prey, has been {{examined}} by scanning electron microscopy. In this species the pecten consists of 12 highly vascularised pleats, held together apically by a heavily pigmented 'bridge' and <b>projects</b> <b>freely</b> into the vitreous body in the ventral part of the eye cup. Ascending and descending blood vessels of varying calibre, together with a profuse network of capillaries, essentially constitute the vascular framework of the pecten. A distinct distribution of melanosomes is discernible on the pecten, the concentration being highest at its apical end, moderate at {{the crest of the}} pleats and least at the basal and lateral margins. Overlying and within the vascular network, a close association between blood vessels and melanocytes is evident. It is conjectured that such an association may have evolved to augment the structural reinforcement of this nutritive organ in order to keep it firmly erectile within the gel-like vitreous. Such erectility may be an essential prerequisite for its optimal functioning, as well as in its overt use as a protective shield against the effects of ultraviolet light, which otherwise might lead to damage of the pectineal vessels...|$|E
40|$|Granzyme K (GzmK) {{belongs to}} a family of trypsin-like serine proteases {{localized}} in electron dense cytoplasmic granules of activated natural killer and cytotoxic T-cells. Like the related granzymes A and B, GzmK can trigger DNA fragmentation and is involved in apoptosis. We expressed the Ser(195) [...] >Ala variant of human pro-GzmK in Escherichia coli, crystallized it, and determined its 2. 2 -Angstrom x-ray crystal structure. Pro-GzmK possesses a surprisingly rigid structure, which is most similar to activated serine proteases, in particular complement factor D, and not their proforms. The N-terminal peptide Met(14) -Ile(17) <b>projects</b> <b>freely</b> into solution and can be readily approached by cathepsin C, the natural convertase of pro-granzymes. The pre-shaped S 1 pocket is occupied by the ion paired residues Lys(181 B) -Asp(194) and is hence not available for proper substrate binding. The Ser(214) -Cys(220) segment, which normally provides a template for substrate binding, bulges out of the active site and is distorted. With analogy to complement factor D, we suggest that this strand will maintain its nonproductive conformation in mature GzmK, mainly due to the unusual residues Gly(215), Glu(219), and Val(94). We hypothesize that GzmK is proteolytically active only toward specific, as yet unidentified substrates, which upon approach transiently induce a functional active-site conformation.

40|$|Should {{people be}} allowed to leave joint <b>projects</b> <b>freely</b> or should they be deterred from {{breaking}} off? This depends on why people stop collaborating and whether they have good reasons to do so. We explore the factors {{that lead to the}} breakdown of partnerships by studying a public good game with imperfect public monitoring and an exit option. In our experiment, subjects were assigned a partner with whom they could contribute over several periods to a public good with stochastic out- comes. They could choose in each period between participating in the public project or working on their own. We find there was excessive exit especially because subjects over-estimated the likelihood their partner would leave. Treatments with high barriers to exit generated higher welfare overall as they fostered stability and prevented inefficient breakdowns in relationships. There were differences across treatments in the intensity with which different factors drove the choice to work alone. Differences in expected payoffs between independent and group work were more important as a driver of exit in treatments with low barriers to exit. The intensity of other factors was more constant across treatments, including whether the common project failed in the previous period, the belief that one 4 s partner did not want to maintain the partnership and the belief that he exerted less effort than oneself...|$|E
