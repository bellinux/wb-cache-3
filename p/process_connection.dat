5000|$|To be {{representative}} of the average temperature of fluid, the thermowell must extend a few per cent of the inside diameter of the process pipe or vessel (Normally 1/3 rd of the pipe inside diameter). A rule of thumb that is sufficient for most industrial applications (approximately 1% accuracy) is to ensure that the thermowell projects 5 times its own diameter into the process plus the length of its sensing element. So, for a grounded thermocouple spring-loaded into a thermowell with a 1-inch-diameter shank and a tip thickness of [...]25 inch, a typical immersion length would equal 5.5 inches (1 inch OD x 5 + [...]25 inch well tip thickness +.25 inch sensor wall thickness = 5.5 inches). A thermowell is typically machined from solid bar stock and gun-drilled to ensure a long straight bore that closely approximates the diameter of the installed sensor (ex: a [...]260-inch bore matching a [...]250-inch sensor). A thermowell is typically mounted into the process stream by way of a threaded, welded, sanitary cap or flanged <b>process</b> <b>connection.</b> The temperature sensor such as a thermometer, thermocouple or resistance temperature detector is inserted in the open end of the thermowell and typically spring-loaded to ensure that the outside tip of the temperature sensor is in metal to metal contact with the inside tip of the thermowell.|$|E

The <b>process</b> <b>connection</b> for every substation directly re-flects the technology of the primary equipment. IEC 61850 provides a direct communication to the process.

The physical layout of the connections within the substation automation system is reduced to a communication network with only few connections to the process. A process con-nection according to IEC 61850 provides essential benefits. These benefits {{are discussed in the}} paper. However, there are also two main challenges related to that connection: (1) the real time behavior and (2) the accurate synchroniza-tion required for the instrument transformers.

Assuming saturated resource allocation on the downlink of WLAN and UMTS networks and a single QoS class of mobiles arriving at an average location in the hybrid cell, we formulate the problem with two different approaches: Global and Individual optimality. The Globally optimal association is formulated as an SMDP (Semi Markov Decision <b>Process)</b> <b>connection</b> routing decision problem where rewards comprise a financial gain component and an aggregate network throughput component.
