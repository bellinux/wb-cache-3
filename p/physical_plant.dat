5|$|ETNC's {{early success}} also {{attracted}} the attention of other communities in North Texas, and in 1904 Denison attempted to entice Mayo to relocate the college there for a considerable amount of financial aid. Whether or not Mayo seriously considered the offer is unknown, but he was able to use it as leverage to persuade Commerce to give the college $30,000 {{over the next three years}} for the promise that it would remain, money that was mostly used to renovate and expand ETNC's <b>physical</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E

5|$|Saint Anselm College RECYCLES was a {{greening}} movement {{which started}} on campus in 2009. Up to that time, recycling was limited on campus, and {{students had to}} resort to their own methods of recycling containers and other recyclables in dorms. An impromptu recycling program—Saint Anselm College RECYCLES—was started through the Knights of Columbus and the Club Soccer organization that served the Uppers section of campus, every Saturday, averaging around 650 pounds of material per week. In the 2010 spring semester, this plan funded by Club Soccer and the Knights of Columbus provided over fifty recycle bins, purchased from the city of Providence, Rhode Island. In the spring of 2010, the New Hampshire Institute of Politics installed seven recycling bins throughout its facilities. Inspired by this student-led activity, the college's <b>physical</b> <b>plant</b> purchased 120 bins for all of the apartments in the Uppers, Lowers and Falvey and Collins Houses. In the fall of 2010, <b>Physical</b> <b>Plant</b> installed five Waste Management recycling dumpsters throughout campus. Campus-wide recycling is planned by 2013.|$|E
5|$|Countries with {{decades of}} {{experience}} in comprehensive emergency medical systems have expertise that nations that are just beginning emergency medical programs lack. Thus, there exists considerable opportunity for the transfer of knowledge to assist newly founded programs. Such transfers may be made either from a distance or in person. For instance, the International Emergency Medicine Fellowship at the University of Toronto sent a three-person team to Cluj-Napoca, Romania, to promote the local development of emergency medicine. An assessment of the present status was performed that identified targets for improvement in <b>physical</b> <b>plant</b> organization and patient flow; staffing, staff education, equipment, medication and supplies; and infection control practices. Following these designations, plans regarding these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then implemented, partially through international exchange trips.|$|E
5|$|For much of {{its early}} life, the school {{consisted}} only of Nathan Smith and a small class of students, operating in borrowed space at Dartmouth College. Students of Smith were educated as apprentices, and received a Bachelor of Medicine degree upon graduation. Like Dartmouth College as a whole, the medical school had continual funding shortages. As time passed, however, the popularity of both the medical instruction and the basic sciences taught at the school drew undergraduates and training physicians alike. Soliciting funds {{from the state of}} New Hampshire, Smith was able to obtain medical equipment and, by 1811, a dedicated <b>physical</b> <b>plant</b> for the school.|$|E

5|$|The Thayer School {{is located}} on the campus of Dartmouth College, which is {{situated}} in the rural, Upper Valley New England town of Hanover, New Hampshire. The campus of the Thayer School sits in a complex on the west side Dartmouth's campus near the Connecticut River. When classes first began in 1871, Sylvanus Thayer's endowment had not provided for a <b>physical</b> <b>plant.</b> Consequently, the school was an itinerant institution for many years, occupying parts of various College buildings and, at one point, a former structure of the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts.|$|E
5|$|The university, {{which is}} built on high ground, served as an {{evacuation}} point and emergency shelter for thousands of flood refugees. The civil defense director of the university expected between 700 and 800 people to take shelter at the university. Between 7,000 and 8,000 showed up as the water rose through August 14 and 15 and crammed into facilities designed to house just over 1,000 students. A helipad {{was set up in}} a parking lot, and helicopters from Eielson Air Force Base ferried supplies to the refugees. Fairbanks' power plant was flooded, so the university depended on its <b>physical</b> <b>plant</b> to provide electricity for the refugees. When the rising water threatened to flood the plant, hundreds of the refugees massed to build barricades and pump out the plant's basement.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main gates to campus, at Cunningham Square (the {{intersection}} of River Avenue and Eaton Street) and on Huxley Avenue {{to the upper}} campus, and at {{the southeast corner of}} the lower campus, along Eaton Street. The campus consists of nineteen academic and administrative buildings, nine dormitories, five apartment complexes, three residences, four athletic buildings, a power plant, a <b>physical</b> <b>plant,</b> and a security office gate house. There is also a Dominican cemetery, two quads, four athletic fields, a six-court tennis court, an artificial turf field, and several parking areas (including a structure below the turf field).|$|E

5|$|However, it {{was soon}} {{revealed}} that the cannon had been appropriated by MIT {{in retaliation for the}} previous year's pranks, and relocated to Cambridge. The MIT team consisted of about 30 hackers, of which two flew to Pasadena and five drove cross-country. While acquiring the cannon disguised as construction contractors, the hackers had run-ins with a Caltech security guard and <b>physical</b> <b>plant</b> worker, to whom they explained that they were moving the cannon in preparation for the pouring of a concrete pedestal. Once off Caltech's campus, a local resident called in a noise complaint, and the Pasadena police arrived but did not recognize the then-disguised cannon. On the way to the shipping company, the trailer's hitch cracked, necessitating a slow trip on surface roads, and on arrival they were unable to physically remove the cannon from the trailer, causing them to spend an extra $1000 for the services of a company that specialized in moving large film props.|$|E

50|$|Although the anti-Somoza forces {{finally won}} their {{struggle}} in July 1979, {{the human and}} physical cost of the revolution was tremendous.

About US$500 million in <b>physical</b> <b>plants,</b> equipment, and materials was destroyed; housing, hospitals, transportation, and communications incurred damage of US$80 million.
