5|$|The <b>present</b> <b>form</b> of the {{doctrine}} seems to be unchanged {{at least since the}} time of Bhadrabahu (c. 300 BCE) who is respected by both the sects. This is supported by the fact that both Svetambara and Digambara sects agree on the basic doctrine, giving indication that it reached in its <b>present</b> <b>form</b> before the schism took place. Bhadrabahu is usually seen as the last leader of united Jain sangh. Detailed codification of types of karma and their effects were attested by Umasvati who is regarded by both Digambara and Svetambara as one of theirs.|$|E

5|$|An unusual {{element is}} that the tale draws its {{characters}} from essentially the same cast as Táin Bó Cuailnge, making mention of some thirty heroes from that narrative, yet never once mentions Cú Chulainn. Chadwick suggests this is probably {{an indication of the}} antiquity of the tradition of the story's tradition, predating the development of Cú Chulainn's story within the Ulster Cycle. Some of the rhetorical verse elements are old and obscure, but certain seemingly parodic elements of the genre at least suggest a later composition of the <b>present</b> <b>form.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following the {{acceptance}} of heliocentrism and equal hours, as well as advances in trigonometry, sundials appeared in their <b>present</b> <b>form</b> during the Renaissance, when they were built in large numbers. In 1524, the French astronomer Oronce Finé constructed an ivory sundial, which still exists; later, in 1570, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani published a treatise including instructions for the manufacture and laying out of mural (vertical) and horizontal sundials. Similarly, Giuseppe Biancani's Constructio instrumenti ad horologia solaria (c.1620) discusses how to construct sundials.|$|E

5|$|QED {{has served}} as the model and {{template}} for all subsequent quantum field theories. One such subsequent theory is quantum chromodynamics, which began in the early 1960s and attained its <b>present</b> <b>form</b> in the 1970s work by H.

Building on the pioneering work of Schwinger, Gerald Guralnik, Dick Hagen, and Tom Kibble, Peter Higgs, Jeffrey Goldstone, and others, Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam independently showed how the weak nuclear force and quantum electrodynamics could be merged into a single electroweak force.|$|E

50|$|The verb 'to be' is {{actually}} composed {{of three different}} stems:The <b>present</b> <b>forms</b> of wesan are almost never used. Therefore, wesan is used as the past, imperative, and present participle versions of sindon, and {{does not have a}} separate meaning. The bēon forms are usually used in reference to future actions. Only the <b>present</b> <b>forms</b> of bēon contrast with the <b>present</b> <b>forms</b> of sindon/wesan in that bēon tends to be used to refer to eternal or permanent truths, while sindon/wesan is used more commonly to refer to temporary or subjective facts. This semantic distinction (made only during the present tense) was lost as Old English developed into modern English, so that the modern verb 'to be' is a single verb which takes its <b>present</b> indicative <b>forms</b> from sindon, its past indicative forms from wesan, its <b>present</b> subjunctive <b>forms</b> from bēon, its past subjunctive forms from wesan, and its imperative and participle forms from bēon. (Modern German had an analogous, but even more complicated, development for its verb sein.) In late OE and ME, the form earon/earun, from the Old Norse erun, replaced bēoþ and sind (See also List of English words of Old Norse origin).|$|R
