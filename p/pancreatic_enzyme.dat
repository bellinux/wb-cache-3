40|$|Introduction Acute {{pancreatitis}} is {{an acute}} inflammatory {{process of the}} pancreas. It is usually associated with severe acute upper abdominal pain and elevated blood levels of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Serum amylase and lipase are common tests obtained as biochemical markers for acute pancreatitis. Pancreatitis, however, is not the sole cause of elevated <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Non-pancreatic causes of hyperamylasemia include inflammation or trauma to the salivary glands, bowel perforation or infarction, renal failure, abdominal trauma, and macroamylasemia. 2 An unusual cause of elevated <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes</b> is reported in this case report...|$|R

25|$|Amylase {{also has}} medical {{applications}} {{in the use of}} <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>Enzyme</b> Replacement Therapy (PERT). It is one of the components in Sollpura (Liprotamase) to help in the breakdown of carbohydrates into simple sugars.|$|E

25|$|Dietary fiber {{interacts with}} {{pancreatic}} and enteric enzymes and their substrates. Human <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity is reduced when incubated with most fiber sources. Fiber may affect amylase activity {{and hence the}} rate of hydrolysis of starch. The more viscous polysaccharides extend the mouth-to-cecum transit time; guar, tragacanth and pectin being slower than wheat bran.|$|E

25|$|Newborns with {{intestinal}} obstruction typically require surgery, whereas adults with distal {{intestinal obstruction}} syndrome typically do not. Treatment of pancreatic insufficiency by replacement of missing digestive enzymes allows the duodenum to properly absorb nutrients and vitamins {{that would otherwise}} be lost in the feces. However, the best dosage and form of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzyme</b> replacement is unclear, as are the risks and long-term effectiveness of this treatment.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} {{is usually}} treated with intravenous fluids, pain medication, and sometimes antibiotics. Typically no eating or drinking is allowed and a tube may be placed into the stomach. A procedure {{known as an}} endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be done to open the pancreatic duct if blocked. In those with gallstones the gallbladder is often also removed. In chronic pancreatitis, {{in addition to the}} above, temporary feeding through a nasogastric tube may be used to provide adequate nutrition. Long-term dietary changes and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzyme</b> replacement may be required. And occasionally surgery is done to remove parts of the pancreas.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} cure for cystic fibrosis. Lung infections {{are treated with}} {{antibiotics}} which may be given intravenously, inhaled, or by mouth. Sometimes, the antibiotic azithromycin is used long term. Inhaled hypertonic saline and salbutamol may also be useful. Lung transplantation may be an option if lung function continues to worsen. <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>enzyme</b> replacement and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation are important, especially in the young. Airway clearance techniques such as chest physiotherapy have some short-term benefit, but long-term effects are unclear. The average life expectancy is between 42 and 50 years in the developed world. Lung problems are responsible for death in 80% of people with cystic fibrosis.|$|E

40|$|Two {{normally}} developed Assyrian brothers with isolated pancreatic co-lipase deficiency are described. They {{presented at the}} age of 5 - 6 years with loose stools. They had steatorrhoea, and analysis of exocrine <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes</b> in the small intestine showed co-lipase deficiency, while amylase, chymotrypsin, trypsin and lipase were normal. Intraduodenal infusion of purified co-lipase improved fat digestion measured by the triolein breath test. Their steatorrhoea diminished on treatment with enteric-coated <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to examine the intestinal phase of cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion and gall bladder contraction in patients with severe pancreatic insufficiency. Plasma CCK concentrations, measured by radioimmunoassay, and gall bladder contraction by cholescintigraphy were studied in response to intraduodenal fat with and without addition of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Fasting plasma CCK concentrations {{were in the same}} range in six patients with pancreatic insufficiency with (2. 6 (0. 2) pmol/l) and without (2. 6 (0. 3) pmol/l) addition of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes</b> and in six healthy subjects (2. 0 (0. 4) pmol/l). The integrated plasma CCK secretion in response to intraduodenal fat was significantly (p less than 0. 005) reduced in the patients without addition of enzymes (46 (13) pmol/ 1. 90 min) compared with healthy subjects (199 (22) pmol/ 1. 90 min), but increased significantly (p less than 0. 01) by the addition of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes</b> (174 (25) pmol/ 1. 90 min) to values not significantly different from healthy subjects. Similarly, gall bladder emptying in response to intraduodenal fat was significantly (p less than 0. 01) reduced in patients with pancreatic insufficiency without addition of enzymes (at 90 min: 35 (11) %) compared with healthy subjects (at 90 min: 66 (7) %) but significantly (p less than 0. 01) increased by addition of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes</b> (at 90 min: 70 (8) %) to values not significantly different from healthy subjects. These results indicate that patients with severe pancreatic insufficiency have impaired gall bladder emptying after intraduodenal fat, which can be normalised by the addition of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes.</b> This impaired gall bladder emptying appears {{to be the result of}} a reduced plasma CCK response. Thus, intra-intestinal <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes</b> play an important role in the intestinal phase of CCK secretion and gall bladder emptying...|$|R
2500|$|In 1938, Dorothy Hansine Andersen {{published}} an article, [...] "Cystic Fibrosis of the Pancreas and Its Relation to Celiac Disease: a Clinical and Pathological Study", in the American Journal of Diseases of Children. [...] She {{was the first}} to describe the characteristic cystic fibrosis of the pancreas and to correlate it with the lung and intestinal disease prominent in CF. She also first hypothesized that CF was a recessive disease and first used <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzyme</b> replacement to treat affected children. In 1952, Paul di Sant’Agnese discovered abnormalities in sweat electrolytes; a sweat test was developed and improved over the next decade.|$|E
2500|$|While no {{cures for}} CF are known, several {{treatment}} methods are used. The management of CF [...] has improved significantly {{over the past}} 70 years. While infants born with it 70 years ago would have been unlikely to live beyond their first year, infants today are likely to live well into adulthood. Recent advances {{in the treatment of}} cystic fibrosis have meant that individuals with cystic fibrosis can live a fuller life less encumbered by their condition. The cornerstones of management are the proactive treatment of airway infection, and encouragement of good nutrition and an active lifestyle. Pulmonary rehabilitation as a management of CF continues throughout a person's life, and is aimed at maximizing organ function, and therefore the quality of life. At best, current treatments delay the decline in organ function. Because of the wide variation in disease symptoms, treatment typically occurs at specialist multidisciplinary centers and is tailored to the individual. Targets for therapy are the lungs, gastrointestinal tract (including <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzyme</b> supplements), the reproductive organs (including assisted reproductive technology), and psychological support.|$|E

50|$|Pancreatin {{contains}} the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes</b> trypsin, amylase and lipase. A similar mixture of enzymes is sold as pancrelipase, which contains more active lipase enzyme than does pancreatin.

40|$|Magnesium {{sulphate}} {{has previously}} {{been used as a}} purgative in a test involving the measurement of the faecal excretion of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes.</b> In order to validate the use of magnesium sulphate for this purpose, in 18 individuals the pancreatic and biliary response to intravenous infusion of secretin (1 CU/kg-h) plus CCK(1 IU/kg-h) were compared with the responses to one of three dose-rates of magnesium sulphate infused into the duodenum. The effect of magnesium sulhphate was also studied during the coincident intravenous administration of the hormones. Intraduodenal magnesium sulphate did not stimulate the secretion of bicarbonate into the duodenum but did evoke the secretion of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes</b> and discharge of bile. The pancreatic response to the exogenous hormones was not altered by coincident intraduodenal infusion of magnesium sulphate. We conclude that magnesium sulphate is a satisfactory purgative for speeding the intestinal transit of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes...</b>|$|R

50|$|Individuals with {{sphincter}} of Oddi dysfunction {{present with}} abdominal pain resembling that of structural or inflammatory disorders of the gallbladder, biliary tree or pancreas.

The disorder is classified into two subtypes: functional biliary sphincter of Oddi disorder, where there is no disturbance in <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzyme</b> measurements, such as amylase and lipase; and, functional pancreatic sphincter of Oddi disorder, where <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzyme</b> measurements are elevated.|$|E
50|$|After a total pancreatectomy, {{the body}} no longer {{produces}} its own insulin or <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes,</b> so patients {{have to take}} insulin and enzyme supplements.

Glycemic control is challenging even for relatively young and healthy apancreatic people, owing to the digestive challenges of not having endogenous insulin and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes</b> under autonomic control. It can be insurmountably challenging depending on age and comorbidities. But overall, {{quality of life in}} patients after total pancreatectomy is comparable with quality of life in patients who undergo a partial pancreatic resection.|$|R

Plasma CCK concentrations, measured by radioimmunoassay, and gall bladder contraction by cholescintigraphy were studied in response to intraduodenal fat with and without addition of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Fasting plasma CCK concentrations {{were in the same}} range in six patients with pancreatic insufficiency with (2. 6 (0. 2) pmoUl) and without (2 - 6 (0. 3) pmolIl) addition of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes</b> and in six healthy subjects (2 - 0 (04) pmol/l). The integrated plasma CCK secretion in response to intraduodenal fat was significantly (p< 0005) reduced in the patients without addition of enzymes (46 (13) pmoUl 190 min) compared with healthy subjects (199 (22) pmol/ 1. 90 min), but increased significantly (p< 001) by the addition of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>enzymes</b> (174 (25) pmolI 1 90 min) to values not significantly different from healthy subjects.
