40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides an}} insight of real option valuation application into {{real estate investment}} appraisal. Real estates investments have the features of low liquidity, slow payback and high sunk costs. This is especially the case appearing in emerging economics, due to the volatile demand, house <b>price</b> and <b>land</b> <b>costs.</b> The application of real options theory in real estate investment analysis considers a real estate development as an investment opportunity that reduces the uncertainties {{in the real estate}} development and creates economic value on real estate projects. A case study of a Chinese real estate development project "Jiangnan New Village" is conducted to illustrate the application of real option valuation to real estate investment appraisal in emerging real estate market. Binomial Tree approach is employed for real option valuation in the case study. The results lead to the conclusion that real options embedded in the real estate projects do create significant economic values on underlying project, and improve risk management of the project...|$|R

30|$|<b>Land</b> <b>costs</b> are {{of course}} a key to {{determining}} net returns for new investors. We collected data on <b>land</b> <b>costs</b> at their typical sale price per hectare as of 2011. However, these are in considerable flux, based on some depression in timberland markets currently, and the reverse for agricultural land markets. In theory, the LEV data should provide a measure of <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> that {{is close to the}} estimated <b>land</b> <b>prices,</b> if the inputs and discount rate were correct. However, the LEV was only close to the estimated local <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> in about half the cases, indicating that more than discounted timber returns are contributing to forest <b>land</b> <b>prices.</b> This would suggest that LEV is more useful in analysing alternative timber growing returns and management regimes than for estimating the total value of land, which has many components other than timber growing potential alone.|$|R
30|$|The {{returns for}} other {{traditional}} assets {{indicate that the}} returns that we calculated for forestry investments, even with <b>land</b> <b>costs</b> and environmental constraints, are quite competitive. The forestry returns were also less variable (although {{we did not have}} enough time series data to calculate standard deviations). Furthermore, <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> for agriculture <b>land</b> have increased considerably, and forest <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> moderately throughout the world, which would increase forest investment returns. For example, the US South NCREIF (2013) timber-land price series from 2000 to 2012 indicates that up to half the total price appreciation has been due to <b>land</b> <b>price</b> appreciation, which would effectively double US returns we calculated here. <b>Land</b> <b>price</b> appreciation in South America {{and other parts of the}} world also has been rapid, with <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> actually being even greater than in the USA.|$|R

In Brazil and Argentina, one probably can pay less for land that has absolute prohibition of forestry activities, but this amount is not clear. This fact would tend to make net rates of return with <b>land</b> <b>costs</b> in Brazil and Argentina somewhat higher than we calculated, but so indeterminate that our assumption of one base forest <b>land</b> <b>price</b> in each country was best.|$|R

The Commission argues {{that this will}} create strong incentives for more selective fishing practices; however, there is little information {{to allow us to}} predict likely changes in fishing behaviour. Using detailed historic observer and logbook data from English North Sea otter trawlers and information on fish <b>prices</b> and <b>landing</b> <b>costs,</b> we examine the potential impact of a discard ban combined with either effort controls or catch quotas on the landings of an average trip. We calculate fishing incomes {{based on the assumption that}} existing fishing behaviour and catch compositions are maintained and compare this with incomes calculated on the assumption that all unwanted catch can be avoided. The difference provides an estimate of the maximum possible financial incentive for fishers to adopt more selective fishing practices. The calculations suggest that a discard ban in isolation will generate little economic incentive to operate more selectively. When combined with effort controls, a reduction in fishing effort may result in a proportional reduction in unwanted catches, but an incentive to actively avoid this catch is unlikely to be generated. Catch quotas would generate much stronger economic incentives, but only for the avoidance of the five quota species. So, contrary to the aims of the reformed CFP, a discard ban may not result in a dramatic reduction in unmarketable catches of all species...|$|R

This is done {{this way for}} facilitating the modeling of how variables affect this activity, such as income, costs, rates of discount and yield. The reason for not considering the gains earned through technological progress {{is the lack of}} a specific dynamic model. This study was carried out aiming {{to get to know the}} forest rotation with values from the sixties (beginning of tax exemption programme) and current values (nineties) aiming to obtain wood for cellulose and charcoal production; to determine the moment of substitution of a population which presents the same yield and the same cost structure through time as well as to determine how many cuttings should be done until the final cycle; to determine how many cuttings should be done until substitution (substitution chain); to verify the sensitivity of the substitution time to variations in the discount rates, wood <b>prices,</b> yield, <b>land</b> <b>costs,</b> harvesting costs and coppice yield. The results were tested in a case study, employing the Gompertz Function to determine the population yield. The Current Net Value Method was used as a crieterion of economic decision. It has been concluded that: The forest rotation to produce charcoal in the sixties was at 13 years of age; the current rotation is at 7 years of age; the final cycle allows up to 13 cuttings, but considering the possibility of land leasing, the best alternative is to conduce the sproutings up to the third cutting; an increase in factors such as discount rates, wood prices and yield caused reduction of the cutting age; increase in <b>land</b> <b>costs</b> did not affect the cutting ages; increase in the logging cost increased the cutting ages; the substitution of population now a days happens after 3 cuttings, while in the sixties it happened after 2 cuttings due to the lesser loss; an increase in factors such as discount rates, wood prices, logging costs and coppice yield increased the number of cuttings before the substitution and increase in the yield caused reduction of the substitution age (number of cuttings) ...|$|R

Without an active prevention program, this weed will continue to spread and increase its negative ecological and economical impacts. Managing medusahead may seem expensive per acre, but when all the acres that are protected by managing an infestation are considered, the price is very reasonable. And, when taking into account the rising <b>land</b> <b>prices,</b> the <b>cost</b> of medusahead management to the individual livestock producer is rapidly becoming more reasonable compared to purchasing additional acreage to offset production losses from medusahead invasion.|$|R

The heat balance model finds the thermal cycle equipment sizes as well as the variation of the heat-to-power ratio with load. Finally the economic model does the cash-flow analysis to determing whether the project will yield a required rate-of-return to be economically viable. Simulations have been done using the model considering a number of sample load patterns with the prevailing cost factors in India.

40|$|A sharp rise {{in house}} prices became a {{political}} issue in Korea in the late 1980 's. It opened a heated debate among scholars and experts on the causes of house price rises. In the debate, a common belief was that high <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> {{had been one of}} the main causes of high house prices. In fact, the proportion of <b>land</b> <b>cost</b> in new house prices has steadily increased as the latter has risen in Korea during the past two decades. This research calls into question the notion underlying that common belief that <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> exist independently of housing development. Most policy measures are sought on the basis of this notion. This research argues that <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> are an outcome of conflicts between landowners and developers in the process of housing development. In exploring the idea that the determination of <b>land</b> <b>cost</b> for housing is a result of conflicts between landowners and developers, the research came to the question of what the source of conflicts is, a question of why and how the two actors enter into conflictive relations. It was a suggestion of Marx's concept of rent that surplus profits are the material source of conflicts; the ability of developers to create higher surplus profits provides possibility of landowners to demand more payments for their land; landowners' appropriation of increasingly larger portions of surplus profits then conditions the way developers produce housing; thus both enter into a conflictive and contradictory relationship. It was thus hypothesised that the rising <b>land</b> <b>cost</b> for housing has been primarily a result of that conflicting and contradictory interaction, which is permanently operating in housing development. However, how far and in what forms the conflict affects housing development and the determination of <b>land</b> <b>cost</b> are affected by social mediation of the interaction. Thus the research, the test of the above hypothesis, comprises two parts: the identification of the material aspect of the process by which landowners and developers entered into conflicting relations resulting in increasing <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> for housing as suggested in Marx's concept of rent; and the examination of political and economic circumstances in which social relations between the two actors were conditioned to leave that material process unregulated. This hypothesis was tested with reference to the case of housing development in Seoul during the 1970 's and 1980 's. The empirical examination disclosed that the rising <b>land</b> <b>cost</b> for housing in Korea has been due to the conflictive nature of the relationship between landowners and developers. Developers have created large surplus profits by exploiting rapidly growing speculative demand for housing and government housing programmes relying on private development; this have provided room for landowners to raise <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> such that increasingly larger portions of new house prices have been allocated to land cost; increasing government intervention have been unsuccessful in controlling this conflictive and contradictory process and the consequent spiral rises in <b>land</b> <b>cost</b> and house <b>prices</b> because of its inability to break from its self-financing housing development strategy; this inability has been due to historical circumstances which, characterised by strong state and weak labour relations and the subordination of finance to industrial capital, have conditioned housing development to be driven by the private appropriation of development gains...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{fundamental}} determinants of housing prices {{in three different}} developedcities in China. The main question addressed is whether fluctuations in the fundamentaldeterminants of housing prices {{around the world have}} an impact on housing prices inChina. The theoretical framework shows that housing prices in China are determined to alarge extent by stipulated factors that affect other big cities. They are: income per capita, interestrate, <b>land</b> <b>price,</b> construction <b>cost</b> and population and stock price. We use a linear regression model in our article. The empirical testing shows that these sixdeterminants used in Western countries are also applicable to Chinese real estate market. Most of them succeed in explaining the dynamics of housing prices. However, the resultsof the empirical testing are different among the three cities, so specific economic environmentof the three cities are necessary to understand the results. In our opinion, although some of the determinants fail to explain the fluctuations of housingprices, it is early to say there are bubbles due to the short history of Chinese real estatemarket.

Rising housing costs associated with the <b>price</b> of <b>land,</b> financing <b>costs</b> (to include down payment), materials, and construction perpetuate and cause an affordability problem for low-income households to purchase permanent housing assets. Great Falls has several organizations that are providing affordable housing options for the community, but these efforts are not enough to keep up with current demand. Alternative affordable housing options must be offered in Great Falls, to include a Community Land Trust (CLT), and an Individual Development Account (IDA) match savings program. The CLT and IDA programs would best address the community’s needs in a collaborative effort with various community entities. A coalition should be formed around the programs to generate support, enthusiasm, and resources to enable sustainable, desired change in the community. Without the CLT and IDA program in the community, an increased number of residents living in an asset poverty situation would occur.

30|$|Home {{price is}} made of two parts: <b>price</b> of <b>land</b> and the <b>cost</b> of the house.

Many factors are baked into <b>land</b> <b>price,</b> including proximity to amenities and land’s inherent quality (e.g., proximity to a shoreline, the mountains, etc.).
