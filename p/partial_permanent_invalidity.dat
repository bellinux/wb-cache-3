40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{construct}} and validate an indicator {{for evaluating the}} quality of care for femoral fractures, and to assess the contribution of the quality of health care as a determinant of <b>partial</b> <b>permanent</b> inability secondary to femoral fractures due to occupational accidents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted from January to December 1995 at Mexican Institute of Social Security. The instrument was designed with experts' contribution along different stages and validated using implicit criteria and factorial analysis. A case-control study was then conducted to evaluate the contribution of the quality of care to inability secondary to femoral fractures. Cases were 108 active workers with permanent inability secondary to femoral fracture; controls were 94 active workers with fracture of femur but no permanent inability. Logistic regression modeling was used to establish the association between quality of care and <b>partial</b> <b>permanent</b> inability, adjusting by relevant variables. RESULTS: The ultimate indicator of quality of care consisted of the following: Timely care, pre-surgical management, surgical management, and fracture complications. A final score over 229 points meant that the worker had received good quality of care. Workers getting 229 or less points had received poor quality of care. Forty-eight (44 %) cases and 66 (70 %) controls received good quality of medical care. The likelihood of <b>partial</b> <b>permanent</b> inability was almost three times higher among workers given poor quality of care (OR 2. 95; 95 % CI 1. 5 - 5. 5). According to the multivariate model, predictors of <b>partial</b> <b>permanent</b> inability were: Having exposed or epiphysiary fractures, being re-submitted to surgery, having less than 90 days of rehabilitation care, and receiving deficient medical care. CONCLUSIONS: The constructed instrument was validated. The level of the quality of care received by workers is a determining factor for the generation of <b>partial</b> <b>permanent</b> inability. In workers having femoral fractures, {{it is important to consider}} timely medical care and early rehabilitation, to reduce the high incidence and prevalence of this medical problem in Mexico.

The model is validated by comparing the numerical results and the experimental results obtained by Nahum in 1977. The proposed numerical model is promising even if some quantitative differences with the experimental results can be found {{due to the fact that}} all the inner organs are considered as a continuum (without sliding interfaces or fluid elements) and due to the geometrical difference between the head used in the experimental test and the head used as reference to build the numerical model.

40|$|Purpose: Blast-induced {{traumatic}} brain injury (bTBI) {{is one of the}} causes of death or <b>permanent</b> <b>invalidity</b> which can occur unexpectedly in both military and civilian populations. This study set out to conduct a combined Eulerian-Lagrangian computational analysis of the interaction between a single planar blast wave and a human head in order to assess the extent of intra-cranial shock wave generation and its potential for causing {{traumatic brain}} injury. Materials and Methods: To investigate the mechanical response of human brain to blast waves and to identify the injury mechanisms of TBI, a three-dimensional finite elementhead model consisting of the scalp, skull, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain was developed from the imaging data of a human head. The mechanical properties of brain tissue were obtained from the literature. Results: Throughout the loading regime, CSF acted as a protective layer for brain tissue by absorbing shear strain energy. Biomechanical loading of the brain was governed by direct wave transmission, structural deformations, and wave reflections from tissue-material interfaces. Conclusion: The brain experiences a complex set of direct and indirect loadings emanating from different sources (reflections from tissue interfaces and skull deformation) at different points of time. The flow dynamics strongly depend on geometry (shape, curvature) and structure (flexural rigidity, thickness) of a specimen and should be considered in understanding biomechanical loading pattern...|$|R

It {{is also the most}} expensive addictive disorder due to morbidity, mortality, societal and legal problems. Besides their involvement in alcohol-related fatalities, forensic scientists are also required to assess driving and working ability as well as <b>permanent</b> <b>invalidity</b> due to alcohol-related conditions. Greater knowledge of the genetic basis of alcoholism could improve prevention by identifying specific risk factors and mechanisms, leading to effective therapeutic strategies and eventually to personalized treatments. Methods: This overview of the recent scientific literature on the genetic basis of alcoholism summarizes the analytical strategies currently applied to the identification of candidate genes involved in alcohol-use disorders (AUDs) and discusses some genes and related phenotypes that have been shown to influence the risk of alcoholism. Results: Alcoholism is a complex heterogeneous genetic disease. It is a quantitative disorder, in which the combined incidence of multiple genetic factors and environmental factors varies from one subject to another. Family, twin and adoption studies indicate that 50 – 60 % of the risk of alcoholism is due to genetic factors. Risk loci for AUDs include both genes involved in alcohol pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as genes moderating neurophysiological responses such as impulsivity, disinhibition, sensation-seeking and externalizing behaviours.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} German miners' model of mutual {{insurance}} from its introduction in 1854 to its basic reformation in 1923. Its core feature was {{the provision of}} cash benefits for compensation of income losses due to temporary sickness and <b>permanent</b> <b>invalidity</b> or death of the bread-winner. The carriers of the insurance scheme, the Knappschaften, date back to medieval times, and the Knappschaft is still present today as the second pillar of the German statutory old-age insurance. This paper aims to establish the Knappschaft insurance's main characteristics in the period under consideration. These include, for example, compulsory membership, shared financing between employed miners and entrepreneurs, selfmanagement, financing based on earnings-related social insurance contributions, a strong emphasis of the insurance principle, and application of the pay-as-you-go mechanism. The organisational analysis is complemented quantitatively, on the one hand, by evidence on increasing generosity and, on the other hand, evidence on increasing financial distress substantiating the shadow side of a maturing pay-as-you-go based scheme. In particular, Knappschaften experienced all trends we commonly associate with today's systems {{in the second half}} of the 20 th century as early as in the 19 th century, even before the Bismarckian insurance was installed from 1883 on: Increasing social security spending, rising pensioners-tocontributors ratios, concentration and pressure on finances forcing Knappschaften to adjust their fiscal policy according to the mechanics of pay-as-you-go.

In recent years, the problem of hip fractures in the elderly has reached levels comparable only with those of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. The costs sustained for inpatient care and rehabilitation following hip fractures in the over- 65 s already exceed the hospital costs of all acute MIs in adults aged > 45 years and are comparable to the direct costs of all strokes (ischaemic/haemorrhagic/TIAs) in Italy. Similarly, hip fracture mortality is no lower than MI and stroke mortality. In 2008, a total of 74, 607 patients aged over 65 years were hospi-talised for hip fracture throughout Italy. These patients generated direct hospital costs of around 500 million euros/year plus a further 500 million euros for rehabilitation (making a total of over 1 billion euros/year). These costs are greater than those sustained for the hospitalisation and rehabilitation of MI and stroke patients aged over 45 years. An analysis of the Tuscan database of hospital discharge records on hip fractures highlighted the strong impact of this condition on the elderly and the considerable associated health costs: - Over 7, 000 fragility fractures of the hip in 2007 alone. - Around 20 % of elderly patients die within the first year. - Over 50 % of hip fracture patients never recover movement capacity and independence. - Around 20 % will suffer another hip fracture within 4 years. - 96 million euros in total direct costs to the regional heath service in 2007...|$|R

40|$|A stroke {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} causes of <b>permanent</b> <b>invalidity.</b> In the Netherlands, each year 41, 000 people are involved with a first stroke. A motor impairment which is commonly seen in stroke survivors is a drop foot. The abnormal, inefficient and unsafe walking pattern hinders patients to perform their activities of daily living, resulting in an impaired quality of life. In the past several solutions have been developed for the treatment of a drop foot. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) of the peroneal nerve {{is one of the}} treatment options that can be used. Although this concept has existed for more than 40 years, the use of FES is not widespread and the total number of patients being treated remains quite small. Several reasons can be responsible for this finding, such as technical limitations and unfamiliarity with FES in many countries. In addition there is still no hard evidence for the positive clinical effects of this treatment. An interesting aspect that has not been clarified yet is the additional value of peroneal nerve stimulation in comparison with the treatment that is normally given to stroke survivors, i. e. a passive walking device. The aim of the present thesis was to attribute to a more evidence based stroke rehabilitation regarding the correction of a drop foot by FES. A RCT was performed to evaluate the effect of an implantable two-channel peroneal nerve stimulator on impairment, disability and quality of life in comparison with the effect of the conventional treatment given to stroke survivors with a drop foot, in most cases an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO). Summarizing, the results of this thesis indicate that the STIMuSTEP is a clinical effective device in a selected group of chronic stroke subjects with a drop foot. When comparing this neuroprosthetic device with the standard of care, an AFO or orthopaedic shoes, a clinically relevant orthotic effect on mobility, ankle kinematics and quality of life was found. However, no convincing therapeutic effect of PNS was found in the present RCT...|$|R

A large collection of strains analyzed during a century of experimental work and unique genetic possibilities allow the exchange of genetically definable plastids, individual or multiple chromosomes, and/or entire haploid genomes (Renner complexes) between species. However, molecular genetic approaches for the genus are largely lacking. In this study, we describe the development of efficient PCR-based marker systems for both the nuclear genome and the plastome. They allow distinguishing individual chromosomes, Renner complexes, plastomes, and subplastomes.

Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the trend of work accidents in the Local Health Area No. 6 - Fabriano (Marche Region), during the period 2000 - 2003; to define the frequency for each job sector, age, gender, type of work, severity, month, day and week and time of day; to calculate the incidence rate for each year taken into consideration. METHODS: The sources of information used were: 1) The "New Informative Flows" database set up by Italian National Institute of Insurance for Occupational Injury (INAIL), Italian Superior Institute for Work Prevention and Safety (ISPESL) and Regional Governments, and the "EPIWORK software", for the total number of occupational accidents among immigrant workers. 2) The local Jobs and Training Centre of Fabriano. We used three different correction indexes to evaluate the number of hired workers so as to estimate the rate of accident incidence among immigrant workers. RESULTS: The total number of occupational accidents reached its peak in 2001 as a result of the rise in the number of employed people. After this date, the trend started to reverse and in 2002 an increase in the number of employed people [...] although smaller compared to the previous year [...] was accompanied by a reduction in the overall number of accidents, a reduction that became even more evident in 2003. Occupational accidents among immigrant workers gradually rose and peaked in 2002. The sectors with high rates of accidents were the mechanical engineering and metallurgic sectors and the construction industry. Accidents occurred mainly among young people (18 to 34 years old). As for gender, there was a marked prevalence of men (83. 3 %) over women (16. 7 %). Most accidents had a prognosis of 8 to 30 days.

40|$|Background The global {{decline of}} marine {{biodiversity}} {{and the perceived}} need to protect marine ecosystems from irreparable alterations to ecosystem functioning and ecosystem service provision have produced an extensive range of spatial management measures (SMMs). The design of SMMs is a complex process often involving the integration of both conservation objectives and socio-economic priorities and the resultant trade-offs are highly dependent on the management regime in place. Future marine management is likely to involve greater use of different forms of protected areas with differing levels of protection, particularly for sites where there are multiple competing demands. Consequently, evaluations of the characteristics that enable different forms of SMMs to successfully achieve their objectives are required to inform future conservation networks. The objective of this evidence-based analysis is to assess and compare the biological effects of different forms of SMMs {{with the aim of}} providing additional guidelines and insight into the design of future SMMs. Methods SMMs will be grouped into four main categories according to the degree of management enforcement (marine reserve, marine protected area, <b>partial</b> <b>permanent</b> protection, <b>partial</b> temporal protection). To identify and collate evidence to address these questions a comprehensive systematic search of peer-reviewed scientific literature and grey literature will be undertaken.

The discovery of a <b>partial</b> <b>permanent</b> maxillary juvenile dentition (OR- 1) from the Obi-Rakhmat Grotto, Uzbekistan, provides the opportunity to assess dental development and age at death in a Paleolithic hominin with strong Neanderthal similarities using incremental dental features. Long-period lines on tooth crowns (perikymata) and roots (periradicular bands) were quantified, and crown formation, root development, and age at death were estimated. An anomalous upper molar was determined to be a left M 2 with a rare developmental condition (gemination). Perikymata numbers for OR- 1 were similar to modern southern African population means, but were less than modern northern European and Neanderthal means. Root extension rates were estimated to be similar to (or slightly higher than) modern human values, although few modern comparative data are available. Assuming the long-period line periodicity of this individual fell within a Neanderthal distribution (6 – 9 days), the maximum age at death of OR- 1 is estimated at 8. 1 years, but is {{more likely to have been}} 6. 7 – 7. 4 years (7 or 8 day periodicity). Modern European human developmental standards would suggest an age at death of approximately 8 – 9 years. These results are consistent with other studies suggesting that Neanderthal dental development overlaps with the low end of modern human populations, and demonstrates a greater range of variation in Middle Paleolithic hominins than previously reported. It is clear that perikymata number alone does not distinguish these taxa; data on long-period line periodicity and molar eruption would yield additional insight into Neanderthal life history.

40|$|Abstract Background Return to work (RTW) after {{long-term}} {{sick leave}} {{can be a}} long-lasting process where the individual may shift between work and receiving different social security benefits, {{as well as between}} part-time and full-time work. This is a challenge in the assessment of RTW outcomes after rehabilitation interventions. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the probability for RTW, and the probabilities of transitions between different benefits during a 4 -year follow-up, after participating in a work-related rehabilitation program. Methods The sample consisted of 584 patients (66 % females), mean age 44 [*]years (sd[*]=[*] 9. 3). Mean duration on various types of sick leave benefits at entry to the rehabilitation program was 9. 3 [*]months (sd[*]=[*] 3. 4) ]. The patients had mental (47 %), musculoskeletal (46 %), or other diagnoses (7 %). Official national register data over a 4 -year follow-up period was analysed. Extended statistical tools for multistate models were used to calculate transition probabilities between the following eight states; working, partial sick leave, full-time sick leave, medical rehabilitation, vocational rehabilitation, and disability pension; (<b>partial,</b> <b>permanent</b> and time-limited). Results During the follow-up there was an increased probability for working, a decreased probability for being on sick leave, and an increased probability for being on disability pension. The probability of RTW was not related to the work and benefit status at departure from the rehabilitation clinic. The patients had an average of 3. 7 (range 0 – 18) transitions between work and the different benefits. Conclusions The process of RTW or of receiving disability pension was complex, and may take several years, with multiple transitions between work and different benefits. Access to reliable register data and the use of a multistate RTW model, makes it possible to describe the developmental nature and the different levels of the recovery and disability process. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Despite {{technological}} advances used in everyday clinical practice, injuries {{of the eye}} caused by various agents still produce blindness and poor vision in {{a significant number of}} people. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze factors leading to occurrence of mechanical injuries of the eye. Methods. Mechanic injuries of the eye in patients treated at the Institute for Eye Diseases of the Clinical Center of Serbia in Belgrade, in an eight-year period were analyzed. Investigated parameters were: sex and age of patients, their profession, time of injury (months, days and hours), place and way of injury and a visual acuity on admission and dismiss, as well as further follow-up. Type of injury (closed or opened injuries of the eyeball), with all the complications that followed were carefully noted and monitored. The time of primary surgical repair was noted and analyzed, whenever necessary. Results. In the period of eight years, 2701 patients (2 257 males and 444 females) were treated in the hospital due to mechanical injury of the eye. Almost equally, both the right (50. 5 %) and the left eye (49. 5 %) were injured, while in 39 (1. 4 %) patients both eyes were injured at the same time. The injuries occurred in all age groups, but mostly in adults, employed persons, aged from 16 to 65 (70 %). Among injured children, 18. 8 % were beyond the age of 15. Most frequent injuries occurred in workers (39 %), and then in pupils (16. 3 %). Wood was the mean of injury in 23. 7 % of cases, sharp and pointed objects in 16. 1 %, hammering and metal particles in 14. 4 %, glass in 10. 1 %, and other different objects in the rest of 35. 7 % of all injured persons. There were other very serious means or mechanisms of eye injuries, like hair band, dog bite, rooster’s beak, rubber bullet, etc. Considering months in the year and days in the week, the injuries were almost equally distributed, and related to the time of day even 75 % occurred between 10 a. m. and 10 p. m. Most injuries (38. 2 %) occurred while doing some work out of professional working place, while only 25. 4 % injuries occurred at the working place. Most of the patients (30. 3 %) had visual acuity L+P+ (light perception with correct projection) only, on attendance, but it varied from complete blindness to 1. 0. There were 1 282 blunt injuries (contusion) (47. 5 %) and 1 373 penetrating eyeball injuries (50. 8 %), while the rest (1. 7 %) were injuries of ocular adnexa. Most of the primary surgical treatments (63. 7 %) were done in the first 24 hours from the moment of the injury. At dismiss, visual acuity was normal in 53. 2 %, the eye was blind in 19. 1 % injured patients. Conclusion. The results of this study showed that the injuries occurred most frequently in actively working people and pupils, that men were injured five times more often than women; that wood, sharp objects and glass were the most common means, that there was an equal number of blunt injuries and penetrating wounds, and that it was very important to treat injury promptly, preferably within the first 24 hours. By further analysis, it might be concluded that many injuries could have been prevented, avoiding long medical treatment and accompanying costs, and what is most important - <b>permanent</b> <b>invalidity</b> caused by reduced visual function or blindness of the injured eye is avoidable...|$|R
