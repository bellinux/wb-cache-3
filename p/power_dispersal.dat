In Essay Two, empirical evidence on a number of political theories of public debt determination is presented. First, it is shown that during the Great Depression, budget deficit persistence was more marked in nations with coalition governments, in accord with the <b>power</b> <b>dispersal</b> theory. Second, Granger-prediction tests are used to test whether large deficits predict future government spending in a sample of industrialized democracies. Finally, a pooled cross-section time series regression analysis reconfirms previous findings that <b>power</b> <b>dispersal</b> is a factor in explaining post- 1973 budget deficit persistence in a number of countries but it is also found that the degree of central bank independence is a significant influence...|$|E
40|$|Pollen-mediated {{gene flow}} was {{measured}} in two populations of black cottonwood using direct (paternity analysis) and indirect (correlated paternity) methods. The Marchel site was an area with an approximate radius of 250 m in a large continuous stand growing in a mesic habitat in western Oregon. In contrast, the Vinson site was an area with a radius of approximately 10 km and consisted of small, disjunct and isolated stands in the high desert of eastern Oregon. Pollen immigration was extensive in both populations, and was higher in the Marchel site (0. 54 +/- 0. 02) than in the substantially larger and more isolated Vinson site (0. 32 +/- 0. 02). Pollen pool differentiation among mothers was approximately five times stronger in the Vinson population (Phi FT = 0. 253, N = 27 mothers) than in the Marchel population (Phi FT = 0. 052, N = 5 mothers). Pollen dispersal was modelled using a mixed dispersal curve that incorporated pollen immigration. Predicted pollination frequencies generated based on this curve were substantially more accurate than those based on the widely used exponential <b>power</b> <b>dispersal</b> curve. Male neighbourhood sizes (sensu Wright 1946) estimated using paternity analysis and pollen pool differentiation were remarkably similar. They were {{three to five times}} smaller in the Vinson population, which reflected the substantial ecological and demographic differences between the two populations. When the same mathematical function was used, applying direct and indirect methods resulted in similar pollen dispersal curves, thus confirming the value of indirect methods as a viable lower-cost alternative to paternity analysisPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{objective of}} this thesis is to identify the factors responsible for {{the persistence of the}} Chilean inflation and, particularly, for the failure of the three main stabilization efforts which took place under democratic conditions in Chile, i. e. those implemented in 1956 - 57, 1959 - 61 and 1965 - 67. In this thesis, the Chilean inflation of 1955 - 1970 is considered to have been, to a large extent, the result of the failure of the political system to accommodate conflicting demands within the limits of available resources. The analysis of the literature about the Chilean inflation shows that the economic approaches fail to take socio-political factors into account, and that the literature which focuses on the non-economic aspects of the phenomenon is varied, less formalized and, in general, more concerned with the sociological aspects of the conflicts which existed in Chilean society than with the political and particularly the institutional aspects involved. This thesis attempts to overcome these shortcomings by placing the Chilean inflationary process in its specific institutional and political context. This approach shows how important the contribution of socio-political analysis can be to the understanding of inflation, particularly in historically and geographically bound case studies. The thesis concentrates considerable effort on the analysis of the connection between the cyclical pattern of the Chilean inflation, the cyclical socio-political forces at work in the Chilean society and their institutional framework. The thesis argues that under democratic conditions the inflationary propensity which existed in Chilean society had both an upper and lower limit. The analysis of the record for 1955 - 1970 shows that there were forces working in favour of price stabilization that became more powerful as inflation accelerated, but there were also countervailing forces favouring the continuation of inflation and these came to prevail as inflation decelerated. The cyclical character of the Chilean inflation was partly related to the cyclical pattern of the six year presidential terms which involved alternating periods of strong and centralized presidential authority and of <b>power</b> <b>dispersal.</b> The Chilean inflation {{was the result of a}} society still searching for effective forms of social regulation, alternative to the traditional ones which started to collapse in the 1920 s. </p...|$|E

60|$|Why Easily-Dispersed Plants {{have often}} Restricted Ranges.--This last {{consideration}} throws {{light on a}} very curious point, which has been noted as a difficulty by Sir Joseph Hooker, that plants which have most clear and decided <b>powers</b> of <b>dispersal</b> by wind or other means, have not generally the widest specific range; and he instances {{the small number of}} Compositæ common to New Zealand and Australia. But in all these cases it will, I think, be found that although the species have not a wide range the genera often have. In New Zealand, for instance, the Compositæ are very abundant, there being no less than 167 species, almost all belonging to Australian genera, yet only about one-sixteenth of the whole are identical in the two countries. The explanation of this is not difficult. Owing to their great <b>powers</b> of <b>dispersal,</b> the Australian Compositæ reached New Zealand at a very remote epoch, and such as were adapted to the climate and the means of fertilisation established themselves; but being highly organised plants with great flexibility of organisation, they soon became modified in accordance with the new conditions, producing many special forms in different localities; and these, spreading widely, soon took possession of all suitable stations. Henceforth immigrants from Australia had to compete {505} with these indigenous and well-established plants, and only in a few cases were able to obtain a footing; whence it arises that we have many Australian types, but few Australian species, in New Zealand, and both phenomena are directly traceable to the combination of great <b>powers</b> of <b>dispersal</b> {{with a high degree of}} adaptability. Exactly the same thing occurs with the still more highly specialised Orchideæ. These are not proportionally so numerous in New Zealand (thirty-eight species), and this is no doubt due to the fact that so many of them require insect-fertilisation often by a particular family or genus (whereas almost any insect will fertilise Compositæ), and insects of all orders are remarkably scarce in New Zealand.[136] This would at once prevent the establishment of many of the orchids which may have reached the islands, while those which did find suitable fertilisers and other favourable conditions would soon become modified into new species. It is thus quite intelligible why only three species of orchids are identical in Australia and New Zealand, although their minute and abundant seeds must be dispersed by the wind almost as readily as the spores of ferns.|$|R

60|$|The chief {{types of}} {{flowering}} plants have existed during {{the millions of}} ages of the whole tertiary period, and during this enormous lapse of time many of them may have been modified {{in the direction of}} insect fertilisation, and again into that of self-fertilisation, not once or twice only, but perhaps scores or even hundreds of times; and at each such modification a difference in the environment may have led to a distinct line of development. At one epoch the highest specialisation of structure in adaptation to a single species or group of insects may have saved a plant from extinction; while, at other times, the simplest mode of self-fertilisation, combined with greater <b>powers</b> of <b>dispersal</b> and a constitution capable of supporting diverse physical conditions, may have led to a similar result.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of morphometric {{measurements}} of 69 Carabidae species, the <b>dispersal</b> <b>power</b> of beetles {{at different stages of}} their physiological development was estimated. As quantitative criteria for estimation of dispersal possibilities the indices of potential migrants (Ipm) and conventional load on the wing (Pf) were introduced. Among constantly macropterous cara-bids, three groups of beetles with different levels of wing muscles development were distinguished. Monomorphic macropterous (MMm) species are characterized by the highest flight activity of both sexes throughout imago stage. Though in many di(poly) morphic carabids (DPM species) a proportion of macropterous females in the populations is large, the wing muscles are better developed in macropterous males, which ensures similar migration possibilities of males and females. In populations of polymorphic macropterous (MPm) and DPM species dispersion is carried out mostly by teneral and im-mature beetles. The maximum loss in flight ability occurs in mature females with developed eggs in ovaries. Large species of ground beetles produce relatively large eggs, which are deposited in a single batch. After the development of gonads, body mass in these species increases sharply, while wing muscles decline. In small-sized carabid species gonads develop gradually and they lay relatively small eggs continuously. The changes in body mass in these species are usually small. Therefore, the temporal changes in the Pf-index are more pronounced in large- and medium-sized carabid species com-pared to small-sized beetles.

60|$|We have, however, on {{the other}} hand, {{overwhelming}} evidence that in many cases, among our domestic animals and cultivated plants, close interbreeding does produce bad results, and the apparent contradiction may perhaps be explained on the same general principles, and under similar limitations, as {{were found to be}} necessary in defining the value of intercrossing. It appears probable, then, that it is not interbreeding in itself that is hurtful, but interbreeding without rigid selection or some change of conditions. Under nature, {{as in the case of}} the Porto Santo rabbits, the rapid increase of these animals would in a very few years stock the island with a full population, and thereafter natural selection would act powerfully in the preservation only of the healthiest and the most fertile, and under these conditions no deterioration would occur. Among the aristocracy there has been a constant selection of beauty, which is generally synonymous with health, while any constitutional infertility has led to the extinction of the family. With domestic animals the selection practised is usually neither severe enough nor of the right kind. There is no natural struggle for existence, but certain points of form and colour characteristic of the breed are considered essential, and thus the most vigorous or the most fertile are not always those which are selected to continue the stock. In nature, too, the species always extends over a larger area and consists of much greater numbers, and thus a difference of constitution soon arises in different parts of the area, which is wanting in the limited numbers of pure bred domestic animals. From a consideration of these varied facts we conclude that an occasional disturbance of the organic equilibrium is what is essential to keep up the vigour and fertility of any organism, and that this disturbance may be equally well produced either by a cross between individuals of somewhat different constitutions, or by occasional slight changes in the conditions of life. Now plants which have great <b>powers</b> of <b>dispersal</b> enjoy a constant change of conditions, and can, therefore, exist permanently, or at all events, for very long periods, without intercrossing; while those which have limited <b>powers</b> of <b>dispersal,</b> and are restricted to a comparatively small and uniform area, need an occasional cross to keep up their fertility and general vigour. We should, therefore, expect that those groups of plants which are adapted both for cross-and self-fertilisation, which have showy flowers and possess great powers of seed-dispersal, would be the most abundant and most widely distributed; and this we find to be the case, the Compositae possessing all these characteristics in the highest degree, and being the most generally abundant group of plants with conspicuous flowers in all parts of the world.|$|R
