50|$|Hunting of the <b>plain</b> <b>chachalaca</b> is {{restricted}} to subsistence hunting, for example by the Mayan people in southern Mexico. The <b>plain</b> <b>chachalaca</b> population is 500,000-5,000,000 (2006 IUCN Red List). It is not threatened. However the subspecies from Útila Island, O. v. deschauenseei, has sometimes been listed as extinct, but recent surveys have confirmed that it still survives.|$|R
5000|$|Utila chachalaca (Ortalis vetula deschauenseei), {{subspecies}} of the <b>plain</b> <b>chachalaca</b> from Honduras, {{not recorded}} between 1963 and 2000 and confirmed photographically in 2005.|$|R
50|$|This species frequents dry {{and moist}} forests, {{especially}} where interspersed with scrub and savanna. Usually found {{in groups of}} up to 15 birds, the <b>plain</b> <b>chachalaca</b> is furtive and wary and prefers to escape from danger by running swiftly {{on the ground or}} leaping and gliding through brushy tangles. The <b>plain</b> <b>chachalaca</b> feeds in trees or on the ground on fruit (figs, palms, Sapotaceae), seeds, leaves, and flowers. It is sometimes a pest of crops such as tomatoes and cucumbers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{generic name}} {{is derived from}} the Greek word όρταλις, meaning [...] "pullet" [...] or [...] "domestic hen." [...] The common name is an onomatopoeia for the four-noted cackle of the <b>plain</b> <b>chachalaca</b> (O. vetula).|$|R
50|$|It can {{be mistaken}} for the <b>plain</b> <b>chachalaca,</b> O. vetula, which has an {{isolated}} population that overlaps in northern Costa Rica, but it is larger, more rufous below, has a white tail tip, and lacks rufous in the wings.|$|R
50|$|The <b>plain</b> <b>chachalaca</b> {{is mostly}} diurnal and is most active in cool mornings {{and in the}} evening. It is mostly {{inactive}} during {{the heat of the}} day. Pairs or family groups roost communally in trees, usually on a branch, often touching, and facing the same way.|$|R
50|$|The chachalacas, guans and {{curassows}} are {{birds in}} the family Cracidae. These are species of tropical and subtropical Central and South America. One species, the <b>plain</b> <b>chachalaca,</b> just reaches southernmost Texas in the USA. Two species, the Trinidad piping guan and the rufous-vented chachalaca occur on the islands of Trinidad and Tobago respectively.|$|R
50|$|The coastal plains {{along the}} Gulf {{have a large}} {{presence}} in the state, whereas inland the landscape is adorned by cactus species and pasture.

50|$|The <b>plain</b> <b>chachalaca</b> (Ortalis vetula) {{is a large}} bird in the chachalaca, guan and curassow family Cracidae. It breeds in {{tropical}} and subtropical environments from mezquital thickets in the Rio Grande Valley in southernmost Texas, United States to northernmost Costa Rica. In Central America, this species occurs in the Pacific lowlands from Chiapas, Mexico to northern Nicaragua and as a separate population in Costa Rica, where its range is separated by a short distance, as a disjunct population.|$|R
50|$|The <b>plain</b> <b>chachalaca</b> {{is found}} from Texas, in the Lower Rio Grande, through the eastern coast of Mexico, the Yucatan Peninsula, Belize, {{northern}} Guatemala, northern Honduras and just {{into the north}} central part of Nicaragua, with a small population on the Nicoya Peninsula of northern Costa Rica. The species has also been introduced and established to San Patricio County in Texas and three islands, Sapelo, Blackbeard and Little St. Simons Island, {{on the coast of}} Georgia.|$|R
50|$|The call is a loud, raucous RAW-pa-haw or cha-cha-LAW-ka, {{often by}} several birds in a rhythmical chorus, {{especially}} in early morning and evening, usually from well up in trees. It also produces peeping whistles and cackles. Others describe chachalaca calls as irritating noises mimicking {{a bunch of}} men arguing. The <b>plain</b> <b>chachalaca</b> typically breeds in the early wet season. The nest is a shallow saucer of twigs and plant fibers, lined with leaves, in thick vegetation. The clutch is 2-4 rough-shelled white to cream eggs.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>plain</b> <b>chachalaca</b> is {{a medium}} sized galliform , around {{the size of}} a common pheasant. It {{measures}} 48 - 58 cm in length, and varies in weight from 468 - 794 g for males and 439 - 707 gin females [...] Males are on average larger but because of overlap that isn't diagnostic of sex, and in appreance they are the same. It is long-necked with a small head and bare throat patch which becomes deep red in both sexes during the breeding season. Adults have a greyish head and neck with a dull olive-brown body and wings. The underbelly is pale to ochraceous and the tail is blackish with green gloss and buffy-white tip. The iris is brown and bill is black; orbital skin and the feet are dull grey.|$|R
50|$|It {{feeds on}} large {{invertebrates}} and small vertebrates, with small birds {{making up the}} overwhelming bulk of its prey. Mixed-species feeding flocks in open cerrado and grassland will go on frenzied alert upon spotting this species; small birds fear it more than most other predators. It is often seen soaring at twilight hunting insects and eating them on the wing. It also hunts at fields being burned, at which many birds of this species may gather; cooperation between individual aplomado falcons - usually members of a pair - has also been recorded. In Brazil, aplomado falcons have been observed following maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and chasing birds that the wolves flush. Prey items typically weigh one-fifth to one-half of the falcons' own weight, but females of this species (which due to their size can tackle larger prey) have been recorded eating birds larger than themselves, such as a cattle egret (Bulbucus ibis) or a <b>plain</b> <b>chachalaca</b> (Ortalis vetula), on rare occasions.|$|R
50|$|The grey-headed chachalaca is less noisy than <b>plain</b> or rufous-vented <b>chachalacas.</b> It has a peeping white, white, white contact {{call and}} {{a chorus of}} raucous kraaak sounds, but does not give the chachalaca call of its relatives.|$|R
50|$|Bladen has {{two large}} {{resident}} game bird species, the great curassow (Crax rubra) and crested guan (Penelope purpurascens). Both these species, {{along with their}} more common relative, the <b>plain</b> <b>chachalaca,</b> are representatives of the Cracidae family - the most threatened of the Neotropical bird families and common hunting targets. Cracids are important seed dispersers and are a major protein source for local communities. Within Belize, both the curassow and the guan are locally common, and outside of protected areas such as Bladen, they are legal game species for those with hunting permits. However, the increase in agricultural colonists and seasonal Central American workers adjacent to the nature reserve has led to increased illegal hunting within the protected area, resulting in reduced populations of both species. This was noted by the 1992 and 1997 expeditions to Columbia River Forest Reserve directly south of Bladen, with reports that game species were unexpectedly scarce in even the upper elevations, suggesting increasing hunting pressure, with relatively easy access from Guatemala. Whether this is impacting Bladen itself is currently unknown, but the implications are that these areas, once considered pristine, should now be considered under threat. This pronounced negative response to hunting pressure makes these two species especially valuable as indicator species in areas where hunting still occurs.|$|R
40|$|To {{define the}} process of karyotypic {{evolution}} in the Galliformes on a molecular basis, we conducted genome-wide comparative chromosome painting for eight species, i. e. silver pheasant (Lophura nycthemera), Lady Amherst's pheasant (Chrysolophus amherstiae), ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), Western capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), Chinese bamboo-partridge (Bambusicola thoracica) and common peafowl (Pavo cristatus) of the Phasianidae, and <b>plain</b> <b>chachalaca</b> (Ortalis vetula) of the Cracidae, with chicken DNA probes of chromosomes 1 - 9 and Z. Including our previous data from five other species, chicken (Gallus gallus), Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) and blue-breasted quail (Coturnix chinensis) of the Phasianidae, guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) of the Numididae and California quail (Callipepla californica) of the Odontophoridae, we represented the evolutionary changes of karyotypes in the 13 species of the Galliformes. In addition, we compared the cytogenetic data with the molecular phylogeny of the 13 species constructed with the nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, and discussed {{the process of}} karyotypic evolution in the Galliformes. Comparative chromosome painting confirmed the previous data on chromosome rearrangements obtained by G-banding analysis, and identified several novel chromosome rearrangements. The process of the evolutionary changes of macrochromosomes in the 13 species was in good accordance with the molecular phylogeny, and the ancestral karyotype of the Galliformes is represented...|$|R
40|$|The Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of Texas is an ecologically diverse {{region in}} the United States and marks the northernmost {{extension}} for many tropical species of plants and animals. Since the early 1900 s, 95 % of the native Tamaulipan brushlands have been cleared due to agricultural practices and urban development. The <b>plain</b> <b>chachalaca</b> (Ortalis vetula) is a medium sized bird endemic to the native brushlands of the LRGV. In 2003, I trapped and radio-tagged 29 birds (16 males, 13 females) to evaluate the effects of fragmentation on the population dynamics (i. e., survival, mortality, and movements) of this brushland species. My study objectives were to estimate (1) seasonal survival of chachalacas by sex, and (2) ranges, core areas, and movements using radio telemetry. Mammalian predation (43 %, n = 6) and unknown (43 %, n = 6) deaths accounted {{for the majority of}} mortality observed. I found no difference (P > 0. 05) in estimated 8 -month survival (December 2003 -July 2004) between males (S = 0. 364, SE = 0. 132) and females (S = 0. 405, SE = 0. 153). In comparing seasonal survival for all birds (males and females combined), I observed a difference (P < 0. 05) in survival between the nesting (S = 0. 414, SE = 0. 103) and breeding seasons (S = 0. 917, SE = 0. 079). Female ranges (x? = 117 ha, range = 42 ? 177 ha) and core areas (x? = 23 ha, range = 5 ? 46 ha) during the nesting season were larger than male ranges (x? = 41 ha, range = 31 ? 46 ha) and core areas (x? = 10 ha, range = 7 ? 14 ha) during the same period. During the breeding season, female ranges (x? = 59 ha, range = 10 ? 188 ha) and core areas (x? = 9 ha, range = 2 ? 33 ha) were similar to male ranges (x? = 48 ha, range = 4 ? 130 ha) and core areas (x? = 9 ha, range = 1 ? 23 ha). Mean distances between seasons were similar for both sexes (females, nesting, x? = 486, breeding, x? = 345; males, nesting, x? = 184, breeding, x? = 292), though females distances generally were greater. Dispersal defined as movement off the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge was observed for 3 birds. In 2 cases, a radio-tagged female and male were observed crossing the Rio Grande River (approximately 100 -m wide) to habitat in Mexico. Study results suggested mammalian predation may limit the growth of chachalaca populations. Though land use changes such as agricultural uses may not directly limit chachalaca populations in providing cover and food, concentration of populations in remnant native brushlands may serve as ecological ?sinks? to the species. Greater range and movement data observed in my study may be attributed to suboptimal habitat (i. e., increased fragmentation) for <b>plain</b> <b>chachalacas...</b>|$|R
