40|$|During {{bread baking}} gliadin and {{glutenin}} form large gluten protein aggregates. In the baking phase glutenin becomes almost unextractable. Oxidizing agents (<b>potassium</b> iodate and <b>bromate)</b> increase both α- and γ-gliadin extractability during baking, while a reducing agent (glutathione) decreases {{the levels of}} extractable α- and γ-gliadins. It is concluded that during baking, gluten polymerizes through a sulfhydryl-disulfide exchange mechanism. Oxidizing agents hinder gliadin-glutenin linking during baking by reducing the level of free sulfhydryl groups, while addition of glutathione increases the level of gliadin to glutenin covalent binding. These findings demonstrate that redox agents exert an effect during baking with a possible impact on final product quality. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|IBX or 2-iodoxybenzoic acid is {{an organic}} {{compound}} used in organic synthesis as an oxidizing agent. This periodinane is especially suited to oxidize alcohols to aldehydes. IBX is prepared from 2-iodobenzoic acid, <b>potassium</b> <b>bromate</b> and sulfuric acid. [...] Frigerio and co-workers have also demonstrated, in 1999 that <b>potassium</b> <b>bromate</b> may {{be replaced by}} commercially available Oxone. [...] One of the main drawbacks of IBX is its limited solubility; IBX is insoluble in many common organic solvents. In the past, {{it was believed that}} IBX was shock sensitive, but it was later proposed that samples of IBX were shock sensitive due to the residual <b>potassium</b> <b>bromate</b> left from its preparation. Commercial IBX is stabilized by carboxylic acids such as benzoic acid and isophthalic acid.|$|E

50|$|Dehydroascorbic {{acid and}} <b>potassium</b> <b>bromate</b> are oxidants, acting on {{sulfhydryl}} groups and disulfide bonds in wheat dough, in particular oxidizing glutathione. <b>Potassium</b> <b>bromate</b> acts more directly or with fewer chemical conversion steps than ascorbic acid. Glutathione increases wheat dough's extensibility, or relaxes it, while oxidizing a dough's glutathione increases elasticity. Like glutathione, cysteine and bisulfite are reducing agents which relax wheat dough. Adding minute amounts of oxidants or reducing agents alter the post-mix handling characteristics of dough.|$|E

50|$|The flour used {{in white}} breads may be bleached—that is, {{lightened}} further—by {{the use of}} chemicals such as <b>potassium</b> <b>bromate,</b> azodicarbonamide, or chlorine dioxide gas to remove any slight, natural yellow shade and make its baking properties more predictable.

50|$|Although banned for use {{in foods}} by many countries, <b>potassium</b> <b>bromate</b> is {{typically}} used in the United States as a flour improver (E number E924). It acts to strengthen the dough and to allow higher rising. It is an oxidizing agent, and under the right conditions will be completely used up in the baking bread. However, if too much is added, or if the bread is not baked long enough or not at a high enough temperature, then a residual amount will remain, which may be harmful if consumed. <b>Potassium</b> <b>bromate</b> might also {{be used in the}} production of malt barley, for which application the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has prescribed certain safety conditions, including labeling standards for the finished malt barley product.

50|$|Boris Belousov first noted, {{sometime}} in the 1950s, that in a mix of <b>potassium</b> <b>bromate,</b> cerium(IV) sulfate, propanedioic acid and citric acid in dilute sulfuric acid, the ratio of concentration of the cerium(IV) and cerium(III) ions oscillated, causing the colour of the solution to oscillate between a yellow solution and a colorless solution. This {{is due to the}} cerium(IV) ions being reduced by propanedioic acid to cerium(III) ions, which are then oxidized back to cerium(IV) ions by bromate(V) ions.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} of the phenomenon is credited to Boris Belousov.

Iodosylbenzene is used in organic oxidations. Dess-Martin periodinane (1983) is another powerful oxidant and an improvement of the IBX acid already in existence in 1983. The IBX acid is prepared from 2-iodobenzoic acid and <b>potassium</b> <b>bromate</b> and sulfuric acid [...] and is insoluble in most solvents whereas the Dess-Martin reagent prepared from reaction of the IBX acid with acetic anhydride is very soluble. The oxidation mechanism ordinarily consists of a ligand exchange reaction followed by a reductive elimination.|$|E
5000|$|More recently, and {{especially}} in smaller retail bakeries, chemical additives are used that both speed up mixing time and reduce necessary fermentation time, so that a batch of bread may be mixed, made up, risen, and baked in fewer than three hours. Dough that does not require fermentation because of chemical additives is called [...] "quick bread" [...] by commercial bakers. Common additives include reducing agents such as L-cysteine or sodium metabisulfite, and oxidants such as <b>potassium</b> <b>bromate</b> or ascorbic acid. Often these chemicals are added to dough {{in the form of}} a prepackaged base, which also contains most or all of the dough's non-flour ingredients. Using such bases and sophisticated chemistry, it has been possible for commercial bakers to make imitations of artisan and sourdough breads, traditionally made by semi-skilled laborers working in smaller shops.Since 1986, domestic breadmakers that automate the process of making bread have become popular in the home.|$|E

40|$|This study {{determined}} the levels and hepatic effects of <b>Potassium</b> <b>bromate</b> in Bread samples sold in Awka Metropolis, Nigeria. <b>Potassium</b> <b>bromate</b> is an additive widely employed by bread makers to improve bread quality.
