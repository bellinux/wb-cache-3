5|$|Demonstrative pronouns {{distinguish}} between <b>proximate</b> and remote. When they occur independently, they inflect for number. They {{may also be}} suffixed to nouns, e.g. /tabardaja/ 'this pack-saddle'.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa distinguishes {{two types}} of {{grammatical}} third person in sentences, marked on both verbs and animate nouns. The <b>proximate</b> form indicates a more salient noun phrase, and obviative indicates a less prominent noun phrase. Selection and use of <b>proximate</b> or obviative forms is a distinctive aspect of Ottawa syntax that indicates the relative discourse prominence of noun phrases containing third persons; {{it does not have}} a direct analogue in English grammar.|$|E
5|$|Like other Ojibwe dialects, Ottawa grammar {{includes}} animate and inanimate noun gender, subclasses of verbs {{that are}} dependent upon gender, combinations of prefixes and suffixes that are connected with particular verb subclasses, and complex patterns of word formation. Ottawa distinguishes {{two types of}} third person in sentences: <b>proximate,</b> indicating a noun phrase that is emphasized in the discourse, and obviative, indicating a noun phrase that is less prominent. Ottawa has relatively flexible word order compared with languages such as English.|$|E
5|$|Most Bay State {{residents}} {{live within}} the Boston Metropolitan Area, also known as Greater Boston, which includes Boston and its <b>proximate</b> surroundings but also extending to Greater Lowell and to Worcester. The Springfield metropolitan area, also known as Greater Springfield, is also a major center of population. Demographically, the center of population of Massachusetts {{is located in the}} town of Natick.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors, {{including}} the bizarre facts and Cardozo's outstanding reputation, {{made the case}} prominent in the legal profession, and it remains so, taught to {{most if not all}} American law students in torts class. Cardozo's conception, that tort liability only occurs when a defendant breaches a duty of care the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely accepted in American law. In dealing with <b>proximate</b> cause, many states have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in Palsgraf, Judge William S. Andrews. Some legal scholars in recent years have criticized Cardozo for not taking into account Palsgraf's impoverished circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Presiding Justice Edward Lazansky (joined by Justice J. Addison Young) wrote a dissent. Lazansky, {{the son of}} Czech immigrants, {{had been}} elected New York Secretary of State as a Democrat in 1910. Elected to the Supreme Court in 1917, he had been {{designated}} presiding justice of the Second Department by Governor Smith earlier in 1927. Lazansky did not question the jury finding of negligence, but felt that the employees' conduct was not the <b>proximate</b> cause of Palsgraf's injuries, since the man's conduct in bringing a package that might explode to a crowded passenger station was an independent act of negligence, rendering the neglect by the railroad too remote in causation {{for there to be}} liability.|$|E
5|$|The <b>proximate</b> {{cause of}} the {{conflict}} was {{the death of a}} Praying Indian named John Sassamon in 1675. Sassamon had been an advisor and friend to King Philip; however, Sassamon's conversion to Christianity had driven the two apart. Accused in the murder of Sassamon were some of Philip's most senior lieutenants. A jury of twelve Englishmen and six Praying Indians found the Native Americans guilty of murder and sentenced them to death. To this day, some debate exists whether King Philip's men actually committed the murder.|$|E
5|$|Thigmonastic movements, {{those that}} occur in {{response}} to touch, are used as a defense in some plants. The leaves of the sensitive plant, Mimosa pudica, close up rapidly in response to direct touch, vibration, or even electrical and thermal stimuli. The <b>proximate</b> cause of this mechanical response is an abrupt change in the turgor pressure in the pulvini {{at the base of}} leaves resulting from osmotic phenomena. This is then spread via both electrical and chemical means through the plant; only a single leaflet need be disturbed.|$|E
5|$|In {{many parts}} of the world {{football}} evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans, local communities, and even nations. R. Kapuscinski says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games. The Côte d'Ivoire national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2006 and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouaké, an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time. By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final <b>proximate</b> cause for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras. The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.|$|E
5|$|The First World War, {{also known}} as the Great War and in the United States as World War I, was a global {{military}} conflict that embroiled most of the world's great powers, assembled in two opposing alliances: the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance. More than 70 million military personnel were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. The main combatants descended into a state of total war, directing their entire scientific and industrial capabilities into the war effort. Over 15 million people were killed, {{making it one of the}} deadliest conflicts in history. The <b>proximate</b> cause of war was the assassination on 28 June 1914 of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. Soon after, a system of alliances were activated that would see Europe at war. The Western Front saw the largest concentration of Commonwealth troops with soldiers occupying sectors of the line from the North Sea to the Orne River.|$|E
5|$|The {{pre-existing}} {{portions of}} the Silver Line, which became the Orange and Blue Lines, opened on July 1, 1977 from Stadium-Armory to Rosslyn, on December 11, 1979 from Rosslyn to Ballston, November 22, 1980 from Stadium-Armory to Addison Road, June 7, 1986 from Ballston-MU through East Falls Church and December 18, 2004 from Addison Road to Largo Town Center. Unlike all prior segments of the Metrorail system, which were designed and constructed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), this line will be designed and constructed by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) and operated by WMATA. The {{first phase of the}} project is funded 43% by $900 million of federal funding, 28% by a special tax district on commercial property <b>proximate</b> to the Silver Line route and 28% by a $0.50 toll increase on the Dulles Toll Road. Funding for {{the second phase of the}} project will be shared by Loudoun County, Fairfax County, the Commonwealth of Virginia and the MWAA.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1870s, {{entrepreneurs}} {{transformed the}} economy from small, craft-organized factories located {{inside the city}} limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, {{the division of labor}} increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by <b>proximate</b> residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.|$|E
25|$|The first {{mentioned}} and/or primary animate {{third person}} is proximate; all other third persons are obviative, unless they act {{in conjunction with}} the <b>proximate</b> participant. Verbs are also inflected to indicate whether the verbal action is <b>proximate</b> on obviate or obviate on <b>proximate.</b>|$|E

25|$|Evolutionary {{principles}} {{have predicted}} that the reward system {{is part of the}} <b>proximate</b> mechanism underlying the behavior. Being that animals have the brain reward system they are motivated to perform in different ways by desire and reinforced by pleasure. Animals establish security of food, shelter, social contact, and mating because <b>proximate</b> mechanism, if they do not seek these necessities they will not survive.|$|E
25|$|Third person {{participants}} are marked for gender (animate versus inanimate), obviation (<b>proximate</b> versus obviative), and presence (nonabsentative versus absentative). Generally, the inanimate, obviative, and absentative categories are more marked than their opposites (i.e. animate, <b>proximate,</b> and nonabsentative), {{however it is}} not clear whether animacy or inanimacy is the more marked of the opposition. The first and second persons are not marked for presence or obviation, and are always animate.|$|E

25|$|Critics of {{evolutionary}} psychology accuse it of promoting genetic determinism, panadaptionism (the idea that all behaviors and anatomical features are adaptations), unfalsifiable hypotheses, distal or ultimate explanations of behavior when <b>proximate</b> explanations are superior, and malevolent political or moral ideas.|$|E
25|$|Another line of {{research}} has focused on the <b>proximate</b> effects of circulating testosterone on the nervous system, as mediated by local metabolism within the brain. Testosterone can be metabolized to 17b-estradiol by the enzyme aromatase, or to 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5a-reductase.|$|E
25|$|Some critics view {{evolutionary}} psychology {{as a form}} of genetic reductionism and genetic determinism, a common critique being that {{evolutionary psychology}} does not address the complexity of individual development and experience and fails to explain the influence of genes on behavior in individual cases. Evolutionary psychologists respond that they are working within a nature-nurture interactionist framework that acknowledges that many psychological adaptations are facultative (sensitive to environmental variations during individual development). The discipline is generally not focused on <b>proximate</b> analyses of behavior, but rather its focus is on the study of distal/ultimate causality (the evolution of psychological adaptations). The field of behavioral genetics is focused on the study of the <b>proximate</b> influence of genes on behavior.|$|E

25|$|In {{approaching}} Ideal's second claim—that National {{had violated}} section 1962(a) by using illegitimate funds to purchase its second store—the Court explained that both section 1962(c) and 1962(a) claims must be asserted under section 1964(c), invoking {{the requirement that}} the plaintiff's injury be proximately caused by the defendant's RICO violation. However, where sections 1962(c) and 1962(a) establish two distinct prohibitions, the Court said it is debatable whether Ideal's 1962(a) claim should be analyzed {{in the same way}} as its 1962(c) claim in regards to <b>proximate</b> cause. The Supreme Court declined, however, to consider the issue because the Second Circuit failed to address <b>proximate</b> causation in relation to Ideal's 1962(a) claim. Thus, the Court vacated and remanded the Second Circuit's judgment with the instructions that the Second Circuit confront this issue.|$|E
25|$|Cuts to the EPA's {{funding and}} {{resources}} would hinder the regulation and remediation of Superfund sites.
