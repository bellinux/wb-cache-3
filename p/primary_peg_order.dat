In the present paper, we examine the possibility to prepare such non-phospholipid liposomes with interfacial polyethylene glycol (<b>PEG)</b> in <b>order</b> to improve their circulation in the blood stream. Cholesterol (Chol) was chosen as the PEG anchor. Experiments The phase behavior of mixtures of palmitic acid (PA) and cholesterol including various proportions of PEGylated cholesterol (PEG-Chol) was characterized. In conditions leading to the formation of fluid bilayers, properties of the resulting liposomes were assessed. Findings Up to 20 mol% of PEGylated cholesterol could be introduced without significant perturbations in fluid bilayers made of PA and cholesterol. With 10 mol% PEG-Chol, PA/Chol/PEG-Chol liposomes showed a very limited permeability to calcein and doxorubicin. Doxorubicin could be actively loaded in PA/Chol/PEG-Chol liposomes with a high drug loading efficiency and a high drug to lipid ratio. Pharmaco-kinetic experiments in rats indicated that interfacial PEG reduced the clearance of PA/Chol liposomes compared to the naked ones. However the lifetime of these non-phospholipid liposomes in the blood circulation was considerably shorter than that observed for control PEGylated phospholipid liposomes, a phenomenon associated with the negative interfacial charge of the PA/Chol/PEG-Chol liposomes. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} the main barrier to an {{integrated}} international interbank market is the existence of asymmetric information between different countries, which may prevail in spite of monetary integration or successful currency <b>pegging.</b> In <b>order</b> to address this issue, we study the scope for international interbank market integration with unsecured lending when cross-country information is noisy. We find not only that an equilibrium with integrated markets need not always exist, but also that when it does, the integrated equilibrium may coexist with one of interbank market segmentation. Therefore, market deregulation, per se, does not guarantee {{the emergence of an}} integrated interbank market. The effect of a repo market which, a priori, was supposed to improve efficiency happens to be more complex: it reduces interest rate spreads and improves upon the segmentation equilibrium, but it may destroy the unsecured integrated equilibrium, since the repo market will attract the best borrowers. The introduction of other transnational institutional arrangements, such as multinational banking, correspondent banking and the existence of "too-big-to-fail" banks may reduce cross country interest spreads and provide more insurance against country wide liquidity shocks.

Silica shells with a tunable thickness were grown in situ, directly around a highly mono-disperse and stable oil-in-water emulsion system, stabilized by a double bio-functional polyelectrolyte heparin/chitosan layer. Such silica showed a complete degradation in a physiological medium (SBF) in a time frame of three days. Moreover, the outer silica shell was coated with polyethyleneglycol (<b>PEG)</b> in <b>order</b> to confer antifouling properties to the final nanocapsule. The outer silica layer combined its properties (it is an optimal bio-interface for bio-conjugations and for the embedding of hydrophilic drugs in the porous structure) with the capability to stabilize the oil core for the confinement of high payloads of lipophilic tracers (e. g. CdSe quantum dots, Nile Red) and drugs. In addition, polymer layers - besides conferring stability to the emulsion while building the silica shell - can be independently exploited if suitably functionalized, as demonstrated by conjugating chitosan with fluorescein isothiocyanate.

The invading hyphae had a characteristic wave-like appearance, this pattern possibly having {{the advantage of}} preventing rupture of hyphae due to host movements. After death of the host 30 - 48 h after infection, tropic hyphae contained numerous lipid droplets often associated with microbodies (peroxisomes) which were characterized {{by the presence of}} catalase and the beta-oxidation enzyme thiolase. Conidiophores developed from tips of trophic hyphae; the process of outgrowth being similar to that for initial penetration in that it occurred via enzymic action and mechanical force.

The nanocomposites also shows enhanced thermal stability compared with PLA/PEG blend in thermogravimetry analysis (TGA).

Surface micro-patterning by spontaneous dewetting of thin polymer films represents a versatile and robust process to fabricate surfaces with controlled topography and chemistry at the micro-scale. In this Thesis, we used polymer dewetting in combination with complementary approaches to engineer both surface chemistry and the ordering of the dewetting patterns. The dewetting of poly(D,L-glycolide-co-lactide) (PLGA) thin films on polystyrene (PS) was combined with the grafting of protein-repellent poly(ethylene glycol) (<b>PEG),</b> in <b>order</b> to form topographical and chemical surface micropatterns consisting in protein-adhesive PS domains surrounded by protein-repellent PEG-grafted PLGA films. The produced micropatterned surfaces were used for site-specific protein adsorption, and represent a promising platform for biological applications, such as proteomics, single-cell studies and tissue engineering. Spatially ordered surface micropatterns were obtained by combining polymer dewetting with microcontact printing and colloidal lithography, respectively. The dewetting of thin PS films was guided within specific regions of the substrate by prestamping of the silicon substrate with self-assembled monolayers of an alkylsilane by microcontact printing. Ordered micropatterns consisting in arrays of holes with tunable size were obtained by exploiting the spontaneous dewetting of poly(4 -vinyl pyridine) (P 4 VP) thin films on PS from the holes produced by colloidal imprinting with two-dimensional colloidal crystals assembled on the polymer bilayer...|$|R
