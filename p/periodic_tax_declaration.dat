In 2008 it was used by almost 26 percent of the Canton of Bern taxpayers (42 % used the TaxMe-CD or other software, and the last third chose the paper forms). The TaxMe portal furthermore gives taxpayer access to their fiscal data (taxation status, amounts paid, etc.) and allows them to send electronic vouchers. TaxMe-Online does not require any preliminary registration as the taxpayers receive their user ID {{at the same time}} as the <b>tax</b> <b>declaration</b> forms, and when they log in with their identification data, their identity data (name, address, etc.) are already available. Users do however have to sign a paper-based validation declaration: until they have done so, their online <b>tax</b> <b>declaration</b> is not considered as finalized. The tax administration does not have the right to access taxpayers' data until the receipt of this validation declaration. TaxMe-Online is built on open source components and solutions; data are coded before being sent electronically (Secure Socket Layer). 33 % of the TaxMe-Online users say they are “very happy” with this way of filling in their <b>tax</b> <b>declaration,</b> but amongst citizens using a similar solution on CD-ROM or the paper-based declaration, only 18 % say they are very happy. This paper tries to find out why the online solution scores much higher than other <b>tax</b> <b>declaration</b> systems.

Moreover, in order to further strengthen active corruption the prosecution of tax evasion during that decade had been severely limited.

These must, apart from the <b>tax</b> <b>declaration</b> costs, comprise the costs of tax planning that individuals are willing to bear to avoid taxes. Crude forms of taxation lower declaration costs and give rise to tax avoidance planning through unequal tax burdens. Tax simplification by means of lowering tax compliance costs must pay attention to both types of costs. Altogether, the potential of a reduction of tax compliance costs is thus lower than hoped for.
