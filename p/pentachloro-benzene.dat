40|$|Abstract—This study {{examined}} the temporal component of pentachlorobenzene lethal body residues among three freshwater invertebrates. Also, using previous fluoranthene data allowed a more detailed examination {{of the role of}} biotransformation in lethal body residues and comparisons of lethal residues across chemical classes. Time-dependent toxicity of fluoranthene and <b>pentachloro-benzene</b> were compared among Hyalella azteca, Chironomus tentans, and Diporeia spp. Lethal body residues required for 50 % mortality (LR 50) were not constant and decreased with exposure time for all species. Fluoranthene was most toxic to C. tentans with LR 50 values of 0. 38 mmol·g 21 at 2 d to 0. 15 mmol·g 21 at 10 d and least toxic to Diporeia spp. with values of 9. 97 mmol·g 2...|$|E
40|$|Organochlorine {{pesticides}} (OCPs) {{are capable}} of persisting in the environment, transporting between phase media and accumulating to high levels, implying that they could pose a risk of causing adverse effects to {{human health and the}} environment. Consequently, most OCPs are designated as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and even as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The objective of this paper was to review the current status of pesticide POPs in Taiwan, including aldrin, chlordane, chlordecone, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, α/β-hexachlorocyclohexanes, lindane, mirex, <b>pentachloro-benzene,</b> and toxaphene. The information about their environmental properties, banned use, carcinogenic toxicity and environmental levels, can be connected with the regulatory infrastructure, which has been established by the joint-venture of the central competent authorities (i. e., Environmental Protection Administration, Department of Health, Council of Agriculture, and Council of Labor Affairs). The significant progress to be reported is that the residual levels of these pesticide-POPs, ranging from trace amounts to a few ppb, have declined notably in recent years...|$|E
