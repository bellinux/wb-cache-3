5|$|Amarillo is {{considered}} the regional economic center for the Texas Panhandle as well as Eastern New Mexico and the Oklahoma Panhandle. The meat packing industry is a major employer in Amarillo; about one-quarter of the United States' beef supply is <b>processed</b> <b>in</b> the area. The city is also the location of headquarters for the Texas Cattle Feeders Association. Petroleum extraction is also a major industry. The helium industry has decreased in significance since the federal government privatized local operations in the late 1990s. Bell Helicopter Textron opened a helicopter assembly plant near the city's international airport in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Following in {{the wake}} of the {{advancing}} Allied armies, Pash and Calvert interviewed Frédéric Joliot-Curie about the activities of German scientists. They spoke to officials at Union Minière du Haut Katanga about uranium shipments to Germany. They tracked down 68 tons of ore in Belgium and 30 tons in France. The interrogation of German prisoners indicated that uranium and thorium were being <b>processed</b> <b>in</b> Oranienburg, 20 miles north of Berlin, so Groves arranged for it to be bombed on 15 March 1945.|$|E
5|$|From the Civil War {{until the}} 1920s and peaking in 1924, more meat was <b>processed</b> <b>in</b> Chicago {{than in any}} other place in the world.

The Yards closed at midnight on Friday, July 30, 1971, after several decades of decline during the {{decentralization}} of the meatpacking industry.

Tallow, an animal by-product, was used to manufacture a simple form of shoe polish at this time. Chicago, Illinois, where 82% of the processed meat consumed in the United States was <b>processed</b> <b>in</b> the stock yards, became a major shoe polish producing area.|$|E

5|$|Jaws allow fish {{to eat a}} {{wide variety}} of food, {{including}} plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, <b>processed</b> <b>in</b> finger-shaped pouches called pyloric caeca, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the liver and pancreas add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.|$|E
5|$|Non-inhibitory {{extracellular}} serpins also {{perform a}} wide array of important roles. Thyroxine-binding globulin and transcortin transport the hormones thyroxine and cortisol, respectively. The non-inhibitory serpin ovalbumin is the most abundant protein in egg white. Its exact function is unknown, but it is thought to be a storage protein for the developing foetus. Heat shock serpin 47 is a chaperone, essential for proper folding of collagen. It acts by stabilising collagen's triple helix whilst it is being <b>processed</b> <b>in</b> the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E

5|$|One {{important}} luxury {{product was}} silk, which was imported and then <b>processed</b> <b>in</b> the Empire. In {{order to protect}} the manufacture of silk products, Justinian granted a monopoly to the imperial factories in 541. In order to bypass the Persian landroute, Justinian established friendly relations with the Abyssinians, whom he wanted to act as trade mediators by transporting Indian silk to the Empire; the Abyssinians, however, were unable to compete with the Persian merchants in India. Then, in the early 550s, two monks succeeded in smuggling eggs of silk worms from Central Asia back to Constantinople, and silk became an indigenous product.|$|E

Every <b>process</b> <b>in</b> soil occurs {{on a smaller scale}} than original model’s domain, so it should be described via adequate parameterization. Overall, soil parameterizations implemented in current numerical weather prediction (NWP) model(s) were prepared almost 40 years ago, when NWP models worked with very poor resolution mesh. Since nowadays NWP works over domains of high resolution, these “old” schemes parameterization must be adequately revised. In this paper preliminary results of changes of parameterization of soil processes will be presented...|$|R

5|$|Freddie Stowers was {{the first}} of only two African American to receive the Medal of Honor for actions in World War I. Stowers had led an assault on German trenches, {{continuing}} to lead and encourage his men even after being twice wounded. Stowers died of his wounds, and was shortly afterwards recommended for the Medal of Honor; however, this recommendation was never <b>processed.</b> <b>In</b> 1990, the Department of the Army conducted a review and the Stowers recommendation was uncovered. An investigation was launched, and based on results of the investigation the award of the Medal of Honor was approved. Stowers' Medal of Honor was presented on April 24, 1991—seventy-three years after he was killed-in-action. Henry Johnson's Medal of Honor was presented on June 2, 2015-eighty five years after he died.|$|E
5|$|Other seeds, such as apple pips and plum stones, have fleshy {{receptacles}} {{and smaller}} fruits like hawthorns have seeds enclosed in edible tissue; animals including mammals and birds eat the fruits and either discard the seeds, or swallow {{them so they}} pass through the gut to be deposited in the animal's droppings {{well away from the}} parent tree. The germination of some seeds is improved when they are <b>processed</b> <b>in</b> this way. Nuts may be gathered by animals such as squirrels that cache any not immediately consumed. Many of these caches are never revisited, the nut-casing softens with rain and frost, and the seed germinates in the spring. Pine cones may similarly be hoarded by red squirrels, and grizzly bears may help to disperse the seed by raiding squirrel caches.|$|E
