In the Potteries towns this led {{to each of the}} townships having varying forms of government. Tunstall was parochially within Wolstanton and manorially part of Tunstall manor; Burslem, although manorially a part of Tunstall manor, parochially was part of Burslem parish. It was through these failing regimes, such as the 1813 lapse of the manorial court of Tunstall, that the long <b>process</b> <b>towards</b> federation began.|$|E

25|$|The recent {{increase}} in support for Catalan independence {{has its roots}} in a Constitutional Court ruling in 2010, which struck down parts of the regional 2006 Statute of Autonomy that granted new powers of self-rule to the region. The ruling came after four years of deliberation concerning a constitutional appeal filed by the conservative People's Party (PP) under Mariano Rajoy—then the country's second-largest party, in opposition to the government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's Spanish Socialist Workers' Party—and was met with anger and street protests in Catalonia. Shortly afterward the PP took power in Spain, and after a massive independence demonstration took place in Barcelona on 11 September 2012—Catalonia's National Day—the Catalan government under Artur Mas called a snap regional election and set out to initiate Catalonia's <b>process</b> <b>towards</b> independence.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of Canadian identity was traditionally dominated by three fundamental themes: first, the often conflicted relations between English Canadians and French Canadians {{stemming from the}} French Canadian imperative for cultural and linguistic survival; secondly, the generally close ties between English Canadians and the British Empire, resulting in a gradual political <b>process</b> <b>towards</b> complete independence from the imperial power; and finally, the close proximity of English-speaking Canadians to the United States. In the 20th century, immigrants from African, Caribbean and Asian nationalities have shaped the Canadian identity, a process that continues today with the ongoing arrival {{of large numbers of}} immigrants from non-British or non-French backgrounds, adding the theme of multiculturalism to the debate. Much of the debate over contemporary Canadian identity is argued in political terms, and defines Canada as a country defined by its government policies, which are thought to reflect deeper cultural values.|$|E

25|$|The Six Dynasties poetic period {{formed an}} {{important}} {{link between the}} folk-ballad (yuefu) style prominent in the poetry of the Han dynasty and the following revival and experimentation with the older forms during the Tang dynasty. Even before the formal end of the Han Dynasty the poetic developments typical of that era had begun to yield to the Jian'an style, just as {{the political power of}} Han yielded more and more to that of the rising power of various regional hegemons, including Cao Cao and the Cao family. The Cao family was both poetically involved in this <b>process</b> <b>towards</b> the end of the Han era and into the beginning of the subsequent Three Kingdoms era, one of which kingdoms was founded by the Cao family as dynasts. The Cao family's new state, which they called Wei, also was the base area of the Sima clan, which increased in power over time, until one of the Sima family became Emperor Wu of Jin. The early phase of this Jin dynasty, known as Western Jin, provided a unified period for China (265–316), but lacking long-term stability. After this period, the Jin ceded control of the north to various successor states. However, the Jin dynasty as a whole was rather productive of poetry, both original works and collections and criticism. The north–south divide continued as a major feature in the landscape of Chinese poetry through the eventual Sui dynasty re-unification, which shortly gave way to the relatively unified and long term stability of the Tang dynasty, and a whole new poetic era of Tang poetry.|$|E
500|$|After World War II, {{the colonies}} of French West Africa began a 15 year <b>process</b> <b>towards</b> independence. French Dahomey, {{like many other}} colonies, saw {{domestic}} political parties emerge in the mid-1950s. However, in contrast {{to many of the}} other colonies, political parties in French Dahomey did not become predominant through the whole colony, but largely adhered to the precolonial regions. In {{the northern part of the}} country, the Groupement Ethnique du Nord and then the Rassemblement Démocratique du Dahomé led by Hubert Maga were the most dominant party. In the area that was formerly the kingdom of Dahomey, the Union Démocratique du Dahomé led by Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin became the most powerful party. And in Porto-Novo, the Parti des Nationialistes Dahoméens led by Sourou-Migan Apithy was the major party. Although there were some efforts by the various parties to become predominant throughout the colony, the division of the colony into three distinct spheres for the different parties had largely solidified by 1957. Apithy was the major political leader in the colony, being elected twice to the French National Assembly in 1946 and 1951. Maga was also elected in 1951 as the colony's second representative to the National Assembly.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{his thought}} <b>process</b> <b>towards</b> the material, Vaughn {{said he was}} {{motivated}} by [...] "unfinished business" [...] with Marvel, having been previously involved with the production of both X-Men: The Last Stand and Thor. Vaughn declared {{that he was more}} enthusiastic about First Class than The Last Stand due to not being constrained by the previous installments, and having the opportunity to [...] "start fresh", while [...] "nodding towards" [...] the successful elements from those films. Vaughn compared First Class to both Batman Begins (2005), which restarted a franchise with an unseen approach, and the 2009 Star Trek film, which paid homage to the original source material while taking it in a new direction with a fresh, young cast. Regarding continuity, Vaughn said his intention was [...] "to make as good a film that could stand on its own two feet regardless of all the other films" [...] and also that could [...] "reboot and start a whole new X-Men franchise". Goldman added the film was kind of an [...] "alternate history" [...] for the X-Men, saying that while rebooting, the writers {{did not want to go}} fully [...] "against the canon of the X-Men trilogy", comparing to the various approaches the comic had in over fifty years of publication.|$|E
