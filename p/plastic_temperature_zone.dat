40|$|Plastic zones around crack-tips in {{tungsten}} were characterised by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Pre-cracks {{were made}} in ~ 1 mm square cross section beams of pure single-crystal tungsten using a spark erosion method. The beams were loaded at different temperatures {{to a range of}} stress intensity factors below the fracture toughness. High resolution EBSD patterns were recorded in a two dimensional array {{in the vicinity of the}} crack-tip on sectioned samples. Cross-correlation based analysis of these patterns was used to determine lattice rotations associated with the plastic deformation near the cracks.

40|$|For thermal {{cabin control}} of {{commercial}} aircraft, the cabin is usually divided {{into a small}} number of <b>temperature</b> <b>zones.</b> Each zone features its own air supply pipe. The necessary installation space for ducting increases significantly with the number of zones. This requires the number of <b>temperature</b> <b>zones</b> to be low. Factors such as seating layout, galley placement and passenger density result in deviations in heat flux throughout the cabin. These deviations cannot be compensated by the control system, if they occur within the same <b>temperature</b> <b>zone.</b> This work presents a novel temperature regulation concept based on local mixing. In this concept, two main ducts span the complete cabin length, and provide moderately warm and cold air. At each <b>temperature</b> <b>zone,</b> cabin supply air is locally mixed using butterfly valves. In this way, the number of <b>temperature</b> <b>zones</b> can be individually scaled up without any additional ducting, only requiring additional valves for each <b>temperature</b> <b>zone.</b> The access to hot trim air {{at the site of the}} mixing chamber can therefore be omitted. The advantages of this concept are bought at the expense of a more complex control system and a more sophisticated management of failure modes. Pneumatic coupling between <b>temperature</b> <b>zones</b> is much more pronounced compared with the traditional architecture. A centralized control architecture is required. A prototype architecture is presented, as well as a corresponding control system candidate. Possible strategies for the handling of failure modes are discussed.

30|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} work on conceptual models and numerical simulations of supercritical geothermal systems. Fournier (1999) developed a comprehensive conceptual {{model of the}} link between magmatic and hydrothermal systems that includes sharp thermal and fluid-pressure gradients across the brittle–ductile transition near the supercritical temperature. According to this model, episodic breaches of the higher <b>temperature</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>zone</b> result in discharge of fluid into the overlying brittle domain, leading to faulting, brecciation, and hydrothermal alteration and vein mineralization. Early work focused on developing simulators that could handle temperatures ranging from those found in hydrothermal systems up to those of magmatic systems (e.g., Hayba and Ingebritsen 1994). Ingebritsen et al. (2010) provide an overview of numerical modeling of magmatic hydrothermal systems, looking at the transfer of heat and metals from magma bodies into the overlying crust through fluid–rock interaction. Yano and Ishido (1998) utilized the STAR general-purpose geothermal reservoir simulator, incorporating the HOTH 2 O equation-of-state package, to model flow to a well from a supercritical reservoir, and noted that complex behavior might be expected due to nonlinear changes in compressibility and fluid viscosity. Norton and Dutrow (2001) concurred, suggesting that magma–hydrothermal processes should be thought of as complex dynamical systems whose behavior near the supercritical region is likely chaotic; this is also consistent with the ideas of Fournier (1991), who suggested that zones of increased permeability might be episodic features associated with elevated strain rates. Watanabe et al. (2000) noted that the high heat capacity of supercritical fluids allows for more effective heat mining from high-temperature rocks.|$|R
