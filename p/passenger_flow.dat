40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a real-time rolling stock rescheduling model for disruption management of passenger railways. Large-scale disruptions, e. g., due to malfunctioning infrastructure or rolling stock, usually {{result in the}} cancellation of train services. As a consequence, the <b>passenger</b> <b>flows</b> change, because <b>passengers</b> will look for alternative routes {{to get to their}} destinations. Our model takes these dynamic <b>passenger</b> <b>flows</b> into account. This is in contrast with most traditional rolling stock rescheduling models that consider the <b>passenger</b> <b>flows</b> either as static or as given input. Furthermore, we describe an iterative heuristic for solving the rolling stock rescheduling model with dynamic <b>passenger</b> <b>flows.</b> The model and the heuristic were tested on realistic problem instances of Netherlands Railways, the major operator of passenger trains in the Netherlands. The computational results show that the average delay of the passengers can be reduced significantly by taking into account the dynamic behavior of the <b>passenger</b> <b>flows</b> on the detour routes, and that the computation times of the iterative heuristic are appropriate for an application in real-time disruption management...|$|R

25|$|By 1909 it was {{determined}} that improvements needed to be made to the fleet. Since the design of the Composites was heavily influenced by both elevated equipment and railroad coaches of the time, the cars featured only two doors at the extreme ends of the subway car.

This required removing the transverse seats which faced each other {{in the center of the}} car. After the modification, passenger seating would be in the longitudinal direction (along the sides of the car) only. This created more room for standees.

Currently, Gate 12, Pier B has been upgraded to accommodate the A380, the only gate at the airport that can handle this aircraft so far.

40|$|An {{approach}} for modeling <b>passenger</b> <b>flows</b> in airport terminals {{by a set}} of devised advanced traits of passengers is proposed. Advanced traits take into account a passenger’s cognitive preferences which would be the underlying motivations of route-choice decisions. Basic traits are the status of passengers such as travel class. Although the activities of passengers are normally regarded as stochastic and sometimes unpredictable, we advise that real scenarios of <b>passenger</b> <b>flows</b> are basically feasible to be compared with virtual simulations in terms of tactical route-choice decision-making by individual personals. Inside airport terminals, passengers are goal-directed and not only use standard processing check points but also behave discretionary activities during the course. In this paper, we integrated discretionary activities in the study to fulfill full-range of <b>passenger</b> <b>flows.</b> In the model passengers are built as intelligent agents who possess a bunch of initial basic traits and then can be categorized into ten distinguish groups in terms of route-choice preferences by inferring the results of advanced traits.

2500|$|Despite these efforts, {{during the}} morning rush hour, {{conductors}} at line terminals and other busy stations must routinely restrict the number of passengers who can board each train to prevent the train from becoming too crowded for passengers waiting at other stations down the line.

40|$|Cities {{separated}} in space are connected together by spatial interaction (SI) between them. But the studies {{focusing on the}} SI are relatively few in China {{mainly because of the}} scarcity of data.

By using a data set consisting of rail O-D (origin-destination) <b>passenger</b> <b>flows</b> among nearly 200 cities, inter-city rail distance O-D matrixes, and some other indices, it is found that the attenuating tendency of rail passenger is obvious. And by the analysis on dominant flows and spatial structure of flows, we find that <b>passenger</b> <b>flows</b> have a trend of polarizing to hubs while the linkages between hubs upgrade. However, the gravity model reveals an overall picture of convergence process over time which is not in our expectation of integration process in the framework of globalization and economic integration. Some driven factors for the re-organization process of the structure of urban agglomeration, such as technique advance, globalization, etc. are discussed further based on the results we obtained...|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the largest}} issues was simply that the Boeing LRV was a [...] "compromise" [...] car.

This became a <b>passenger</b> <b>flow</b> problem since the Muni could only use the two center doors on the LRVs in the subway, as {{the front end of}} the car curved away from the platforms too much to allow passengers to safely board or alight the cars.

2500|$|In 1991, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) held {{a public}} hearing to discuss a bus route between Manhattan and LaGuardia Airport.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{continues}} {{our work}} on perturbation analysis of multimodal transportation networks (TNs) {{by means of}} a stochastic hybrid automaton (SHA) model. We focus here on the approximate computation, in particular on the major bottleneck consisting in the high dimensionality of systems of stochastic differential balance equations (SDEs) that define the continuous passenger-flow dynamics in the different modes of the SHA model. In fact, for every pair of a mode and a station, one system of coupled SDEs relates the passenger loads of all discrete points such as platforms considered in this station, and all vehicles docked to it, to the <b>passenger</b> <b>flows</b> in between. In general, such an SDE system has many dimensions, which makes its numerical computation and thus the approximate computation of the SHA model intractable. We show how these systems can be canonically replaced by lower-dimensional ones, by decoupling the <b>passenger</b> <b>flows</b> inside every mode from one another. We prove that the resulting approximating passenger-flow dynamics converges to the original one, if the replacing set of balance equations set up for all decoupled <b>passenger</b> <b>flows</b> communicate their results among each other in vanishing time intervals...|$|R
