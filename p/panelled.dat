5|$|Some of the cathedral's {{fittings}} {{and monuments}} {{are hundreds of}} years old. The brass lectern in the Lady Chapel dates from 1661 and has a moulded stand and foliate crest. In the north transept chapel is a 17th-century oak screen with columns, formerly used in cow stalls, with artisan Ionic capitals and cornice, set forward over the chest tomb of John Godelee. There is a bound oak chest from the 14th century, which was used to store the chapter seal and key documents. The bishop's throne dates from 1340, and has a <b>panelled,</b> canted front and stone doorway, and a deep nodding cusped ogee canopy above it, with three-stepped statue niches and pinnacles. The throne was restored by Anthony Salvin around 1850. Opposite the throne is a 19th-century octagonal pulpit on a coved base with <b>panelled</b> sides, and steps up from the north aisle. The round font in the south transept is from the former Saxon cathedral and has an arcade of round-headed arches, on a round plinth. The font cover was made in 1635 and is decorated with the heads of putti. The Chapel of St Martin is a memorial to every Somerset man who fell in World War I.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} {{were influenced}} by Inigo Jones, but executed by his heir John Webb, a fact confirmed many years later when the National Trust discovered Webb's plans during their formal takeover of the estate. The interiors mostly date from about 1835. The hall has a barrel-vaulted high ceiling with painted decoration and the dining room has <b>panelled</b> walls, tapestries and a decorated plaster ceiling. The library has a ceiling painting attributed to Guido Reni. The staircase is of white marble with turned balusters and a relief frieze, its ornamented ceiling being attributed to Giorgione.|$|E

40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) <b>panels</b> {{account for}} a {{majority}} of the cost of photovoltaic thermal (PVT) <b>panels.</b> Bifacial silicon solar <b>panels</b> are attractive for PVT <b>panels</b> because of their potential to enhance electrical power generation from the same silicon wafer compared with conventional monofacial solar <b>panels.</b> This paper examines the performance of air-based bifacial PVT <b>panels</b> with regard to the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Four air-based bifacial PVT <b>panels</b> were designed. The maximum efficiencies of 45 % to 63 % were observed for the double-path-parallel bifacial PVT <b>panel</b> based on the first law of thermodynamics. Single-path bifacial PVT <b>panel</b> represents the highest exergy efficiency (10 %). Double-path-parallel bifacial PVT <b>panel</b> is the second preferred design as it generates up to 20 % additional total energy compared with the single-path <b>panel.</b> However, the daily average exergy efficiency of a double-path-parallel <b>panel</b> is 0. 35 % lower than that of a single-path <b>panel...</b>|$|R

5|$|Wain's Hotel, 310 Princes St (Category I). Built in 1879 to {{a design}} by Mason & Wales, Wain's Hotel remains Dunedin's grandest hotel building, and {{reflects}} the opulence which followed the Central Otago Gold Rush of the 1860s. The interior has been substantially remodelled, but the exterior's Italianate Renaissance façade remains largely intact. This latter features much intricate work by mason George Munro, notably the figures found carved within the <b>panelled</b> spandrels {{and supporting the}} façade's oriel windows.|$|E
5|$|A <b>panelled</b> stone {{structure}} in the church, carved with processions of bearded and robed figures under arches, seems to reproduce details found in the Book of Cerne, a work associated with Bishop Æthelwold of Lichfield (818–830). The panels, which may originally have been the outer part of a sarcophagus built to hold {{the remains of a}} high status person such as Saint Hardulph, are dated by their similarity to the illustrations in the Book of Cerne to the first third of the ninth century. According to a medieval calendar of saints, the Benedictine monks at Breedon celebrated Hardulph's feast day on 21 August.|$|E
5|$|East Worldham House, a Grade II listed building, {{dates to}} the late 18th and early 19th century. The two-storey house is made with ashlar walls, flat arches and stone cills. The {{entrance}} {{is located on the}} west side and features a Tuscan porch in the centre, with 5 windows, one of them large. The interior of the house contains Regency features, with a staircase, <b>panelled</b> doors in architraves, and several fireplaces. The coach house, 5 metres {{to the north of the}} house is also a listed building, dated to the early 19th century. It is made of malmstone ashlar, with the upper wall of the centre boarded with a hay loft door and has a hipped slate roof. Today this building functions as a garage and workshop.|$|E

5|$|Passing {{from these}} {{historic}} examples {{we find the}} chair monopolized by the ruler, lay or ecclesiastical, to a comparatively late date. As the seat of authority it stood {{at the head of}} the lord’s table, on his dais, by the side of his bed. The seigneurial chair, more common in France and the Netherlands than in England, is a very interesting type, approximating in many respects to the episcopal or abbatial throne or stall. It early acquired a very high back and sometimes had a canopy. Arms were invariable, and the lower part was closed in with <b>panelled</b> or carved front and sides—the seat, indeed, was often hinged and sometimes closed with a key.|$|E
5|$|The Baroque wooden reredos of 1679, {{probably}} by local man Thomas Sabin, {{has been compared}} favourably {{with the work of}} Christopher Wren and Grinling Gibbons, and the metal screen also made by an Ashby craftsman, John Staley, is also of high quality. There is a Royal Arms from the reign of CharlesII high on the west wall of the nave. The alabaster pulpit and octagonal font were made by Earp in 1878–1880. The font is carved from a single block of stone and decorated on each face with Christian symbols, and rests on red granite pillars on a Portland stone base. The pulpit is similarly supported to match the font. A second, smaller font with a <b>panelled</b> stem is in the southwestern corner of the nave.|$|E

5|$|The {{church is}} entered through the porch {{to the west}} end of the south wall of the nave, which leads to an arched doorway. There are two 18th-century slate plaques on the walls by the south door commemorating those who made {{donations}} to the poor of the parish; one has names from 1761, the other from 1766. On the opposite wall, a 17th-century slate plaque commemorates Hugh ap Richard Lewis and his wife Jane (died 1660 and 1661 respectively). The internal timbers of the roof, some of which are old, are exposed, but there is a decorated <b>panelled</b> barrel-vaulted ceiling above the sanctuary at the east end of the church. The transept roof is largely 17th-century.|$|E
5|$|The Blagrave {{family were}} wealthy landowners around Reading, and the manor passed {{down through the}} family (which {{included}} mathematician John Blagrave, who built a new house at Southcote); a lease document dated from 1596 suggests that the manor was divided between three Blagrave brothers. Daniel Blagrave, a cousin of John, inherited the manor on the latter's death in 1611. At {{the time of the}} English Civil War, during the Siege of Reading in 1643, the Blagraves allowed Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex to use the manor as his headquarters. The Blagrave family, who were sympathetic to the Roundheads, are said to have hosted Oliver Cromwell, John Hampden and Robert Blake for a council of war in one of the house's oak <b>panelled</b> rooms. In January 1649, Daniel was one of the signatories of Charles I's death warrant.|$|E
5|$|The porch {{leads into}} the great hall which has a Minton tile floor and a large stone chimney piece.

5|$|The school {{continued}} to use the former guildhall site in Hill Street until 1898, by which stage the medieval building was much altered and in a dilapidated condition. At this point, the school moved to an 18th-century house on South Brink. A fundraising campaign was launched {{to pay for the}} house, but after insufficient funds were donated, the cost of purchase was met by Alexander, Baron Peckover. The house and its grounds was originally intended to be the headmaster's residence and provide lodgings for a few boarders, but soon expanded to accommodate the entire school with the construction of classrooms and a hall. The central block of the 18th-century town house was used as a <b>panelled</b> library. An unusual feature of the old town house is the cupola on the roof, evidence of the town's sea-based prosperity.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of the {{entrance}} lies the dining room, which was formerly the Jacobean great hall. The room least damaged by the fire, it was restored by Barry to its 17th century appearance, with facsimiles of the original ceiling and carved wooden screen. It contains an overmantel featuring a relief of Plenty, considered to be original, and a large stone chimneypiece, which {{is believed to be the}} only surviving work by Blore on the interior. The oak parlour, in the south west, contains a large wooden Jacobean overmantel, featuring Green Men carving. The Jacobean carving here and in the dining room is noticeably cruder than the Victorian work. The carved parlour is another reproduction by Barry of the original. <b>Panelled</b> in oak, it has a plaster frieze of the Elements, Graces and Virtues. The alabaster chimneypiece depicts the winged figure of Time rewarding Industry and punishing Sloth, symbolised by two boys, which is surmounted by a carved portrait of Sir Randolph Crewe.|$|E
5|$|Leicester's {{gatehouse}} {{was built}} {{on the north side of}} the base court, replacing an older gatehouse to provide a fashionable entrance from the direction of Coventry. The external design, with its symbolic towers and, originally, battlements, echoes a style popular a century or more before, closely resembling Kirby Muxloe and the Beauchamp gatehouse at Warwick Castle. By contrast the interior, with its contemporary wood panelling, is in the same, highly contemporary Elizabethan fashion of Leicester's building in the inner court. Leicester's gatehouse is one of the few parts of the castle to remain intact. The stables built by John Dudley in the 1550s also survive and lie along the east side of the base court. The stable block is a large building built mostly in stone, but with a timber-framed, decoratively <b>panelled</b> first storey designed in an anachronistic, vernacular style. Both buildings could have easily been seen from Leicester's building and were therefore on permanent display to visitors. Leciester's intent may have been to create a deliberately anachronistic view across the base court, echoing the older ideals of chivalry and romance alongside the more modern aspects of the redesign of the castle.|$|E
