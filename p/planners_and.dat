5|$|Environmentalists, urban <b>planners</b> <b>and</b> cycling enthusiasts {{around the}} world have {{expressed}} interest in the Cycle Center, and want to emulate {{what they see as a}} success story in urban planning and transit-oriented development. Pro-cycling and environmentalist journalists in publications well beyond the Chicago metropolitan area have described the Cycle Center as exemplary, impressive, unique and ground-breaking.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} these changes had little practical effect, possibly due to opposition by the <b>planners</b> <b>and</b> confusion or fear among cadres. From 1981–84 agricultural production grew substantially, {{but the government}} did not use this opportunity to increase production of such crucial farm inputs as fertilizer, pesticide and fuel, nor of consumer goods. By the end of Lê Duẩn's rule, in 1985–1986, inflation had reached over 100% annually, complicating economic policy-making.|$|E
5|$|Further {{disagreements}} existed {{about the}} design and character of the new building. Facsimile reconstruction, while feasible, was not seriously contemplated. There was a general agreement that the new building should also have a cultural as well as commercial purpose. While the Jewish Community of Zagreb envisioned a modern design reminiscent of the original synagogue, the Bet Israel advocated building {{a replica of the}} original synagogue's facade, perceiving it as having a powerful symbolism. Opinions of architects, urban <b>planners,</b> <b>and</b> art historians were also divided along similar lines.|$|E

5|$|In September 1950, on Collins' {{orders the}} Ranger Training Center {{was moved to}} Fort Benning, Georgia, and in October the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Ranger Companies began training. The {{effective}} employment of the Eighth Army Ranger Company had demonstrated {{the viability of the}} concept to Army <b>planners,</b> <b>and</b> the subsequent Chinese attacks in November reinforced the need for more such units. As a result, the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th Ranger Companies were ordered to form. Altogether, another fifteen Ranger companies would be formed in 1950 and 1951, and six of them would see combat in Korea.|$|E
5|$|The attacks caught UN <b>planners</b> <b>and</b> troops by surprise. By August 26, the UN troops {{believed}} they had destroyed the last serious threats to the perimeter, and anticipated the war ending by late November. ROK units, in the meantime, suffered from low morale thanks to their failures to defend effectively thus far in the conflict. UN troops were looking ahead to Operation Chromite, their amphibious assault far behind North Korean lines {{at the port of}} Inchon on September 15, and did not anticipate the North Koreans would mount a serious offensive before then.|$|E

5|$|Vestgrensa {{had served}} the area now served by Forskingsparken since {{the opening of}} the Sognsvann Line on 10 October 1934. In 1991, the Norwegian Parliament decided to build a new {{facility}} for Rikshospitalet at Gaustad, and to serve the hospital by an extension of the Ullevål Hageby Line. Gaustad Station on the Holmenkoll Line of the rapid transit is located within a few hundred meters of the hospital. Vestgrensa was deemed too far away by <b>planners,</b> <b>and</b> a transfer station would need to be established between the light rail and the Sognsvann Line. At first, Blindern was considered, but instead it was later decided that there should be an all-new station.|$|E
5|$|In 1915–1916, the German navy had {{developed}} Bruges {{from a small}} Flanders port into a major naval centre with large concrete bunkers to shelter U-boats, extensive barracks and training facilities for U-boat crews, and similar facilities for other classes of raiding warship. Bruges was therefore a vital asset in the German navy's increasingly desperate struggle to prevent Britain from receiving food and matériel {{from the rest of}} the world. The significance of Bruges was not lost on British naval <b>planners</b> <b>and</b> two previous attempts to close the exit at Ostend, the smaller and narrower of the Bruges canals, had ended in failure. On 7 September 1915, four Lord Clive-class monitors of the Dover Patrol had bombarded the dockyard, while German coastal artillery returned fire. Only 14 rounds were fired by the British with the result that only part of the dockyard was set on fire. In a bombardment on 22 September 1917, the lock gates were hit causing the basin to drain at low water.|$|E
