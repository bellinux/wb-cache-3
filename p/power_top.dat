The DH.5 was unusual in design {{with the top}} wing having a 'back stagger', behind the lower wing, to give the pilot good visibility, {{especially}} overhead. Given its lack of <b>power</b> (<b>top</b> speed was 102 miles per hour) and poor performance at higher altitudes, it was used more for ground attack than air combat. Nevertheless, it was while flying the DH.5 that Woollett destroyed three more German aircraft and drove another down 'out of control'. On 17 August 1917, he became an ace. He was posted back to England as a flight instructor at Eastbourne in August 1917.
