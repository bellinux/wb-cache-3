In this study two possible techniques {{to stabilize the}} polymer were compared, i. e. blending of UV-absorbers (UVAs) into the polymer or using block copolymers based on resorcinol polyarylates. Combination of different analysis techniques shows that the protection by UVAs {{is not as good}} as by the resorcinol <b>polyarylate</b> block copolymers. The block copolymer rearranges itself through a photo-Fries rearrangement within hours into a UV-absorbing top layer.

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} Surrogate (semi-empirical) model for {{prediction}} of cellular {{response to the}} surfaces of biodegradable polymers that have been designed for tissue engineering applications. The predictions of our model, when tested against experimental results, show {{a high degree of}} accuracy that is sufficient for rational design of polymeric materials for biomedical applications. The model was determined by fitting experimental data for a series of 62 <b>polyarylates</b> to a small number of polymer structure-based ‘molecular descriptors’ using the technique of partial least squares (PLS) regression. While PLS is commonly applied in quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analysis employed in the pharmaceutical industry, this study marks the first time the technique has been extended to the problem of biomaterials discovery/design. Quantitative predictions of cellular response to six polymers (untested prior to model building) concurred with experiment within 15. 8 % on average. This performance compares quite favorably with the overall variation in experimental values for the library of <b>polyarylates.</b> Examination of the PLS ‘loadings’ reveals those structure-based features most associated with variations in the polymer performance properties, thereby providing direct guidance to the synthetic chemist in biomaterials design...|$|R

All three polymer types exhibited enhanced solubility, thermal stability, and low dielectric constants that are predicted for polymers containing the HFIP moiety. The moderate thermal stability observed in the polymers derived from the 18 F-diacid is attributed to the oxidatively weak methylene linkage between the HFIP groups and the phenyl rings.

40|$|Hyperbranched {{polymers}} are polymers {{with highly}} branched, yet non-crosslinked structures. In this work, the existing laboratory polymerization procedure was scaled up by a suspension method to synthesize hyperbranched poly(5 -acetoxy isophthalic acid) of high molecular weight. A method of modifying the residual acyl groups of this polymer with different reagents was also established. Especially, {{the synthesis of}} monofunctional etherimide facilitated the compatiblization of the hyperbranched <b>polyarylate</b> with commercial polyetherimide. All modified polymers were characterized by FTIR, 1 H and 13 C NMR, elemental analysis and DSC. Through this modification route, hyperbranched polymers with glass transition temperatures ranging from - 50 ∘C to 188 ∘C were prepared. Using fractionation techniques, samples with different molecular weights were obtained. ^ The structural profiles of hyperbranched <b>polyarylate</b> were then investigated. The measurement {{of the degree of}} branching indicated that these macromolecules had uniform chemical structures. Solution static light scattering revealed that the hyperbranch polyarylates had very compact structures, the dimension of which remained stable regardless of different polymer-solvent interactions. Light scattering, NMR with LSR (Lanthanide Shift Reagent) as well as molecular simulation showed that molecules such as LSR (d∼ 10 A) and solvent could penetrate most part of the structure. Thus, these molecules should be treated as hard porous particles with small pore sizes. ^ n'-Butyl hyperbranched <b>polyarylate</b> and its linear analog poly(1, 4 -butylene isophthalate) were employed to investigate the effect of hyperbranching topology on blend properties. Under all experimental conditions, including a wide range of annealing temperature, molecular weight and blend composition, the blends were found always immiscible by the observation of glass transitions using DSC. Entropically, the compact nature of the hyperbranched polymer prevented itself from mixing with its linear analog at segmental scale. However, TEM revealed that the domain size of the phase separation was around 400 to 600 A, indicating good compatibility. A modified Flory-Huggins theory was introduced to explain the immiscibility. ^ The rheological properties of hyperbranched polymer and its blends presented the most promising aspect for future applications. The relaxation spectrum of hyperbranched <b>polyarylate</b> did not exhibit a plateau zone that is an indication of chain entanglement for linear polymers. This observation was true even for samples with molecular weight over 105. Zero shear viscosity of hyperbranched <b>polyarylate</b> was generally one magnitude lower than that of its linear analog with comparable molecular weight. Furthermore, the viscosities of their blends showed negative deviations from the so-called 2 ̆ 2 log-additivity rule 2 ̆ 2. This finding showed a true opportunity for hyperbranched Folymers to be used as rheology modifiers. ^ Finally, the mechanical property of blends of etherimide modified hyperbranched <b>polyarylate</b> and polyetherimide was investigated. While the tensile modulus of the material was enhanced, the toughness was drastically reduced {{due to the lack of}} entanglement between the macromolecules. Possible methods for improving this drawback were proposed. ...|$|E

40|$|Two {{different}} types of polymers were synthesized and their degradation and combustion behavior were investigated. The first class, 1, 1 -dichloro- 2, 2 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) ethylidene (bisphenol C) based polymers, {{were found to be}} among the most fire-resistant polymers with peak heat release capacities as low as 20 J/g-K. Polymers containing bisphenol C all exhibited exothermic decomposition behavior. When compared to corresponding bisphenol-A-based polymers, these bisphenol-C-containing polymers had higher char yields and lower decomposition temperatures. The presence of bisphenol C in materials, whether as a co-monomer or blends, showed a char enhancement effect; yielding higher char than what is expected by a purely additive affect. ^ Bisphenol C <b>polyarylates</b> and polycarbonates yielded large amounts of HCl and carbon dioxide upon decomposition. Compared with other bisphenol-based polymers, polycarbonates and <b>polyarylates</b> containing bisphenol C yielded significantly less amounts of monomer. Decreasing the concentration of bisphenol C in the copolymers or blends yielded relatively more monomer in the degradation products. ^ The second class of polymers studied were polycarbodiimides, which generally decompose in an endothermic manner to yield quantitative amounts of monomer. The incorporation of TEMPO-containing side chain substituents altered the degradation. TEMPO-based polycarbodiimides decomposed in an exothermic fashion and yielded several other degradation products in addition to the original monomer. These free radical containing polymers showed a 25 % reduction in the peak heat release capacity when compared with the control polymer. Neither polymer was found to be fire resistant which is due to their high organic content and essentially 100 % weight loss during decomposition. ...|$|R

In this effort, isolated and combined effects of hygrothermal exposure and curva-ture-induced kink bands on tensile strength of VectranTM HT (<b>polyarylate</b> liquid crystal polyester fiber) and Kevlar KM 2 are studied. Hygrothermal conditioning was conducted at temperatures ranging from 40 C to 100 C in water for 30 days. Curvature-induced defects were created by wrapping tows around stainless steel rods of different diameters (0. 25 mm to 5 mm) to create kink bands. Combined effects were evaluated by conditioning tows with kink bands at 100 C for 30 days. All conditioned samples were dried and tested at room temperature. Hygrothermal aging showed that tensile properties for Vectran fibers were not appreciably affected below 100 C (12 % reduction), while KM 2 fibers dropped continuously with increasing temperatures (48 % at 100 C). The influence of curvature on kink band density was established for each fiber type. The isolated effect of kink band density on residual strength was approximately 15 % for both Vectran 1670 / 600 and KM 2 - 600. Combined effects of curvature-induced kink bands followed by hygrothermal exposure showed significant reductions in tenacity up to 96 % for KM 2 and 60 % for Vectran HT 1670 / 600.

After heating of equimolar PPVL/PC blends in a TSE for 15 min, a PPVL-PC block copolymer could be isolated containing 25 mol-% pivalolactone (PVL) units.

Thermal decomposition was investigated using spectroscopic methods (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, and attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy) and microscopic methods (scanning force microscopy).

For example, annealing at 120 °C for up to 3 min leads to formation of palladium clusters with absorption maxima at 280, 380, and 420 nm, while a thermal treatment for 10 min or longer favors the growth of metallic palladium particles with an average diameter of 22 nm.

This blend system exhibits a single composition-dependent glass transition temperature over the entire composition range. The equilib-rium melting point depression of PBTwas observed, and Flory interaction parameter c 120. 96 was obtained. These indicate that the blends are thermodynamically miscible in the melt. The crystallization rate of PBT decreased {{as the amount of}} PAr(I 27 -T 73) increased, and a contrary trend was found when PAr(I 27 -T 73) crystallized with the increase of the amount of PBT. The addition of high-Tg PAr(I 27 -T 73) would suppress the segmental mobility of PBT, while low-Tg PBT would have promotional effect on PAr(I 27 -T 73). The crystallization rate and melting point of PBT were significantly influenced when the PAr(I 27 -T 73) crystallites are previously formed. It is because not only does the amorphous phase composition shift to a richer PBT content after the crystallization of PAr(I 27 -T 73), but also the PAr(I 27 -T 73) crystal phase would constrain the crystallization of PBT.

Poly(aryletherketone) s were prepared from BP-F and various ratios of BPC and bisphenol-A (BPA), and their thermal properties were characterized by TGA and PCFC. ^ Fire-resistant bisphenol C and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polyurethanes were prepared through the polycondensation of 1, 1 -dichloro- 2, 2 -bis(4 -isocyanatophenyl) -ethene (BPC-NCO) with BPC and 2000 g/mol hydroxybutyl-terminated PDMS (PDMS-BuOH). These polyurethanes showed increased char yields based on inclusion of BPC-NCO and PDMS-BuOH, and substantially reduced heat release capacities compared to similar polyurethanes prepared with 2, 4 -tolylene diisocyanate and poly(tetramethyleneoxide). ^ Halogen-free, fire-resistant copolyarylates were prepared by interfacial copolymerization of isophthaloyl chloride and several relative ratios of 4, 4 ′-bishydroxydeoxybenzoin and bisphenol A. The fire-resistance of these polyarylates was explored by TGA and PCFC, and char yields of nearly 40 % were observed, twice that of bisphenol A <b>polyarylate.</b> Heat release capacities as low as 81 J/g·K were measured by PCFC. Thus, halogenation, often used to effect fire-resistance in materials, is eliminated all together. ^ Hyperbranched polyphenylenes with bromine and boronic acid termination were prepared by Suzuki coupling polymerization. An exceptionally low heat release capacity of 6 J/g·K were measured by PCFC for bromine terminated polymers and char yields were shown to increase as a function of boronic acid termination due to the formation of a glassy network. ...|$|E
