40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} {{the issue of}} non-physical slip at wall of lattice Boltzmann simulations with the bounce-back boundary scheme. By comparing the analytical solution of two lattice models with four and nine discrete velocities for the force-driven Poiseuille flow, {{we are able to}} reveal the exact mechanism causing the issue. In fact, no boundary condition is defined by the bounce-back scheme for the the discrete velocities parallel to wall. Other factors, such as initial conditions and inlet and outlet boundary conditions, can play the role and induce the non-physical slip velocity. Therefore, the issue is not related to the single-relaxation-time scheme. Naturally the key <b>for</b> <b>resolving</b> <b>it</b> is to specify the definition for these velocities.

40|$|AbstractVisual {{search for}} a unique {{stimulus}} is often faster when the feature defining this target is repeated. Recent research has related this feature priming to ambiguity: priming effects appear stronger when the search target is perceptually ambiguous, as when the search array contains a salient distractor. Here we link the ambiguity that underlies feature priming to ambiguity in neural representation caused by the receptive field organization of visual cortex. We show that as the magnitude of neural activity involved in resolving perceptual ambiguity in early stages of visual cortex increases–indexed in posterior aspects of the N 2 pc component of the visual-event related potential–so does the behavioral feature priming effect. When ambiguity resolution mechanisms act strongly and the target repeats, target processing is facilitated. When these mechanisms act strongly, but the features that have previously defined the target come to characterize the distractor, attention is captured to the distractor location. These results suggest that ambiguity and the attentional mechanisms responsible <b>for</b> <b>resolving</b> <b>it</b> play central roles in feature priming...|$|R

40|$|The central {{projections}} of the olfactory bulb were studied in Polypterus using the Nauta and Fink-Heimer techniques. Two major target areas were identified in the subpallium: the lateral subpallial nucleus and the dorsal and ventral entopeduncular nuclei. The connections are predominantly, if not exclusively, ipsilateral. In the pallium a massive ipsilateral projection to the superficial third of the medial pallium was demonstrated while {{the remainder of the}} pallium was found to be free of degeneration. Thus it appears that the pallium of Polypterus is not uniform throughout, as has been suggested in the literature. This contention is also supported by an analysis of the pallial cytoarchitecture. Because the pallium of Polypterus is everted, rather than inverted and evaginated, the topographically medial pallium is in topological correspondence with the lateral pallium of tetrapods. On the basis of this topological correspondence and the similarity of afference from the olfactory bulb, it is argued that the “medial” pallium of Polypterus is homologous to the pyriform pallium of tetrapods. The findings of this study are compared to those of similar studies in teleosts, which also have an everted pallium.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{conflict}} transformation {{has been an}} outcome of decades of conflict resolution theory and practice for conflict prevention. Preventive approaches towards conflict are people and solution-orientated, peace and truth-focused unlike the “old paradigm ” where violence / war, propaganda, victory and elites are at {{the crux of the}} matter. A recent trend in the conflict resolution field has been increased attention to "transfor-mational " conflict resolution approaches, which promise better results in preventing enduring rivalries and protracted conflicts than approaches based on positional negotiating. That means moving beyond symptomatic treatment of the issues to analyzing and considering the underlying root causes and patterns of relations that drive the conflicts so that change is also transformational. Visionary public leadership of complex conflicts also aim at such change that touches on deep assumptions, values, beliefs and biases. While the literature about conflict resolution emphasizes broad and generic sources of conflict at different levels of analysis and mainly “grand ” theories, an exploration of the sources of conflict and creative alternatives <b>for</b> <b>resolving</b> <b>it</b> at each level separately is required for improving social relations at different levels of interaction, i. e., interpersonal, inter-group, and international in practice.

40|$|The {{end of the}} Soviet Empire {{has brought}} out the {{importance}} of the nationalities problem and the contradictory results produced by the various formulas applied since 1922 <b>for</b> <b>resolving</b> <b>it.</b> Two characteristics conditioned the evolution of this problem in the Soviet Union: the choice of a territorial model which would give a important role to the Empire’s non-Russian peoples; and the contradiction between the theoretical base established by Lenin and Stalin for solving the problem and actual practice, which followed traditional channels. The result was a new territorial structure endowed with the external elements characteristic of a state but cancelled out by the superiority of a party and by a policy ofprotecting minorities deliberately designed to make the new national entities nonviable. The lack of an adequately institutionalized state was at the root, of the virtual disappearance, {{after the collapse of the}} Communist Party, of links between the center and the periphery, a situation that nationalism, where it existed, exploited to gain powerand that governing minorities, meaningless outside the framework created by the USSR, exploited to stay in power. The result was none other than the appearance of new ethnically heterogeneous states with imprecise borders, bereft of the systems of interethnic equilibriumthe Soviet administration had created, and willing to consolidate their independence and identity at the expense of minorities such as the Russians, which have been discriminated against at times and excluded from political and cultural life at others.
