Phase 1 participants {{are referred to as}} volunteers, but in the US are paid $200–$400 per day, and because studies can last several weeks and subjects may volunteer several times a year, earning potential becomes the main reason for participation. Participants are usually taken from the poorest groups in society, and outsourcing increasingly means that trials may be conducted in countries with highly competitive wages by contract research organizations (CROs). The rate of growth for clinical trials in India is 20 <b>percent</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> in Argentina 27 percent, and in China 47 percent, while trials in the UK have fallen by 10 <b>percent</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> and in the US by six percent.|$|E
25|$|Another {{feature of}} the 1974–80 period was an {{acceleration}} of inflation. Between 1968 and 1974, {{the rate of inflation}} had declined steadily, but afterward the trend was reversed. From 16.2 <b>percent</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> in 1973, the growth rate of the general price index increased to 110.2 <b>percent</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> by 1980.|$|E

This acceleration in growth seems even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth {{from a high of}} 4.7 percent in the 1960s to 2.2 percent in the 1990s. Also, the non-globalizing developing countries seem to fare worse than the globalizers, with the former's annual growth rates falling from highs of 3.3 percent during the 1970s to only 1.4 percent during the 1990s. This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s—18 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial.|$|E

25|$|The pragmatic {{modernization}} drive led by {{party leaders}} Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping and China's growing contacts with Western nations {{resulted in a}} sharp acceleration of trade in the early 1970s. Imports of modern plants and equipment were particularly emphasized, and after 1973 oil became an increasingly important export. Trade more than doubled between 1970 and 1975, reaching US$13.9 billion. Growth in this period was about 9 <b>percent</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> As a proportion of GNP, trade grew from 1.7 percent in 1970 to 3.9 percent in 1975. In 1976 the atmosphere of uncertainty resulting from the death of Mao Zedong and pressure from the Gang of Four, whose members opposed reliance on foreign technology, brought another decline in trade.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, {{the company}} became a holding company when it spun off its various {{businesses}} into autonomous companies, {{one of them}} being Fiat Auto. That same year, sales reached an all-time high in the US, corresponding to the Iranian Oil Crisis. However, when gas prices fell again after 1981, Americans began purchasing sport utility vehicles, minivans, and pickup trucks in larger numbers (marking a departure from their past preference for large cars). Also, Japanese automakers had been taking an ever-larger share of the car market, increasing at {{more than half a}} <b>percent</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Consequently, in 1984, Fiat and Lancia withdrew from the United States market.

25|$|As {{political}} stability was gradually restored following the Cultural Revolution {{of the late}} 1960s, a renewed drive for coordinated, balanced development was set in motion {{under the leadership of}} Premier Zhou Enlai. To revive efficiency in industry, Communist Party of China committees were returned to positions of leadership over the revolutionary committees, and a campaign was carried out to return skilled and highly educated personnel to the jobs from which they had been displaced during the Cultural Revolution. Universities began to reopen, and foreign contacts were expanded. Once again the economy suffered from imbalances in the capacities of different industrial sectors and an urgent need for increased supplies of modern inputs for agriculture. In response to these problems, there was a significant increase in investment, including the signing of contracts with foreign firms for the construction of major facilities for chemical fertilizer production, steel finishing, and oil extraction and refining. The most notable of these contracts was for thirteen of the world's largest and most modern chemical fertilizer plants. During this period, industrial output grew at an average rate of 8 <b>percent</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
25|$|As one {{contemporary}} points out, {{there were}} economic benefits with the internment of Japanese Canadians. Specifically, white fishermen directly benefited {{due to the}} impounding of all Japanese-Canadian owned fishing boats. Fishing for salmon was a hotly contested issue between the white Canadians and Japanese Canadians. In 1919, Japanese Canadians received four thousand and six hundred of the salmon-gill net licences, representing roughly half {{of all of the}} licences the government had to distribute. In a very public move on behalf of the Department of Fisheries in British Columbia, it was recommended that in the future Japanese Canadians should never again receive more fishing licences than they had in 1919 and also that every year thereafter that number be reduced. These were measures taken on behalf of the provincial government to oust the Japanese from salmon fishing. The federal government also got involved in 1926, when the House of Commons’ Standing Committee on Fisheries put forward suggestions that the number of fishing licences issued to Japanese Canadians be reduced by ten <b>percent</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> until they were entirely removed from the industry by 1937. The fact that any Japanese Canadians were still fishing in British Columbia at the outset of World War II is amazing due to the pressure they faced from the province, country, and other fishermen. Yet the reason the government gave for impounding the few remaining and operating Japanese-Canadian fishing boats was that the government feared these boats would be used by Japan to mount a horrific coastal attack on British Columbia.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Barry Bonds {{established}} the current record of 73 {{home runs in}} a single season. There had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled {{in large part by}} the abuse of illegal steroids (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion), but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing drugs before 2004. In 2007, Bonds became MLB's all-time home run leader, surpassing Hank Aaron, as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs. Even though McGwire, Sosa, and Bonds—as well as many other players, including storied pitcher Roger Clemens—have been implicated in the steroid abuse scandal, their feats and those of other sluggers had become the major leagues' defining attraction. In contrast to the professional game's resurgence in popularity after the 1994 interruption, Little League enrollment was in decline: after peaking in 1996, it dropped 1 <b>percent</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> over the following decade. With more rigorous testing and penalties for performance-enhancing drug use a possible factor, the balance between bat and ball swung markedly in 2010, which became known as the [...] "Year of the Pitcher".

The Carter administration had imposed wage and price controls which sought to hold collective bargaining wage and benefit increases to 7.5 <b>percent</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> but Fitzsimmons sought 10 <b>percent</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Four days into the labor dispute, layoffs in the automobile manufacturing industry reached 100,000, putting significant pressure on Fitzsimmons to lower his contract demands.

Trends by wealth quintile and urban or rural residence were fitted with multilevel modelling.
