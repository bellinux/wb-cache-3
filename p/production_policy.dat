2500|$|The {{new design}} was {{considerably}} larger, carrying {{three times the}} initial fuel load and designed around larger, more powerful Pratt & Whitney J57 turbojets. The greater dimensions of the J57 engines required modifications to the engine bays, and modification to the intakes to allow a larger amount of airflow to the engine. The new intakes were also designed to be more efficient at higher Mach numbers. In order to increase aerodynamic efficiency, reduce structural weight and alleviate pitch-up phenomena recently identified in flight testing of the Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket, an aircraft with a control surface configuration similar to the XF-88, the horizontal tail was relocated {{to the top of}} the vertical stabilizer, giving the F-101 its signature [...] "T-tail". In late 1952, the mission of the F-101 was changed from [...] "penetration fighter" [...] to [...] "strategic fighter", which entailed equal emphasis on both the bomber escort mission and on nuclear weapons delivery. The new Voodoo mock-up with the reconfigured inlets, tail surfaces, landing gear, and dummy nuclear weapon was inspected by Air Force officials in March 1953. The design was approved, and an initial order for 29 F-101As was placed on 28 May 1953, no prototypes being required as the F-101 was considered a simple development of the XF-88, with the Cook-Cragie <b>production</b> <b>policy,</b> in which initial low-rate production would be used for testing without the use of separate prototypes, chosen instead.|$|E

The arrival of sound pictures posed a serious difficulty for Albatros which had hitherto relied considerably upon Russian actors, especially Mosjoukine whose accent precluded a successful transition into the talking era.|$|E

50|$|Despite Laemmle's {{role as an}} innovator, he was an {{extremely}} cautious studio chief. Unlike rivals Adolph Zukor, William Fox, and Marcus Loew, Laemmle chose not to develop a theater chain. He also financed all of his own films, refusing to take on debt. This policy nearly bankrupted the studio when actor-director Erich von Stroheim insisted on excessively lavish production values for his films Blind Husbands (1919) and Foolish Wives (1922), but Universal shrewdly gained a return {{on some of the}} expenditure by launching a sensational ad campaign that attracted moviegoers. Character actor Lon Chaney became a drawing card for Universal in the 1920s, appearing steadily in dramas. His two biggest hits for Universal were The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) and The Phantom of the Opera (1925). During this period Laemmle entrusted most of the <b>production</b> <b>policy</b> decisions to Irving Thalberg. Thalberg had been Laemmle's personal secretary, and Laemmle was impressed by his cogent observations of how efficiently the studio could be operated. Promoted to studio chief, Thalberg was giving Universal's product a touch of class, but MGM's head of production Louis B. Mayer lured Thalberg away from Universal with a promise of better pay. Without his guidance Universal became a second-tier studio, and would remain so for several decades.|$|E

40|$|The main stated {{objective}} of government land {{policy has been}} to support closer settlement of farmland. Closer settlement has been justified {{in terms of economic}} and social benefits, and in general, has had a considerable impact on the evolving structure of agriculture in the past. However, since 1956 the impact of land policy, has declined as direct intervention gave way to a policing role which attempts to prevent undue aggregation of land. Observations of both land policies and changes in the structure of agriculture show that the former tend to follow changes in the latter rather than produce them. Also, land policies have facilitated changes in production by meeting some of the costs involved. Recent land policies have not been compatible with <b>production</b> <b>policies.</b> Closer settlement could not be pursued while farms rapidly increased in size to 1971. The present trend to smallholding suggests that <b>production</b> <b>policies</b> and closer settlement policies could be made compatible if it were found that viable closer settlement could be linked to the trend to intensified production on smaller farms...|$|R
