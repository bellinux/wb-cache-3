5000|$|Effective <b>press</b> <b>breaks</b> employ quick passing {{more often}} than {{dribbling}} to advance the ball up the floor. Short, quick passes are less prone to turnovers than either long passes or dribbling. Another effective way to <b>break</b> a man-to-man <b>press</b> is to pass to the center. Most presses keep a [...] "last man back" [...] (usually the center) {{whose job is to}} disrupt a potential fast break resulting from the press; this may leave the offensive center unguarded and able to receive a pass near midcourt or near the basket for an easy score.|$|R

50|$|Al-Jazeera's {{bureau chief}} in Islamabad, Ahmad Zaidan, was wrongly {{identified}} as the most probable member of al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood on their records. Despite the fact it is improbable {{to be a member}} of both groups, he is also widely and publicly known for traveling to meet with radical groups, but was instead identified due to mobile phone surveillance placing him in rural locations.This has been seen to show the failing of the system, as it has misidentified a journalist conducting legitimate, public business as a potential terrorist, whilst also harming freedom of the <b>press</b> and <b>breaking</b> US law on surveillance of journalists.|$|R

50|$|The {{formation}} {{consisted of}} heavily armed, presumably hand-to-hand warriors and less-armored archers grouped in a triangle formation with the warriors {{in the front}} lines protecting the archers in center or rear. Cavalry charging a group in Svinfylking formation were frequently attacked by the outer warriors with spears causing complete chaos among the horses. The Swine Array {{could also be used}} as a wedge to break through enemy lines. Several Svinfylking formations can be grouped in a side by side appearing something like a zig-zag to <b>press</b> or <b>break</b> the opposition's ranks. The weakness of the swine array was that it could not handle flanking. Swine array was based on a monumental shock. If the swine array did not break the enemy lines immediately then the men in the swine array would not hold long.|$|R

5000|$|A switch {{normally}} {{maintains its}} set position once operated. A biased switch contains a mechanism that springs it into another position when released by an operator. The momentary push-button switch {{is a type}} of biased switch. The most common type is a [...] "push-to-make" [...] (or normally-open or NO) switch, which makes contact when the button is <b>pressed</b> and <b>breaks</b> when the button is released. Each key of a computer keyboard, for example, is a normally-open [...] "push-to-make" [...] switch. A [...] "push-to-break" [...] (or normally-closed or NC) switch, on the other hand, breaks contact when the button is pressed and makes contact when it is released. An example of a push-to-break switch is a button used to release a door held closed by an electromagnet. The interior lamp of a household refrigerator is controlled by a switch that is held open when the door is closed.|$|R

50|$|The {{reaction}} to this proposal in the Arab world was very negative. In November 1978, there was an emergency meeting held by the Arab League in Damascus. Once again, Egypt was the main subject of the meeting, and they condemned the proposed treaty that Egypt was going to sign.Sadat was also attacked by the Arab <b>press</b> for <b>breaking</b> ranks with the Arab League and having betrayed the Arab world. Discussions pertaining to the future peace treaty took place in both countries. Israel insisted in its negotiations that the Israel-Egypt treaty should supersede all of Egypt's other treaties, including those signed with the Arab League and Arab states.Israel also wanted access to the oil discovered in the Sinai region. President Carter interjected and informed the Israelis that the U.S. would supply Israel with whatever oil it needed for the next 15 years if Egypt at any point decided not to supply oil to Israel.|$|R
5000|$|The {{government}} cited Mr. Chellaney's dispatches {{published in}} the New York Times, The Times of London and The Guardian to accuse him and the Associated <b>Press</b> of <b>breaking</b> the press-censorship order that had been promulgated {{in the state of}} Punjab. There were three reasons why no formal charges were ever filed. First, the government threat caused outrage in the journalism world and civil liberties organisations. The New York Times took the lead, carrying several editorials severely criticising Indian authorities. In one editorial, titled [...] "Truth on Trial—in India," [...] it said Mr. Chellaney [...] "provoked displeasure by doing his job too well." [...] The Associated Press Managing Editors Association, comprising editors of major US newspapers, adopted a resolution calling on the Indian government to [...] "cease all proceedings, under way and contemplated," [...] pointing out that '"responsible Indian officials have corroborated Mr. Chellaney's news dispatches from Amritsar." [...] Other media organisations also protested.|$|R
5000|$|One {{night in}} Portsmouth, England in 1787, a <b>press</b> gang <b>breaks</b> into a local tavern and presses {{all of the}} men {{drinking}} there into naval service. One of the men inquires as to what ship they will sail on, and the press gang leader informs him {{that it is the}} [...] Upon inquiring as to who the captain is, another of the men is told the captain is William Bligh (Charles Laughton), and attempts to escape, as Bligh is a brutal tyrant who routinely administers harsh punishment to officers and crew alike who lack discipline, cause any infraction on board the ship, or in any manner defy his authority. The Bounty leaves England several days later on a two-year voyage over the Pacific Ocean. Fletcher Christian (Clark Gable), the ship's lieutenant, is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam (Franchot Tone) is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian.|$|R
6000|$|The Roundheads halted {{when they}} reached the river, and formed rapidly into a column, twelve abreast, for the ford was no wider. As they entered the stream a heavy musketry fire opened {{suddenly}} upon them. Men and horses went down, floating away in the river. In spite of their losses the cavalry pressed on, and though numbers fell, gained the opposite bank. Then arose the Royalist cry [...] "King and Covenant!" [...] and the Scottish horse swept down. The head of the column was shattered by the charge, but the Ironsides still <b>pressed</b> on, and <b>breaking</b> the center of the Scottish horse, poured across the river.|$|R

40|$|Analyzing Utah op-ed {{columns and}} {{letters to the}} editor, this essay {{considers}} the news media 2 ̆ 7 s role in framing public debate regarding the 2006 cancellation of the film Brokeback Mountain because of its themes of gay love and homophobia. Our study interrogates journalists 2 ̆ 7 and citizen letter-writers 2 ̆ 7 discourse {{on either side of}} the issue as it played out in the <b>press.</b> The discourse <b>breaks</b> down into two diametrically opposed frames—Defending Zion versus Disrupting Zion—but each argues for the same thing: to protect different perspectives of morality. The values underlying each framing strategy reveal tensions in an LDS Church-dominated culture with a growing “Gentile” population...|$|R
