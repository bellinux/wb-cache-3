40|$|What are the {{determinants}} of contractual arrangements in producer-processor transactions in the Uruguayan beef industry? Coordination has become a strategic issue for this industry, which exports 75 % of its production, not only to assure quality attributes of products but also to explore new market access opportunities. Two contractual arrangements coexist: direct-contracting (48 %) and broker-induced transactions (52 %). In addition, all <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> 46 % of producers use both types of arrangements. Theory: Transaction Cost Economics offers helpful insights to understand reasons for the development and adaptation of different contractual arrangements. Method: we use a logit model with panel data to test the relationship between direct-contracting mechanism and asset specificity, site specificity and frequency. The panel contains population information of producer-processor transactions (77, 458 transactions, 10, 130 <b>producers</b> <b>and</b> 47 <b>processors).</b> Results: The probability of a transaction being aligned with the direct-contracting arrangement increases in transactions with {{a greater degree of}} asset specificity (e. g.,young steer), lower distance between <b>producer</b> <b>and</b> <b>processor</b> <b>and</b> higher frequency of transactions between the two parties involved. The direct-contracting arrangement is aligned with higher quality products. These results have implications for organizations in the beef industry and policy makers in terms of a national strategy focused on higher quality beef products...|$|R
50|$|A {{price band}} {{is a policy}} {{instrument}} that serves to insulate domestic <b>producers</b> <b>and</b> <b>processors</b> when the world price for a commodity falls below a calculated reference price (e.g., a price target comparable to a commodity support level). Protection is provided by imposing a variable import levy on the imported commodity that raises the importer’s cost to the reference price.

40|$|This study {{examines}} supply chain structures and inter-organizational relationship {{factors that influence}} the supply chain performance in the Australian beef industry. It investigated {{the extent to which}} aggregated relationship strength is a source of supply chain performance for the industry. The effect of antecedent factors such as vertical coordination, negotiation power and the use of IOS in the relationship strength were also investigated. Data were collected through a telephone survey in 315 firms including input suppliers, <b>producers,</b> <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> retailers in the beef industry of Western Australia and Queensland. The results support both the direction of theoretical underpinnings from RBV and TCE in the beef industry, that durable buyer-supplier relationships in the supply chain are developed from the level of commitment and trust, interdependence and mutual investment and can be a strategic economic resource to by-pass the cost of traditional market transactions. Results suggest the following key success factors for the beef industry in Australia: (a) the operational adoption of a lean supply chain between <b>producer</b> <b>and</b> <b>processors</b> or <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> retailers; (b) a transparent interdependent relationship with a strong consolidation/integration of business activities; and (c) synchronized information flows for greater compliance with carcass specifications in the supply chain...|$|R

On other hand deboned meat is the base for manufactured products with added value, representing a change in the traditional presentation of poultry, caused by consumers demand. In the change of whole carcass to added value products processors face different issues related to meat quality related to tenderness, color, water holding capacity and cohesion capacity, characteristics reported in chicken and turkey meat.

40|$|Fish roe {{products}} {{have historically been}} seen as expensive and highly-desirable luxury food items. The best and most expensive is true caviar, which uses eggs from sturgeons caught in the Caspian Sea. In recent years, eggs from many other fish species {{have been used to}} develop products imitating original caviar. By utilizing processes appropriate for each kind of fish, it is now possible to make a similar - but nevertheless imitation - product. This publication presents a comprehensive overview of the production of lumpfish caviar as a model for developing fish caviar. The source, lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus), is from the North Atlantic and {{can be used as a}} case study to develop similar products from other fish species. The document describes fishing methods, preservation and storage of the eggs as well as details on the caviar production process itself to obtain the final product, lumpfish caviar. Product safety and packaging are considered, and the rules and regulations that apply to the main markets are discussed. Production and marketing statistics demonstrate the extent of the global lumpfish caviar business.

At present, the Dioptase prototype supports three types of storage: (i) memory storage (fixed or extensible), (ii) file storage, and (iii) database storage (for embedded databases). Unlike <b>producer</b> <b>and</b> <b>processor</b> components, storages have a memory of past states that can be queried a posteriori. A storage component can produce a stream only when it receives a query that expresses some constraints that can be temporal (items between two timestamps, items older than x, etc.), volumetric (the x last items) or a combination of them. The complying results are presented as a new stream that ends when the last item is sent. Each storage type supports these constraints, but some storages can accept specific parameters (e.g., the database storage can handle a SQL query directly).|$|R

First {{an investigation of}} the biomass and bioenergy literature reveals a need for an organizational perspective on emerging bioenergy industries. Second, transaction cost economic theory is applied to the general relationship between biomass <b>producer</b> <b>and</b> <b>processor.</b> Finally the case of the Iogen Corporation is examined to identify their planned biomass supply chain strategy as they attempt to commercialize their cellulose ethanol technology. Two general options emerge: one where processors can choose to enter developed biomass areas and expect to use spot markets with low transaction costs but experience intense competition for biomass and another where the processor enters an undeveloped biomass area, expects the use of long term contracts with higher transaction costs but can expect less intense competition.
