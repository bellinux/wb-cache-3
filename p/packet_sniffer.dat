50|$|The {{protocol}} is {{not completely}} secret; Microsoft disclosed version 2 (MSNP2) to developers in 1999 in an Internet Draft, but never released versions 8 or higher to the public. The Messenger service servers currently only accept protocol versions from 8 and higher, so the syntax of new commands sent from versions 8 and higher is only known by using <b>packet</b> <b>sniffers</b> like Wireshark. This has been an easy task because - in comparison to many other modern instant messaging protocols, such as XMPP - the Microsoft Notification Protocol does not provide any encryption and everything can be captured easily using <b>packet</b> <b>sniffers.</b> The lack of proper encryption also makes wiretapping friend lists and personal conversations a trivial task, especially in unencrypted public Wi-Fi networks.|$|R

40|$|In {{this report}} we provide the {{findings}} of the 2. 4 GHz service level research. Here service level means the following: can all devices in the 2. 4 GHz band fulfill their communication needs. In other words this corresponds to the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The project is a short research ex-ploratory project of about 400 hours in collaboration with Agentschap Tele-com, the Dutch Radiocommunications Agency. First of all a survey has been made to investigate which measurement methods can be used to as-sess the service level in the 2. 4 GHz. Here the focus is on IEEE 802. 11 b/g/n (WiFi) systems. The service level can be measured at several levels of the OSI model: spectrum sensing (physical layer) and <b>packet</b> <b>sniffers</b> (datalink layer). Power level measurements are used to assess the utilization of the 2. 4 GHz ISM band. On the other hand <b>packet</b> <b>sniffers</b> are an appropriate method to measure congestion and to pinpoint problems.

40|$|Slowdown in {{the network}} {{performance}} can cause serious concern to network analysts, leading to loss in resources.

Connectivity loss or shutting down of terminals with{{in the network}} for unknown reasons are among the other problems. Mostly, the cause of these problems cannot be detected accurately and is concluded due to poor network architecture, such as inefficiently configured broadcast storms, spanning-tree, usage of unsuitable routing protocols within the network domain, redundant links etc. However, sometimes the cause could be due to attacks by unknown third parties that try to put the web server out-of-service through means of a DoS (Denial of Service) attack, sending traffic with a poisoned ARP in an attempt to discover hosts to infect, or by simply infecting ports with malware to form part of an alien network or botnet.
