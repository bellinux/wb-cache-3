Results are presented for standard compressive tests and indirect tensile tests (splitting tests on cylinder specimens and flexure tests on prismatic beams using a three-point loading arrangement) under monotonically increasing or cyclically varying loads. The influence of steel fibres and aggregate types on modulus of elasticity, compressive and tensile strength and post-peak behaviour is evaluated. Test results show that compressive strength does not change for <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> aggregates, while an increase is observed for expanded clay; tensile strength and fracture toughness are significantly improved for both <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> and expanded clay. The results also show that with both expanded clay and <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> lightweight aggregates a suitable content of fibres allows one to obtain performances comparable with those expected from normal weight concrete, the important advantage of lower structural weight being maintained...|$|R

In Costa Rica, atenolol, a β-blocker drug, {{has been}} {{identified}} like an organic emerging compound of high incidence in urban wastewater. Due to its continue discharge, its potential chronic effect on exposed aquatic organisms and the limitation of removal in conventional wastewater treatments, it is {{of great interest to}} develop methodologies that contribute to its removal. This research studies the use of <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> as an adsorbent to remove atenolol from wastewater. The adsorption capacity of <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> was characterized by isotherms and kinetics adsorption, including its dependence on pH, using atenolol solutions of 8 mg/L in batch experiments, with <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> of 0, 85 - 1, 18 mm granulometry and 4, 24 m 2 /g of superficial area. The adsorption isotherm results were adjusted to Langmuir model, with an adsorption capacity of 0, 1131 mg/g in water type II and 0. 0439 mg/g in wastewater, both at pH 7, 2. The adsorption kinetics of atenolol on <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> were adjusted to the pseudo second order model, with an equilibrium time of 4, 0 hours.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} a broad audience of rural populations affected by drinking arsenic-contaminated water. Exposure to arsenic in the drinking water {{has been associated with}} the development of skin and internal cancers and non-carcinogenic effects such as diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease (Abernathy et al., 593 – 597). Traditional technologies to remove arsenic from water include: coagulation and filtration, activate alumina, ion-exchange, reverse osmosis, and electro-dialysis. These methods are very expensive to build and operate in rural areas with scattered populations. The focus of this research was to remove the arsenic from drinking water by a sorption process. Batch studies were conducted on twelve adsorbent materials with water containing 100 μg/L arsenic (V). The outcome of the research indicates that iron-oxide-coated <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> (IOCPS) removes both arsenic (III) and arsenic (V). The arsenic (V) appears to be more easily removed than arsenic (III). In a laboratory column test, the breakthrough volume of the iron oxide coated <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> was 4000 bed volumes. The concentration of arsenic in the feed water was 100 μg/L and the effluent concentration was below detection limit (3 ̆c 2 μg/L). Optimum empty bed contact time for arsenic (V) removal by the iron oxide coated <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> was 8 to 10 minutes. The optimum pH for arsenic removal by IOCPS was found to be in the range of 5. 5 to 6. 0. The presence of sulfate, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, and phosphate in the water reduces the arsenic removal capacity of iron-oxide-coated <b>pumice</b> <b>stone.</b> Presence of calcium, magnesium in the water does not effect the arsenic removal by iron oxide coated <b>pumice</b> <b>stone.</b> The residual waste is non-hazardous and can be disposed in landfills. ...|$|R

The aim of this work was to study the technology of acid wash with damp <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> on woven denim apparel (jeans) of 100 % cotton indigo dyed, 3 / 1 twill weave. The effect of acid wash on jeans also investigated. The jeans were processed with damp <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> (400 %) (owm) at room temperature for 15 min without additional water. Phosphoric acid (1 ml/l) and potassium permanganate (4 gm/l) were used for soaking the <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> at room temperature for 10 min by shuffling. It has been explored that acid wash treatment is very effective for woven denim apparel to create an irregular fading effect.

Obtained results were compared and found that breaking strength, stiffness, GSM, dimensional stability, colour depths are decreased.

40|$|International audienceThe {{removal of}} Acid Black 1 dye was {{investigated}} by acid treated <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> as a low cost adsorbent, since acidic modifications {{were expected to}} improve the sorption capacity. The main components of the considered adsorbent were SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 and acid treated pumice shows irregular structure. The effect of various parameters such as the initial dye concentration, the contact time, the temperature and the pH were studied. An increase of the contact time, the initial dye concentration or an acidification of the medium had a positive impact of dye removal. Among the tested isotherms, linear regression analysis showed that the removal of Acid Black 1 dye follows a Temkin model (r 2 > 0. 93). The value of the separation factor (RL) was 0. 17, showing a favorable adsorption. Despite a low specific area (54 m 2 /g), <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> displayed a high sorption capacity (72. 46 mg/g), which should be related to its high porosity (85 %).
