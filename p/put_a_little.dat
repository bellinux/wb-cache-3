I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a particular sound from a steel acoustic guitar. I played these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing and I started playing, and we came up with the basis for the song. I <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> drum groove down {{and it was one of}} the easier songs to write with her.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} the Yukon Quest {{originated}} in April 1983 during a bar-room discussion among four Alaskans: LeRoy Shank, Roger Williams, Ron Rosser, and William [...] "Willy" [...] Lipps. The four proposed a thousand-mile sled dog race from Fairbanks, Alaska to Whitehorse, Yukon, to celebrate the Klondike Gold Rush-era mail and transportation routes between the two. They disdained the many checkpoints and stages of the Iditarod Sled Dog Race and envisioned an endurance race in which racers would rely on themselves and survival would {{be as important as}} speed. [...] "We wanted more of a Bush experience, a race that would <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> woodsmanship into it", Shank said at the race's 25th anniversary.|$|E
500|$|Richardson {{had gained}} a {{national}} {{reputation as a}} great actor while at the Old Vic; films gave {{him the opportunity to}} reach an international audience. Unlike some of his theatre colleagues, he was never condescending about film work. He admitted that film could be [...] "a cage for an actor, but a cage in which they sometimes <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gold", but he did not regard filming as merely a means of subsidising his much less profitable stage work. He said, [...] "I've never been one of those chaps who scoff at films. I think they're a marvellous medium, and are to the stage what engravings are to painting. The theatre may give you big chances, but the cinema teaches you the details of craftsmanship." [...] The Fallen Idol was followed by Richardson's first Hollywood part. He played Dr Sloper, the overprotective father of Olivia de Havilland in The Heiress, [...] based on Henry James's novel Washington Square. The film did not prosper at the box-office despite good reviews, [...] an Academy Award for Best Actress for Havilland, and nominations for the director (William Wyler) and Richardson.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} Cole's cover of Fiona Apple's [...] "Criminal" [...] (1997). Len Righi of The Morning Call wrote {{that she was}} {{surprised}} at Cole's ability to transform the [...] "agonizing, brazen lament" [...] into [...] "a funky, Tina Turner-type, rump-shaker." [...] The second track is a cover of Neil Young's 1972 single [...] "Old Man"; David Munk called it [...] "a personal rumination on her father". The third song, a cover of Aretha Franklin's [...] "Day Dreaming" [...] (1972), was recorded after Austin sang it in the studio. Cole said she [...] "added {{a little bit of}} a hip-hop feel to it". Richard Harrington of The Washington Post felt that the fourth track, a cover of Shelby Lynne's [...] "Leavin'" [...] (1999), [...] "metaphorically <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> distance between the original R diva and the pop star Cole". The fifth song is a cover of Ronnie Dyson's 1976 track [...] "The More You Do it (The More I Like It Done to Me)"; NPR's Jason King attributes the inclusion of [...] "the saucy but largely forgotten Yancy-Jackson mid-'70s track" [...] to his suggestion to Cole's A director. The song contains a homage to Cole's 1975 single [...] "This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)". The seventh track is a cover of Dobie Gray's 1973 single [...] "Loving Arms" [...] (here titled [...] "Lovin' Arms"), which Verve Records marketed as inspired by Etta James, allowing Cole [...] "the opportunity to move back to her 70's roots with rich, shimmering vocals".|$|E

Moyes later recalled [...] "Julian and I used to muck around after Prop rehearsals and play the stupidest music we could...

2500|$|For Gleizes {{and those}} of his entourage 1912 {{signified}} a climax in the debates centering around modernism and classicism – Bergson and Nietzsche – Euclid and Riemann – nationalism and regionalism – Poincaré and four-dimensional space.

My promoter always says that I make the fights very difficult, but they're not difficult, they're fun for the public.

2500|$|Hynde and Honeyman-Scott {{have both}} {{acknowledged}} the influence their contrasting styles had {{on each other}} (Guitar Player, 1981; Uncut, 1999). According to Honeyman-Scott, Hynde had a unique style he adjusted to in several ways: [...] "She does {{quite a bit of}} rhythm guitar, and I don't know anybody who plays like her. It's real distinct, and I can't count her beat half the time. Instead, I just <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> guitar line over it, like the lick in 'Tattooed Love Boys'" [...] (Guitar Player, 1981). He joked about his other strategy: [...] "I've never told them I can't work out their time at all! They are used to me coming in a bar too late; they think that's the way I play. But it's because I've missed where she comes in! I just bluff it and hope for the best." ...|$|E
2500|$|A section {{from the}} {{eleventh}} {{chapter of the}} serial published in New Review (May 1895) was deleted from the book.

[...] "There was a slight struggle," [...] Wells later recalled, [...] "between the writer and W. E. Henley who wanted, he said, to <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> 'writing' into the tale. But the writer was in reaction from that sort of thing, the Henley interpolations were cut out again, and he had his own way with his text."

2500|$|In 1973 all was {{not well}} for Haffkine and Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show, David left the band in and was {{replaced}} by John Wolters. The group had a difficult time meeting the high expectations created by Sloppy Seconds, and the result was Belly Up, which Huey noted [...] "was unfortunately prophetic." [...] "Belly Up" [...] included Acapulco Goldie, Penicillin Penny, Life Ain't Easy, When Lily Was Queen, Monterey, Jack, You Ain't Got The Right, <b>Put</b> <b>A</b> <b>Little</b> Bit On Me, Ballad Of...., Roland The Roadie Gertrude The Groupie, Come On In, The Wonderful Soup Stone. The album was sold in the US, UK, Europe and Canada. Dr. Hook was just as famed for their crazed stage antics, which ranged from surreal banter to impersonating their own opening acts, but it was the group's nonchalance about business matters that led to bankruptcy."If we were in the black when we finished a tour, we'd party into the red," [...] says Locorriere.

2500|$|As {{a junior}} in 1934, Shakespeare became the {{starting}} left halfback in the Notre Dame's first year under new coach Elmer Layden. [...] In an October 1934 win over Carnegie Tech, Shakespeare ran 56 {{yards for a touchdown}} on a sweep play around the right end. [...] The Associated Press noted: [...] "Superb blocking opened the route for Shakespeare, who <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> reverse English on his dash and then outfooted the field to score." [...] On November 24, 1934, he helped lead the Irish to a 126 win over Army with a 67-yard touchdown pass to Dominic Vairo in front of a crowd of 81,000 at Yankee Stadium. [...] The Associated Press wrote that [...] "the Irish scored a touchdown on a sensational pass, Shakespeare to Captain Vairo, who took the ball on Army's 15 as he was surrounded by three cadets and broke away to spring across the goal line." [...] And in the final week of the season, he threw a 51-yard touchdown pass to Francis [...] "Mike" [...] Layden in a 140 win over the University of Southern California. [...] He led the 1934 Notre Dame team in several offensive categories, including passing (230 yards and two touchdowns), kickoff returns (60 yards on four returns), and punting (41 punts for 1,638 yards and a 40.0 yard average).|$|E
2500|$|David Jeffries from Allmusic noted Diddy's [...] "unfiltered self" [...] and [...] "unique attitude", stating [...] "This hook-filled, vibrant {{effort is}} that rare heartbreak album that can speak on a lovelorn level and then <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> strut {{back in your}} step." [...] Matt Sayles from The Boston Globe complimented its concept and praised the mixture of R vocals from Dirty Money and the guest {{features}} from the range of A-list friends, particularly Grace Jones stating that [...] "There’s no telling why she turns up but she sounds right {{at home on the}} thumping club anthem. [...] cameo is just one more pleasant surprise on an album full of them." [...] Brandon Soderberg from The Village Voice was also impressed with the artistic creation. He said [...] "Once you hear Pariss mish-mash (Diddy’s word) of sounds, all that producer-genius experimentalism makes some sense. Every song is full of swift change-ups and jarring musical detours; Diddy often interrupts these jagged dance tracks to emote... It’s lots of fun, and though confessional in parts, it’s overall far from the self-serious, petulant complaint-raps of say, Drake or Kanye. Paris looks back to dance music as soulful catharsis and emotionalism, not the cold thump that’s taken over as of late." [...] Nitsuh Abebe from New York magazine said [...] "Last Train to Paris {{is one of the first}} records that's really made me feel like [...] sounds clever. [...] makes what seems to me to be an aesthetic error, which is that if you want to put sleek, rainy-sounding synths everywhere ... this album hits its mood right, though — gray skies, Eurorail, and drama — it's excellent stuff. The hectic format fades away, and the music actually becomes the hypnotic cruise it aspires to be." ...|$|E
