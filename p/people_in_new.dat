More than 1.5million <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Orleans were advised to leave the city. The nine shelters opened throughout the area were collectively capable of accommodating up to 450,000 people. New Orleans mayor Marc Morial declared a State of Emergency to allow federal assistance into the affected areas during {{the immediate aftermath of}} the hurricane. A curfew was instituted for those who ignored evacuation orders or could not leave the city.|$|E

5|$|Floyd's {{rainfall}} {{resulted in}} deadly and extensive flooding that killed two <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York. Heavy flooding was reported along numerous creeks, including the Esopus, Catskill, and Schoharie. In the Albany area, the Normanskill rose to extremely high levels, {{and the resultant}} flood waters damaged nearby buildings. The Coeymans Creek in Selkirk overflowed and forced 20 families to leave their homes. The main rivers typically remained within their banks. Many roads, including U.S. Route 20 in Guilderland, were flooded or washed out, and seven families had to be evacuated along NY 32 in Menands. Further south, the Saw Mill and Bronx rivers both overflowed, and caused urban flooding. A dam on a mill pond broke near Lake Placid, leading to flooding along the Chubb River.|$|E
5|$|The airship had tumultuous {{times at}} the start. Professor A. W. Bernard of Nashville, Tennessee took claim to his {{invention}} in 1897. Myers sent telegrams to editors of newspapers {{in the month of}} May of that year explaining that he was the inventor of the world's first 'sky-cycle' airship in spite of what Bernard and others said. Myers explained to the newspapers that his invention had already been displayed in front of a group of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York City in August 1895. Myers showed to them that the basic principles of the controllable airship were already patented by him and his wife on May 26, 1885. He further explained that the only 'sky-cycle' patent ever issued to anybody was granted to him on April 20, 1897. Bernard was trying to stake claim that it was his invention and had really just made a duplicate of Myers' previous recorded patents.|$|E

25|$|In 1930, Vermont Governor John E. Weeks invited Flanders to {{join the}} Committee on Traditions and Ideals of the Vermont Commission on Country Life.

In the 1930s, <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> England were turning to music on the radio; as a result, interest in traditional songs was on the wane. Flanders understood that unless these songs were collected and recorded for posterity, they would die along with the people who sang them. What began as a committee assignment became not just a hobby, but a passion. She continued collecting for three decades.|$|E

25|$|New Orleans was {{established}} at a Native American portage between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain. The lake provides numerous recreational activities for <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Orleans {{and is also}} home to the Southern Yacht Club. In the 1920s, the Industrial Canal {{in the eastern part of}} the city opened, providing a direct navigable water connection, with locks, between the Mississippi River and the lake. In the same decade, a project dredging new land from the lake shore behind a new concrete floodwall began; this would result in an expansion of the city into the former swamp between Metairie/Gentilly Ridges and the lakefront. The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, connecting New Orleans (by way of Metairie) with Mandeville, and bisecting the lake in a north-northeast line.|$|E

It was revealed that Hevesi had actually hired four, not the two employees initially thought for his wife's 'security detail' and said employees were running personal errands according to the report from the Attorney General Office. On December 13, 2006, a poll conducted between December 5–11 by Quinnipiac showed that 45% of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York felt that Hevesi should resign and 43% felt he had paid his debt to the state. 1,144 registered voters in New York were polled with a margin of error of +/- 2.9 percent.|$|E
25|$|In 1876, six Japanese {{businessmen}} {{arrived in}} New York City on the Oceanic and established companies. They {{were the first}} Japanese {{people in the state}} of New York. Almost all of the 1,000 Issei in New York State by 1900 were in New York City. The Chinese Exclusion Acts of 1882 restricted Japanese immigration to the United States and the United States and Japanese governments had a gentlemen's agreement where the Japanese would deny visas to laborers wishing to immigrate to the United States in exchange for the U.S. not officially ending Japanese immigration. For those reasons, before the 1950s New York City had few Japanese immigrants. Japanese individuals of higher socioeconomic backgrounds did enter New York City during that period. Until the 1960s there was never a greater number than 5,000 Japanese <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York State.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{increase}} in the population classed as 'Asian' <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Zealand (now 9. 5 %) has seen {{the establishment of an}} 'Asian health' platform with activities by academic institutions, service providers, and community organisations. Howeve, Asian health remains outside the frames of reference for most health professionals. Three recent reports provide the first large-scale systematic data about the health of Asian <b>peoples</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Zealand. These reports identify the problem of 'averaging' if the whole Asian category is used. Key health concerns include access to health services; cardiovascular disease, and diabetes for Indian peoples; levels of physical activity; and mental health, particularly <b>in</b> young <b>people.</b> Asian <b>peoples</b> born <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Zealand are less healthy than recent migrants classified as Asian. This 'healthy immigrant effact' abates with length of settlement <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Zealand. Despite these identified issues, there is a policy void for the health of Asian <b>peoples</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Zealand, with no clear mandate to consider or monitor Asian peoples when undertaking research or formulating policy. Explicit engagement, policy, and service development for this significant and diverse part of the population should build on the agenda laid out by the recent advances in knowledge about Asian health <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Zealand. © NZMA. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
