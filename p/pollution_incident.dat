5|$|There {{was another}} <b>pollution</b> <b>incident</b> in March 2008 when twenty {{miles of the}} river turned orange. Iron oxide from old mine {{workings}} near the source at Irwell Springs had polluted the water since 1969 and in 1997 a Coal Authority survey identified the stretch as having the fourth worst case of minewater pollution in the country. A treatment plant was built in 1999 to remove the pollution {{at a cost of}} £1M; however, it is thought that there was a collapse in the mine after heavy rains in the spring of 2008. Although the water was stained with ochre, no damage to wildlife was reported.|$|E
25|$|A water <b>pollution</b> <b>incident</b> {{occurred}} at the Barrick Gold North Mara Mine in May 2009, when acidic water (pH 4.8) seeped from a mine rock storage facility into the Tigithe River, which is used for irrigation, bathing and as an unprotected source of drinking water.|$|E
25|$|The river {{has been}} famed as a mixed fishery with {{salmon and trout}} fishing, mostly in the upper waters and a good coarse fishery in the lower reaches.

25|$|The {{river is}} crossed by the Llangollen Canal, and by several bridges which {{are on the}} Listed Buildings register. It has {{formerly}} suffered from pollution, both from the discharge of poorly treated sewage from two treatment works, and from effluent from factories producing dairy products. These are now well-regulated, but the river {{was the scene of}} a major <b>pollution</b> <b>incident</b> in 1985, when pig slurry discharged into it, killing around 100,000 fish.|$|E
25|$|The Citizen Report Card {{moreover}} {{indicates that}} septic tanks {{are often used}} for the disposal of wastewater from flush toilets in Mombasa. Pit latrine users from Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa indicated that some wastewater empties into storm sewers, soak-aways and cess pits designed for kitchen waste, thus causing environmental pollution. In 2001 a <b>pollution</b> <b>incident</b> occurred {{in the town of}} Embu. Raw sewage was discharged from sewage treatment works into a nearby river and caused the death of 28 people who used the water downstream for domestic purposes.|$|E

500|$|In July 2000 {{there was}} a setback for the {{clean-up}} programme when a <b>pollution</b> <b>incident</b> affected approximately [...] of the river between Rawtenstall and Ramsbottom, causing the death of more than 36,000 fish. The large number of fish killed, however, did serve to illustrate how much the river had improved from the lifeless, [...] "melancholy stream" [...] of the 1950s. In 2005 a £1M project to make the river [...] "the cleanest {{it has been for}} decades" [...] was announced by United Utilities. The improvements included fitting filters on sewers in Lower Broughton to ensure litter was not washed into the river, as part of a scheme to improve overflows across Adlington, Wigan, Chorley, Rochdale and Bury. Then in October 2008 United Utilities announced that work on the Ringley Fold Wastewater Works in Stoneclough, to be completed {{by the end of the}} year, should increase the number of fish in the river and [...] "massively improve the environment locally so walkers, canoeists and anglers will all reap the benefits."

2500|$|A 1999 {{report in}} the British Medical Journal {{concluded}} that some victims had suffered [...] "considerable damage" [...] to their brain function. This contradicted the 1991 LIHAG report telling residents that their symptoms were due to anxiety. The study was led by a consultant nephrologist at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, {{and was the first}} large-scale clinical study of the affected residents. The report stated that their symptoms were similar to those of Alzheimer's disease, which has also been linked with large quantities of aluminium accumulating in the brain. Rejecting the findings of the LIG, the report called for further research to determine the longer term prognosis for the affected individuals and led to fresh calls for a public inquiry into the <b>pollution</b> <b>incident.</b> Although the study was carried out in 1991, its publication was delayed by the ongoing litigation between SWWA and the victims.|$|E
2500|$|The Camelford water <b>pollution</b> <b>incident</b> {{involved}} the accidental {{contamination of the}} drinking water supply {{to the town of}} Camelford, Cornwall, in July 1988. Twenty tonnes of aluminium sulphate was inadvertently added to the water supply, raising the concentration to 3,000 times the admissible level. As the aluminium sulphate broke down it produced several tonnes of sulphuric acid which [...] "stripped a cocktail of chemicals from the pipe networks as well as lead and copper piping in people’s homes." [...] Many people who came into contact with the contaminated water experienced a range of short-term health effects, and many victims suffered long-term effects whose implications remained unclear [...] There has been no rigorous examination or monitoring of the health of the victims since the incident, which is Britain's worst mass poisoning event. Inquests on people who died many years later found very high levels of aluminium in the brain. Dame Barbara Clayton led a Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution enquiry into the incident.|$|E

By considering the modern geospatial approaches, this research is focused on monitoring environmental pollution in the coastal zone of Kalutara area, with the objective of identification of existing natural resources. Green vegetation patches, water bodies and beech areas were detected using remote sensing techniques. A detailed GPS field survey was conducted and identified minor environmental resources with various <b>pollution</b> <b>incidents.</b> This information was used to improve the available data sets. The types of <b>pollution</b> <b>incidents</b> were categorised according to the severity level by considering the relationship to each natural resource. Maps were created and data was uploaded to the ArcGIS online cloud platform. Web services were hosted using this cloud infrastructure. <b>Pollution</b> <b>incidents</b> data layer has been given web based editing capabilities for field monitoring using GPS enabled mobiles. Field observations were conducted and locations of the pollution effects were uploaded into web maps from the field with related attributes. The hot spots were used to get better understanding and awareness of the environmental pollution. As the results, <b>pollution</b> <b>incidents</b> were identified and there was a significant effect to the minor environmental elements. The cloud infrastructure, helped to bring down the barriers of data sharing and the incident reporting mechanism became more convenient during the field observations...|$|R
