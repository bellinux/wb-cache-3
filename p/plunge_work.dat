30|$|This famous text, if taken {{literally}} and at face value, has many philosophical implications. It does indeed appear {{to rule out}} the possibility of a Marxian ethic in the usual Western sense of the word “ethic,” according to which responsibility is central because we are thought to be free to choose our actions. It suggests that Marx subscribes to a fairly “hard” determinism (though perhaps not a total sort of determinism because Marx allows for the existence of subjective impulses that fall outside the scope of his inquiry), along with a heavily natural scientific bias. (In fact, in the same paragraph Marx says that he is treating economic history as a form of natural history).

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{relatively}} new solid-state welding technology invented at The Welding Institute of UK in 1991. It is versatile and has been widely adopted to join various materials. There has been strong research activity on revealing the details of the material flow pattern in the nugget zone induced by the conventional shoulder tool. However, there is insufficient understanding on the aspects of the scroll shoulder tool design and the shoulder flow zone formation utilizing this type of tool. The major objective {{of this study was to}} conduct experiments, analyse results and then reveal the shoulder flow zone forming mechanism for the scroll shoulder tool. The method used was to identify the flow pattern in the shoulder flow zone using a ‘marker insert’ technique, and then to suggest the forming mechanism of the shoulder flow zone based on the obtained flow pattern; although the ‘marker insert’ technique has never been used to study the shoulder flow zone flow pattern induced by the scroll shoulder tool. Experiments were conducted to examine the thick sections 6061 aluminium ‘marker insert’ welds, which were welded using a scroll shoulder tool at a range of welding parameters. These were followed by quantifying the mass of the accumulated work piece material within the scroll groove (pick up material-PUM), evaluating the effect of welding parameters on the shoulder flow zone formation, and documenting the shoulder flow zone flow pattern. The major finding was that there is a simple banded structure which forms in a layer to layer manner in the bottom portion of the shoulder flow zone, but it disappears in the top portion of the shoulder flow zone. Accordingly, the forming mechanism of the shoulder flow zone for the scroll shoulder tool was suggested as follows. Firstly, the tool pin is <b>plunged</b> into the <b>work</b> piece; the work piece material is extruded by the pin and pushed up into the scroll groove forming the PUM. Secondly, after the tool shoulder is <b>plunged</b> into the <b>work</b> piece to a certain depth, the scroll groove is fully filled up with the PUM. Finally, during the forward movement of the tool, the central portion of PUM is driven downward by the root portion of the pin and then detaches from the pin (tip portion) in a layer to layer manner. It has also found that the thickness of the shoulder flow zone varies with a thicker on the advancing side than on the retreating side, and there is a positive linear relationship between the mass of PUM and the weld quality. This study has revealed for the first time the forming mechanism of the shoulder flow zone, and has improved the understanding of the shoulder flow zone formation using a scroll shoulder tool. It is recommended that a ‘shoulder-breaking’ technique is developed to break the rotating shoulder suddenly and hence embed it into the work piece during FSW, in which a real-time shoulder-work piece couple could be produced for a better three-dimensional examination of the shoulder flow zone...|$|R

An average of nearly 250 Russian researchers left home yearly for Japan to stay one year or more in the ensuing decade. Why did so many Russian researchers seek Japan?

40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a {{solid state}} joining process using a {{rotating}} cylindrical shoulder and threaded pin which is <b>plunged</b> into the <b>work</b> piece to traverse along the join line. Friction Stir Processing (FSP) is a comparatively new process derived from FSW, {{which can be used}} to refine and modify as-cast microstructures for superior properties. In the last decade, several researchers have attempted to evaluate the microstructure and properties inside the stir zone. However, it is important to explain the features occurring outside the stir zone, in particular during multipass FSP (MP-FSP). The aim of this proposed research is to explain the MP-FSP process parameters and their relations to mechanical properties of the processed material, and hence to explain the fracture behaviour of the MP-FSPed material. Experimentally, cast plates of A 356 (Al- 7 Si- 0. 3 Mg) alloy were made. Initial set of experiments with a high tool rotation speed (ω rpm) was conducted to produce maximum stir zone area. However, on finding that this parameter was not suitable (as will be explained), lower ω range FSP experiments were conducted. First, single pass FSP experiments were carried out to understand the flow, particularly outside the stir zone followed by MP-FSP under varying process parameters. Tensile testing was conducted and factors/FS parameters relating to fracture strain, and thus the quality of MP-FSP stir zone were studied and fracture features were examined. It was found that the use of high ω values resulted in the less deformed cast material wedging up into the stir zone of the previous pass. This wedging resulted in low tensile fracture strain. Explanation of Si particle alignment due to wedging and subsequently causing low fracture strain will be given. It will be shown that reducing ω reduces the degree of wedging, as the downward stir flow reduces. However, low ω values are shown to have a detrimental effect, incapable of completely disrupting / healing of tunnel wall oxide films, thus resulting in low fracture strain. It will be shown that with the current FS condition, ω= 1000 rpm is the optimum value...|$|R

Results with saltwater are intermediate between freshwater and seawater results. Bubble chord times tch were also measured. The data were analysed in terms of pseudo-bubble chord length chab = V 1 *tch, which was found to overestimate real bubble chords by 10 to 30 %. The data show that pseudo-bubble chord sizes range from less than 0. 5 mm to more than 10 mm. The average pseudo-chord sizes are between 4 and 6 mm for all water solutions. Comparatively, however, more fine bubbles were detected in seawater than in freshwater. Fine bubbles (less than 0. 5 mm) have a slower rise velocity and their underwater residence time is larger in seawater. They give a visual, misleading appearance to the air-water flow suggesting that very fine bubbles are predominantly entrained in seawater plunging jets. Overall the study contributes to a better understanding of air entrainment and bubble dispersion in vertical circular plunging jets. Differences in air entrainment mechanisms between freshwater and seawater are described. Scales effects are believed to occurs in laboratory wave flumes when the wave height at breaking is less than 0. 25 to 0. 35 m. Experimental results in seawater and saltwater suggest further that classical dimensional analysis of air entrainment is incomplete, and that further physical, chemical and biological fluid properties must be taken into account...|$|R
