25|$|A 3.8 GB file {{stolen from}} Adobe and {{containing}} 152 million usernames, reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org. LastPass, a <b>password</b> <b>security</b> firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords {{and has not}} salted them. Another security firm, Sophos, showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery {{of a lot of}} information with very little effort. According to IT expert Simon Bain, Adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’.|$|E
25|$|The {{prior art}} {{qualification}} for the Live Traffic paper {{centered on the}} public accessibility of a document available on a FTP server. SRI argued that the FTP site was not publicly accessible because one would need the complete FTP address to view the paper. Additionally, the posting was not indexed and could only be found by an ordinary skilled user through “dumb luck”. Symantec and SSI countered that on multiple occasions SRI had provided links to the FTP site to multiple members of the intrusion detection community. Furthermore, SRI’s FTP site had been referenced by Google Groups and was widely regarded as a repository of information for computer security. Robinson’s examination of the case evidence noted that no {{attempts were made to}} limit access via <b>password</b> <b>security.</b> Robinson deemed the Live Traffic paper publicly accessible as established by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the precedent cases In re Bayer, In re Hall, In re Cronyn, and In re Klopfenstein. As such, Robinson ruled that the Live Traffic paper constituted as prior art and that the patents described in the publication were invalid.|$|E

Sony later revealed that the personal information of 77 million users might have been taken, including: names; addresses; countries; email addresses; birthdates; PSN/Qriocity logins, passwords and handles/PSN online IDs. It also stated that it was possible that users' profile data, including purchase history and billing address, and PlayStation Network/Qriocity <b>password</b> <b>security</b> answers may have been obtained. There was no evidence that any credit card data had been taken, but the possibility could not be ruled out, and Sony advised customers that their credit card data may have been obtained. Additionally, the credit card numbers were encrypted and Sony never collected the three digit CVC or CSC number {{from the back of the}} credit cards which is required for authenticating some transactions. In response to the incident, Sony announced a [...] "Welcome Back" [...] program, 30 days free membership of PlayStation Plus for all PSN members, two free downloadable PS3 games, and a free one-year enrollment in an identity theft protection program.|$|E

Recently, provably-secure protocols for PAKE were given in the idealized random oracle/ideal cipher models [2, 8, 19] and in the standard model based on general assumptions [11] or the DDH assumption [14]...|$|R
