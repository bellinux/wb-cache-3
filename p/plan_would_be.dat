5|$|DM's {{expansion}} {{would require}} the construction of 281 miles (452km) of new track, upgrading 598 miles (962km) of existing track (including all of the railroad's mainline track in Minnesota), new mainline connections Owatonna and Mankato, Minnesota, and three new rail yards. The <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the largest new railroad construction in the United States since the completion of Milwaukee Road's Pacific extension to Seattle, Washington, in 1909.|$|E
5|$|On May 11, 2007, GO Transit {{announced}} {{a plan to}} put dedicated bus lanes on the centre median of the parkway, to allow its buses to bypass traffic congestion and promote buses {{as an alternative to}} automobiles. The $12 million <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> paid for by GO. The plan would require testing of soil conditions and an environmental assessment.|$|E
5|$|As {{they return}} to the city, Olivia and Charlie discuss plans with Astrid on how to capture Milo, but realize that since he can predict their every move, any <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> futile, and {{approach}} the hotel directly. Milo leads Olivia on a chase through a construction area including a marked zone where the air is too thin, expecting to crush her under a load of cement bricks. Olivia, unaware of the warning signs for the zone, races through it instead of stopping {{to put on a}} respirator, nearly asphyxiating herself, and dodges the bricks in time to capture Milo. At the center, Dr. Levin notes that Milo's condition is too far advanced to reverse, and only a computer is able to keep up with his thoughts. Madeline sadly leaves the toy horse at Milo's side.|$|E

5|$|However, a {{shortage}} of developers who understood the necessary changes, and performance problems arising from conversion to and from UTF-16, which is rarely used in a web context, led to delays in the project. As a result, a PHP 5.3 release was created in 2009, with many non-Unicode features back-ported from PHP6, notably namespaces. In March 2010, the project {{in its current form}} was officially abandoned, and a PHP5.4 release was prepared containing most remaining non-Unicode features from PHP6, such as traits and closure re-binding. Initial hopes were that a new <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> formed for Unicode integration, but as of 2014 none had been adopted.|$|E
5|$|On the British side, General Clinton {{learned of}} the almost undefended Jamaica Pass from local Loyalists. He drew up a plan {{and gave it to}} William Erskine to propose to Howe. Clinton's plan had the main army making a night march and going through the Jamaica Pass to turn the American flank, while other troops would keep the Americans busy in front. On August 26, Clinton {{received}} word from Howe that the <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used, and that Clinton was to command the advance guard of the main army of 10,000 men on the march through the Jamaica Pass. While they made the night march, General James Grant's British troops along with some Hessians, a total of 4,000 men, were to attack the Americans in front to distract them from the main army coming on their flank. Howe told Clinton to be ready to move out that night, August 26.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{began taking}} pre-orders for the first-generation iPad on March 12, 2010. The only major {{change to the}} device between its {{announcement}} and being available to pre-order was the change {{of the behavior of}} the side switch to perform either sound muting or screen rotation locking (user selectable). The Wi-Fi version of the iPad went on sale in the United States on April 3, 2010. The Wi-Fi+3G version was released on April 30. 3G service in the United States is provided by AT and was initially sold with two prepaid contract-free data plan options: one for unlimited data and the other for 250MB per month at half the price. On June 2, 2010, AT announced that effective June 7 the unlimited <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> replaced for new customers with a 2GB plan at slightly lower cost; existing customers would have the option to keep the unlimited plan. The plans are activated on the iPad itself and can be cancelled at any time.|$|E

5|$|The King's Mountain victors {{and their}} prisoners {{returned}} to McDowell's estate, early on, the morning of, October 10, 1780. From there, the various commanders and their men went their separate ways. Shelby {{and his men}} joined General Daniel Morgan at New Providence, South Carolina. While there, Shelby advised Morgan to take Fort Ninety-Six and Augusta, because he believed the British forces, there were supplying the Cherokee with weapons, for their raids, against colonial settlers. Morgan agreed to the plan, as did General Horatio Gates, the supreme commander of colonial forces in the region. Assured that his <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> carried out, Shelby returned home and promised to return the following spring with 300 men. On his way to Fort Ninety-Six, Morgan was attacked by Banastre Tarleton and gained a decisive victory over him at the Battle of Cowpens. Shelby later lamented the fact, that General Nathanael Greene, who relieved Gates only days after Shelby departed for home, claimed the lion's share {{of the credit for}} Cowpens when it was Shelby's plan that had put Morgan in the position to begin with.|$|E
5|$|Zahorchak {{spearheaded the}} {{establishment}} of the Keystone Exams, state-created math, science and social studies tests that high school students would be required to pass a majority of in order to graduate. The measure was met with criticism by the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and others who felt the <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> expensive and would undermine local school boards' authority to set graduation requirements. The PSBA agreed to support the Keystone Exams under a compromise that schools might not have to give the tests if their own final exams are rigorous enough. The Keystone Exams were approved in 2009 and will first take effect starting with the class of 2015. Zahorchak also established the state's Standards Aligned System, which created a standardized set of diagnostic tests and curriculum guides for local school districts. The standards were aligned to six components: a curriculum framework, assessment systems, best teaching practices, emotional support practices, proven research resources and best interventions for accommodations for children who struggle. Within two years, most public school districts within Pennsylvania were using Standards Aligned System in some form.|$|E
5|$|The four spies head to City Hall to warn Mayor West {{about the}} sleeper agent, but they {{discover}} that the mayor is the sleeper agent when Aykroyd inadvertently uses the trigger phrase. During the ensuing fight, Aykroyd plants a homing beacon on Mayor West's leg. West escapes to Russia and the four follow him. They are quickly captured under orders of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who explains that the sleeper agent <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> an embarrassment to their government if revealed to the public. He offers to help them stop West from fulfilling his pre-programmed mission. When the four find West, they see him launch a nuclear missile aimed at the United States before he snaps out of his trance. Mayor West holds himself responsible for America's fate, though Brian comforts him {{with the knowledge that}} West was not in control of his actions, having been brainwashed by the Soviets. Aykroyd realizes that he can hack into the missile's guidance system. This allows him to aim the missile's warhead high above the Earth's atmosphere and harmlessly explode, saving the US. The fuselage, though, crashes into Cleveland's house in Stoolbend, Virginia, while Cleveland was taking a bath, eliciting confusion from his neighbor, Tim the Bear. The episode ends with Brian and Stewie in the family living room as they recount their adventure and repeat the activation phrase, which reveals Meg to be another sleeper agent.|$|E
25|$|Neither {{reorganization}} plan accommodated {{the fiscal}} year for the U.S. budget, so on July 1, 1939, Congress passed a joint resolution under which funding for both <b>plans</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> effective on July 1, 1939.|$|R

25|$|In 2010, FWP {{officials}} also approved {{a plan to}} restore westslope cutthroat trout to the Smith River. The plan involved poisoning other trout species in the upper Smith River drainage, and then introducing cutthroat in two locations a year later. The success of the <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> assessed several years later, once the cutthroat {{had a chance to}} take hold. By 2014, there were five populations of nonhybridized westslope cutthroat trout in the Smith River watershed.|$|E
25|$|Galluccio {{presented}} an investment program on June 5, 2012, to increase oil exploration by tenfold {{and gas exploration}} by twenty-fold, {{with the goal of}} raising production of oil and gas by 6% annually and of refined fuel by over 7% annually over five years. The US$39 billion <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> largely self-financed, as well as by investments from Chevron Corporation and the periodic issuance of high-yield, 8.75% corporate bonds. These bond issuances were raised to US$1.5 billion per series in April 2015, as demand surged to US$4 billion.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, {{genocide}} {{does not}} necessarily mean the immediate destruction of a nation, except when accomplished by mass killings of all members of a nation. It is intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves. The objectives of such a <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the disintegration of the political and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion, and the economic existence of national groups, and the destruction of the personal security, liberty, health, dignity, and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups.|$|E

25|$|For many years, it was {{expected}} that Iarnród Éireann, the state railway company, would extend the Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) with a spur off the Dublin to Belfast line that would serve the airport and Swords. These plans were replaced with plans for an underground metro line, which would run from the city centre to Swords via the airport. The route for the line, Metro North, was announced on 19 October 2006 and was designed to connect with several other modes of transport. On 12 August 2011, it was announced that the Metro North <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> deferred indefinitely {{due to a lack of}} resources to fund the project.|$|E
25|$|Barillas {{was unique}} among all liberal presidents of Guatemala between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his {{successor}} peacefully. When election time approached, he sent {{for the three}} Liberal candidates to ask them what their government <b>plan</b> <b>would</b> <b>be.</b> Satisfied with the response of Reyna Barrios, Barillas made sure a huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicapán Indigenous people {{came down from the}} mountains to vote for the general. The official agents did their job: Reyna was elected president and, so as not to offend the losing candidates, Barillas gave them checks to cover the costs of their presidential campaigns. Reyna Barrios of course received nothing, but he went on to become President on March 15, 1892.|$|E
