Now known as GALCIT Project Number 1, they continued to be ostracized by other Caltech scientists who grew increasingly irritated by their accidents and noise pollution, and were made to relocate their experiments back to the Arroyo Seco, at a site with unventilated, corrugated iron sheds that served as both research facilities and administrative offices. It was here that JPL would be founded.

In some puzzle sections, the player actually takes direct control of Shadow to reach areas that the human character cannot.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{performance}} of <b>popular</b> molecular <b>mechanics</b> (MM) force fields in treating problems that involve ion-channel interactions is explored. We have used quantum mechanical/ molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations {{to compute the}} electrostatic potential inside the selectivity filter of the KcsA potassium channel. A comparison is made with the result of classical electrostatic calculations with nonpolarizable MM force fields (AMBER, CHARMM, and GRO-MOS). An effective procedure is proposed to improve force field charges by performing a fit on the electrostatic potential computed along QM/MM simulations, using a dynamical electrostatic potential derived charge set. The optimized charge set is able to reproduce the QM/MM electrostatic potentials along the channel axis within 1 - 2 kcal/mol, which represents an improvement relative to the corresponding electrostatic potentials obtained with popular MM force fields. By providing quantum mechanical benchmark charges and energies for the KcsA selectivity filter, we hope to facilitate developments toward the modeling of ion channels by providing an objective test as to whether a given implementation of a new, polarizable, model represents a real improvement over existing fixed point charge models. 1...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} shortcomings of macromolecular energy minimization and molecular dynamics techniques is that they generally do not preserve the native structure of proteins as observed by x-ray crystallography. This deformation of the native structure means that these methods are not generally used to refine structures produced by homology-modeling techniques. Here, we use a database of 75 proteins to test {{the ability of a}} variety of <b>popular</b> molecular <b>mechanics</b> force fields to maintain the native structure. Minimization from the native structure is a weak test of potential energy functions: It is complemented by a much stronger test in which the same methods are compared for their ability to attract a near-native decoy protein structure toward the native structure. We use a powerfully convergent energy-minimization method and show that, of the traditional molecular mechanics potentials tested, only one showed a modest net improvement over a large data set of structurally diverse proteins. A smooth, differentiable knowledge-based pairwise atomic potential performs better on this test than traditional potential functions. This work is expected to have important implications for protein structure refinement, homology modeling, and structure prediction...|$|R
