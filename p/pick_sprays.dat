50|$|In horticulture, dwarfing can be {{considered}} a desirable characteristic in modern orchards. This kind of dwarfing can be attained through selective breeding, genetic engineering, or more often, scions are grafted on to dwarfing rootstocks. Almost all modern apples in commercial use are propagated as dwarf or semi-dwarf trees for ease of <b>picking</b> and <b>spraying.</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an innovative technique for colorization of grayscale images. Here the colors from some source color image are <b>picked</b> up and <b>sprayed</b> into the to be colored grayscale image. The color palette used in colorization technique discussed here is generated using the Linde Buzo and Gray (LBG) codebook. The technique is tested using various VQ codebook sizes lik...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} homogeneity, which <b>picks</b> out <b>sprays</b> {{from the general}} run of systems of second-order {{ordinary}} differential equations in the geometrical theory of such equations, is generalized so as to apply to equations of higher order. Certain properties of the geometric concomitants of a spray are shown to continue to hold for higher-order systems. Thirdorder equations play a special role, because a strong form of homogeneity may apply to them. The key example of a single third-order equation which is strongly homogeneous in this sense states that the Schwarzian derivative of the dependent variable vanishes. This equation is of importance {{in the theory of}} the association between third-order equations and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds due to Newman and his co-workers...|$|R
60|$|When the {{gorgeous}} color {{began to fade}} out of the sky, Cicely said her mother would be wondering {{what had become of}} her, and together they went down the hill, and along the roadside, where they stopped to <b>pick</b> some tall <b>sprays</b> of goldenrod, and through the orchard, and around by the barnyard, where Mike was milking, and where Ralph stopped while Cicely went on to the house.|$|R
50|$|Going nowhere at 16, {{bored and}} {{frustrated}} with school, {{aware of the}} world's flaws but feeling helpless to correct them, James Brown's hero/narrator, Virgil, idly <b>picks</b> up a <b>spray</b> paint can and says in bold script {{what he thinks of}} it all, on the side of an abandoned building. Accosted by two burly policement, in an instant he is Going Fast. First to reform school, where he meets JT, a confirmed incorrigible. Then into a low-paying, grimy job, living in the San Jose slum. Learning from JT, becoming his partner, Virg gradually claims his own destiny and identity, through ten rapidly moving, freewheeling days in and around San Francisco drug traffic... There are no bad or good guys, angels or devils, only people, who can be and often are both.|$|R
5000|$|This {{species is}} widely {{mentioned}} in ancient Indian poetry as the chātak. [...] According to Indian mythology {{it has a}} beak atop its head and it thirsts for the rains. The poet Kalidasa used it in his [...] "Meghadoota" [...] {{as a metaphor for}} deep yearning and this tradition continues in literary works. Satya Churn Law, however noted that in Bengal, the bird associated with the [...] "chatak" [...] of Sanskrit was the common iora unlike the Jacobin cuckoo suggested by European orientalists. He further noted that a captive iora that he kept drank water only from dew and <b>spray</b> <b>picked</b> up from plant leaves suggesting that {{it may have been the}} basis for the idea that the [...] "chatak" [...] only drank raindrops. To compound the issues with matching vernacular names, it has been pointed out that in Bengal chātak also refers to skylarks (which are also crested).|$|R
5000|$|Leiningen {{puts on a}} {{makeshift}} protective suit, douses himself with gasoline, <b>picks</b> up two <b>spray</b> cans of gas, and runs for the dam — through the ants. He reaches the dam controls and floods the plantation; this means {{the death of his}} year's crop, but it will save his men, preserve the contents of his granaries, and destroy the menace of the ants for everyone else. The climax of the story occurs on the return journey when he is knocked down by the ants and almost eaten. Thinking about a stag he had seen the ants devour to the bones, he forces himself to get up. Despite suffering horrible injuries, including ant bites to the inside of his nose and directly below his eyes, Leiningen continues running, reaches the concrete ditch with the blazing petrol, and survives. At the story's end, Leiningen awakes while recovering from his injuries; his first words are: [...] "I told you I would come back, even if I am a bit streamlined." ...|$|R
2500|$|Northern <b>Spray</b> <b>picked</b> up 143 {{survivors}} from North Britain, Harbury, Harperly, and West Maximus by 0700 and was detached to {{take the}} rescued men to Newfoundland. Loosestrife {{assumed the role of}} rescue ship and picked up the survivors from Bristol City and Wentworth. At 1057 Oribi sighted a surfaced U-boat at [...] U-223, U-231, U-621, and U-634 dived as Oribi approached. [...] Oribi dropped 14 depth charges after the U-boats dived. U-638 torpedoed Dolius at 1240. Sunflower gained an ASDIC contact at [...] within minutes and destroyed U-638 with a pattern of ten depth charges before rescuing survivors from Dolius. [...] Tay, Oribi, and Offa refueled from convoy oilers that afternoon. [...] Selvistan, Gharinda, and Bonde were hit by a salvo of four torpedoes from U-266 within the space of a few minutes about 1950. Selvistan and Bonde sank within two minutes. Tay rescued survivors from the three ships while Offa made depth charge attacks damaging U-266, which was sunk by aircraft on 15 May while attempting to reach base for repairs.|$|R
6000|$|Yes, it was {{a charming}} village, and a charming country; but, above all, it was {{rendered}} habitable and pleasurable {{for a man of}} taste by the informing presence of Christina Eliot. [...] "I don't think I shall propose to Christina this week after all," [...] thought Walter Dene as he strolled along lazily. [...] "The most delightful part of love-making is certainly its first beginning. The little tremor of hope and expectation; the half-needless doubt you feel as to whether she really loves you; the pains you take to pierce the thin veil of maidenly reserve; the triumph of detecting her at a blush or a flutter when she sees you coming--all these are delicate little morsels to be rolled daintily on the critical palate, and not to be swallowed down coarsely at one vulgar gulp. Poor child, she is on tenter-hooks of hesitation and expectancy all the time, I know; for I'm sure she loves me now, I'm sure she loves me; but I must wait a week yet: she will be grateful to me for it hereafter. We mustn't kill the goose that lays the golden eggs; we mustn't eat up all our capital at one extravagant feast, and then lament the want of our interest ever afterward. Let us live another week in our first fool's paradise before we enter on the safer but less tremulous pleasures of sure possession. We can enjoy first love but once in a lifetime; let us enjoy it now while we can, and not fling away the chance prematurely by mere childish haste and girlish precipitancy." [...] Thinking which thing, Walter Dene halted a moment by the churchyard wall, <b>picked</b> a long <b>spray</b> of scented wild thyme from a mossy cranny, and gazed into the blue sky above at the graceful swifts who nested in the old tower, as they curved and circled through the yielding air on their evenly poised and powerful pinions.|$|R
