40|$|ObjectivesTemporary {{epicardial}} <b>pacing</b> <b>wires</b> {{are commonly}} placed during pediatric cardiac surgery. Data are sparse on postoperative pacing in this population. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the frequency of use and identify predictors for the use of temporary epicardial <b>pacing</b> <b>wires.</b> MethodsPerioperative data were prospectively collected on all patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution (n =  162). ResultsA total of 117 (72 %) patients had temporary epicardial <b>pacing</b> <b>wires</b> placed. Postoperatively, 23 (20 %) of 117 patients had hemodynamic improvement with the use of temporary epicardial <b>pacing</b> <b>wires.</b> Indications for <b>pacing</b> were slow junctional rhythm (11 / 23 [48 %]), junctional ectopic tachycardia (7 / 23 [31 %]), pace termination of supraventricular tachycardia (3 / 23 [13 %]) and atrial flutter (1 / 23 [4 %]), and complete heart block (1 / 23 [4 %]). By using univariate analysis, single-ventricle anatomy, heterotaxy, the Fontan procedure, use of circulatory arrest, intraoperative arrhythmia, pacing in the operating room, and use of vasoactive medications were predictors for hemodynamic improvement with the use of temporary epicardial <b>pacing</b> <b>wires</b> (P < . 05). On multivariate analysis, the Fontan procedure, circulatory arrest, and intraoperative arrhythmias were independent predictors (P < . 01). When excluding all patients with any of these 3 risk factors, only 2 % were paced. Patients with clinically significant pacing had longer chest tube drainage (P < . 01) and intensive care unit length of stay (P < . 01). There were no complications associated with temporary epicardial <b>pacing</b> <b>wires.</b> ConclusionsThe Fontan procedure, use of circulatory arrest, and intraoperative arrhythmias were associated with hemodynamic improvement with postoperative pacing and might represent indications for empiric intraoperative placement of temporary epicardial <b>pacing</b> <b>wires.</b> Patients without these risk factors were less likely to require pacing. Temporary epicardial <b>pacing</b> <b>wires</b> were safe and useful in the management of arrhythmias after pediatric cardiac surgery...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThoracic {{surgical}} procedures {{and the use}} of cardiac devices such as pacemakers are becoming increasingly prevalent in the population. As such, dermatologists may have a greater likelihood of encountering previously implanted or abandoned surgical material in the course of dermatologic surgery on the chest wall.

ObjectiveWe present a review on temporary epicardial <b>pacing</b> <b>wires,</b> temporary transvenous <b>pacing</b> <b>wires,</b> pacemaker leads, and surgical steel sutures in the context of dermatologic surgery. MethodsA literature review was performed on frequently used wire material in patients with a history of cardiac surgery as well as related dermatologic complications from these materials. Results & ConclusionDermatologic surgeons should particularly be aware that temporary epicardial <b>pacing</b> <b>wires</b> and pacemaker leads are not uncommonly abandoned in the chest wall of many patients.

40|$|ObjectiveTemporary biventricular pacing {{to treat}} low output states after cardiac surgery {{is an active}} area of investigation. Reoperative cases are not studied due to adhesions, which {{preclude}} left ventricular mobilization to place epicardial <b>pacing</b> <b>wires.</b> In such patients, inserting a temporary left ventricular lead via the coronary sinus cardioplegia cannula may allow for biventricular pacing. We developed a novel technique for intraoperative left ventricular lead placement. MethodsEight domestic pigs underwent median sternotomy and pericardiotomy. Temporary <b>pacing</b> <b>wires</b> were sewn to the right atrium and right ventricle. Complete heart block was induced by ethanol ablation of the atrioventricular node. A 13 -French retrograde cardioplegia catheter was introduced via the right atrial free wall into the coronary sinus. A 6 -French left ventricular pacing lead was inserted into the cardioplegia catheter and advanced into the coronary sinus during biventricular pacing until left ventricular capture was detected by electrocardiogram and arterial pressure monitoring. Left ventricular capture success rate and electrical performance were recorded during five placement attempts. ResultsLeft ventricular capture was achieved on 80 % of insertion attempts. Left ventricular capture without diaphragmatic pacing was achieved in 7 pigs. Lead tip locations were mostly in lateral and posterior basal coronary vein branches. There were no arrhythmias, bleeding, or perforation associated with lead insertion. ConclusionsIntraoperative biventricular pacing with a left ventricular pacing lead inserted via the coronary sinus cardioplegia cannula is feasible, using standard instrumentation and without requiring cardiac manipulation.

40|$|Introduction: Temporary {{epicardial}} <b>pacing</b> <b>wires</b> (TEPW) {{have been}} routinely used in cardiac surgery in early postoperative period. Purpose {{of the study}} is to determine predictors for need of temporary <b>pacing</b> <b>wires</b> after surgery that will safely limit their usage and to document complications associated with the wires. Patients and Methods: This prospective study involved 112 patients operated at our institution from April 2010 to October 2010, who received TEPW following surgery. Surgical procedures included 34 isolated coronary revascularization, 51 valve replacement, 11 revascularization with valve replacement, 14 mitral reconstruction, 2 ascending aorta replacement. Results: Among 112 patients, 93 (83. 1 %) were never paced. Nineteen (16. 9 %) patients required pacing during weaning and 10 patients, required further pacing in intensive care unit. Indications for pacing included atrioventricular block in 7 (36. 8 %), sinus bradycardia in 2 (10. 5 %), junctional rhythm in 9 (47. 4 %) and low cardiac output in 1 (5. 2 %) patient. Atrioventricular block, junctional rhythm, postperfusion atrial fibrillation, inotropic agent requirement leaving the operating room, pacing requirement during weaning and mitral surgery are found to be the predictors for requirement of TEPWs. No complications were observed related with the use or removal of TEPWs. Conclusion: Routine placement of TEPWs is not necessary after cardiac surgery. Patients having rhythm disturbances after procedure and requiring pacemacer support during weaning of cardiopulmonary by-pass, require further pacemaker support in intensive care unit with higher probability. Depending on our data, because of potential complications related with use of wires, selective use of TEPWs for patients with identified predictors can be recommended...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveRisk {{factors for}} poor outcome with {{congenital}} complete heart block include prematurity, low birth weight, hydrops, low ventricular rates, and congenital heart disease. In this group, medical therapy is often ineffective, pacing is technically challenging, and mortality exceeds 80 %. The {{purpose of this}} study is to assess outcomes of patients with congenital complete heart block who were paced in the first 24 hours after birth owing to the presence of known risk factors. MethodsWe performed a retrospective review of patients with congenital complete heart block paced in the first 24 hours after birth at our institution between November 1, 1995, and July 31, 2007. ResultsThirteen patients were identified, 4 of whom had heterotaxy syndrome. Eleven patients had temporary epicardial <b>pacing</b> <b>wires</b> placed; 2 received permanent pacemakers as the initial mode of pacing. There were 7 deaths (54 % mortality) at a mean age of 19. 9 ± 19 days. Among 7 patients with structural heart disease, there was 1 survivor. Among 6 patients with structurally normal hearts, there were 5 survivors (P =. 025). Patients with temporary wires who survived to permanent pacemaker implantation (6 / 11) used their temporary leads for 33. 8 ± 18. 3 days. ConclusionsIn the severely affected fetus with congenital complete heart block and significant structural heart disease, outcomes remain poor; however, neonates with congenital complete heart block and structurally normal hearts who are monitored antenatally and delivered in a planned fashion at an institution capable of early pacing can have favorable outcomes. The use of temporary <b>pacing</b> <b>wires</b> is an option in the management of these patients...|$|R
