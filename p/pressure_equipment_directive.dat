50|$|In Europe, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) {{has adopted}} the ISO {{standards}} on welder qualification (ISO 9606), {{to replace the}} old European EN 287 series. Operators of automated welding systems are certified according to EN 1418. In Europe welders are often certified by third party Personnel Certification Bodies, like The Welding Institute (TWI/CSWIP). Welders involved {{in the manufacture of}} equipment that falls within the scope of the <b>Pressure</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>Directive</b> must be approved by a competent third party which may be either a notified body or a third-party organization recognized by a Member State.|$|E
50|$|Valves are {{typically}} rated for maximum temperature and pressure by the manufacturer. The wetted materials in a valve are usually identified also. Some valves rated {{at very high}} pressures are available. When a designer, engineer, or user decides to use a valve for an application, he/she should ensure the rated maximum temperature and pressure are never exceeded and that the wetted materials are compatible with the fluid the valve interior is exposed to. In Europe, valve design and pressure ratings are subject to statutory regulation under the <b>Pressure</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>Directive</b> 97/23/EC (PED).|$|E
5000|$|Central {{certification}} is {{more widely}} used in the European Union, where certifications are issued by accredited bodies (independent organizations conforming to ISO 17024 and accredited by a national accreditation authority like UKAS). The <b>Pressure</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>Directive</b> (97/23/EC) actually enforces central personnel certification for the initial testing of steam boilers and some categories of pressure vessels and piping. European Standards harmonized with this directive specify personnel certification to EN 473. Certifications issued by a national NDT society which {{is a member of}} the European Federation of NDT (EFNDT) are mutually acceptable by the other member societies [...] under a multilateral recognition agreement.|$|E

5000|$|Pressure {{vessels are}} {{designed}} to operate safely at a specific pressure and temperature, technically {{referred to as the}} [...] "Design Pressure" [...] and [...] "Design Temperature". A vessel that is inadequately designed to handle a high pressure constitutes a very significant safety hazard. Because of that, the design and certification of pressure vessels is governed by design codes such as the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code in North America, the <b>Pressure</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>Directive</b> of the EU (PED), Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS), CSA B51 in Canada, Australian Standards in Australia and other international standards like Lloyd's, Germanischer Lloyd, Det Norske Veritas, Société Générale de Surveillance (SGS S.A.), Lloyd’s Register Energy Nederland (formerly known as Stoomwezen) etc.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Pressure</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>Directive</b> (PED) 2014/68/EU (formerly97/23/EC) [...] of the EU {{sets out}} the {{standards}} for the design and fabrication of pressure equipment ("pressure equipment" [...] means steam boilers, pressure vessels, piping, safety valves and other components and assemblies subject to pressure loading) generally over one litre in volume and having a maximum pressure more than 0.5 bar gauge. It also sets the administrative procedures requirements for the [...] "conformity assessment" [...] of pressure equipment, for the free placing on the European market without local legislative barriers. It has been mandatory throughout the EU since 30 May 2002, with 2014 revision fully effective as of 19 July 2016. [...] This is enacted in the UK as the Pressure Equipment Regulations (PER).The set out standards and regulations regarding pressure vessels and boilers safety is also {{very close to the}} US standards defined by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). This enables most international inspection agencies to provide both verification and certification services to assess compliance to the different pressure equipment directives.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide the Commission with the {{information}} necessary for the assessment of the economic, social, and environmental impacts of a possible extension of the scope of the EU product safety legislation (ATEX Directive 2014 / 34 /EU, <b>Pressure</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>Directive</b> 2014 / 68 /EU and Machinery Directive 2006 / 42 /EC) with respect to equipment intended for the use in the offshore oil and gas industry. Whereas equipment on fixed units is in the scope of these three Directives, mobile offshore units and equipment installed on them are currently in general excluded. In addition the <b>Pressure</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>Directive</b> excludes also well-control equipment.
