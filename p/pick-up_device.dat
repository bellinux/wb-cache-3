5000|$|After {{the passing}} of the Air Mail Act of 1930 many small Airlines were forced to merge {{in order to meet the}} new {{government}} requirements. Cliff merged his Cleveland-Pittsburgh-Washington passenger line with the new Pennsylvania Air Lines (PAL). Officers of the new [...] "Path of the Eagle" [...] were Cliff Ball as President and general manager; R Park Marshall as Vice-President and Director; Arthur Ball as Secretary and Treasurer; and W C Smith as Director. The merger would keep Pittsburgh on the feeder line connecting the transcontinental route. Synchronizing the [...] "Path of the Eagle" [...] allowed travel from Oakland, CA to NY using connections with Boeing Lines, Pittsburgh Airways, Stout Air Lines, and Western Air Express. With the merger came new services and rates encompassing all Cliff's business. Cliff added passenger service to Cleveland, Chicago, St Louis and St Paul. Service between New Castle, Chicago, and Washington was added. The Akron, Youngstown, and New Castle line was inaugurated by the Tri-motored Ford piloted by R L Baker. And the use of the new Adams airmail <b>pick-up</b> <b>device</b> in cities between Pittsburgh and Cleveland was started for the smaller towns without airfield. [...] Another first for Pittsburgh was the new service of Week-end air trip excursions to Cleveland and Washington and Sunday Service. Because of improved patronage and equipment Cliff reduced rates four times within one year.|$|E

40|$|A doorframe-typed swing {{seedling}} <b>pick-up</b> <b>device</b> for automatic field transplanters {{was developed}} and evaluated in a laboratory. The device, consisting of a path manipulator and two grippers, can move the pins slowly to extract seedlings from the tray cells and return quickly to the pick-up point for the next extraction. The path manipulator was constructed with the creative design of type-II mechanism combination in series. It consists of an oscillating guide linkage mechanism and a grooved globoidal cam mechanism. The gripper is a pincette-type mechanism using the pick-up pins to penetrate into the root mass for seedling extraction. The dynamic analysis of the designed seedling <b>pick-up</b> <b>device</b> was simulated with ADAMS software.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of repeated collection and enzymatic isolation {{of large numbers}} of viable primordial and primary follicles from living donor cows were tested. Ovarian cortical biopsies were collected transvaginally by the Biopsy <b>Pick-Up</b> (BPU) <b>device,</b> a modi. cation of an Ovum Pick-Up instrument. Follicles were enzymatically isolated from the retrieved cortical tissue samples, and follicle viability was determined by a live/dead. fluorescent assay. Six cows were subjected to BPU once per week during 4 consecutive weeks, and in each BPU session 4 cortical tissue samples were collected per ovary. Over the 4 -week trial period, a total of 1443 primordial and primary follicles were collected, 1358 (94 %) of which were primordial and 85 (6 %) were primary follicles. In each BPU session, an average 60. 1 +/- 10. 7 (mean +/- SEM) primordial and primary follicles were isolated per cow. The number of follicles varied considerably throughout the trial period and between cows. Statistical analysis of the data, however, did not support the presence of any distinct trends in the follicle yields over time or between cows. A total of 111 enzymatically isolated follicles were analyzed for viability with fluorescent probes. The vast majority of isolated follicles (92. 8 %) were totally viable. We conclude that the standardized BPU procedure generates sufficiently large numbers of vital primordial and primary follicles, thus validating BPU as a new tool for research into early bovine follicular development...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a vacuum seeder depends on several variables that interact in a complex way. The maximum distance at which seeds may be picked up from the nozzle, depends on {{the dimensions of the}} nozzle, on the depression applied at the nozzle and on the shape and dimensions of the seeds themselves. A mathematical model was devised, based on the general principles of fluid dynamics, and valid for seeds with a round shape, to identify the major parameters regulating the phenomenon. Experimental tests, with a vacuum <b>pick-up</b> <b>device,</b> were carried out to measure the maximum distance at which pick-up took place, when the depression was varied in the interval from zero to 80 kPa. The tests were carried out for four different types of seeds and seven different nozzles. For all nozzles and seeds tested, it was found that depressions in excess of 20 kPa did not substantially increase the pick-up distance. © 1996 Silsoe Research Institute...|$|E
40|$|A {{self-propelled}} miner for deep-seabed manganese nodules {{was developed}} {{for the purpose of}} evaluations of mining performance and viability for scale-up. The test miner crawls on the seafloor by two tracks and separates the nodules from seafloor by hybrid <b>pick-up</b> <b>device.</b> The weight and size are 10 tons in air (5 tons in water) and 5 m(L) × 4 m(W) × 3 m(H), respectively. It is operated electro-hydraulically in real-time via umbilical cable. Software’s for real-time remote control, monitoring and database systems were developed as well. Shallow water tests of the test miner were performed in 100 m water depth of an inshore condition site. Glass beads (d= 19 mm, m= 10 g/ea) were made for artificial nodules instead of real nodules. Non DP barge (W= 19 m, L= 51 m) was used as surface unit.

40|$|Mechanical {{amplitude}} magnified mechanism Abstract. Demands {{of precision}} molds with complicated microstructures for digital {{devices such as}} DVD <b>pick-up</b> system, medical <b>devices</b> such as µ-TAS and solar optics etc. are increasing [1 - 5]. The structured molds must be polished after grinding or cutting {{in order to improve}} the surface roughness. In this paper, a two dimensional low frequency vibration (2 DLFV) polishing actuator using PZT is proposed and developed. The 2 DLFV consists of 4 mechanical amplitude magnified actuators (MechaTrans), a multilayer stacked piezoelectric actuator (PZT) incorporated with mechanical transformer, and a center piece. Mechanical transformer is a kind of flexure hinges structured that magnifies the stroke of the multilayer stacked piezoelectric actuator around 7 times to 120 µm. With this actuation, the tool vibrates in a circle trajectory to achieve polishing effect. In the polishing experiments, tungsten carbide molds (workpieces) are polished with diamond slurry. The surface roughness of the work pieces and polishing efficiency are evaluated. From the experimental results, it was found that low frequency vibration especially 2 DLFV is a useful polishing system for micro structured mold...|$|R
