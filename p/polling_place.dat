Question 21 on the survey asked {{for the number of}} polling places: (1) that could be accessed by a voter who uses a wheelchair, 2) where a visually impaired voter could cast a private ballot, and 3) where a physically disabled voter could cast a ballot on an accessible voting system. Applicability and Coverage As noted earlier in chapter 13 on <b>polling</b> <b>places,</b> the Election Day Survey unveiled some differences in how states treated precincts versus <b>polling</b> <b>places.</b> While most states reported data for both precincts and <b>polling</b> <b>places,</b> a handful of states reported data for only one item.

5|$|In the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, Hamersley {{is split}} between the electorates of Girrawheen and Balcatta, ordinarily both safe seats for the Australian Labor Party. At <b>polling</b> <b>place</b> level, Hamersley {{supported}} the Liberal Party at every election since its first in 1971 until the 1996 election. In both the 2001 and 2005 elections, polling places in Hamersley, as with those in many northern Perth suburbs, switched to the Australian Labor Party at state level. However, at the 2008 and 2013 elections, the suburb returned a majority for the Liberals.|$|E

5|$|At federal level, Hamersley {{is within}} the Division of Stirling, a {{marginal}} seat which historically has alternated between the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party.

At <b>polling</b> <b>place</b> and subdivision level, Hamersley has supported the Liberal Party at every election since its first in 1972, the only exception being the 1983 election. In the 2001 election, the booth at East Hamersley Primary School was only won by the Liberal Party with a 0.3% two-party-preferred majority.

5000|$|A leading {{theory that}} {{attempts}} to explain the lack of political engagement within disabled communities deals primarily with access to <b>polling</b> <b>places.</b> In fact, many <b>polling</b> <b>places</b> {{are considered to be}} nearly entirely inaccessible to persons with disabilities.

25|$|This {{confusion}} {{results in}} a ballot for one <b>polling</b> <b>place</b> being deposited in the ballot box corresponding to an officially different <b>polling</b> <b>place,</b> giving both an undervote for the correct <b>polling</b> <b>place</b> and an overvote for the incorrect one. According to the COFIPE (Federal Code of Electoral Institutions and Procedures), article 231 a ballot which {{is placed in the}} wrong box should be moved to the correct box if possible (as is the case, for example, if the presidential ballot is deposited in the senatorial ballot box), but should in any case be counted and reported. A single such vote would appear as both an undervote and an overvote in the analyses and reports mentioned above.|$|E
