50|$|Various {{initiatives}} are underway {{to improve the}} efficiency of computer <b>power</b> supplies. Climate <b>Savers</b> Computing Initiative promotes energy saving and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging {{development and use of}} more efficient power supplies. 80 PLUS certifies power supplies that meet certain efficiency criteria, and encourages their use via financial incentives. Efficient power supplies also save money by wasting less power; as a result they use less electricity to power the same computer, and they emit less waste heat which results significant energy savings on central air conditioning in the summer. The gains of using an efficient power supply are more substantial in computers that use a lot of power.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} study which {{describes}} the power consumption {{characteristics of a}} number of different interaction techniques on a desktop and laptop computer. In total, 8 interactions {{that can be used to}} carry out a single task (navigating a PDF document) were compared for power consumption across both a desktop and a laptop computer and across two different <b>power</b> <b>saver</b> settings. The results suggest that the power consumption of different interaction techniques for a single task vary significantly. Furthermore, the results suggest that a key factor in the power consumption of the interaction technique is the number of screen updates involved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Solar {{energy is}} one of the major {{renewable}} sources and is non polluted. Hence, the utilization of this energy is essential everywhere where the maximum possibility of utilization of solar energy is there. One of such possibility is solar power to street lights and traffic systems. Hence, an attempt is made to implement the solar <b>power</b> <b>saver</b> system for street lights and automatic traffic control unit. The proposed system is implemented with MAX 3032 Altera CPLD with 32 macro cells. An infrared sensor array is installed on the streets to know the presence of traffic. As there is a requirement of light only at night times, light detectors are used in the system to work it only in the absence of sun light when there is a presence of traffic. In this way the maximum power can be saved. Proposed cost effective system not only saves the power rather it reduces the usage of conventional energy. The proposed system logic is implemented using VHDL...|$|E

Research studies report different conclusions than the manufacturer of the BPS stating that the equipment requires more effort than a standard bike crank arm. Individuals with range of motion limitations also use the BPS because they cannot use a standard crank arm. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare available options for those with range of motion limitations to determine which allowed the most effective use of force. Subjects pedaled a stationary bicycle at a casual speed and cadence and at an accelerated speed and cadence using a fixed shortened crank arm, a hinged crank arm, and a standard crank arm on their dominant side with no contribution from their affected limb. A previous study of the BPS reports less effectiveness, but the study involved only able-bodied subjects with no physical limitations. The use of subjects that do not require the device may be a factor in this conclusion. Knowledge of functional characteristics of components when bike modifications are required would be invaluable in maximizing performance. This study provides invaluable data for consumers to choose which device maximizes force generation when pedaling a bicycle. W. Lee Childers, Géza F. Kogler, and Robert Kistenber...|$|E
