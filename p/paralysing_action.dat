40|$|By {{way of a}} {{discussion}} of the deliberately hard case of humanitarian intervention, this article considers the merits of an alternative cosmopolitan ethics to that of liberal cosmopolitanism, one which founds its universalism on an ethics of hospitality rather than the rights of man. Jacques Derrida describes the ethics of hospitality as defined by an unconditional welcome which nonetheless must become conditional in order to function. This leads to a profound paradox - an 'undecidability' - in the practice of the ethics of hospitality, the implications of which need to be better understood if the ambition of 'another cosmopolitanism' is to be realised. Interrogating the ethics of hospitality and the undecidability to which it gives rise in relation to humanitarian intervention, it is argued that responsibilities to others, which sometimes imply intervention, must always be kept in tension with openness to the coming of the Other, which limits intervention. Far from being blind or <b>paralysing</b> <b>action,</b> such 'bounded undecidability', it is suggested, actually defines the site of responsible, just decisions in humanitarian intervention.

40|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{action of}} chlorpromazine on skeletal muscle {{has been studied}} with isolated preparations. In the nerve-muscle preparations of the frog sartorius and the rat diaphragm, the twitch responses to indirect stimulation are much more strongly depressed by chlorpromazine than those to direct stimulation. The conductivity of the nerve trunk is unaffected. The contractures of the frog rectus abdominis muscle caused by acetylcholine are depressed by chlorpromazine,but the contractures due to KCl are not influenced. Larger doses of chlorpromazine cause contracture by themselves, and this cannot be prevented by tubocurarine. In the sartorius muscle of the toad, the depolarization due to acetylcholine is reduced by chlorpromazine. The <b>paralysing</b> <b>action</b> of chlorpromazine adds to that of tubocurarine, and is antagonized to some extent by eserine or neostigmine. Muscles treated with chlorpromazine do not completely recover on washing. High concentrations of chlorpromazine depress the release of acetylcholine by motor-nerve stimulation, although they do not affect the enzymic synthesis of acetylcholine by acetone-dried powder of guinea-pig brain. The differences between the neuromuscular block produced by chlorpromazine and that by tubocurarine are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Strychnin and {{adrenalin}} when {{injected into}} cardiectomized frogs are efficiently distributed {{all over the}} animal body and when administered in sufficient quantities produce the usual reactions of these alkaloids. The experiments with strychnin prove positively that the paralysing effect of this poison is due to its direct action upon the nerve cells of the cord, and not, as Verworn assumes, to a <b>paralysing</b> <b>action</b> upon the heart. When morphin is injected into cardiectomized frogs the effects are much greater and incomparably more rapid than when administered to a normal frog. The normal circulation probably contains substances derived from some organs capable of modifying and retarding the specific effects of morphin. The distribution of solutions in animals deprived of their circulatory apparatus takes place through the tissue spaces, which present {{a more or less}} well connected system of communications throughout the entire animal body, especially through its peripheral parts. This mode of distribution is designated as the peripheral mechanism. In contrast to the centralizing cardiovascular apparatus, the peripheral mechanism permits a greater autonomous action of organs and a more localising effect of injections. The peripheral mechanism found to be active in animals deprived of their circulation is probably identical with the mechanism which serves for distribution of the mesolymph in living animals not yet possessing a circulatory apparatus. The existence of the peripheral mechanism in animals with a cardiovascular apparatus possesses probably a phylogenetic significance. It is assumed that the activity of the peripheral mechanism is probably not completely suppressed even {{in the presence of a}} normally acting circulatory apparatus; that it exerts a greater physiological influence in parts in which the circulation is normally some-what difficult; and that it unfolds an activity in pathological conditions in which the circulation has been eliminated or reduced in some parts of the body, or in which the energy of the entire circulation has been reduced...|$|E

They were part of a campaign by Veterans for Peace UK to raise the British military age of recruitment from 16 to 18, in line with other European and Nato countries.|$|R
5000|$|As Germany {{attacked}} the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, {{a state of}} war was declared in the western regions of the country and in the annexed Baltic states. Vladimir Tributs the Commander-in-Chief of the Baltic Fleet of the Soviet Union issued an order on 24 June 1941 warning of the <b>paralysing</b> <b>actions</b> of enemy paratrooper squads aided by the [...] "capitalist-kulak" [...] portions of the populations, which allegedly had a large number of weapons that had not been turned in. The officers ordered the strengthening of defences of headquarters, army units and communications. Attacking [...] "bandits" [...] were to be shot on the spot. The struggle against saboteurs was the responsibility of the border guard units subordinate to the NKVD (People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs of the Soviet Union).|$|R

50|$|Those who {{are able}} to read the history in the light of what {{occurred}} later may perhaps be convinced that no policy whatever initiated, after 1766 could have prevented or even materially delayed the United States Declaration of Independence; but to the politicians of that time the coming event had not yet cast so dark a shadow before as to <b>paralyse</b> all <b>action,</b> and if any man could have allayed the growing discontent of the colonists and prevented the ultimate dismemberment of the empire, it would have been Lord Chatham.|$|R
60|$|The English colonists were greatly {{superior}} to the French in number; but they laboured under the disadvantage that the colonies were wholly independent of each other, with strong mutual jealousies, which <b>paralysed</b> their <b>action</b> and prevented their embarking upon any concerted operations. Upon the other hand, Canada was governed by the French as a military colony. The governor was practically absolute, and every man capable of bearing arms could, if necessary, be called by him into the field. He had at his disposal not only {{the wealth of the}} colony, but large assistance from France, and the French agents were, therefore, able to outbid the agents of the British colonies with the Indians.|$|R
60|$|A {{strange and}} mysterious {{thing is the}} working of terror on the human mind. Some it renders {{incapable}} of thought or <b>action,</b> <b>paralysing</b> their limbs and stagnating the blood in their veins; such creatures die in anticipating death. Others under the stress of that grim passion have their wits preternaturally sharpened. The instinct of self-preservation assumes command of all their senses, and urges them to swift and feverish action.|$|R
60|$|The Earl of Leicester shortly {{afterwards}} resigned {{his appointment}} as {{general of the}} army. He had got on but badly with the States General, and there was from the first no cordial cooperation between the two armies. The force at his disposal was never strong enough to do anything against the vastly superior armies of the Duke of Parma, {{who was one of}} the most brilliant generals of his age, while he was hampered and thwarted by the intrigues and duplicity of Elizabeth, who was constantly engaged in half hearted negotiations now with France and now with Spain, and whose capricious temper was continually overthrowing the best laid plans of her councillors and <b>paralysing</b> the <b>actions</b> of her commanders. It was nor until she saw her kingdom threatened by invasion that she placed herself fairly at the head of the national movement, and inspired her subjects with her energy and determination.|$|R

It may be God's pleasure that I should outlive this war; but as, with His will, I am determined that I will never lay down my sword till the soldiers of the Republic are driven from the province, it is most improbable that I should do so. You must teach yourself, Victorine, to look for my death, as an event certain to occur, which any day may bring forth; and when the heavy news is brought to you, bear it as a Christian woman should bear the afflictions of this, world. I do not ask you not to weep for me, for that would be putting too violent a constraint upon your nature, but do not weep over much. Above all, Victorine, do not allow your sorrow to <b>paralyse</b> your <b>actions.</b> You will have to act then, not only for yourself, but for your child--for my daughter; and if you then {{give way to the}} violence of sorrow, who shall think and care for her?" ...|$|R

He spent two days with Novisko. From there he went to Sofia. He was heard of in Athens and Constantinople. My own agent wrote me that he was in Belgrade. Hunterleys is the bosom friend of the English Foreign Secretary. That I know for myself. You have your reports. You can read between the lines. I tell you that Hunterleys is the man who has <b>paralysed</b> our <b>action</b> amongst the Balkan States. He has played a neat little game out there. It is he who was the inspiration of Roumania. It is he who drafted the secret understanding with Turkey. The war which we hoped for will not take place. From there Hunterleys came in a gunboat and landed on the Italian coast. He lingered at Bordighera for appearances only. He is here, if he can, to break up our conference. I tell you that you none of you appreciate this man.

40|$|In the {{extremely}} antipolitical {{time of the}} turbo-capitalistic way of shaping society, which cosiders that profit {{is more important than}} people – and animals, nature, social relations … actually anything – it became obvious that rethinking new concepts of democracy, representation and identitarianism or communitarism, which are presented to us as self-evident, unchangeable/eternal and final and which not only camouflage that catastrophic situation but also actively support and reproduce it – is needed. What that concept with all its attributes really produces, encourages and preserves is the fear of equality, which <b>paralyses</b> each emancipatory <b>action.</b> The article aims to rethink the possibility of emancipatory politics and consequently to open up the question of alternative ways of shaping society, to be based on solidarity, justice and equality of everyone, and not based on profit, competition and exploitation. To achieve that, the text examines the ways and possibilities of resistance and considers the aims of the protagonists and the places of this resistance as key political issues of our time...|$|R
6000|$|What a fair land! I {{never before}} grasped {{the charm of}} French colouring; the pinkish-yellow of the pan-tiled roofs, the lavender-grey or dim green of the shutters, the self-respecting shapes and {{flatness}} of the houses, unworried by wriggling ornamentation or lines coming up in order that they may go down again; the universal plane trees with their variegated trunks and dancing lightness--nothing more charming than plane trees in winter, their delicate twigs and little brown balls shaking against the clear pale skies, and in summer nothing more green and beautiful than their sun-flecked shade. Each country has its special genius of colouring--best displayed in winter. To characterise such genius by {{a word or two}} is hopeless; but one might say the genius of Spain is brown; of Ireland green; of England chalky blue-green; of Egypt shimmering sandstone. For France amethystine feebly expresses the sensation; the blend is subtle, stimulating, rarefied--at all events in the centre and south. Walk into an English village, however beautiful--and many are very beautiful--you will not get the peculiar sharp spiritual sensation which will come on you entering some little French village or town--the sensation one has looking at a picture by Francesca. The blue wood-smoke, the pinkish tiles, the grey shutters, the grey-brown plane trees, the pale blue sky, the yellowish houses, and above all the clean forms and the clear air. I shall never forget one late afternoon rushing home in the car from some commission. The setting sun had just broken through after a misty day, the mountains were illumined with purple and rose-madder, and snow-tipped against the blue sky, a wonderful wistaria blue drifted smoke-like about the valley; and the tall trees--poplars and cypresses--stood like spires. No wonder the French are spirituel, a word so different from our [...] "spiritual," [...] for that they are not; pre-eminently citizens of this world--even the pious French. This is why on the whole they make a better fist of social life than we do, we misty islanders, only half-alive because we set such store by our unrealised moralities. Not one Englishman in ten now really believes {{that he is going to}} live again, but his disbelief has not yet reconciled him to making the best of this life, or laid ghosts of the beliefs he has outworn. Clear air and sun, but not so much as to <b>paralyse</b> <b>action,</b> have made in France clearer eyes, clearer brains, and touched souls with a sane cynicism. The French do not despise and neglect the means to ends. They face sexual realities. They know that to live well they must eat well, to eat well must cook well, to cook well must cleanly and cleverly cultivate their soil. May France be warned in time by our dismal fate! May she never lose her love of the land; nor let industrialism absorb her peasantry, and the lure of wealth and the cheap glamour of the towns draw her into their uncharmed circles. We English have rattled deep into a paradise of machines, chimneys, cinemas, and halfpenny papers; have bartered our heritage of health, dignity, and looks for wealth, and badly distributed wealth at that. France was trembling on the verge of the same precipice when the war came; with its death and wind of restlessness the war bids fair to tip her over. Let her hold back with all her might! Her two dangers are drink and the lure of the big towns. No race can preserve sanity and refinement which really gives way to these. She will not fare even as well as we have if she yields; our fibre is coarser and more resistant than hers, nor had we ever so much grace to lose. It is by grace and self-respect that France had her pre-eminence; let these wither, as wither they must in the grip of a sordid and drink-soothed industrialism, and her star will burn out. The life of the peasant is hard; peasants are soon wrinkled and weathered; they are not angels; narrow and over-provident, suspicious, and given to drink, they still have their roots and being in the realities of life, close to nature, and keep a sort of simple dignity and health which great towns destroy. Let France take care of her peasants and her country will take care of itself.|$|R
5000|$|Politically, {{however, the}} {{situation}} was tense as the reforms inaugurated during the preceding reign did not answer expectations. Within {{three years of the}} introduction of the new electoral laws Louis De Geer ministry had forfeited much of its former popularity, and had been forced to resign. In the vital matter of national defence no common understanding had been arrived at, and during the conflicts which had raged round this question, the two chambers had come into frequent collision and <b>paralysed</b> the <b>action</b> of the government. The peasant proprietors, who, under the name of the [...] "Lantmanna" [...] party, formed a compact majority in the Second Chamber, pursued a consistent policy of class interests in the matter of the taxes and burdens that had, as they urged, so long oppressed the Swedish peasantry; and consequently when a bill was introduced for superseding the old system of army organization by general compulsory service, they demanded as a condition of its acceptance that the military burdens should be more evenly distributed in the country, and that the taxes, which they regarded as a burden under which they had wrongfully groaned for centuries, should be abolished. In these circumstances, the [...] "Lantmanna" [...] party in the Riksdag, who desired the lightening of the military burden, joined those who desired the abolition of landlordism, and formed a compact and predominant majority in the Second Chamber, while the burgher and Liberal parties were reduced to an impotent [...] "intelligence" [...] minority. This majority in the Lower Chamber was at once attacked by another compact majority in the Upper, who on their side maintained that the hated land taxes were only a kind of rent-charge on land, were incidental to it and in no way weighed upon the owners, and moreover that its abolition would be quite unwarrantable, as {{it was one of the}} surest sources of revenue to the state. On the other hand, the First Chamber refused to listen to any abolition of the old military system, so long as the defence of the country had not been placed upon a secure basis by the adoption of general compulsory military service. The government stood midway between these conflicting majorities in the chambers, without support in either.|$|R
