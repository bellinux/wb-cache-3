500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Dark Knight, Eckhart next {{appeared}} in Alan Ball's Towelhead (2008), an adaption of the Alicia Erian novel of the same name, in which he played a Gulf War Army reservist who sexually abuses his 13-year-old Arab-American neighbor. The film was screened under the name Nothing is Private at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. When he was first approached for the role, Eckhart revealed {{that he did not}} want to play a [...] "pedophile". When asked about the sex scenes, Eckhart said: [...] "Those were difficult times.... The way I did it was to really trust Alan. It was in the words. I really trusted Summer , and I tried to get her to trust me, to build a relationship when we were doing physical scenes. We'd really rehearse them mechanically, and I'd say, 'OK, I'm going to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> here, I'm going to do this.'... I think I found it more difficult." [...] Towelhead was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|Defeated at Richmond, Mason {{returned}} to Gunston Hall, where he devoted himself {{to family and}} local affairs, though still keeping up a vigorous correspondence with political leaders. He resigned from the Fairfax County Court after an act passed by the new Congress required officeholders {{to take an oath}} to support the constitution, and in 1790 declined a seat in the Senate which had been left vacant by William Grayson's death, stating that his health would not permit him to serve, even if he had no other objection. The seat went to James Monroe, who had supported Mason's Anti-Federalist stance, and who had, in 1789, lost to Madison for a seat in the House of Representatives. Judging by his correspondence, Mason softened his stance towards the new federal government, telling Monroe that the constitution [...] "wisely & Properly directs" [...] that ambassadors be confirmed by the Senate. Although Mason predicted that the amendments to be proposed to the states by the First Congress would be [...] "Milk & Water Propositions", he displayed [...] "much Satisfaction" [...] at what became the Bill of Rights (ratified in 1791) and wrote that if his concerns about the federal courts and other matters were addressed, [...] "I could cheerfully <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>Hand</b> & Heart to the new Government".|$|E
500|$|Peter Doyle may be {{the most}} likely {{candidate}} for the love of Whitman's life. Doyle was a bus conductor whom Whitman met around 1866, and the two were inseparable for several years. Interviewed in 1895, Doyle said: [...] "We were familiar at once—I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> on his knee—we understood. He did not get {{out at the end of}} the trip—in fact went all the way back with me." [...] In his notebooks, Whitman disguised Doyle's initials using the code [...] "16.4" [...] (P.D. being the 16th and 4th letters of the alphabet). Oscar Wilde met Whitman in America in 1882 and told the homosexual-rights activist George Cecil Ives that Whitman's sexual orientation was beyond question —"I have the kiss of Walt Whitman still on my lips." [...] The only explicit description of Whitman's sexual activities is secondhand. In 1924, Edward Carpenter told Gavin Arthur of a sexual encounter in his youth with Whitman, the details of which Arthur recorded in his journal. Late in his life, when Whitman was asked outright whether his [...] "Calamus" [...] poems were homosexual, he chose not to respond. The manuscript of his love poem [...] "Once I Pass'd Through A Populous City", written when Whitman was 29, indicates it was originally about a man.|$|E

2500|$|...The Lady made a {{sign for}} me to approach; but I was seized with fear, and I did not dare, {{thinking}} that I was faced with an illusion. I rubbed my eyes, but in vain. I looked again, and I could still see the same Lady. Then I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> into my pocket, and took my rosary. I {{wanted to make the}} sign of the cross, but in vain; I could not raise my hand to my forehead, it kept on dropping" ... "The Lady took the rosary that she held in her hands and she made the sign of the cross".|$|E
2500|$|Vandersloot {{became a}} {{basketball}} star at Kentwood High School in her hometown. Her coach, Keith Hennig, a former player at Central Washington University who is 6inches taller than Vandersloot, regularly played one-on-one against her either {{before or after}} the team's practice. He would later say, [...] "I did not take it easy on her at all. I was more physical than anything she's ever been used to. At times, I wasn't too nice. I would ride her and foul her. I'd <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> in her face and she would whine and complain about fouls. I'd say, 'There's no fouls out here.' [...] " [...] She eventually reached the point where she regularly beat her coach off the dribble.|$|E

2500|$|During a September 2016 {{appearance}} on the radio show El Show de Piolín, Fox smashed a Trump piñata hanging {{on the streets of}} Los Angeles while loudly singing the traditional Piñata song. Upon breaking it open, Fox noted its lack of contents and remarked, [...] "Empty. Totally Empty. He doesn't have any brains." [...] Discussing the event during a subsequent interview with GQ, Fox expanded, [...] "I had such a joy in my heart by doing that, because in Mexico, piñatas are very meaningful. Piñatas are a celebration. Piñatas let you send messages. And the message is: Trump is empty inside. He's empty in his head. That's why I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> into his head. There was no brain there. That's what he is, an empty person." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the local}} {{publication}} City Pages description of the BCA conversation, Yanez [...] "could never state definitively ... that he saw a firearm that day". Yanez uses [...] "various terms to suggest {{the presence of a}} firearm". Yanez states, [...] "it appeared to me that he was wrapping something around his fingers and almost like if I were to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> around my gun. It was dark inside the vehicle ..." [...] At another point [...] "it seemed like he was pulling out a gun and the barrel just kept coming." [...] "I know he had an object and it was dark. And he was pulling it out with his right hand."He added: [...] "It was, to me, it just looked big and apparent that he's gonna shoot you, he's gonna kill you." ...|$|E
2500|$|McGreavy {{was arrested}} by police at 3:50 am, {{walking on a street}} near the Ralphs' home. Upon his arrest, McGreavy {{reportedly}} said, [...] "What's this all about?" [...] At first, McGreavy denied any responsibility, but, several hours later said, [...] "It was me, but, it wasn’t me," [...] after which he described in graphic detail what he had done. He told police, [...] "I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> over her (Samantha's) mouth, and it went from there. It's all in the house. On Paul, I used a wire. I was going to bury him, but I couldn't. I went outside, {{and put them on the}} fence. All I could hear is kids, kids, kids." [...] McGreavy's only explanation for the murders was that the baby would not stop crying.|$|E

2500|$|The Better Boston Group is a {{political}} group that split from the Boston Bypass Independents in October 2007 under the leadership Cllr Anne Dorrian. She had unsuccessfully stood for leadership of the BBI group after their landslide victory in April 2007. It has four councillors on Boston Borough Council. Cllr Brian Rush, the other unsuccessful candidate for Party leadership in April 2007, of the group said of the Boston Bypass Independents that [...] "We came in on a typhoon and we {{are nothing more than}} a gentle breeze now. It appears to me that we haven't done anything yet. There is nothing that I can <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> on and say the BBI have thought of that, the inspiration was there and they have carried it through." [...] The group criticised the record of the BBI, including their approval of the Lincolnshire County Council Transport Strategy for Boston. A deal with the county council was struck to aid the BBI with the bypass proposal if they agreed not to stand in the next county council elections, prompting two councillors to resign. The chairman of the Boston Bypass Pressure Group also called on Cllr Austin and his deputy, Cllr Peter Jordan to resign over the deal with Lincolnshire Council. Both Cllrs Austin and Jordan vigorously denied any such deal and there were four BBI candidates in the subsequent County Council elections in 2009.|$|E

60|$|At this I shipped my oars, {{and began}} to examine the boat.

The {{flooring}} was in sections, and lifting the one beneath me, I felt under it, and <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> into six or eight inches of water.|$|E
