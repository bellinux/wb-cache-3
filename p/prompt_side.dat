2500|$|Around 11:20pm, while {{preparations}} for the final act were under way, stage manager J. W. Thorpe saw a small flame on the left, or <b>prompt</b> <b>side</b> of the stage. The fire {{was coming from the}} lower part of a drop hanging below the rigging loft near the center stage border-light. The canvas was hanging, partially detached, from its frame and, Thorpe thought, somehow must have slipped past the wire mesh guard of the border lamp and ignited. He estimated its size to be no larger than his hand. Though water in paint buckets was once kept on hand on the stage and in the rigging loft and though a two and a half inch (...) water pipe still serviced a fire hose backstage, none of these facilities was readily available. Thorpe considered the fire hose, but there was much scenery in the way. He decided that the fire would be well under way by the time the hose was in place. He opted to extinguish the flame by whatever means were readily available. He directed carpenters Hamilton Weaver and William Van Sicken to extinguish the flame. They attempted this by beating the fire with long stage poles.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not very}} light, but Nicholas found himself close to the first {{entrance}} on the <b>prompt</b> <b>side,</b> among bare walls, dusty scenes, mildewed clouds, heavily daubed draperies, and dirty floors. He looked about him; ceiling, pit, boxes, gallery, orchestra, fittings, and decorations of every kind,--all looked coarse, cold, gloomy, and wretched.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{momentary}} pause, {{and then from}} the wings on the <b>prompt</b> <b>side</b> there shambled out a stout and shrinking figure, in whose hand was a script of the play and on whose face, lit up by the footlights, there shone a look of apprehension. It was Fillmore, the Man of Destiny.|$|E

5000|$|At Rennes, Majid Musisi was {{a regular}} {{presence}} and scored a number of crucial goals, which <b>prompted</b> Turkish <b>side</b> Bursaspor to sign him in 1997 for a reported $1m. He later moved to Dardanelspor, another Turkish club before he brought the curtain down on his professional career in 2001. [...] "Dardanelspor still owes him money", says Nantongo, without disclosing the amount.|$|R
6000|$|Sir Chester Portwood, {{ploughing}} his {{way through}} a long speech, stopped and looked apprehensively over his shoulder. The girl with the lisp, who had been listening in a perfunctory manner to the long speech, screamed loudly. The voice of an unseen stage-hand called thunderously to an invisible [...] "Bill" [...] to commere quick. And from the scenery on the <b>prompt</b> <b>side</b> there curled lazily across the stage a black wisp of smoke.|$|E
60|$|Lady Malvern was a hearty, happy, healthy, overpowering sort of dashed female, not so {{very tall}} but making up for it by {{measuring}} about six feet from the O.P. to the <b>Prompt</b> <b>Side.</b> She fitted into my biggest arm-chair {{as if it had}} been built round her by someone who knew they were wearing arm-chairs tight about the hips that season. She had bright, bulging eyes and a lot of yellow hair, and when she spoke she showed about fifty-seven front teeth. She was one of those women who kind of numb a fellow's faculties. She made me feel as if I were ten years old and had been brought into the drawing-room in my Sunday clothes to say how-d'you-do. Altogether by no means the sort of thing a chappie would wish to find in his sitting-room before breakfast.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo!" [...] said Wally cheerfully. [...] "Going strong? How's {{everybody}} at home? Fine? So am I! By the way, am I wrong or did I hear {{something about a}} theatrical entertainment of some sort here to-night?" [...] He looked about him at the empty stage. In the wings, on the <b>prompt</b> <b>side,</b> could be discerned the flannel-clad forms of the gentlemanly members of the male ensemble, all dressed up for Mrs. Stuyvesant van Dyke's tennis party. One {{or two of the}} principals were standing perplexedly in the lower entrance. The O.P. side had been given over by general consent to Mr. Goble for his perambulations. Every now and then he would flash into view through an opening in the scenery. [...] "I understood that to-night was the night for the great revival of comic opera. Where are the comics, and why aren't they opping?" ...|$|E

6000|$|But the two-sworded man was {{far more}} miserable than I. The bad Thunder Cat cast such spells upon him that I {{gave up trying to}} find out what he meant to be. He was a fat-faced low comedian King of the Rats, {{assisted}} by other rats, and he ate a magic radish with side-splitting pantomime till he became a man once more. Then all his bones were taken away,--still by the Thunder Cat,--and he fell into a horrid heap, illuminated by the small boy with the candle--and would not recover himself till somebody spoke to a magic parrot, and a huge hairy villain and several coolies had walked over him. Then he was a girl, but, hiding behind a parasol, resumed his shape, and then the curtain came down and the audience ran about the stage and circulated generally. One small boy took it into his head that he could turn head-over-heels from the <b>Prompt</b> <b>side</b> across. With great gravity, before the unregarding house, he set to work; but rolled over sideways with a flourish of chubby legs. Nobody cared, and the polite people in the gallery could not understand why the Professor and I were helpless with laughter when the child, with a clog for a sword, imitated the strut of the two-sworded man. The actors changed in public, and any one who liked might help shift scenes. Why should not a baby enjoy himself if he liked? ...|$|E
6000|$|In a {{piece at}} the Ambigu, called the [...] "Rentrée à Paris," [...] a mere scene {{in honour of}} {{the return of the}} troops from the Crimea the other day, there is a novelty which I think it worth letting you know of, as it is easily available, either for a serious or a comic interest--the {{introduction}} of a supposed electric telegraph. The scene is the railway terminus at Paris, with the electric telegraph office on the <b>prompt</b> <b>side,</b> and the clerks with their backs to the audience--much more real than if they were, as they infallibly would be, staring about the house--working the needles; and the little bell perpetually ringing. There are assembled to greet the soldiers, all the easily and naturally imagined elements of interest--old veteran fathers, young children, agonised mothers, sisters and brothers, girl lovers--each impatient to know {{of his or her own}} object of solicitude. Enter to these a certain marquis, full of sympathy for all, who says: [...] "My friends, I am one of you. My brother has no commission yet. He is a common soldier. I wait for him as well as all brothers and sisters here wait for their brothers. Tell me whom you are expecting." [...] Then they all tell him. Then he goes into the telegraph-office, and sends a message down the line to know how long the troops will be. Bell rings. Answer handed out on slip of paper. [...] "Delay on the line. Troops will not arrive for a quarter of an hour." [...] General disappointment. [...] "But we have this brave electric telegraph, my friends," [...] says the marquis. [...] "Give me your little messages, and I'll send them off." [...] General rush round the marquis. Exclamations: [...] "How's Henri?" [...] "My love to Georges;" [...] "Has Guillaume forgotten Elise?" [...] "Is my son wounded?" [...] "Is my brother promoted?" [...] etc. etc. Marquis composes tumult. Sends message--such a regiment, such a company--"Elise's love to Georges." [...] Little bell rings, slip of paper handed out--"Georges in ten minutes will embrace his Elise. Sends her a thousand kisses." [...] Marquis sends message--such a regiment, such a company--"Is my son wounded?" [...] Little bell rings. Slip of paper handed out--"No. He has not yet upon him those marks of bravery in the glorious service of his country which his dear old father bears" [...] (father being lamed and invalided). Last of all, the widowed mother. Marquis sends message--such a regiment, such a company--"Is my only son safe?" [...] Little bell rings. Slip of paper handed out--"He was first upon the heights of Alma." [...] General cheer. Bell rings again, another slip of paper handed out. [...] "He was made a sergeant at Inkermann." [...] Another cheer. Bell rings again, another slip of paper handed out. [...] "He was made colour-sergeant at Sebastopol." [...] Another cheer. Bell rings again, another slip of paper handed out. [...] "He was the first man who leaped with the French banner on the Malakhoff tower." [...] Tremendous cheer. Bell rings again, another slip of paper handed out. [...] "But he was struck down there by a musket-ball, and----Troops have proceeded. Will arrive in half a minute after this." [...] Mother abandons all hope; general commiseration; troops rush in, down a platform; son only wounded, and embraces her.|$|E
