5|$|Many other {{endemic species}} of Mauritius and Réunion were lost after {{the arrival of}} humans, so that the {{ecosystems}} of these islands are severely damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, the islands were entirely covered in forests, very little of which remains today, because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. On Mauritius, the Mascarene grey parakeet lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the dodo, the red rail, the broad-billed parrot, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the Mauritius night heron.

40|$|With disease {{playing an}} often unknown role in populations of {{endangered}} species, necropsy studies {{are an important}} component of conservation management programmes. In the present study, we investigate causes of mortality in the free-living population of endangered <b>pink</b> <b>pigeons</b> Columba mayeri, endemic to Mauritius. Fifty carcasses of free-living <b>pink</b> <b>pigeons</b> were found over a 5 yr period between January 2002 and December 2006. Causes of mortality and other post-mortem findings are reported for 43 of these birds, which were aged between 6 wk and 15 yr. The protozoan disease trichomonosis was {{the most common cause of}} death, with 22 (52 %) freshly dead birds identified as dying from this disease. Four birds were suspected to have been killed by introduced mammalian predators, 4 died as the result of an impact injury and most of the remaining birds either died of unknown causes or the carcasses were too decomposed for necropsy. Our study highlights trichomonad protozoal infections as an important mortality factor in post-fledging <b>pink</b> <b>pigeons</b> in recent years. A number of other novel or rarely described parasites are also identified, highlighting the relative paucity of knowledge on background levels of parasitism in free-living endangered species...|$|R
50|$|Because {{the pink}} pigeon's natural habitat has become degraded, natural food sources {{have in the}} past been deemed {{insufficient}} to sustain the wild population or allow successful breeding and chick-rearing. The MWF and other organizations are providing supplemental feeding stations that offer diet items like whole wheat. To prevent other bird species from plundering this feed, special feeding platforms have been designed that allow access primarily to <b>pink</b> <b>pigeons</b> only.|$|R

40|$|Avian trichomonosis {{is known}} as a {{widespread}} disease in columbids and passerines, and recent findings have highlighted the pathogenic character of some lineages found in wild birds. Trichomonosis can affect wild bird populations including endangered species, as has been shown for Mauritian <b>pink</b> <b>pigeons</b> Nesoenas mayeri in Mauritius and suggested for European turtle doves Streptopelia turtur in the UK. However, the disease trichomonosis is caused only by pathogenic lineages of the parasite Trichomonas gallinae. Therefore, understanding the prevalence and distribution of both potentially pathogenic and non-pathogenic T. gallinae lineages in turtle doves and other columbids across Europe is relevant to estimate the potential impact of the disease on a continental scale...|$|R

5000|$|The Réunion <b>pink</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Nesoenas duboisi, but see below) is an {{extinct species}} of pigeon that {{formerly}} {{lived on the}} Mascarene island of Réunion. It is known from the description of a rusty-red pigeon given by Dubois in 1674 and a single subfossil humerus that agrees {{with that of the}} <b>pink</b> <b>pigeon</b> of Mauritius in generic characteristics, except being slightly longer. Also, Dubois' reference to the bill being red at the base and the eyes being surrounded by a red ring suggest that this species was closely allied to the Mauritus taxon. Dubois' description was as follows: wild pigeons, everywhere full with them, some with slaty-coloured feathering Alectroenas?, the others russet-red N. duboisi. They are a little larger than the European pigeons, and have larger bills, red at the end close to the head, the eyes ringed with the colour of fire, like pheasants. There is a season when they are so fat that one can no longer see their cloaca croupion. They are very good tasting. Wood-pigeons and turtle-doves, as one sees in Europe and as good. [...] Its genus Nesoenas was often synonymized with Columba in the past, but more recently it has been synonymized with Streptopelia. As the <b>pink</b> <b>pigeon</b> and the Madagascar turtle dove cannot be firmly placed in either of these two genera but apparently represent a distinct lineage that diverged early, probably from the ancestor of Streptopelia, it seems (at least for the time being) to be best to separate them again in Nesoenas. This restores the genus of the Réunion <b>pink</b> <b>pigeon</b> to the one it was originally described under.|$|E
50|$|The {{accuracy}} of the ARKS and MedARKS systems relies on animals being correctly identified. While it may be easy to identify the male gorilla Ya Kwanza within his family, identifying individual <b>pink</b> <b>pigeons</b> or poison arrow frogs is more difficult. An ID transponder or microchip, {{the size of a}} grain of rice, is placed under the skin by injection. It emits a ten digit alpha numeric code which is recognised by a scanning device. This also enables the Trust's Research Department to identify animals during studies. Most research involves the observation of animals, without disturbing them, and includes studies on general behaviour, on feeding and on parental care of offspring either in the Trust grounds or overseas.|$|R

25|$|World of Birds, which {{originally}} {{opened in}} 1972, is an indoor bird house spanning two floors and featuring several walk-through aviaries. The building closed for repairs and upgrades {{in the summer}} of 2010, and reopened the following year. The exhibit has multiple educational displays focusing on deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade and their affects on wild bird populations. The most prominent residents of the exhibit include the maleos, a pair of Sanford's tarictic hornbills (Penelopides exarhatus sanfordi), green junglefowl, fawn-breasted bowerbirds, Cuban amazons, <b>pink</b> <b>pigeons,</b> Andean cocks-of-the-rock, plate-billed mountain toucans, Oriental pied hornbills, Abdim's storks, keas, three species of birds-of-paradise, a golden-headed quetzal, blue-billed curassows, white-throated bee-eaters, western capercaillies, white-fronted bee-eaters and common hoopoes. Emus can be found in an outdoor yard. Golden lion tamarins, Bolivian grey titis, cotton-top tamarins, and red-footed tortoise make up the exhibit's non-bird species. In mid-2009, the zoo's hand-reared pair of great blue turacos successfully raised chicks, the first known instance of a hand-reared pair doing so. In March 2013, three maleo chicks hatched at the zoo, bringing their total number of birds to 12. The zoo, along with the WCS, works towards preserving this species in the wild as well.|$|R
50|$|Nesoenas is a bird genus in {{the pigeon}} and dove family, Columbidae. It is often {{included}} with the typical turtle-doves in Streptopelia or the typical pigeons (Columba). By those who accepted it, it was usually treated as monotypic, containing only the <b>pink</b> <b>pigeon</b> (N. mayeri) of Mauritius.|$|E
50|$|As of 2016, {{there are}} five {{locations}} places where wild populations of the <b>pink</b> <b>pigeon</b> can be found. Four of these locations belong to Black River Gorges National Park and the fifth to Isle aux Aigrettes. All are monitored by the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation. The species is not migratory.|$|E
50|$|Other {{endangered}} animals {{include the}} aye-aye, Alaotran gentle lemur, free-ranging black lion tamarin, pied tamarin and silvery marmoset, Andean bear, maned wolf, narrow-striped mongoose, Mauritius <b>pink</b> <b>pigeon,</b> Mauritius kestrel, Saint Lucia amazon, Bali starling, Meller's duck, Madagascar teal (Bernier's teal), Round Island boa, Lesser Antillean iguana and Mallorcan midwife toad.|$|E
50|$|Despite being {{widely used}} as a dewormer in many species, {{toxicity}} has been reported. Birds (storks, <b>pink</b> pelicans, vultures, <b>pigeons</b> and doves) and reptiles (vipers, turtles and tortoises) have shown toxicity associated with bone marrow suppression, intestinal crypt cell necrosis and distal villi sloughing. Abortions in domestic ruminants {{have been associated with}} concurrent use of anti-trematode therapeutic agents.|$|R
5000|$|The yellow-eyed pigeon is a {{medium-sized}} pigeon growing to {{a length of}} about 30 cm and a weight of 183 to 234 g. It is mostly grey, with a slightly brownish tinge to the upper parts and a pinkish-purple sheen on the crown, throat and breast. The wing has a black bar and the tail has a diffuse dark band. The lower back, rump and underside of the wings are white or pale grey. There is bare area of yellowish skin around the eye, the iris is yellow, the beak is yellowish and the feet <b>pink.</b> This <b>pigeon</b> could {{be confused with the}} rock dove (C. livia), but that species has more prominent wing bars and tail band. The hill pigeon (C. rupestris) is also similar, but it has a white subterminal band on the tail above the black terminal band. The yellow-eyed pigeon is generally a silent bird, but during the breeding season it sometimes emits a faint [...] "oo-oo-oo".|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} endemic to the Mascarene island of Mauritius, {{a small island}} {{to the east of}} Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, and the tiny predator-free island of Isle aux Aigrettes off its east coast. A related subspecies, the Réunion <b>pink</b> <b>pigeon,</b> became extinct on the {{neighboring}} Reunion Island around 1700.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pink</b> <b>pigeon</b> is herbivorous, {{feeding on}} both exotic and native plants - {{consuming}} buds, flowers, leaves, shoots, fruits and seeds. These birds exhibit ground-feeding behaviors, moving and turning over leaf litter {{in order to}} find food and grit (for use as gizzard stones). Non-native species like the Chinese Guava have an impact by preventing growth of native trees.|$|E
50|$|Further species {{restoration}} {{work was}} undertaken with the <b>pink</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Nesoenas mayeri), {{of which the}} population had declined to just 10 individuals by 1990. Population estimates of about 400 birds in seven subpopulations (six in the national park and one on Ile aux Aigrettes) in 2015 have resulted from Jones' leadership in the intervention, following similar methods to the Mauritius kestrel project.|$|E
50|$|The Free Range Aviary is home {{tropical}} forest dwelling birds such as <b>pink</b> <b>pigeon,</b> mountain peacock-pheasant, ringed teal, silver-eared mesia, scarlet-chested parrot, pheasant pigeon, Gouldian finch, sunbittern, common emerald dove, Victoria crowned pigeon, speckled mousebird, and mountain bamboo partridge. Within the aviary are some enclosed animal exhibits that {{are home to}} animals such as scarlet macaws and golden-headed lion tamarins.|$|E
50|$|Common predators {{include the}} crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis), the small Asian {{mongoose}} (Herpestes auropunctatus), rats, and feral cats. Invasive plant {{species such as}} the Chinese guava and privet dominate native forest plants, preventing their growth. Without these native plant species, the <b>Pink</b> <b>Pigeon</b> {{finds it hard to}} locate sound nesting locations or food sources. Extreme weather events such as cyclones may also further the degradation of habitat.|$|E
50|$|The Trust {{began working}} in Mauritius during the 1970s. In 1998 it {{announced}} that the Mauritius kestrel - a species once reduced to only four birds - had been saved from extinction. Durrell is also working to save critically endangered species such as the <b>pink</b> <b>pigeon,</b> echo parakeet, Round Island boa (Casarea dussumieri) and Mauritius fody. It has also helped in the restoration of Round Island - a small island about 12 miles north east of Mauritius.|$|E
5000|$|An adult <b>pink</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{is about}} 36-38 cm from beak to tail and 350 grams in weight. Pink pigeons have pale pinkish-grey plumage on their head, {{shoulders}} and underside, along with pink feet. The beak {{is a dark}} pink color with a white tip. They have dark brown wings, and a broad, rust-colored tail. Their eyes are dark brown surrounded by an eye-ring of red skin. Newly hatched pigeons have sparse, downy-white feathers and closed eyes.|$|E
50|$|Since the Réunion <b>pink</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{was only}} {{mentioned}} explicitly by Dubois, little {{can be said}} about its extinction. The last reports of native pigeons were by Père Bernardin in 1687 and by Guillaume Houssaye in 1689, although the Alectroenas may have existed for a somewhat longer time. Jean Feuilley in 1705 mentioned that all native pigeons were extinct; it seems likely that introduced rats and cats, combined with excessive hunting, were the causes of the birds' extinction.|$|E
50|$|The Mauritian Wildlife Appeal Fund was {{established}} in 1984 under the initiative of naturalist Gerald Durrell and the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust principally {{to raise funds for}} the conservation of endemic Mauritius wildlife. The conservation work in Mauritius began as a species orientated program concentrating on a few critically endangered species, including the Mauritius kestrel and the <b>pink</b> <b>pigeon.</b> The initiation of the conservation program in 1976 was popularized by Gerald Durrell in his book Golden Bats and Pink Pigeons.|$|E
50|$|Future {{projects}} in the valley will include the large-scale propagation and introduction of indigenous and endemic plants to degraded parts of the valley, together with continued weeding of invasive alien plants.There {{will also be a}} re-introduction of the endangered endemic birds <b>pink</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba mayeri) and echo parakeet (Psittacula echo). The giant tortoises, whose grazing action naturally assists in the regeneration of Mauritian forests, will also be released into the core conservation zone, to complete the re-establishment of the ecological balance of the forests.|$|E
50|$|Many other {{endemic species}} of Réunion became extinct after {{the arrival of}} man and the {{resulting}} disruption of the island's ecosystem. The Mascarene parrot lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the hoopoe starling, the Réunion ibis, the Réunion parakeet, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Réunion swamphen, the Réunion owl, the Réunion night heron, and the Réunion <b>pink</b> <b>pigeon.</b> Extinct Réunion reptiles include the Réunion giant tortoise and an undescribed Leiolopisma skink. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Réunion and Mauritius but vanished from both islands.|$|E
