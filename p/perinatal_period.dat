25|$|Breastfeeding {{research}} {{focuses on}} diverse aspects such as prevalence, HIV transmission, pharmacology, costs, benefits, immunology, contraindications, and comparisons to synthetic breast milk substitutes. Factors related to {{the mental health of}} the nursing mother in the <b>perinatal</b> <b>period</b> have been studied. While cognitive behavior therapy may be the treatment of choice, medications are sometimes used. The use of therapy rather than medication reduces the infant's exposure to medication that may be transmitted through the milk. In coordination with institutional organisms, researchers are also studying the social impact of brestfeeding throughout history. Accordingly, strategies have been developed to foster the increase of the breastfeedingrates in the different countries.|$|E

This qualitative study aimed to explore maternal experience of delivering bad news by caregiver in <b>perinatal</b> <b>periods.</b> Materials & Methods : This qualitative study were conducted in 2012 in Shahrekord, in –depth interviews with 38 mothers who had experienced a perinatal loss(abortion, miscarriage,in-utero death, still birth, or death of a newborn within the 28 day of life) within the last 2 years. The data was collected {{through the use of}} open interviews and analyzed by content analysis method. Results: The data analysis resulted in emerging 5 themes of maternal preferences for how to deliver bad news. Methods of communication, who disclose bad news, supporting, environmental and facilitating items were important factors for mothers during breaking bad news in prenatal periods. Conclusion: Results of this study showed some light on what is important to women who face bad news in <b>perinatal</b> <b>periods.</b> Although more researches are needed in this field.

The environmental enrichment, a powerful form of experience-dependent plasticity that allows high cognitive, motor and sensory stimulations, is helpful for recovering from different neurological pathologies. Thus, this study aimed at exploring the effects of environmental enrichment on alcohol vulnerability and affective behaviour in the offspring that was perinatally exposed to continuous or intermittent alcohol.

Pregnancy, {{delivery}} and postpartum period make the operation even more difficult as it is forced and complicated by various pathological conditions that develop over that time. Objective: The purpose of study was to analyze the frequency of hysterectomy, indications to undertake it and complications associated with {{the removal of the}} uterus in pregnancy and during <b>perinatal</b> and postpartum <b>period.</b> The study analyzed the cases of hysterectomies in <b>perinatal</b> and postpartum <b>period</b> performed over the 17 -year clinical material from the Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, SZOZ, Lipsko in the years 1985 – 2001. Material and methods : The material for analysis were medical records of 15 women who developed complications in pregnancy, <b>perinatal</b> and postpartum <b>period,</b> which were absolute indication to perform hysterectomy. The following parameters were analyzed: patient’s age, number of deliveries, the way pregnancies were terminated, the way present pregnancy was terminated, complications, indications to Caesarean section and perinatal and postpartum hysterectomy, type of hysterectomy performed, other associated procedures and complications. Results : In total 15 hysterectomies were performed in the period of study which accounts for 0. 10 % all deliveries. The material revealed the following causes for hysterectomy: placental pathologies (46. 7 %), inflammatory conditions of internal sex organs (20. 0 %), uterine atonia after delivery (13. 3 %), injuries of sex organs (13. 3 %). Elective hysterectomy in that period was performed in one patient (6. 7 %). The risk factors predisposing to complications resulting in hysterectomy were history of Caesarean sections in 10 patients (66. 7 %) and multiple spontaneous deliveries. Complications associated with hysterectomy which enforced additional operations were noted in two cases (13. 3 %). Total hysterectomy was performed in 8 patients (53. 3 %) including hysterectomy with adnexia in 3 women (20. 0 %). Amputation of the uterine body without adnexia was performed in 7 women (46. 7 %). No complications were noted after hysterectomies performed in the <b>perinatal</b> and postpartum <b>period.</b> Conclusions: Most common causes of hysterectomies during <b>perinatal</b> and postpartum <b>period</b> were placental pathology associated with massive loss of blood and uterine atonia after delivery.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: to {{describe}} hospital lethality rates and factors correlated {{to death in}} neonates with brain white matter lesions. METHODS: a retrospective study was performed from January 1994 to December 2001. Neonates with white brain matter lesions were divided into survival and death groups and their medical files reviewed through the single blind method to determine evolution. Death certificates provided the cause of death. The groups were compared through correlation coefficients. Hospital lethality rate was calculated. RESULTS: ninety three cases of white brain matter lesions and seven deaths were determined. Hospital lethality rate was of 8. 2. % (95 %CI: 2. 4 - 14. 0) independently from lesion occurrence time, and of 10. 3 % (95 %CI: 3. 3 - 17. 3) for deaths occurred during prenatal and <b>perinatal</b> <b>periods.</b> Death was correlated to: Apgar score, non-cephalic presentation, gestational age, hyperglicemia, hypercalcemia, convulsion, respiratory insufficiency and atelectasy. CONCLUSIONS: hospital lethality was of 10. 3 % generating the following hypothesis: perinatal asphyxia must be the principal direct and indirect etiologic factor (aggravating the expression of prematurity and infection diseases), of prenatal and perinatal mortality among newborns with white brain matter lesions; and < 7 Apgar score in the 5 th minute associated to brain white matter lesions, are markers for perinatal asphyxia diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Very {{low birth}} weight (VLBW) is a {{significant}} issue in St. Louis, Missouri. Our study evaluated risk factors associated with VLBW in this predominantly urban community. Methods. From 2000 to 2009, birth and fetal death certificates were evaluated (n= 160, 189), and mortality rates were calculated for <b>perinatal</b> <b>periods</b> of risk. The Kitagawa method was used to explore fetoinfant mortality rates (FIMR) in terms of birth weight distribution and birthweight specific mortality. Multivariable logistic regression {{was used to assess}} the magnitude of association of selected risk factors with VLBW. Results. VLBW contributes to 50 % of the excess FIMR in St. Louis City and County. The highest proportion of VLBW can be attributed to black maternal race (40. 6 %) in St. Louis City, inadequate prenatal care (19. 8 %), and gestational hypertension (12. 0 %) among black women. Medicaid was found to have a protective effect for VLBW among black women (population attributable risk (PAR) [*]=[*]− 14. 5). Discussion. Interventions targeting the health of women before and during conception may be most successful at reducing the disparities in VLBW in this population. Interventions geared towards smoking cessation and improvements in Medicaid and prenatal care access for black mothers and St. Louis City residents can greatly reduce VLBW rates...|$|R
40|$|Caitlin J Smith, Kelli K Ryckman Department of Epidemiology, University of Iowa, College of Public Health, Iowa City, IA, USA Abstract: Metabolic {{syndrome}} {{is a growing}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} worldwide. Metabolic {{syndrome is}} characterized by the presence of a variety of metabolic disturbances including obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and elevated fasting blood sugar. Although the risk for metabolic syndrome has largely been attributed to adult lifestyle factors such as poor nutrition, lack of exercise, and smoking, there is now strong evidence suggesting that predisposition to the development of metabolic syndrome begins in utero. First posited by Hales and Barker in 1992, the “thrifty phenotype” hypothesis proposes that susceptibility to adult chronic diseases can occur in response to exposures in the prenatal and <b>perinatal</b> <b>periods.</b> This hypothesis has been continually supported by epidemiologic studies and studies involving animal models. In this review, we describe the structural, metabolic and epigenetic changes that occur in response to adverse intrauterine environments including prenatal and postnatal diet, maternal obesity, and pregnancy complications. Given the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome in both the developed and developing worlds, a greater understanding and appreciation for the role of the intrauterine environment in adult chronic disease etiology is imperative.

40|$|International audienceNumerous data {{indicate}} that Rho kinase inhibitors, such as Fasudil, may constitute a novel therapy for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. We evaluated long-term effects of exposure to Fasudil during late gestation (10 mg/day) in male rat offspring from birth until 9 months. We also analyzed its effects in offspring from hypertensive mothers treated with a nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor (L-NAME; 50 mg/day). Prenatal exposure to Fasudil did not affect birth weight, but increased body weight from postnatal day 7 (P 7) to 9 months. In intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) fetuses exposed to L-NAME, maternal Fasudil treatment increased birth weight. At P 42 and P 180, rats exposed to Fasudil and L-NAME showed alterations of their food intake {{as well as an}} increased basal glycemia associated with mild glucose intolerance at 6 months which was also observed in Fasudil-exposed rats. In 9 month-old rats, exposure to Fasudil increased the daily food intake as well as hypothalamic mRNA level of the orexigenic NPY peptide without modulation of the anorexigenic POMC gene expression. Altogether, our data suggest that prenatal Fasudil exposure alleviates fetal growth in IUGR rats, but programs long-term metabolic disturbances including transient perturbations of glucose metabolism, a persistent increase of body weight gain, hyperphagia and an augmented expression of hypothalamic NPY orexigenic gene. We postulate that Fasudil treatment during <b>perinatal</b> <b>periods</b> may predispose individuals to the development of metabolic disorders...|$|R
40|$|Animal {{and human}} studies {{revealed}} that patterned neuronal activity is an inherent feature of developing nervous systems. This review summarizes our current {{knowledge about the}} mechanisms generating early electrical activity patterns {{and their impact on}} structural and functional development of the cerebral cortex. All neocortical areas display distinct spontaneous and sensory-driven neuronal activity patterns already at early phases of development. At embryonic stages, intermittent spontaneous activity is synchronized within small neuronal networks, becoming more complex with further development. This transition is accompanied by a gradual shift from electrical to chemical synaptic transmission, with a particular role of non-synaptic tonic currents before the onset of phasic synaptic activity. In this review article we first describe functional impacts of classical neurotransmitters (GABA, glutamate) and modulatory systems (e. g., acetylcholine, ACh) on early neuronal activities in the neocortex with special emphasis on electrical synapses, nonsynaptic and synaptic currents. Early neuronal activity influences probably all developmental processes and is crucial for the proper formation of neuronal circuits. In the second part of our review, we illustrate how specific activity patterns might interfere with distinct neurodevelopmental processes like proliferation, migration, axonal and dendritic sprouting, synapse formation and neurotransmitter specification. Finally, we present evidence that transient alterations in neuronal activity during restricted <b>perinatal</b> <b>periods</b> can lead to persistent changes in functional connectivity and therefore might underlie the manifestation of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases...|$|R
40|$|Gonadal steroids, in {{particular}} estradiol, exert important actions during pre- and <b>perinatal</b> <b>periods</b> {{in the regulation}} of sexual dimorphism {{and development of the}} nervous system. We have now examined the effects of neonatal estradiol administration in female rats on brain concentrations of the neuroactive steroids allopregnanolone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits, and behavioral sensitivity to benzodiazepines and allopregnanolone. Administration of beta-estradiol 3 -benzoate on the day of birth resulted in marked decreases in the concentrations of progesterone and allopregnanolone in the cerebral cortex at 21, 60, and 180 days after birth. The concentrations of tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, 17 beta-estradiol, and dehydroepiandrosterone in the brain at 60 days were not affected by such treatment. Neonatal administration of beta-estradiol 3 -benzoate also increased the cerebrocortical abundance of alpha(1), alpha(2), and gamma(2) subunits of the GABA(A) receptor without affecting that of alpha(3), alpha(4), alpha(5), or delta subunits. Diazepam induced a greater reduction in locomotor activity as well as a more pronounced anxiolytic-like effect in the elevated plus-maze test in rats subjected to neonatal treatment with beta-estradiol 3 -benzoate than in vehicle-treated controls, while allopregnanolone induced a similar effect in both groups. These effects of estradiol suggest that it {{plays a major role in}} regulation both of GABAergic transmission and of the abundance of endogenous modulators of such transmission during development of the central nervous system...|$|R

40|$|In mammals, {{the limited}} {{regenerating}} {{potential of the}} central nervous system (CNS) in adults contrasts with the plasticity of the embryonic and <b>perinatal</b> <b>periods.</b> SCO (subcommissural organ) -spondin is a protein secreted early by the developing central nervous system, potentially involved in the development of commissural fibers. SCO-spondin stimulates neuronal differentiation and neurite growth in vitro. NX 210 oligopeptide was designed from SCO-spondin’s specific thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) sequences that support the main neurogenic properties of the molecule. The objective of this work was to assess the neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties of NX 210 in vitro and in vivo for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). In vitro studies were carried out on the B 104 neuroblastoma cell line demonstrating neuroprotection by the resistance to oxidative damage using hydrogen peroxide and the measure of cell viability by metabolic activity. In vivo studies were performed in two rat models of SCI: (1) a model of aspiration of dorsal funiculi followed by the insertion of a collagen tube in situ to limit collateral sprouting; white matter regeneration was assessed using neurofilament immunostaining; (2) a rat spinal cord contusion model to assess functional recovery using BBB scale and reflex testing.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the feto-infant mortality rate for New York City, assess racial/ethnic variations and identify areas for intervention using the <b>Perinatal</b> <b>Periods</b> of Risk (PPOR) approach. METHODS: The PPOR model examines fetal and infant deaths by {{age at death}} (fetal, neonatal, postneonatal) and birthweight (500 - 1499, > or = 1500 g). It groups age at death and birthweight into four categories to identify problems hypothesized {{to lead to the}} death: factors related to Maternal Health and Prematurity, Maternal Care, Newborn Care and Infant Health. The model was applied to fetal and infant deaths occurring in New York City using Vital Records data from 1996 - 2000. Analysis was completed for the entire city and by race/ethnicity (white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Asians/Pacific Islander). RESULTS: The overall feto-infant mortality rate was 11. 5 / 1, 000 live births plus fetal deaths. This rate varied by race/ethnicity; black non-Hispanics had a higher rate than other racial/ethnic groups. Conditions related to maternal health and prematurity were the largest contributing factors to feto-infant mortality (5. 9 / 1000) in New York City. Among blacks and Hispanics, problems related to maternal health and prematurity contributed a larger share than among whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders. CONCLUSION: The use of the PPOR approach shows that the racial/ethnic disparities in feto-infant mortality that exist in New York City are largely related to maternal health and prematurity.
