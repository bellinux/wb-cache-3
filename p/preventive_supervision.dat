Huseby stated that the hijacking was spontaneous and that he planned to make an armed robbery or take hostages at the Radisson SAS hotel in Oslo. His defence lawyer argued that Huseby did not commit a hijacking in the letter of the law, but had instead taken hostages, which would result in a lesser sentence. The court psychologists stated that Huseby had a difficult childhood, and had been defined as an alcoholic at the age of 17. They considered him to have very underdeveloped ability to make rational decisions and weak mental health. They also stated that he committed crimes to identify himself due to his low self-esteem. On 29 May 1986, Huseby was found guilty of hijacking in Eidsivating Court of Appeal. He was sentenced to three years prison and five years of <b>preventive</b> <b>supervision.</b>|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesRisk {{assessments}} {{provided to}} judicial decision makers {{as a part}} of the current generation of legislation for protecting the public from sexual offenders can have a profound impact on the rights of individual offenders. This article will identify some of the human rights issues inherent in using the current assessment procedures to formulate and communicate risk as a forensic expert in cases involving civil commitment, <b>preventive</b> detention, extended <b>supervision,</b> or special conditions of parole. MethodBased on the current professional literature and applied experience in legal proceedings under community protection laws in the United States and New Zealand, potential threats to the rights of offenders are identified. Central to these considerations are issues of the accuracy of current risk assessment measures, communicating the findings of risk assessment appropriately to the court, and the availability of competent forensic mental health professionals in carrying out these functions. The role of the forensic expert is discussed in light of the competing demands of protecting individual human rights and community protection. ConclusionActuarial risk assessment represents the best practice for informing judicial decision makers in cases involving sex offenders, yet these measures currently demonstrate substantial limitations in predictive accuracy when applied to individual offenders. These limitations must be clearly articulated when reporting risk assessment findings. Sufficient risk assessment expertise should be available to provide a balanced application of community protection laws. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Various {{problematic}} regulations {{recently come}} up into surface including either those stood oppositely against the superior regulations, {{or those with}} disobedience with the sociological condition. Almost all locals have similar visions, such as improving the local genuine revenue by developing local tax and retribution. Local tax and retribution in general prevail through local regulation. Research may determine the following problems: (1) {{what will be the}} supervision system against the content of local regulation in pursuant to Internal Affair Minister’s Decree No. 53 of 2007 on The Supervision of Local Regulation and Local Leader Regulation; and (2) what will be the conflict resolution when the Local Leader should complaint against the evaluation of local regulation in pursuant to Internal Affair Minister’s Decree No. 53 of 2007 on The Supervision of Local Regulation and Local Leader Regulation. Research employs normative law research approach, or called as doctrinal research. Techniques used involve exploring and collecting the data required by library research and surfing through Internet. Conceptual framework seems important to analyze law materials or its discussion, and therefore, theoretical approach comes into consideration as basic standing involving expert’s opinion, rules, or law bases. Results of research underline the preventive and repressive supervision systems. <b>Preventive</b> <b>supervision</b> system can be conducted before the decision or regulation will be prevailed. The supervision emphasizes on the plan of local regulation about local tax and retribution, Local Budget, and local space order before the Local Leader gives acknowledgement after the evaluation of Internal Affair Minister. Repressive supervision system may be implemented after the local regulation should be determined and prevailed. The repressive supervision system has been widely recognized. Two doors open for conflict resolution. First, invalidation by central through Internal Affair Minister may be needed, while second, law action through system should be important after test against the law product (material test) by Supreme Court. In conclusion, the supervision system against local regulation classifies into two systems of supervision: (a) <b>preventive</b> <b>supervision</b> system and (b) repressive supervision system. When the conflict of local regulation invalidation occurs, the Local Leader finds necessary to submit law action through material test to Supreme Court. Research may suggest that the socialization of regulations higher than local regulation to the local government should be absolutely important to be conducted intensively by central government. The invalidation of more relevant local regulations must be empowered by President Decree because the Decree should be superior in the regulation hierarchy than local regulation...|$|E

The type of research is empirical legal research through the three-level approaches of philosophy dogmatic and theoretical laws. The research sample was determined by purposive sampling technique. Data collection instruments used where interviews and documentation collection then analyzed qualitatively. Results of the study revealed that the substance of the law governing the authority of the Judicial Commission to supervise the activity of judges is broadly in line with the principle of independent judicial power except the setting of membership composition and procedures of decision making of Honorary Judges. This is potentially affecting the independence of the judicial power. Judicial Commission applies the eclectic model of supervision by combining the model of <b>supervision</b> <b>preventive</b> but not include the recruitment promotion and transfer limited repressive and limited external supervision models external quasi. The Model of Judicial Commission monitoring for the behavior of judges is not included in the checks and balances surveillance.

Also the needs of compliance with their own professional Code of Ethics are discussed. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, voted and accepted by the United Nations in 1948 changed the strategic target of occupational medicine. Since then the most important task became prevention of health damage caused by work, which should enable the employees to stay healthy throughout the whole period of professional activity. Before that the main target was to restore the health of employees injured by work. To make the used preventive measures to be effective, they must be selected appropriately to professional harmfulness posing threat to employees health. This requires to reveal all factors potentially harmful to health, which occur in the work-environment, to measure their concentrations or intensity, to determine the employees exposure to those factors and to estimate {{the level of the}} health risk, caused by this complex exposure. Contemporarily occupational medicine service encompass with its <b>preventive</b> <b>supervision</b> the municipal environments, because they become seriously polluted due to emission of harmful industrial pollutants what brings about a negative impact to health of exposed dwellers. Those activities, being to a large extent outside the scope of competence and tasks of doctors – specialists of occupational medicine, are performed by industrial hygienists, who the required knowledge and skills acquired during university studies on technical and natural faculties. This caused a substantial increase of the role of industrial hygienists in the present activity of occupational medicine service and simultaneously took into consideration the ethical aspects of the work of these professionals. Evaluation of the backbone and the scope of work drew attention not only to the need to follow ethical principles mandatory for everybody working in occupational medicine service but also to the need to have and respect their own ethical code taking into account the specificity of activities and undertaken tasks in this profession...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of human history man has been {{changing}} his choice of food, the way of its acquisition and preparation. At present nutrition {{is considered to be}} a part of our lifestyle, on the one side it presents a source of energy, on the other side a source of vital nutrients, vitamins and minerals. Nutrition is widely affected by the socio-economic terms and conditions of the particular individual, at the same time it is a factor with a strong impact on man not only in terms of meeting his basic needs, but also in terms of his psychology. Nowadays, nutrition presents a widely discussed topic with respect to the risks of civilisation disorders, obesity in particular. Current professional estimates suggest that nutrition participates in the health condition of population by 40 to 60 percent. The objective of my work consists in mapping and comparing the conditions of operation in two social care institutions providing catering services, namely "Dětský stacionář Světluška o. p. s. and Social Care Centre Empatie, which is a part of the social care institution Libnič. The technical and operational conditions in terms of public health protection standards as related to the current legislation were dealt with. In both studied institutions an analysis and evaluation of the all-day catering of clients in compliance with the principles of healthy nutrition including drinking regime were carried out. The intake of milk, milk products, fruits and vegetables, wholemeal products (bakery products in particular), the introduction of fish meals to the menus as compared with the standards of healthy nutrition and the food pyramid were studied. The last but not least criterion of the study was the finding that clients, due to lack of exercise, tend to show a higher body mass index [...] a heavier weight [...] as compared with the recommended values. 80 clients were monitored in the Empatie institution, both children and adults, 30 clients with their age ranging between 4 and 29 years were studied in Světluška. The Hypotheses H 2 and H 3 predicting that all-day catering menus would show insufficient intake values of milk, milk products, fruits, vegetables, fish and wholemeal products on the one side, and on the other side that the technical and operational conditions of rendered catering services in terms of public health protection standards would comply with the valid legislation could be confirmed by the research carried out in both social institutions. The theory of Hypothesis H 1 related to the evaluation of the weight values of clients in both institutions due to lack of exercise has been disproved. The research results will be provided both to the two studied institutions for the purposes of increasing their quality of rendered services, and to the Regional Authority of Public Health and Hygiene KHS of the South Bohemian Region based in České Budějovice.
