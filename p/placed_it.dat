5|$|Attempts to date it have {{undergone}} similar shifts of opinion. In the 19th century the panel {{was believed to}} be an early work by Jan completed as early as c. 1410, although this view changed as scholarship progressed. In the early 20th century, Ludwig von Baldass <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> around 1424–29, then for a long period it was seen as originating from the early 1430s. Erwin Panofsky provided the first detailed treatise on the work and <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> around 1432–34. However, following research from Meyer Schapiro, he revised his opinion to the late 1430s in the 1953 edition of his Early Netherlandish Painting. A 1970s comparative study of van Eyck's 1437 Saint Barbara concluded that Madonna in the Church was completed after c. 1437. In the 1990s, Otto Pächt judged the work as probably a late van Eyck, given the similar treatment of an interior in the 1434 Arnolfini Portrait. In the early 21st century, Jeffrey Chipps Smith and John Oliver Hand <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> between 1426 and 1428, claiming it as perhaps the earliest extant signed work confirmed as by Jan.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Marcelo Weksler {{published}} a large-scale cladistic analysis of Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), the group (tribe) to which hammondi {{and the related}} species mentioned above belong. He used both morphological and molecular characters, but had only morphological data for Oryzomys hammondi. The placement of the species in his results was unstable; some trees <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> close to the tree rice rats, Oecomys, within clade B and others <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> as an isolated lineage, basal to all other Oryzomyini.|$|E
5|$|Lundomys molitor {{was first}} {{described}} in 1887 by Danish zoologist Herluf Winge, who reviewed the materials Peter Wilhelm Lund had {{collected in the}} caves of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Winge used four specimens for his description, including two skull fragments and an isolated maxilla (upper jaw) from the cave chamber Lapa da Escrivania Nr.5 and a mandible (lower jaw) from Lapa da Serra das Abelhas, but the latter later {{turned out to be}} from a different species, probably Gyldenstolpia fronto. Lund named the animal Hesperomys molitor and <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> in the same genus (Hesperomys) as what is now Pseudoryzomys simplex and two species of Calomys. Subsequently, it was rarely mentioned in the literature on South American rodents; those authors who did mention it <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> in either Oryzomys or Calomys.|$|E
