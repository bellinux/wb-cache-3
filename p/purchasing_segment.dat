50|$|The pre-purchase {{experience}} {{shows the}} {{diverse range of}} interactions the consumer has with the brand and product before they enter the store. This touchpoint interaction is devised to increase brand awareness and increase a consumer’s perception and expectation of the brand. These touchpoints should highlight the brand’s features, and benefits over other competing products increasing the brand’s value to the consumers. The pre <b>purchase</b> <b>segment</b> in the brand touch point wheel allows the customer to decide if the product or service will fulfil their needs and wants. The benefits of pre purchase touch points are that they engage prospective customers, as well as retaining current customers. During this segment of the buying process people have access to knowledge of the brand, which allows them {{to see if they}} will gain from selecting this product or service over another competing brand. An example of a pre-purchase touchpoint is public relations. Public relations creates positivity around the brand, as well as media influence over prospective customers. Websites and advertising are other pre-purchase touchpoints, which allow customers to engage and learn about products or services.|$|R

40|$|Customer-brand {{relationships}} do {{not just}} exist, they develop {{over time and}} through multiple service experiences, yet the literature typically discusses customer-brand relationships as being a largely static phenomenon. Very limited {{attention has been given}} over to the service evaluation processes of customers who are new to a service brand, as compared to customers who are experienced with the service brand. Research additionally continues to rely on the historically dominant customer satisfaction paradigm as the most effective method with which to evaluate service experiences {{at the expense of other}} relational mediators such as involvement, calculative commitment, affective commitment, and trust. This limits the extent to which a more complete and dynamic understanding of the nature of customer-brand relationships and the processes by which engagement with the brand and ultimately loyalty to the brand may be fostered for customers in different consumption stages. A phenomenological investigation into the process of customer engagement, as revealed through customers' restaurant dining experiences, is presented to examine these issues. The data for this study was provided by five focus groups and nine in-depth interviews. The results of the study indicate that the role of relational mediators differs across new and repeat <b>purchase</b> <b>segments</b> of customers. These findings have important implications for the management of customer-brand relationships amongst different customer segments and for the development of operational strategies to improve service provision within the restaurant industry. 23 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Although repeat {{purchases}} dominate overall {{sales of}} consumer durables, diffusion of innovations research has paid them {{far less attention}} than new product adoptions. A large survey of 8, 077 households allowed a detailed investigation {{of the differences between}} households in terms of their repeat purchase behavior of durables. Asymmetric effects were investigated using competing hazard models and showed that consumer innovativeness has a strong impact on discretionary replacements. A modified gamma distribution was introduced into aggregate sales modeling to account for differences between forced and discretionary replacement distributions. Insights from both the household purchasing analysis and aggregate sales modeling were integrated to develop a refined model of the product life cycle (PLC). The findings will help companies to better understand drivers of repeat <b>purchases,</b> to <b>segment</b> households in a more insightful way and to forecast repeat sales of durable goods more accurately...|$|R

The organization sponsored many steam excursions and other railfan activities throughout the region, but was working towards the goal of establishing a permanent home. [...] The possibility of <b>purchasing</b> a <b>segment</b> of the New York Central Putnam Division was considered, as the middle portion of the line was abandoned in 1962. Member Jay Wulfson took ownership of the Middletown and New Jersey Railroad, and ESRM equipment began to gather in Middletown, New York. Member Stephen D. Bogen purchased Baldwin Locomotive Works 2-6-2 #103 from the Sumter and Choctaw Railway in Alabama and had the engine shipped to New York on a flatcar. Additional equipment including coaches and a caboose were purchased and excursions began operating under the name Middletown & Orange Railroad.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, UTA {{announced}} {{a deal with}} Union Pacific to <b>purchase</b> a <b>segment</b> of track and right-of-way for a commuter rail line from Salt Lake City to Pleasant View, just northwest of Ogden.

50|$|This {{case study}} {{outlines}} {{the events that}} occurred in 1989 between Peg Goldberg, a local art dealer in Indianapolis, Indiana, and the Church of Cyprus when Goldberg gained “ownership” {{and then tried to}} sell Cypriot mosaics from the 6th century. These mosaics have been looted from the Church of the Virgin of Kankaria in the village of Lythrangomi in Northern Cyprus after surviving the 8th and 9th century. These mosaics had survived the 8th- and 9th-century iconoclasm in the Byzantine world and were considered to be finer than other mosaics, even the mosaics found in Ravenna, Italy and the mosaics in St. Catherine’s monastery in Sinai. The Kankarian mosaics were cut into pieces when they were looted from the original church, and Peg Goldberg was able to <b>purchase</b> four <b>segments</b> of these early mosaics from Aydin Dikmen. These mosaics are important to the cultural, artistic, and religious heritage of Cyprus because they are some of the few remaining Byzantine mosaics from the island; when and how these mosaics were taken from Cyprus is unknown because there is documentation to show that they were still intact in 1976, two years after the initial invasion by the Turkish troops.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} Large Scale Asset Purchases (LSAPs) in a New-Keynesian DSGE {{model that}} features distinct mortgage and corporate loan markets. We show that following a significant disruption of financial intermediation, central-bank purchases of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are uniformly less effective at easing credit market conditions and stabilizing economic activity than outright purchases of corporate bonds. Moreover, {{the size of}} the effects crucially depends {{on the extent to which}} credit markets are segmented, i. e. to which a "portfolio balance channel" is at work in the economy. More segmented credit markets imply larger, but more local effects of particular asset <b>purchases.</b> With strongly <b>segmented</b> credit markets, large scale purchases of MBS are useful to stabilize the housing market but do little to mitigate the contractionary effect of the crisis on employment and output...|$|R
5000|$|Consumers may use online {{platforms}} {{for various}} stages of the purchase decision. Some consumers use online sources simply to acquire information about planned purchases.

40|$|Using actual {{purchase}} data of {{food products}} with different labels, we examine Dutch consumers' purchases of organic, fair-trade, and health labels. Empirically, consumers' purchase behavior of labeled products {{can be categorized}} into two dimensions: a health-related and a sustainable dimension comprising the purchase of organic and fair-trade products. Using latent class analysis, we find four segments that differ in their purchase behavior of the studied labels. While one segment comprising the majority of consumers mainly purchases conventional products, a somewhat smaller <b>segment</b> <b>purchases</b> products with health labels. A third segment containing approximately 10 % of consumers purchases products with both health and sustainable labels; these consumers tend to consider the future consequences of their behavior and have higher biospheric values. The fourth segment is also small, purchases sustainable labels, has strong biospheric values, and largely considers the future consequences of current behavior; it is also less price conscious...|$|R

40|$|Public {{housing is}} the largest housing submarket in Singapore. There is also an active resale public housing market, where public housing dwellers are allowed to trade their houses after a time-bar of five years from the date of their <b>purchase.</b> This <b>segment</b> of resale HDB market is liken the private housing submarkets, where housing prices {{are more likely to}} {{fluctuate}} in accordance to the market and economic cycles. Using the STOPBREAK tests proposed by Engle and Smith (1999), the study rejected the random walk null hypothesis for relative prices in pairs of the HDB resale price and other private housing prices. The public and private housing market is thus not segmented. When we further examined whether the STOPBREAK process persist in other pairs of private housing submarkets, we found weak evidence to suggest the stratification of the private housing market. We also found that price discovery processes between the resale HDB housing market and other private submarkets occurred through at least one cointegrating equation in our vector autoregressive error correction models (VECM). In the private housing submarkets, we observed significant and positive price effects from detached submarket to other private housing submarkets, which may imply that the increase in housing wealth of detached households, who are less financially constrained, will motivate them to allocate part of their accrued wealth through investment in other private housing submarkets. The wealth accrued in detached housing submarket is translated into price increases in other private housing sector. Keywords...|$|R
