5|$|Corbulo {{had placed}} {{a large number}} of his {{auxiliaries}} in a line of forts near the Armenian frontier under a former primus <b>pilus,</b> Paccius Orfitus. Disobeying Corbulo's orders, he used some newly arrived auxiliary cavalry alae to stage a raid against the Armenians, who appeared to be unprepared. In the event, his raid failed, and the retreating troops even spread their panic amongst the garrisons of the other forts. It was an inauspicious start for a campaign, and Corbulo severely punished the survivors and their commanders.|$|E
5|$|Andreacarus voalavo is a {{parasitic}} mite {{found on}} the Malagasy rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus. First described in 2007, it {{is closely related to}} Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus, which are found on other Malagasy rodents. The length of the idiosoma, the main body, is 630 to 670μm in females and 450 to 480μm in males. Unlike A.eliurus, this species lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between two lyrifissures (sensory organs) on {{the lower part of the}} female body. The <b>pilus</b> dentilis, a sensory organ on the chelicera, is serrate, which distinguishes it from A.gymnuromys. Females of A.gymnuromys also have a less ornamented sternal shield (covering part of the underparts) and shorter setae (bristles) on the upperparts.|$|E
5|$|From {{a survey}} by Devijver of persons whose origin can be determined, it appears that during the 1st century, the large {{majority}} (65%) of auxiliary prefects were of Italian origin. The Italian proportion dropped steadily, to 38% in the 2nd century, and 21% in the 3rd century. From the time of emperor Claudius (r. 41-54) only Roman knights were eligible to hold command of an auxiliary regiment. This status could be obtained either by birth (i.e. if the person {{was the son of}} a hereditary Roman knight; or by attaining the property qualification (100,000 denarii, the equivalent of 400 years' gross salary for an auxiliary alaris); or by military promotion: the latter were the chief centurions of legions (centurio primus <b>pilus)</b> who would normally be elevated to equestrian rank by the emperor after completing their single-year term as primuspilus.|$|E
5|$|In the female, the <b>pilus</b> dentilis, a sensory organ on the {{chelicera}} (mouthpart), is serrate, not {{smooth as}} in A.gymnuromys. The idiosoma (main {{part of the}} body) is 630 to 670μm long and 370 to 435μm wide and the dorsal shield (covering the upper side) is 620 to 655μm long and 360 to 370μm wide. The dorsal setae (bristles) are long relative to A.gymnuromys. The sternal shield (on the lower {{side of the body}}) is 115 to 125μm long and 184 to 200μm wide and is more ornamented than in A.gymnuromys. Unlike A.eliurus, A.voalavo lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between the lyrifissures (sensory organs) iv1 and iv2 on the lower side of the body. The other shields on the lower side of the body are the genitoventral shield (232 to 253 by 170 to 182μm), the peritrematic shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm), and the anal shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm). On the soft part of the cuticle, there are nine pairs of setae. The first segments of the legs, the coxae, lack hooks. On the coxae of the third pair of legs, the setae at the back are spur-like.|$|E
25|$|The rank of centurion was {{an officer}} grade that {{included}} many ranks, meaning centurions had very good prospects for promotion. The most senior centurion in a legion {{was known as}} the primus <b>pilus</b> (first file or spear), who directly commanded the first century of the first cohort and commanded the whole first cohort when in battle. Within the second to tenth cohorts, the commander of each cohort's first century was known as a <b>pilus</b> prior and was in command of his entire cohort when in battle. The seniority of the <b>pilus</b> prior centurions was followed by the five other century commanders of the first cohort, who were known as primi ordines.|$|E
25|$|Expression {{of certain}} genes, for example those coding for <b>pilus</b> {{expression}} in E. coli, is {{regulated by the}} methylation of GATC sites in the promoter region of the gene operon. The cells' environmental conditions just after DNA replication determine whether Dam is blocked from methylating a region proximal to or distal from the promoter region. Once the pattern of methylation has been created, the <b>pilus</b> gene transcription is locked in the on or off position until the DNA is again replicated. In E. coli, these <b>pilus</b> operons have important roles in virulence in urinary tract infections. It has been proposed that inhibitors of Dam may function as antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|A fimbria {{also known}} as a <b>pilus</b> is a short, thin, hair-like {{filament}} found on the surface of bacteria. Fimbriae, or pili are formed of a protein called pilin (antigenic) and are responsible for attachment of bacteria to specific receptors of human cell (cell adhesion). There are special types of specific pili involved in bacterial conjugation.|$|E
25|$|Praefectus castrorum, Camp Prefect: The Camp Prefect {{was third}} {{in command of}} the legion. Generally he was a long serving veteran from a lower social status than the tribunii whom he outranked, and who {{previously}} had served as primus <b>pilus</b> and finished his 25 years with the legions. He was used as a senior officer in charge of training a legion, though he could also command a cohort of auxiliaires.|$|E
25|$|All that {{is known}} about Artorius's life comes from two Latin {{inscriptions}} discovered in the 19th century in Podstrana on the Dalmatian coast. After a long, distinguished career as a centurion and then primus <b>pilus</b> in the Roman army, Artorius was promoted to praefectus legionis ('legion prefect') or praefectus castrorum ('fort prefect') of the legion VI Victrix, a unit that had been headquartered at Eboracum (York) since c. 122 CE. The praefectus served as third-in-command of the legion, and {{was responsible for the}} general upkeep of the legionary headquarters, a position normally held by older career soldiers who did not command soldiers in battle.|$|E
25|$|Other centurions: Each legion had 59 or 60 centurions, one {{to command}} each century of the 10 cohorts. They were the {{backbone}} of the professional army and were the career soldiers who ran the day-to-day life of the soldiers and issued commands in the field. They were generally moved up from the ranks, but in some cases could be direct appointments from the emperor or other higher-ranking officials. The cohorts were ranked from the first to the tenth and the century within each cohort ranked from 1 to 6, with only five centuries in the first cohort (for a total of 59 centurions and the primus <b>pilus).</b> The century that each centurion commanded was a direct reflection of his rank: command of the 1st century of the first cohort was the highest, and the 6th century of the 10th cohort was the lowest. Paid ten times the basic wage.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} Marian reforms, the legions' {{internal}} {{organization was}} standardized. Each legion was divided into cohorts. Prior to this, cohorts had been temporary administrative units or tactical task forces of several maniples, even more transitory than the legions themselves. Now the cohorts were ten permanent units, composed of 6 centuries {{and in the case}} of the first cohort 12 centuries each led by a centurion assisted by an optio. The cohorts came to form the basic tactical unit of the legions. Ranking within the legion was based on length of service, with the senior Centurion commanding the first century of the first cohort; he was called the primus <b>pilus</b> (First Spear), and reported directly to the superior officers (legates and tribuni). All career soldiers could be promoted to the higher ranks in recognition of exceptional acts of bravery or valour. A newly promoted junior Centurion would be assigned to the sixth century of the tenth cohort and slowly progressed through the ranks from there.|$|E
25|$|Agrobacterium-mediated {{transformation}} {{is the easiest}} and most simple plant transformation. Plant tissue (often leaves) are cut into small pieces, e.g. 10x10mm, and soaked for 10 minutes in a fluid containing suspended Agrobacterium. The bacteria will attach {{to many of the}} plant cells exposed by the cut. The plant cells secrete wound-related phenolic compounds which in turn act to upregulate the virulence operon of the Agrobacterium. The virulence operon includes many genes that encode for proteins that are part of a Type IV secretion system that exports from the bacterium proteins and DNA (delineated by specific recognition motifs called border sequences and excised as a single strand from the virulence plasmid) into the plant cell through a structure called a <b>pilus.</b> The transferred DNA (called T-DNA) is piloted to the plant cell nucleus by nuclear localization signals present in the Agrobacterium protein VirD2, which is covalently attached {{to the end of the}} T-DNA at the Right border (RB). Exactly how the T-DNA is integrated into the host plant genomic DNA is an active area of plant biology research. Assuming that a selection marker (such as an antibiotic resistance gene) was included in the T-DNA, the transformed plant tissue can be cultured on selective media to produce shoots. The shoots are then transferred to a different medium to promote root formation. Once roots begin to grow from the transgenic shoot, the plants can be transferred to soil to complete a normal life cycle (make seeds). The seeds from this first plant (called the T1, for first transgenic generation) can be planted on a selective (containing an antibiotic), or if an herbicide resistance gene was used, could alternatively be planted in soil, then later treated with herbicide to kill wildtype segregants. Some plants species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana can be transformed by dipping the flowers or whole plant, into a suspension of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, typically strain C58 (C=Cherry, 58=1958, the year in which this particular strain of A. tumefaciens was isolated from a cherry tree in an orchard at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York). Though many plants remain recalcitrant to transformation by this method, research is ongoing that continues to add to the list the species that have been successfully modified in this manner.|$|E
500|$|Fimbriae (sometimes called [...] "attachment pili") {{are fine}} {{filaments}} of protein, usually 2–10nanometres {{in diameter and}} up to several micrometres in length. They are distributed {{over the surface of}} the cell, and resemble fine hairs when seen under the electron microscope. Fimbriae are believed to be involved in attachment to solid surfaces or to other cells, and are essential for the virulence of some bacterial pathogens. Pili (sing. <b>pilus)</b> are cellular appendages, slightly larger than fimbriae, that can transfer genetic material between bacterial cells in a process called conjugation where they are called conjugation pili or [...] "sex pili" [...] (see bacterial genetics, below). They can also generate movement where they are called type IV pili (see movement, below).|$|E

2500|$|The term first {{appears in}} the late 1st century BC in the Hellenistic Near East. Its origin is unclear, but it {{is used as a}} translation, in some inscriptions, for the {{contemporary}} Roman legionary post of praefectus castrorum ("camp prefect"). Josephus (De Bello Judaico, VI.238) uses the term to refer to the quartermaster-general of all camps, while Dionysius of Halicarnassus (Roman Antiquities, X.36.6) used it to refer to the role of a primus <b>pilus</b> in a legion that had lost its commander. It also occurs in the Bible (...) , where it has been interpreted as referring to the praetorian prefect, the commander of the camp and garrison of the Praetorian Guard in Rome, or the subordinate officials praefectus peregrinorum and princeps castrorum.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{ship was}} {{commanded}} by a trierarchus, whose exact {{relationship with the}} ship's centurion is unclear. Squadrons, most likely of ten ships each, were put under a nauarchus, who often appears to have risen {{from the ranks of}} the trierarchi. The post of nauarchus archigubernes or nauarchus princeps appeared later in the Imperial period, and functioned either as a commander of several squadrons or as an executive officer under a civilian admiral, equivalent to the legionary primus <b>pilus.</b> All these were professional officers, usually peregrini, who had a status equal to an auxiliary centurion (and were thus increasingly called centuriones [...] after ca. 70 AD). Until the reign of Antoninus Pius, their careers were restricted to the fleet. Only in the 3rd century were these officers equated to the legionary centurions in status and pay, and could henceforth be transferred to a similar position in the legions.|$|E
2500|$|In 18, Camillus was {{replaced}} by Lucius Apronius as proconsul of Africa. Tacfarinas launched a series of lightning raids on Roman territory, destroying the villages he had ransacked and disappearing into the desert before Roman forces could intervene. Emboldened by success, Tacfarinas attempted a conventional siege operation. His men surrounded a strategic Roman fort on the river Pagyda (location uncertain) held by a cohort of the 3rd legion. Its commander, one Decrius (presumably the cohort's most senior centurion - the <b>pilus</b> prior or [...] "front spear" [...] centurion), [...] "considered it disgraceful that Roman legionaries should sit besieged by a rabble of deserters and tramps", Tacitus reports. Decrius ordered a sortie. His troops tried {{to break through the}} besiegers, but were soon forced back by the far superior numbers of enemy. Decrius, cursing his standard-bearers for not standing their ground, shouted at his men to follow him. Although struck by arrows in one eye and in several other places, he rushed at the enemy. But his men retreated into the fort as their commander went down fighting. Roman soldiers were forbidden to retreat before an enemy unless ordered to do so by their commander. When Apronius was informed of the incident, he ordered the cohort to be decimated for cowardice. This ancient, extreme and rarely used form of military punishment required every tenth man in the unit (i.e. ca. 50 men in this case), chosen by lot, to be flogged to death in front of their comrades. The savage penalty [...] "evidently had a salutary effect", according to Tacitus: at the next fort to come under attack by Tacfarinas, Thala (Thala, Tunisia, the site of a Roman victory over an earlier Numidian rebel leader, Jugurtha, some 120 years before), the garrison of 500 elderly veterans beat off the assailants.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pilus</b> biogenesis {{proceeds}} via {{the strand}} complementation mechanism, the mechanism {{functions as a}} direct consequence of the structures of both the chaperones and <b>pilus</b> subunits. Both the G1 extension of the chaperone and the N-terminal extension of the <b>pilus</b> subunits can bind to the hydrophobic P1-P5 cleft. When the G1 is bound it binds in a parallel conformation stabilising the subunit structure but doesn't form a true Ig fold (which is anti-parallel). It also only binds the cleft from sites P1-P4 leaving the P5 pocket exposed. When another subunit binds the hydrophobic cleft it binds in a P5-P2 anti-parallel fashion creating the most energetically favourable conformation of a true Ig-fold.When a chaperone/subunit complex is brought to the growing usher/pilus complex (note that a chaperone/subunit complex forms the base of this) the NTD and CTDs of the usher dimer bring and hold the chaperone/subunit complex to the <b>pilus</b> base. Here the N-terminal extension of the subunit interacts with the free P5 pocket of the <b>pilus.</b> This binding causes a residue by residue 'unzipping' of the chaperone's G1 strand with concurrent 'zipping' of the N-terminal extension of the chaperone/subunit complex, unknown as the zip in-zip out mechanism. Once the chaperone has been displaced it diffuses back to the sec machinery to bind another emerging <b>pilus</b> subunit. The usher using is CTDs then translocates the longer <b>pilus</b> across the translocation pore by one residue until the chaperone is in close association with the usher. This translocation is coupled with a slight rotation giving the <b>pilus</b> its helical structure. This growth proceeds until a terminating subunit binds the <b>pilus</b> (if one exists), terminating subunits lack the P5 pocket and thus almost irreversibly bind their chaperone. Since the usher can only translocate <b>pilus</b> subunits and not chaperone/subunit complexes, {{and the fact that the}} chaperone can't be energetically out-competed by another subunit (due to lack of P5) this terminating subunit anchors the <b>pilus</b> to the outer membrane and stop any further <b>pilus</b> growth.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>pilus</b> (Latin for 'hair'; plural : pili) is a hair-like {{appendage}} {{found on}} the surface of many bacteria. [...] The terms <b>pilus</b> and fimbria (Latin for 'fringe'; plural: fimbriae) can be used interchangeably, although some researchers reserve the term <b>pilus</b> for the appendage required for bacterial conjugation.

5000|$|The <b>pilus</b> subunit {{structure}} {{also has}} an Ig-like fold but with an essential N-terminal extension rather than a C-terminal extension. Because this N-terminal extension is the same β strand that normally completes the Ig fold, a large hydrophobic cleft is formed in the mature subunit (P1-P5), this cleft is both essential to <b>pilus</b> biogenesis but also necessitates a chaperone to stabilise the structure. [...] Particular subunits may have additional domains e.g. papG has an adhesive lectin domain.
