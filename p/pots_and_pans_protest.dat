50|$|Beginning in 1986, CBS adapted a {{theme that}} has affectionately been {{referred}} to as the <b>Pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pans</b> (because of the background notes often resembled the banging of <b>pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>pans)</b> theme. This particular theme was an intense, kinetic, synthesizer-laced theme. In 1989, the <b>Pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pans</b> theme was revamped to give it a more smooth, electronic style. This theme was also known for integrating the play-by-play announcer's voice-over introduction into the theme, it integrated three voice-over segments, one for the visiting team, home team, and game storyline to set the game storyline into the broadcast. This practice was common with CBS Sports themes of the 1980s.|$|R
