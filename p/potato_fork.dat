60|$|An old {{man came}} {{around the corner of the}} house with a <b>potato</b> <b>fork</b> in his hands, his teeth {{displayed}} in a grin.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Potter {{concluded}} by emphatically stabbing a <b>potato</b> {{with her}} <b>fork,</b> {{and beginning to}} peel it.|$|R
60|$|Jack {{glowered at}} her with the one unbandaged eye, and growled {{something}} under his breath, {{and then began to}} stab meat and <b>potatoes</b> with his <b>fork.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{that hand}} {{is going to}} take that coffee to--no, it's gone to the other mouth; I can't {{understand}} it; and Now, here is the dark-complected hand with a <b>potato</b> in its <b>fork,</b> I'll see what goes with it--there, the light-complected head's got it, as sure as I live!" ...|$|R
60|$|They had a merry {{time that}} night, quite like old times. The {{biscuits}} were light and flaky, the honey was delightsome, and {{the milk and}} butter (procured specially) were fresh. They shouted in laughter as Flaxen insisted on their eating <b>potatoes</b> with a <b>fork,</b> and opposed {{the use of the}} knife in scooping up the honey from their plates! Even the saturnine Bert forgot his gloom and laughed too, as Ans laboriously dipped his honey with a fork, and, finally growing desperate, split a biscuit in half, and in the good old boyish way sopped it in the honey.|$|R
60|$|Further {{conversation}} is prevented, for the time, by the necessity under which Mr. Bagnet finds himself of directing the whole {{force of his}} mind to the dinner, {{which is a little}} endangered by the dry humour of the fowls in not yielding any gravy, and also by the made gravy acquiring no flavour and turning out of a flaxen complexion. With a similar perverseness, the <b>potatoes</b> crumble off <b>forks</b> in the process of peeling, upheaving from their centres in every direction, as if they were subject to earthquakes. The legs of the fowls, too, are longer than could be desired, and extremely scaly. Overcoming these disadvantages to the best of his ability, Mr. Bagnet at last dishes and they sit down at table, Mrs. Bagnet occupying the guest's place at his right hand.|$|R
50|$|Prior to cooking, {{the potato}} should be {{scrubbed}} clean, washed and dried with eyes and surface blemishes removed, and basted with oil (usually Olive oil) or butter and/or salt. Pricking the <b>potato</b> with a <b>fork</b> or knife allows steam to escape during the cooking process. Potatoes cooked {{in a microwave}} oven without pricking the skin might split open due to built up internal pressure from unvented steam. It takes between one and two hours to bake a large potato in a conventional oven at 200 C. Microwaving takes from six to twelve minutes depending on oven power and potato size, but does not generally produce a crisp skin. Some recipes call for use of both a microwave and a conventional oven, with the microwave being used to vent most of the steam prior to the cooking process.|$|R
