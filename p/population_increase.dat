40|$|In this paper, an {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} spread of malaria that incorporates recruitment of human population through constant immigration is considered. The growth of mosquito population density is taken to be logistic. We define a reproductive number, and observe that the disease-free equilibrium is unstable when We prove the existence and local asymptotic stability of endemic equilibrium point for By stability analysis of ordinary differential equation, the conditions for global stability of endemic equilibrium are obtained. It is found that when the constant immigration rate and the recovery rate coefficient of the human <b>population</b> <b>increases,</b> the infective human <b>population</b> <b>increases.</b> Further, it is shown that as the growth rate and carrying capacity of mosquito <b>population</b> <b>increases,</b> the infective human <b>population</b> <b>increases...</b>|$|R

The administrative {{functions of the}} area were initially concentrated in Halton, which contained a castle and a court, while the parish church was in Runcorn.

5|$|Dayton's {{population}} declined {{significantly from}} a peak of 262,332 residents in 1960 to only 141,527 in 2010. This was in part due to the slowdown of the region's manufacturing and the growth of Dayton's affluent suburbs including Oakwood, Englewood, Beavercreek, Springboro, Miamisburg, Kettering, and Centerville. The city's most populous ethnic group, white, declined from 78.1% in 1960 to 51.7% by 2010.

5|$|The temple {{properties}} were {{no longer}} cultivated, and tanks were not maintained. Thus the population was surviving on slash and burn agriculture. British colonial policies favored the conversion of these lands into lucrative coconut plantations quickly covering all suitable Pattuva lands. Establishments of large-scale plantations also led to <b>population</b> <b>increase</b> due to migration and settlement of plantation workers from {{the interior of the}} country. This led to a demographic change, and the local Pattuva people became disassociated from the temple and its administration.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the War of 1812, the {{population}} of St. Louis and the Missouri Territory began expanding quickly. During this expansion land was donated for the Old St. Louis County Courthouse. The <b>population</b> <b>increase</b> stirred interest in statehood for Missouri, and in 1820, Congress passed the Missouri Compromise, authorizing Missouri's admission as a slave state. The state constitutional convention and first General Assembly met in St. Louis in 1820. Shortly thereafter, St. Louis incorporated as a city, on December 9, 1822. The first mayor of the city was William Carr Lane, and a Board of Aldermen replaced the earlier Board of Trustees. Early city government focused on improvements to the riverfront and health conditions. In addition to a street paving program, the aldermen voted to rename the streets.|$|E
5|$|Between 1847 and 1870, the {{population}} of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000. The Gold Rush wealth and <b>population</b> <b>increase</b> led to significantly improved transportation between California and the East Coast. The Panama Railway, spanning the Isthmus of Panama, was finished in 1855. Steamships, including those owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, began regular service from San Francisco to Panama, where passengers, goods and mail would take the train across the Isthmus and board steamships headed to the East Coast. One ill-fated journey, that of the S.S. Central America, ended in disaster as the ship sank in a hurricane {{off the coast of}} the Carolinas in 1857, with approximately three tons of California gold aboard.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers eat large {{quantities}} of foliage both as adults and during their development, and can be serious pests of arid land and prairies. Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops can be affected. Grasshoppers often bask in the sun, and thrive in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations. A single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a massive <b>population</b> <b>increase,</b> but several successive dry seasons can do so, especially if the intervening winters are mild so {{that large numbers of}} nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, there needs to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population. This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth, prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development.|$|E

The city is the third most densely populated large U.S. city of over half a million residents.

5|$|Other {{people from}} much further afield {{in the former}} British colonies have arrived since the 1950s: in particular, 6% {{of people living in}} England have family origins in the Indian subcontinent, mostly India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. 2.90% of the {{population}} are black, from Africa and the Caribbean, especially former British colonies. There is a significant number of Chinese and British Chinese. In 2007, 22% of primary school children in England were from ethnic minority families, and in 2011 that figure was 26.5%. About half of the <b>population</b> <b>increase</b> between 1991 and 2001 was due to immigration.

Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased and the range of the white-backed woodpecker enlarged as it extended eastwards.
