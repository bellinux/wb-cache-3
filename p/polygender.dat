50|$|Trigenderism is a non-binary gender {{identity}} {{in which one}} shifts between or among the behaviors of three genders, which could include male, female, and third gender (or genderless, non-gender, <b>polygender,</b> or any other variety of genderqueer identities). Someone who is also gender fluid may mix two or more genders at a time. Trigender falls under the general category of genderqueer or androgyny, a {{gender identity}} {{that goes beyond the}} normal binary gender system (male and female) and tends to be a catch-all place for other gender identities. It can also be seen as the equivalent cultures that recognize individuals to define their own sense of self.|$|E

In 2017, the Unitarian Universalist Association's General Assembly voted to create inclusive wordings for non-binary, genderqueer, gender fluid, agender, intersex, two-spirit and <b>polygender</b> people, replacing the words [...] "men and women" [...] {{with the word}} [...] "people." [...] Of the six sources of the living tradition, the second source of faith, as documented in the bylaws of the denomination, now includes “Words and deeds of prophetic people which challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil with justice, compassion, and the transforming power of love.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Some Christian {{denominations}} accept transgender {{people as}} members and clergy. Unitarian Universalism, a liberal religion with roots in liberal Christianity, {{became the first}} denomination to accept openly transgender people as full members with eligibility to become clergy (in 1979), {{and the first to}} open an Office of Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Concerns (in 1973). In 1988 the first openly transgender person was ordained by the Unitarian Universalist Association. In 2002 Rev. Sean Dennison became the first openly transgender person in the Unitarian Universalist ministry called to serve a congregation; he was called to South Valley UU Society, Salt Lake City, UT. In 2003 the United Church of Christ General Synod called for full inclusion of transgender persons. In 2005 Sarah Jones became the first openly transgender person to be ordained by the Church of England as a priest: the first transperson to minister in the Church of England was Carol Stone, who had been ordained in 1978 and transitioned in 2000. In 2008, the United Methodist Church Judicial Council ruled that openly transgender pastor Drew Phoenix could keep his position. At the UMC General Conference the same year, several petitions that would have forbidden transgender clergy and added anti-transgender language to the Book of Discipline were rejected. In 2012 the Episcopal Church in the United States approved a change to their nondiscrimination canons to include gender identity and expression. In 2013 Shannon Kearns became the first openly transgender person ordained by the North American Old Catholic Church. He was ordained in Minneapolis. In 2014 Megan Rohrer became the first openly transgender leader of a Lutheran congregation (specifically, Grace Evangelical Lutheran Church of San Francisco.)

[...] Of the six sources of the living tradition, the second source of faith, as documented in the bylaws of the denomination, now includes “Words and deeds of prophetic people which challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil with justice, compassion, and the transforming power of love.” Also in 2017, the General Synod of the Church of England passed a motion stating, [...] "That this Synod, recognising the need for transgender people to be welcomed and affirmed in their parish church, call on the House of Bishops to consider whether some nationally commended liturgical materials might be prepared to mark a person's gender transition." ...|$|E
