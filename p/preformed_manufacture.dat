40|$|This {{research}} {{reports on the}} feasibility of aligning the glass fibre bundles, {{in the form of}} short individual filaments, called short-glass fibre bundles for the manufacture of fibre reinforced polymer composites or preforms. Traditionally, <b>preforms</b> are <b>manufactured</b> using "chopped fibre bundles‟ have been available number of years, here the short-glass fibre bundles arranged randomly, but they cannot be laid over complex moulds without causing significant wrinkles and folds.

40|$|Textile {{composites}} {{describe a}} broad range of polymer composite materials with textile reinforcements, from woven and non-crimp commodity fabrics to three dimensional textiles. In a general manner textile composites are based on textile <b>preforms</b> <b>manufactured</b> by some textile processing technique and on some resin infiltration and consolidation technique. Due to the complex three-dimensional structure of textile composites, experimental determination of strength parameters is not an easy procedure. Especially the through-thickness parameters are hardly to obtain. Therefore, in addition to real material testings, virtual material testings are performed by use of an information-passing multiscale approach. The multiscale approach consists of three scales and is based on computation of representative volume elements (RVE’s) on micro-, meso- and macroscale. The micromechanical RVE enables to determine stiffness and strength parameters of unidirectional fiber bundle material. Further, statistical distribution of fibers is investigated.

40|$|International audienceErbium-doped {{amplifiers}} (EDFAs) are {{of special}} interest for space applications. In this environment, the ionizing radiations decrease the gain of these optical amplifiers, due to the ionization of defects precursors, mainly linked to dopants as Germanium (Ge), Aluminum (Al), or Phosphorus (P). The aim of this work is to study {{the influence of the}} Ge and Al relative concentration on the radiation resistance of different nanostructured fiber <b>preforms,</b> <b>manufactured</b> by Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition (MCVD), in which various types of nanoparticles (Er@SiO 2 -NP, Al 2 O 3 -NP, and Er@Al 2 O 3 -NP) have been introduced in the silica matrix.

All of them have been characterized by optical absorption and Electronic Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopies before and after irradiation with a total gamma dose of 5. 9 kGy. EPR results show that Al-related defects are not observed in fiber preforms with Ge concentrations higher than 4. 4 wt%.

5000|$|Advantages: Very {{high volumes}} are produced. Little {{restriction}} on bottle design. Preforms {{can be sold}} as a completed item for a third party to blow. Is suitable for cylindrical, rectangular or oval bottles.Disadvantages: High capital cost. Floor space required is high, although compact systems have become available. In the single-stage process both <b>preform</b> <b>manufacture</b> and bottle blowing are performed in the same machine. The older 4-station method of injection, reheat, stretch blow and ejection is more costly than the 3-station machine which eliminates the reheat stage and uses latent heat in the preform, thus saving costs of energy to reheat and 25% reduction in tooling. The process explained: Imagine the molecules are small round balls, when together they have large air gaps and small surface contact, by first stretching the molecules vertically then blowing to stretch horizontally the biaxial stretching makes the molecules a cross shape. These [...] "crosses" [...] fit together leaving little space as more surface area is contacted thus making the material less porous and increasing barrier strength against permeation. This process also increases the strength to be ideal for filling with carbonated drinks.|$|R

Despite the presence of more than two dozen adze quarries in Hawai 2 ̆ 7 i, and previous attempts at replicating adze preforms and positing reduction sequences in Polynesia, there is no detailed study that clearly defines the steps and stages of quadrangular adze <b>preform</b> <b>manufacture</b> (the most common form in Hawai 2 ̆ 7 i), and the resulting characteristic debitage. In this paper we examine the sequence of adze production for a population of 109 adzes from Moloka 2 ̆ 7 i, documenting the transition from blanks to preforms to the finished objects that were transported away from quarries. Reduction intensity is measured using the Scar Density Index (Clarkson, 2013) calculated from 3 D scans.

40|$|Resin film {{infusion}} (RFI) is {{a cost-effective}} method for fabricating stiffened aircraft wing structures. The RFI process {{lends itself to}} the use of near net shape textile <b>preforms</b> <b>manufactured</b> through a variety of automated textile processes such as knitting and braiding. Often, these advanced fiber architecture preforms have through-the-thickness stitching for improved damage tolerance and delamination resistance. The challenge presently facing RFI is to refine the process to ensure complete infiltration and cure of a geometrically complex shape preform with the high fiber volume fraction needed for structural applications. An accurate measurement of preform permeability is critical for successful modeling of the RFI resin infiltration process. Small changes in the permeability can result in very different infiltration behavior and times. Therefore, it is important to accurately measure the permeabilities of the textile preforms used in the RFI process. The objective of this investigation was to develop test methods {{that can be used to}} measure the compaction behavior and permeabilities of high fiber volume fraction, advanced fiber architecture textile preforms. These preforms are often highly compacted due to through-the-thickness stitching used to improve damage tolerance.

40|$|Composite {{materials}} have become viable alternatives to traditional engineering materials for many different product categories. Liquid transfer moulding (LTM) processes, specifically resin transfer moulding (RTM), is a cost-effective manufacturing technique for creating {{high performance composite}} parts. These parts can be tailor-made to their specific application by optimizing {{the properties of the}} textile preform. Preforms which require little or no further assembly work and are close to the shape of the final part are critical to obtaining high quality parts while simultaneously reducing labour and costs associated with other composite manufacturing techniques. One type of fabric which is well suited for near-net- shape preforms is stitched non-crimp fabrics. These fabrics offer very high in-plane strength and stiffness while also having increased resistance to delamination. Manufacturing parts from these dry preforms typically involves long-scale fluid flow through both open channels and porous fibre bundles.

40|$|The {{high cost}} of raw materials, high labour costs and lengthy cycle times have limited the use of {{conventional}} ply-based composites in the automotive industry. This thesis seeks to identify the potential of using low cost discontinuous fibre composites (DFCs) for structural applications. Properties of DFCs are governed by the degree of homogeneity of the reinforcement and discontinuities at the fibre ends, which cause stress concentrations; thereby limiting the mechanical performance of the material. This work focuses on material characterisation of laminates moulded from discontinuous carbon fibre <b>preforms</b> <b>manufactured</b> by a robotic spray process. Through the culmination of this work, a suitable design methodology for automotive applications has been identified. Design procedures for aerospace have also been considered. An analytical model has been developed to determine the tensile stiffness and strength of a discontinuous carbon fibre preform composite. The model can be used within automotive and aerospace design methodologies to define material properties, {{but a number of}} other factors must be considered. Areal mass of the preform has been identified as the governing factor in achieving target compaction levels. Poor homogeneity in thin parts prevents the ability to achieve high volume fractions, which determines mechanical performance. It has been demonstrated that the matrix has a greater influence on the properties of DFCs when compared to continuous fibre composites. Toughened resins were particularly effective in improving tensile strength of DFCs that exhibited poor homogeneity. Damage tolerance of DFCs has been evaluated through open-hole and compression after impact testing. Higher property retention was observed compared to continuous fibre equivalents. Greater damage tolerance of DFCs could lead to increased weight-saving in structural applications. However, current safety factors based on conventional laminates may be too conservative and could lead to over-engineering thus limiting the potential of the material...|$|R

These results were corroborated by the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the (hierarchical) composites, which showed an increased storage modulus and enhanced fibre–matrix stress transfer. Micromechanical modelling was also performed on the (hierarchical) composites. By using BC as binder for short sisal fibres, added benefits such as the high Young’s modulus of BC, enhanced fibre–fibre and fibre–matrix stress transfer can be utilised in the resulting hierarchical composites...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} that bamboo and coir fibres, with an epoxy resin matrix, can be fabricated to produce unidirectional composites. A secondary aim was to demonstrate the production of intra-ply hybrids with unidirectional bamboo fibres and spread E-glass fibres. The methods explored in this work to produce the unidirectional arrays of bamboo and coir fibre preforms involved the use of a carding process to align the as-received bamboo fibres. A new method for spreading E-glass bundles or tows was developed in the author’s research group. The feasibility of using the spread E-glass fibre bundles with the uni-directional bamboo <b>preforms</b> to <b>manufacture</b> a new class of intra-fibre hybrids was undertaken. A resin infusion fabrication method was used to manufacture the uni-directional bamboo and E-glass/bamboo. Tensile testing was used to determine the mechanical properties of the bamboo and E-glass/bamboo hybrid composites. The as-fabricated cross-sections and the post-tensile tested fracture surfaces were characterised using optical and scanning electron microscopy respectively. This study developed and demonstrated a method to fabricate uni-directional arrays of bamboo and coir fibre preforms and a technique to produce intra-ply hybrid bamboo/E-glass composites. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this work}} {{is to examine the}} {{structure}} and properties of metal matrix composites obtained by infiltration method of porous ceramic preforms by liquid aluminium alloy. Design/methodology/approach: Ceramic <b>preforms</b> were <b>manufactured</b> by the sintering method of ceramic powder. The preform material consists of powder Condea Al 2 O 3 CL 2500, however, as the pore forming the carbon fibers Sigrafil C 10 M 250 UNS were used. Then ceramic preforms were infiltrated with liquid eutectic EN AC – AlSi 12 aluminum alloy. Stereological and structure investigations of obtained composite materials were made on light microscope. The mechanical properties of obtained composite material were investigated in tensile strength test and hardness test. Findings: It was proved that developed technology of manufacturing of composite materials based on the porous ceramic Al 2 O 3 preforms infiltrated by liquid aluminium alloy ensures expected structure and strength Hardness increased about twice compared to the matrix and this process can be used in practice. Practical implications: The presented metal matrix composites fabrication technology allows to obtain locally reinforced elements and near net shape products. Originality/value: Results show the possibility of obtaining the new aluminium matrix composite materials being the cheaper alternative for other materials based on the ceramic fibers...|$|R
