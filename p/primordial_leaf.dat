The data show that when grown under as nearly identical conditions as possible the primordial leaves of the mutant (tetracotyledonous) show a smaller green weight, a smaller dry weight, and a lower ratio of dry weight to green weight than those of the normal (dicotyledonous) parental race. Thus the tetracotyledonous race is distinguished not merely by striking morphological differences, but by physiological differentiation as well. In this respect the results for the heritable mutant race are in agreement with those for variant individuals within the same strain...|$|E

The investigation of shoot apex development were emphasized on {{the rate of}} <b>leaf</b> <b>primordial</b> production (plastochron interval), the rate of leaf appearance (phyllochron interval), floral initiation, floral structure and anthesis. The results revealed that the four ecotypes had the similar patterns of apex development but differed substantially in the duration and rate of each development. Sri Lanka and Surat Thani ecotypes were developed to floral initiation and progressively advanced to anthesis at approximately 273 - 300 days after planting which were more earlier than those of Ratchaburi and Kamphaeng Phet 1 (360 and 368 days after planting). All four ecotypes had similar linear relationship in the <b>leaf</b> <b>primordial</b> production with plastochron intervals of 6. 4, 6. 3, 7. 4 and 7. 6 days/primordium), respectively.

For the number of leaves on main stem, the four ecotypes performed an exponential relationship with faster leaf production at the first 150 days, thereafter the rates would slow down. In this case, Surat Thani and Kamphaeng Phet 1 had faster rates of leaf production with the maximum leaf number of 21, whereas Sri Lanka and Ratchaburi exhibited slower rate with approximately 16 - 18 leaves per plant. The four ecotypes produced tillers that fitted to the quadratic relationship by which slow tillering was observed in the early stage of development, especially in Sri Lanka and Ratchaburi, which produced only 7 - 8 tillers/plant.

40|$|One of {{the present}} major {{limitations}} of seedling production of kopyor type coconut using embryo culture is that only one seedling can be produced from a single embryo. Therefore, {{we report on the}} development of a new breakthrough technique for the production of double seedlings from a single embryo. The technique consists of four steps, viz.

40|$|ABSTRACT — Plants must {{coordinate}} the environmental conditions with internal cues {{in order to}} transition from vegetative to floral development {{at a time when}} reproductive success is likely. In this study, the association between <b>primordial</b> <b>leaf</b> growth and floral initiation in controlling that transition was examined. Maize plants grown under different photoperiod, light intensity and defoliation treatments were dissected at frequent intervals to measure the growth of exposed and unexposed leaves and determine the developmental stage of apical meristem. A gradual decrease in relative elongation rates of successive leaf primordia and unexposed young leaves was observed as plants increased in size from seedling emergence until tassel initiation. Earlier-formed leaf primordia elongated at a higher relative rate than did younger, latter-formed leaf primordia. More importantly, this gradual decrease in early stage leaf growth and the resultant accumulation of unexposed leaves in the whorl were found to be associated with floral transition. Immediately prior to tassel initiation, the length of corresponding leaf primordia in plants of the same or different treatments was similar. Treatments including photoperiod extension and defoliation that delayed tassel initiation, and shading that reduced growth were also marked by a syncronized modification of leaf primordia elongation. Floral transition occurred when the slow-down in leaf primordia elongation and the resultant accumulation of leaf primordia reached a certain level. The elongation rate of leaf primordia could regulate floral transition in maize...|$|E

50|$|The cotyledon, the <b>primordial</b> Angiosperm <b>leaf</b> {{consists}} of a proximal leaf base or hypophyll and a distal hyperphyll. In moncots the hypophyll {{tends to be the}} dominant part in contrast to other angiosperms. From these, considerable diversity arises. Mature monocot leaves are generally narrow and linear, forming a sheathing around the stem at its base, although there are many exceptions. Leaf venation is of the striate type, mainly arcuate-striate or longitunally striate (parallel), less often palmate-striate or pinnate-striate with the leaf veins emerging at the leaf base and then running together at the apices. There is usually only one leaf per node because the leaf base encompasses more than half the circumference. The evolution of this monocot characteristic has been attributed to developmental differences in early zonal differentiation rather than meristem activity (leaf base theory).|$|R

Growth and development in terms of plastochron stage, ontogenetic state, at the apex within the differing experimental treatments are examined as are {{the effects of the}} light and dark treatments. The plastochron age differs among seedlings of the same chronological age under differing treatments. Effect of the dark is to produce a delay in normal growth and development; this is concommitant with flower induction; the ontogenetic stage of induced apices in the light following the dark is dependent only on the length of the light following the dark and independent of the length of the dark; the apices of both induced and non-induced series show initially a growth spurt and much increased plastochron rate. The same processes and same hormones are required for both apices. The cells within both the induced and non-induced apices show cell enlargement followed by cell division. This involves a 2 ̆ 2 grow and divide 2 ̆ 2 message and with same content [...] for both apices. The implications for flowering theory are discussed and the concepts of induction and evocation.

Biochemical status correlates with the phase of the endogenous rhythm of which flowering acts as a marker. The thesis shows that at opposite phases of the rhythm the biochemical status does differ.

40|$|Plant cells {{exhibit a}} high rate of {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) recombination. This implies that before cytokinesis, the different mitochondrial compartments must fuse to allow for mtDNA intermixing. When and how the conditions for mtDNA intermixing are established are largely unknown. We have investigated the cell cycle-dependent changes in mitochondrial architecture in different Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cell types using confocal microscopy, conventional, and three-dimensional electron microscopy techniques. Whereas mitochondria of cells from most plant organs are always small and dispersed, shoot apical and <b>leaf</b> <b>primordial</b> meristematic cells contain small, discrete mitochondria in the cell periphery and one large, mitochondrial mass in the perinuclear region. Serial thin-section reconstructions of high-pressure-frozen shoot apical meristem cells demonstrate that during G 1 through S phase, the large, central mitochondrion has a tentaculate morphology and wraps around one nuclear pole. In G 2, both types of mitochondria double their volume, and the large mitochondrion extends around the nucleus to establish a second sheet-like domain at the opposite nuclear pole. During mitosis, approximately 60 % of the smaller mitochondria fuse with the large mitochondrion, whose volume increases to 80 % of the total mitochondrial volume, and reorganizes into a cage-like structure encompassing first the mitotic spindle and then the entire cytokinetic apparatus. During cytokinesis, the cage-like mitochondrion divides into two independent tentacular mitochondria from which new, small mitochondria arise by fission. These cell cycle-dependent changes in mitochondrial architecture explain how these meristematic cells can achieve {{a high rate}} of mtDNA recombination and ensure the even partitioning of mitochondria between daughter cells...|$|R

40|$|Of seven {{dominant}} knotted-leaf mutants tested, six mapped {{at or near}} Kn 1 on {{the long}} arm of chromosome 1, and one was not linked to Kn 1. Comparisons of phenotypes among these mutants allowed us {{to focus on a}} systematic abnormality: the parenchyma cells associated with lateral veins do not fully differentiate into bundle sheath, mesophyll or upper sclerenchyma. The more dramatic expression of Kn 1 mutants—knots, ligule alterations and twisting—is sporadic and dependent on the time when the mutant acts in leaf primordium development. Using lw to mark leaf sectors that lose Kn 1 following X-irradiation, we show that the knotted-leaf phenotype encoded by chromosome 1 L is autonomous. Analysis of sectors lacking a particular Kn 1 gene (Kn 1 -N 2) suggests that Kn 1 itself, rather than a linked modifier gene, is autonomous in the leaf primordium. Aneuploid studies using various translocations involving 1 L and marked by Adh 1 allozymes are compared. The Kn 1 mutant appears to encode a "new" function or a considerable overproduction of an extant product in the leaf. Kn 1 /- 1 L hypoploids either express knotted poorly or not at all; transvection is ruled out, but the cause for this modification of Kn 1 expression is not yet known. —Our working hypothesis is that Kn 1 mutants permit the expression of a product that is usually not produced in <b>leaf</b> <b>primordial</b> cells.

Temperature and acetosyringone (AS) effects were first studied in tobacco, as a plant model system and then applied to cotton transformation. In tobacco, AS significantly increased transformation rates that resulted in stable transformed plants. Four temperatures were evaluated during the cc-cultivation period to determine the most appropriate temperature for T-DNA transfer and integration into the plant genome. Even though 19 ?C was reported in the literature as the optimal temperature for Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer, 25 ?C was statistically significantly different as compared to 15 ?C, 19 ?C or 32 ?C and produced the highest number of transgenic tobacco plants. The superior treatments established in tobacco transformation were applied to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of the cotton shoot apex. Explant survival rates in selection medium were recorded and used to compare two temperatures (19 ?C and 25 ?C) and the effects of AS to induce the vir genes. After approximately 6 - 7 wk in selection medium, the percentage of surviving exhalants established that 25 ?C was the best temperature for cotton transformation, either with or without AS. Two wounding methods and the addition of a super-virulent plasmid were tested in cotton shoot apex transformation experiments. Their effects were evaluated using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as an in vivo reporter gene to determine the early transformation patterns.
