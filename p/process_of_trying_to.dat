2500|$|When {{someone asks}} a person a {{question}} such as [...] "What is your name?", the person automatically knows the answer. However, when someone asks a person a question such as [...] "What {{was the fifth}} dinosaur ever discovered?", the person also automatically knows {{that he or she}} does not know the answer. [...] A person knowing that he or she does not know is another aspect of metamemory that enables people to respond quickly when asked a question that they do not know the answer to.

One theory as to why this knowledge of not knowing is so rapidly retrieved is consistent with the cue-familiarity hypothesis. The cue familiarity hypothesis states that metamemory judgments are made based on the familiarity of the information presented in the cue. The more familiar the information in the memory cue, the more likely a person will make the judgment that he or she knows that the target information is in memory. With regards to knowing that you don't know, if the memory cue information does not elicit any familiarity, then a person quickly judges that the information is not stored in memory.|$|E

40|$|Inspired by {{personal}} lived experiences of mental disorder; this thesis attempts {{to explore the}} representation of these complex conditions as they are deeply embedded in trauma, guilt, and stigma. The accompanying exhibition, The Inheritance, figures my own tendencies to contain and conceal my disorder, through the assembling of sculptural containers and their disordered contents. The work, presented as something surreal, comments on the complexities of being {{a woman with a}} disorder, {{as well as on the}} disease I experience in relation to a history of patriarchal ideologies and psychiatric containment that has informed understandings of ‘female madness’. Grounded in my interests in abjection and containment, the artistic <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> express deeply personal experiences of distress allow for the resurfacing of underlying trauma, in regards to the memory of my mother’s struggle with Bipolar disorder and her subsequent estrangement. Instead of catharsis, the exhibition represents an inevitable failure to represent the unrepresentable, an experience inextricably bound to the history of gendered oppression and the repression of subjectivity by dominant powers of belief and control. Through my practice as research, I have ultimately grappled with my reluctance to represent my experience, precisely because the topic of mental disorder, though pervasive, is lived and felt by varying groups of people in different ways. As such, my intention is to avoid a reductive and narrow framing of what mental disorder entails. Similarly, I aim to avoid restrictive and presumptuous definitions of gender – recognizing that, historically, femininity is a contested category that has silenced many individuals who are not white, heterosexual or gender conforming. My literary research has been limited by these norms and silences, in that most texts detailing the historical visual treatment of disordered subjects fail to recognise the possibility of gender categories that transcend the binary masculinity and femininity. With these limitations in mind, my practice has allowed me to reflect upon the distress of generations of people who have been pathologised based on gender...|$|R

Teyla, who was held captive by Michael, gives birth to Torren John and escapes with her team, before they are able to cripple Michael. Eventually, he invades Atlantis with a commandeered Puddle Jumper to take Torren and destroy Atlantis but, thanks to the efforts of Sheppard, Teyla, and McKay, Michael is finally killed. The season also {{introduces}} a group of rogue Asgard, who unlike their Ida counterparts, actually experiment on humans to prolong their lives, and steal a device known as [...] "The Attero device" [...] to destroy the Wraith, though the side effect is that any Stargate activated after the device has been turned on will explode. The device is eventually destroyed. With the Attero device, Michael and the Hoffan drug, the Wraith have become weakened, and are no longer the power of the galaxy they once were; this gives the humans of the Pegasus galaxy freedom enough to establish a coalition. McKay falls in love with Keller, who eventually reciprocates his feelings, and they become romantically involved. In the season finale (also the series finale), [...] "Enemy at the Gate", Todd the Wraith alerts Atlantis to the fact that an underling wraith possesses a Hive Ship powered by a ZPM.
