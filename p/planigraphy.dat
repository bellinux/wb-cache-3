40|$|The spatial {{localization}} of the coenzyme FAD in the {{quaternary structure}} of the alcohol oxidase from the yeast Pichia pinus was studied by tritium <b>planigraphy</b> and ESR methods. In the present paper we measured the specific radioactivity of FAD labelled {{as a part of}} the alcohol oxidase complex. The specific-radioactivity ratio for two FAD portions (FMN and AMP) was calculated. ESR experiments show 4 A (0. 4 nm) to be the depth of immersion of paramagnetic isoalloxazines into alcohol oxidase octamer molecules. It is suggested that FAD molecules are bound to the surface of the octamer, rather than to the subunit interfaces. The orientation of the prosthetic group FAD in the alcohol oxidase protein is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of excavations at Rusenikha burial ground of Mari culture dating back to the medieval period obtained as a result of bioarcheological research. The research conducted by the authors is based on the atomic-absorption photometry method. Study of mineral composition allowed to classify the burials of Rusenikha burial mound into 2 conventional groups. The bone tissue located in burials of the first group contain exceedingly high concentrations of zinc, copper, lead and manganese with low calcium content, and low to average strontium content. Bones feature average or low mineralization. Of special interest is an individual group of skeletons with high zinc and manganese content, and very low strontium content. The differences determined on the basis of studying the mineral composition of bone tissue have been confirmed by an analysis of archaeological material: <b>planigraphy,</b> funerary rite and item inventory. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} tritium <b>planigraphy,</b> which {{provides}} comprehensive {{information on the}} accessible surface of macromolecules, allows an attempt at reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of a protein from the experimental data on residue accessibility for labeling. The semiempirical algorithm proposed for globular proteins involves (i) predicting theoretically the secondary structure elements (SSEs), (ii) experimentally determining the residue-accessibility profile by bombarding the whole protein with a beam of hot tritium atoms, (iii) generating the residue-accessibility profiles for isolated SSEs by computer simulation, (iv) locating the contacts between SSEs by collating the experimental and simulated accessibility profiles, and (v) assembling the SSEs into a compact model via these contact regions in accordance with certain rules. For sperm whale myoglobin, carp and pike parvalbumins, the λ cro repressor, and hen egg lysozyme, this algorithm yields the most realistic models when SSEs are assembled sequentially from the amino to the carboxyl end of the protein chain...|$|E
40|$|The {{etiological}} {{diagnosis of}} the third nerve palsy frequently imposes a real problem. Therefore, an attempt is made to review the different causes by studying 109 personal cases and those described in the literature. Among the 109 cases, 36 % were related to an aneurysm, 16 % to a tumor, and 12 % to vascular diseases. 27 % of the cases could not be clearly explained and were regarded as 'neuritis'. In total, sudden and isolated palsy, aneurysm is the first etiology to be considered. However {{the high incidence of}} palsies of unknown origin is striking and has been observed by other authors. The various etiological diagnoses of the third nerve palsy are also discussed, as well as the paraclinical investigations to be performed. In addition to the general and neurological examinations, analysis of the CSF, dosage of the PBI and of the glycemia, serologic tests for syphilis, edrophonium (Tensilon) and neostigmine tests, plain skull radiographies as well as frontal and posterior <b>planigraphies</b> of the cranial sinuses, must be kept in mind. Angiography and air encephalography will exclude intracerebral organic lesions. When ptosis and progressive ophthalmoplegia are associated, and myasthenia or hyperthyroidism have been exluded, myopathy must be considered and a muscle biopsy may be performed. Finally, when symptoms and signs of multineuritis are present and when expansive or vascular lesion of the brain stem has been excluded, examination of the CSF would sometimes help in the diagnosis of encephalitis.

40|$|The {{reviewed}} monograph publishes {{materials from}} 95 burials of Ust-Uzinski cemetery II {{located on the}} Upper Sura. The cemetery was left by the local early Mordvinian population in the 3 rd – 4 th centuries AD. The authors analyze the rites and grave goods and reconstruct the social stratification of the population. They suggest the chronology of the site and date the earliest grave by the 3 rd century, and the latest – by the early 5 th century. The main conclusions of the monograph are comprehensively substantiated, though some require further clarification. Judging by the <b>planigraphy</b> of this cemetery, burying activity took not more than 150 years here, and the latest graves cannot be any older than {{the first half of}} the fourth century. Social stratification was egalitarian by age and gender, which was due to a low degree of militarization of the local population. Despite the controversial nature of certain theses, the monograph is highly commendable...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} {{integrated}} archaeological and paleo-ecological {{research in the}} multilayer site Pestretsy 2 on the Mesha river (Middle Volga region) {{are discussed in the}} article. As a result of geology and geomorphology studies, it was found that cultural layers of the Bronze and Early Iron Ages occurred in the buried soil complex, which was coated by river fresh deposits formed in 19 th– 20 th centuries. According paleo-geography data, the site was situated on elevated plot in the lake-marsh basin, the basin, which radiocarbon age is about 4 thousand years ago. The site seems to be the remnants of the Late Bronze long-term settlement (at least in excavated part) belonging to so called Zaymishche cultural type as shown by stratigraphy, <b>planigraphy</b> and stone artifacts data. The shouldered arrowhead with barbs and triangular stem of the Seyma type found in this layer allows us to refer it to the 18 th– 16 thth centuries. As for the subsequent Ananyino and Azelino cultural layers, they were apparently short-term camps. Numerous faunal remains studied using archaeo-zoological methods, demonstrated animal husbandry practice houses adjoining (so called “forest”) type combined with highly developed hunting and seasonal fishing. Use-wear analysis of stone inventory confirms the authors conclusion...|$|E
40|$|The article {{considers}} the periodization of antiquities from the Andreevka burial mound {{based on a}} classification of burials into ground and inlet types. According to the author, {{the availability of the}} waste ground deposits in vicinity of the grave pit should be considered as an indicator of a ground burial. Considering the <b>planigraphy,</b> the authors identified two early and two late chronological burial groups of the Andreevka burial mound. The inventory of late burials is considerably different, which was presumably accounted for by the arrival of new population. Besides, the following Roman imported items have been discovered in late burials: wire torcs, bracelets and fibulas of the Avcissa type. These items could have been obtained {{as a result of the}} involvement of the local population in military activities against the Bosporan king Mithridates VIII (45 – 49), or during a Trans-Caucasian campaign of the Alans (72). A number os researchers synchronize the materials from the Piseraly and Klimkino burial mounds with the late burials of the Andreevka mound, although the former do not contain ancient imported items. The autors concludes that the Piseraly and Klimkino burial mounds date back to the same period as the early burials of the Andreevka mound...|$|E
40|$|Tomography or <b>planigraphy</b> is an X-Ray {{imaging system}} for {{preserving}} a certain plane of a radiography object by diffusing the other planes; however, the wanted plane does not obtain an optimum sharpness. Meanwhile, relatively nearer {{points to the}} rotating axes fixed point have lesser linear velocity than those of lying further from fixed point, consequently, Tomographic Bluring (obscuring) occur gradually, that gives rise the wanted plane to be somehow blurred that is known as "tomographic blurring", hence the clinical value of the image is diminished. This innovation could be an approach to improve current tomography systems by increasing image resolution and deep resolution and cost reduction. Micro layer tomography with benefit of fast X –Ray rotating velocity without tube movement {{has been designed to}} make images with deep resolution of millimeter fraction whilst, there is no need of digital images reconstruction instruments that allows statistical errors to fall off about zero, and high resolution images could be prepared in all planes (coronal, sagital and cross sectional. Likewise, the patient treatment and the system maintenance cost are much less by many degrees compared with those in CT scan and MRI. In this system with increasing evolution, quick operation is highly exception, hence the tomographic slices could be prepared in about less than 0. 02 second. The laboratory samples of this system have been a unique result for proving the new device preference...|$|E
40|$|The article {{characterizes the}} peculiarities of the burial ritual of Middle Sarmatian {{complexes}} from the territory of Esaulovsky Aksai river basin. On {{the basis of the}} analysis, two groups of sites having their own characteristics were allocated. The Middle Sarmatian burials Peregruznoe I, Aksai I and II have common elements with the previous period (sets of clothes, <b>planigraphy</b> of burials and others), which makes it possible to talk about their genetic continuity with Early Sarmatian culture. The data of anthropological research confirm these findings. At the same time, the Middle Sarmatian burial mounds such as Zhutovo, Ternovsky and Chikovsky represent complexes with established Middle Sarmatian funeral rites. It is not clear what caused the presence of selected features in the two groups of tombs - the previous tradition or the new elements dominating in the rite. It is unlikely that you can talk about local features resulting from the geographical environment, because the study was conducted in a small area, and remove these groups from each other is not possible. Perhaps this situation is determined by the chronological differences, but today the level of elaboration of Sarmatian chronology does not give an opportunity to identify temporary differences. Not ruled out the possibility that such a situation is determined by ethno-cultural situation in the region where the migrant mastered or abandoned cemeteries primarily certain regions of the steppe, while the local population continues to retain some territories and ancestral burial grounds at their disposal...|$|E
40|$|Many {{articles}} {{have been published}} concerning the interpretations of conventional pneumographic roentgenograms outlining the cerebral ventricles in both normal and abnormal situations. This study concerns the use of <b>planigraphy</b> in studying the ventricular system and subarachnoid spaces, and the present communication is the second dealing with the visualization of the fourth ventricle and adjacent structures. A preliminary report on this subject has been published. " Body-section roentgenography permits the visualization of definite levels through a complex structure. The principles involved have been discussed adequately by Moore, 4 Kieffer, ' Andrews,' Grossmann, 2 and Wilson. 7 With respect to the ventricular system, certain limitations exist, particularly in regard to radiographic positioning of the patient. Although the tube-film distance can be altered, {{the relation of the}} tube to the table top is relatively fixed with the Kieffer Laminagraph and all films must be taken with the patient in the supine, the prone, or the lateral position. It is not possible to obtain films in the erect position, the planigraphic mechanism being constructed on a horizontal table. To obtain adequate examination the structures to be visualized must be parallel to the table top and film. If the skull is turnedto the lateral projection, the midline structures, the fourth ventricle, the aqueduct of Sylvius, and the third ventricle can be visualized without interference of superimposed structures such as the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, the lateral ventricle, and the cerebrosubarachnoid sulci. This is also true in the postero-anterior view, where the fourth ventricle is usually obscured in conventional roentgenograms by the shadows of the frontal sinuses, of the bones of the base of the skull, and of the sphenoid cells...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the new {{attribution}} of the materials from barrow 20, excavated in 1975 near Semenovka village on the right bank of the Dniester liman, Belgorod-Dnesterovsky district, Odessa region, Ukraine. The only burial of this barrow was still considered as the monument of Babino culture (aka Multi-Cordoned Ware culture) {{of the first quarter}} of the 2 nd millennium BC. The ceramic and metal artifacts found under the barrow were considered during the study of the material culture of the Scythians of the last third of the 1 st millennium BC. The thorough analysis of the stratigraphy, <b>planigraphy,</b> funeral rite and artifacts showed that barrow 20 near Semenovka village was built instantaneously, and in fact it is Scythian. A cenotaph was the main complex of the barrow. It came with not only the armament items (iron-socketed arrowheads, spearheads and sockets of spears), horse harness (bronze frontlet with axe-shaped blade and a hook, bronze ringed beads, iron bits and iron snaffle ring, iron round pendants), glass cup, remains of the funeral feast as a ceramic breakage (Rhodes, Sinop, Cos, Cnidus amphorae, two pottery jars and molded vessel), but also with the burial of a dependent person lying crouched on his left side, his head in the eastern sector, in the catacomb. Depth of the fixing of these findings corresponded to the level of the ancient horizon on which the two-sided mainland ejected from the burial construction. Based on the Rhodes amphora marked with the eponym Άγήσιππος of - manufacturer - Έπίγονος 1, the barrow dates back to the last third or last quarter of the 3 rd century BC...|$|E
40|$|This article {{contains}} {{analysis of the}} main problems concerning social reconstruction opportunities of Early Sarmatian society according to the funeral rite. The evidence of written sources is scarce and forced to rely on just archaeological materials involving ethnographic parallels and anthropological data. The mound-specificity of the cemetery was revealed as a cemetery for the burial of the clan community. The archaeological reflection of these relations may be the presence of various burial structures (simple rectangular pits, rectangular shouldered pits, cuttings and the catacombs) {{in the framework of}} total <b>planigraphy,</b> the tradition of the position of a decedent’s body and a standard set of tools. It was concluded that the tribal groups that participated in the rituals were relatively small, because, when the Sarmatians themselves built the mound, it was usually little-sized, if they chose a ready mound, a large mound was appreciated. There were some identifiers of different social groups, including those related to higher status and retinue aristocracy. The first group includes gold, jewelry, imported utensils, ceremonial weapons, bronze caldrons. The second group stands out for a set of weapons in the form of long and short swords with the obligatory quiver. Most of the ordinary population is defined as the mass of freemen, that in case of any necessity, could turn into warriors. Not only men but also young women, and even children are sometimes found with a quiver of arrows and a sword. Female warriors should not be treated as a separate social stratum because of their fewness. At the same time, women’s participation with their husbands and themselves in attacks, raids, defense and hunting were quite common. Therefore, some women, known in society for their military success, could be observed at the burial of weapons in the accompanying inventory of the burial. The lowest cell of the traditional nomadic society was a small family, who buried their members in the chambers for collective burials. We can make conclusion about the level of the social hierarchy inherent in the society at the stage of a complex chiefdom...|$|E
