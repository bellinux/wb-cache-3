Within the root tip, auxin distribution {{plays a crucial role}} specifying developmental zones and coordinating tropic responses. Determining how the organ-scale auxin pattern is regulated at the cellular scale is essential to understanding how these processes are controlled. In this study, we developed an auxin transport model based on actual root cell geometries and carrier subcellular localizations. We tested model predictions using the DII-VENUS auxin sensor in conjunction with state-of-the-art segmentation tools. Our study revealed that auxin efflux carriers alone cannot create the pattern of auxin distribution at the root tip and that AUX 1 /LAX influx carriers are also required. We observed that AUX 1 in lateral root cap (LRC) and elongating epidermal cells greatly enhance auxin’s shootward flux, with this flux being predominantly through the LRC, entering the epidermal cells only as they enter the elongation zone.

Although the role of PIN auxin efflux transporters has been clearly assigned during embryonic shoot and root specification, the role of the auxin influx carriers AUX 1 and LIKE-AUX 1 (LAX) proteins is not well established. Here, we used chemical and genetic tools on Brassica napus microspore-derived embryos and Arabidopsis thaliana zygotic embryos, and demonstrate that AUX 1, LAX 1 and LAX 2 are required for both shoot and root pole formation, in concert with <b>PIN</b> efflux <b>carriers.</b> Furthermore, we uncovered a positive-feedback loop between MONOPTEROS (ARF 5) -dependent auxin signalling and auxin transport.

In plants, polar trafficking mediates the dynamic asymmetric distribution of <b>PIN</b> FORMED (<b>PIN)</b> <b>carriers,</b> which drive polar cell-to-cell transport of the hormone auxin, thereby generating auxin maxima and minima that control development. The Arabidopsis PINOID (PID) protein kinase instructs apical PIN localization by phosphorylating PINs. Here, we identified the PID homologs WAG 1 and WAG 2 as new PIN polarity regulators. We show that the AGC 3 kinases PID, WAG 1 and WAG 2, and not other plant AGC kinases, instruct recruitment of PINs into the apical recycling pathway by phosphorylating the middle serine in three conserved TPRXS(N/S) motifs within the PIN central hydrophilic loop. Our results put forward a model by which apolarly localized PID, WAG 1 and WAG 2 phosphorylate PINs at the plasma membrane after default non-polar PIN secretion, and trigger endocytosis-dependent apical PIN recycling. This phosphorylation-triggered apical PIN recycling competes with ARF-GEF GNOM-dependent basal recycling to promote apical PIN localization. In planta, expression domains of PID, WAG 1 and WAG 2 correlate with apical localization of PINs in those cell types, indicating {{the importance of these}} kinases for apical PIN localization.

40|$|The seed {{represents}} {{the unit of}} reproduction of flowering plants, capable of developing into another plant, and to ensure {{the survival of the}} species under unfavorable environmental conditions. It is composed of three compartments: seed coat, endosperm and embryo. Proper seed development depends on the coordination of the processes that lead to seed compartments differentiation, development and maturation. The coordination of these processes is based on the constant transmission/perception of signals by the three compartments. Phytohormones constitute one of these signals, gradients of hormones are generated in the different seed compartments, and the ratios of which constitute the signals that induce/inhibit a particular process in seed development. Among the hormones, auxin seems to exert a pivotal role; since it is the unique hormone that maintains high level of accumulation from fertilization to seed maturation. The gradient of auxin generated by its <b>PIN</b> <b>carriers,</b> affects several processes of seed development, including pattern formation, cell division and expansion. Despite the high degree of conservation in the regulatory mechanisms that lead to seed development within the Spermatophytes, remarkable differences exists during seed maturation between Monocots and Eudicots species. For instance, in Monocots, the endosperm persists until maturation, and constitutes an important compartment for nutrients storage; while in Eudicots it is reduced to a single cell layer, as the expanding embryo gradually replaces it during the maturation. This review will provide an overview of the current knowledge on hormonal control of seed development, by considering the data available in two model plants: Arabidopsis thaliana,for Eudicots, and Zea mays, for Monocots.

Different endocytic pathways are well established in yeast and animals; prominent among them is clathrin-dependent endocytosis [2, 3]. In plants, endocytosis is poorly defined, and no molecular mechanism for cargo internalization has been demonstrated so far [4, 5], although the internalization of receptor-ligand complexes at the plant plasma membrane has recently been shown [6].

Furthermore, pharmacological interference with cargo recruitment into the clathrin pathway blocks internalization of PINs and other plasma-membrane proteins.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Light plays a {{key role}} in {{multiple}} plant developmental processes. It has been shown that root development is modulated by shoot-localized light signaling and requires shoot-derived transport of the plant hormone, auxin. However, the mechanism by which light regulates root development is not largely understood. In plants, the endogenous auxin, indole- 3 -acetic acid, is directionally transported by plasma-membrane (PM) -localized auxin influx and efflux carriers in transporting cells. Remarkably, the auxin efflux <b>carrier</b> <b>PIN</b> proteins exhibit asymmetric PM localization, determining the polarity of auxin transport. Similar to PM-resident receptors and transporters in animal and yeast cells, PIN proteins undergo constitutive cycling between the PM and endosomal compartments. Auxin plays multiple roles in PIN protein intracellular trafficking, inhibiting PIN 2 endocytosis at some concentrations and promoting PIN 2 degradation at others. However, how PIN proteins are turned over in plant cells is yet to be addressed. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Using laser confocal scanning microscopy, and physiological and molecular genetic approaches, here, we show that in dark-grown seedlings, the PM localization of auxin efflux <b>carrier</b> <b>PIN</b> 2 was largely reduced, and, in addition, PIN 2 signal was detected in vacuolar compartments. This is in contrast to light-grown seedlings where PIN 2 was predominantly PM-localized. In light-grown plants after shift to dark or to continuous red or far-red light, PIN 2 also accumulated in vacuolar compartments. We show that PIN 2 vacuolar targeting was derived from the PM via endocytic trafficking and inhibited by HY 5 -dependent light signaling. In addition, the ubiquitin 26 S proteasome is involved in the process, since its inhibition by mutations in COP 9 and a proteasome inhibitor MG 132 impaired the process. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, our data indicate that light plays an essential role in PIN 2 intracellular trafficking, promoting PM-localization in the presence of light and, on the other hand, vacuolar targeting for protein degradation in the absence of light. Based on these results, we postulate that light regulation of root development is mediated at least in part by changes in the intracellular distribution of auxin efflux <b>carriers,</b> <b>PIN</b> proteins, in response to the light environment...|$|R

Current situation analysis was based on interviews and practice with operators, technicians and the production manager for the concerned department. Phase two was the design of an improvement proposal for a new way to work. It was initiated by a literature study to find ideas, possible concepts and a firmer relevant foundation of knowledge.

Cortical microtubules have been shown to reorient in response to these mechanical stresses, and to resist them, indirectly via their impact on the anisotropic structure of the cell wall. In a recent study, we show that the polar localization of the auxin efflux <b>carrier</b> <b>PIN</b> 1 can also be under the control of physical forces, thus linking cell growth rate and anisotropy by a common mechanical signal. Because of the known impact of auxin on the stiffness of the cell wall, this suggests that the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix play a crucial signaling role in morphogenesis, notably controlling the polarity of the cell, as observed in animal systems...|$|R
40|$|In Arabidopsis, lateral organ {{initiation}} {{correlates with}} {{the formation of}} an auxin maximum in a group of cells at the periphery of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). This signal establishes founder cells that build the lateral organ. Primordia initiation is closely associated with the creation of a functional boundary that separates the newly formed primordium from the remainder of the meristem. In the June issue of Plant Cell, we have characterised the JLO (for Jagged Lateral Organ) gene of Arabidopsis, a member of the Lateral Organ boundary Domain gene family. JLO is expressed in boundaries and regulates both auxin transport, via a negative regulation of <b>PIN</b> auxin export <b>carriers,</b> and meristem fate by promoting the expression of the KNOX genes SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) and BP/KNAT 1. In this Addendum, we discuss the regulation of PIN genes by JLO, and propose a model for JLO function during embryonic and post-embryonic development...|$|R
