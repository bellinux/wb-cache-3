Following protests from local businessmen regarding {{the design of the}} median, the <b>planned</b> <b>removal</b> of access to intersecting streets, and the planned changes to street parking, Governor Earl Warren wrote to the San Diego Public Safety Committee, hoping to have the dispute resolved. In November, funds were allocated to acquire land for the construction in the 1953–1954 state budget. A year later, $430,000 (about $ in [...] dollars) had been allocated to the widening project. A contract was given to the Daley Corporation to carry out the construction in 1955. The highway was to be widened to four lanes, and would add three pedestrian crossings. The completion of the widening project was announced on August 10, 1956. The final cost of the project was $850,000 (about $ in [...] dollars), with money from the City of Coronado and the state.|$|E

30|$|Radiographic {{analysis}} did {{not identify}} any impaired fracture healing or delay in <b>planned</b> pin <b>removal</b> in this cohort of healthy children with type 2 supracondylar humerus fractures at 3 – 4  weeks post-surgery. For patients who had radiographs taken after pin removal, these images showed continued stable alignment and no evidence of loss of reduction. Elimination of radiographs at time of <b>planned</b> pin <b>removal</b> would reduce cost and radiation exposure to patients while also improving clinic efficiency. Consideration {{should be made to}} eliminate completely radiographs on day of <b>planned</b> pin <b>removal</b> for children who are asymptomatic. Based on our results, more research is necessary to definitively support elimination of these radiographs; however, to minimize patient and family fear and anxiety pin removal should occur immediately after removing post-operative immobilization if continuing to order radiographs at day of <b>planned</b> pin <b>removal.</b> Current practice by the senior author is to remove pins at approximately 3 weeks post-operation and obtain a frontal and lateral view of the injured elbow after removal of pins.|$|R
500|$|Although the Spanish {{people had}} {{accepted}} foreign monarchs in the past, they deeply resented the new French ruler. On May 2, 1808, provoked by {{news of the}} <b>planned</b> <b>removal</b> to France of the last members of the Spanish royal family, the people of Madrid rebelled in the Dos de Mayo Uprising. A proclamation issued that day to his troops by Marshal Murat read: [...] "The population of Madrid, led astray, has given itself to revolt and murder. French blood has flowed. It demands vengeance. All those arrested in the uprising, arms in hand, will be shot." [...] Goya commemorated the uprising in his The Second of May, which depicts a cavalry charge against the rebels in the Puerta del Sol square {{in the center of}} Madrid, the site of several hours of fierce combat. Much the better known of the pair, The Third of May illustrates the French reprisals: before dawn the next day hundreds of Spaniards were rounded up and shot, at a number of locations around Madrid. Civilian Spanish opposition persisted as a feature of the ensuing five-year Peninsular War, the first to be called guerrilla war. Irregular Spanish forces considerably aided the Spanish, Portuguese, and British armies jointly led by Sir Arthur Wellesley, who first landed in Portugal in August 1808. By the time of the painting's conception, the public imagination had made the rioters symbols of heroism and patriotism.|$|E
500|$|Contrasted with World War I, {{there was}} {{relatively}} little violation {{of civil liberties}} during World War II. President Roosevelt was {{a strong supporter of}} civil liberties, butmore importantlythere were few anti-war activists during World War II. The most significant exception was the internment of Japanese Americans. Two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt authorized the creation of military [...] "exclusion zones" [...] with Executive Order 9066, paving the way for the detention of all West Coast Japanese Americans in inland camps. In addition to the non-citizen Issei (prohibited from naturalization as members of an [...] "unassimilable" [...] race), over two-thirds of those swept up were American-born citizens. The ACLU immediately protested to Roosevelt, comparing the evacuations to Nazi concentration camps. The ACLU was the only major organization to object to the internment plan, and their position was very unpopular, even within the organization. Not all ACLU leaders wanted to defend the Japanese Americans; Roosevelt loyalists such as Morris Ernst wanted to support Roosevelt's war effort, but pacifists such as Baldwin and Norman Thomas felt that Japanese Americans needed access to due process before they could be imprisoned. In a March 20, 1942 letter to Roosevelt, Baldwin called on the administration to allow Japanese Americans to prove their loyalty at individual hearings, describing the constitutionality of the <b>planned</b> <b>removal</b> [...] "open to grave question." [...] His suggestions went nowhere, and opinions within the organization became increasingly divided as the Army began the [...] "evacuation" [...] of the West Coast. In May, the two factions, one pushing to fight the exclusion orders then being issued, the other advocating support for the President's policy of removing citizens whose [...] "presence may endanger national security," [...] brought their opposing resolutions to a vote before the board and the ACLU's national leaders. They decided not to challenge the eviction of Japanese American citizens, and on June 22 instructions were sent to West Coast branches not to support cases that argued the government had no constitutional right to do so.|$|E

30|$|Given the {{limitations}} of this study and high number of patients receiving additional intervention after pin removal, we cannot definitively support elimination of radiographs at time of <b>planned</b> pin <b>removal.</b> Nevertheless, it was very clear that the findings on radiographs did not alter the <b>plan</b> for pin <b>removal</b> at the 3 – 4  week time point after surgery. A study by Schlecter and Dempewolf on supracondylar humerus fractures revealed similar results. Pin removal occurred, on average, 27  days after surgery, similar to the average of 23  days exhibited in this study. In no case was pin removal delayed, and no complications were noted after pin removal. Patients in their study cohort, however, did not have cast immobilization extended after pin removal. While Schlecter and Dempewolf’s cohort included type 2, type 3, and flexion type supracondylar humerus fractures, the results of their study similarly indicate that radiographic findings do not alter the <b>plan</b> for pin <b>removal</b> [11].|$|R
