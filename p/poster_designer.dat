500|$|Bich {{invested}} heavily in advertising, hiring <b>poster</b> <b>designer</b> Raymond Savignac in 1952. That year Bic won the French Oscar de la publicité award for advertising. In 1953 advertising executive Pierre Guichenné advised Bich to shorten his family name to Bic as an easy-to-remember, globally adaptable tradename for the pen, which fit in with product branding trends of the post-war era. Early Bic advertisements in France referred to the Cristal as the [...] "Atomic pen". Throughout the 1950s and 1960s the Bic Cristal's writing tip and ergonomic design helped shift the worldwide market for pens from fountain pens to ballpoints.|$|E
500|$|In May 1902, Barrymore {{was fired}} from his {{newspaper}} position after producing a poor illustration for the paper while hung over. He spent time as a <b>poster</b> <b>designer</b> but realized it was not lucrative enough for his lifestyle, which was being partly financed by Ethel, who was also paying for their father's care. While discussing his future with his brother, Barrymore said [...] "it looks as though I'll have to succumb to the family curse, acting", and he later admitted that [...] "there isn't any romance about how I went on stage.... I needed the money." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the last}} two decades - when most of the works shown here were made – the {{activities}} of the <b>poster</b> <b>designer,</b> the printmaker, the illustrator, and the film director have completed each other. Many motive, stylistic features, technical solutions appeared in all of the media and for Orosz it seemingly did not cause any problem to cross the borders of the different genres. When he was drawing a poster usually he did it with the preciseness of illustrators, when he was illustrating a book, he did it with the narrative mood of filmmakers, if he was animating films, sometimes he used the several layers approach of etchers and engravers and for prints he often chose the emblematic simplifying way of depiction of posters. If we call him only a <b>poster</b> <b>designer</b> based on his functional prints, we narrow down his field of activity, we go closer to the truth if we associate him with „postering" [...] as a way of thinking, or if we call his many sided image depicting ourselves and our age as the poster-mirror of István Orosz.

60|$|Filboid Studge {{had become}} a {{household}} word, but Dullamy wisely {{realized that it was}} not necessarily the last word in breakfast dietary; its supremacy would be challenged as soon as some yet more unpalatable food should be put on the market. There might even be a reaction in favour of something tasty and appetizing, and the Puritan austerity of the moment might be banished from domestic cookery. At an opportune moment, therefore, he sold out his interests in the article which had brought him in colossal wealth at a critical juncture, and placed his financial reputation beyond the reach of cavil. As for Leonore, who was now an heiress on a far greater scale than ever before, he naturally found her something a vast deal higher in the husband market than a two-hundred-a-year <b>poster</b> <b>designer.</b> Mark Spayley, the brainmouse who had helped the financial lion with such untoward effect, was left to curse the day he produced the wonder-working poster.|$|E
