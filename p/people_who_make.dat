5|$|Under Elijah's influence, David {{develops}} what {{he thought}} was an unusual insight into human behavior into an extrasensory perception that enables him to glimpse criminal acts committed by the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>make</b> contact with him. At Elijah's suggestion, David {{stands in the middle of}} a crowd in Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. As various people bump into him, he senses the crimes they perpetrated, such as theft and rape, and finds one he can act on: a sadistic janitor who invades a family home, kills the father, and holds the wife and their two children captive.|$|E
5|$|The Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame is a {{professional}} wrestling hall of fame that recognizes <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>make</b> significant contributions to the sport. It was founded in 1996 by Dave Meltzer, editor of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. Like other wrestling halls of fame, such as the WWE, TNA, and WCW hall of fames, the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame is not contained in a building, {{and there are no}} ceremonies for inductions other than a highly detailed biographical documentation of their career in the newsletter. Inductees include wrestlers, managers, promoters, trainers, and commentators. On seven occasions, tag teams have been inducted rather than the individual members of the team. This first occurred in 1996, when The Dusek family, The Fabulous Kangaroos, and The Road Warriors entered the hall. The Fabulous Freebirds, The Midnight Express, The Rock 'n' Roll Express and The Assassins have also been inducted as a group.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{supported}} by fishing is {{the mainstay of}} Whitby's economy in an isolated community with poor transport infrastructure and restricted by building constraints in the surrounding North York Moors National Park. The economy is governed by the changing fortunes of fishing, tourism and to some extent, manufacturing. Structural changes have led to concentrations of deprivation, unemployment and benefit dependence. A narrowing employment base and dependence on low wage and low skill sectors has resulted in younger age groups leaving the area. There are few business start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises. Older <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>make</b> increasing demands on the area's health and social care capacity have moved into the area. Demographic changes, Whitby's relative isolation from the region's main growth areas and decline in traditional employment sectors pose an economic challenge.|$|E

25|$|Conspicuous compassion, the {{practice}} of publicly donating great sums of money to charity to enhance the social prestige of the donor, is sometimes described {{as a type of}} conspicuous consumption. This behaviour has long been recognised and sometimes attacked—for example, the New Testament story Lesson of the widow's mite criticises wealthy <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>make</b> large donations ostentatiously while praising poorer <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>make</b> small but comparatively more difficult donations in private.|$|E

25|$|While the {{materials}} have changed {{and the purpose}} of many of the items have changed from religious to commercial purposes, the designs have changed little, and many retain their religious and symbolic significance.

There are some notable Huichol artists in the yarn painting and beadwork fields, and both types of work have been commissioned for public display.|$|E

25|$|According to Governing, Cities and Localities section More commonly, central cities seek ways to tax nonresidents working {{downtown}} – {{known as}} commuter taxes – as property tax bases dwindle. Taken together, {{these two groups}} of taxpayers represent a largely untapped source of potential revenue that cities may begin to target more aggressively, particularly if they're struggling. According to struggling cities, this will help bring in a substantial revenue for the city {{which is a great}} way to tax the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>make</b> the most use of the highways and repairs.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate {{program is}} {{provided}} for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; {{and people with}} disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, so <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>make</b> substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, Hal Varian {{suggested}} that the law {{could be used to}} detect possible fraud in lists of socio-economic data submitted in support of public planning decisions. Based on the plausible assumption that <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>make</b> up figures tend to distribute their digits fairly uniformly, a simple comparison of first-digit frequency distribution from the data with the expected distribution according to Benford's Law ought to show up any anomalous results. Following this idea, Mark Nigrini showed that Benford's Law could be used in forensic accounting and auditing as an indicator of accounting and expenses fraud. In practice, applications of Benford's Law for fraud detection routinely use more than the first digit.|$|E

Margaret, horrified at Suffolk's banishment, vows to ensure his return, but he is killed by pirates shortly after leaving England, and his head sent back to the distraught Margaret. Meanwhile, York has been appointed commander of an army to suppress a revolt in Ireland. Before leaving, he enlists a former officer of his, Jack Cade, to stage a popular revolt in order to ascertain whether the common people would support York should he make an open move for power. At first, the rebellion is successful, and Cade sets himself up as Mayor of London, but his rebellion is put down when Lord Clifford (a supporter of Henry) persuades the common <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>make</b> up Cade's army, to abandon the cause. Cade is killed several days later by Alexander Iden, a Kentish gentleman, into whose garden he climbs looking for food.|$|E

500|$|In {{academic}} works, {{the diversity}} of the Spectrum personnel in terms of both race and gender has been viewed highly.

500|$|The Museum of Bad Art {{has been}} used in {{academic}} studies as a standard of reference for the spectacularly awful. In one such study, published in Perspectives on Psychological Science, researchers tested the consistency of responses between people asked to make [...] "gut" [...] judgments versus those who gave conscious well-reasoned responses regarding the quality of various pieces of art. [...] The researchers showed respondents images from MOBA and New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), and asked them to rate each painting on a scale with two ends representing [...] "Very Attractive" [...] and [...] "Very Unattractive". The study found that those who reasoned in conscious thought were neither more accurate nor as consistent in their ratings. Study participants identified and rated MoMA art higher quality, but those who used conscious reasoning did not find MoMA art more attractive than those who rated with [...] "gut" [...] judgments. Furthermore, the deliberators did not find MOBA art as unattractive as those with quicker response times. The study concluded that <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>make</b> quick judgments do so more consistently, with no significant change to accuracy.|$|E

[...] Somerset's president, Colin Atkinson spoke to representatives from Worcestershire {{the day after the}} game and offered to play the match again, but his suggestion was rejected. The TCCB chairman, Carr, made a statement after the game that [...] "Somerset's action is totally contrary to the spirit of the competition, but is not in breach of the rules as they are written" [...] and announced that an inquiry would be held at season's end. However, due to the strength and volume of complaints, a special meeting of the TCCB was called for 1 June. At that meeting, Somerset were disqualified from the competition by seventeen votes to one. Only the representative from Derbyshire opposed it, with even Somerset voting for the expulsion. Due to Somerset's disqualification, Glamorgan joined Worcestershire in the quarter-finals. As it turned out, had Somerset played the game as normal, they would have qualified, as Glamorgan's match against the Minor Counties ended with no result due to rain, leaving them two points behind Somerset and Worcestershire.|$|E
