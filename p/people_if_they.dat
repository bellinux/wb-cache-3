5|$|The {{bedrock of}} E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority {{and trying to keep}} it in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of <b>people.</b> <b>If</b> <b>they</b> started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot.|$|E

25|$|Public Agenda {{has also}} concluded, however, that the public's sympathy has limits. In a 2002 {{national}} survey, the organization found 74 percent say the police should leave {{a homeless person}} alone {{if they are not}} bothering anyone. In contrast, 71percent say the police should move homeless <b>people</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are keeping customers away from a shopping area and 51percent say homeless people should be moved if they are driving other people away from a public park.|$|E
25|$|The edges may be {{directed}} or undirected. For example, if the vertices represent {{people at a}} party, {{and there is an}} edge between two <b>people</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> shake hands, then this graph is undirected because any person A can shake hands with a person B only if B also shakes hands with A. In contrast, if any edge from a person A to a person B corresponds to As admiring B, then this graph is directed, because admiration is not necessarily reciprocated. The former type of graph is called an undirected graph and the edges are called undirected edges while the latter type of graph is called a directed graph and the edges are called directed edges.|$|E

The CGO put forward six principles to counter the 12 from the Dutch.

Furthermore, any state would be free to not join RIS.|$|E

25|$|Fannie stock plunged. Some {{worried that}} Fannie lacked capital and might go bankrupt. Others {{worried about a}} {{government}} seizure. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson {{as well as the}} White House went on the air to defend the financial soundness of Fannie Mae, in a last-ditch effort to prevent a total financial panic. Fannie and Freddie underpinned the whole U.S. mortgage market. As recently as 2008, Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) had owned or guaranteed about half of the U.S.'s $12 trillion mortgage market. If they were to collapse, mortgages would be harder to obtain and much more expensive. Fannie and Freddie bonds were owned by everyone from the Chinese Government, to money market funds, to the retirement funds of hundreds of millions of <b>people.</b> <b>If</b> <b>they</b> went bankrupt there would be mass upheaval on a global scale.|$|E
500|$|A false {{translation}} of the text – affirming, among other things, {{the abolition of slavery}} and the right to self-determination, a minimum wage and asylum – has been promoted on the Internet and elsewhere. As well as making claims that are not found on the real cylinder, it refers to the Zoroastrian divinity Ahura Mazda rather than the Mesopotamian god Marduk. The false translation has been widely circulated; alluding to its claim that Cyrus supposedly has stated that [...] "Every country shall decide for itself whether or not it wants my leadership." [...] Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi in her acceptance speech described Cyrus as [...] "the very emperor who proclaimed at the pinnacle of power 2,500 years ago that … he would not reign over the <b>people</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> did not wish it". Similarly, in a 2006 speech, United States President George W. Bush referred to Cyrus, declaring that his people had [...] "the right to worship God in freedom" [...] – a statement made nowhere in the text of the Cylinder.|$|E
500|$|... is {{the second}} member of Taka {{and a member of}} the Uzumaki Clan that Naruto belongs to. She was {{originally}} from Kusagakure and later another unnamed village, but after the latter was destroyed she was taken in by Orochimaru, eventually becoming a loyal servant to him. After briefly encountering Sasuke during the Chunin Exams, she became addicted to him and decided to join Taka to be at his side. Karin was critically wounded by Sasuke during his battle against Danzo, and after he left her behind, Karin was arrested by Kakashi, in turn meeting Naruto for the first time. She later met up with Sasuke to confront him, but instead immediately forgave him. Sometime after, she seemingly moved on from Sasuke and helped deliver Sasuke and Sakura's daughter Sarada. Karin is a Sensor Type, able to sense other's chakra and feel a person's aura that way, such as seeing Naruto's chakra as [...] "bright and warm". She also can heal <b>people</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> bite her, which causes them to absorb chakra, leaving permanent marks all over her body, but due to the risks involved she can only use it once per day. In Japanese, Karin is voiced by Kanako Tōjō up until Episode 485, when Toa Yukinari takes over. In English, she is voiced by Ali Hillis except in Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where she is voiced by Michelle Ruff.|$|E

Its most important component is overall awareness of the potential black equality; no longer would blacks allow themselves to adjust themselves or comply with unreasonable white requests. This idea was based on self-confidence and political awareness. Although in the past the laws regarding equality had been ignored without consequence, Locke's philosophical idea of The New Negro allowed for fair treatment. Because this was an idea and not a law, its power was held in the <b>people.</b> <b>If</b> <b>they</b> wanted this idea to flourish, {{they were the ones who}} would need to [...] "enforce" [...] it through their actions and overall points of view.|$|E

[...] After an extensive discussion of classic Chinese novels, especially Romance of the Three Kingdoms, All Men Are Brothers, and Dream of the Red Chamber, she concluded that in China [...] "the novelist did not have the task of creating art but of speaking to the people." [...] Her own ambition, she continued, had not been trained toward [...] "the beauty of letters or the grace of art." [...] In China, the task of the novelist differed from the Western artist: [...] "To farmers he must talk of their land, and to old men he must speak of peace, and to old women he must tell of their children, and to young men and women he must speak of each other." [...] And like the Chinese novelist, she concluded, [...] "I have been taught to want to write for these <b>people.</b> <b>If</b> <b>they</b> are reading their magazines by the million, then I want my stories there rather than in magazines read only by a few." ...|$|E
