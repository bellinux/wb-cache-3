5|$|According to {{journalist}} , Enderlin's {{coverage of}} the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was respected by other journalists but was regularly criticized by pro-Israel groups. As {{a result of the}} al-Durrah case, he received death threats, his wife was assaulted in the street, his children were threatened, the family had to move home, and at one <b>point</b> <b>they</b> considered emigrating to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{sometimes}} made sudden, {{drastic changes}} to the group. On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which <b>point</b> <b>they</b> informed them that this had been merely a test. Lalich sees this as {{a way that they}} increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.|$|E
5|$|At this <b>point</b> <b>they</b> were {{superseded}} by American Quarter Horses {{needed to work}} larger cattle brought to Florida during the Dust Bowl, and population numbers declined precipitously. Through the efforts of several private families and the Florida government, the breed was saved from extinction, {{but there is still}} concern about its low numbers. Both The Livestock Conservancy and the Equus Survival Trust consider breed numbers to be at a critical point.|$|E
50|$|If an {{organization}} does {{not deal with}} young children (ages 5-8) and would still {{like to be a}} member of the program, they can gain membership through a points system that evaluates their association. They must meet at least 5 of the core criteria that Baseball Canada has set, a few of which are, having the Challenger Program for special needs children in place, a girls specific program, and hosting both umpire and coaches clinics. Based on how relevant each of these criteria are, the RBI Program awards the association <b>points.</b> If <b>they</b> meet the 5 necessary criteria but are awarded less than 10 <b>points,</b> <b>they</b> receive a bronze designation, if they are awarded 10-16 <b>points</b> <b>they</b> receive a silver designation, and if they are awarded 16-22 <b>points</b> <b>they</b> receive a gold designation.|$|R

5|$|Danvers carrots. These {{have strong}} foliage and the roots are longer than Chantaney types, {{and they have}} a conical shape with a {{well-defined}} shoulder, tapering to a <b>point.</b> <b>They</b> are somewhat shorter than Imperator cultivars, but more tolerant of heavy soil conditions. Danvers cultivars store well and are used both fresh and for processing. They were developed in 1871 in Danvers, Massachusetts. Cultivars include 'Danvers Half Long' and 'Danvers 126'.|$|E
5|$|Due to sea ice {{conditions}} and adverse weather, progress was initially very slow. By {{the end of}} October they had crossed McMurdo Sound and advanced 60miles (100km) up the difficult Victoria Land coast, at which <b>point</b> <b>they</b> decided to concentrate all their efforts on reaching the Magnetic Pole. After traversing the Nordenskjold Ice Tongue and the treacherous Drygalski Glacier they were finally able to leave the coast and turn north-west, towards the Magnetic Pole's approximate location. Before then, David had a narrow escape after falling into a crevasse but was rescued by Mawson.|$|E
5|$|Family {{tensions}} {{play out}} on the highway and at stops along the way, amidst the aging VW van's mechanical problems. When the van breaks down early on, the family learns that they must push the van until it is moving at about 20mph before it is put into gear, at which <b>point</b> <b>they</b> have to run up to the side door and jump in. Later on, the van's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself.|$|E

5|$|From an {{ecological}} perspective, raptor populations {{in urban areas}} are highly beneficial. Compared with Europe where pigeon populations have exploded to the <b>point</b> <b>they</b> are both a tourist attraction and a public nuisance. Their faeces are highly acidic causing damage to historic buildings and statues made of soft stone. They nest in bridges where it compiles and damages iron work causing rust and corrosion. In the United States, falcon and other raptors are in numbers high enough to ward off pigeon nest building in major highrises.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist {{made his}} Test match {{debut in the}} First Test against Pakistan at the Gabba in Brisbane in November 1999 {{becoming}} the 381st Australian Test cricketer. He replaced Healy, who was dropped after a run of poor form, despite the incumbent's entreaties to the selectors to allow him a farewell game {{in front of his}} home crowd. Gilchrist's entry into the Test arena coincided with a dramatic rise in Australia's fortunes. Up to this <b>point,</b> <b>they</b> had played eight Tests in 1999, winning and losing three.|$|E
5|$|In June 1944, {{units of}} the 346th Infantry Division {{occupied}} Bréville-les-Monts, a village on a watershed between the rivers Orne and Dives. From this vantage <b>point,</b> <b>they</b> could observe {{the positions of the}} 6th Airborne Division, defending the River Orne and Caen Canal bridges and beyond them the British Sword at Ouistreham. Following several German attacks on British positions from Bréville-les-Monts, the capture of the village became essential to secure the 6th Airborne Division positions and protect the Allied beachhead.|$|E

5|$|Jay Farrar, Jeff Tweedy and Mike Heidorn {{began their}} musical {{careers in the}} 1980s playing in a garage band, The Plebes. After a few gigs, {{creative}} differences between the members {{led to the development}} of a punk rock sound for the band. As punk rock was unpopular in the St. Louis region, the band changed their style to blues-rock and renamed themselves Uncle Tupelo. At this <b>point,</b> <b>they</b> stopped performing covers and began to write their own songs.|$|E
5|$|The Jamaican general {{election}} scheduled for August 27 was postponed until September 3, at which <b>point</b> <b>they</b> went ahead as planned. Opponents accused Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller of unnecessarily extending {{the state of}} emergency (and related curfews) to maintain her political control as predictions at the time suggested that she and her party would be ousted by the opposition. She and her party ultimately did lose the election, although Dean's light damage was not thought to have been a major factor.|$|E
5000|$|A and B now use {{the pair}} of <b>points</b> <b>they</b> receive {{as the basis for}} the kernel of a new isogeny. They use the same linear {{coefficients}} they used above with the <b>points</b> <b>they</b> received to form a point in the kernel of an isogeny that they will create. <b>They</b> each compute <b>points</b> [...] and [...] and use Velu's formulas to construct new isogenies.|$|R

5|$|The Rokeby Venus {{may have}} been {{intended}} as a pendant to a sixteenth-century Venetian painting of a recumbent Venus (which seems to have begun life as a Danaë) in a landscape, in the same pose, but seen from the front.

5|$|These {{processes}} use a welding {{power supply}} to create and maintain an electric arc between an electrode and the base material to melt metals at the welding <b>point.</b> <b>They</b> can use either direct (DC) or alternating (AC) current, and consumable or non-consumable electrodes. The welding region is sometimes protected by some type of inert or semi-inert gas, known as a shielding gas, and filler material is sometimes used as well.|$|E
