5|$|Historically, {{people could}} {{do little to}} protect their crops from being devastated by locusts, {{although}} eating the insects {{may have been some}} consolation. By the early 20th century, efforts were being made to disrupt the development of the insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, killing them with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with rollers and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride dieldrin was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned from use in most countries because of its <b>persistence</b> <b>in</b> the environment and its bioaccumulation in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} found that urban populations of common toad occupying small areas and {{isolated}} by development show a lower level of genetic diversity and reduced fitness as compared to nearby rural populations. The researchers demonstrated this by genetic analysis and by noting the greater number of physical abnormalities among urban as against rural tadpoles when raised in a controlled environment. It was considered that long term depletion in numbers and habitat fragmentation can reduce population <b>persistence</b> <b>in</b> such urban environments.|$|E

5|$|On January 6, 1945, Norstad visited Hansell’s {{headquarters}} and abruptly relieved him of command, replacing him with LeMay. Hansell {{was offered the}} option of commanding XX Bomber Command while it transitioned to Guam, then becoming LeMay’s deputy. Although he and LeMay were friends, LeMay had been Hansell’s subordinate in England, and Hansell declined the offer. While all the command problems factored into his relief, the main reasons were Hansell’s <b>persistence</b> <b>in</b> daylight precision attacks, reluctance to night firebombing, Norstad's view that Hansell was an impediment to instituting incendiary attacks, and a perception by Arnold and Norstad that the public relations effort by XXI Bomber Command had been unsatisfactory in preparing the American public for such attacks.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the early}} part of 1956, Cooper {{strongly}} advocated that the U.S. respect Indian nonalignment and increase economic aid to the country. In August 1956, Congress approved a financial aid package for India that included the largest sale up to that point of surplus agricultural products by the United States to any country. Cooper's <b>persistence</b> <b>in</b> requesting such aid was critical in getting the package approved, as it was opposed by many administration officials, including Under Secretary of State Herbert Hoover, Jr., Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey, and International Cooperation Administration Director John B. Hollister.|$|E
5|$|After his {{election}} to parliament in 1934, Davies was a consistent {{advocate for the}} interests of Merthyr Tydfil and the Welsh mining community. Largely indifferent to party discipline, he defied official Labour policy by championing such causes as disarmament and Welsh nationalism. His <b>persistence</b> <b>in</b> doing so brought him several suspensions from the party, and he was never offered ministerial office. An immensely popular figure locally, he was regularly returned at general elections with large majorities. In 1966, after an unstable colliery spoil tip collapsed on the village of Aberfan {{with the loss of}} 144 lives, Davies controversially stated that he had long thought that the tip was unsafe. He had not reported his suspicions, for fear that an inquiry would cause the closures of local pits. Not long after his unexpected 1970 electoral triumph, Davies died early in 1972 aged at least 85 and possibly 90 or more.|$|E
30|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that stochastic persistence for the stochastic population model has many forms of definition; for example, stochastic <b>persistence</b> defined <b>in</b> the form of distribution, or stochastic <b>persistence</b> defined <b>in</b> the form of expectation.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the detection of}} a change <b>in</b> <b>persistence</b> of a long range dependent time series. The usual approach is to use one-shot tests to detect a change <b>in</b> <b>persistence</b> a posteriori <b>in</b> a historical data set. However, as breaks can occur {{at any given time}} and data arrives steadily it is desirable to detect a change <b>in</b> <b>persistence</b> as soon as possible. We propose the use of a MOSUM type test which allows sequential application whenever new data arrives. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic and prove consistency. We further study the finite sample behavior of the test and provide an empirical application. Change <b>in</b> <b>persistence,</b> long range dependency, MOSUM test...|$|R

5|$|Saruman is in {{part the}} {{architect}} of his own downfall. Kocher, Randall Helms and Shippey write that Saruman's actions {{in the first half}} of The Two Towers, although intended to further his own interests, in fact lead to his defeat and that of Sauron: his orcs help split the Fellowship at Parth Galen, and in carrying off two of the hobbits initiate a series of incidents that lead to his ruin. In turn this frees the Rohirrim to intervene at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and then together with the men of Gondor to assault Sauron's stronghold of Mordor and distract him from Frodo's final effort to destroy the Ring. Shippey says that this demonstrates the value of <b>persistence</b> <b>in</b> the face of despair, even if a way out cannot be seen; Kocher and Helms write that it is part of a pattern of providential events and of the reversed effects of evil intentions throughout the book.|$|E
5|$|Suillus collinitus is {{the most}} {{frequent}} fungus associating with Aleppo pine – a hardy tree utilised for reforestation schemes and soil conservation against erosion in the Mediterranean region. A study performed {{in the south of}} France discovered that S.collinitus and S.mediterraneensis are multi-stage ectomycorrhizal fungi, associating with both young and mature stands of Aleppo pine. These two species may {{play a key role in}} the survival and adaptation of this species of pine on disturbed calcareous sites. Roots mycorrhizal with S.collinitus were found capable of surviving successive disturbances by fire or ploughing. Moreover, the fungus retained its viability to propagate via its mycelial network which helped the recolonisation effort of newly introduced trees. The fungus has also been shown to improve the growth of Mediterranean pines grown in greenhouses and nurseries. Unlike other Suillus species that grow in wet climates, such as S.grevillei and S.spraguei, S.collinitus does not typically produce fruit bodies in young plantations. This fruiting behaviour may be attributed to the typically nutrient-poor xeric Mediterranean environment in combination with a lack of tree canopy. The absence of above-ground indicators of fungal presence makes analysis of underground populations difficult; molecular markers have been developed to assist in monitoring fungal growth and ectomycorrhizal formation and <b>persistence</b> <b>in</b> young plantations.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} clomiphene citrates (CC) on inducing ovulation and on cyst <b>persistence</b> and size <b>in</b> women with functional ovarian cysts. Study design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: University Maternity Hospital. Subjects: 60 women in 2 equal groups. Methods: Clomiphene citrates treatment, follicle scanning, hormonal assay. Main outcome measures: Ovulation rate, pregnancy rate, cyst <b>persistence,</b> changes <b>in</b> cyst size. Results: CC increased both ovulation and pregnancy rates in women with functional ovarian cysts (56. 7 % versus 13. 3 %, p <  0. 000 for ovulation and 23. 0 % versus 6. 7 %, p <  0. 000 for pregnancy). CC also increased cyst <b>persistence</b> rate especially <b>in</b> cases achieving pregnancy (30 % versus 6. 7 %, p <  0. 000) but did not {{increase the size of}} the cyst, or cause complications in it.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} strong statistical {{evidence that}} the dividend- price ratio in the US has experienced a change <b>in</b> <b>persistence</b> from I(0) to I(1), while stock returns have not. This provides an econometric explanation why the predictive power of the dividend-price ratio in the US has changed drastically. When the dividend-price ratio is I(0), it can have predictive power for future stock returns {{by the force of}} the cointegration relation between dividends and stock prices. However, if the dividend-price ratio becomes I(1), then it should have no predictive power for stock returns which have not experienced a change <b>in</b> <b>persistence</b> and are well known to be I(0). This relation between the persistence and the predictive power of the dividend-price ratio is well observed not only in the US but also in Japan, although the underlying causes and directions of the change <b>in</b> <b>persistence</b> appear different <b>in</b> the two countries.

40|$|The {{direct and}} {{interactive}} effects of temperament and parenting {{were examined in}} the prediction of early adolescent externalising behaviour problems (conduct disorder and hyperactivity), internalising problems (depression and anxiety), and substance use, using data on 1, 402 13 - and 14 -year-olds. Significant direct effects were found for four temperament factors (negative reactivity, task persistence, activity, and approach), and four parenting factors (warmth, power assertion, physical punishment, and monitoring). For those high <b>in</b> <b>persistence,</b> low <b>in</b> negative reactivity, or low in activity, problem outcomes were generally very rare, regardless of parenting. Prevalence of behaviour problems was generally elevated among those low <b>in</b> <b>persistence,</b> high <b>in</b> negative reactivity, or high in activity, even in cases where parenting was high in positive qualities such as warmth and monitoring. Prevalence of certain behaviour problems was substantially elevated when low persistence, high negative reactivity, or high activity occurred in combination with lower parental warmth or lower monitoring. The results suggest that parenting {{can play an important}} moderating role in the relationship of particular temperament characteristics to behavioural problems. [Author abstract] <br /...|$|R
