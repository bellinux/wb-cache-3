40|$|This thesis {{describes}} synthetic {{routes to}} P-stereogenic phosphine-alkene ligands and 3 -hydroxy <b>piperidines</b> containing heteroaromatics via lithiation-trapping of phosphine boranes or N-Boc pyrrolidine. Both topics are introduced in chapter 1. Chapter 2 presents a {{route to a}} new type of P-stereogenic phosphine-alkene ligand B prepared by racemic lithiation of t-butyldimethylphosphine borane or dimethylphenylphosphine borane using s-BuLi. Different allylic halides were used to trap the lithiated intermediate to give chiral alkene-phosphine boranes A. In chapter 3, 3 -hydroxy <b>piperidines</b> were synthesised from the ring expansion of hydroxy pyrrolidines. Two novel, short and simple synthetic routes were developed (as shown below). Lithiation-trapping reaction of N-Boc pyrrolidine C using pyridine carboxaldehydes gave N-Boc pyrrolidine alcohols syn-D and anti-D. On the other hand, an alternative approach to obtain 3 -hydroxy <b>piperidines</b> anti-H starting from N-trityl prolinal E derived from (S) -proline was investigated. Addition of lithiated heteroaromatics, generated from a Br/Li exchange reaction, to N-trityl prolinal E diastereoselectively gave N-trityl alcohols anti-F. The Boc or trityl deprotection and reductive amination then gave N-benzyl pyrrolidines syn-G and anti-G. Finally, the ring expansion via an aziridinium ion of alcohols syn-G and anti-G gave 3 -hydroxy <b>piperidines</b> syn-H and anti-H. The stereochemistry of 3 -hydroxy <b>piperidines</b> syn-H and anti-H was proven using J-values in the 1 H NMR spectra...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel route to functionalized <b>piperidines</b> via a formal [3 + 3] cycloaddition reaction of activated aziridines and palladium−trimethylenemethane (Pd-TMM) complexes. The cycloaddition reaction generally proceeds enantiospecifically with ring {{opening at the}} least hindered site of the aziridine. Therefore, readily available enantiomerically pure 2 -substituted aziridines can be utilized to prepare enantiomerically pure 2 -substituted <b>piperidines</b> in good to excellent yield. The N-substituent on the aziridine proved to be crucial {{to the success of}} this reaction with only 4 -toluenesulfonyl (Ts) and 4 -methoxybenzenesulfonyl (PMBS) aziridines permitting smooth cycloaddition to take place. Additionally, spirocyclic aziridines have been found to participate in the [3 + 3] cycloaddition reaction, whereas 2, 3 -disubstituted aziridines can be applied to provide fused bicyclic <b>piperidines,</b> albeit in low yield...|$|R

25|$|The most-general {{method of}} {{asymmetric}} pyridine hydrogenation {{is actually a}} heterogeneous method, where asymmetry is generated from a chiral oxazolidinone bound to the C2 position of the pyridine.

The suggestion by Körner and Dewar was later confirmed in an experiment where pyridine was reduced to <b>piperidine</b> with sodium in ethanol.

25|$|Venom {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the ant's life as it is used to capture prey or for defence. About 95% of the venom's components are water-insoluble <b>piperidine</b> alkaloids, and it is particularly potent on sensitive humans. More than 14 million people are stung by them in the United States annually, where many are expected to develop allergies to the venom. Most victims experience intense burning and swelling, followed by the formation of sterile pustules, which may remain for several days. However 0.6% to 6.0% of people may suffer from anaphylaxis, which can be fatal if left untreated. Common symptoms include dizziness, chest pain, nausea, severe sweating, low blood pressure, loss of breath, and slurred speech. More than 80 deaths have been recorded from red imported fire ant attacks. Treatment depends on the symptoms; those who only experience pain and pustule formation require no medical attention, but those who suffer from anaphylaxis are given epinephrines.
