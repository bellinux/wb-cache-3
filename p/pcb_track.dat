40|$|The {{ability to}} predict the power {{injected}} in the pins of an IC during EM susceptibility tests is key to enable affordable and effective design of robust circuits. Radiated susceptibility tests are especially difficult to model in the circuit simulator as they involve distributed effects which do not map easily onto the nodal framework used in those simulators, where nets are inherently local. In the case of TEM fields however, usage of the transmission-line formalism is well established and allows to model the coupling effects using concepts of distributed RLCG parameters. This paper presents a simulation framework allowing to evaluate how much power is injected into <b>PCB</b> <b>tracks</b> subjected to TEM-cell fields. The proposed models were validated against 3 D EM simulations {{as well as an}} extensive series of experiments, relying on the vector network analyzer for maximum accuracy.

40|$|Much {{has been}} written about {{terminating}} PCB traces in their characteristic impedance, to avoid signal reflections. Tutorial MT- 094 presents the basic design equations for microstrip and stripline transmission lines. However, it may not be clear when transmission line techniques are appropriate. A good guideline to determine when the transmission line approach is necessary is as follows: Terminate the transmission line in its characteristic impedance when the one-way propagation delay of the <b>PCB</b> <b>track</b> is equal to or greater than one-half the applied signal rise/fall time (whichever edge is faster). For example, a 2 inch microstrip line over an Er = 4. 0 dielectric would have a delay of ~ 270 ps. Using the above rule strictly, termination would be appropriate whenever the signal rise time is < ~ 500 ps. A more conservative rule is to use a 2 inch (<b>PCB</b> <b>track</b> length) /nanosecond (rise/fall time) rule. If the signal trace exceeds this trace-length/speed criterion, then termination should be used. For example, PCB tracks for high-speed logic with rise/fall time of 5 ns should be terminated in their characteristic impedance if the track length is equal to or greater than 10 inches (wher...|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} biopotential measurement configuration utilises {{long lead}} wires which connect measuring electrodes to signal conditioning circuitry. The majority of bioelectric signals that are measured {{from the human}} body have a tiny signal amplitude (5 µV- 5 mV range) and thus any interference that is induced on the lead wires can have a detrimental effect on the original signal. In this paper, we present an alternative configuration, in which digitisation occurs on the electrode, potentially providing enhanced signal measurement as well as significant benefits {{in terms of the}} simplification of the physical interconnections between electrodes. Multiple electrodes are combined to form a digital electrode bus. This proposed topology represents the next stage in the evolution of bioelectric measurement as, due to the decrease in cost and size of integrated circuits, more of the bioinstrumentation circuitry is shifted away from a base measurement station and into the electrode itself. The prototype wireless device outlined in this paper consists of a grid of electrode nodes. By adding a circuit weighing less than 0. 45 g and with a diameter of 1. 5 cm to standard button clip electrodes, each node contains a high resolution analog-to-digital converter, and a microcontroller.

40|$|A {{composite}} CAD {{package to}} predict and reduce radiation from {{a printed circuit}} board (PCB) is presented in this thesis. The composite CAD package is implemented using an electromagnetic (EM) computation tool linked with other circuit design packages (CDPs) such as ORCAD (a schematic design package), PSPICE (a circuit simulation package) and Boardmaker (a board layout tool). Software is developed to link all the packages so that one can incorporate EMC verification in the design process of an electronic product. The well-known Numerical Electromagnetic Code (NEC) version 2 is used as an EM computation tool. In using NEC- 2 to predict PCB radiation, the PCB is simulated as a loaded thin wire structure just above (but not contacting) the surface of an imperfect ground. An algorithm is developed and implemented to automate the geometrical modelling of a wire structure for NEC- 2. The data required by NEC- 2 (geometrical, load and electrical) for prediction of PCB radiation can be obtained from various CDPs. The development and implementation of data extraction algorithms are presented in this thesis. Single and double sided PCBs can be accommodated and the work can be extended to handle multilayer PCBs. The use of NEC- 2 for this type of application has been validated experimentally and theoretically (by comparing NEC- 2 predicted radiation with that obtained where the EM radiation from a pair of parallel <b>PCB</b> <b>tracks</b> running between two components/devices is computed using transmission line modelling-TLM). Both methods of evaluation are described in detail in this thesis and results showing good agreement are presented. TLM is employed by considering, (i) the effective dielectric constant of the medium (air and substrate) surrounding the <b>PCB</b> <b>tracks</b> and (ii) the displacement current between the two <b>PCB</b> <b>tracks.</b> The effect of displacement current in near field radiation is highlighted. The use of TLM for prediction of PCB radiation is verified experimentally. Measured radiation is in good agreement with prediction. In the developed composite CAD package, one can compare the predicted radiation with the mandatory EMC requirement laid down by the regulating bodies and "close the loop" to modify the design where these requirements have not been met. Various techniques to reduce radiation can also be employed. Reduction of radiation by providing shielding in some section of the circuit is proposed. An algorithm is developed and implemented to find the section of the circuit where shielding is necessary. The optimum layout (track separation to width ratio) that can minimise radiation is found theoretically. An optimum layout is also determined experimentally and compared with the theoretical value. A good agreement is found in this comparison. Thus a guideline to choose optimum layout for minimum radiation is provided...|$|R

Gaining control of such parasitic components can enhance the overall filter performance as well as improve the accuracy of the final attenuation prediction. In this paper, a practical method for achieving inductance cancellation in filter capacitors featuring high flexibility and, at the same time, high repeatability is proposed. Thanks to the complete shielding of the coreless coupled windings the cancellation effect is not affected by ground plane proximity, providing constant equivalent parameter values. Moreover, the shield can be helpful to reduce the mutual coupling between different components of the same filter, thus enhancing the overall filter attenuation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by extensive experimental tests...|$|R

The die pads are first connected to the <b>PCB</b> <b>tracks</b> with gold or aluminium wires, utilising an ultrasonic wire-bonding machine. The dies are then coated with thermally cured epoxy. The chip-on-board (COB) is finally placed in an electrical oven for baking at certain temperature for a certain period of time, depending upon the type of epoxy used, until the adhesive is completely cured. The baking process using an electrical oven is time-consuming and costly. An alternative way of curing the epoxy is desirable searched. A variable frequency microwave (VFM) source is identified as the possible solution. The first step in curing the epoxy using VFM heating is to find out the best frequency to process the materials in microwaves and this is termed as 'characterisation' of the epoxy by the VFM oven manufacturers. Two VFM facilities were employed to perform the characterisation. One is in the frequency range of 2 – 8 GHz and the other is in the frequency range of 6. 5 – 18 GHz. By using these two facilities, the best frequency range to process an epoxy by VFM can be identified. Two high quality and commonly epoxy resins, Uniset adhesive and Hysol encapsulant were chosen for consideration. The two resins were then characterised by VFM facilities. From the graphs of the characterisation, a better resin of the two can be identified. ...|$|R
