The {{connection}} of this convective or carrying effect, which depends upon {{a certain degree}} of insulation, with conduction; i.e. the occurrence of both in so many of the substances referred to, as, for instance, the metals, water, air, &c., would lead to many very curious theoretical generalizations, which I must not indulge in here. One point, however, I shall venture to refer to. Conduction appears to be essentially an action of contiguous particles, and the considerations just stated, together with others formerly expressed (1326, 1336, &c.), lead to the conclusion, that all bodies conduct, and by the same <b>process,</b> <b>air</b> as well as metals; the only difference being in the necessary degree of force or tension between the particles which must exist before the act of conduction or transfer from one particle to another can take place.|$|E
40|$|Simulations of {{the spatial}} and {{temporal}} variability {{of the extent of}} chemically <b>processed</b> <b>air</b> in the Arctic stratosphere have been carried out using a three-dimensional chemistry-transport model for the winters of 1979 and 1989. Chemically <b>processed</b> <b>air</b> is identified in the model as that in which the amounts of hydrogen chloride (HCl) calculated with parameterized loss for conditions appropriate to polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) formation are substantially smaller than those calculated in a model with gas phase chemistry only. It is seen that chemically <b>processed</b> <b>air</b> may be identified over much of the Arctic lower stratosphere from early January to late February, with HCl depletions being larger in 1989 than in 1979. Near the latitude of the Arctic circle, there is important {{spatial and temporal}} variability in the extent of chemically <b>processed</b> <b>air.</b> There is some evidence for transport to midlatitudes of <b>processed</b> <b>air</b> during these winters, but the HCl reductions are much smaller and more sporadic than those near the pole.

40|$|Three-dimensional model {{simulations}} {{are used}} to describe the January 31, 1989 ozone minihole over Stavanger, Norway. This minihole is typical of many transient events in the lower stratosphere that arise because of cyclonic-scale disturbances in the troposphere. Although the ozone reduction is a short-lived reversible dynamical event, through heterogeneous chemical processes there can be a significant transfer of chlorine from reservoir molecules to active radicals. This chemically perturbed air is defined as <b>processed</b> <b>air,</b> and it is found that a single event can produce enough <b>processed</b> <b>air</b> to reduce the HCl in the entire polar vortex. Chemical processing on clouds associated with transient events is shown to be a major source of <b>processed</b> <b>air</b> in the polar vortex in December before background temperatures are cold enough for more uniform heterogeneous conversion...|$|R

40|$|Early in December 1991, high {{values of}} ClO are {{seen by the}} Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite at latitudes south of areas of {{temperatures}} cold enough to form polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). A 3 D simulation shows that the heterogeneous conversion of chlorine reservoirs to reactive chlorine on the surfaces of PSCs (processing) takes place at high latitudes. Often the <b>processed</b> <b>air</b> must be transported to lower latitudes, where the reactive chlorine is photochemically converted to ClO, to be observed by MLS. In this simulation, one incidence of cold temperatures is associated with an anticyclone, and a second with a cyclone. The transport of <b>processed</b> <b>air</b> associated with the anticyclone is marked by shearing; {{a decrease in the}} maximum of the <b>processed</b> <b>air</b> is accompanied by growth of the area influenced by the processing. In contrast, the <b>air</b> <b>processed</b> in the cyclonic event spreads more slowly. This shows that transport and shearing is a crucial element to the evolution of reactive chlorine associated with a processing event. In particular, transport and shearing, as well as photochemical processes, can cause variations in observed ClO...|$|R
