50|$|A {{mechanical}} system consists of (i) a power source and actuators that generate forces and movement, (ii) {{a system of}} mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement, and (iii) a controller with sensors that compares the output to a performance goal and then directs the actuator input. This {{can be seen in}} Watt's steam engine (see the illustration) in which the power is provided by steam expanding to drive the piston. The walking beam, coupler and crank transform the linear movement of the piston into rotation of the output pulley. Finally, the pulley rotation drives the flyball governor which controls the valve for the steam input to the <b>piston</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{case the}} {{retracted}} {{length of the}} cylinder is too long for the cylinder {{to be built in}} the structure, Telescopic cylinder can be used. One has to realize that for simple pushing applications telescopic cylinders might be easily available; for higher forces and/or double acting cylinders, they must be designed especially and are very expensive. If hydraulic cylinders are only used for pushing and the piston rod is brought in again by other means, one can also use Plunger cylinders. Plunger cylinders have no sealing over the piston, if the piston even exists. This means that only one oil connection is necessary. In general the diameter of the plunger is rather large compared with a normal <b>piston</b> <b>cylinder,</b> whereas a hydraulic motor will always leak oil. A hydraulic cylinder does not have a leakage over the piston nor over the cylinder head sealing so that {{there is no need for}} a mechanical brake.|$|E

5000|$|The M47TUD20 {{introduced}} new common failure points. Chief {{among these}} {{was a new}} 'swirl flap' mechanism embedded in the inlet manifold. This consisted {{of a number of}} butterfly valves within each individual inlet tract, which are secured to an actuating rod via two small screws. It has become clear that over time these screws can come loose via vibration etc. When this happens they can end up being drawn into the respective cylinder, causing significant damage to <b>piston,</b> <b>cylinder</b> head and valves. If unlucky further damage can be caused to the turbo if the screw then makes its way through the exhaust valve into the manifold and subsequently into the turbo. These failures have occurred in such quantity that a number of specialist BMW magazines have featured articles on the problem including information on how to remove the swirl flaps. [...] For those who wish to perform some preventive maintenance on the M47TUD20 engine, there are companies who supply and/or fit blanking plugs to allow the removal of these swirl flaps altogether. BMW addressed the problem by introducing stronger swirl flaps and larger diameter spindles - made from plastic - in 2006.|$|E
50|$|The {{maximum amount}} of power {{generated}} by an engine {{is determined by the}} {{maximum amount of}} air ingested. The amount of power generated by a piston engine is related to its size (cylinder volume), whether it is a two-stroke engine or four-stroke design, volumetric efficiency, losses, air-to-fuel ratio, the calorific value of the fuel, oxygen content of the air and speed (RPM). The speed is ultimately limited by material strength and lubrication. Valves, pistons and connecting rods suffer severe acceleration forces. At high engine speed, physical breakage and piston ring flutter can occur, resulting in power loss or even engine destruction. Piston ring flutter occurs when the rings oscillate vertically within the piston grooves they reside in. Ring flutter compromises the seal between the ring and the cylinder wall, which causes a loss of cylinder pressure and power. If an engine spins too quickly, valve springs cannot act quickly enough to close the valves. This is commonly referred to as 'valve float', and it can result in piston to valve contact, severely damaging the engine. At high speeds the lubrication of <b>piston</b> <b>cylinder</b> wall interface tends to break down. This limits the piston speed for industrial engines to about 10 m/s.|$|E
40|$|The <b>piston</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{apparatus}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} versatile instruments operating in laboratories of experimental petrology because it provides a safe, inexpensive, and easy-to-use technique for accessing high-pressure and high-temperature phases and processes. The operating pressure of the <b>piston</b> <b>cylinder</b> usually ranges between 0. 5 and 5 GPa, which allows Earth scientists to investigate materials and processes occurring at deep crustal to upper mantle levels. Incomplete compaction of the assembly and thermocouple failure are typical problems in experiments performed at pressures lower than 0. 5 GPa. We have demonstrated that, using proper assemblies, <b>piston</b> <b>cylinder</b> apparatus can effectively be used at pressure as low as 150 MPa. At this purpose, we have developed and tested a new 25 mm furnace assembly, made up of crushable MgO, borosilicate glass and NaCl. Calibration of the new assembly yielded to a significant increase of correction at lower pressure (an additional correction + 60 MPa is required when operating at 150 MPa). With the aim to further decrease the operative pressure limit of <b>piston</b> <b>cylinder</b> below 150 MPa, we are testing a new “softer” assembly, in which the MgO sample holder has been replaced with a mixture of NaCl and KCl. The use of the softer material allows a better compaction of the assembly, maintaining an hydrostatic regime even for lower hydraulic pressure. Nevertheless, the softening/melting of the salt decreases the resistivity of the assembly, implying a higher operation current. This problem can be worked out by insulating the sample holder salt from the graphite furnace. The major advantage of using the new design 25 mm assemblies in the <b>piston</b> <b>cylinder</b> apparatus is that experiments for which low-pressure conditions as well as very fast heating and quenching rates are required (e. g. volcanic and hydrothermal systems), can be performed with the same ease and precision as for the pressure ranges for which piston cylinders are routinely employed...|$|E

In this work, we present new calibration data that demonstrates that the <b>piston</b> <b>cylinder</b> apparatus is suitable for experiments at pressure as low as to 150 MPa. Two new designs for the 25 mm assembly have been developed and calibrated using two different calibration methods: the NaCl melting curve and the solubility of H 2 O in albite and rhyolite melts. NaCl calibration data shows that positive friction corrections of 45, 55, and 60 MPa applied to the force of the piston are necessary to establish sample pressures of 300, 200, and 150 MPa respectively. The H 2 O solubility experiments in albite and rhyolite not only confirm the corrections determined using the NaCl calibration method, but also indicate that the friction correction is the same even when operating at temperatures higher than 800 °C and for 24 -hour durations. The accuracy of the pressure estimate associated with the calibration methods is ± 25 MPa.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a first order analysis of {{four types of}} overdriven free-displacer Stir-ling machines. All the presented types of machines can work as refrigerating machines, prime movers or heat exchange accelerators depending on parameters such as the hot to cold source temperatures ratio, the nondimensional mass of working gas in the ma-chine, the displacer rod to displacer cross sectional area ratio, the corrected dead space to <b>piston</b> <b>cylinder</b> volume ratio and the displacer to <b>piston</b> <b>cylinder</b> volume ratio. In its analytical form this theory holds for machines at low speed as {{it is assumed that}} the piston displacement can be neglected during the displacer movement duration.

The preliminary design of a Ringbom prime mover is then presented. The main pa-rameters influences are predicted and the magnitude of work, rotational speed limit and efficiency are obtained...|$|E
