50|$|The <b>pre-litigation</b> <b>stage</b> {{involves}} certain preliminary enquiries: into, for example, {{whether there}} {{is in fact a}} case, the kind of action to be taken, the identity of the person against whom it is to be pursued, for how much, by whom, and in which court—everything, that is, which must occur prior to the point at which a dispute is actually referred to a court. It may also involve correspondence with an opponent and the sending of a letter of demand.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{a variety}} of reasons - ranging from {{misinformation}} and lack of awareness among people as to what the Lok Adalat was for, lack of knowledge and capacity {{on the part of the}} Lok Adalat benches to deal with the cases properly, and even intimidation of complainants against approaching Lok Adalats with their grievances, Lok Adalats often have limited results. Arguably, many of these problems in implementation could be addressed with some attention to detail, and a commitment to results on the part of the authorities. In theory Lok Adalats still remain a possible option to serve as a platform for solving cases at the <b>pre-litigation</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} get over the major {{drawback}} in the existing scheme of organisation of Lok Adalats under Chapter VI of the Legal Services Authorities Act 1987, in which if the parties do not arrive at any compromise or settlement, the unsettled case is either returned to the back to the court or the parties are advised to seek remedy in a court of law, which causes unnecessary delay in dispensation of justice, Chapter VI A was introduced in the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, by Act No.37/2002 with effect from 11-06-2002 providing for a Permanent Lok Adalat to deal with pre-litigation, conciliation and settlement of disputes relating to Public Utility Services, as defined u/sec.22 A of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, at <b>pre-litigation</b> <b>stage</b> itself, which would result in reducing the work load of the regular courts to a great extent.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} whether evidential {{and procedural}} issues identified {{in relation to}} public family law assessment {{can be used to}} further understanding of the Child Death Review Process, an under-researched but important process of statutory family assessment. <b>Pre-litigation</b> <b>stages</b> of family investigation, particularly in relation to child protection and safeguarding assessments undertaken within the framework for the assessment of children in need are set out in Working Together to Safeguard Children. The Child Death Review Process, also in Working Together to Safeguard Children is applied in cases of sudden unexpected deaths in infancy (SUDI cases). Assessment of bereaved parents is particularly sensitive and highlights the problems of mixing investigatory assessment with measures intended to be supportive. This paper questions the function of the Child Death Review Process asking whether it forms part of a drift towards increasingly intrusive state surveillance of families and particularly parents. If it falls into this category issues common to both types of assessment have ramifications for decision making, including decisions made by courts in subsequent public family law or criminal proceedings...|$|R
40|$|Proponents of {{environmental}} regulation have catalogued various strategies used by takeholders to delay or weaken regulatory efforts, including (1) manufacturing or magnifying uncertainty; (2) demanding “sound science” (and thereby imposing unreasonable standards of evidence); and (3) data quality initiatives that permit deconstruction of credible studies by highlighting inevitable assumptions, funding sources, and areas for further research. Such strategies can be termed “idealizations” of science {{insofar as they}} rely on an unrealistic image of good science as somehow capable of avoiding tentative conclusions, institutional interests, consensual assumptions, {{and the need for}} further research. The question remains, however, when does an argument based on scientific uncertainty reflect a valid concern, and when is such an argument merely strategic? This Article is based on a study that was structured to identify whether and how arguments and challenges based on idealizations of science were used in the initial (<b>pre-litigation)</b> <b>stages</b> of several Philadelphia-area water quality controversies. The purpose of this Article is to describe the results of our study, including our sense that idealized arguments, at least {{in the early stages of}} TMDL disputes, are not very effective...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} whether evidential {{and procedural}} issues identified {{in relation to}} public family law social work assessment of families {{can be used to}} further understanding of the Child Death Review Process. The Process is an under-researched but important aspect of statutory family assessment. <b>Pre-litigation</b> <b>stages</b> of family assessment, particularly in relation to child protection and safeguarding are undertaken within the Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and their Families, set out in Working Together to Safeguard Children. The Child Death Review Process, also in Working Together to Safeguard Children is applied in cases of child deaths categorised as ‘sudden’ and ‘unexpected’. Assessment of bereaved parents is particularly sensitive and highlights the problems of mixing investigatory assessment with measures intended to be supportive. This paper questions the function of the Child Death Review Process, asking whether it forms part of a drift t owards increasingly intrusive state surveillance of families and particularly parents, or is an attempt to ‘work together’ with parents following bereavement. If it is an investigatory process there are ramifications for subsequent decision making, including decisions made by courts in public family law or criminal proceedings. A clearer framework for assessment and inclusion of parents as part of (as opposed to subjects of) the process is indicated. Alternatively the process should be removed from Working Together and carried out within the criminal justice framework, the public health framework and the Coroner’s framework...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{mobilisation}} of law by Ukrainian {{business people}} at the <b>pre-litigation</b> <b>stage</b> of disputes, when litigation has not as yet been commenced but a legal claim has been formalised through the pretenziya - a formal letter to the delinquent party written to a special template. In Soviet times the pretenziya was by law an obligatory prerequisite before filing a claim in a commercial court (arbitrazh), but nowadays it is optional. Having analysed the spectrum of legal and extra-legal functions of pretenziya, this paper concludes that due to its adaptability, pretenziya proved capable of operating both as a token of the public order – the ‘shadow of the law’ - {{and as part of}} a private contract enforcement. Pretenziya in a voluntary form has not only survived in market-oriented economy but even opened up new avenues for the creative use of legal forms in post-Soviet business...|$|E
