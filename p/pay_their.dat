5|$|In 1774, the {{government}} of Prince Edward Island passed the Quit Rent Act 1774 to force the proprietors to <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> dues to maintain civil infrastructure on the island. However, many proprietors continued to simply not <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> quitrent. In 1781, {{the government}}, led by Governor Walter Patterson, compulsorily acquired {{approximately half of the}} island using a process known as escheat. That same year, the government held a public auction to sell off the land that had been compulsorily acquired. However, following a concerted effort by the proprietors to get the Colonial Office to reverse the action, the Crown overturned the sales conducted at the auction in 1783. The proprietors requested that Governor Patterson be removed from his office, and the Colonial Office did so in 1786.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{concerns}} of the Irish discussed in the first letter was over what is now known as Gresham's law: debased coins would cause silver and gold coinage to be hoarded or removed from the country, which would further debase the currency. Tenant farmers would {{no longer be able to}} <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> landlords, and, after the tenants were removed, there would be fewer crops grown in Ireland; the increase of poverty and the decrease of food supply would completely ruin Ireland's economy.|$|E

The Jones family owned the house until 1933 (and notably added a kitchen which created the west wing of the house); thus, it was the Jones family who allowed Grant Wood to use their home as a backdrop for American Gothic.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the {{recession}} which began in 1893, and which continued through 1896, ruined many Americans. Contemporary estimates were an unemployment rate as high as 25%.

Some of the impoverished died of disease or starvation; others killed themselves.|$|E
