5|$|In {{the waiting}} lounge, Tara {{approaches}} Shiv, believing {{him to be}} a doctor, and asks for his advice. He reveals that his wife had a stroke eight months ago while he was out watching a cricket match, and has been in a coma ever since. The two bond over their similar situations. Later, Girish drops Tara off at a hotel and gives her Rajat's bag. Tara finds his watch in it and <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> next day she is angered after reading an intimate message on Rajat's phone from a colleague Sheetal, who is later revealed to be a man. Shiv witnesses the whole misunderstanding, and the two share a light moment. He later visits her at the hotel, and she shares her disappointment with her friends and followers on social media for having abandoned her. She commends Shiv for his composure, as he explains the five stages of grief to her.|$|E
25|$|Fergus {{is upset}} when he can't find any baby {{pictures}} {{of him in the}} family album. He storms off to the attic and goes through the mirror. Mandy finds a picture of him as a baby, and <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mirror for him to see. When Fergus comes back through the mirror it transforms him into the baby version of himself in the photograph. The children do {{not know what to do}} and send him back through where he is found by Violette. Constance tells the other that her mother found him and they try to get him back. They realise they must find a more recent picture of Fergus. They decide to use the picture which had been taken that morning. They return through the mirror and Fergus is restored to his teenage self, unaware of what had happened.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{having been}} {{impressed}} with the cast, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote that [...] "Teen romance and operetta-style singing replace the horror elements familiar to film-goers, and director Joel Schumacher obscures any remnants of classy stage spectacle with the same disco overkill he brought to Batman Forever." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com believed that Phantom of the Opera [...] "takes everything that's wrong with Broadway and <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> big screen in a gaudy splat." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{important}} {{song that}} Berlin wrote during his transition from writing ragtime to lyrical ballads was [...] "A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody," [...] which {{became one of}} Berlin's [...] "first big guns," [...] says historian Alec Wilder. The song was written for Ziegfeld's Follies of 1919 and became the musical's lead song. Its popularity {{was so great that}} it later became the theme for all of Ziegfeld's revues, and the theme song in the 1936 film The Great Ziegfeld. [...] Wilder <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same level as Jerome Kern's [...] "pure melodies," [...] and in comparison with Berlin's earlier music, says it's [...] "extraordinary that such a development in style and sophistication should have taken place in a single year." ...|$|E

6000|$|WAITER (placing {{the tray}} {{temporarily}} on the centre table). I thought so, ma'am. Curious how the nerves seem {{to give out}} in the afternoon without a cup of tea. (He fetches the tea table and places {{it in front of}} Mrs. Cladon, conversing meanwhile.) the young lady and gentleman have just come back, ma'am: they have been out in a boat, ma'am. Very pleasant on a fine afternoon like this---very pleasant and invigorating indeed. (He takes the tray from the centre table and <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tea table.)

He turns to the sergeant, who is approaching him with a pair of handcuffs hidden behind him, and says lightly) Did you ever arrest a man of my cloth before, Sergeant? ...|$|E

In this uneasy attitude and in others, at various places without and within, Mayor Petion harangues; many men harangue: finally Commandant Santerre defiles; passes out, with his Sansculottism, by {{the opposite side of the}} Chateau.
