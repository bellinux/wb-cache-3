40|$|This thesis explores how {{truckload}} carriers use conditional bids {{within the}} framework of a combinatorial auction to win more business and balance their existing networks. Because a considerable portion of a truckload carrier's cost of serving a given lane is associated with the probability of finding a follow-on load (i. e. economies of scope), bidding on a lane-by-lane basis may not accurately reflect a carrier's true cost of serving that lane. In a combinatorial auction, a truckload carrier can more accurately reflect its true cost of serving a given lane by offering <b>package</b> <b>discounts,</b> conditional on winning lanes that increase the probability of finding follow-on loads. Though a considerable amount {{has been written about the}} economics of truckload carrier's operations and the benefits of combinatorial auctions to shippers, few have studied conditional bidding from a bidder's (carrier's) perspective. This thesis makes three contributions. First, an explanation of why bidders do and don't submit conditional bids in combinatorial auctions is provided. Second, a model of carrier costs functions, including <b>package</b> <b>discounts</b> (a measure of economies of scope) is developed. Finally, this thesis examines regional pricing differences, and quantifies the amount by which carriers will change their prices in different regions of the US. by Clinton Lee Plummer. Thesis (M.

40|$|The {{success of}} the Areeda-Turner test for predatory pricing and the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{adoption}} of demanding proof requirements in its 1993 Brooke Group decision have made {{it very difficult for}} plaintiffs to win conventional predatory pricing claims. While many challenges to exclusionary pricing continue to be made, the legal theory has evolved away from classical predation to a variety of other theories. These include challenges to quantity and market share discounts, single item and <b>package</b> <b>discounts,</b> and various purchasing practices, including slotting fees, overinvestment in fixed cost assets, and overbuying of variable cost inputs. Plaintiffs have enjoyed somewhat greater success with these alternative theories, in large part because the practices are not as well understood as conventional price predation is.

40|$|Combinatorial {{procurement}} auctions are desirable as they enable bidding {{firms to}} pass their potential cost synergies {{on to the}} procuring entity and {{may lead to a}} reduction in cost for the procuring entity and enhancing efficiency. However, an assessment of the benefits of the combinatorial mechanism, based on the observed <b>package</b> <b>discounts,</b> is likely to overstate the true cost savings generated by the mechanism. The option for a firm to submit bids on bundles of contracts gives rise to a strategic effect because a firm’s stand-alone bids compete with its package bids. Therefore, bidders might find it profitable to inflate their stand-alone bids in order to favour their package bids. Using data from first-price procurement auctions of single and multiple contracts, with and without the option to submit package bids, we find that firms inflate their stand alone bids in the combinatorial auctions compared to their corresponding bids in standard first-price procurement auctions. Further, the analysis does not show significant differences in the procurer’s cost by type of auction. Combinatorial procurement auctions; Contract bidding...|$|R

One such tool is sales teams’ initiatives or promotional policies, i.e., free gifts, <b>discounts,</b> <b>packaging,</b> etc. This phenomenon motivates the retailer/or buyer to order a large inventory lot so as to take full benefit of promotional policies. In view of this the present paper considers a two-warehouse (owned and rented) inventory problem for a non-instantaneous deteriorating item with inflation and time value of money over a finite planning horizon. Here, demand depends on the sales team’s initiatives and shortages are partially backlogged at a rate dependent on the duration of waiting time up {{to the arrival of}} next lot. We design an algorithm to obtain the optimal replenishment strategies. Numerical analysis is also given to show the applicability of the proposed model in real-world two-warehouse inventory problems.|$|R

40|$|Generating {{government}} revenue {{is a common}} objective in privatization. This paper asks: what determines privatization prices? Pursuing this query helps resolve the current controversies about the bearing of speed and the role for government actions prior to privatization. The data, gathered from primary sources, encompass 361 privatized Mexican companies in 49 four-digit industry codes. The determinants of auction privatization prices are divided into three groups: (1) company performance and industry parameters; (2) the auction process and its requirements; and (3) the prior restructuring actions taken by the government. Controlling for company and industry effects reveals the significant impact of the costs and characteristics of the labor force. Minority control <b>packages</b> carry large <b>discounts.</b> Auction requirements that allow foreign investors result in higher sale premia, while restrictions constraining participation or payment forms reduce net prices. The speed of privatization substantially influences net prices: the longer it takes to put the company on the block, the more severe the deterioration in performance, and the lower the premium obtained. Pre-sale reductions in labor force, and particularly the firing of CEOs, lead to significantly higher premiums. Debt absorption, investment, and performance improvement programs do not increase the net price, while de-investment measures prove more beneficial. Overall, the results show increased premia for government actions that stimulate bidder participation and expedite the privatization process. ...|$|R

As a partial {{response to these}} problems, the hotel industry has made significant changes in methods used to quote room prices and {{in the sale of}} its rooms through central or local reservation systems. To maximize revenue, many hotels have implemented yield management systems that adjust "room rates in response to the level of rooms booked for future arrival dates " (Relihan, 1989). Computer systems, sales incentive programs, and the retraining of reservation personnel and others are necessary in order to produce "the best possible return, or yield, from the space available " (Relihan, 1989). While the hotel management is attempting to boost revenues, they may be simultaneously and actively promoting discount programs to attract weekend guests, seniorcitizens, corporate accounts, government contracts, and families.

Domestic tourism involves locals visiting fun places, holiday destinations and entertaining centers for their own relaxation or fun activities within the national boundaries. The locals may decide to visit such places {{to get away from the}} usual pressure associated with work, monotony of daily living and time to bond with the family. Domestic tourism has seen a significant increase that has been caused by several external influences that have impacted on the consumers. Several organizations, both public and private sectors have encouraged domestic tourism by giving incentives to persons interested. In this paper data was collected from the print media. The aim of the study is to identify the means, in which commercial airlines use to reach the domestic tourist as well as ways that commercial airlines use to promote domestic tourism in Kenya. The study concluded that commercial airlines have largely employed print media to communicate to the consumers the following; reduction of fares, increased frequency of specific routes, and introduction of new routes. The advertisements are especially heavy during the period following long holidays, which shows that the airlines are appealing to the consumers who are working to take advantage of the period and travel to a different destination to unwind and also spend time with the family.

40|$|The recent {{development}} of the Fayetteville Shale Play, an unconventional natural gas reservoir in Central and Eastern Arkansas, has created considerable opportunities for {{the state and its}} citizens as the industry has made substantial investment in the region. These developments have resulted in thousands of new jobs for Arkansans, billions of dollars in direct and indirect output, and millions in state and local tax revenues. One of the most visible issues in recent state news has been the controversy surrounding the severance tax levied by the state government on the extraction of natural gas. The question at hand has been whether or not to increase Arkansas 2 ̆ 7 s rate. The state has had the lowest severance tax incidence in the nation causing many to speak out for a raise in the tax rate to something comparable to surrounding states in the region. These demands caught the attention of Arkansas Governor Beebe who worked with natural gas companies to find a reasonable severance tax <b>package</b> including some <b>discounts</b> for shale play wells. The legislature shortly thereafter approved this increase to be enacted January 1, 2009. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the state 2 ̆ 7 s reaction to these recent events and offer any additional recommendations that may enhance this set of decisions. A comparison of Arkansas Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas was conducted on multiple levels of economic conditions to evaluate the overall tax structure within each state. Outside research was also considered in forming these conclusions. After completing an extensive cross-state comparison and incorporating econometric research, it was determined that the Arkansas state legislature was justified in increasing the severance tax rate. However, the rationale for tax increases - specifically the reasoning that other states have higher severance tax rates - is somewhat flawed based on consideration of economic conditions, natural gas production numbers, and overall tax structures. A stronger rationale lies in additional research that suggests that an increase in liabilities for severance taxes yields minor changes in investment and drilling activity and potentially positive economic rewards...|$|R
40|$|The main {{advantage}} of a procurement combinatorial auction (CA) {{is that it allows}} suppliers to express cost synergies through package bids. However, bidders can also strategically take {{advantage of}} this flexibility, by <b>discounting</b> <b>package</b> bids and "inflating" bid prices for single-items, {{even in the absence of}} cost synergies; the latter behavior can hurt the performance of the auction. It is an empirical question whether allowing package bids and running a CA improves performance in a given setting. Analyzing the actual performance of a CA requires evaluating cost efficiency and the margins of the winning bidders, which is typically private and sensitive information of the bidders. Thus motivated, in Chapter 2 of this dissertation, we develop a structural estimation approach for large-scale first-price CAs to estimate the firms' cost structure using the bid data. To overcome the computational difficulties arising from the large number of bids observed in large-scale CAs, we propose a novel simplified model of bidders' behavior based on pricing package characteristics. Overall, this work develops the first practical tool to empirically evaluate the performance of large-scale first-price CAs commonly used in procurement settings. In Chapter 3, we apply our method to the Chilean school meals auction, in which the government procures half a billion dollars' worth of meal services every year and bidders submit thousands of package bids. Our estimates suggest that bidders' cost synergies are economically significant in this application (~ 5 %), and the current CA mechanism achieves high allocative efficiency (~ 98 %) and reasonable margins for the bidders (~ 5 %). We believe this is the first work in the literature that empirically shows that a CA performs well in a real-world application. We also conduct a counterfactual analysis to study the performance of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism in our empirical application. While it is well known in the literature that the VCG mechanism achieves allocative efficiency, its application in practice is at best rare due to several potential weaknesses such as prohibitively high procurement costs. Interestingly, contrary to the recent theoretical work, the results show that the VCG mechanism achieves reasonable procurement costs in our application. Motivated from this observation, Chapter 4 addresses such apparent paradox between the theory and our empirical application. Focusing on the high procurement cost issue, we study the impact of competition on the revenue performance of the VCG mechanism using an asymptotic analysis. We believe the findings in this chapter add useful insights for the practical usage of the VCG mechanism...|$|R
