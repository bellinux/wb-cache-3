25|$|When a {{large number}} of crystallographic defects bind these planes together, {{graphite}} loses its lubrication properties and becomes what is known as pyrolytic graphite. It is also highly anisotropic, and diamagnetic, thus it will float in mid-air above a strong magnet. If it is made in a fluidized bed at 1000–1300°C then it is isotropic turbostratic, and is used in blood contacting devices like mechanical heart valves and is called <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>carbon,</b> and is not diamagnetic.

The valve is coated with <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>carbon,</b> and secured to the surrounding tissue with a mesh of woven fabric called Dacron (du Pont's trade name for polyethylene terephthalate).

The {{development of these}} materials and diversity of manufacturing techniques has broadened the applications {{that can be used}} in the human body. They can be in the form of thin layers on metallic implants, composites with a polymer component, or even just porous networks. These materials work well within the human body for several reasons. They are inert, and because they are resorbable and active, the materials can remain in the body unchanged. They can also dissolve and actively take part in physiological processes, for example, when hydroxylapatite, a material chemically similar to bone structure, can integrate and help bone grow into it. Common materials used for bioceramics include alumina, zirconia, calcium phosphate, glass ceramics, and <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>carbons.</b>|$|R
25|$|Soon after came tilting-disc valves. The first {{clinically}} available tilting disk valve was the Bjork-Shiley valve and {{has undergone}} several significant design changes since its introduction in 1969. Tilting disk valves {{have a single}} circular occluder controlled by a metal strut. They are made of a metal ring covered by an ePTFE fabric, into which the suture threads are stitched in order to hold the valve in place. The metal ring holds, by means of two metal supports, a disc which opens and closes as the heart pumps blood through the valve. The disc is usually made of an extremely hard carbon material (<b>pyrolytic</b> <b>carbon),</b> {{in order to allow}} the valve to function for years without wearing out. The Medtronic-Hall model is the most common tilting-disc design in the US. In some models of mechanical valves, the disc is divided into two parts, which open and close as a door.|$|E
25|$|Tristructural-isotropic (TRISO) fuel {{is a type}} of micro fuel particle. It {{consists}} of a fuel kernel composed of UOX (sometimes UC or UCO) in the center, coated with four layers of three isotropic materials. The four layers are a porous buffer layer made of carbon, followed by a dense inner layer of <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>carbon</b> (PyC), followed by a ceramic layer of SiC to retain fission products at elevated temperatures and to give the TRISO particle more structural integrity, followed by a dense outer layer of PyC. TRISO fuel particles are designed not to crack due to the stresses from processes (such as differential thermal expansion or fission gas pressure) at temperatures up to and beyond 1600°C, and therefore can contain the fuel in the worst of accident scenarios in a properly designed reactor. Two such reactor designs are the pebble-bed reactor (PBR), in which thousands of TRISO fuel particles are dispersed into graphite pebbles, and the prismatic-block gas-cooled reactor (such as the GT-MHR), in which the TRISO fuel particles are fabricated into compacts and placed in a graphite block matrix. Both of these reactor designs are high temperature gas reactors (HTGRs). These are also the basic reactor designs of very-high-temperature reactors (VHTRs), one of the six classes of reactor designs in the Generation IV initiative that is attempting to reach even higher HTGR outlet temperatures.|$|E

40|$|Fiber/matrix {{interfacial}} {{strength is}} known {{to play an important}} role in the mechanical properties of SiCf/SiC composite. The understanding of the deformation mechanism of the fiber/matrix interphase under stress is important in application of SiCf/SiC composite. In the present work, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the shear strength and structural evolutions of fiber/matrix interphase of SiCf/SiC composite in atomic scale. It is revealed from our computational study that the interphase of graphite-like <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>carbons</b> are the weakest part in the interphase, which determines the interfacial mechanical properties. It is also found that an obvious drop of shear strength occurs at high temperature, owing to the Wigner energy release in the graphite-like carbons. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Pyrolysis of the cured materials {{took place at}} temperatures in the range 400 - 1000 degreesC. The most important weight loss, shrinkage and structural changes of pyrolyzed composites are observed at temperatures up to 600 degreesC due to the olive stone component. In the same temperature range, the changes in pyrolyzed novolac are smaller. The spectroscopic analysis shows that novolac pyrolyzed up to 900 degreesC has less defects and disorder than the composites. However, above 900 degreesC, pyrolyzed novolac becomes more disordered compared to the pyrolyzed composites. It is concluded that partial replacement of novolac by olive stone in the composite materials leads {{to the formation of}} a low cost, good quality product...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to better describe the structure of the hydrothermal carbon (HTC) process and put it in relationship with the more classical <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>carbons.</b> Indeed, despite the low energetic impact and the number of applications described so far for HTC, very little is known about the structure, reaction mechanism, and the way these materials relate to coals. Are HTC and calcination processes equivalent? Are the structures of the processed materials related to each other in any way? Which is the extent of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) inside HTC? In this work, the effect of hydrothermal treatment and pyrolysis are compared on glucose, a good model carbohydrate; a detailed single-quantum double-quantum (SQ-DQ) solid state 13 C NMR study of the HTC and calcined HTC is used to interpret the spectral region corresponding to the signal of furanic and arene groups. These data are compared to the spectroscopic signatures of calcined glucose, starch, and xylose. A semiquantitative analysis of the 13 C NMR spectra provides an estimation of the furanic-to-arene ratio which varies from 1 : 1 to 4 : 1 according to the processing conditions and carbohydrate employed. In addition, we formulate some hypothesis, validated by DFT (density functional theory) modeling associated with 13 C NMR chemical shifts calculations, about the possible furan-rich structural intermediates that occur in the coalification process leading to condensed polyaromatic structures. In combination with a broad parallel study on the HTC processing conditions effect on glucose, cellulose, and raw biomass (Falco, C.; Baccile, N.; Titirici, M. -M.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project {{is the development of}} an economically viable thermocatalytic process for production of hydrogen and carbon from natural gas or other hydrocarbon fuels with minimal environmental impact. The three major technical goals of this project are: (1) to accomplish efficient production of hydrogen and carbon via sustainable catalytic decomposition of methane or other hydrocarbons using inexpensive and durable carbon catalysts, (2) to obviate the concurrent production of CO/CO{sub 2 } byproducts and drastically reduce CO{sub 2 } emissions from the process, and (3) to produce valuable carbon products {{in order to reduce the}} cost of hydrogen production The important feature of the process is that the reaction is catalyzed by carbon particulates produced in the process, so no external catalyst is required (except for the start-up operation). This results in the following advantages: (1) no CO/CO{sub 2 } byproducts are generated during hydrocarbon decomposition stage, (2) no expensive catalysts are used in the process, (3) several valuable forms of carbon can be produced in the process depending on the process conditions (e. g., turbostratic <b>carbon,</b> <b>pyrolytic</b> graphite, spherical <b>carbon</b> particles, carbon filaments etc.), and (4) CO{sub 2 } emissions could be drastically reduced (compared to conventional processes) ...|$|R
