This paper tries to understand which mechanisms, if any, have been adopted {{in order to achieve}} a proper degree of international cooperation after the 2008 financial crisis. The analysis displays that the move towards a new economic global governance is not the result of a single strategy, but rather an original mix or blend of different solutions enhanced by flexibility and experimentalism. Some of them are an effort to strengthen multilateral agreements and the effectiveness of supranational institutions and regulatory measures; others aim to develop new forms of cooperation among governments, through a Â«concerted practiceÂ» way of action. Informal contacts and meetings among political leaders and the G- 20 summits became the preferred rooms to exchange points of view, to coordinate action without assuming legal obligations, to monitor voluntary compliance. The <b>parallel</b> <b>approval</b> of similar pieces of legislation at national level signaled the willingness of governments to effectively cooperate, though leaving space for opportunistic behaviors by some of them. governance; intergovernmentalism; international regimes; national interest; Nation-state; Nation-state; regulatory competition; comparative law; regulations; soft law; state aids; transparency; financial markets; globalization; New Economy; political economy; economic policy; accountability; national parliaments; European Central Bank; European Central Bank; European Commission; G 7; IMF; economics; law...|$|E

30|$|This was a randomized, {{double blind}} study with <b>parallel</b> groups. After <b>approval</b> of {{institutional}} research deputy and ethics committee, the patient suffering from knee OA were randomized to receive IA injections of 2  cc of {{high molecular weight}} (500, 000 – 730, 000) HA (Fidia Farmaceutici S.p.A, Italy) or IA injections of 40  mg CS. The treatment consisted of one IA injections of HA or one injection of CS. And the follow-up visits were scheduled at 1, 2, and 3  months. Before inclusion, for fulfillment of the entry criteria, patients were evaluated. Moreover, qualified patients were informed about the aim and design of the study.|$|R
40|$|A new era for the {{treatment}} of chronic hepatitis C is about to transpire. With the introduction of the first-generation protease inhibitors the efficacy of hepatitis C treatment improved significantly. Since then, the therapeutic agenda has moved further forward with the recent approval of sofosbuvir and the expected approval of agents such as simeprevir and daclatasvir. This paper, developed <b>parallel</b> to the <b>approval</b> of sofosbuvir, is to serve as a guidance for the therapeutic management of chronic hepatitis C. We performed a formal search through PubMed, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials. gov to identify all clinical trials that have been conducted with EMA-approved new agents in hepatitis C; for this version (April 2014) we focused on sofosbuvir. For each disease category, the evidence was reviewed and recommendations are based on GRADE. We identified 11 clinical trials with sofosbuvir and for each disease category recommendations for treatment are made. Not all disease categories were studied extensively and therefore in some cases we were unable to provide recommendations. The recent approval of sofosbuvir will most likely change the therapeutic landscape of chronic hepatitis C. The use of sofosbuvir-containing regimens can shorten the duration of therapy, increase efficacy and result in less side effects, compared with standard of care. The efficacy relative to standard of care needs to be weighed against the increased costs of sofosbuvir. With future approval of the other direct-acting antivirals, the outcome of hepatitis C treatment will likely improve further and this guidance will be update...|$|R
