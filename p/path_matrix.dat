40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} k-path Laplacian matrix of a graph is {{motivated}} and introduced. The <b>path</b> Laplacian <b>matrices</b> are a natural generalization of the combinatorial Laplacian of a graph. They are defined by using <b>path</b> <b>matrices</b> accounting {{for the existence of}} shortest paths of length k between two nodes. This new concept is motivated by the problem of determining whether every node of a graph can be visited by means of a process consisting of hopping from one node to another separated at distance k from it. The problem is solved by using the multiplicity of the trivial eigenvalue of the corresponding k-path Laplacian matrix. We apply these matrices to the analysis of the consensus among agents in a networked system. We show how the consensus in different types of network topologies is accelerated by considering not only nearest neighbors but also the influence of long-range interacting ones. Further applications of <b>path</b> Laplacian <b>matrices</b> in a variety of other fields, e. g., synchronization, flocking, Markov chains, etc., will open a new avenue in algebraic graph theory...|$|R
