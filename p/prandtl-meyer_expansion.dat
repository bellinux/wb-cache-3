40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical analysis of perfect gas flow over a convex {{corner of a}} rigid-body contour. It is assumed that the flow is subsonic before the corner. It accelerates {{around the corner to}} become supersonic, and then undergoes an additional acceleration in the <b>expansion</b> <b>Prandtl–Meyer</b> fan that forms in the supersonic part of the flow behind the corner. The entire process is described by a self-similar solution of the K´arm´an–Guderley equation. The latter shows that the boundary layer approaching the apex of the corner is exposed to a singular pressure gradient, dp/dx ∼ (−x) − 3 / 5, where x denotes the coordinate measured along the body surface from the corner apex. Under these conditions, the solution for the boundary layer also develops a singularity. In particular, the longitudinal velocity near the body surface behaves as U ∼ Y 1 / 2. Here Y is the normal coordinate scaled with the boundary-layer thickness Re − 1 / 2; Re being the Reynolds number, assumed large in this theory. As usual, the boundary layer splits up into two parts, a viscous near-wall sublayer and a locally inviscid main part of the boundary layer. The analysis of the displacement effect of the boundary layer shows that neither the viscous sublayer nor the main part determines the displacement thickness. Instead, the overlapping region situated between them proves to be responsible for the shape of the streamlines at {{the outer edge of the}} boundary layer. This leads to a significant simplification of the analysis of the flow behaviour in the viscous–inviscid interaction region that forms in a small vicinity of the corner. In order to describe the flow behaviour in this region, one has to solve the K´arm´an–Guderley equation for the inviscid part of the flow outside the boundary layer. The influence of the boundary layer is expressed through a boundary condition, that relates the streamline deflection angle ϑ at the outer edge of the boundary layer to the pressure gradient dp/dx acting upon the boundary layer. The boundary-layer analysis leads to an analytical formula that relates ϑ and dp/dx (unlike in previous studies of the viscous–inviscid interaction). The interaction problem was solved numerically to confirm that the solution develops a finite-distance singularity...|$|R

In contrast to the commonly used approaches, in the present work ghost cells are mirrored through the boundary described using a level-set method to farther image points, incorporating a higher-order extra/interpolation scheme for the ghost cell values. A sensor is introduced to deal with image points near the discontinuities in the flow field. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is used to improve {{the representation of the}} geometry efficiently in the Cartesian grid system. The improved ghost-cell method is validated against four test cases: (a) double Mach reflections on a ramp, (b) smooth <b>Prandtl-Meyer</b> <b>expansion</b> flows, (c) supersonic flows in a wind tunnel with a forward-facing step, and (d) supersonic flows over a circular cylinder.

40|$|Two-dimensional {{adaptive}} simulations {{are carried}} out solving the reactive Euler equations with a detailed reaction model based on the open-source program AMROC to investigate detonation evolution using a hot jet initiation in expanding channel filled with supersonic combustible mixtures. The {{results show that the}} supersonic mixture experiences a <b>Prandtl-Meyer</b> <b>expansion</b> with according flow acceleration in the expanding channel, which eventually leads to the nonuniformity of the incoming flow. The nonuniformity characteristic of the mixture results in the generation of a curved detonation directly behind the expansion region. Due to the low numerical diffusion for high grid-resolution, the unburned jet directly behind the expansion fan is consumed slowly, hence resulting in some chemical heat loss when it is released after the sonic plane behind the detonation front. This can further weaken the detonation front, which might be {{one of the reasons that}} result in the rapid attenuation of the detonation front. Because of highly oscillating near the upper wall resulting from the expansion fan, the shear layer along with the unburned jet becomes very unstable, hence leading to unsuccessful construction of hydrodynamic throat.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{interaction}} of a vortical density inhomogeneity (VDI) with shock and expansion waves. We call the VDI the region of concentrated vorticity (vortex) with a density {{different from that of}} ambiance. Non-parallel directions of the density gradient normal to the VDI surface and the pressure gradient across a shock wave results in an additional vorticity. The roll-up of the initial round VDI towards a non-symmetrical shape is studied numerically. Numerical modeling of this interaction is performed by a 2 -D Euler code. The use of an adaptive unstructured numerical grid makes it possible to obtain high accuracy and capture regions of induced vorticity with a moderate overall number of mesh points. For the validation of the code, the computational results are compared with available experimental results and good agreement is obtained. The interaction of the VDI with a propagating shock wave is studied for a range of initial and induced circulations and obtained flow patterns are presented.

40|$|The design {{characteristics}} of an inlet very much {{depend on whether}} the inlet is to be flown at subsonic, supersonic, or hypersonic speed. Whichever the case, the primary function of an inlet is to deliver free-stream air to the engine face at the highest stagnation pressure possible and with the lowest possible variation in both stagnation pressure and temperature. At high speeds, this is achieved by a system of oblique and/or normal shock waves, and possibly some isentropic compression. For both subsonic and supersonic flight, current design practice indicates that the inlet should deliver the air to the engine face at approximately Mach 0. 45. As a result, even for flight in the high subsonic regime, the inlet must retard (or diffuse) the air substantially. Second, the design of an inlet is influenced largely by the compromise between high performance and low weight. This compromise involves tradeoffs between the mission requirements, flight trajectory, airframe aerodynamics, engine performance, and weight-all of which, in turn, influence each other. Therefore, to {{study the effects of}} some of these influential factors, the Propulsion System Analysis Office of the NASA Lewis Research Center developed the Inlet Performance Analysis Code (IPAC). This code uses oblique shock and <b>Prandtl-Meyer</b> <b>expansion</b> theory to predict inlet performance. It can be used to predict performance for a given inlet geometric design such as pitot, axisymmetric, and two-dimensional. IPAC also can be used to design preliminary inlet systems and to make subsequent performance analyses. It computes the total pressure, the recovery, the airflow, and the drag coefficients.

SCRAMjet engine performance characteristics, such as fuel flow rate, can also be determined. The vehicle is assumed to be a lifting body with a single aerodynamic control surface. The body shape and control surface location are arbitrary and must be defined. The aerodynamics are calculated using either 2 -dimensional Newtonian or modified Newtonian theory and approximate high-Mach-number <b>Prandtl-Meyer</b> <b>expansion</b> theory. Skin-friction drag was also accounted for. The skin-friction drag coefficient {{is a function of the}} freestream Mach number. The data for the skin-friction drag coefficient values were taken from NASA Technical Memorandum 102610. The modeling of the vehicle's SCRAMjet engine is based on quasi 1 -dimensional gas dynamics for the engine diffuser, nozzle, and the combustor with heat addition. The engine has three variable inputs for control: the engine inlet diffuser area ratio, the total temperature rise through the combustor due to combustion of the fuel, and the engine internal expansion nozzle area ratio. The pressure distribution over the vehicle's lower aft body surface, which acts as an external nozzle, is calculated using a combination of quasi 1 -dimensional gas dynamic theory and Newtonian or modified Newtonian theory. The exhaust plume shape is determined by matching the pressure inside the plume, calculated from the gas dynamic equations, with the freestream pressure, calculated from Newtonian or Modified Newtonian theory. In this manner, the pressure distribution along the vehicle after body expansion surface is then determined.
