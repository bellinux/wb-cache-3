5|$|Food is {{ingested}} {{through the}} mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx {{and then into the}} esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. When food is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. <b>Peristaltic</b> contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also {{as a response to the}} sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.|$|E
25|$|A <b>peristaltic</b> pump {{was first}} {{patented}} in the United States by Eugene Allen in 1881 (U.S. Patent number 249285) for the transfusion of blood.|$|E
25|$|Nymphs {{emerge from}} the eggs through <b>peristaltic</b> {{movements}} {{and with the help}} of an internal nearly H-shaped structure in the egg known as the 'egg burster'.|$|E
25|$|Distended small intestine, {{based on}} rectal or {{abdominal}} ultrasound findings. On ultrasound, ileus presents {{as more than}} 3 loops of distended small intestine, {{with a lack of}} <b>peristaltic</b> waves.|$|E
25|$|In {{some species}} of Bryozoa, {{the first part}} of the stomach forms a muscular gizzard lined with chitinous teeth that crush {{armoured}} prey such as diatoms. Wave-like <b>peristaltic</b> contractions then move the food through the stomach for digestion.|$|E
25|$|Between the two muscle layers is the myenteric plexus. This {{controls}} peristalsis. Activity is {{initiated by}} the pacemaker cells, (myenteric interstitial cells of Cajal). The gut has intrinsic <b>peristaltic</b> activity (basal electrical rhythm) due to its self-contained enteric nervous system. The rate can be modulated {{by the rest of}} the autonomic nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Megacolon is an {{abnormal}} dilation {{of the colon}} (also called the large intestine). The dilation is often accompanied by a paralysis of the <b>peristaltic</b> movements of the bowel. In more extreme cases, the feces consolidate into hard masses inside the colon, called fecalomas (literally, fecal tumor), which can require surgery to be removed.|$|E
25|$|Achalasia {{is a major}} {{exception}} to usual pattern of dysphagia in that swallowing of fluid tends to cause more difficulty than swallowing solids. In achalasia, there is idiopathic destruction of parasympathetic ganglia of the Auerbach's (Myenteric) plexus of the entire esophagus, which results in functional narrowing of the lower esophagus, and <b>peristaltic</b> failure throughout its length.|$|E
25|$|The non-motile {{spermatozoa}} are {{transported to}} the epididymis in testicular fluid secreted by the Sertoli cells {{with the aid of}} <b>peristaltic</b> contraction. While in the epididymis the spermatozoa gain motility and become capable of fertilization. However, transport of the mature spermatozoa through the remainder of the male reproductive system is achieved via muscle contraction rather than the spermatozoon's recently acquired motility.|$|E
25|$|Fluid {{dynamics}} {{also plays}} an important role in vascular remodelling. The shear stress applied to vessel walls is proportional to the viscosity and flow patterns of the fluid. Disturbed flow patterns can promote the formation of valves and increasing pressure can affect the radial growth of vessels. The primitive heart within the first few days of contraction is best described as a <b>peristaltic</b> pump, however after three days the flow becomes pulsatile. Pulsatile flow {{plays an important}} role in vascular remodelling, as flow patterns can affect the mechanotransduction of stress to endothelial cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} laid in compact clusters. They may be round or {{barrel-shaped}} with a lid or a cap {{at the top}} (known as the operculum). They also contain a ring of small protuberances near the cap called micropylar processes. They permit the passage of sperm into the egg for fertilization and enable gaseous exchange from within the egg and the outside world for the embryos. The eggs are white or cream colored when freshly laid but can change color as the embryo matures. When hatching, the prolarva (the advanced embryo) exit the egg by opening the lid through <b>peristaltic</b> movements {{and with the help}} of a T-shaped internal structure in the egg (known as the egg burster).|$|E
25|$|Body fluids enter through one-way valved ostia, {{which are}} {{openings}} situated {{along the length}} of the combined aorta and heart organ. Pumping of the haemolymph occurs by waves of <b>peristaltic</b> contraction, originating at the body's posterior end, pumping forwards into the dorsal vessel, out via the aorta and then into the head where it flows out into the haemocoel. The haemolymph is circulated to the appendages unidirectionally with the aid of muscular pumps or accessory pulsatile organs usually found at the base of the antennae or wings and sometimes in the legs, with pumping rates accelerating with periods of increased activity. Movement of haemolymph is particularly important for thermoregulation in orders such as Odonata, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera.|$|E
25|$|Gas colic, {{also known}} as tympanic colic, {{is the result of}} gas buildup within the horse's {{digestive}} tract due to excessive fermentation within the intestines or a decreased ability to move gas through it. It is usually the result of a change in diet, but can also occur due to low dietary roughage levels, parasites (22% of spasmodic colics are associated with tapeworms), and anthelminthic administration. This gas buildup causes distention and increases pressure in the intestines, causing pain. Additionally, it usually causes an increase in <b>peristaltic</b> waves, which can lead to painful spasms of the intestine, producing subsequent spasmodic colic. The clinical signs of these forms of colic are generally mild, transient, and respond well to spasmolytic medications, such as buscopan, and analgesics. Gas colics usually self-correct, but there is the risk of subsequent torsion (volvulus) or displacement of the bowel due to gas distention, which causes this affected piece of bowel to rise upward in the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|Normal flatus {{volume range}} is around 476 to 1,491nbsp&ml per 24 hours. This {{variability}} between individuals is greatly dependent upon diet. Similarly {{the number of}} flatus episodes per day is variable, the normal range is given as 8–20 per day. The volume of flatus associated with each flatulence event again varies (5–375nbsp&ml). The volume of the first flatulence upon waking in the morning is significantly larger than those during the day. This {{may be due to}} buildup of intestinal gas in the colon during sleep, the peak in <b>peristaltic</b> activity in the first few hours after waking or the strong prokinetic effect of rectal distension on the rate of transit of intestinal gas. It is now known that gas is moved along the gut independently of solids and liquids, and this transit is more efficient in the erect position compared to when supine. It is thought that large volumes of intestinal gas present low resistance, and can be propelled by subtle changes in gut tone, capacitance and proximal contraction and distal relaxation. This process is thought not to affect solid and liquid intra-lumenal contents.|$|E
25|$|Lymph {{is formed}} from the fluid that filters {{out of the}} blood {{circulation}} to nourish cells. This fluid returns through venous capillaries to the blood circulation through the force of osmosis in the venous blood; however, {{a portion of the}} fluid that contains proteins, cellular debris, bacteria, etc. must return through the lymphatic collection system to maintain tissue fluid balance. The collection of this prelymph fluid is carried out by the initial lymph collectors that are blind-ended epithelial-lined vessels with fenestrated openings that allow fluids and particles as large as cells to enter. Once inside the lumen of the lymphatic vessels, the fluid is guided along increasingly larger vessels, first with rudimentary valves to prevent backflow, which later develop into complete valves similar to the venous valve. Once the lymph enters the fully valved lymphatic vessels, it is pumped by a rhythmic peristaltic-like action by smooth muscle cells within the lymphatic vessel walls. This <b>peristaltic</b> action is the primary driving force, moving lymph within its vessel walls. The regulation of the frequency and power of contraction is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system. Lymph movement can be influenced by the pressure of nearby muscle contraction, arterial pulse pressure and the vacuum created in the chest cavity during respiration, but these passive forces contribute only a minor percentage of lymph transport. The fluids collected are pumped into continually larger vessels and through lymph nodes, which remove debris and police the fluid for dangerous microbes. The lymph ends its journey in the thoracic duct or right lymphatic duct, which drain into the blood circulation.|$|E
500|$|Cirrate {{octopuses}} cannot produce {{jet propulsion}} {{and rely on}} their fins for swimming. They have neutral buoyancy and drift through the water with the fins extended. They can also contract their arms and surrounding web to make sudden moves known as [...] "take-offs". Another form of locomotion is [...] "pumping", which involves symmetrical contractions of muscles in their webs producing <b>peristaltic</b> waves. This moves the body slowly.|$|E
500|$|The {{esophagus}} (American English) or oesophagus (British English) (...) , {{commonly known}} as the food pipe or gullet, is an organ in vertebrates through which food passes, aided by <b>peristaltic</b> contractions, from the pharynx to the stomach. The esophagus is a [...] tube, about 25centimetres long in adults, which travels behind the trachea and heart, passes through the diaphragm and empties into the uppermost region of the stomach. During swallowing, the epiglottis tilts backwards to prevent food from going down the larynx and lungs. The word esophagus is the Greek word οἰσοφάγος oisophagos, meaning [...] "gullet".|$|E
500|$|The word {{esophagus}} (British English: oesophagus), {{comes from}} the [...] (oisophagos) meaning gullet. It derives from two roots [...] (eosin) to carry and (phagos) to eat. The {{use of the word}} oesophagus, has been documented in anatomical literature since at least the time of Hippocrates, who noted that [...] "the oesophagus... receives the greatest amount of what we consume." [...] Its existence in other animals and its relationship with the stomach was documented by the Roman naturalist [...] Pliny the Elder (AD23–AD79), and the <b>peristaltic</b> contractions of the esophagus have been documented since at least the time of Galen.|$|E
2500|$|An active <b>peristaltic</b> {{mechanism}} of the diverticulum that attempts to remove irritating factors ...|$|E
2500|$|Three other {{criteria}} for {{definition of the}} nutcracker esophagus have been defined. [...] The Gothenburg criterion consists {{of the presence of}} <b>peristaltic</b> contractions, with an amplitude of 180mm Hg at any place in the esophagus. [...] The Richter criterion involves the presence of <b>peristaltic</b> contractions with an amplitude of greater than 180 mmHg from an average of measurements taken 3 and 8cm above the lower esophageal sphincter. It has been incorporated into a number of clinical guidelines for the evaluation of dysphagia. [...] The Achem criteria are more stringent, and are an extension of the study of 93 patients used by Richter and Castell in the development of their criteria, and require amplitudes of greater than 199mm Hg at 3cm above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), greater than 172mm Hg at 8cm above the LES, or greater than 102mm Hg at 13cm above the LES.|$|E
2500|$|The pyloric antrum is {{the initial}} {{portion of the}} pylorus. It is {{near the bottom of}} the stomach, {{proximal}} to the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach and the duodenum. [...] It may temporarily become partially or completely shut off from the remainder of the stomach during digestion by <b>peristaltic</b> contraction of the prepyloric sphincter; it is demarcated, sometimes, from the pyloric canal by a slight groove.|$|E
2500|$|The opium addict, {{according}} to Ludlow (in a view which even today seems progressive), “is a proper subject, not for reproof, but for medical treatment. The problem {{of his case}} need embarrass nobody. It is as purely physical as one of smallpox.... is suffering under a disease of the very machinery of volition; and no more to be judged harshly for his acts than a wound for suppurating or the bowels for continuing the <b>peristaltic</b> motion.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Diagnosis is via {{a careful}} history and {{physical}} examination, often supplemented by radiographic imaging studies. Pyloric stenosis should be suspected in any young infant with severe vomiting. On physical exam, palpation of the abdomen may reveal a {{mass in the}} epigastrium. This mass, which consists of the enlarged pylorus, {{is referred to as}} the 'olive', and is sometimes evident after the infant is given formula to drink. Rarely, there are <b>peristaltic</b> waves that may be felt or seen (...) due to the stomach trying to force its contents past the narrowed pyloric outlet.|$|E
2500|$|Nutcracker {{esophagus}} {{is characterized}} by a number of criteria described in the literature. [...] The most commonly used criteria are the Castell criteria, named after American gastroenterologist D.O. Castell. [...] The Castell criteria include one major criterion: a mean <b>peristaltic</b> amplitude in the distal esophagus of more than 180mm Hg. [...] The minor criterion is the presence of repetitive contractions (meaning two or more) that are greater than six seconds in duration. [...] Castell also noted that the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes normally in nutcracker esophagus, but has an elevated pressure of greater than 40mm Hg at baseline.|$|E
2500|$|Body fluids enter {{through one}} way valved ostia which are {{openings}} situated {{along the length}} of the combined aorta and heart organ. Pumping of the hemolymph occurs by waves of <b>peristaltic</b> contraction, originating at the body's posterior end, pumping forwards into the dorsal vessel, out via the aorta and then into the head where it flows out into the haemocoel. The hemolymph is circulated to the appendages unidirectionally with the aid of muscular pumps or accessory pulsatile organs which are usually found at the base of the [...] antennae or wings and sometimes in the legs. Pumping rate accelerates due to periods of increased activity.

2500|$|Duodenography and colonography are {{performed}} like a standard abdominal examination using B-mode and color flow Doppler ultrasonography using a low frequency transducer — for example a 2.5MHz — {{and a high}} frequency transducer, for example a 7.5MHz probe. Detailed examination of duodenal walls and folds, colonic walls and haustra was performed using a 7.5MHz probe. Deeply located abdominal structures were examined using 2.5MHz probe. All ultrasound examinations {{are performed}} after overnight fasting (for at least 16 hours) using standard scanning procedure. Subjects are examined with and without water contrast. Water contrast imaging is performed by having adult subjects take at least one liter of water prior to examination. Patients are examined in the supine, left posterior oblique, and left lateral decubitus positions using the intercostal and subcostal approaches. The liver, gall bladder, spleen, pancreas, duodenum, colon, and kidneys are routinely evaluated in all patients. With patient lying supine, {{the examination of the}} duodenum with high frequency ultrasound duodenography is performed with 7.5MHz probe placed in the right upper abdomen, and central epigastric successively; for high frequency ultrasound colonography, the ascending colon, is examined with starting point usually midway of an imaginary line running from the iliac crest to the umbilicus and proceeding cephalid through the right mid abdomen; for the descending colon, the examination begins from the left upper abdomen proceeding caudally and traversing the left mid abdomen and left lower abdomen, terminating at the sigmoid colon in the lower pelvic region. [...] Color flow Doppler sonography is used to examine the localization of lesions in relation to vessels. [...] All measurements of diameter and wall thickness are performed with built-in software. Measurements are taken between <b>peristaltic</b> waves.|$|E
60|$|It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} <b>peristaltic</b> movements of the intestines are influenced by attention being paid to them at fixed recurrent periods; and these movements depend on the contraction of unstriped and involuntary muscles. The abnormal action of the voluntary muscles in epilepsy, chorea, and hysteria {{is known to be}} influenced by the expectation of an attack, and by the sight of other patients similarly affected.[37] So it is with the involuntary acts of yawning and laughing.|$|E
6000|$|As {{time passes}} three reddish-grey streams of marching men loom out [...] to the north, {{advancing}} southward along three roads towards three [...] diverse {{points in the}} first defence. These form the English army, [...] entering the lines for shelter. Looked down upon, their motion [...] seems <b>peristaltic</b> and vermicular, like that of three caterpillars. [...] The division on the left is under Picton, in the centre under Leith [...] and Cole, and on the extreme right, by Alhandra, under Hill. Beside [...] one of the roads two or three of the soldiers are dangling from a [...] tree by the neck, probably for plundering.|$|E
60|$|Another {{explanation}} seems possible. We may {{admit that}} originally the arrectores pili were slightly acted on {{in a direct}} manner, {{under the influence of}} rage and terror, by the disturbance of the nervous system; as is undoubtedly the case with our so-called goose-skin before a fever-fit. Animals have been repeatedly excited by rage and terror during many generations; and consequently the direct effects of the disturbed nervous system on the dermal appendages will almost certainly have been increased through habit and through the tendency of nerve-force to pass readily along accustomed channels. We shall find this view of the force of habit strikingly confirmed in a future chapter, where it will be shown that the hair of the insane is affected in an extraordinary manner, owing to their repeated accesses of fury and terror. As soon as with animals the power of erection had thus been strengthened or increased, they must often have seen the hairs or feathers erected in rival and enraged males, and the bulk of their bodies thus increased. In this case it appears possible that they might have wished to make themselves appear larger and more terrible to their enemies, by voluntarily assuming a threatening attitude and uttering harsh cries; such attitudes and utterances after a time becoming through habit instinctive. In this manner actions performed by the contraction of voluntary muscles might have been combined for the same special purpose with those effected by involuntary muscles. It is even possible that animals, when excited and dimly conscious of some change in the state of their hair, might act on it by repeated exertions of their attention and will; for we have {{reason to believe that the}} will is able to influence in an obscure manner the action of some unstriped or involuntary muscles, as in the period of the <b>peristaltic</b> movements of the intestines, and in the contraction of the bladder. Nor must we overlook the part which variation and natural selection may have played; for the males which succeeded in making themselves appear the most terrible to their rivals, or to their other enemies, if not of overwhelming power, will on an average have left more offspring to inherit their characteristic qualities, whatever these may be and however first acquired, than have other males.|$|E
50|$|Such {{an ideal}} <b>peristaltic</b> pump {{can not be}} {{constructed}} in reality. However, <b>peristaltic</b> pumps can be designed to approach these ideal <b>peristaltic</b> pump parameters. One example of a possible construction is depicted. The exceptional design of the few <b>peristaltic</b> pumps offer constant accurate flow rates for several weeks together with a long tubing lifetime without the risk of tubing rupture.|$|E
50|$|Another {{version of}} CCD {{is called a}} <b>peristaltic</b> CCD. In a <b>peristaltic</b> {{charge-coupled}} device, the charge-packet transfer operation {{is analogous to the}} <b>peristaltic</b> contraction and dilation of the digestive system. The <b>peristaltic</b> CCD has an additional implant that keeps the charge away from the silicon/silicon dioxide interface and generates a large lateral electric field from one gate to the next. This provides an additional driving force to aid in transfer of the charge packets.|$|E
50|$|Microplate {{dispensers}} deliver pre-determined fluid volumes to microplate wells {{using either}} <b>peristaltic</b> pumps or microprocessor-controlled syringe drives. <b>Peristaltic</b> pumps {{are used for}} continuous or semi-continuous liquid dispensing; syringe dispensers are used for precise dispensing in sub-microliter volumes.|$|E
50|$|The ideal <b>peristaltic</b> pump {{should have}} an {{infinite}} diameter of the pump head and the largest possible diameter of the rollers. Such an ideal <b>peristaltic</b> pump would offer the longest possible tubing lifetime and provide a constant and pulsation-free flow rate.|$|E
50|$|Once an {{automatic}} refractometer {{is equipped with}} a flow cell, the sample can either be filled by means of a syringe or by using a <b>peristaltic</b> pump. Modern refractometers have the option of a built-in <b>peristaltic</b> pump. This is controlled via the instrument‘s software menu. A <b>peristaltic</b> pump opens the way to monitor batch processes in the laboratory or perform multiple measurements on one sample without any user interaction. This eliminates human error and assures a high sample throughput.|$|E
50|$|<b>Peristaltic</b> pumps use {{motor-driven}} rollers to roll along flexible tubing, compressing it to {{push forward}} a liquid inside. Although <b>peristaltic</b> pumps {{can be used}} to meter at lower pressures, the flexible tubing is limited in the level of pressure it can withstand.|$|E
50|$|<b>Peristaltic</b> {{pumps are}} not {{generally}} used for high pressures.|$|E
