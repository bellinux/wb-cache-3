5000|$|A grape tomato is a {{class of}} {{tomatoes}} believed to be of southeast Asian origin, shaped similarly to the oval <b>plum</b> <b>tomatoes</b> but having the small size and sweetness of cherry tomatoes. Grape tomatoes produce small and typically oblong fruits. Introduced to the worldwide market in the 1990s, they have gained substantial popularity, due {{at least in part}} to their higher sugar content compared to regular tomatoes, and due to their smaller, bite-sized shape. (See the Washington Post article.) ...|$|E
50|$|A plum tomato, {{also known}} as a {{processing}} tomato or paste tomato, is a type of tomato bred for sauce and packing purposes. They are generally oval or cylindrical in shape, with significantly fewer locules (seed compartments) than standard round tomatoes (usually only two) and a generally higher solid content, making them more suitable for processing. <b>Plum</b> <b>tomatoes</b> are also sometimes favored by cooks for use during the tomato off-season, as they are generally considered more amenable to handling and are therefore available in a state closer to ripe than other supermarket tomatoes.|$|E

50|$|Bovino's {{economy is}} principally agrarian. Main crops are olive oil, {{sunflower}} oil, wine and tomatoes. Family small holdings have increasingly {{given way to}} co-operatives, allowing farmers {{to gain access to}} larger markets. Grape vines are generally of the sangiovese variety. Bovino grows winter tomatoes in large greenhouses. Tomatoes are of the <b>plum</b> <b>tomato</b> variety. Bovino also has its own varieties of Puglia cheeses, including mozzarella, caciocavallo, ricotta and provolone. The main industrial area of Bovino is Bovino Scalo, situated 8 km downhill by the River Cervaro. This zone marks a boundary for the Tavoliere d'Italia, a large fertile plain famous for producing high quality durum wheat for pasta. Nearby Foggia claims several of the world's most famous pasta manufacturers, including Barilla and Buitoni.|$|R

30|$|Along with {{residential}} {{heating and}} pool attendance, geothermal water {{is used in}} a variety of different ways and has far reaching socioeconomic as well as cultural implications, such as reducing ecological footprints by supplying foodstuff: vegetables, fruit in greenhouses, fish farming, enabling production of certain health care products and even turning it into fuel fit for cars. The crucial point here for innovation is not to be stuck in the distinction between non-renewables and renewables as alternatives, but to focus on how different natural processes are appropriate for different purposes. As an innovation scholar, von Hippel (2006) stresses: “Users that innovate can develop exactly what they want, rather than relying on manufacturers to act as their (often very imperfect) agents”. The possibilities to serve articulated needs increase as the direct use of geothermal energy becomes more controllable.

5000|$|Diced {{tomatoes}} usually {{refers to}} tomatoes {{that have been}} diced. In the United States retail environment, however, the term refers to canned chunks of <b>plum</b> <b>tomatoes</b> in tomato juice or tomato purée, sometimes seasoned with basil or garlic. This product is a relatively recent arrival in the processed tomato market, and has become quite popular since its introduction in the mid-90s, probably due to American tastes for a chunkier tomato sauce. Calcium chloride is sometimes added to stabilize the cell structure of the canned tomatoes, giving the end product a firmer texture.|$|E
5000|$|A {{cherry tomato}} is a rounded, small fruited tomato {{thought to be}} an {{intermediate}} genetic admixture between wild currant-type tomatoes and domesticated garden tomatoes. [...] Cherry tomatoes {{range in size from}} a thumbtip up {{to the size of a}} golf ball, and can range from being spherical to slightly oblong in shape. Although usually red, other varieties such as yellow, green, and black also exist. [...] The more oblong ones often share characteristics with <b>plum</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> and are known as grape tomatoes. The berry tomato is regarded as a botanical variety of the cultivated berry, Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme.|$|E
50|$|In Puerto Rican cuisine, sofrito {{is mostly}} used when cooking rice dishes, sauces, and soups. Sofrito {{is closely related}} to recaíto. The two main {{ingredients}} that give Puerto Rican sofrito its characteristic flavor are recao (culantro) and ají dulce, but red and green cubanelle peppers, red bell peppers, pimientos, yellow onions, garlic, <b>plum</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> and cilantro are also added. All red peppers are roasted, seeded, and then added to the sofrito. Sofrito is traditionally cooked with olive oil or annatto oil, tocino (bacon), salted pork and cured ham. A mix of stuffed olives and capers called alcaparrado is usually added with spices such as bay leaf, sazón and adobo.|$|E

40|$|Food allergy is an {{increasing}} health problem, whereby plant allergens {{are one of the}} major source eliciting allergenic reactions. Ninety percent of birch pollen allergic patients develop intolerances to fruits and vegetables. Antibodies against Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen, cross-react with Bet v 1 -homolog proteins present in a variety of fruits and vegetables. Bet v 1 and Bet v 1 -homolog proteins belong to the family 10 of pathogenesis-related proteins (PR- 10). In plants PR- 10 proteins are induced in various stress conditions, e. g. pathogen attack, wounding or environmental factors. The amount of allergens is influenced by pre- and post-harvesting factors, such as cultivar, organic or conventional cultivation and storage conditions as well as different processing methods. The aim of the project is to develop an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to determine the allergen content in fruits (apple, strawberry, <b>plum,</b> <b>tomato)</b> and processed food products (apple juice, strawberry jam). The influence of organic versus conventional farming on the allergen content will be investigated. Furthermore, the effects of different processing techniques will be analyzed...|$|R

5000|$|Since {{the book}} was published, Janna has been touring and lecturing {{extensively}} about Israeli and Jewish Food, mainly in North America, and is involved in various media projects promoting Israeli gastronomy. She wrote (along with Joan Nathan) the first ever course on Israeli Cuisine for The New York Times Knowledge Network. [...] The idea for this course was initiated by the Israeli Consulate in New York, {{and was the first}} culinary course presented for The New York Times Knowledge Network. [...] At the time of the course's release, Israel had launched a widely publicized campaign to boost its declining public image, and it is likely this promotion of New Israeli Cuisine was a part of that campaign. [...] Gur's recipes have also been promoted by various Israeli agencies in the United States. For example, the Israeli Consulate in Los Angeles has released more than one of her recipes on their website. [...] This example is more recent, as both recipes were published online by the Israeli Consulate in Los Angeles in 2012, and it may be argued that this is still a part of Israel's ongoing campaign to rebrand itself. Her recipes have also garnered much attention in mainstream media outlets. For example, in 2009 New York (magazine) published Gur's shakshouka recipe as a use for in season <b>plum</b> <b>tomatoes.</b> [...] With all of this attention, Gur has undoubtedly become of the names most commonly attached to New Israeli Cuisine, particularly in the United States.She is currently involved in the Treasure Box project aimed at preserving Jewish ethnic cuisines for future generations.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{interaction}} {{of either the}} initial seed moisture content or seed vigour and imbibition temperature on germination, electrolyte leakage and seedling growth in <b>plum</b> <b>tomatoes</b> was studied. Specific moisture content critical points for the onset of imbibitional injury at either 25 degrees C (0. 18 and 0. 27 g/g for Cuore di bue and Allflesh 1120, respectively) or 5 degrees C (0. 31 g/g for both hybrids) were determined. In addition, imbibition temperature affected the rate of germination decline across the different moisture contents. The hybrid with the lower seed vigour had higher critical moist-Lire content after which there was a linear decline in germination. Leakage rates were not similar to imbibition rates (peak of leakage at 0. 24 to 0. 26 g/g compared to peak of imbibition at 0. 1 to 0. 15 g/g). It is suggested a specific structure of the seed coat called semipermeable layer would {{play a significant role}} in regulating the electrolyte leakage. Chilling imbibition (5 degrees C) had a significant effect on numbers of atypical seedlings. Seed surface micrographs (SEM) revealed the existence of a dense network of surface seed hairs that facilitated imbibition by increasing the contact area of seed to water. Cross sections of hybrid I (Allflesh I 180) seeds, revealed the presence of gaps between the embryo and the endosperm. Those gaps were the free water accumulation area and therefore those seeds would be more exposed to imbibition damage compared to seeds of hybrid 11 (Cuore di bue) that lacked the gaps. Data from this study, would give some explanations for the low germination and poor crop stand establishment frequently observed under field conditions in <b>plum</b> <b>tomatoes...</b>|$|E
