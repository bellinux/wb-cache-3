50|$|In late 1940. Commander Ito led a technical-exchange {{mission to}} Germany. Fluent in the German {{language}} {{and holding a}} doctorate from Dresden Technische Hochschule, he was well received. Staying several months, {{he became aware of}} their <b>pulse-modulated</b> radio equipment for detecting and ranging, and immediately sent word back to Japan that this technology should be incorporated in the NTRI-JRC effort. On August 2, 1941, even before Ito returned to Japan, funds were allocated for the initial development of a <b>pulse-modulated</b> Radio Range Finder (RRF - the Japanese code name for a radar).|$|E
50|$|Development of a Funkmessgerät für Untersuchung (radio {{measuring}} device for reconnaissance) soon {{began in earnest}} at GEMA. Hans Hollmann and Theodor Schultes, both affiliated with the prestigious Heinrich Hertz Institute in Berlin, were added as consultants. The first development was a continuous-wave apparatus using Doppler-beat interference for detection. Kühnhold then shifted the GEMA work to a <b>pulse-modulated</b> system.|$|E

In this research, the author has designed an electronic switch, using a power tetrode, to <b>pulse-modulate</b> a General Electric, Model 4 HD 3 B 2, Electronic Dielectric Heater. Pulse modulation was obtained by pulsing the control grid to drive the tetrode into and out of conduction. Pulse repetition frequencies from 2. 5 pulses per second to 3000 pulses per second and pulse widths from 400 milliseconds to 200 microseconds were obtained over a wide range in duty (0 ≤D≤ 1).

50|$|In late 1937, Maurice Elie at SFR {{developed}} {{a means of}} <b>pulse-modulating</b> transmitter tubes. This led to a new 16-cm system with a peak power near 500 W and a pulse width of 6 μs. French and U.S. patents were filed in December 1939. The system was planned to be sea-tested aboard the Normandie, but this was cancelled at the outbreak of war.|$|R
40|$|By <b>pulse-modulating</b> a cw dye-laser {{beam and}} {{employing}} the delayed-coincidence technique, we have determined the natural radiative lifetimes {{of a number}} of atomic states in rare-earth atoms Eu, Dy, and Yb. In the measurements, which were performed on an atomic beam, exponential decay curves with good statistics were obtained using short measuring times. The general features of the technique are discussed. When possible, oscillator strengths are deduced and compared with literature values...|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1930s, {{the firm}} Gesellschaft für Electroakustische und Mechanische Apparate (GEMA) started the {{development}} of a Funkmessgerät (radio indicator), as the British and the Americans did at the same time. The <b>pulse-modulated</b> system was based on earlier work of Dr. Rudolf Kühnhold, a scientist with the Kriegsmarine (German navy), and was done in the greatest secrecy, not even informing the other armed forces of its existence.|$|E
50|$|After {{receiving}} the {{reports from the}} technical exchange in Germany, as well as intelligence reports concerning the success of Britain with firing using RDF, the Naval General Staff reversed itself and tentatively accepted pulse-transmission technology. On August 2, 1941, even before Yoji Ito returned to Japan, funds were allocated for the initial development of <b>pulse-modulated</b> radars. Commander Chuji Hashimoto of the NTRI was responsible for initiating this activity.|$|E
50|$|In {{parallel}} with the VHF work, Yoji Ito also returned to the magnetron applications, resulting in Japan’s first <b>pulse-modulated</b> microwave RRF set. It operated at 10 cm (3 GHz) and produced a peak-power of 2.0 kW. A prototype was tested in October 1941, and several versions for surface ships and submarines were soon put into production. Naval officials favored the microwave sets because with very narrow beams they were less vulnerable to interception.|$|E
50|$|The {{equipment}} was placed atop a tower at a NVA test facility beside the Lubecker Bay near Pelzerhaken. This <b>pulse-modulated</b> system first detected returns from woods {{across the bay}} at a range of 15 km in May 1935, but had limited success detecting a ship only a short distance out on the bay. The receiver was rebuilt, becoming a superheterodyne set, and the system then tracked vessels at up to 8-km range.|$|E
50|$|In 1936, the Défense Aérienne du Territoire (Defence of Air Territory), ran {{tests on}} David’s {{electromagnetic}} curtain. In the tests, the system detected {{most of the}} entering aircraft, but too many were missed. As the war grew closer, {{the need for an}} aircraft detection was critical. David realized the advantages of a pulsed system, and in October 1938 he designed a 50 MHz, <b>pulse-modulated</b> system with a peak-pulse power of 12 kW. This was built by the firm SADIR.|$|E
50|$|Unwanted {{by-product}} beat {{signals from}} the mixing stage do not need any further processing, as they are completely rejected by use of a low-pass filter at the audio output stage. The receiver design has the additional advantage of high selectivity, and is therefore a precision demodulator. The design principles can be extended to permit separation of adjacent channel broadcast signals whose sidebands may overlap the wanted transmission. The design also improves the detection of <b>pulse-modulated</b> transmission mode signals.|$|E
50|$|A 60-MHz (5.0-m) <b>pulse-modulated</b> {{transmitter}} {{was soon}} built; this generated 10-microsecond pulses with a wait-time of 90 microseconds between pulses. Using a large antenna atop the main NRL building and a separately located receiver modified {{to pass the}} pulse signals, Page began assembling the equipment. In December 1934, Page first successfully tested the apparatus, tracking an aircraft at up to one mile as it flew {{up and down the}} Potomac River. Although the detection range was small and the indications on the oscilloscope monitor were almost indistinct, it represented a proof of the basic concept.|$|E
50|$|Kühnhold then {{shifted the}} GEMA work to a <b>pulse-modulated</b> system. A new 50 cm (600 MHz) Philips {{magnetron}} with better frequency stability was used. It was modulated with 2- μs pulses at a PRF of 2000 Hz. The transmitting antenna was {{an array of}} 10 pairs of dipoles with a reflecting mesh. The wide-band regenerative receiver used Acorn tubes from RCA, and the receiving antenna had three pairs of dipoles and incorporated lobe switching. A blocking device (a duplexer), shut the receiver input when the transmitter pulsed. A Braun tube (a CRT) was used for displaying the range.|$|E
50|$|Japan Radio Company (JRC) {{had long}} {{worked with the}} NTRI in {{developing}} magnetrons. In early 1941, JRC was given a contract by NTRI to design and build a microwave surface-detection system for warships. Designated Type 22, this used a <b>pulse-modulated,</b> 10-cm (3.0-GHz) magnetron with water-cooling and producing 2-kW peak-power. The receiver was a super-heterodyne type with a low-power magnetron serving as the local oscillator. Separate horn antennas were used for transmitting and receiving. These were mounted on a common platform that could be rotated in the horizontal plane. Since it was Japan's first full set using a magnetron, Yoji Ito was made responsible and gave it special attention.|$|E
50|$|Research in Funkmessgerät {{was started}} by Gottfried Müller at Lorenz, and by mid-1936 a <b>pulse-modulated</b> set was demonstrated. After an {{unsuccessful}} attempt to interest the German Navy, Müller's team turned to developing a system for supporting Flugzeugabwehrkanone (Flak, anti-aircraft guns). This set included a cathode ray tube that allowed the range to be shown in a circular display. In 1938, the Ordnance Office of the German Army gave Lorenz a contract to develop a prototype Flak-aiming set code-named Kurfürst. Although not put into immediate production, when antiaircraft guns were needed to protect against bombing by the Allies, two versions were produced by Lorenz: Tiefentwiel, a mobile system for use against low-flying aircraft, and Jadgwagen, a mobile unit used for air surveillance.|$|E
50|$|Engineers at Toshiba {{had already}} begun work on a <b>pulse-modulated</b> system. With {{the arrival of the}} damaged SCR-270, {{portions}} were incorporated into the ongoing development of a fixed-site, early-warning system designated Tachi-6. The transmitter operated in the 3- to 4-m (100- to 75-MHz) band with a peak power of 50 kW. It used a dipole-array antenna atop a tall pole. Multiple receiver stations were spaced about 100 m around the transmitter. Each of these had a hand-rotated pole with Yagi antennas at two levels, allowing azimuth and elevation measurements. One receiver station could track an aircraft while the others were searching. Ranges up to 300 km were attained and shown on a CRT display. This went into service in early 1943; about 350 Tachi-6 systems were eventually built.|$|E
50|$|Under an {{internally}} funded project, {{the firm}} Lorenz AG developed a <b>pulse-modulated</b> set. The Heer contracted {{for a few}} sets for Flak (anti-aircraft) support, but then this mission {{was transferred to the}} Luftwaffe. Over several years, Lorenz was unsuccessful in selling new versions called Kurfürst and Kurmark (both Holy Roman Imperial terms). As the war continued, a need was seen by the Luftwaffe for additional radars. Lorenz again modified their sets to become the Tiefentwiel, a transportable system built to complement the Freya against low-flying aircraft, and the Jagdwagen, a mobile unit used for air surveillance. These 54-cm (560-MHz) units with plan-position indicators, had two antennas backed by parabolic, mesh reflectors on rotatable, forked frames that lifted above the equipment cabin. Starting in 1944, both of these systems were produced by Lorenz for the Luftwaffe in relatively small numbers.|$|E
50|$|The {{objective}} of the Wellington group was to develop land-based and airborne RDF sets for detecting incoming vessels and a set to assist in gun-directing at coastal batteries. Within a few months, they had converted a 180-MHz (1.6-m), 1-kW transmitter from the Post Office to be <b>pulse-modulated</b> and used it in a system called CW (Coastal Watching). The CW {{was followed by a}} similar, improved system called CD (Coast Defense); it used a CRT for display and had lobe switching on the receiving antenna. This was placed into service at the Devonport Naval Base at Auckland. In this same period, a partially completed ASV 200-MHz set from Great Britain was made into an airborne set for the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF). About 20 sets were built and put into service. All three of these radars were placed into service before the end of 1940.|$|E
50|$|The Naval Technical Research Institute (NTRI) {{began work}} on a <b>pulse-modulated</b> system in August 1941, even before Yoji Ito {{returned}} from Germany. With assistance from NEC (Nippon Electric Company) and the Research Laboratory of NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), a prototype set was developed on a crash basis. Kenjiro Takayanagi, Chief Engineer of NHK, developed the pulse-forming and timing circuits {{as well as the}} receiver display. The prototype was tested in early September. The system, Japan's first full radar, was designated Mark 1 Model 1. (This type of designation is shortened herein to the numbers only; e.g., Type 11.) The system operated at 3.0 m (100 MHz) with a peak-power of 40 kW. Dipole arrays with mat-type reflectors were used in separate antennas for transmitting and receiving. In November 1941, the first manufactured Type 11 was placed into service as a land-based early-warning radar on the Pacific coast. A large system, it weighed close to 8,700 kg. Some 30 sets were built and used throughout the war. The detection range was about 130 km for single aircraft and 250 km for groups.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{before the}} First World War, Standard Elektrik Lorenz {{had been the}} main {{supplier}} of communication equipment for the German military and was the main rival of Telefunken. In late 1935, when Lorenz found that Runge at Telefunken was doing research in radio-based detection equipment, they started a similar activity under Gottfried Müller. A <b>pulse-modulated</b> set called Einheit für Abfragung (DFA - Device for Detection) was built. It used a type DS-310 tube (similar to the Acorn) operating at 70 cm (430 MHz) and about 1 kW power, it had identical transmitting and receiving antennas made with rows of half-wavelength dipoles backed by a reflecting screen. In early 1936, initial experiments gave reflections from large buildings at up to about 7 km. The power was doubled by using two tubes, and in mid-1936, the equipment was set up on cliffs near Kiel, and good detections of ships at 7 km and aircraft at 4 km were attained. [...] The success of this experimental set was reported to the Kriegsmarine, but they showed no interest; they were already fully engaged with GEMA for similar equipment. Also, because of extensive agreements between Lorenz and many foreign countries, the naval authorities had reservations concerning the company handling classified work. The DFA was then demonstrated to the Heer (German Army), and they contracted with Lorenz for developing Kurfürst (Elector), a system for supporting Flugzeugabwehrkanone (Flak, anti-aircraft guns).|$|E

40|$|Studies have {{repeatedly}} shown that electroencephalographic power during sleep is enhanced in the spindle frequency range following radio frequency electromagnetic field exposures <b>pulse-modulated</b> with fundamental frequency components of 2, 8, 14 or 217  Hz and combinations of these. However, signals used {{in previous studies}} also had significant harmonic components above 20  Hz. The current study aimed: (i) to determine if modulation components above 20  Hz, in combination with radio frequency, are necessary to alter the electroencephalogram; and (ii) to test the demodulation hypothesis, if the same effects occur after magnetic field exposure with the same pulse sequence used in the <b>pulse-modulated</b> radio frequency exposure. In a randomized double-blind crossover design, 25 young healthy men were exposed at weekly intervals to three different conditions for 30  min before sleep. Cognitive tasks were also performed during exposure. The conditions were a 2 -Hz <b>pulse-modulated</b> radio frequency field, a 2 -Hz pulsed magnetic field, and sham. Radio frequency exposure increased electroencephalogram power in the spindle frequency range. Furthermore, delta and theta activity (non-rapid eye movement sleep), and alpha and delta activity (rapid eye movement sleep) were affected following both exposure conditions. No effect on sleep architecture and no clear impact of exposure on cognition was observed. These results demonstrate that both <b>pulse-modulated</b> radio frequency and pulsed magnetic fields affect brain physiology, {{and the presence of}} significant frequency components above 20  Hz are not fundamental for these effects to occur.

40|$|Using a low power, rapid (nsec) <b>pulse-modulated</b> quantum cascade (QC) laser, {{collective}} coherent {{effects in}} the 5 mu m spectrum of nitric oxide have been demonstrated by the observation of sub-Doppler hyperfine splitting and also Autler-Townes splitting of Doppler broadened lines. For nitrous oxide, experiments and model calculations have demonstrated that two main effects occur with <b>pulse-modulated</b> (chirped) quantum cascade lasers: free induction decay signals, and signals induced by rapid passage during the laser chirp. In the open shell molecule, NO, in which both Lambda-doubling splitting and hyperfine structure occur, laser field-induced coupling between the hyperfine levels of the two Lambda-doublet components can induce a large ac Stark effect.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{observed}} increases in electroencephalographic power during {{sleep in the}} spindle frequency range (approximately 11 - 15  Hz) after exposure to mobile phone-like radio frequency electromagnetic fields (RF EMF). Results also suggest that pulse modulation of the signal is crucial to induce these effects. Nevertheless, it remains unclear which specific elements of the field {{are responsible for the}} observed changes. We investigated whether pulse-modulation frequency components in the range of sleep spindles may be involved in mediating these effects. Thirty young healthy men were exposed, at weekly intervals, to three different conditions for 30  min directly prior to an 8 -h sleep period. Exposure consisted of a 900 -MHz RF EMF, pulse modulated at 14  Hz or 217  Hz, and a sham control condition. Both active conditions had a peak spatial specific absorption rate of 2  W kg(- 1). During exposure subjects performed three different cognitive tasks (measuring attention, reaction speed and working memory), which were presented in a fixed order. Electroencephalographic power in the spindle frequency range was increased during non-rapid eye movement sleep (2 nd episode) following the 14 -Hz <b>pulse-modulated</b> condition. A similar but non-significant increase was also observed following the 217 -Hz <b>pulse-modulated</b> condition. Importantly, this exposure-induced effect showed considerable individual variability. Regarding cognitive performance, no clear exposure-related effects were seen. Consistent with previous findings, our results provide further evidence that <b>pulse-modulated</b> RF EMF alter brain physiology, although the time-course of the effect remains variable across studies. Additionally, we demonstrated that modulation frequency components within a physiological range may be sufficient to induce these effects...|$|E
40|$|Usage {{of mobile}} phones is rapidly increasing, {{but there is}} limited data on the {{possible}} effects of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure on brain physiology. We investigated the effect of EMF vs. sham control exposure on waking regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and on waking and sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) in humans. In Experiment 1, positron emission tomography (PET) scans were taken after unilateral head exposure to 30 -min <b>pulse-modulated</b> 900 MHz electromagnetic field (pm-EMF). In Experiment 2, night-time sleep was polysomnographically recorded after EMF exposure. <b>Pulse-modulated</b> EMF exposure increased relative rCBF in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ipsilateral to exposure. Also, pm-EMF exposure enhanced EEG power in the alpha frequency range prior to sleep onset and in the spindle frequency range during stage 2 sleep. Exposure to EMF without pulse modulation did not enhance power in the waking or sleep EEG. We previously observed EMF effects on the sleep EEG (A. A. Borbély, R. Huber, T. Graf, B. Fuchs, E. Gallmann and P. Achermann. Neurosci. Lett., 1999, 275 : 207 - 210; R. Huber, T. Graf, K. A. Cote, L. Wittmann, E. Gallmann, D. Matter, J. Schuderer, N. Kuster, A. A. Borbély, and P. Achermann. Neuroreport, 2000, 11 : 3321 - 3325), but the basis for these effects was unknown. The present results show {{for the first time}} that (1) pm-EMF alters waking rCBF and (2) pulse modulation of EMF is necessary to induce waking and sleep EEG changes. <b>Pulse-modulated</b> EMF exposure may provide a new, non-invasive method for modifying brain function for experimental, diagnostic and therapeutic purposes...|$|E
40|$|Solving a {{time-dependent}} two-dimensional local {{thermodynamic equilibrium}} (LTE) model simulation of Ar and Ar-H 2 atmospheric pressure, a high-power RF-induction thermal plasma was performed. The effects of shimmer current level (SCL) in <b>pulse-modulated</b> mode and hydrogen concentrations on different flow fields were predicted. The radiation intensities of Ar I (751 nm) for different SCL were calculated from the temperature fields. For the same operating conditions as simulation, plasma was successfully generated in <b>pulse-modulated</b> mode and spectroscopic measurements were carried out to investigate the effects of SCL upon temporal plasma properties. Response times (rising, falling, on-delay, and off-delay time) of temporal radiation intensity were crosschecked for both experimental and simulated ones. The rising time increased gradually with the decrease of SCL, though the falling time remained almost unchanged with SCL. For example, for Ar plasma at 86 percent, 79 percent, 72 percent, 65 percent, 50 percent, and 40 percent SCL the rising times were 2. 7, 3. 0, 3. 4, 3. 4, 3. 6, and 3. 8 ms, respectively. And for Ar-H 2 plasma (2. 4 percent H 2), at 87 percent, 77 percent, 72 percent, 63 percent, 55 percent, and 45 percent SCL, rising times were 2. 5, 3. 0, 3. 0, 3. 4, 3. 7, 3. 9, and 4. 0 ms, respectively. Hydrogen inclusion slowed down the plasma response during the off-to-on pulsing transition at lower SCL and constricted the plasma axially. Finally, part of the simulated results was compared with experimental determinations and acceptable agreements were found.
