In the scuffle that ensued a local Salem man, Joseph Whicher, was slightly injured by a British bayonet. Negotiations prevented any further bloodshed and the 64th withdrew to Boston, their mission a failure.|$|E
5|$|Cabin in the Cotton (1932) is a Warner Bros. message {{film about}} the evils of capitalism. The film takes <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{unspecified}} southern state where workers are given barely enough to survive and taken advantage of by being charged exorbitant interest rates and high prices by unscrupulous landowners. The film is decidedly anti-capitalist; however, its preface claims otherwise: In the end, however, the planters admit their wrongdoing and agree to a more equitable distribution of capital.|$|E
5|$|Drakengard 2 takes <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> unnamed land {{nearly two}} decades after the events of Drakengard: {{originally}} said to take place after the game's first ending, it was later retconned so it took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> isolated timeline following events similar to Drakengard. In the original game, two powers, the Empire and the Union, {{were engaged in a}} religious war over the Seals, magical bindings tied to a chosen Goddess of the Seal that kept dark entities known as the Watchers from appearing in the mortal world and destroying humanity. Caught up in the conflict were Caim and Angelus, a human and a dragon who had made a pact (a magical ritual that linked their souls), and fought to try to keep both the Seals and the Goddess safe. Though they ultimately failed, Angelus became the new seal, averting the end of the world. Eighteen years later, the Seals are protected by the Knights of the Seal, who eventually grow to become a dominating force in the land.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, O'Neill {{claimed to}} have {{obtained}} the rights to make a sequel to Summer of '42, based on a short story she wrote, which took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> alternate reality where Herman Raucher had a son and divorced his wife, went back to Nantucket in 1962 with a still-living Oscar Seltzer, and encountered Dorothy again and married her. As of 2017, this project – which O'Neill had hoped to produce with Lifetime television – has not been realized, and it is unknown whether O'Neill is still attempting to get it produced, or if Raucher consented to its production.|$|E

The first six films continue the adventures of the cast of The Original Series; the seventh film, Generations {{was designed as a}} transition from that cast to The Next Generation television series; the next three films, 8–10, focused completely on the Next Generation cast.

This alternate timeline has been named by CBS, for the computer game Star Trek Online, the Kelvin Timeline.|$|E

The Adventure of Links emphasis on side-scrolling and role-playing elements, however, was {{a significant departure from}} its predecessor. , the game remains the only technical sequel to the original title, as all other entries in the series either are prequels or take <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> alternative reality, according to the official Zelda timeline.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of writing}} has made {{language}} even {{more useful to}} humans. It {{makes it possible to}} store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and formal education.|$|E
5|$|With Saltimbanco {{finished}} and touring in the United States and Canada, Cirque du Soleil toured Japan {{in the summer}} of 1992 {{at the behest of the}} Fuji Television Network. Taking acts from Nouvelle Expérience and Cirque Réinventé, they created a show for this tour, titled Fascination. Although Fascination was never seen outside Japan, it represented the first time that Cirque du Soleil had produced a show that took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> arena rather than a big top. It was also the first that Cirque du Soleil performed outside of North America.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{doctrine}} of karma is central to all Indian religions, {{it is difficult to}} say when and where in India the concept of karma originated. In Jainism, it is assumed its development took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> era from which the literary documents are not available, since the basics of this doctrine were present and concluded even in the earliest documents of Jains. Acaranga Sutra and Sutrakritanga, contain a general outline of {{the doctrine}}s of karma and reincarnation. The roots of this doctrine in Jainism might be in the teachings of Parsva, who is said to have lived about two hundred fifty years before Mahavira. The Jain conception of karma—as something material that encumbers the soul—has an archaic nature which justifies the hypothesis that it goes back to 8th or 9th century BCE.|$|E

He became known for syntheses on Norwegian history, and emphasised the roles of peasants and wage labourers as historical agents who found their <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> expanding notion of the Norwegian nation. He was also interested in the United States and its history, and was a pioneer in Norway in this respect.|$|E
5|$|During {{their five}} years in the top division, Maribor played a total of 166matches and {{achieved}} 40wins, 57draws and 69defeats, with a goal difference of 166–270.

5|$|Gods {{were linked}} with {{specific}} {{regions of the}} universe. In Egyptian tradition, the world includes the earth, the sky, and the Duat. Surrounding them is the dark formlessness that existed before creation. The gods in general were said to dwell in the sky, although gods whose roles were linked with {{other parts of the}} universe were said to live in those places instead. Most events of mythology, set in a time before the gods' withdrawal from the human realm, take <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> earthly setting. The deities there sometimes interact with those in the sky. The Duat, in contrast, is treated as a remote and inaccessible place, and the gods who dwell there have difficulty communicating with those {{in the world of the}} living. The space outside the cosmos is also said to be very distant. It too is inhabited by deities, some hostile and some beneficial to the other gods and their orderly world.|$|E
