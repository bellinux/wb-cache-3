5|$|News of {{the death}} spreads, and the interns hurry to his room to find a shocked Stevens, lying on the bed, {{clinging}} to his still form. As they each try to comfort her, {{the cause of his}} death is revealed to have been a blood clot that led to a fatal stroke. Stevens says that if she had taken less time to dress, she would have arrived at his room sooner and could have been with him while he died. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) then talks to Stevens, picking her up and hugging her. Afterward, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), who {{did not know how to}} handle Burke's situation, goes to his room and <b>puts</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> on his to show him her support. As the episode ends, Stevens confesses to Webber that she was the one responsible for the LVAD wire cut, and claiming she cannot be a surgeon, quits the program. After everyone begins going their separate ways, Grey remains torn on who she should follow: Shepherd or Dandridge.|$|E
25|$|One day he {{suddenly}} finds {{the energy to}} get out of bed and rededicates himself to architecture, something Summer had pressured him to do. He makes a list of firms he wants to work for, assembles a portfolio, and goes to job interviews. On day 488, Summer is waiting for Tom at his favorite spot in the city and they talk. Summer explains that Tom was right about true love existing; he was just wrong about it being with her. She says she got married because she felt sure about her husband, something she wasn't with Tom. Summer <b>puts</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> on Tom's and says she is glad to see he is doing well. As she leaves, Tom tells her he really hopes she is happy.|$|E

60|$|After a {{time the}} music ceases, and my wife <b>puts</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> on my shoulder. Perhaps I start a little, and then she says I have been asleep. This is the book of my dreams.|$|E

60|$|DAISY. Amah asked Buddha a {{question}} {{and the answer is}} yes. [She <b>puts</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> to her heart for an instant, then looking at HARRY she smiles.] I'm sorry I was silly and unreasonable just now, Harry.|$|E
