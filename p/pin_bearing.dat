5000|$|In 1977, Buick {{redesigned}} the crankshaft to a [...] "split-pin" [...] configuration {{to create}} an [...] "even-firing" [...] version. The crank pins associated with the opposing cylinders were offset from each other by 30°. The relatively small offset did not require flying arms to be incorporated, however a 3.0 mm thick flange was built in between the offset crank pins to prevent the connecting rod big-ends from [...] "walking" [...] off the crank <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> journal and interfering with the adjacent big end. The 3.0 mm thick flange effectively caused the connecting rods on the left-hand bank of cylinders (forward bank for FWD applications) to move 3.0 mm forward relative to the right-hand bank, but the engine block remained unchanged compared to the odd-fire engine. Since the cylinders center-lines were no longer centralized over the crank <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> journals, the connecting rods were re-designed with the big-ends offset from the piston pin ends by 1.5 mm. The engine in this configuration became known to have [...] "off-centre bore spacing".|$|E

50|$|The ensuing {{investigation}} cited corrosion {{from water}} buildup due to inadequate drainage as a cause. During road mending some 10 years before, the highway drains had been deliberately blocked {{and the crew}} failed to unblock them when the road work was completed. Rainwater leaked down through the <b>pin</b> <b>bearings,</b> causing them to rust. The outer bearings were fracture-critical and non-redundant, a design flaw of this particular type of structure. The bearings were difficult to inspect close-up, although traces of rust could be seen near the affected bearings.|$|R

40|$|Connecting rod and crank <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> are {{important}} components of automotive diesel engine. If these components failed, all of engine {{system would be}} shut down. In this research, these components failed during operation. Detail analysis of the failed surface showed that the failure in connecting rod and crank <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> was caused by improper lubrication system. Evidence of improper lubrication system was proved by the existence of black scratch and chipping on crank <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> which formed by high friction during operation. High friction affects performance of other pistons and therefore bolts of connecting rod experienced dynamic tension load. With repeated load during operation, crack initiated on the bolts and propagated until the bolt could not withstand the load anymore before they are finally broken...|$|E

30|$|In this study, the {{lubrication}} {{performance of}} the crank <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> in a marine two–stroke diesel engine is evaluated to investigate the adhesional failure on the crank <b>pin</b> <b>bearing.</b> A numerical algorithm for the lubrication analysis considering motion analysis of the crank pin system is developed. The film pressure and thickness for three clearances and three lubricant temperatures are calculated. The {{results show that the}} lubricant temperature has a higher effect on film thickness than clearance. In terms of the film parameter, the operating condition that can result in solid–solid contact is investigated. We also suggest the desirable operating conditions of clearance and lubricant temperature to prevent the solid–solid contact.|$|E

A drive system that split the output torque evenly between two nutating plates {{for the purpose of}} reducing the load on each nutating plate was analyzed. Needle bearings were used on the nutating plate pins. The results of the analysis indicate that the required load capacity of the <b>pin</b> <b>bearings</b> and the speed of the nutating plate bearings were beyond the state-of-the-art capacity of rolling-element bearings. The analysis further indicates that the nutating plate drive is less efficient, and results in a higher weight per horsepower than a conventional planetary helicopter transmission with similar design specifications...|$|R

50|$|From 1991 to 1998 the {{connecting}} rods were forged steel with standard type crank <b>pin</b> <b>bearings.</b> SOHC engines, for 1991-1998, used a dished piston design whereas the twin cam engines used a flat top piston with 2 recesses for the intake valves. Twin cam pistons received several re-designs from 1991-2002 {{aimed at reducing}} oil consumption issues. These included reducing the clearance between {{the top of the}} piston and the first compression ring, redesigning the skirts on the pistons and the oiling ports {{on the bottom of the}} pistons. For the 1999 model year all pistons were totally redesigned. Both engines used the flat top pistons with 2 valve recesses and featured a new hypereutectic design with coated skirts. Also for 1999 all connecting rods switched to a powder forged design and cracked bearing caps. The piston pins floated in {{the connecting}} rod bushings. The pistons were cast aluminum alloy with the piston pins being retained with snap rings.|$|R
50|$|A {{bridge bearing}} is a {{component}} of a bridge which typically provides a resting surface between bridge piers and the bridge deck. The purpose of a bearing is to allow controlled movement and thereby reduce the stresses involved. Movement could be thermal expansion or contraction, or movement from other sources such as seismic activity. There are several different types of bridge bearings which are used depending {{on a number of}} different factors including the bridge span. The oldest form of bridge bearing is simply two plates resting on top of each other. A common form of modern bridge bearing is the elastomeric bridge bearing. Another type of bridge bearing is the mechanical bridge bearing. There are several types of mechanical bridge bearing, such as the <b>pinned</b> <b>bearing,</b> which in turn includes specific types such as the rocker bearing, and the roller bearing. Another type of mechanical bearing is the fixed bearing, which allows rotation, but not other forms of movement.|$|R
