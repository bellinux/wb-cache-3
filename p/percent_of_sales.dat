However, these profits {{are based on the}} assumption that the unpaid water charges billed to PAM Jaya will be fully paid to the operators. Actually, these charges are not being paid and writing off these unpaid bills, as it may become necessary, would significantly reduce the profits shown on the financial statements of the companies.|$|E

500|$|By 1967, KFC {{had become}} the sixth largest {{restaurant}} chain in the US by sales volume, and 30 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> were take-out. Brown felt {{that the company had}} to expand quickly, or else emerging rivals such as Church's Chicken would steal the company's lead; 863 outlets were opened in 1968. The company's growth pushed its stock value to [...] "stratospheric" [...] levels, according to Reuters, and in 1969 it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, KFC entered into ventures with other companies. Brown believed that the Colonel Sanders brand could be used to market anything, and launched the [...] "Kentucky Roast Beef" [...] restaurant chain, and [...] "Colonel Sanders Inns" [...] motels. The two ventures quickly failed, although the roast beef chain had 100 outlets by 1970. That same year, KFC entered a joint venture with the California-based fish and chips chain H.

The New York Times acknowledged that promotion was stronger internationally, where Jackson had more commercial force and popularity.
