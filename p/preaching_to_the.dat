5|$|Baeyertz's {{husband died}} on 6 March 1871 {{at the age}} of 28, two days after a {{shooting}} accident. She turned to the Anglican church to help her and she experienced a full conversion to the religion. She put her children into boarding school and became an evangelist, visiting jails and hospitals to spread the religion, as well as door-to-door <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jewish areas of Melbourne. She did not manage to convert anyone, and ended up with her life threatened.|$|E
5|$|Coolsma left Cianjur in 1869 {{and went}} to Bogor, also a majority-Sundanese city. He found little success in <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> European {{citizens}} of the city or converting the Sundanese. On 31 May 1869, he opened a school at his home, which provided a free education in both secular and religious studies. The first class had ten students, a total which grew quickly; at its peak, the school had 111 students. After a government-funded school was opened in 1872, most of the Sundanese students moved there to avoid the Christian teachings. The remaining students were mostly ethnic Chinese, few of whom converted.|$|E
5|$|In 1842 the Treaty of Nanking was concluded, which {{included}} among its provisions {{the creation of}} treaty ports in which Christian missionaries {{would be free to}} preach. Xiamen (then known as Amoy) was one of these treaty ports, and British, Canadian and American missionaries moved in to start <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local inhabitants. These missionaries, housed in the cantonment of Gulangyu, created reference works and religious tracts, including a bible translation. Naturally, they based the pronunciation of their romanization on the speech of Xiamen, which became the de facto standard when they eventually moved into other areas of the Hokkien Sprachraum, most notably Taiwan. The 1858 Treaty of Tianjin officially opened Taiwan to western missionaries, and missionary societies were quick to send men to work in the field, usually after a sojourn in Xiamen to acquire the rudiments of the language.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-1780s, Rapp {{had begun}} <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Separatists, his {{followers}} in Iptengen, who met privately {{and refused to}} attend church services or take communion. As their numbers increased, Rapp’s group officially split with the Lutheran Church in 1785 and was banned from meeting. Despite warnings from local authorities, the group continued to meet privately and attract even more followers.|$|E
25|$|Early campaigns {{were focused}} on Disney, Starbucks, Walmart, chain stores, and sweatshops. In one early action, Talen and his {{associates}} pretended to be shopping at the store and talking on non-functional cell phones, carrying on increasingly loud conversations about the evils of Disney and its products. Once the ruse was discovered, Reverend Billy began <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> actual consumers until the police removed him from the store.|$|E

25|$|William Forbes Skene {{argued in}} 1837 that Pictish was a Goidelic language, the {{ancestor}} of modern Scottish Gaelic. He suggested that Columba's {{use of an}} interpreter reflected his <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Picts in Latin, rather than any difference between the Irish and Pictish languages. This view, involving independent settlement of Ireland and Scotland by Goidelic people, obviated an Irish influence {{in the development of}} Gaelic Scotland and enjoyed wide popular acceptance in 19th century Scotland, but is no longer given credence.|$|E
25|$|Church restorations {{were also}} {{strongly}} influenced by the Oxford Movement, which advocated moving the centre of importance in the church from <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sacrament of the Eucharist: from the pulpit to the altar. Consequences of this included moving the pulpit from a more central position {{to the side of}} the church, replacing box pews with open pews, creating a central aisle to give a better view of the altar, and the removal of galleries. Another consequence was that a larger chancel was required for the associated ritual.|$|E

25|$|In 1528, Friar Matteo {{obtained}} {{the approval of}} Pope Clement VII and was given permission to live as a hermit and to go about everywhere <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poor. These permissions were not only for himself, but for all such as might join him {{in the attempt to}} restore the most literal observance possible of the Rule of St. Francis. Matteo and the original band were soon joined by others. Matteo and his companions were formed into a separate province, called the Hermit Friars Minor, as a branch of the Conventual Franciscans, but with a Vicar Provincial of their own, subject to the jurisdiction of the Minister General of the Conventuals. The Observants, the other branch of the Franciscan Order at that time, continued to oppose the movement.|$|E
25|$|Abraham's {{personality}} and character {{is one of}} the most in-depth in the whole Quran, and Abraham is specifically mentioned as being a kind and compassionate man. Abraham's father is understood by Muslims to have been a wicked, ignorant and idolatrous man who ignored all of his son's advice. The relationship between Abraham and his father, who in the Quran is named Azar, is central to Abraham's story as Muslims understand it to establish a large part of Abraham's personality. The Quran mentions that Abraham's father threatened to stone his son to death if he did not cease in <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people. Despite this, the Qur'an states that Abraham in his later years prayed to God to forgive the sins of all his descendants and his parents. Muslims have frequently cited Abraham's character as an example of how kind one must be towards people, and especially one's own parents. A similar example of Abraham's compassionate nature is demonstrated when Abraham began to pray for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah after hearing of God's plan through the angel Gabriel for them. Although the angel Gabriel told Abraham that God's plan was the final word, and therefore Abraham's prayers would be of no effect, the Quran nonetheless reinforces Abraham's kind nature through this particular event.|$|E
500|$|Unlike common {{proselytising}} movements, has TJ mostly {{focused on}} making Muslims 'better and purer' and ideally [...] "religiously perfect", rather than <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> non-Muslims.

50|$|Coughlan’s {{family is}} {{more in line with}} the {{traditional}} Irishmen of the 18th century, real Hibernians. He too was born in Drumsna, but unlike Robert Strawbridge, Coughlan did not experience the benefits of education like Robert. Despite this limited beginning, Coughlan finds himself drawn and changed by the words of the Bible. His exposure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sacred texts comes by through the efforts of John Wesley’s itinerants in the year 1753. His birth anew moves him to vigorously gain knowledge of the word. These efforts create a deep urge for him <b>to</b> <b>preach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants of Drumsna. John Wesley, hearing of the young man’s efforts recruits him just two years later. Another twelve months later and Coughlan departs Ireland of his own doing <b>to</b> <b>preach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fishermen of Newfoundland.|$|R
500|$|This was a tour {{de force}} for sure– but an indulgent one. It didn’t unlock {{anything}} substantially new to Dot. [...] Far from making us care more about Dot– we do anyway, it was <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> converted– it was a little, well, dull. Boring even. [...] he episode revealed a nagging weakness: Coronation Street has a fine repertory of older characters and actors which gives the show its wonderful link to the past. In EastEnders, the same gatekeeping roles are played by Dot and Ian Beale: she is a jewel but, as she said, an all-too lonely one. Cherish her, absolutely, but don’t turn her into a drag act.|$|E

500|$|CommLaw Conspectus of The Catholic University of America noted, [...] "Cyber Rights brims with anecdotes and behind-the-scenes {{looks at}} the people and {{organizations}} struggling with the [...] and potential of the information superhighway." [...] A review of the book in The Green Bag concluded, [...] "Overall, Godwin seems to be <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> choir, rather than making legal arguments to win over converts. Lower publication costs do increase the possibility of publication, but, standing alone, may not justify replacing the legal regimes developed over time to regulate expression – legal regimes which, for the most part, have endured through previous revolutions in the technology of disseminating information. Theology, which calls on faith, and economics, which calls on reason and empiricism, may not be compatible. But the Internet is about {{a shift in the}} economics of expression, not a theological revolution in how the First Amendment affects society, and when the project is getting the legal prescriptions right, all of the implications must be taken seriously." ...|$|E

500|$|Stephanie Zacharek, {{writing for}} Salon.com {{said that with}} regard to issues of sexual {{orientation}} and homophobia, Babbit is <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> converted. Cynthia Fuchs, for NitrateOnline.com, agreed, stating that [...] "no one who is phobic might recognize himself in the film" [...] and that [...] "the audience who might benefit most from watching it either won't see the film or won't see the point." [...] David Edelstein said that the one sidedness of the film creates a lack of dramatic tension and calls it lazy counterpropaganda. In contrast, LaSalle said that [...] "the picture manages to make a heartfelt statement about the difficulties of growing up gay" [...] and Timothy Shary said that the film openly challenges homophobia and offers support to teenaged gay viewers. Chris Holmlund said that the film shows that queer identity is multi-faceted, using as an example the scene where the ex-ex-gays tell Megan {{that there is no}} one way to be a lesbian.|$|E

500|$|Jones {{was raised}} by his mother Tuhbenahneequay in the {{traditional}} culture and religion of the Mississauga Ojibwas {{until the age of}} 14. [...] After that, he went to live with his father Augustus Jones, a Welsh-born United Empire Loyalist. [...] There he learnt the customs and language of the white Christian settlers of Upper Canada and was taught how to farm. [...] Jones converted to Methodism at age 21 after attending a camp-meeting with his half sister. [...] Methodist leaders in Upper Canada recognised his potential as a bridge between the white and Indian communities and recruited him as a preacher. [...] As a bilingual and bicultural preacher, he enabled the Methodists to make significant inroads with the Mississaugas and Iroquois of Upper Canada, both by translating hymns and biblical texts in Ojibwe and Mohawk and by preaching to Indians who did not understand English. [...] Beyond his <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Indians of Upper Canada, he was an excellent fundraiser for the Canadian Methodists, and toured the United States and Great Britain giving sermons and speeches. [...] Jones drew audiences of thousands, filling many of the buildings he spoke in, but came to resent the role, believing the audiences came to see Kahkewāquonāby, the exotic Indian, not Peter Jones, the good Christian he had worked so hard to become.|$|E
