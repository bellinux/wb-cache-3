In contrast to the widespread conception that <b>prior</b> <b>consultation</b> is a means for preventing and resolving conflict, it argues that this new legislation will not help to transform conflicts as long as the normative framework itself is contested and the preconditions for participatory governance are not in place. Establishing these preconditions would result in state institutions capable of justly balancing the diverse interests at stake; measures that reduce power asymmetries within consultations; and joint decision-making processes with binding agreements...|$|R
40|$|The aim {{with this}} study was to {{investigate}} the communication that takes place in public <b>consultation</b> <b>meetings.</b> My intention was to study and analyze both attitudes about the communication, as well as the factual behavior at the meetings, in order to found possible potential for improvement. In order to fulfill my aim I interviewed six people that were working with public <b>consultation</b> <b>meetings</b> in one way or another. I also observed three public <b>consultation</b> <b>meetings.</b> The information provided to me by the interviewees corresponded quite well with my own observations. The overall conclusion I have reached is that there are many potential changes from which the communication in public <b>consultation</b> <b>meetings</b> would gain. In many aspects the meetings I observed were not conducted in a democratic way and the meetings had more in common with meetings of information rather than meetings of dialogue. However both participants and process leaders would like to see more influence given to the participants and in this study I suggest that by doing so, several communication problems could be avoided at the same time as it would deepen democracy and give greater legitimacy to decisions that is being taken in relation to the meetings. Suggestively, this increased influence could be gained by letting the participants take part in deciding about the agenda for the meetings. The them-and-us feeling, which according to my findings also leads to communicational difficulties, could also be reduced with the participants’ greater influence. The meetings I observed and the interviews I conducted were all related to very different consultation situation. The study and its conclusion therefore become quite general. The need for some kind of change in all of the meetings however indicates that it would be interesting to look even further into each case and I believe that the meetings would gain from compiling my specific findings with the process leaders understanding of the meetings. I suggest that all people in the position of leading public <b>consultation</b> <b>meetings</b> should think and reflect upon the democratic aspects as well as the purpose of such meetings in order to improve their execution...|$|R
