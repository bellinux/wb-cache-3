5|$|The {{preservation}} of Gibraltar's fortifications, {{and of its}} architectural heritage in general, has been a problematic issue. The peninsula is extremely short of land; in the early 1980s, nearly half the available land was in military usage, comprising the naval dockyard, {{the whole of the}} southern part of Gibraltar, {{the upper part of the}} Rock and a significant amount of property within the city walls, in addition to the runway and military facilities on the isthmus. Until recently, Gibraltar had no public sea front of its own due to military land usage. As the military presence has been run down, MOD property has been handed over to the Government of Gibraltar but the latter has lacked the resources to look after all of the buildings and land that have been transferred. This has led to the abandonment and severe <b>physical</b> <b>deterioration</b> of significant parts of Gibraltar's military heritage.|$|E
5|$|Ruth had {{two hits}} {{in the second game}} of the season, but it quickly went {{downhill}} both for him and the Braves from there. The season soon settled down to a routine of Ruth performing poorly on the few occasions he even played at all, and the Braves lost most of their games. As April passed into May, Ruth's <b>physical</b> <b>deterioration</b> became even more pronounced. While he remained productive at the plate early on, he could do little else. His conditioning had become so poor that he could barely trot around the bases. He made so many errors that three Braves pitchers told McKechnie that they would not take the mound if he was in the lineup. Before long, Ruth stopped hitting as well. He grew increasingly annoyed that McKechnie ignored most of his advice. For his part, McKechnie later said that Ruth's huge salary and refusal to stay with the team while on the road made it nearly impossible to enforce discipline.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{search for}} {{techniques}} and materials able to improve structure quality and durability has lead to research some methods that {{are able to}} measure the transfer properties of composites. Cement type has an important influence on mortar performance, and chemical and <b>physical</b> <b>deteriorations</b> modify microstructure, and thereby transfer properties. The aim of this work is to evaluate two methods which can measure the transfer properties of cement based materials: capillary absorption and air permeability tests in mortars produced with blastfurnace slag Portland cement. The relationship between these two methods was investigated. The mortars were submitted to steam curing (60 ºC) and standard curing. Results show that steam curing improved initial compressive strength. At 28 days all mortars had the same performance. Water absorption coefficient and air permeability was higher for steam cured mortars. There was a significant correlation between both tests results...|$|R
25|$|The {{business}} practices of redlining, mortgage discrimination, and racially restrictive covenants {{contributed to the}} overcrowding and <b>physical</b> <b>deterioration</b> of areas where minorities chose to congregate. Such conditions are considered to {{have contributed to the}} emigration of other populations. The limited facilities for banking and insurance, due to a perceived lack of profitability, and other social services, and extra fees meant to hedge against perceived profit issues increased their cost to residents in predominantly non-white suburbs and city neighborhoods. According to the environmental geographer Laura Pulido, the historical processes of suburbanization and urban decentralization contribute to contemporary environmental racism.|$|E
25|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} chapter in Ball's business career was his {{battle against the}} railroad unions in the Florida East Coast Railway strike of 1963 to 1977. In {{order to try to}} save the railroad from its three decades-long state of bankruptcy, which if allowed to continue would have threatened the railroad with <b>physical</b> <b>deterioration</b> and even partial abandonment, Ball fought for the company's right to engage in its own contract negotiations with the railroad unions rather than accept an industrywide settlement that Ball thought would include featherbedding and wasteful work rules. His use of replacement workers to keep the railroad running during the strike led to violence by strikers that included shootings and bombings. Eventually, Federal intervention helped quell the violence, and the railroad's right to operate during the strike with replacement workers was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court. As the strike continued, the Florida East Coast took numerous steps to improve its physical plant, install various forms of automation, and drastically cut labor costs, all to an extent that most other railroads would not succeed in matching until years later. Ball therefore was a pioneer in the American railroad industry's struggle, beginning in the 1960s, to improve its economic efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Mexico gained its {{independence}} from Spain in 1821. The 1820s and 30s saw a gradual decline in the Mission's status. Disease thinned out the once ample cattle herds, and a sudden infestation of mustard weed made {{it increasingly difficult to}} cultivate crops. Floods and droughts took their toll as well. But the biggest threat to the Mission's stability came from the presence of Spanish settlers who sought to take over Capistrano's fertile lands. Over time the disillusioned Indian population gradually left the Mission, and without regular maintenance its <b>physical</b> <b>deterioration</b> continued at an accelerated rate. Nevertheless, there was sufficient activity along El Camino Real to justify the construction of the Las Flores Asistencia in 1823. This facility, situated halfway between San Juan Capistrano and the Mission at San Luis Rey, was intended to act primarily as a rest stop for traveling clergy. Around 1820 an estancia (station) was established a few miles north {{on the banks of the}} Santa Ana River to accommodate the Mission's sizeable cattle herd. The adobe structure built to house the mayordomo and vaqueros (cowboys) who tended the Mission herds is known today as the Diego Sepúlveda Adobe. Upon his death in 1825, Don José Antonio Yorba I (a prominent Spanish land owner and member of the Portolà Expedition), was buried in the Mission's ceremony in an unmarked grave; a cenotaph was later placed in Yorba's honor.|$|E

Alarmed, Laura sought help from her friend, Frances Donaldson, whose husband agreed to fly out to Ceylon and bring Waugh home. In fact, Waugh made his own way back, now believing that he was being possessed by devils. A brief medical examination indicated that Waugh was suffering from bromide poisoning from his drugs regimen. When his medication was changed, the voices and the other hallucinations quickly disappeared. Waugh was delighted, informing all of his friends that he had been mad: [...] "Clean off my onion!". The experience was [...] fictionalised a few years later, in The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold (1957).|$|E

Hemingway's injuries included a head wound, while Mary broke two ribs. The next day, attempting to reach medical care in Entebbe, they boarded a second plane that exploded at take-off, with Hemingway suffering burns and another concussion, this one serious enough to cause leaking of cerebral fluid. They eventually arrived in Entebbe to find reporters covering the story of Hemingway's death. He briefed the reporters {{and spent the next}} few weeks recuperating and reading his erroneous obituaries. Despite his injuries, Hemingway accompanied Patrick and his wife on a planned fishing expedition in February, but pain caused him to be irascible and difficult to get along with. When a bushfire broke out, he was again injured, sustaining second degree burns on his legs, front torso, lips, left hand and right forearm.
