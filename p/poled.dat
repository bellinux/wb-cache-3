40|$|Abstract. In the <b>poling</b> {{process of}} PZT ceramics, the <b>poling</b> {{temperature}} {{is a critical}} condition. When the <b>poling</b> temperature is too low, no matter how high is the <b>poling</b> field and how long is the <b>poling</b> time, the planar electromechanical coupling factor kp is lower. When the <b>poling</b> temperature is higher enough, the kp can reach to a saturated value with a lower <b>poling</b> field and short <b>poling</b> time. The variation of dielectric constant with the <b>poling</b> conditions {{is the same as}} that of planar electromechanical coupling factor. When <b>poling</b> with a low temperature, the dielectric constant after <b>poling</b> is lower than 1400. When <b>poling</b> with higher temperature, no matter how high is the <b>poling</b> field and how long is the <b>poling</b> time, the dielectric constant after <b>poling</b> is higher than 1500...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{not yet fully}} understood event in DNA replication is the DNA polymerase (<b>pol)</b> switch from <b>pol</b> alpha to <b>pol</b> delta. Indirect evidence suggested that the clamp loader replication factor C (RF-C) plays an important role, since a replication competent protein complex containing <b>pol</b> alpha, <b>pol</b> delta and RF-C could perform <b>pol</b> switching {{in the presence of}} proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). By using purified <b>pol</b> alpha/primase, <b>pol</b> delta, RF-C, PCNA and RP-A we show that: (i) RF-C can inhibit <b>pol</b> alpha in the presence of ATP prior to PCNA loading, (ii) RF-C decreases the affinity of <b>pol</b> alpha for the 3 'OH primer ends, (iii) the inhibition of <b>pol</b> alpha by RF-C is released upon PCNA loading, (iv) ATP hydrolysis is required for PCNA loading and subsequent release of inhibition of <b>pol</b> alpha, (v) under these conditions a switching from <b>pol</b> alpha/primase to <b>pol</b> delta is evident. Thus, RF-C appears to be critical for the <b>pol</b> alpha to <b>pol</b> delta switching. Based on these results, a model is proposed in which RF-C induces the <b>pol</b> switching by sequestering the 3 '-OH end from <b>pol</b> alpha and subsequently recruiting PCNA to DNA...|$|R
40|$|Translesion DNA {{synthesis}} (TLS) by specialized DNA polymerases (<b>Pols)</b> is a conserved {{mechanism for}} tolerating replication blocking DNA lesions. The actions of TLS <b>Pols</b> are managed {{in part by}} ring-shaped sliding clamp proteins. In addition to catalyzing TLS, altered expression of TLS <b>Pols</b> impedes cellular growth. The goal {{of this study was}} to define the relationship between the physiological function of Escherichia coli <b>Pol</b> IV in TLS and its ability to impede growth when overproduced. To this end, 13 novel <b>Pol</b> IV mutants were identified that failed to impede growth. Subsequent analysis of these mutants suggest that overproduced levels of <b>Pol</b> IV inhibit E. coli growth by gaining inappropriate access to the replication fork via a <b>Pol</b> III-Pol IV switch that is mechanistically similar to that used under physiological conditions to coordinate <b>Pol</b> IV-catalyzed TLS with <b>Pol</b> III-catalyzed replication. Detailed analysis of one mutant, <b>Pol</b> IV-T 120 P, and two previously described <b>Pol</b> IV mutants impaired for interaction with either the rim (<b>Pol</b> IVR) or the cleft (<b>Pol</b> IVC) of the β sliding clamp revealed novel insights into the mechanism of the <b>Pol</b> III-Pol IV switch.

The activity of <b>Pol</b> II and the purified <b>Pol</b> II complexes in transcription initiation and reinitiation was investigated by supplementing extracts depleted of either total <b>Pol</b> II or total TFIIF with purified <b>Pol</b> II or the <b>Pol</b> II complexes.
