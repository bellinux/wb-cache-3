40|$|A new, {{simple and}} {{fit for purpose}} method based on liquid {{chromatography}} with UV spectrophotometric detection and post-column derivatisation (LC-UV-PCD) for the determination of semduramicin in poultry compound feed, <b>premixtures</b> <b>and</b> feed additive {{as well as its}} discrimination from other coccidiostats in poultry compound feed has been developed and single-laboratory validated. The concentration levels of the target analyte at which the validation experiments have been carried out varied between 12. 8 and 51. 3 mg kg− 1 in compound feed, covering the authorised levels of semduramicin according to European Union legislation. Furthermore, the method has been validated for a premixture sample containing semduramicin at 3 g kg− 1 and the feed additive containing semduramicin at 51 g kg− 1. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the coccidiostats with acetonitrile from the feed samples followed by a filtration of the supernatants. The resulting supernatants were submitted to chromatographic analysis. When analysing the feed additive <b>and</b> the <b>premixture</b> samples, the extraction solution was appropriately diluted prior to LC-UV-PCD analysis. The analytes were quantified through an external calibration curve prepared with pure semduramicin standards. The relative standard deviations for repeatability and for intermediate precision varied from 2. 4 to 8. 8 % and from 2. 6 to 8. 8 %, respectively, and the values for the relative recovery rate ranged from 89 to 95 %. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were estimated to be below 1 mg kg− 1 and 3 mg kg− 1, respectively. Moreover, the results showed a comparable performance profile, when using methyl isobutyl ketone instead of acetonitrile as extraction solvent. Based on the obtained method performance characteristics, the method is considered suitable for the determination of semduramicin in poultry compound feed at authorised level, in <b>premixtures</b> <b>and</b> in the feed additive, hence allowing the enforcement of the European Union legislation regarding the control and the monitoring in feedingstuffs.

40|$|To {{understand}} the relationship of food shopping <b>and</b> <b>preparation</b> of USDA Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education (SNAP-Ed) key nutrition messages have on other key nutrition messages, a quasi-experimental design was developed using data from Minnesota’s 2012 SNAP-Ed evaluation system. SNAP-Ed participants attended a series of nutrition education classes delivered by Extension staff along with schools and community-based organizations and completed a retrospective evaluation survey. Correlations {{were used to assess}} self-reported changes for the food shopping <b>and</b> <b>preparation</b> key message. Results found that food shopping <b>and</b> <b>preparation</b> key message was significantly correlated with other key messages and mediation association of food shopping <b>and</b> <b>preparation</b> with low-fat calcium-rich foods, limiting added sugar, food safety and increasing physical activity were also significant. Food shopping <b>and</b> <b>preparation</b> key message is relevant when discussing other nutrition concepts and in future program development and research...|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The {{implementation}} of automated dispensing cabinets (ADCs) in healthcare facilities {{appears to be}} increasing, in particular within Australian hospital emergency departments (EDs). While the investment in ADCs is on the increase, no studies have specifically investigated the impacts of ADCs on medication selection <b>and</b> <b>preparation</b> error rates in EDs. Our aim {{was to assess the}} impact of ADCs on medication selection <b>and</b> <b>preparation</b> error rates in an ED of a tertiary teaching hospital. METHODS: Pre intervention and post intervention study involving direct observations of nurses completing medication selection <b>and</b> <b>preparation</b> activities before <b>and</b> after the {{implementation of}} ADCs in the original and new emergency departments within a 377 -bed tertiary teaching hospital in Australia. Medication selection <b>and</b> <b>preparation</b> error rates were calculated and compared between these two periods. Secondary end points included the impact on medication error type and severity. RESULTS: A total of 2087 medication selection <b>and</b> <b>preparations</b> were observed among 808 patients pre and post intervention. Implementation of ADCs in the new ED resulted in a 64. 7 % (1. 96 % versus 0. 69 %, respectively, P =  0. 017) reduction in medication selection <b>and</b> <b>preparation</b> errors. All medication error types were reduced in the post intervention study period. There was an insignificant impact on medication error severity as all errors detected were categorised as minor. CONCLUSION: The implementation of ADCs could reduce medication selection <b>and</b> <b>preparation</b> errors <b>and</b> improve medication safety in an ED setting...|$|R
