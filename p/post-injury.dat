5|$|Much {{research}} has been done into erection. By two years <b>post-injury,</b> 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function, though many experience problems with the reliability and duration of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them. Studies have found that half or up to 65% of men with SCI have orgasms, although the experience may feel different than it did before the injury. Most men say it feels weaker, and takes longer and more stimulation to achieve.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease has}} been {{identified}} as a protein misfolding disease (proteopathy), caused by plaque accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta protein, and tau protein in the brain. Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39–43amino acids in length, called amyloid beta (Aβ). Aβ is a fragment from the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival, and <b>post-injury</b> repair. In Alzheimer's disease, gamma secretase and beta secretase act together in a proteolytic process which causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of amyloid beta, which then form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} women with SCI giving birth and having healthy babies are increasing. Around a half to two-thirds of women with SCI report {{they might want to}} have children, and 14–20% do get {{pregnant}} at least once. Although female fertility is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a stress response that can happen immediately <b>post-injury</b> that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body. In about half of women, menstruation stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within a year for a large majority. After menstruation returns, women with SCI become pregnant at a rate close to that {{of the rest of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|In mid-December, as Totti began regaining form <b>post-injury,</b> {{he started}} playing more regularly, {{often in a}} {{creative}} role as an attacking midfielder. On 12 December, he set up Daniele De Rossi's opening goal in a 1–1 home draw against eventual league champions Juventus, although Totti missed a second-half penalty during the match. He provided several more assists that season, notably for Dani Osvaldo's goal in Roma's 3–1 win over Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo on 18 December 2011, and also set up De Rossi's goal against Catania at the Massimino stadium. Playing in a deeper position on the pitch, the Roma talisman did not seek to score goals as often, opting rather to play more of a supporting role by bridging the gap between attack and midfield, using his presence, leadership and experience in games to offer some much needed depth to the team.|$|E
5|$|SCI is {{extremely}} disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens to young people, {{who are at}} a peak in their sexual and reproductive lives. Yet the importance of sexuality {{as a part of}} life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function. Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life <b>post-injury.</b> People who are able to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better overall quality of life.|$|E
25|$|Astrocytes are glial {{cells that}} are {{abundant}} in {{the central nervous system}}. They are crucial for the metabolic and trophic support of neurons; additionally, astrocytes provide ion buffering and neurotransmitter clearance. Growing axons are guided by cues created by astrocytes; thus, astrocytes can regulate neurite pathfinding and subsequently, patterning in the developing brain. The glial scar that forms <b>post-injury</b> in the central nervous system is formed by astrocytes and fibroblasts; it is the most significant obstacle for regeneration. The glial scar consists of hypertrophied astrocytes, connective tissue, and ECM. Two goals of neural tissue engineering are to understand astrocyte function and to develop control over astrocytic growth. Studies by Shany et al. (2006) have demonstrated that astrocyte survival rates are increased on 3D aragonite matrices compared to conventional 2D cell cultures. The ability of cell processes to stretch out across curves and pores allows for the formation of multiple cell layers with complex 3D configurations.|$|E
25|$|Further {{studies on}} the effects of {{morphine}} on the immune system have shown that morphine influences the production of neutrophils and other cytokines. Since cytokines are produced as part of the immediate immunological response (inflammation), {{it has been suggested that}} they may also influence pain. In this way, cytokines may be a logical target for analgesic development. Recently, one study has used an animal model (hind-paw incision) to observe the effects of morphine administration on the acute immunological response. Following hind-paw incision, pain thresholds and cytokine production were measured. Normally, cytokine production in and around the wounded area increases in order to fight infection and control healing (and, possibly, to control pain), but pre-incisional morphine administration (0.1mg/kg to 10.0mg/kg) reduced the number of cytokines found around the wound in a dose-dependent manner. The authors suggest that morphine administration in the acute <b>post-injury</b> period may reduce resistance to infection and may impair the healing of the wound.|$|E
25|$|Phosphodiesterase 4 is {{a member}} of the {{phosphodiesterase}} family of proteins that cleave phosphodiester bonds. This is an important step in degrading cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a major intracellular signaling molecule; conversely, blocking PDE4 will increase cAMP. Increased intracellular cAMP levels in neurons has been previously shown to induce axonal growth. In 2004, Nikulina et al. showed that administration of rolipram, a PDE4 inhibitor, can increase cAMP levels in neurons after spinal cord injury. This is partially possible because rolipram is sufficiently small to pass through the blood–brain barrier and immediately begin to catalyze reactions in neurons. 10 day administration of rolipram in spinal cord injured rodents resulted in considerable axonal growth associated with a reduction in glial scarring at 2 weeks <b>post-injury.</b> The mechanism for this reduction in glial scarring is currently unknown, but possible mechanisms include axonal extensions that physically prevent reactive astrocytes from proliferating, as well as chemical signaling events to reduce reactive astrogliosis.|$|E
25|$|On January 20, 2016, Tom Brady {{announced}} {{the launch of}} his peak performance website TB12Sports.com. The site features information on Tom Brady’s training regimen and includes a store to purchase TB12 equipment and merchandise. Later in the year, on August 23, 2016, the TB12 brand then expanded to offer a snack line. The snacks contain raw, vegan, and organic ingredients that are also free of gluten and dairy. The following month, Brady, alongside Boston Private and Robert Paul Properties, {{announced the}} formation of the TB12 Foundation. The purpose of the nonprofit foundation is to provide free <b>post-injury</b> rehabilitation care and training to underprivileged, young athletes. In March 2017, Brady moved beyond his snack line and partnered with meal-kit startup Purple Carrot to offer his own line of TB12 Performance Meals. The meals utilize whole foods and focus on providing nutrients for workout recovery. On September 19, 2017, Simon & Schuster published Brady's first book, The TB12 Method: How to Achieve a Lifetime of Sustained Peak Performance. Within 48 hours, it had become a number one best-seller on Amazon.com. The book also reached #1 on the New York Times' weekly Best Sellers list, to be featured in the October 8, 2017 edition.|$|E
500|$|One {{important}} {{predictor of}} motor recovery {{in an area}} is presence of sensation there, particularly pain perception. Most motor recovery occurs {{in the first year}} <b>post-injury,</b> but modest improvements can continue for years; sensory recovery is more limited. [...] Recovery is typically quickest during the first six months. Spinal shock, in which reflexes are suppressed, occurs immediately after the injury and resolves largely within three months but continues resolving gradually for another 15.|$|E
500|$|Chest X-ray is {{the most}} common method used for {{diagnosis}}, and may be used to confirm a diagnosis already made using clinical signs. [...] Consolidated areas appear white on an X-ray film. [...] Contusion is not typically restricted by the anatomical boundaries of the lobes or segments of the lung. [...] The X-ray appearance of pulmonary contusion {{is similar to that of}} aspiration, and the presence of hemothorax or pneumothorax may obscure the contusion on a radiograph. Signs of contusion that progress after 48hours <b>post-injury</b> are likely to be actually due to aspiration, pneumonia, or ARDS.|$|E
500|$|Adjusting to <b>post-injury</b> {{changes in}} the body's {{sensation}} is difficult enough to cause some {{to give up on}} the idea of satisfying sex at first. But changes in sensitivity above and at the level of injury occur over time; people may find erogenous zones like the nipples or ears have become more sensitive, enough to be sexually satisfying. They may discover new erogenous zones that were not erotic before the injury; care providers can help direct this discovery. These erogenous areas can even lead to orgasm when stimulated. Such changes may result from [...] "remapping" [...] of sensory areas in the brain due to neuroplasticity, particularly when sensation in the genitals is completely lost.|$|E
500|$|... and {{the numbers}} who report being sexually {{satisfied}} range from 40–88%. Although women's satisfaction is usually lower than before the injury, it improves as time passes. Women report higher rates of sexual satisfaction than men post-SCI {{for as many as}} 10–45 years. More than a quarter of men have substantial problems with adjustment to their <b>post-injury</b> sexual functioning. Sexual satisfaction depends on a host of factors, some more important than the physical function of the genitals: intimacy, quality of relationships, satisfaction of partners, willingness to be sexually experimental, and good communication. Genital function is not as important to men's sexual satisfaction as are their partners' satisfaction and intimacy in their relationships. For women, quality of relationships, closeness with partners, sexual desire, and positive body image, as well as the physical function of the genitals, contribute sexual satisfaction. For both sexes, long-term relationships are associated with higher sexual satisfaction.|$|E
500|$|Pulmonary {{contusion}} usually resolves itself {{without causing}} permanent complications; however {{it may also}} have long-term ill effects on respiratory function. Most contusions resolve in five to sevendays after the injury. [...] Signs detectable by radiography are usually gone within 10days after the injury—when they are not, other conditions, such as pneumonia, are the likely cause. [...] Chronic lung disease correlates {{with the size of}} the contusion and can interfere with an individual's ability to return to work. Fibrosis of the lungs can occur, resulting in dyspnea (shortness of breath), low blood oxygenation, and reduced functional residual capacity for as long as six years after the injury. As late as four years <b>post-injury,</b> decreased functional residual capacity has been found in most pulmonary contusion patients studied. During the six months after pulmonary contusion, up to 90% of people suffer difficulty breathing. In some cases, dyspnea persists for an indefinite period. [...] Contusion can also permanently reduce the compliance of the lungs.|$|E
2500|$|The way {{in which}} {{children}} cope with the injury after it occurs may have more of an impact than factors that existed prior to the injury. [...] Children's mechanisms for dealing with their injuries may {{have an effect on}} the duration of symptoms, and parents who do not deal effectively with anxiety about children's <b>post-injury</b> functioning may be less able to help their children recover.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{not known}} exactly how common PCS is. [...] Estimates of the {{prevalence}} at 3months <b>post-injury</b> are between 24 and 84%, a variation possibly caused by different populations or study methodologies. The estimated incidence of PPCS (persistent postconcussive syndrome) is around 10% of mTBI cases. [...] Since PCS by definition only exists in people who have suffered a head injury, demographics and risk factors {{are similar to those}} for head injury; for example, young adults are at higher risk than others for receiving head injury, and, consequently, of developing PCS.|$|E
2500|$|Nestin is an {{intermediate}} filament (IF) protein that assists with IF polymerization and macromolecule stability. Intermediate filaments {{are an integral}} part of cell motility, a requirement for any large migration or cellular reaction. Nestin is normally present during (CNS) development and reactivates after minor stresses to the nervous system. However, Frisen et al. determined that nestin is also upregulated during severe stresses such as lesions which involve the formation of the glial scar. [...] Mid-thoracic spinal cord lesions, optic nerve lesions, but not lesions to the sciatic nerve, have shown marked increases in nestin expression within the first 48 hours after trauma. Further, nestin upregulation was shown to last for up to 13 months <b>post-injury.</b> This data suggests that nestin upregulation may be associated with CNS glial scarring.|$|E
2500|$|While {{sometimes}} {{only the}} cytoskeleton is disturbed, frequently {{disruption of the}} axolemma occurs as well, causing the influx of Ca2+ into the cell and unleashing a variety of degrading processes. An increase in Ca2+ and Na+ levels and a drop in K+ levels is found within the axon directly after injury. [...] Possible routes of Ca2+ entry include sodium channels, pores torn in the membrane during stretch, and failure of ATP-dependent transporters due to mechanical blockage or lack of energy. [...] High levels of intracellular Ca2+, the major cause of <b>post-injury</b> cell damage, and BBB permeability and ultrastructure in head injury with secondary insult.

50|$|As a matricellular protein, periostin is also {{important}} for tissue regeneration. In healthy human skin, periostin is expressed at basal levels and is expressed in the epidermis and hair follicles along with fibronectin and laminin γ2. Periostin is involved in wound healing, helping for the wound to heal faster than when periostin is not present in cells. This delay in wound closure is also associated with a delay in re-epithelialization {{and a reduction in}} the proliferation of keratinocytes. Periostin localizes to the extracellular compartment of cells during tissue remodeling associated with wound repair. It may also promote injury closure by facilitating the activation, differentiation, and contraction of fibroblasts. However, the increase in periostin expression associated with tissue regeneration <b>post-injury</b> is transient, starting a few days <b>post-injury,</b> peaking after seven days <b>post-injury,</b> and decreasing afterwards.|$|E

50|$|Disconnection via lesions of the {{inhibitory}} efferent pathways from cortical and subcortical {{areas of}} the brain is a potential theory. This theory deals with inhibitory pathways being ablated or malfunctioning <b>post-injury.</b> This leads to sympathetic pathways from the cortical and subcortical areas being less controlled, resulting in a 'sympathetic storm'.|$|E
50|$|Tendon, as {{a tissue}} is mechanoresponsive. Various {{academic}} {{studies show that}} tendons can respond well to controlled loading, <b>post-injury.</b> Loading of a tendon results in up regulation of insulin-like growth factor, {{in addition to other}} cytokines and growth factors.

Episodes can last {{as little as a}} few minutes or as long as ten hours, and they can occur multiple times a day. Episode duration has been seen to average 30.8 minutes and occur five to six times a day. Episodes can occur naturally or arise from external triggers. Common triggers include pain or stimulation, body turning or movements, and bladder distention. Bladder distention has been observed in patients being treated in intensive care units with the concurrent use of catheters. Symptoms of PSH can last from weeks to years following initial onset. As episodes persist over time, they have been found to become less frequent in occurrence but last for prolonged periods.|$|E
