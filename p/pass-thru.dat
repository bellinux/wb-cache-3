5000|$|Sometimes called [...] "Greasy spoons", inside, diners {{consist of}} a lunch counter and booths in the dining area, and a cooking area behind a <b>pass-thru</b> window {{to the rear of}} the lunch counter. Service is {{provided}} by waitresses, the food being prepared and forwarded to the waitresses via the <b>pass-thru</b> window. Diners generally offer 24-hour breakfast and operating hours with a wide range of foods, including homemade meatloaf, open faced sandwiches, gravy and french fries, chicken, with pastries and pies for dessert. They offer a casual atmosphere, with counter take-out service.|$|E

5000|$|An {{alternative}} financing solution where {{a supplier}} finances their receivables via a process {{started by the}} ordering party, {{in order to help}} their suppliers receive more favorable financial terms than they would have otherwise received for operational and other <b>pass-thru</b> costs incurred in providing services to the ordering party.|$|E
50|$|Many commuters {{pass through}} the city {{on their way to}} {{downtown}} Orlando. These commuters come from outlying suburban areas such as Oviedo, Winter Springs, Maitland, Altamonte Springs, Longwood and Casselberry. Winter Park's municipal government has sought to reduce speeding and aggressive driving in its downtown core and residential areas by lowering speed limits to 20 mph in some areas, adding textured traffic-calming brick roads, and aggressively enforcing the law. These measures have added traffic congestion, but preserve {{the quality of life for}} residents and encourage <b>pass-thru</b> commuters to seek alternate, high-speed routes to downtown (such as SR436/Semoran Blvd, Lake Howell Road, US17-92/Orlando Ave, Interstate 4, and the 408/East West Expressway and 417/Greeneway toll roads).|$|E
50|$|Denny Hamlin {{took the}} pole {{and led the}} first 22 laps. After being passed by Kurt Busch, Hamlin fell back to mid-field. Busch led most of the laps until lap 81, when he came down pit road for a loose wheel and was given a <b>pass-thru</b> penalty for {{speeding}}. Carl Edwards and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. shared the lead {{during the next two}} stints, before Clint Bowyer passed Earnhardt for the lead on lap 126. Bowyer led until getting spun on lap 176, causing the fourth caution. Edwards retook the lead, showing the way until being passed by Matt Kenseth on lap 236. After a lap 259 debris caution, Kenseth was caught speeding on pit road and relegated to the back, while Paul Menard stayed out to take the lead. Edwards once again claimed the lead on lap 322.|$|E
50|$|This {{simplicity}} depends, however, on {{the absence}} of deductions of any kind being allowed (or at least no variability in the deductions of different people). Furthermore, if income of differing types are segregated (e.g., <b>pass-thru,</b> long term cap gains, regular income, etc.) then complications ensue. For example, if realized capital gains were subject to the flat tax, the law would require brokers and mutual funds to calculate the realized capital gain on all sales and redemption. If there were a gain, a tax equal to 15% {{of the amount of}} the gain would be withheld and sent to the IRS. If there were a loss, the amount would be reported to the IRS. The loss would offset gains, and the IRS would settle up with taxpayers {{at the end of the}} period. Lacking deductions, this scheme cannot be used to implement economic and social policy indirectly by tax credits and thus, as noted above, the simplifications to the government's revenue collection apparatus might be offset by new government ministries required to administer those policies.|$|E
50|$|Amiga computers, due {{to their}} special design {{attention}} to graphics performance, created in the 1980s a vast market of framebuffer based graphics cards. Noteworthy to mention was the graphics card in Amiga A2500 Unix, which was in 1991 the first computer to implement an X11 server program as a server for hosting graphical environments and the Open Look GUI graphical interface in high resolution (1024x1024 or 1024x768 at 256 colors). The graphics card for A2500 Unix was called the A2410 (Lowell TIGA Graphics Card) and was an 8-bit graphics board based on the Texas Instruments TMS34010 clocked at 50 MHz. It was a complete intelligent graphics coprocessor. The A2410 graphics card for Amiga was co-developed with Lowell University. Other noteworthy Amiga framebuffer based cards were: the Impact Vision IV24 graphics card from GVP, an interesting integrated video suite, capable of mixing 24-bit framebuffer, with Genlock, Chromakey, TV signal <b>pass-thru</b> and TV in a window capabilities; the DCTV an external graphics adapter and video capture system; the Firecracker 32-bit graphics card; the Harlequin card, the Colorburst; the HAM-E external framebuffer. The Graffiti external graphics card is still available on the market.|$|E
5000|$|Some sockets are {{designed}} {{to have the same}} outside diameter and shape within a given set size. Each pass-through socket, within a given socket set, is designed to be used with a [...] "special" [...] ratchet that fits {{on the outside of the}} socket and not to the middle of the socket. By fitting the outside of the socket they allow the bolt or stud to extend through the socket, eliminating the need for a deep socket in some applications. By attaching to the outside of the socket they also allow the socket to be built up to 50% shorter and with 20% less width which is an advantage in some situations. Pass-through sockets and ratchets are built for 1/4", 3/8" [...] and 1/2" [...] sets in both SAE and metric sizes. By using a fine tooth ratchet and socket system that allow a pass-through ratchet to be used as a conventional ratchet handle with interchangeable 1/4-inch and 3/8-inch drives some ratchets can be used with standard sockets. They are built by a number of manufacturers with a variety of trade names. Craftsman Tools call theirs--Max Axess, and also sells GearWrench's <b>Pass-Thru</b> brands. Lowes calls their socket system Xtreme Access, etc.. Ratcheting box end wrenches can often be employed in the same application but will nearly always be significantly wider.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 38 - 40) This project {{illustrates a}} method of implementing a digitally equalized loudspeaker. A two-way loudspeaker using off-the-shelf transducers will be designed using the best construction methods derived from the literature. This technique will allow the author the optimum frequency response using the available components. The Harman Audio Test System (HATS) {{will be used to}} obtain acoustic measurements in a 4 pi anechoic chamber. These measurements and their processed results using HATS will characterize the acoustic performance of the un-equalized loudspeaker. HATS will then be used to determine the target functions needed to equalize the loudspeaker for flat onaxis frequency response. Vectors of the target functions will be exported to MA TLAB where they are used to generate the coefficients of two 128 -point FIR filters. The filter coefficients will then be implemented into a DSP evaluation board. An IIR implementation using values derived from HATS will be created with tools built into the DSP software. A listening comparison can then be performed using FIR or IIR equalization versus no DSP, or <b>pass-thru,</b> for subjective evaluation. Anechoic measurements will be used to verify the loudspeaker has an improved frequency response based upon the current psychoacoustic literature. Finally, further applications and existing products with similar technologies will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|My aim in {{this article}} is to provide a first pass at {{thinking}} the social effects of this credit expansion which I do via credit as a form of public security. In {{the first part of this}} article, I chart the expansion of personal credit as a form of financial corporativism during PT governments in Brazil since 2003. As well, I trace some of the principle cultural mediations of credit and the role of Rio de Janeiro as the site of the production of these mediations, in particular the form of financial mestizagem elaborated in the 2012 novela Cheias de Charme. In the second part, I turn my attention to the kind of subjects that credit expansion has produced. Here I argue that credit expansion has produced a form of the subject as a <b>pass-thru</b> where the state is less concerned with subjects’ interiority and more with facilitating the seizure of assets. This seizure requires a concomitant expansion of militarization and the threat of state violence which further hollows out the subject. I conclude by returning to Rio de Janeiro to apply these insights to the post-UPP political environment. My overall argument is that credit has functioned as a form of public security in two ways: first, state-linked discourse and cultural productions concerning credit-based consumption have produced new figures of national belonging, while, second, the legal environment required for credit expansion produces subjects increasingly exposed to the threat of state violenc...|$|E
40|$|The Z- 2 Prototype Planetary Extravehicular Space Suit Assembly is a {{continuation}} of NASA's Z series of spacesuits. The Z- 2 is another step in NASA's technology development roadmap leading to human exploration of the Martian surface. The suit was designed for maximum mobility at 8. 3 psid, reduced mass, and to have high fidelity life support interfaces. As Z- 2 will be man-tested at full vacuum in NASA JSC's Chamber B, it was manufactured as Class II, making it the most flight-like planetary walking suit produced to date. The Z- 2 suit architecture is an evolution of previous EVA suits, namely the ISS EMU, Mark III, Rear Entry I-Suit and Z- 1 spacesuits. The suit is a hybrid hard and soft multi-bearing, rear entry spacesuit. The hard upper torso (HUT) is an all-composite structure and includes a 2 -bearing rolling convolute shoulder with Vernier sizing mechanism, removable suit port interface plate (SIP), elliptical hemispherical helmet and self-don/doff shoulder harness. The hatch is a hybrid aluminum and composite construction with Apollo style gas connectors, custom water <b>pass-thru,</b> removable hatch cage and interfaces to primary and auxiliary life support feed water bags. The suit includes Z- 1 style lower arms with cam brackets for Vernier sizing and government furnished equipment (GFE) Phase VI gloves. The lower torso includes a telescopic waist sizing system, waist bearing, rolling convolute waist joint, hard brief, 2 bearing soft hip thigh, Z- 1 style legs with ISS EMU style cam brackets for sizing, and conformal walking boots with ankle bearings. The Z- 2 Requirements Verification Plan includes the verification of more than 200 individual requirements. The verification methods include test, analysis, inspection, demonstration or a combination of methods. Examples of unmanned requirements include suit leakage, proof pressure testing, operational life, mass, isometric man-loads, sizing adjustment ranges, internal and external interfaces such as in-suit drink bag, partial pressure relief valve, purge valve, donning stand and ISS Body Restraint Tether (BRT). Examples of manned requirements include verification of anthropometric range, suit self-don/doff, secondary suit exit method, donning stand self-ingress/egress and manned mobility covering eight functional tasks. The eight functional tasks include kneeling with object pick-up, standing toe touch, cross-body reach, walking, reach to the SIP and helmet visor. This paper will provide an overview of the Z- 2 design. Z- 2 requirements verification testing was performed with NASA at the ILC Houston test facility. This paper will also discuss pre-delivery manned and unmanned test results as well as analysis performed in support of requirements verification...|$|E
