40|$|An {{examination}} of {{the sensitivity of the}} effective albedo of an optically thin scattering layer for day-long solar irradiation at equinox to (1) the anisotropy parameter, which is controlled {{by the size of the}} scatterers, (2) the exclusion of the sun-near-horizon irradiation, and (3) the assumption of a spherical vs an irregular shape of the scatterers, is discussed. The albedo is analyzed assuming that for a specified phase function, which is split into a <b>point-symmetrical</b> component and an asymmetrical remainder, the albedo is proportional to the vertical optical thickness. It is shown that if the optical thickness and the phase function are not accurately known, lidar measurements of a thin dust layer can provide useful information for the climatic effect of the scatterers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present Fabry-Pérot high {{resolution}} spectroscopy in Hα, Hβ,[Oiii], and [N ii], optical low resolution spectroscopy spanning the usable range 4700 – 6800 ˚A, {{along with a}} broad band direct image in Gunn-red for the planetary nebula (PN) K 3 - 82. K 3 - 82 {{turned out to be}} highly symmetrical, seen most probably edge-on. Two <b>point-symmetrical</b> knots appear in the light of Gunn-red. These knots either represent concentrated emission regions or are part of an incomplete equatorial waist of K 3 - 82. Our results for the systemic velocity is – 62. 4 ± 5 km/s and for the average expansion velocity 30 ± 5 km/s. For the distance we determined a minimum value of 2. 5 kpc. The [S ii] ion indicates a very low density within the knots of K 3 - 82. Key words: planetary nebulae: individual: K 3 - 8...|$|E
40|$|We {{design the}} optical unit for an imaging {{time-of-flight}} scanner camera based on partially steerable micro mirrors. This {{new class of}} 3 D cameras enables video frame rates and-in conjunction with the accompanying user software-online real-time selection of regions of interest. The challenges for the optical design comprise (i) sufficient light collection from close-up objects, (ii) maximizing optical efficiency for objects at large distances, (iii) reduction of the dynamical range of signal returns and (iv) minimization of parasitic scattering. We present a solution based on coaxial beam guidance, where the emitted beam first passes a beam splitter, is then deflected by a dedicated emission mirror {{in the center of}} a <b>point-symmetrical,</b> synchronized arrangement of five micro mirrors and final ly passes a protective spherical glass cover. The mirror assembly is slightly displaced from the center of the dome in order to establish a secondary focus for parasitic reflections at the inside of the cover. The light scattered at the target surface which reaches the mirror array is directed towards an assembly of rhomboid prisms. These prisms reshape the distributed mirror array aperture such that a small lens with high numerical aperture suffices to focus the light onto a fast, small-area avalanche photo diode, thus maximizing the acceptance angle of the detector and permissible misalignments of the element mirrors...|$|E
40|$|Humans {{can readily}} and {{effortlessly}} perceive a rich, stable, and unified visual world from a complex visual scene. Yet our internal {{representation of a}} visual object appears to be sparse and fragmented. How and where in the brain are such fragmented representations organized into a whole percept? Recent studies have accumulated evidence that some global feature integration is mediated at the early stage of visual processing. However, the spatial operating range of the integration still remains unclear. The present human {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} study provides support that the global integration process in early visual areas, including even the primary visual area V 1, is mediated beyond the separated projection of visual hemifields from right and left sides of the fixation to the visual cortex of the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. Retinotopic neural responses corresponding to a visual target were significantly enhanced when another target was simultaneously presented at the <b>point-symmetrical</b> position in the nonassociated visual field quadrant. The result makes a convincing case that the contextual effects involve feedback from higher areas, because there are no direct callosal connections that allow such interhemispheric contextual modulation. This enhancement from the ipsilateral hemifield may help rapid position-and-size-invariant detection of a circular pattern, which may be special among visual structures because of its ubiquity in natural scenes. Early visual areas as well as higher ones may play a more essential role in perceiving the unity of the real world than previously thought...|$|E
40|$|In view of {{both the}} size of its gap and the {{previously}} reported asymmetries and near-infrared spiral arms, the transition disk of the Herbig Fe star HD 142527 constitutes a remarkable case study. This paper focuses on the morphology of the outer disk through ALMA observations of ^ 12 CO J= 2 - 1, ^ 12 CO J= 3 - 2 and ^ 13 CO J= 2 - 1. Both ^ 12 CO J= 2 - 1 and ^ 12 CO J= 3 - 2 show spiral features of different sizes. The innermost spiral arm (S 1) is a radio counterpart of the first near-infrared spiral observed by Fukagawa et al. (2006), but it is shifted radially outward. However, the most conspicuous CO spiral arm (S 2) lies at the outskirts of the disk and had not been detected before. It corresponds to a cold density structure, with both brightness and excitation temperatures of order 13 ± 2 K and conspicuous in the ^ 12 CO J= 2 - 1 peak-intensity map, but faint in ^ 12 CO J= 3 - 2. There is also a faint counterarm (S 3), <b>point-symmetrical</b> of S 2 with respect to the star. These three spirals are modelled separately with two different formulae that approximate the loci of density maxima in acoustic waves due to embedded planets. S 1 could be fit relatively well with these formulae, compared to S 2 and S 3. Alternative scenarios such as gravitational instability or external tidal interaction are discussed. The impact of channelization on spectrally and spatially resolved peak intensity maps is also briefly addressed. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table. Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters.

40|$|International audienceAims. The {{physical}} {{properties of the}} massive disk candidate in the star-forming region M 17 are analyzed. Methods. Making use of the rare configuration in which the gas and dust structure is seen in silhouette against the background radiation at ? = 2. 2 ?m, we determine the column density distribution from a high-resolution NAOS/CONICA image. The influence of scattered light on the mass determination is analyzed using 3 D radiative transfer calculations. Further upper flux limits derived from observations with the Spitzer telescope at MIR wavelengths are used together with the NACO image to estimate the flux from the central object. For a range of stellar radii, stellar surface temperatures, and dust grain sizes, we apply three different models {{to account for the}} observed fluxes. The stability of the disk against self-gravitational forces is analyzed calculating the ratio of the gravitational acceleration by the central object and the disk, and the deviations from a Keplerian profile. Results. We find that the column density is consistent with a central source surrounded by a rotationally symmetric distribution of gas and dust. The extent of the symmetric disk part is about 3000 AU, with a warped <b>point-symmetrical</b> extension beyond that radius, and therefore larger than any circumstellar disk yet detected. The modeling yields a radial density powerlaw exponent of ? 1. 1 indicating a flat radial density distribution, and a large e-folding scale height ratio H/R of about 0. 5. The mass of the entire disk estimated from the column density is discussed depending on the assumed distance and the dust model and ranges between 0. 02 and 5 M. We conclude that unless a star is located close to the disk in the foreground, scattered light will have little influence on the mass determination. We present a Spitzer image taken at ? = 7. 8 ?m with the disk seen in emission and identify polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission on the disk surface excited by the nearby massive stars as a possible source. Our 3 D radiative transfer calculations for the scattered light image of the central source through an edge-on disk indicate that the elliptical shape seen in the NACO image does not require the assumption of a binary system and that it is consistent with a single object. We derive stellar main sequence masses of several M, 50 M, or 10 M, depending on our assumptions that the extinction of the stellar flux is dominated (i) by the outer disk, (ii) by an inner disk comparable to the disks around intermediate-mass stars, or (iii) by an inner disk with dominating hot dust emission. We find that even for a star-disk mass ratio of 1, only the outer parts of the circumstellar disk may be influenced by self-gravity effects due to the large e-folding scale height ratio...|$|E
