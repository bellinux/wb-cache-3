5000|$|Like most Insular Celtic languages, Manx uses verb-subject-object word order: the inflected verb of a {{sentence}} <b>precedes</b> <b>the</b> subject, which itself <b>precedes</b> <b>the</b> direct object. However, as noted above, most finite verbs are formed periphrastically, using an auxiliary verb {{in conjunction with the}} verbal noun. In this case, only <b>the</b> auxiliary verb <b>precedes</b> <b>the</b> subject, while the verbal noun comes after the subject. The auxiliary verb may be a modal verb rather than a form of [...] ("be") or [...] ("do"). Particles like the negative [...] ("not") <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> inflected verb. Examples: ...|$|R
