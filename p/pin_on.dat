5|$|In {{the second}} {{semifinal}} match, Sabin and Shocker defeated Dutt and Killings at 7 minutes and 49 seconds. During the contest, Sabin accidentally hit his teammate Shocker in the face. This {{led to some}} confusion in the match, allowing Killings to get a near-fall on Sabin. This was later resolved, with Sabin getting the <b>pin</b> <b>on</b> Dutt via la magistral.|$|E
5|$|Registration of Business: Business {{registration}} {{is linked to}} a Lebanese Identity Card holder's Personal Identification Numbers (PIN) to help identify them as the true owner of their business. The Registrar General’s Department make it a requirement for all business owners to provide their <b>PIN</b> <b>on</b> the Lebanese Identity Card during business registration. This eliminates business registration fraud through the exposure of false identities and prevents multiple registrations of businesses for fraudulent purposes.|$|E
5|$|The TNA Women's Knockout Championship was {{defended by}} Taylor Wilde against Awesome Kong next in a bout that lasted 4 minutes and 51 seconds.

25|$|Some rotor {{machines}} were designed {{with a different}} number of <b>pins</b> <b>on</b> each rotor, {{with the number of}} <b>pins</b> <b>on</b> any one rotor either prime, or coprime to the number of <b>pins</b> <b>on</b> any other rotor.

5|$|Another {{hardware}} quirk produced one of {{the most}} distinctive aspects of the ZX81's screen display – during loading or saving, moving zigzag stripes appear across the screen. The same <b>pin</b> <b>on</b> the ULA is used to handle the video signal and the tape output, producing the stripes as an interference pattern of sorts. The ULA cannot maintain the display during SAVE and LOAD operations, as it has to operate continuously to maintain the correct baud rate for data transfers. The interference produces the zigzag stripes.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion, Sting, and the challenger, A.J. Styles. During the 15 minutes the match lasted, Styles {{executed}} his aerial technique the Spiral Tap, in which he jumps {{off one of the}} top padded turnbuckles, spins and flips in mid-air before landing on his opponent. He then ascended the turnbuckle to perform the maneuver once again, but was distracted by Angle and Booker T. Later, Styles missed a pele kick on Sting, which allowed Sting to counter with a small package <b>pin</b> <b>on</b> Styles to retain the championship.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase defended the World Tag Team Championship against Cryme Tyme (Shad Gaspard and JTG). The match began with Cryme Tyme in control, and Shad threw JTG {{over the top}} rope onto Rhodes and DiBiase. Rhodes and DiBiase, however, {{isolated}} JTG in their corner and performed a number of offensive maneuvers on him. Rhodes attempted a moonsault onto JTG, but missed, allowing JTG to tag in Shad {{at the same time}} Rhodes tagged in DiBiase. Shad performed a back body drop on DiBiase, but while the referee was distracted, Rhodes performed a DDT on Shad. DiBiase attempted to cover Shad, but was forced to break the cover as Shad placed his foot on the bottom rope. JTG attempted an inside cradle <b>pin</b> <b>on</b> Rhodes, but Shad accidentally pushed DiBiase on Rhodes, reversing the pinfall attempt so that Rhodes scored the pin over JTG, retaining his and DiBiase's title in the process.|$|E
5|$|McIntyre {{then began}} wrestling as a singles wrestler, {{immediately}} feuding with The Fabulous Moolah, unsuccessfully challenging her at Wrestlemania 2 (the referee counted the <b>pin</b> <b>on</b> McIntyre despite her left leg being {{draped over the}} bottom rope which should have stopped the count). She won the WWF Women's Championship on July 3, 1986 when she defeated Moolah at the Brisbane Festival Hall on the WWF's 1986 Australian tour, but Moolah regained the title six days later at the Sydney Entertainment Centre (the only two times the WWF Women's Championship changed hands in the Southern Hemisphere). Years later, Moolah called McIntyre the best female wrestler in Canada. In 1987, McIntyre consistently lost matches to Moolah and Sherri Martel. She also competed at the Survivor Series, teaming with Moolah, Rockin' Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels against Martel, Leilani Kai, Judy Martin, Donna Christanello, and Dawn Marie. By 1990, however, the women's division in the WWF was again on hiatus.|$|E

The family watches from the stand and sees Ned Flanders and his family, who claims to enjoy the high levels of safety the drivers use. Later, a squad of cheerleaders fires free T-shirts from air cannons into the crowd, and Homer rudely demands one. Irritated, Maude leaves to buy hot dogs. The cheerleaders send a full salvo of T-shirts in Homer's direction, but he bends down at the last second to pick up a bobby <b>pin</b> <b>on</b> the ground. Maude returns at that exact moment, gets hit by the T-shirts and falls {{over the edge of the}} bleachers to her death on the parking lot.|$|E

5|$|The {{predominant}} feud on the SmackDown! brand {{heading into}} the pay-per-view was between Edge and Batista, with the two battling over the World Heavyweight Championship. The two fought each other at Judgment Day for the title, and Edge won the bout with a school boy <b>pin.</b> <b>On</b> the May 25 episode of SmackDown!, General Manager Theodore Long announced that Edge would defend the World Heavyweight Championship in a Steel Cage match at One Night Stand. Batista won a Fatal Four-Way match against Finlay, Kane, and Mark Henry to earn the spot of the challenger at the pay-per-view. Batista was a guest on Edge's talk show The Cutting Edge on the June 1 episode of SmackDown!. Towards {{the end of the}} segment, Batista punched Edge and sent him to the floor. The following night, on Saturday Night's Main Event, Batista and Chris Benoit defeated Edge and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in a tag team match. During the match, Edge walked out, leaving MVP on his own against Batista and Benoit. Benoit gained the pinfall after performing a flying headbutt on MVP.|$|E
5|$|The Grenade, Hand, Anti-Tank No. 74, {{commonly}} known as the S.T. Grenade or sticky bomb, was a British hand grenade designed and produced during the Second World War. The grenade was {{one of a number of}} anti-tank weapons developed for use by the British Army and Home Guard as an ad hoc solution to a lack of sufficient anti-tank guns in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation. Designed by a team from MIR(c) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae, the grenade consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives (this added stability to the mix, as well as giving it its squash-head-like effect) covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet-metal casing. When the user pulled a <b>pin</b> <b>on</b> the handle of the grenade, the casing would fall away and expose the sticky sphere. Pulling another pin would arm the firing mechanism and the user would then attempt to attach the grenade to an enemy tank or other vehicle. Letting go of the handle would release a lever that would activate a five-second fuse, which would then detonate the nitroglycerin.|$|E
