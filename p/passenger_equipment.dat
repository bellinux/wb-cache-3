5|$|By the 1960s, the Santa Fe {{encountered}} capacity {{problems on}} the San Francisco Chief, which ran between Chicago and San Francisco. Unlike the El Capitan, the Chief carried a mix of sleeping cars and coaches. To augment capacity, the Santa Fe ordered an additional 24 coaches in 19631964; 12 step-down and 12 standard. This was the final major order for new long-distance <b>passenger</b> <b>equipment</b> before the coming of Amtrak. Each San Francisco Chief carried four Hi-Level coaches, displacing six single-level coaches.|$|E
5|$|Equipped {{with special}} Allied Full Cushion {{high-speed}} swing-motion trucks, Pullman troop sleepers {{were designed to}} be fully interchangeable with all other <b>passenger</b> <b>equipment.</b> The units came equipped with end doors {{similar to those found}} on standard railway cars, but had no vestibules. Loading and unloading of passengers was accomplished via wide doors positioned on each side {{at the center of the}} cars with built-in trap doors and steps. Light and ventilation was provided by ten window units mounted on each side, each equipped with rolling black out shades and wire mesh screens.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{traffic was}} {{important enough to}} the Monon that the railroad used the schools' colors on its rolling stock. The red and white of Wabash College (and similar to the colors of Indiana University) was used on the railroad's <b>passenger</b> <b>equipment,</b> and the black and gold used by both DePauw University and Purdue University adorned the railroad's diesel freight locomotives and later replaced the red and white on <b>passenger</b> <b>equipment</b> as well.|$|E

25|$|Prior to Amtrak's {{creation}} in 1970, intercity passenger rail {{service in the}} U.S. {{was provided by the}} same companies that provided freight service. When Amtrak was formed, in return for government permission to exit the passenger rail business, freight railroads donated <b>passenger</b> <b>equipment</b> to Amtrak and helped it get started with a capital infusion of some $200 million.|$|E
25|$|Several {{construction}} details characterized <b>passenger</b> <b>equipment.</b> Passenger trains {{were expected}} to run at higher speeds than freight service, and therefore passenger trucks evolved to allow superior ride and better tracking at those speeds. Over time, in most cases provision was made for passengers and train staff to move from car to car; therefore platforms and later vestibules were used to bridge the gap.|$|E
25|$|The Pullman Company {{operated}} several {{facilities in}} other areas of the U.S. One of these were the Pullman Shops in Richmond, California which was linked to the mainline tracks of both the Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe, servicing their <b>passenger</b> <b>equipment</b> from throughout the Western U.S. The main building of the Richmond Pullman Shops still exists, as does the thoroughfare it's located on: Pullman Avenue.|$|E

25|$|Most of Amtrak's {{intercity}} {{passenger trains}} operating to points west of Chicago use Superliners, as do select trains east of Chicago, like the Capitol Limited and Auto Train. In addition, Alaska Railroad operates passenger trains {{with a mix}} of traditional <b>passenger</b> <b>equipment</b> and large fleets of Colorado Railcar Ultra Domes (sometimes as many as 15 in one train) owned by several major cruise ship lines.|$|E
25|$|A North–South Rail Link {{has been}} {{proposed}} to unify {{the two halves of}} the rail system, to make passenger transfers much easier and faster. However, as of May 2006, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has withdrawn its sponsorship of the proposal due to its high cost. The North–South Rail Link is not mentioned in the MBTA's FY2010–FY2014 Capital Investment Program. Currently, <b>passenger</b> <b>equipment</b> is transferred between the two halves of the system via the Grand Junction Railroad, which is not used in revenue passenger service.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the deep budget cuts made to Via Rail on January 15, 1990, the Super Continental service was abolished and the Canadian was moved from the CPR route to the Super Continental's CN route. This maintained transcontinental service and allowed Via to operate its government-mandated service to small communities along the line. The new longer route bypassed Regina and Calgary in favour of Saskatoon and Edmonton. Service was reduced to three days per week and two times a week in off season, from previous daily service on both CP and CN routes. In 2007 the schedule was lengthened so that the train now takes four nights, rather than three, to travel between Toronto and Vancouver. The present schedule is almost identical with that of the 1940s over the same route, when CN operated it with steam locomotives. Today, Via Rail continues to operate the Canadian using the CN route with rebuilt ex-CPR Budd <b>passenger</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E

[...] ACF built the first all-steel passenger car in the world for Interborough Rapid Transit in 1904, and then built the first steel cars used on the London Underground in the following year. [...] The company continued to manufacture <b>passenger</b> <b>equipment</b> until 1959. [...] ACF still manufactures freight cars today.|$|E
2500|$|The Milwaukee Road aggressively marketed {{passenger}} service {{through much}} of its history, maintaining a high quality of service {{until the end of}} private intercity passenger operations in 1971. The Milwaukee prided itself on its passenger operations, providing the nation with some of its most innovative and colorful trains. The railroad's home-built equipment was among some of the best <b>passenger</b> <b>equipment</b> ever run on any American railroad. The Milwaukee's reputation for high quality service was the principal reason that UP shifted its service to the Milwaukee Road for its [...] "City" [...] streamliners in 1955.|$|E
2500|$|Through {{the second}} half of the 19th century, most RPO cars were painted in a {{somewhat}} uniform color scheme regardless of the railroad that owned or operated them. [...] Most were painted white with trim in either buff, red or blue, which made the cars stand out from the other cars. [...] By the 1890s, this practice had waned as railroads painted their RPO cars to match the rest of their <b>passenger</b> <b>equipment.</b> [...] One RPO car that was displayed at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago is one of the last known examples of the early white color scheme.|$|E

2500|$|When the G began {{service in}} 1910 the {{railroad}} owned {{a total of}} 8 steam locomotives, 16 passenger cars, 250 freight cars, a rotary snowplow, and other miscellaneous pieces of equipment; except {{for some of the}} freight cars, all equipment was acquired second-hand. [...] When service began that May, the G scheduled a tri-weekly passenger train between Armstead and Salmon, leaving Armstead on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and returning on the following days. [...] Freight trains also operated on most days. [...] Traffic levels proved lower than expected, however, and in 1913 the separate freight and passenger services were replaced by a tri-weekly mixed train, carrying both freight and <b>passenger</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In January 1941 EMD {{delivered}} the first FT unit to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, numbered Unit 100, and through that year {{they were in}} full-stride production of road and switch locomotives. [...] World War II temporarily slowed EMD's locomotive production; [...] Navy ships gained priority for Diesel power and the petroleum crisis of 1942-43 made coal-fired steam a more attractive option. [...] The War Production Board stopped production of new <b>passenger</b> <b>equipment</b> between September 1942 and December 1944. [...] By 1944, Diesel locomotive production for freight service was regaining momentum as more locomotives were needed to haul wartime supplies. [...] By the time the FT model was replaced in 1945, 555 cab units and 541 booster units were produced.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{significant}} {{component of the}} <b>passenger</b> <b>equipment</b> modernization program was the purchase of two articulated streamlined trainsets. [...] The trainsets consisted of four cars semi-permanently attached. The two end units included operating cabs and smoking and non-smoking coach seating. An additional car provided more coach seating, and the tavern/lounge car rounded out the four-car consist. [...] These trains were dubbed Electroliners and were the railroad's premiere service run as fast as 90mph between Dempster Street and North Chicago Junction on the North Shore's excellent track and roadbed. Entering service on February 9, 1941, each trainset was scheduled to run five one-way trips in Chicago-Milwaukee service every day. [...] The Electroliners continued in service {{until the end of}} the railroad in 1963. The Electoliners were sold to the Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company, and were renamed Liberty Liners. The Liberty Liners were retired around 1979.|$|E
