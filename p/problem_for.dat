5|$|Because the {{aviation}} industry is especially {{sensitive to the}} weather, accurate weather forecasting is essential. Fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off. Turbulence and icing are also significant in-flight hazards. Thunderstorms are a <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> all aircraft because of severe turbulence due to their updrafts and outflow boundaries, icing due to the heavy precipitation, as well as large hail, strong winds, and lightning, {{all of which can}} cause severe damage to an aircraft in flight. Volcanic ash is also a significant <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> aviation, as aircraft can lose engine power within ash clouds. On a day-to-day basis airliners are routed {{to take advantage of the}} jet stream tailwind to improve fuel efficiency. Aircrews are briefed prior to takeoff on the conditions to expect en route and at their destination. Additionally, airports often change which runway is being used to take advantage of a headwind. This reduces the distance required for takeoff, and eliminates potential crosswinds.|$|E
