5|$|However, Gandhi had sound {{reasons for}} his decision. The salt tax was a deeply {{symbolic}} choice, since salt was used by nearly everyone in India, to replace the salt lost by sweating in India's tropical climate.

5|$|After {{the events}} of Bloody Sunday in January 1905 sparked a {{revolution}} in Russia, Tsar Nicholas II was forced to make concessions. In April 1905 a decree guaranteed complete freedom of religion, and even allowed religious studies to be conducted in native languages. The most important decree, the October Manifesto, was announced on October 30 (October 17 O.S.), 1905. It guaranteed many <b>political</b> <b>rights,</b> {{including the right to}} form political parties and organize convocations. This decree formed the legal basis for the assembly in Vilnius. The October Manifesto also announced the intent to hold elections to the Russian Parliament (Duma), and the Lithuanian organizers used this as an official pretext for the Seimas: they claimed that the Lithuanians needed to prepare themselves for this election.|$|E

He set which territories would belong to Curuzu Cuatiá and Mandisoví, and organised their urban layout around the chapel and school. By November the army arrived at the coast of Paraná near Apipé island, and there Belgrano took measures to benefit the natives that were living in missions. With his authority as speaker of the Junta he gave them full civil and <b>political</b> <b>rights,</b> granted lands, authorised commerce with the United Provinces, and lifted their restriction on taking public or religious office. However, the Junta requested later that he should seek authorization for such changes in the future.|$|E

40|$|There {{seems to}} an {{unquestionable}} {{assumption that the}} religious right is {{in bed with the}} <b>political</b> <b>right.</b> In fact, the very name “religious right” is an indicator of this type of political alliance. On a range of issues, right-wing politicians have been able to mobilize this religious right: abortion, gay rights, sex before marriage, drugs, divorce, foreigners, and, more recently, Muslims. However, the religious <b>right</b> and the <b>political</b> <b>right</b> have not always been riveted together – or rather, the “religious right” has not always been “right. ” (I do not mean the small but extremely important groups such as Sojourners.)
