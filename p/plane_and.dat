5|$|Because {{of the bad}} weather, the B-17s {{returned}} individually to Mitchel Field. Cousland's Flying Fortress encountered severe hail, damaging all {{the forward}} surfaces of the <b>plane,</b> <b>and</b> ice caused a temporary shutdown of one engine.

5|$|Passing through The Bahamas on August 6–7, the {{tropical}} storm caused minor {{damage on the}} islands. Due to the rough seas, ships were taken to Nassau Harbor to ride out the storm. The storm passed without any disruption of shipping services. However, the flying boat Topsy Fish, containing two people, became lost over Bahamian waters on August8. The <b>plane</b> <b>and</b> crew were later found north of Andros Island by a Miami relief <b>plane</b> <b>and</b> a boat from Nassau three days later. Cuba, located south of the storm throughout its duration, reported minimal effects from the hurricane, other than a lowering of barometric pressures as reported by José Carlos Millás, then-chief of the Cuban National Observatory. However, occasional thunderstorm activity fueled by the hurricane dropped rainfall over the island, and the storm generated heavy seas at the Cuban coast.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(V) {{fluoride}} and protactinium(V) chloride have a polymeric {{structure of}} monoclinic symmetry. There, within one polymeric chain, all the halide atoms lie in one graphite-like <b>plane</b> <b>and</b> form planar pentagons around the protactinium ions. The coordination 7 of protactinium originates from the 5 halide atoms and two bonds to protactinium atoms {{belonging to the}} nearby chains. These compounds easily hydrolyze in water.

He began training on the Messerschmitt Bf 110, a two-seater twin-engine aircraft, in October 1940 under instructor Wilhelm Stör, the chief test pilot at Messerschmitt. He continued to practice, including logging many cross-country flights, and found a specific aircraft that handled well—a Bf 110E-1/N—which was from then on held in reserve for his personal use. He asked for a radio compass, modifications to the oxygen delivery system, and large long-range fuel tanks to be installed on this <b>plane,</b> <b>and</b> these requests were granted by March 1941.|$|E

5|$|An {{intuitive}} {{understanding of}} X-ray diffraction {{can be obtained}} from the Bragg model of diffraction. In this model, a given reflection is associated with a set of evenly spaced sheets running through the crystal, usually passing through the centers of the atoms of the crystal lattice. The orientation of a particular set of sheets is identified by its three Miller indices (h, k, l), and let their spacing be noted by d. William Lawrence Bragg proposed a model in which the incoming X-rays are scattered specularly (mirror-like) from each plane; from that assumption, X-rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine constructively (constructive interference) when the angle θ between the <b>plane</b> <b>and</b> the X-ray results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple n of the X-ray wavelength λ.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw {{to make up the difference}} in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the tip of the snout. However, the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom <b>plane,</b> <b>and</b> the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E
