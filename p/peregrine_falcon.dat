5|$|The <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> is the {{national}} animal of the United Arab Emirates. Since 1927, the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> has been the official mascot of Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio.

5|$|The <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> is host to a {{range of}} parasites and pathogens. It is a vector for Avipoxvirus, Newcastle disease virus, Falconid {{herpesvirus}} 1 (and possibly other Herpesviridae), and some mycoses and bacterial infections. Endoparasites include Plasmodium relictum (usually not causing malaria in the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon),</b> Strigeidae trematodes, Serratospiculum amaculata (nematode), and tapeworms. Known <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> ectoparasites are chewing lice, Ceratophyllus garei (a flea), and Hippoboscidae flies (Icosta nigra, Ornithoctona erythrocephala).|$|E

5|$|The <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> {{became an}} {{endangered}} species primarily due {{to the use of}} organochlorine pesticides, especially DDT, the breakdown of which lowered estrogen levels in the bloodstream of female peregrine falcons and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to grow thinner by up to 20 percent. Since peregrine falcons lay their eggs on rocky ledges rather than nests, the thinned shells break under the stress of both the rocky ledge and the weight of the parents during incubation. Following 1970, recovery efforts for the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> population have been successful. The agricultural use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1972, and recovery teams in the eastern United States were successful in breeding and training peregrines in captivity to later release to the wild, a procedure called hacking. In 1999, the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E
5|$|By 1975, {{peregrine}} falcons {{had been}} reduced to 324 pairs in North America, primarily as a result of DDT, a widely used pesticide. DDT lowered estrogen levels in female peregrines and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to thin and break during incubation. Recovery efforts for the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> have been remarkably successful: agricultural DDT was banned by the U.S. in 1972 and efforts to breed and train peregrine falcons in captivity to later release to the wild were effective. In 1999, the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E

5|$|Marcy Cottrell Houle wrote Wings for My Flight in {{the several}} decades {{following}} a major {{decline in the}} <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> population, which occurred between 1950 and 1970. During the 1930s and 1940s, an estimated 1000 breeding pairs of peregrine falcons inhabited the western United States and Mexico, coupled with 500 pairs in the eastern U.S. By the 1970s, no peregrine falcons were discovered east of the Rocky Mountains, and in the west, <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> populations had declined by 80 to 90 percent. By 1975, {{the year in which}} the events of Wings for My Flight take place, only 324 pairs of peregrine falcons were known to reside in North America, with only seven pairs in the Rocky Mountains region, and one at Chimney Rock, a prominent rock formation in southwestern Colorado.|$|E
5|$|The <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> {{is a well}} {{respected}} falconry bird due to its strong hunting ability, high trainability, versatility, {{and in recent years}} availability via captive breeding. It is effective on most game bird species from small to large.|$|E

40|$|Individual <b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcons</b> (Falco peregrinus) may be {{identified}} by visually comparing their toe-scale patterns. However, these comparisons are tedious when dealing {{with large numbers of}} birds. We developed a computerized classification system to facilitate the identification process. The classification system was based on the analysis of photographs of the dorsal surface of the third toes of both feet, and on the formulation of an alphanumeric code that distinguished right from left feet, and single from double scales of 90 <b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcons</b> (F. p. anatum). Each code was entered into a computerized filing program, and toe-scale patterns were classified by similarities, dividing them into groups. The system was tested by randomly selecting photographs on file, generating a code by established criteria and matching the code with the computerized file code. The system allowed quick differentiation of individual <b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcons</b> from a large number of catalogued <b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcons...</b>|$|R
5|$|A 2014 {{study of}} falcons of {{different}} species (gyrfalcon, saker falcon, and <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon)</b> used video cameras mounted {{on their heads}} or backs to track their approaches to prey. Comparison of the observed paths with simulations of different pursuit strategies showed that these predatory birds used a motion camouflage path consistent with CATD.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> decline, Houle studied {{biology at}} Colorado College in Colorado Springs. The institution's block {{scheduling}} system meant that Houle had fewer classes each day, {{allowing her to}} travel frequently to experience various ecosystems {{in addition to her}} academic studies. Upon leaving college, Houle began working for the Colorado Division of Wildlife, and her first field assignment was to observe <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> activity along the Rocky Mountains for four summers, two of which were spent at Chimney Rock. Following her experience with the peregrine falcons, Houle had to decide whether to continue pursuing wildlife biology or to commit instead to her passion of writing. Wings for My Flight combined both of Houle's interests; it recounted her observations of the peregrines as well as her interaction with the community at Chimney Rock during her first summer there.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus macropus, {{described}} by Swainson in 1837, is the Australian <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon.</b> It {{is found in}} Australia in all regions except the southwest. It is non-migratory. It is similar to brookei in appearance, but is slightly smaller and the ear region is entirely black. The feet are proportionally large.|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the timing of}} southward migration of <b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcons</b> (Falco peregrinus) across North America, based on passage data compiled by the Hawk Migration Association of North America, supplemented with two other similar datasets collected by individual observers at sites in western Canada. The results show two distinct continental-scale patterns. First, the north to south progression of peak peregrine passage down the continent is readily apparent, occurring primarily during September and October. Second, the movement of <b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcons</b> is earlier by 4 ¿ 6 wk {{on the west coast}} than on the eastern seaboard, and is intermediate at inland sites. The wavefront of <b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcons</b> advancing southward is oriented from southwest to northeast across the North American continent. We hypothesize that these patterns have implications for the southward migrations of potential prey species, which may select routes or times to avoid places of high risk due to <b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcons...</b>|$|R

5|$|Some falcons {{have the}} speed and agility to catch {{swallows}} and martins in flight, and pale crag martins may be hunted by species such as the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon,</b> Taita falcon, African hobby and wintering Eurasian hobby.
