The lower pull-off strength for unpatterned PDMS may be explained by the initiation of the pull-off process {{at the edge of the}} probe, where significant stress concentrates. With micro-rough surfaces, <b>pillar</b> <b>arrays</b> showed maximum adhesion with a certain intermediate roughness, while unpatterned controls did not show any measurable adhesion.

The merging part {{consists of a}} main and side channels separated by a <b>pillar</b> <b>array.</b> The <b>pillar</b> <b>array</b> structure is contained within a microfuidic channel. The function of the <b>pillar</b> <b>array</b> provides a bypass path to the continuous flow (oil) inside the merging chamber.

A three component mixture could be separated in 3 s using arrays of nonporous silicon pillars with a diameter of approximately 4. 3 μm and an external porosity of 55 %. Under slightly retained component conditions (retention factor k‘ = 0. 65 − 1. 2), plate heights of about H = 4 μm were obtained at a mobile phase velocity around u = 0. 5 mm/s. In reduced terms, such plate heights are as low as hmin = 1. Also, since the flow resistance of the column is much smaller than in a packed column (mainly because of the higher external porosity of the <b>pillar</b> <b>array),</b> the separation impedance of the array was as small as E = 150, i. e., of the same order as the best currently existing monolithic columns. At pH = 3, yielding very low retention factors (k‘ = 0. 13 and 0. 23), plate heights as low as H = 2 μm were realized, yielding a separation of the three component mixture with an efficiency of N = 4000 − 5000 plates over a column length of 1 cm. At higher retention factors, significantly larger plate heights were obtained. More experimental work is needed to investigate this more in depth.
