50|$|Demand at {{capacity}} is {{the volume of}} production for a single <b>product</b> <b>item</b> at capacity. It is a fixed value that defines the maximum daily rate of supply. The Demand-at-Capacity is often confused with the daily rate of production. In contrast to Toyota Production System, and many other lean manufacturing derivatives, a DFT line is designed for variable output rates according to daily demand. Thus, the demand data that are used for line design represent a limit quantity not an actual rate of supply. The relationship between the Dc and the average daily demand will be driven by the required service level of the <b>product</b> <b>item</b> to market demand. A higher service level will call for capacity that can supply a higher daily rate than the average over a long range. This will likely affect the resource productivity and inventory levels. A greater mix on the line is able to provide {{a higher level of}} service for any given level of resources and inventory.|$|E

5000|$|Early in the 20th century, A.1. sauce was {{a decidedly}} {{secondary}} sideline to Heublein's thriving cocktail business, with its promotions and advertising copy {{aimed at the}} carriage trade, delivering to hotels and even directly to the [...] "consumer" [...] at home. When they incorporated in the State of Connecticut on December 2, 1915, they already had offices in New York as well as Hartford. As the 1920s dawned, Heublein's business encountered a major problem, but an unexpected savior appeared from within. The US rights for A.1.

50|$|With PoP one {{important}} thing is different. The very equipment on which the OEM produces or assembles the final product, in the OEM factory, is supplied by, but still remains owned by, and is also maintained by, the equipment supplier. But {{it is still the}} OEM's personnel who assemble the products on the equipment and facilities. The external equipment supplier is then paid a fixed price for every <b>product</b> <b>item</b> which is assembled or produced on their equipment. The general idea of PoP is similar to using a rented car. The car is always owned and maintained by the car rental company but used or driven by the customer. The customer pays the car rental company for using the car, e.g. per every driven kilometre. However, in the assembly line case the contract is not just for a few days, rather both partners plan to keep the agreement {{for as long as the}} product is produced on the equipment, though it can be terminated before this. It means PoP is not therefore so much a production system, more of a financial model.|$|E
40|$|With {{advancement}} in {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID), RFID-based track-and-trace anti-counter-feiting has attracted considerable research interests. Track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting demands a trustworthy electronic pedigree (e-pedigree), which records the movements of <b>product</b> <b>items</b> from manufacturers to retailers, to ensure high supply chain visibility and to provide evidence for product authentication. Creation and synchronization of initial e-pedigrees in the manufacturing stage is particularly crucial to the accuracy and trustworthiness of subsequent processing of the e-pedigrees and authentication of <b>product</b> <b>items.</b> This is a critical yet challenging task, as it involves a number of practical issues, such as incomplete tag writing/locking, environment disturbances, and potential data falsification. This paper first presents an innovative track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting system, and then proposes a tag data processing and synchronization (TDPS) algorithm to generate initial e-pedigrees for general, tangible products during production. An RFID-enabled apparel packaging line is established to validate the performance of TDPS and identify the bottleneck of e-pedigree generation. Experiment results show that TDPS can create accurate and secure initial e-pedigrees for fast moving <b>product</b> <b>items,</b> and that tag EPC writing is a major bottleneck of e-pedigree generation. Thus, we optimise TDPS by incorporating a block writing method and an integrated verification step to remove the bottleneck. Further experiments demonstrate the optimised TDPS {{can be adapted to}} suit different practical requirements to achieve a good balance between tag writing/locking rate and the moving speed of <b>product</b> <b>items</b> in packaging lines without severing the throughput...|$|R

40|$|Managing product {{information}} for product items during their whole lifetime is challenging, especially during their usage and end-of-life phases. The main difficulty {{is to maintain}} a communication link between the <b>product</b> <b>item</b> and its associated information as the <b>product</b> <b>item</b> moves over organizational borders and between different users. As network access will typically not be continuous during the whole product-item lifecycle, {{it is necessary to}} embed at least a globally unique product identifier (GUPI) that makes it possible to identify the <b>product</b> <b>item</b> anytime during its lifecycle. A GUPI also has to provide a linking mechanism to {{product information}} that may be stored in backend systems of different organizations. GUPIs are thereby a cornerstone for enabling the Internet of Things, where ‘intelligent products’ can communicate over the Internet. In the current paper, we analyse and compare the three main currently known approaches for achieving such functionality, i. e. the EPC Network, DIALOG and WWAI...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Given a {{directed}} graph, we {{can determine}} how the user’s preference moves from one <b>product</b> <b>item</b> to another. In this graph called “preference transition network”, each node represents the <b>product</b> <b>item</b> while its edge pointing to the other nodes represents the transition of user’s preference. However, with {{the large number of}} items make the network become more complex, unclear and difficult to be interpreted. In order to address this problem, this paper proposes a visualization technique in preference transition analysis based on recency and frequency. By adapting these two elements, the semantic meaning of each item and its transition can be clearly identified by its different types of node size, color and edge style. The experiment in a sales data has shown the results of the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{structural}} model {{to study the}} effect of online product reviews on consumer purchases of experiential products. Such purchases are characterized by limited repeat purchase behavior of the same <b>product</b> <b>item</b> (such as a book title) but significant past usage experience with other products of the same type (such as books of the same genre). To cope with the uncertainty in quality of the <b>product</b> <b>item,</b> we posit that consumers may learn from their experience with {{the same type of}} product and others' experiences with the <b>product</b> <b>item.</b> We model the review credibility as the precision with which product reviews reflect the consumer's own product evaluation. The higher the precision, the more credible the information obtained from product reviews for the consumer, and the larger the effect of reviews on the consumer's choice probabilities. We extend the Bayesian learning framework to model consumer learning on both product quality and review credibility. We apply the model to a panel data set of 1, 919 book purchases by 243 consumers. We find that consumers learn more from online reviews of book titles than from their own experience with other books of the same genre. In the counterfactual analysis, we illustrate the profit impact of product reviews and how it varies with the number of reviews. We also study the phenomenon of fake reviews. We find that fake reviews increase consumer uncertainty. The effects of more positive reviews and more numerous reviews on consumer choice are smaller on online retailing platforms that have fake product reviews...|$|E

40|$|UccNet ([URL] is a {{globally}} centralized B 2 B {{electronic data}} platform for storing trading <b>product</b> <b>item</b> information and {{hosted by the}} non-profit international standardization institute EAN-UCC. It is an emerging B 2 B data communication standard for the retail industry with significant potential impact. Many US retailers are requesting their international suppliers for compulsory subscription by the year-end of either 2004 or 2005 and many major IT software providers and consulting firms specialized in supply chain management are preparing packaged services/solutions for this imminent demand. In light of the increasing importance of UccNet on both the technology and application sides, this paper attempts to advance the following argument: Though UccNet establishes an architectural framework to resolve the many-to-many connectivity issue and data synchronization issue through a centralized product database and a uniform numbering system (i. e., Global Trade Item Numbering), there are context discrepancy issues remaining to be addressed. We show with a real case study that context discrepancy {{is inherent in the}} international trading applications where UccNet is intended to be used. Naturally, international trading partners tend to define and describe <b>product</b> <b>item</b> information differently. That difference, either due to the culture or the geographical location, is not considered in the original design of UccNet. As an example, the attribute "width" contained in the database schema of UccNet would be filled by a China-based supplier in 'meter' and yet be interpreted as 'feet' by the US retail buyer. We show how the Context Interchange Framework, operating under the rationale of local autonomy and speaking to the resolution of context mediation issue, can be nicely incorporated into the existing UccNet framework to constitute theoretically a more complete technical solution and practically a more useful B 2 B supply chain business solution...|$|E
