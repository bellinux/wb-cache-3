50|$|The term <b>printed</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>in</b> United States patent law, {{refers to}} {{information}} {{associated with an}} article of manufacture that is claimed to distinguish an article from similar articles already in the prior art.

25|$|But overweening vanity {{formed a}} strong part of Cruikshank's character. He boasted {{so much of}} the {{assistance}} he had rendered authors, that at last he believed he had written their works. Had he been connected with Fielding, he would no doubt have asserted that he wrote a great portion of Tom Jones. Moreover, he was excessively troublesome and obtrusive in his suggestions. Mr. Dickens declared to me that he could not stand it, and should send him <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> future.|$|R
5000|$|John Benson {{began his}} career as a {{stationer}} in 1635; he maintained shops in Chancery Lane (from 1635 on) and St. Dunstan's Churchyard in Fleet Street (1640 and after). In his publishing career, Benson generally concentrated on the lower end of the market for <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> his era; he [...] "specialized in the publication of ballads and broadsides." [...] Yet he published books too, like Joseph Rutter's The Shepherds' Holy-Day (1635); he issued Ben Jonson's Execration Against Vulcan in 1640.|$|R

The story recounted in Il Puttino must have occurred around 1575, thus, published by Salvio some 60 years later. [...] "Il Puttino, altramente detto il Cavaliere errante" [...] is a nickname used by Alessandro Salvio for Giovanni Leonardo.

5000|$|Though in the mid-'90s {{cassette}} culture {{seemed to}} decline {{with the appearance}} of new technologies and methods of distribution such as the Internet, MP3 files, file sharing, and CD-Rs, in recent years it has once again seen a revival, with the rise of partly or wholly tape-based labels such as Burger Records, Suplex Cassettes, Memorials of Distinction, Tuff Enuff Records, First Base Tapes and Gnar Tapes.

50|$|In postal history, a {{circular}} delivery company was {{a type of}} company which operated in Great Britain between 1865 and 1869 to deliver circulars and other <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> at rates lower than the British Post Office charged. The service was outlawed in 1869 and a new cheaper postage rate for <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> introduced <b>in</b> 1870. The stamps issued by the companies are much sought after by philatelists.|$|R

We {{tried to make}} practical application of the image information processors for both education and research by the training of treatments on processing, storage, file management and communication of image information. And then, we prepared <b>printed</b> <b>matters</b> <b>in</b> order to obtain informations for exercise or education through questionnaires, using computer softwares (e. g. Japanese word processor, two-dimentional drawing). Continuously, we edited image-informed prints by means of image-scanner and communicated by means of facsimile mainly between laboratories in university and the preparation room in attached junior high school...|$|R

5000|$|In an 1856 advertisement, The Era {{claimed to}} be the [...] "largest Newspaper in the World, {{containing}} Sixty-four Columns of <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> small type. It is the only Weekly Newspaper combining all the advantages of a first-rate Sporting Journal, with those of a Family Newspaper. Literature and the Metropolitan and Provincial Drama has more space allotted to them in the Era than in any other Journal. The Operatic and Musical Intelligence, Home and Continental, is always most copious and interesting." [...] The Era became regarded as [...] "Invaluable for reviews, news, and general theatrical information and gossip. Also of value are the assorted advertisements by and for actors and companies" ...|$|R
5000|$|The legal {{analysis}} of this issue speaks in terms of [...] "printed matter" [...] that is imprinted upon a [...] "substrate." [...] For example, letters might be printed {{on a piece of}} paper as substrate, in an extreme case. Or digitized information (the <b>printed</b> <b>matter),</b> such as a jpeg file representative of the Mona Lisa, might be encoded in an EPROM memory chip as substrate. A computer program (the <b>printed</b> <b>matter)</b> might be encoded in a computer-readable medium such as a hard disk (the substrate)----and thus be the subject of a so-called Beauregard claim. The current {{legal analysis}}, as expressed in the definitive decision on <b>printed</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>In</b> re Gulack, is as follows: The differences between a newly claimed substrate bearing <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> and a prior art substrate, where the only point of departure from the prior art is <b>in</b> the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> itself, are not entitled to patentable weight unless the <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> and the substrate have a new and unobvious functional relationship. The analysis is thus essentially an obviousness analysis under section 103 of the patent law, rather than (as it was in earlier times) an analysis of statutory subject matter under what is now section 101 of the patent law.|$|R
50|$|By law, {{two copies}} of all <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> {{published}} <b>in</b> Israel must be deposited in the National Library. In 2001, the law was amended to include audio and video recordings, and other non-print media.

50|$|The {{collected}} works are organized by artist's last names, with special sections {{based on the}} type of materials (i.e., zines, audio, periodicals, specific presses). Organization can be a challenge so each year an inventory is taken of all materials at <b>Printed</b> <b>Matter,</b> resulting <b>in</b> a comprehensive listing that is very organized in July of each year.|$|R
40|$|A {{readability}} gauge {{was constructed}} which objectively gauges the readability of <b>printed</b> <b>matter.</b> <b>In</b> the past such gauges {{have been produced}} using photographically created noise. In this study a gauge was constructed using noise generated by a computer. This gauge was evaluated and compared with a gauge produced using the photographic technique of noise generation. The computer generated gauge proved {{to be as good}} as the photographic gauge at detecting differences in leg ibility of printed type. It was also found that the only two causes of variability in the legibility samples used were letter size and letter contrast. Using only size and contrast as variables it was possible to explain 92 % of the variability of the gauges...|$|R
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 1863 Tsar Alexander II issued Temporary Rules for State Junior Schools of the Northwestern Krai, ruling that only Russian-language {{education}} would be allowed there. In 1864, the Governor General of the Vilnius Governorate, Mikhail Muravyov, ordered that Lithuanian language primers were to be printed only in the Cyrillic alphabet. Muravyov's successor, Konstantin Kaufman, in 1865 banned all Lithuanian-language use of the Latin alphabet. In 1866, the Tsar issued an oral ban on the printing or importing of <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> Lithuanian. Although formally, the order had no legal force, it was executed de facto until 1904. During this time, there were approximately fifty-five printings of Lithuanian books in Cyrillic.|$|R
50|$|His {{publications}} in English include The Shakuhachi, A Manual for Learning {{originally published in}} 1988 by Ongaku no Tomo-sha, the first book on shakuhachi technique and history in the English language published by a major publishing company (later re-written and published by <b>Printed</b> <b>Matter</b> Press <b>in</b> 2008). In 2006, Ongaku no Tomo-sha published the Japanese version of this manual. <b>In</b> 2005, <b>Printed</b> <b>Matter</b> Press published his semi-autobiographic account {{of his life in}} Japan The Single Tone, A Personal Journey into Shakuhachi Music.|$|R
40|$|Using G. Mayans and Siscar’s {{collection}} of letters {{as a source}} of information an analysis is made of the printing process of one of Nicolás Antonio’s manuscripts ‘Censura de Historias Fabulosas’ [‘Censorship of Fabled Stories’]. This paper presents the different aspects of the publication of a book in the 18 th century in their sequential order from the planning of the project to the marketing of the final product. Project funding, paper and fonts supplies, forme and page design, as well as the issuing of printing licenses by the authorities and proofreading are all dealt with. Similarly, issues related to the binding, advertising, distribution and sale of <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the century of the Enlightenment are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the course}} of his quarter-century career, Pavier grew rich by {{publishing}} popular works of Puritan literature in multiple editions. At the start of his career, however, he worked {{at the lower end of}} the prestige scale <b>in</b> <b>printed</b> <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> his era: he primarily published ballads, chapbooks, pamphlets, and playbooks. One of his earliest products in the ballad line was The Fair Widow of Watling Street and Her Three Daughters (c. 1600). He followed this with many comparable works, with titles like The Lamentable Murthers of Sir John Fitz (1605), A Cruel Murther in Worcestershire (1605), The Fire in Shoreditch (1606), The Traitors' Downfall (1606), The Shepherd's Lamentation (1612), and The Burning of Tyverton (1612). He also published ballads by Thomas Deloney and Samuel Rowlands.|$|R
5000|$|The CueCat, styled :CueCat with {{a leading}} colon, is a cat-shaped {{handheld}} barcode reader that {{was released in}} 2000 by the now-defunct Digital Convergence Corporation. The CueCat enabled a user to open a link to an Internet URL by scanning a barcode — called a [...] "cue" [...] by Digital Convergence — appearing in an article or catalog or on some other <b>printed</b> <b>matter.</b> <b>In</b> this way, a user {{could be directed to}} a web page containing related information without having to enter a URL. The company asserted that the ability of the device to direct users to a specific URL, rather than a domain name, was valuable. In addition, television broadcasters could use an audio tone in programs or commercials that, if a TV was connected to a computer via an audio cable, acted as a web address shortcut.|$|R
