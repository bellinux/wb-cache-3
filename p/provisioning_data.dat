40|$|AbstractConfiguring {{automated}} {{recovery in}} a multilayer virtualized network presents significant architectural issues. The rules {{that define the}} interworking strategy between recovery mechanisms must be translated into technology-specific provisioning commands sent to network devices. This <b>provisioning</b> <b>data</b> is typically fragmented across many computing and networking resources. There is also a set of possible device actions that can be performed by a resource, such as forwarding traffic to a protection route, discovering a route to send traffic, adjusting security characteristics of a link, and matching sender and receiver characteristics. Consequently, multiple information models, {{each of which is}} specific to a device type and technology layer must be understood, aligned and shared. As a result, an approach is needed to verify and validate that the resulting recovery operations from the input <b>provisioning</b> <b>data</b> achieve end-to-end service requirements. This paper presents an ontological approach to assure the correct coordination of recovery actions using an integrated knowledge model of multilayer recovery. With an ontological approach, an assurance case that proves correctness of provisioning and resulting network operations can be automated. Such an ontological model identifies the key domain elements and their relationships. Associated statements can then be retrieved from a knowledgebase so that the constraints associated with the network representation and service requirements can be tested...|$|E

However, previous works focused on only service discovery for user queries and lack the consideration of context information such as location, time, network, computing environment, and preference for users.

Therefore, we present a framework for a service provisioning middleware system that can discover primitive services and compose dynamic complex services according to the context information. We also describe an algorithm of service composition which uses the service history information and an ontology engine with data mining. Finally, we show that our experiments enhance the possibility of provisioning services considering user’s preference and thus provide users with newly composed optimal services.

To achieve quality of {{results for the}} data assets, we need to enable DaaS elasticity by trading off quality and cost of resource usage. However, most of the cur-rent work on DaaS is focused on infrastructure elasticity, such as scaling in/out data nodes and virtual machines based on performance and usage, without considering the data assets ’ quality of results. In this paper, we introduce an elastic data asset model for <b>provisioning</b> <b>data</b> enriched with quality of results. Based on this model, we present techniques to generate and operate data elasticity management process {{that is used to}} monitor, evaluate and enforce expected quality of results. We develop a runtime system to guarantee the quality of resulting data assets provisioned on-demand. We present several experiments to demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed techniques. ...|$|E

To be environmentally friendly, it is desirable to reduce energy consumption of OLT as much as possible; such requirement becomes even more urgent as OLT keeps increasing its <b>provisioning</b> <b>data</b> rate, and higher data rate provisioning usually implies higher energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient OLT structure which guarantees services of end users with the smallest number of power-on OLT line cards. More specifically, we adapt the number of power-on OLT line cards to the real-time incoming traffic. Also, in order to avoid service disruption resulted by powering off OLT line cards, proper optical switches are equipped in OLT to dynamically configure the communications between OLT line cards and ONUs.

30|$|Industrial systems: There exist several {{tools and}} systems offered by modern cloud {{providers}} to their users that aim at providing fully automated application deployment. In the Openstack ecosystem, Heat [12] is an orchestration system which aims at managing an application throughout its lifecycle. The users submit application descriptions (named HOT, i.e., Heat Orchestration Template), where they define: The application modules, the resources each module will occupy, the dependencies between different modules (if any) {{and any other}} runtime parameter (e.g., name of the SSH key to use, flavor id, etc.). In order to maximize reusability, Heat templates can be parameterized, abstracting the installation-specific details (e.g., image/flavor IDs, key names, etc.) from the application description. Sahara [13] is a different deployment tool for Openstack that specializes in <b>provisioning</b> <b>Data</b> Processing clusters, i.e., Hadoop and Spark clusters. Sahara uses Heat as the deployment engine and differs from it as it enables the users to provide Hadoop-specific deployment parameters (e.g., HDFS replication size, number of slaves, etc.) and applies them to the cluster. The AWS counterpart of Openstack Heat is the AWS CloudFormation [15]. Similar to Heat, CloudFormation receives templates that describe what resources will be utilized and by which components. The cloud user can then define a set of parameters (keys, image ids, etc.) and launch the deployment. AWS Elastic Beanstalk [23] specializes in deploying web applications to the AWS cloud, hiding the infrastructure internals and automating the provisioning of load balancers, application-level monitoring, etc.|$|E
40|$|The {{last few}} years, {{there has been}} an {{extensive}} body of literature in data warehousing applications that primarily focuses on basket-type (transactional) data, common in retail industries. In this paper we focus on service <b>provisioning</b> <b>data,</b> that is data that is recorded internally in an organization for provisioning certain business related tasks. Coupling the recorded data with the underlying process and business-practice(s) that generate them is crucial for end-to-end analysis. Our framework is based on a graph description of the process (called a sketch) that is generating this data. Using this sketch, we formalize a new class of aggregate queries that consolidate data from a part of the process, based on a user defined path expression. We then show how to build a compact, non-redundant collection of summary (aggregate) tables and indices for this new type of queries. We first explore how to select a minimum set of views to answer queries with pathexpressions over the given sketch. For queries that also include aggregation, we define two partial orders among the views. The first is used to pick the minimum set of aggregate views to answer any query with no false dismissals, while the second describes an augmented set that allows fewer false positives. Computing a non-materialized aggregate is done through appropriate rewriting of the user query. We describe two indexing schemes that use phantom (non-materialized) aggregate values to expedite query processing. Experimental results show these schemes to perform well on synthetic and real datasets. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Business Administration)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2005. Transformation brought {{many changes}} to the South African Navy (SAN). The "old way" of provisioning, which {{involved}} spending enormous amounts of money on maintaining high stock levels and running supply processes through an overly large staff component, is over. The new Navy will have to survive with fewer funds and a reduced staff. This changed circumstance calls for a more efficient and effective provisioning process. The current provisioning process handed down from pre-transformation days is outdated and totally obsolete. The result is that Commodity Managers (CMs) {{do not have an}} adequate process for the planning, decision-making and control functions of their supply support activities. This absence of an updated, clearly defined provisioning process is causing poor end-user service delivery. This research project starts with a literature survey (Chapter 2) in which published practices are reviewed to substantiate the need for and importance of a process that includes planning, decision-making and control. This research concentrates on government and military practices and investigates processes that support operational planning and sustainability levels. It also includes the principles of logistics and articles on lessons learnt by other military organisations. The second step involves interviews with provisioning managers of similar organisations to the SAN (Chapter 3). The result of these interviews identifies new and interesting concepts that may assist in achieving a more effective provisioning system within the SAN. A statistical investigation (Chapter 4) involving <b>provisioning</b> <b>data</b> provides insight into the bottlenecks and highlights the need for a provisioning-package process-smoothing capability. Interviews with SAN members (Chapter 5) provides insight into the input interface challenges and identifies the need for a tracking system that gives a real-time indication of requirement progress. The findings of this research provides recommendations (Chapter 6) at national strategic, military strategic, operational and tactical levels regarding the planning, decision-rnaking and control functions that will lead to the establishment of a valid provisioning process for the Commodity Management subsection of the SAN. This will ensure that a standard process is followed enabling the effective provisioning of SAN end users using fewer funds and with a reduced staff...|$|E

40|$|Whenever {{multiple}} individuals {{contribute to}} the care of offspring, the optimum level of investment for each carer depends on the behaviour of the others. Previous theoretical and empirical work has largely focused on carer contributions within a single stage of a breeding attempt, neglecting the potential for investment during earlier stages to influence later care decisions. Typically, mothers have much greater control than other carers over the number and quality of offspring, and hence by altering her investment during offspring production a mother can adaptively adjust offspring phenotype to match or exploit the predicted care paradigm. In this dissertation, I use theoretical, empirical and comparative methods to investigate the influence of maternal tactics on investment rules in cooperative breeding systems, where ‘helpers’ care in addition to parents. In three chapters I model maternal control of offspring quality and offspring number across a cooperative breeding attempt, and investigate how the costliness of different reproductive stages, the kin-structure of the care group, and the consequences of offspring early-life condition influence the investment rules of carers. During offspring rearing, fair division of labour within a cooperative group can theoretically be resolved using simple turn-taking rules, leading to efficient outcomes for all carers. To test whether such a rule is employed in nature, a later chapter analyses empirical <b>provisioning</b> <b>data</b> from the chestnut-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus ruficeps), a cooperatively breeding bird endemic to the Australian outback. I use a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to determine whether individuals alter their provisioning rate when other carers visit the nest, and identify both ‘passive’ and ‘active’ turn-taking behaviour. Finally, I present a comparative analysis of studies on provisioning rules in cooperatively breeding birds, and investigate whether the level of investment mothers must contribute to offspring influences the later care paradigm observed. My results indicate that maternal costs contribute to variation in both breeding group size and female provisioning behaviour. I conclude that maternal investment tactics are an underappreciated influence on carer investment rules in both the theoretical and empirical literature, and that incorporating them is crucial to understanding variation in cooperative care behaviour in nature.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze the drivers and {{dynamics}} of credit losses in Australasian banking {{over an extended period}} of time in order to improve the means by which financial institutions manage their credit risks and regulatory bodies safeguard the stability and integrity of the financial system. The analysis is based on a specially constructed data base of credit loss and <b>provisioning</b> <b>data</b> retrieved from original financial reports published by Australian and New Zealand banks. The observation period covers 1980 to 2005, starting at the time when such information was published for the first time in bank financial statements. It moreover covers the time of major crises which occurred in both Australia and New Zealand in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. The heterogeneity of reporting the data both amongst banks and through time requires the development of a reporting typology which allows data extraction with equivalent informational content. As a thorough study of credit risks requires long data series often not available from third party data providers, the method developed here will provide value to a range of researchers. Based on an evaluation of many alternative proxies which track a bank's credit loss experience (CLE), the thesis proposes a preferred model for impaired assets expense (as % of loans) as dependent variable, mainly because of its timely nature and good data availability. Explanatory variables include aggregate macro variables of which changes in unemployment and the return in the share markets are found to have the most significant influence on a bank's credit losses. Bank-specific control variables include a pre-provision earnings proxy whose significance points to the use of provisions for the purpose of income smoothing by Australasian banks. The model also controls for size and nature of lending as smaller, retail-oriented housing lenders, on average, exhibit lower loan losses. Clear results are found with regard to the effect of rapid expansion which appears to be followed by a surge of bad debt provisions 2 to 3 years later. Moreover, inefficient banks tend to suffer greater credit losses. An important part of the thesis looks at the characteristics of alternative CLE proxies such as stock of provisions, impaired assets and write-offs which have been used by earlier literature. Estimating the preferred model with such alternative CLE parameters confirms their peculiarities such as the memory character of stock of provisions and the delayed nature of write-offs. These measures correlate rather poorly amongst themselves which calls for caution in the comparative interpretation of earlier studies that use differing CLE proxies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Greater {{transparency}} and, in particular, {{sharing of}} clinical study reports and patient level data {{for further research}} is an increasingly important topic for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry and other organisations who sponsor and conduct clinical research as well as academic researchers and patient advocacy groups. Statisticians are ambassadors for data sharing and are central to its success. They play an integral role in data sharing discussions within their companies and also externally helping to shape policy and processes while providing input into practical solutions to aid data sharing. Data sharing is generating changes in the required profile for statisticians in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, as well as academic institutions and patient advocacy groups. Discussion Successful statisticians need to possess many qualities required in today’s pharmaceutical environment such as collaboration, diplomacy, written and oral skills {{and an ability to}} be responsive; they are also knowledgeable when debating strategy and analytical techniques. However, increasing data transparency will require statisticians to evolve and learn new skills and behaviours during their career which may not have been an accepted part of the traditional role. Statisticians will move from being the gate-keepers of data to be data facilitators. To adapt successfully to this new environment, the role of the statistician is likely to be broader, including defining new responsibilities that lie beyond the boundaries of the traditional role. Statisticians should understand how data transparency can benefit them and the potential strategic advantage it can bring and be fully aware of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry commitments to data transparency and the policies within their company or research institute in addition to focusing on reviewing requests and <b>provisioning</b> <b>data.</b> Summary Data transparency will evolve the role of statisticians within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, academia and research bodies to a level which may not have been an accepted part of their traditional role or career. In the future, skills will be required to manage challenges arising from data sharing; statisticians will need strong scientific and statistical guiding principles for reanalysis and supplementary analyses based on researchers’ requests, have enhanced consultancy skills, in particular the ability to defend good statistical practice in the face of criticism and the ability to critique methods of analysis. Statisticians will also require expertise in data privacy regulations, data redaction and anonymisation and be able to assess the probability of re-identification, an ability to understand analyses conducted by researchers and recognise why such analyses may propose different results compared to the original analyses. Bringing these skills to the implementation of data sharing and interpretation of the results will help to maximise the value of shared data while guarding against misleading conclusions...|$|E

(1996). Multiple kagu Rhynochetos jubatus deaths caused by dog attacks at a high-altitude study site on Pic Ningua, New Caledonia. Bird Conservation International, 6 (4), 295 - 306. I carried out two phases of an internationally co-ordinated recovery project for the kagu Rhynochetos jubatus of New Caledonia between June 1991 and March 1995. In Phase One, between June 1991 and January 1992, I established kagu abundance and distribution on Grande Terre in the first comprehensive survey of the species outside Parc Rivière Bleue, where kagu distribution was known through Yves Létocart's work there. In 177 different listening areas, I recorded a total of 491 adult kagus, including 208 pairs, in 84 of the areas, mostly in Province Sud (403 birds; 177 pairs). Low kagu numbers (1 - 4 birds) were recorded in 56 % (n = 47) of the areas. More than nine kagus were recorded in each of 19 areas, which accounted for 57 % (n = 282) of all birds. In these 19 areas, virtually all birds sang from intact forest. Kagus occurred in 'patches' over a large area of the island, but mostly in inland mountainous regions. Analyses indicated that larger numbers of kagus {{were likely to be}} found on volcanic rock types and with increasing distance from human settlements. In Phase Two, from August 1992 to March 1995, I carried out a 32 -month field-research programme at two high altitude study areas, Pic Ningua and Mt Cindoa, with the main objective of investigating if food supply was limiting annual fecundity of kagus. I found that kagu pairs probably lived on relatively fixed territories year-round where independent offspring may also be present, as was the case at Parc Rivière Bleue. At Pic Ningua, one pair nested in early December 1994, and another also probably around that time in 1993, which contrasted with the main breeding period of June-August at Parc Rivière Bleue. I recorded no breeding at Mt Cindoa, where kagus' bodyweights were generally lower than those of birds at Pic Ningua, probably due to poorer food supplies at Mt Cindoa. Kagus appeared to moult their primary feathers annually between approximately December and May, starting in close association with hot, wet conditions in the wet season, as they appeared to do at Parc Rivière Bleue. Moult may be delayed or suspended in parents feeding chicks in the wet season. After dogs Canis familiaris killed most of the kagus I knew at Pic Ningua (see below), remaining birds quit or extended the territories they held before the attacks. This behaviour in widowed birds may have been mostly related to a search for mates. I found distinct seasonal patterns in kagu food supplies at high altitude closely related to seasonality in climate, especially temperature, and probably highly similar year-to-year. Food supplies peaked in the wet season and were lowest around late October when conditions were driest, and were also relatively spatially uniform in forest. It is not clear why birds do not generally use the period of peak food supplies for breeding, but it may be better for birds to moult their primary feathers at that time. Kagus were generalists in the types of the larger-sized soil and litter fauna they ate, and I recorded many new taxa not previously known to be eaten by the birds. Birds' diets were strongly influenced by seasonality in climate and food supplies, but they did not just track changing patterns in food availability. They were probably also a result of birds approaching local optima in the efficient use of available prey in response to changing environmental and physiological conditions. Birds appeared to use larger prey items when food was more abundant, and be least selective at times of greatest food scarcity in the driest periods. Birds used larvae at high frequencies in the early dry season; larvae might provide energy assimilation benefits in cold conditions. Bodyweights of mostly non-breeding kagus at Pic Ningua and Mt Cindoa varied seasonally in close positive association with temperature and food supplies, and varied negatively with use of sheltered roosts. Bodyweights peaked {{at the end of the}} wet season around April and were lowest in the driest period of the late dry season around late October. Lack of other factors likely to be affecting the kagus' bodyweights like competition, parasites and reproduction indicated that climate and food supplies were closely linked to the seasonal variation in them. The close association between variation in temperature and kagu bodyweights and roosting behaviour appeared to be clear evidence of phenotypic adjustment in roosting behaviour for energy conservation in response to cold conditions, particularly wind chill, and food shortage. There is little direct evidence that food supply is limiting the kagu's annual fecundity, but indirect support for this comes from, for example, the difficulty birds have in finding and capturing prey present in the soil and litter, and that they generally breed outside the period of peak food supplies and forage for long hours each day. More research is needed on whether food is limiting for aspects of kagu reproduction like egg formation and chick <b>provisioning.</b> <b>Data</b> suggest that the kagu's food supplies are independent of pair densities, thus the kagu's life history characteristics may have been strongly influenced by selection to maximise energy resources through interaction with the environment rather than by competition. This is consistent with aspects of the kagu's life history like for example its relatively non-competitive social organisation which means that birds can devote most of their time to foraging. I propose that density-independent food limitation has played an important role in shaping annual fecundity and other life history characteristics like social organisation in tropical, and possibly south temperate, forest birds. At Pic Ningua in 1993, I described the first documented case of multiple kagu deaths caused by dogs. Twenty kagus were found dead (15) or wounded (5; one survived) from dog attacks in four distinct episodes over a 14 week period from late April to early August. Older remains of two other birds were also found. Eighteen of the 22 birds wore radio-transmitters, and the four non-radio-tracked birds were found by chance. Dogs errant from a nearby tribal village were strongly implicated in carrying out most, if not all, of the attacks. The events on the peak showed that dogs are dangerous predators of adult kagus, and dog predation may have been important in shaping kagu distribution patterns. Four other important implications of my study for kagu conservation management are (1) the kagu's reproductive success may be greater in low altitude compared to high altitude rainforest; (2) because the kagu's clutch size is low and invariable, and the number of successful broods per year is also low and seems to be more influenced by density-independent factor(s), birds are especially vulnerable to predation because they cannot respond to lower densities by lifting their reproductive output; (3) feral pigs Sus scrofa at sufficiently high densities could potentially reduce prey availability for kagus; and (4) at least two additional managed reserves like Pare Rivière Bleue protecting up to 200 kagus are required to ensure that birds remain in the wild for the long term...|$|E
