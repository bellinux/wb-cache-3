The Keating Government introduced native title to Aborigines, greatly increased the social wage and the family benefits system, saw increased bilateral relations between Australia and countries in Asia, and vehemently promoted a vision of Australia as a republic.

Over the remainder of 1991, the economy {{showed no signs of}} recovery from the recession, and unemployment continued to rise. Opinion polling for Labor was poor, some of Keating's supporters actively undermined the government, and, perhaps more significantly, Liberal Leader John Hewson introduced 'Fightback!', an economic <b>policy</b> <b>package</b> which, according to Keating's biographer, [...] "appeared to astonish and stun Hawke's Cabinet". According to Edwards, [...] "Hawke was unprepared to attack it and responded with windy rhetoric". Following Hawke's lacklustre response to 'Fightback!', many began to openly speculate that nearly nine years as prime minister had left Hawke [...] "tired", and he began to lose the confidence of many in the Labor caucus. Keating was viewed as the only viable replacement for Hawke, and on 19 December 1991, Keating challenged Hawke for a second time, this time defeating him by 56 votes to 51.|$|E

40|$|The {{interdependence}} {{and complexity}} of socio-technical systems and availability {{of a wide variety}} of policy measures to address policy problems make the process of policy formulation difficult. In order to formulate sustainable and efficient transport policies, development of new tools and techniques is necessary. One of the approaches gaining ground is <b>policy</b> <b>packaging,</b> which shifts focus from implementation of individual policy measures to implementation of combinations of measures with the aim of increasing efficiency and effectiveness of policy interventions by increasing synergies and reducing potential contradictions among policy measures. In this paper, we describe the development of a virtual environment for the exploration and analysis of different configurations of policy measures in order to build <b>policy</b> <b>packages.</b> By developing systematic approaches it is possible to examine more alternatives at a greater depth, decrease the time required for the overall analysis, provide real-time assessment and feedback on the effect of changes in the configurations and ultimately form more effective policies.

40|$|To {{really make}} an impact on {{tackling}} climate change over the longer term {{and even in the}} next 10 â 20 years, it is necessary to think more strategically wabout global, national and city-wide futures. One approach to thinking about trend-breaking futures is to use visioning and backcasting as a form of scenario building. This paper presents the results of a recently completed project on backcasting for transport in London, where a 60 % reduction target in CO 2 emission levels (on 1990 levels) has been set for the transport to 2025. This challenging target is articulated through the baseline case and two images of the future, one pushing the technology harder and the other emphasising the role of behavioural change. Over 150 individual policy measures have been grouped together into mutually supporting <b>policy</b> <b>packages</b> that are in turn assembled into clusters of <b>policy</b> <b>packages</b> to see whether the targets set can be reached. A simulation model has been developed to test the multiple pathways to achieving the targets set, given a range of potentially different priority perspectives. The difficulty of reaching the targets set can be demonstrated, even if all of the <b>policy</b> <b>packages</b> are used to a âhighâ level of application.

50|$|A {{critical}} element of Douglas's economic <b>policy</b> <b>package,</b> {{but not the}} Labour Party's policy document, was a 20 per cent devaluation of the New Zealand dollar. This was a sensitive subject. If it was widely known that an incoming government would devalue the dollar, dealers would seek profit by selling the dollar at its higher price before the election, and buying it back at its lower price afterwards. The difference, which might amount to {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars if there was a run on the currency, would be met by the taxpayer. Soon after Muldoon called the election, Douglas held a public meeting in his electorate and distributed copies of his economic <b>policy</b> <b>package,</b> which made the case for a 20 per cent devaluation. Muldoon obtained a copy and released it to the news media, intending to embarrass the Labour Party. Douglas acknowledged that devaluation was not part of Labour policy and accepted responsibility for the mistake. Although Lange believed that the error cast doubt on Douglas's judgement, he did not accept Douglasâs resignation because he did not wish to appoint a new finance spokesperson so close to the election.|$|E

W H Oliver noted the close alignment of the package and Economic Management, Treasury's 1984 briefing to the incoming government. His assessment was that Douglas was predisposed towards the Treasury view because its implementation required decisive action and because greater reliance on the market solved what Douglas saw as the problem of interest-group participation in policy-making.|$|E
40|$|Indicators play an {{important}} role in the strategic assessment of <b>policy</b> <b>packages.</b> In this paper the role of indicators in assessing transport policies is examined. As case study, the European Common Transport Policy (CTP) is used. Its three main objectives may be summarized as 'efficiency', 'environment' and 'regional development'. Based on empirical research from different sources and the general CTP objectives, the main indicators for assessing the CTP are identified and discussed. Next, concise scenarios are constructed for the above mentioned general objectives within two general external frameworks (cooperation and polarisation), after which qualitative scores for the distinct indicators are calculated and presented. It appears that environmental and efficiency objectives may go hand in hand to some extent, especially by introducing price measures; regional development may however be contradictory with the achievement of the other objectives. It is concluded that indicators are a useful tool for assessing <b>policy</b> <b>packages,</b> by making the impacts of measures clearer and easily accessible for policy makers. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article makes a {{plea for}} a more {{explicitly}} intentional and political-strategic analysis of post-communist public policy pathways. The author analy-ses a set of social and labour-market policies implemented in the Czech Repub-lic (pro-active job loss prevention) compared to Hungary and Poland (large-scale non-elderly retirement), and indicates why, far from being fully constrained by structural or external variables or by international pressures, political elites were able to design <b>policy</b> <b>packages</b> that served to reduce anti-reform protests. Once enacted at a formative historical turning point, these early policies fundamen-tally reshaped the subsequent operational space of post-communist politics throughout the 1990 s. They crystallised the distinct pathways of post-communist welfare regimes, and they enabled early, and irreversible, democratic and market reform progress. While seemingly inefficient, and definitely costly in public-fi-nance terms, these <b>policy</b> <b>packages</b> contained a degree of political rationality, as they contributed to {{the making of the}} great Czech, Hungarian, and Polish tran-sition success stories, in an otherwise highly heterogeneous population of post-communist transition cases...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} has been to explore success factors and {{barriers}} to the formation and implementation of single policy measures and <b>policy</b> <b>packages</b> in transport, and to identify strategies to manage such barriers. As a first step, we developed a typology of barriers and success factors for policy formation and implementation. Secondly, we carried out an empirical analysis of barriers and success factors in four cases of policy packaging: Urban Congestion Charging; National Heavy Vehicle Fees; Aviation in the European Emissions Trading System and The EUâs First Railway Package. The third and final task was to identify more general strategies to manage barriers in policy formation and implementation. A main conclusion in this report is that a conscious application of these strategies may contribute significantly to successful formation and implementation of even controversial <b>policies</b> or <b>policy</b> <b>packages.</b> QC 20130115 OPTIC - Optimal Policies for Transport in Combination, Grant Agreement No:No TREN/FP 7 TR/ 233681 /"OPTIC...|$|R
