40|$|This paper uses a Stackelberg game {{to analyze}} the problem of {{taxation}} by a benevolent social planner {{in the face of}} costly tax compliance. The social planner minimizes deadweight loss subject to a marginal benefit of tax revenues. I ask whether it is optimal in this case to introduce an alternative <b>presumptive</b> <b>income</b> tax, and I find conditions for its optimal tax rates. I model the production and tax return filing decisions of risk-neutral firms facing a hybrid tax system that allows them to choose between a self-assessed tax on profits and a <b>presumptive</b> <b>income</b> tax. Anybody can choose to file under the presumptive regime, but in order to file under the self-assessed regime, a taxpayer must keep costly accounting books. The cost of bookkeeping differs across firms. The model implies that, in the presence of costly tax compliance, a benevolent social planner with a given marginal value of tax revenue can always enhance social welfare if she allows taxpayers the alternative of filing a <b>presumptive</b> <b>income</b> tax return.

Income and consumption data produce conflicting results. Based on income data, including average <b>presumptive</b> agricultural <b>incomes</b> and state sector wages, there is a significant rise in real income in rural areas and a decline in real income in urban areas. Based on food consumption data, however, a large decline in urban real incomes is implausible.

This paper contrasts this wealth tax with a conventional realization-based capital gains tax, a retrospective capital gains tax with interest on the deferred tax, and a mark-to-market tax which taxes capital gains as they accrue.

Such a method of assessment, known as <b>presumptive</b> <b>income</b> taxation, is widely used in many developing and industrial countries; however, it has been neglected in public finance literature.

Second, would <b>presumptive</b> <b>income</b> taxation contribute to macroeconomic instability because it lacks the automatic stabilizer property of standard progressive income taxation? Two simple models suggest that there is scope for increasing revenue under presumptive taxation without necessarily undermining economic stability.

40|$|This Article {{highlights}} the primary tax enforcement {{problem in the}} United States, that of noncompliant {{small and medium-sized businesses}} (“SMBs”), and it explores the possibility of a radical solution: shifting away from the current system, which attempts to tax the actual income of each business, and toward a system that taxes only a rough approximation (or probabilistic estimate) of business income. This sort of presumptive tax approach has been used for years in developing economies, where the problem of SMB noncompliance is even worse than in the U. S. This Article argues {{that the time has come}} to at least consider various ways of taxing SMBs in the U. S. on a presumptive basis as well. The particular regime that the Article spends the most time developing is a type of modified gross receipts (MGR) tax of the sort that is used in some developing economies. Under our version of the MGR approach, SMB taxpayers would be taxed on a rough estimate of their annual income using (a) their reported gross receipts and (b) presumed profit ratios based on historical line-of-business profit margins. Whether such a regime would make sense depends on a number of key unanswered questions, including how narrowly and accurately such historical line-of-business profit percentages can be drawn and at what cost. We also discuss whether such a regime should be mandatory or optional; and, if mandatory, whether it should be only a mandatory minimum (like the alternative minimum tax) or both a minimum and maximum. Moving to an MGR approach to taxing SMB income would require a major change in the Internal Revenue Code. As a more modest alternative, the Article also considers instead having the IRS begin to use presumptive-tax principles as part of their audit strategies. If the Service could credibly commit to applying some form of presumptive/probabilistic tax system in its auditing decisions (perhaps as part of the Discriminate Index Function), and if taxpayers reacted rationally to such an audit policy, the results could be similar to an optional <b>presumptive</b> business <b>income</b> tax...|$|R

The multi-period implication of the split rule is analysed, taking the opportunity return on the net assets into account, and how it blocks income shifting. Capital income dividends from non-listed companies on average are economic income from capital. However, high opportunity wage professionals, whose marginal tax rate on earned income exceeds the double-tax rate on undistributed corporate profits, potentially benefit from using non-listed companies as piggy banks.

40|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1990 s, the Baltics, Russia, and other (BRO) {{countries}} of the former Soviet Union initiated tax reforms that varied widely at the later stages. Recently, some of the BRO countries, basing decisions on the proposition that lowering of the top marginal income tax rate would significantly benefit economic development and increase tax compliance, have initiated a new stage of tax reforms. This paper reviews country experiences and suggests that (i) overall, {{there seems to be}} little evidence of a substantial improvement in income tax revenues resulting simply from a reduction in the top marginal tax rates, and (ii) in the BRO countries, the elasticity of the behavior of economic agents, in terms of labor supply, saving, and investment, with respect to income tax rates is not large, and a reduction of the existing income tax rates is unlikely to lead to a notable expansion of economic activity.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} four {{papers in}} the area of Public Economics. Chapter 1 looks at producers' taxation in a model of vertically related oligopolies. Both ad valorem and specific taxes are considered and formulae expressing their effects on prices and profits are derived, showing how these depend on factors such as demand conditions, technology and market structure. Conditions for taxation to cause price overshifting and to raise profits are given. Also, tax instruments are compared in terms of the amount of revenue collected and the effect on the price for the final good. Chapter 2 applies the results of the previous paper to the analysis of tax reforms. Vertically related oligopolies result in welfare loss for two reasons. Firstly, upstream oligopolists set the price of the intermediate good above marginal cost and this causes aggregate production inefficiency. Secondly, downstream oligopolists introduce an additional price-cost margin. The analysis focuses on tax reforms, where the government aims at reducing the welfare loss by levying taxes and subsidies on producers while raising no revenue. Chapter 3 focuses on the design of income tax enforcement policies in a principalagent framework. The existing literature assumes risk neutral taxpayers while this chapter considers the case of risk averse agents by assuming a kinked linear utility function. When individuals have the same attitude towards risk, it is shown that the optimal policy is such that income reports below a given threshold are audited at the probability level just sufficient to induce truthful reporting, whereas those above it are not audited. This makes the effective tax schedule to be quite regressive. Instead, if attitudes towards risk vary across taxpayers, the numerical results show that the optimal audit policy causes only a limited regressive bias, for income reports above the threshold meet a positive probability of audit. Chapter 4 examines the <b>Presumptive</b> <b>Income</b> Coefficients (PIC) audit policy, a scheme recently introduced in the Italian tax code and aimed at reducing tax evasion in the non-corporate sector. The tax agency applies the PIC to observable production costs to get an estimate of taxpayer's income, or <b>presumptive</b> <b>income.</b> The probability of audit is then dependent on the gap between presumptive and reported income. This issue is examined in a setting where the game between the taxing authority and taxpayers is modelled in a principal-agent framework...|$|E
40|$|The 1986 {{tax reform}} in Bolivia {{was one of}} the most radical {{effective}} changes of tax policies that any country has undertaken in modern times. After the reform the country was left with a uniform rate of tariff, a uniform value added tax, a set of taxes to complement the vat, a set of excise taxes on specific consumption items, a low turnover tax, a <b>presumptive</b> <b>income</b> tax on corporations, a property tax, and an inheritance tax. Five years later, the tax policies remain largely the same. Bolivia is facing a major revenue shortfall in the next two years. Sales of natural gas to Argentina have been an important source of the revenues of the government and they are anticipated to fall substantially over the next 2 or 3 years. To offset this decline in revenues, and to meet increased government obligations, it is proposed that revenues will have to increase by 1. 5 per cent of GDP next year and 2. 0 per cent of the GDP in the following year. The strategy to meet this revenue gap is to first improve the administration of taxes to the greatest degree possible and then to consider new tax bases and higher tax rates.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the use of}} <b>Presumptive</b> <b>Income</b> Tax (PIT) {{in developing}} countries with large informal economies dominated by small business. It asks the question: &# 147;Are the current PIT designs used to tax small business in large informal economies appropriate?&# 148; To answer the question, this thesis makes a qualitative analysis {{of the causes of}} large informal economies in developing countries. Then, common PIT designs are evaluated qualitatively against the principles of a good tax system. Finally, legal analysis of Pakistani PIT legislation is undertaken with particular reference to the principles of a good tax system. This thesis makes a number of important contributions to the existing body of knowledge. First this thesis identifies the bookkeeping and other procedural requirements for tax compliance as the major reason why small businesses operate informally. Second, this thesis identifies a single PIT (that is, an asset based PIT) amongst a range of PIT designs, which logically is the most appropriate design {{to meet the needs of}} small business and tax administration in large informal economies. This identification is achieved by comparative analysis of PIT designs against the causes of informality. Third, earlier literature has not made comparative analysis of existing PIT designs against the principles of a good tax system for assessing their adequacy to tackle large informal economies. This thesis performs this task and finds that an asset based PIT is the most appropriate among all PIT designs in this regard. Fourth, prior to the analysis of PIT designs against the principles of a good tax system this thesis makes a contribution in the existing literature in terms of redefining and prioritizing these principles in context of large informal economies. This thesis suggests ranking simplicity, efficiency and equity in that order. Lastly this thesis provides the first ever comprehensive analysis of the Pakistani PIT to assess its ability to tax the informal sector and the level of its adherence to the principles of a good tax system. This thesis finds that the Pakistani PIT does not satisfy the principles of simplicity, efficiency and equity because of its inappropriate design, poor legal drafting and its intricate relationship with the normal income tax. The thesis recommends an asset based PIT along with details regarding its base, valuation techniques etc to tax the Pakistani informal economy...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The thesis {{attempts}} to explore an efficient policy and administrative framework to tax the {{small businesses in}} developing countries. In order to approach the policy and administrative problems concerning the taxation of small business in developing countries this thesis asks How can small businesses be efficiently taxed in developing countries? This thesis over eight chapters qualitatively explores this research question. The analyses conclude that first, in a typical developing country a well-designed simple to follow presumptive tax regime is more efficient than the actual account based tax system. Second, this thesis argues that the noncompliance of small businesses in developing countries may not be adequately explained by the standard expected utility based compliance models. The leading tax compliance models which mainly emphasise on the perceived reward from evasion might ignore some crucial factor that constitutes the tax compliance environment of small businesses in developing countries. This thesis illustrates broadly the typical tax compliance environment of small businesses. It argues that a simple to follow tax system that requires a minimal level of taxpayer compliance would attract a section of small taxpayers into the formal tax net. Third, this thesis demonstrates that there are crucial differences between typical urban and rural businesses. A small business tax regime should have a separate set of presumptive instruments for each class of small business {{in order to make}} an efficient estimate of their economic activities. Fourth, this thesis analytically examines the presumptive methods and their practical applications. The findings suggest that in developing countries presumptive tax methods have been adopted mostly in arbitrary manner, without the objective considerations to many crucial design issues. Fifth, this thesis has developed a focused analysis on the taxation of urban small businesses in the contexts of developing countries. This thesis analyses some crucial characteristics of urban small businesses and stresses that enterprise formalization should be a key element of urban small business tax policy. For a meaningful expansion of the tax net, tax administration should put more focus on urban small businesses as these businesses have relatively more potential to grow as more stable and sustained taxpayers. This thesis concludes that a turnover based presumptive taxation is more efficient to tax the urban small businesses. Lastly, this thesis explores the issues concerning the taxation of rural small businesses. This thesis reports that the overall tax burden on the agricultural income had substantially declined over the last few decades. Developing countries should not ignore the tax potential of the rural taxpayers. In a typical developing country an asset based presumptive tax system is more efficient to tax the agricultural income of the rural small businesses. This thesis has argued that it would be more efficient to adopt a single asset based <b>presumptive</b> <b>income</b> tax replacing all the prevailing taxes on the agricultural income such as agricultural land tax, wealth tax and income tax...|$|E
