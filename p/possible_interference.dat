25|$|In {{addition}} to artifacts {{generated by the}} body, many artifacts originate from outside the body. Movement by the patient, or even just settling of the electrodes, may cause electrode pops, spikes originating from a momentary change in the impedance of a given electrode. Poor grounding of the EEG electrodes can cause significant 50 or 60nbsp&Hz artifact, depending on the local power system's frequency. A third source of <b>possible</b> <b>interference</b> can be {{the presence of an}} IV drip; such devices can cause rhythmic, fast, low-voltage bursts, which may be confused for spikes.|$|E

30|$|A short HPLC-column {{was placed}} as a {{pre-column}} between purge valve and autosampler to separate background PFCA and PFAS from the analytes of the samples. An injector program {{was used to}} minimize potential cross-contamination from heavily contaminated samples as far as <b>possible.</b> <b>Interferences</b> of PFOS with taurodeoxycholic acid are excluded, because both substances are separated chromatographically and furthermore {{the relation of the}} two most intensive transitions of PFOS in comparison to a standard solution was used to check <b>possible</b> <b>interferences.</b> Taurodeoxycholic acid does not show the m/z transition 499 to 99, which is specific for PFOS.

25|$|Mobile phone use on {{aircraft}} {{is starting}} to be allowed with several airlines already offering {{the ability to use}} phones during flights. Mobile phone use during flights used to be prohibited and many airlines still claim in their in-plane announcements that this prohibition is due to <b>possible</b> <b>interference</b> with aircraft radio communications. Shut-off mobile phones do not interfere with aircraft avionics. The recommendation why phones should not be used during take-off and landing, even on planes that allow calls or messaging, is so that passengers pay attention to the crew for any possible accident situations, as most aircraft accidents happen on take-off and landing.|$|E
25|$|On 16 October 1990, the UN General Assembly {{decided to}} grant the ICRC {{observer}} status for its assembly sessions and sub-committee meetings, the first observer status given to a private organization. The resolution was jointly proposed by 138 member states and introduced by the Italian ambassador, Vieri Traxler, {{in memory of the}} organization's origins in the Battle of Solferino. An agreement with the Swiss government signed on 19 March 1993, affirmed the already long-standing policy of full independence of the Committee from any <b>possible</b> <b>interference</b> by Switzerland. The agreement protects the full sanctity of all ICRC property in Switzerland including its headquarters and archive, grants members and staff legal immunity, exempts the ICRC from all taxes and fees, guarantees the protected and duty-free transfer of goods, services, and money, provides the ICRC with secure communication privileges at the same level as foreign embassies, and simplifies Committee travel in and out of Switzerland.|$|E
500|$|Ruth {{joined the}} Grays on August 18, 1914. After Dunn's deals, the Baltimore Orioles {{managed to hold}} on to first place until August 15, after which they {{continued}} to fade, leaving the pennant race between Providence and Rochester. Ruth was deeply impressed by Providence manager [...] "Wild Bill" [...] Donovan, previously a star pitcher with a 25–4 win–loss record for Detroit in 1907; in later years, he credited Donovan with teaching him much about pitching. Ruth was often called upon to pitch, in one stretch starting (and winning) four games in eight days. On September 5 at Maple Leaf Park in Toronto, Ruth pitched a one-hit 9–0 victory, and hit his first professional home run, his only one as a minor leaguer, off Ellis Johnson. Recalled to Boston after Providence finished the season in first place, he pitched and won a game for the Red Sox against the New York Yankees on October 2, getting his first major league hit, a double. Ruth finished the season with a record of 2–1 as a major leaguer and 23–8 in the International League (for Baltimore and Providence). Once the season concluded, Ruth married Helen in Ellicott City, Maryland. Creamer speculated that they did not marry in Baltimore, where the newlyweds boarded with George Ruth Sr., to avoid <b>possible</b> <b>interference</b> from those at St. Mary's—both bride and groom were not yet of age and Ruth remained on parole from that institution until his 21st birthday.|$|E

2500|$|Next was {{the grade}} I FrontRunner Stakes on September 26 at Santa Anita. At [...] mile, this was Nyquist's first race around two turns. He faced eight rivals and was made the 1–2 favorite. Nyquist {{fought for the}} early lead and entered the first turn three wide. Gutierrez then settled him just off the pace through a {{moderate}} half mile in 47.01 seconds. Nyquist went to the lead {{at the top of}} the stretch and then held off a stretch drive by Swipe to win. There was a stewards' inquiry regarding <b>possible</b> <b>interference</b> down the stretch, but the results stood. The margin of victory was only three-quarters of a length, which, combined with a relatively slow time, led to questions about his stamina.|$|E
2500|$|When {{collecting}} {{data in the}} full scan mode, a target range of mass fragments is determined and put into the instrument's method. [...] An example of a typical broad range of mass fragments to monitor would be m/z 50 to m/z 400. [...] The determination of what range to use is largely dictated by what one anticipates being in the sample while being cognizant of the solvent and other possible interferences. [...] A MS should not be set to look for mass fragments too low or else one may detect air (found as m/z 28 due to nitrogen), carbon dioxide (m/z 44) or other <b>possible</b> <b>interference.</b> [...] Additionally if one {{is to use a}} large scan range then sensitivity of the instrument is decreased due to performing fewer scans per second since each scan will have to detect a wide range of mass fragments.|$|E
2500|$|In {{elections}} of November 1937, the Georgists {{joined with the}} National Peasants' Party and the Iron Guard in the electoral pact {{that was meant to}} protect the opposition from all <b>possible</b> <b>interference</b> of the Tătărescu government in the results of the voting. The uniquely indecisive results of the voting allowed Carol to form a loyal executive around the far right National Christian Party and its leaders, Octavian Goga and A. C. Cuza; the Georgists remained in opposition to the new government, and began talks for a reconciliation with the PNL, after the defeated Tătărescu lost ground to the [...] "old liberal" [...] leadership around Dinu Brătianu (the second brother of Ion I. C. and the uncle of Gheorghe). The reunion occurred exactly a month before Carol dismissed the Goga government and, nominally outlawing all parties to create the National Renaissance Front, established his own dictatorship. When Tătărescu chose to back the regime and was expelled, Gheorghe I. Brătianu became replaced his rival as the second most important figure of the semi-clandestine party, and agreed to join the National Peasants' Party in voicing criticism of Carol's authoritarian policies.|$|E

6000|$|But besides thus {{using his}} beneficent {{authority}} to prevent {{subjects of the}} Transvaal from trespassing on their neighbour's land, the Resident is to exercise a general supervision over the interests of all the natives in the country. Considering that they number about a million, and are scattered over a territory larger than France, {{one would think that}} this duty alone would have taken up the time of any ordinary man; and, indeed, Sir Evelyn Wood was in favour of the appointment of sub-residents to assist him. The majority of the Commission refused, however, to listen to any such suggestion--believing, they said, [...] "that the least <b>possible</b> <b>interference</b> with the independent Government of the State would be the wisest." [...] Quite so, but I suppose it never occurred to them to ask the natives what their views of the matter were! The Resident was also {{to be a member of}} a Native Location Committee, which was at some future time, to provide land for natives to live on.|$|E
60|$|Private practice, thus protected, would itself protect individuals, {{as far as}} such {{protection}} is possible, against the errors and superstitions of State medicine, which are at worst no worse than the errors and superstitions of private practice, being, indeed, all derived from it. Such monstrosities as vaccination are, as we have seen, founded, not on science, but on half-crowns. If the Vaccination Acts, instead of being wholly repealed as they are already half repealed, were strengthened by compelling every parent to have his child vaccinated by a public officer whose salary was completely independent {{of the number of}} vaccinations performed by him, and for whom there was plenty of alternative public health work waiting, vaccination would be dead in two years, as the vaccinator would not only not gain by it, but would lose credit through the depressing effects on the vital statistics of his district of the illness and deaths it causes, whilst it would take from him all the credit of that freedom from smallpox which is the result of good sanitary administration and vigilant prevention of infection. Such absurd panic scandals as that of the last London epidemic, where a fee of half-a-crown per re-vaccination produced raids on houses during the absence of parents, and the forcible seizure and re-vaccination of children left to answer the door, can be prevented simply by abolishing the half-crown and all similar follies, paying, not for this or that ceremony of witchcraft, but for immunity from disease, and paying, too, in a rational way. The officer with a fixed salary saves himself trouble by doing his business with the least <b>possible</b> <b>interference</b> with the private citizen. The man paid by the job loses money by not forcing his job on the public as often as possible without reference to its results.|$|E
60|$|Not unbewildered, {{again he}} gazed off for his boat. But it was {{temporarily}} hidden by a rocky {{spur of the}} isle. As with some eagerness he bent forward, watching for the first shooting view of its beak, the balustrade gave way before him like charcoal. Had he not clutched an outreaching rope he would have fallen into the sea. The crash, though feeble, and the fall, though hollow, of the rotten fragments, must have been overheard. He glanced up. With sober curiosity peering down upon him {{was one of the}} old oakum-pickers, slipped from his perch to an outside boom; while below the old negro, and, invisible to him, reconnoitering from a port-hole like a fox from the mouth of its den, crouched the Spanish sailor again. From something suddenly suggested by the man's air, the mad idea now darted into Captain Delano's mind, that Don Benito's plea of indisposition, in withdrawing below, was but a pretense: that he was engaged there maturing his plot, of which the sailor, by some means gaining an inkling, had a mind to warn the stranger against; incited, it may be, by gratitude for a kind word on first boarding the ship. Was it from foreseeing some <b>possible</b> <b>interference</b> like this, that Don Benito had, beforehand, given such a bad character of his sailors, while praising the negroes; though, indeed, the former seemed as docile as the latter the contrary? The whites, too, by nature, were the shrewder race. A man with some evil design, would he not be likely to speak well of that stupidity which was blind to his depravity, and malign that intelligence from which it might not be hidden? Not unlikely, perhaps. But if the whites had dark secrets concerning Don Benito, could then Don Benito be any way in complicity with the blacks? But they were too stupid. Besides, who ever heard of a white so far a renegade as to apostatize from his very species almost, by leaguing in against it with negroes? These difficulties recalled former ones. Lost in their mazes, Captain Delano, who had now regained the deck, was uneasily advancing along it, when he observed a new face; an aged sailor seated cross-legged near the main hatchway. His skin was shrunk up with wrinkles like a pelican's empty pouch; his hair frosted; his countenance grave and composed. His hands were full of ropes, which he was working into a large knot. Some blacks were about him obligingly dipping the strands for him, here and there, as the exigencies of the operation demanded.|$|E

40|$|In our {{thermodynamic}} theoretical {{study we}} concentrated {{our attention on}} thermodynamics of gas-solid desulfurization reactions (H 2 S, COS, thiophene), properties of sorbents (melting point evaporation), attainable equilibrium sulfur compounds concentrations in gas at temperature 500 – 1100 K (227 - 827 oC) under conditions typical for producer gas composition. Similarly removal of HCl and HF by Ce, La, Zn, Mn and Ni oxides based sorbents is described and <b>possible</b> <b>interferences</b> in simultaneous sorption of HCl or HF with H 2 S are analyzed.
