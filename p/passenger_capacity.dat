5|$|International flights that {{bypassed}} traditional hub {{airports and}} landed at smaller cities became more common throughout the 1980s, and this eroded the 747's original market. However, many international carriers {{continued to use}} the 747 on Pacific routes. In Japan, 747s on domestic routes were configured to carry close to the maximum <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary 2 is a post-Panamax ship. As a result, Queen Mary 2 must {{circumnavigate}} South America {{to cross}} between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The {{decision not to}} constrain her size to transit the Panama Canal was taken as Queen Elizabeth 2 only transited once a year, during the world cruise. Cunard decided to pass up the convenience of the occasional passage in favour of a greater <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alster was {{launched}} on 5 January 1928, and completed on 25 February 1928. She {{was built for}} Norddeutscher Lloyd. The Code Letters QMHG were allocated and her port of registry was Bremen. She served on routes between Germany and Australia and East Asia. Lloyds Register entries show that she held a passenger certificate from 1934–40. With the change in Code Letters in 1934, Alster was allocated DOEO as her callsign. She had a crew of 69 and could initially take 14 passengers. In 1930 the <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity</b> was increased to 16.|$|E
50|$|Sultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman Airport is the 6th busiest {{airport in}} Indonesia and the busiest airport in Kalimantan and Borneo, but the traffic {{continues}} to fall sharply. From October to December 2014 (in 5-15 million <b>passengers</b> <b>capacity</b> category), Sultan Aji Muhammad Sulaiman Airport becomes the world's 16th best in Airport Service Quality {{or the best}} in Southeast Asia by Airport Council International survey among 79 airports with <b>passengers</b> <b>capacity</b> between 5-15 million a year.|$|R
5000|$|Grivbuz 7U midibus {{built in}} {{collaboration}} with Roman in 2001, and updated in 2003. Such buses have 44 <b>passengers</b> <b>capacity</b> and have been operating {{in the city of}} Tulcea.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1909 model year, Cadillac {{introduced}} the new Model Thirty. This new car {{was based on}} the Model G and replaced all 1908 Models. The Model 30 was bodied in various configurations and <b>passenger</b> <b>capacities.</b>|$|R
5|$|By the 1970s {{the airport}} was again {{in need of}} {{expansion}} and modernization. In 1973 the newly created Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority (MNAA) finalized a master plan to coordinate the long-term growth of the airport along projected increases in needed <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity.</b> This plan included {{the building of a}} new terminal and a new parallel runway across Donelson Pike to handle increasing operations by reducing the time between consecutive takeoffs and landings.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} she {{departed}} westwards across the Atlantic she was carrying 892crew members and 1,320passengers. This was {{only about half of}} her full <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity</b> of 2,435, as it was the low season and shipping from the UK had been disrupted by a coal miners' strike. Her passengers were a cross-section of Edwardian society, from millionaires such as John Jacob Astor and Benjamin Guggenheim, to poor emigrants from countries as disparate as Armenia, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Syria and Russia seeking a new life in America.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Boeing studied the {{development}} of a shorter 747 with three engines, to compete with the smaller L-1011 TriStar and DC-10. The 747 trijet would have had more payload, range, and <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity</b> than the L-1011 and DC-10. The center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an S-duct intake similar to the L-1011's. However, engineering studies showed that a total redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary. Maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining. Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four-engine 747, resulting in the 747SP.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{type that}} is 3 m long, having a 4 to 8 <b>passengers</b> <b>capacity,</b> and another type that is 6 m long, having around 30 <b>passengers</b> <b>capacity.</b> Some slope cars are [...] "trainsets" [...] {{consisting}} of two cars. Most slope cars are straddle-beam monorails, but there are suspended monorail slope cars as well. Normal monorails generally use rubber tyres running on a concrete beam, while slope cars use a steel beam with a rack rail on one side. As such, slope cars can climb 100% (45°) slopes at maximum speed. The system {{is powered by a}} [...] "third rail" [...] {{on the other side of}} the beam.|$|R
50|$|Ambrolauri Airport {{is a small}} airport serving Ambrolauri, a town in Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti, Georgia. As of 2017, {{the airport}} can serve {{airplanes}} with 30-50 <b>passengers</b> <b>capacity.</b> It is also planned to further enlarge the airport.|$|R
50|$|The Alero has an Iveco {{engine and}} {{a choice of}} manual or {{automatic}} ZF transmission. It typically seats between twelve and sixteen <b>passengers,</b> <b>capacity</b> being partly dependent upon whether space is provided for a wheelchair. The destination display box is optional.|$|R
5|$|The {{baseline}} A320 {{has given}} rise to a family of aircraft which share a common design but with <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity</b> ranges from 100, on the A318, to 220, on the A321. They compete with the 737, 757, and 717. Because the four variants share the same flight deck, all have the same pilot type rating. Today all variants are available as corporate jets. An A319 variant known as A319LR is also developed. Military version like A319 MPA also exists. American Airlines is the world's largest airline operator of the A320 family of aircraft with 392 aircraft in service as of 30 September 2017.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia {{possesses}} 673 {{airports in}} 2013, ranging from grand international airports to modest unpaved airstrips on remote islands or inland interior areas located throughout the archipelago. In November 2011, Indonesia {{had more than}} 230 conventional airports, most of them operated by Transportation Ministry technical operation units and state-owned PT Angkasa Pura I & II. Major airports are managed by Angkasa Pura; Angkasa Pura I operates 13 airports in Eastern Indonesia, while Angkasa Pura II operates 13 airports in Western Indonesia. After the 2000 aviation deregulation, Indonesian airports endured a surge of passengers, especially catalyzed by the advent of low-cost carriers. According to the Indonesian Transportation Ministry, 9 of the 13 airports managed by PT Angkasa Pura I have exceeded their <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Smaller {{communities}} are served via heliports which connect with hubs located at Upernavik Airport in the Upernavik Archipelago in northwestern Greenland; at Uummannaq Heliport in the Uummannaq Fjord region in northwestern Greenland; at Ilulissat and Aasiaat Airports in the Disko Bay region in western Greenland; at Qaqortoq and Nanortalik Heliports in southern Greenland; and at Tasiilaq Heliport in southeastern Greenland. Of the 45 heliports in use, 8 are primary and {{equipped with a}} tarmac, a terminal building and permanent staff. The other heliports are helistops with either a gravel or grass landing area. Often helicopters need to make more than one flight for each connection to a fixed-wing flight because of <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity,</b> causing longer total travel time.|$|E
50|$|Terminal 2 has {{undergone}} a major refurbishment recently, extending check-in and boarding facilities, changing the interior and exterior décor, and offering more dining choices to <b>passengers.</b> <b>Capacity</b> was increased to allow for 10 million passengers, an increase of 5 million.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Juanda International Airport {{becomes the}} world's 10th best in Airport Service Quality by Airport Council International among 79 {{airports}} with <b>passengers</b> <b>capacity</b> between 5-15 million a year. And in Q1 2015 this airport increased becomes the world's 7th Airport by ACI.|$|R
50|$|Fully {{assembled}} with refurbished engines, {{some also}} have air-conditioning units, most popularly in Makati City. Most of these jeepneys have radically expanded <b>passenger</b> <b>capacities,</b> and are flamboyant and noisy. Many jeeps from this generation {{are notorious for}} belching smoke and almost all run on diesel fuel.|$|R
5|$|The {{light rail}} model {{would have used}} the same {{approach}} as the tram in Ørestad, but would instead have run through a tunnel in the city centre. The tunnel sections would be shorter, but the diameter larger {{because it would have}} to accommodate overhead wires. The system would have the same frequency as the tram, but use double trams and would therefore require larger stations. The metro solution was chosen because it combined the highest average speeds, the highest <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity,</b> the lowest visual and noise impact, and the lowest number of accidents. Despite requiring the highest investment, it had the highest net present value.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, the MTA has started several {{projects}} to maintain and improve the subway. In the 1990s, it started converting the BMT Canarsie Line to use communications-based train control, utilizing a moving block signal system that allowed more trains to use the tracks and thus increasing <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity.</b> After the Canarsie Line tests were successful, the MTA expanded the automation program in the 2000s and 2010s to include other lines. As part of another program called FASTRACK, the MTA started closing certain lines during weekday nights in 2012, {{with each of the}} lines closing overnight for a week in order to allow workers to clean these lines without being hindered by train movements. It expanded the program beyond Manhattan the next year after noticing how efficient the FASTRACK program was compared to previous service diversions. In 2015, the MTA announced a wide-ranging improvement program as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program. Thirty stations would be extensively rebuilt under the Enhanced Station Initiative, and new R211 subway cars would be able to fit more passengers.|$|E
5|$|The 7000 {{series of}} cars, {{currently}} being built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company of Kobe, Japan are being delivered for on-site testing during winter 2013, and first entered service April 14, 2015 on the Blue Line. The new cars {{are different from}} previous models in that while still operating as married pairs, the cab in one car was eliminated, {{turning it into a}} B car. The new design allows for increased <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity,</b> elimination of redundant equipment, greater energy efficiency, and lower maintenance costs. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation of the fatal June 22, 2009, accident led it to conclude that the 1000 series cars are unsafe and unable to protect passengers in a crash. As a result, on July 26, 2010, Metro voted to purchase 300 7000 series cars to replace the remaining 1000 series cars. An additional 128 7000 series cars were also ordered to serve the new Silver Line to Dulles Airport (64 for each phase). In May 2013, Metro placed another order for 100 7000 series cars, which will replace all of the 4000 series cars. On July 13, 2015, WMATA used their final option and purchased an additional 220 7000 series railcars for fleet expansion, bringing the total number of 7000 series railcars on order to 748.|$|E
30|$|<b>Capacity</b> of <b>passengers</b> The {{maximum number}} of people who can occupy or cross a service element is {{equivalent}} to the <b>capacity</b> of the <b>passengers,</b> and the unit is the number of individuals per minute or {{in terms of the number}} of people per minute per width. The maximum capacity indicates the {{maximum number of}} <b>passengers,</b> and design <b>capacity</b> indicates the maximum number of desirable <b>passengers.</b> <b>Capacity</b> of station can be increased with improving pedestrian’s flow.|$|R
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, VAL (Véhicule Automatique Léger) {{systems are}} categorized in the medium-capacity rail systems family because their manufacturer defines their <b>passenger</b> <b>capacities</b> as being up to 30,000 p/h/d. A nonprofit organization, the Light Rail Transit Association (LRTA) also categorizes several public transport systems as [...] "light metro".|$|R
50|$|Higher {{fuel costs}} and lower <b>passenger</b> <b>capacities</b> {{due to the}} {{aerodynamic}} requirement for a narrow fuselage make SSTs an expensive form of commercial civil transportation compared with subsonic aircraft. For example, the Boeing 747 can carry {{more than three times}} as many passengers as Concorde while using approximately the same amount of fuel.|$|R

25|$|Her {{capacity}} was 988 {{passengers and}} 577 crew, {{for a total}} of 1,565 people, though the <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity</b> was changed twice between the two classes (first class and tourist/second class).|$|E
50|$|In 2015, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of the Organization of Kish Free Trade Zone (FTZ), a new terminal is planned for construction. The new terminal would turn Kish International Airport into the 2nd largest airport of the country with a 4.5 million <b>passengers</b> <b>capacity</b> per year. 2.7 million passengers travelled through the airport that year.|$|R
50|$|First {{seen in the}} 1970s as the {{so-called}} taxi colectivo (share taxi or collective cab), peseros were originally big cars with fixed routes which would pick passengers at any point through their route, and drop them off also at any point. <b>Passenger</b> <b>capacities</b> were limited to those of a large car (usually up to six people plus a driver).|$|R
5000|$|A rapid transit, underground, subway, tube, elevated, metro or Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) {{system is}} a railway—usually in an urban area—with high <b>passenger</b> <b>capacities</b> and {{frequency}} of service, and (usually) full grade separation from other traffic (including other rail traffic). It is often known as [...] "heavy rail" [...] to distinguish it from light rail and bus rapid transit.|$|R
25|$|Built in 1984 by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. Aio, Japan, the 23,824-ton ferry MV Princess of the Stars, {{formerly}} MV Ferry Lilac of Shin Nihonkai Ferry, {{had a total}} <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity</b> of 1,992 people.|$|E
25|$|Her speed under sail was 12 {{knots and}} under engine was 9 knots. Her <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity</b> {{was up to}} 80 {{passengers}} for short-term voyages and 36 passengers for overnight voyages. She had two two-passenger and eight four-passenger cabins.|$|E
25|$|Johor has one {{international}} airport, the Senai International Airport in Senai. It {{was opened}} on 6 June 1974 {{and has been}} expanded several times since. Currently, it has a 5-million <b>passenger</b> <b>capacity,</b> with a parallel taxiway under construction.|$|E
50|$|Peru {{already had}} two steamships on Lake Titicaca; Yavari and Yapura. Increasing traffic had outstripped their cargo and <b>passenger</b> <b>capacities</b> so the Peruvian Corporation, a UK-owned {{company that had}} taken over Perus {{railways}} and lake shipping in 1890, ordered a much larger ship to supplement them. Coya, at 546 tons and 170 ft long, was the largest steamship on Lake Titicaca when she was launched in 1893.|$|R
