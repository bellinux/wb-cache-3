40|$|The {{theory of}} {{acoustic}} plane waves incident on an oblique clamped panel in a rectangular duct was developed from basic theoretical concepts. The coupling theory between the elastic vibrations of the <b>panel</b> (<b>plate)</b> and the oblique incident acoustic plane wave in infinite space was considered in detail, {{and was used}} for the oblique clamped panel in the rectangular duct. The partial differential equation which governs the vibrations of the clamped <b>panel</b> (<b>plate)</b> was modified by adding to it stiffness (spring) forces and damping forces.

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{acoustic}} plane wave normally incident on a clamped panel in a rectangular duct is developed. The coupling theory between the elastic vibrations of the <b>panel</b> (<b>plate)</b> and the acoustic wave propagation in infinite space {{and in the}} rectangular duct is considered. The partial differential equation which governs the vibration of the <b>panel</b> (<b>plate)</b> is modified by adding to its stiffness (spring) forces and damping forces, and the fundamental resonance frequency and the attenuation factor are discussed. The noise reduction expression based on the theory is found to agree well with the corresponding experimental data of a sample aluminum panel in the mass controlled region, the damping controlled region, and the stiffness controlled region. All the frequency positions of the upward and downward resonance spikes in the sample experimental data are identified theoretically as resulting from four cross interacting major resonance phenomena: the cavity resonance, the acoustic resonance, the plate resonance, and the wooden back panel resonance...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Dynamic {{responses}} of linear viscoelastic flat <b>panels</b> (<b>plates)</b> un-der {{the influence of}} aerodynamic noise are formulated and examined. Three modes of potential failures are considered, namely panel flutter, creep buckling and material failure such as composite fiber delamination. Differential, inte-gral or proportional servo-controlers are added in order to stabilize the system and extend its lifetime. Parametric studies of servo-controllers led to no gen-eral conclusion because of the highly complicated phase relations. However, the simulations indicate that an increase in servo control parameters does not necessarily {{lead to an increase}} in flutter velocity.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of a {{nonlinear}} FE-Analysis of prestressed concrete structures the prestress forces can be appropriately described by work equivalent nodal forces. In this work a corresponding method is presented, which applies to different ways of idealization of structure, any element geometry and elements with arbitrary number of nodes. The geometric tendon course is approximated near to reality by an interpolating third degree spline-function irrespectively of the structure geometry, wereby all in engineering problems occuring tendon courses can be represented. To determine all elements affected by prestress automatically an algorithm is described, which is valid to all <b>panel,</b> <b>plate</b> and shell elements with arbitrary number of nodes. Starting from the principle of virtual displacements applied to the tendon course the discrete equilibrium equation is expanded by the vector of equivalent nodal forces and the vector of internal resisting forces caused by prestress.

40|$|In this paper, the {{stability}} of a simply supported axially moving elastic <b>panel</b> (<b>plate</b> undergoing cylindrical deformation) is considered. A complex variable technique and bifurcation theory are applied. As a result, variational equations and a variational principle are derived. Analysis of the variational principle allows the study of qualitative properties of the bifurcation points. Asymptotic behaviour in a small neighbourhood around an arbitrary bifurcation point is analyzed and presented. It is shown analytically that the eigenvalue curves in the (ω, V 0) plane cross both the ω and V 0 axes perpendicularly. It is also shown that near each bifurcation point, the dependence ω(V 0) for each mode approximately follows {{the shape of a}} square root near the origin. The obtained results complement existing numerical studies on {{the stability}} of axially moving materials, especially those with finite bending rigidity. From a rigorous mathematical viewpoint, the presence of bending rigidity is essential, because the presence of the fourth-order term in the model changes the qualitative behaviour of the bifurcation points. The results are applicable to both axially moving panels and axially moving beams...|$|R

40|$|A Blended Wing Body (BWB) {{configuration}} is {{an innovative}} aircraft concept that promises high aerodynamic efficiency compared to conventional aircraft. However, unlike conventional aircraft configurations with circular fuselage cross sections, the major structural design challenge with BWB is the wide non-circular fuselage centre section, {{where it has}} to withstand both internal cabin pressures and wing bending loads. Several solutions have been proposed for the structural design of the BWB centre section, such as Top Surface <b>Panel</b> <b>Plate</b> models, Multi-Bubble model and the Y-Braced Box Fuselage to minimise the weight penalty. However, they contain {{a large number of}} separated compartments which is not particularly suitable for a cargo transport that requires a large and contiguous cargo compartment to carry bulk payload.
