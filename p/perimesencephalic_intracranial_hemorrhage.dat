40|$|Patients {{with mild}} head injuries, a GCS of 13 – 15, {{are at risk}} for <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> Clinical {{decision}} is needed to weigh between risks of <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> and costs of the CT scan of the brain particularly those who are equivocal. This study aimed to find predictors for <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> in patients with mild head injuries with a moderate risk of <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> We defined moderate risk of mild head injury as a GCS score of 13 – 15 accompanied by at least one symptom such as headache, vomiting, or amnesia or with alcohol intoxication. There were 153 patients who met the study criteria. Eighteen of the patients (11. 76 %) had <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> There were four independent factors associated with intracranial hemorrhage: history of hypertension, headache, loss of consciousness, and baseline GCS. The sensitivity for the presence of <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> was 100 % with the cutoff point for the GCS of 13. In conclusion, the independent factors associated with <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> in patients with mild head injury who were determined to be at moderate risk for the condition included history of hypertension, headache, loss of consciousness, and baseline GCS score...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{determine}} whether preterm infants diagnosed with <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> (by transfontanellar ultrasound) at birth have cerebral lesions that are detectable by {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) upon reaching school age. Materials and Methods: MRI scans of the brain were obtained in 22 school-age children. Fifteen had presented <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> at birth, and seven had not. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) for the occurrence of brain alterations detectable by MRI and the kappa index for discrepancies among the radiological reports. Results: The children without previous <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> presented normal MRI findings. Of the 15 children with previous <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> 6 (40 %) presented brain alterations on MRI: isolated ventricular alteration (dilation and asymmetry), in 2 (13. 3 %); and ventricular asymmetry accompanied by parenchymal lesion, in 4 (26. 7 %). The nine remaining children with previous <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> (60 %) presented normal MRI findings. The children with previous <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> {{were more likely to}} present ventricular alteration (OR = 7. 8) and parenchymal lesions (OR = 5. 4). Conclusion: Ventricular and parenchymal brain alterations detected by MRI suggest isolated morphologic alterations that do not result in neurological impairment detectable on physical examination in school-age children...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose - We {{sought to}} report the {{occurrence}} and risk factors of <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> during long-term follow-up of patients with internal carotid artery stenosis, with and without carotid endarterectomy. Methods - From the prospective data of the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial, 3 types of <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> were recognized: Petechiae within infarction (PTI), intracerebral hematoma (ICH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The 30 -day and 5 -year risks of <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> (PTI or ICH) were estimated from Kaplan-Meier event-free survival curves. Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling was used to identify risk factors. Results - Of 1039 strokes that occurred in 749 of 2885 patients during an average follow-up of 5 years, there were 24 PTIs, 14 ICHs, and 1 SAH. The 5 -year risk of <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> was 1. 7 % in both medically and surgically treated patients, but the 30 -day risk of 0. 64 % in surgically treated patients was 10 {{times higher than the}} risk of 0. 07 % in medically treated patients (P= 0. 01). Approximately 50 % of all <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> were either disabling or fatal, and ICHs {{were more likely to be}} fatal than PTIs. Old age, a history of hypertension, intermittent claudication and smoking, and infarct on brain images were risk factors for <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> in medically treated patients, whereas diabetes mellitus was the sole risk factor in surgically treated patients. Conclusions - <b>Intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> are uncommon in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis but are associated with high mortality and morbidity.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{antithrombotic}} agents (warfarin, clopidogrel, ASA) on {{traumatic brain injury}} outcomes is highly controversial. Although cerebral atrophy is speculated as a risk for acute <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> there is no objective literature evidence. This is a retrospective, consecutive investigation of patients with signs of external head trauma and age ≥ 60 years. Outcomes were correlated with antithrombotic-agent status, coagulation test results, admission neurologic function, and CT-based cerebral atrophy dimensions. Of 198 consecutive patients, 36 % were antithrombotic-negative and 64 % antithrombotic-positive. ASA patients had higher arachidonic acid inhibition (p =  0. 04) and warfarin patients had higher INR (p< 0. 001), compared to antithrombotic-negative patients. Antithrombotic-positive <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> rate (38. 9 %) {{was similar to the}} antithrombotic-negative rate (31. 9 %; p =  0. 3285). Coagulopathy was not present on the ten standard coagulation, thromboelastography, and platelet mapping tests with <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> and results were similar to those without hemorrhage (p≥ 0. 1354). Hemorrhagic-neurologic complication (<b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> progression, need for craniotomy, neurologic deterioration, or death) rates were similar for antithrombotic-negative (6. 9 %) and antithrombotic-positive (8. 7 %; p =  0. 6574) patients. The hemorrhagic-neurologic complication rate was increased when admission major neurologic dysfunction was present (63. 2 % versus 2. 2 %; RR =  28. 3; p< 0. 001). Age correlated inversely with brain parenchymal width (p< 0. 001) and positively with lateral ventricular width (p =  0. 047) and cortical atrophy (p< 0. 001). <b>Intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> correlated with cortical atrophy (p< 0. 001) and ventricular width (p< 0. 001). <b>Intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> is not associated with antithrombotic agent use. <b>Intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> patients have no demonstrable coagulopathy. The association of preinjury brain atrophy with acute <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> is a novel finding.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Scarce {{data are}} {{available}} on the occurrence of symptomatic <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> related to intravenous thrombolysis for acute stroke in South America. We aimed to address the frequency and clinical predictors of symptomatic <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> after stroke thrombolysis at our tertiary emergency unit in Brazil. METHOD: We reviewed the clinical and radiological data of 117 consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis in our hospital between May 2001 and April 2010. We compared our results with those of the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke registry. Univariate and multiple regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with symptomatic intracranial transformation. RESULTS: In total, 113 cases from the initial sample were analyzed. The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 16 (interquartile range: 10 - 20). The median onset-to-treatment time was 188 minutes (interquartile range: 155 - 227). There were seven symptomatic <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> (6. 2 %; Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke registry: 4. 9 %; p = 0. 505). In the univariate analysis, current statin treatment and elevated National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores were related to symptomatic <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> After the multivariate analysis, current statin treatment was the only factor independently associated with symptomatic <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> CONCLUSIONS: In this series of Brazilian patients with severe strokes treated with intravenous thrombolysis in a public university hospital at a late treatment window, we found no increase in the rate of symptomatic <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> Additional studies are necessary to clarify the possible association between statins and the risk of symptomatic <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> after stroke thrombolysis...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—The optimum {{timing of}} {{resumption}} of anticoagulation after warfarin-related <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> {{in patients with}} indication for continued anticoagulation is uncertain.

Methods—We reviewed charts of 2869 consecutive patients with objectively verified <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> over 6 years at 3 tertiary centers. We calculated the daily risk of <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> or ischemic stroke with and without resumption of warfarin; we focused on patients who survived the first week and had cardiac indication for anticoagulation or previous stroke. Using a Cox model, we estimated rates for these 2 adverse events in relation to different time points of resumed anticoagulation. The combined risk of either a new <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> or an ischemic stroke was calculated {{for a range of}} warfarin resumption times. Results—We identified warfarin-associated <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> in 234 patients (8. 2 %), of whom 177 patients (76 %) survived the first week and had follow-up information available; the median follow-up time was 69 weeks (interquartile range [IQR] 19 – 144). Fifty-nine patients resumed warfarin after a median of 5. 6 weeks (IQR 2. 6 – 17). The hazard ratio for recurrent <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> with resumption of warfarin was 5. 6 (95 % CI, 1. 8 – 17. 2), and for ischemic stroke it was 0. 11 (95 % CI, 0. 014 – 0. 89).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{efficacy}} of thrombolytic therapy in reducing mortality from {{acute myocardial infarction}} has been unequivocally shown. However, thrombolysis is related to bleeding complications, including <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of and risk factors for <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> after recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) given for acute myocardial infarction in patients receiving usual care. DESIGN: Large national registry of patients who have had acute myocardial infarction. SETTING: 1484 U. S. hospitals. PATIENTS: 71073 patients who had had acute myocardial infarction from 1 June 1994 to 30 September 1996, received tPA as the initial reperfusion strategy, and did not receive a second dose of any thrombolytic agent. MEASUREMENT: <b>Intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> confirmed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: 673 patients (0. 95 %) {{were reported to have}} had <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> during hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction; 625 patients (0. 88 %) had the event confirmed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Of the 625 patients with confirmed <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> 331 (53 %) died during hospitalization. An additional 158 patients (25. 3 %) who survived to hospital discharge had residual neurologic deficit. In multivariable models for the main effects of candidate risk factors, older age, female sex, black ethnicity, systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more, diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or more, history of stroke, tPA dose more than 1. 5 mg/kg, and lower body weight were significantly associated with <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>Intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> is a rare but serious complication of tPA in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

In univariate analysis, male patients (p = 0. 002), patients with medical history of smoking (p< 0. 001) or alcohol consumption (p = 0. 022), and DAVFs located at the tentorium (p = 0. 010), frontalbasal (p = 0. 007), foramen magnum (p = 0. 043) or cerebral convexity (p< 0. 001) were associated with an increased risk of <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> A higher risk of hemorrhagic occurrence was also observed in DAVFs with superficial cortical venous drainage (p< 0. 001), deep venous drainage (p = 0. 003), occluded venous sinus (p< 0. 032), or higher Borden type (p< 0. 001). A multivariate logistic regression model showed that <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> in patients with DAVFs was correlated with higher Borden classification (OR 5. 880; 95 % CI, 3. 370 - 10. 257; p< 0. 001). Venous drainage pattern was the only independent risk factor of <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> in our patients with intracranial DAVF. The other potential risk factors may be confounding factors in predicting <b>intracranial</b> <b>hemorrhage...</b>|$|R
