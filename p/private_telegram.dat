2500|$|In April 1893, {{less than}} eight months after Robinson played in his last major league game, the Sporting Life {{newspaper}} reported that a <b>private</b> <b>telegram</b> said that Robinson was dying of consumption (pulmonary tuberculosis) and had been [...] "reduced to a mere skeleton, weighing {{in the neighborhood of}} ninety pounds." [...] He had reportedly signed a contract to play for Louisville in 1893, but traveled instead to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to receive treatment for his illness.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the Coronado mine attack, pro-union sheriff M. H. Newman telegraphed Governor McIntire asking for the {{immediate}} dispatch of the Colorado National Guard to prevent further violence. Pro-union judge Owers did likewise. With even the pro-union law enforcement officials of Lake County telling him that the situation was out of control, and that troops were needed, the governor had no choice. The first 230 guard troops arrived before nightfall on September 21, and by nightfall on September 22 there were 653 guardsmen protecting the mines from further attacks. Governor McIntire admonished Brigadier General E. J. Brooks in a <b>private</b> <b>telegram</b> to be impartial, not to take sides, and [...] "Protect all parties alike from violence." [...] But however impartial, the presence of guard troops was exactly what the mine owners wanted.|$|E
60|$|In {{answer to}} a <b>private</b> <b>telegram,</b> we learned {{that none of these}} was {{severely}} hurt, except Mr. Gray. Letters received afterward confirmed this news, and said that Mr. Gray was improving and would get well. Later letters spoke less hopefully of his case; and finally came one announcing his death. A good man, a most companionable and manly man, and worthy of a kindlier fate.|$|E
25|$|Millions of <b>private</b> <b>telegrams</b> sent from, to, {{or through}} the United States were {{obtained}} by the National Security Agency (NSA), under a secret arrangement with U.S. telegraph companies, from 1947 to 1975.|$|R
60|$|Not {{only were}} there {{those on the}} {{business}} of the Mica Company, but Mr. Darby, the storekeeper at Akeville, thought it necessary {{to send a message to}} Hetertown by the new line, and there were two or three other <b>private</b> <b>telegrams,</b> that would probably never have been sent had it not been for the novelty of the thing.|$|R
25|$|A radio {{direction}} finder {{of the kind}} then used by large passenger ships employed a rotatable loop antenna to determine the airship's position from any two land radio stations or ship-based transmitters from ships with known positions. During the airship's transatlantic flight to the United States in October 1928, the radio room sent 484 <b>private</b> <b>telegrams</b> and 160 press telegrams.|$|R
60|$|And Mr. Hamlin had none. And so, after a <b>private</b> <b>telegram,</b> Dr. Mackintosh arrived, and {{for three}} or four hours the two doctors talked in an {{apparently}} unintelligible language, chiefly about a person whom Mr. Hamlin was satisfied did not exist. And when Dr. Mackintosh left, Dr. Duchesne, after a very earnest conversation with him {{on their way to the}} stage office, drew a chair beside Mr. Hamlin's bed.|$|E

25|$|The Graf was {{outfitted}} {{with the most}} modern radio equipment then available. A staff of three radio operators communicated with ground stations and ships, performed radio navigation, received weather reports, and sent <b>private</b> <b>telegrams</b> for passengers. A one-kilowatt vacuum tube transmitter (about 140 watt antenna power) was used to send telegrams over the low frequency (500–3,000m) bands. A 70 watt antenna power emergency transmitter was available for both telegraph and radio telephone over 300–1,300m wavelength bands which could be powered by either batteries or the gasoline generator.|$|R
5|$|Homing pigeons {{were used}} {{extensively}} in the 19th and early 20thcenturies, both for civil pigeon post and as war pigeons. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the famous pigeon post of Paris carried up to 50,000microfilmed telegrams per pigeon flight from Tours into the besieged capital. Altogether 150,000 individual <b>private</b> <b>telegrams</b> and state dispatches were delivered. In an 1889 experiment of the Imperial Russian Technical Society at Saint Petersburg, {{the chief of the}} Russian balloon corps took aerial photographs from a balloon and sent the developed collodion film negatives to the ground by pigeon post.|$|R

60|$|This is the Honourable Hilary's public face.

And are there not queries--which history may disclose in after years--as to whether Mr. Crewe's abilities as a statesman have not been seriously underrated by those who should have been the first to perceive them? Verily, pride goeth before a fall.|$|R

25|$|High {{frequency}} (HF) {{services were}} introduced in 1927, allowing messages to penetrate globally. The most important use was reaching fishing vessels in the Antarctic and increased the use of <b>private</b> <b>telegrams</b> by seamen. Implementation was slow: by 1935 HF transmitters had been installed on about 100 Norwegian ships, and 450 ships by 1940. Wireless telephony was introduced at Bergen Radio in 1931 and by 1939 the service covered the entire coast. In 1940 there were 70 communities which had their telephone network connected to the national network by wireless transmission. From 1927 new spark-gap transmitters over 300watts were not permitted and all such transmitters had to be phased out by 1940. Implementation of vacuum tube transmitters was slow: by 1937, 600 of 1000 Norwegian ships with a ship radio still had spark-gap transmitters. The coast stations all received vacuum tube transmitters by 1935.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the inquiry}} Wood {{presented}} {{copies of a}} series of coded telegrams written by Overheu. Nairn objected to Wood making <b>private</b> <b>telegrams</b> public but Wood overruled him as they [...] "show that one member of the police party interested himself considerably in getting the defence worked up". The telegrams revealed a network of communication between the [...] "interested parties", local fund raising for the defence that had raised more than ₤1,000 ($68,000 in 2009 dollars) and detailed the [...] "conspiracy" [...] of Gribble organising the killing of Nulla Nulla cattle by mission Aboriginals, giving details of how it was done that Wood found barely credible. More to the point, the telegrams revealed Overheu's hatred of Aborigines, a view supported by a statement to Detective Sergeant Manning by Lyddie, that it was Overhue who continually urged the police to kill the prisoners.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first run}} of the Pony Express was {{scheduled}} for April 3, 1860. The mail pouch bound for the west, carrying [...] "49 letters, 5 <b>private</b> <b>telegrams,</b> and some papers for San Francisco and intermediate points", had missed a train connection and the superintendent of the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad had to order a special locomotive dispatched to deliver the pouch to St. Joseph. The mail arrived two hours late and, {{after a number of}} speeches were recited, set off for Sacramento. It took seventy-five ponies to make the first trip from Missouri to California. Each major city along the way celebrated as the Pony Express rider passed through. On April 14, 1860, at about 1 a.m., the Pony Express from St. Joseph arrived in San Francisco. The east-bound rider left San Francisco April 3 and made it to St. Josephs on April 13. The Pony Express was active.|$|R

50|$|In telecommunication, a {{commercial}} code is a code once used {{to save on}} cablegram costs. Telegraph (and telex) charged per word sent, so companies which sent large volumes of telegrams developed codes to save money on tolls. Elaborate commercial codes which encoded complete phrases into single words were developed and published as codebooks of thousands of phrases and sentences with corresponding codewords. Commercial codes were not generally intended to keep <b>telegrams</b> <b>private,</b> as codes were widely published; they were usually cost-saving measures only.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1937, Leipziger {{completed}} a utopian science fiction novel, mostly in German, entitled La Grande Compagnie de Colonisation: Dokumente eines Grossen Planes. It was published under the pseudonym [...] "Tom Palmer" [...] by the hitherto unknown publisher Malpartes-Verlag Evy Friedrich of Luxembourg. Written {{in the form}} of a collection of fictional meeting minutes, press releases, <b>private</b> letters, <b>telegrams</b> and newspaper clippings, the book tells the story of a corporation based in Luxembourg, chartered with the purpose of developing all unused and unpopulated regions in the world. The company eventually succeeds in its goal, overcoming various forms of nationalist opposition to accomplish massive works: irrigating deserts, closing the Straits of Gibraltar and the Bosporus, building a canal through Nicaragua, tunneling under the English Channel, developing the mineral resources of South America and creating arable land in China. Contemporary reviewers of the work detected the influence of the murdered German industrialist Walther Rathenau, who had published his own utopian vision Was wird werden in 1920.|$|R
5000|$|On 21 February 1967, {{an article}} in the Daily Express written by Chapman Pincher claimed that [...] "thousands of <b>private</b> cables and <b>telegrams</b> sent out of Britain from the Post Office or from {{commercial}} cable companies are regularly being made available to the security authorities for scrutiny". According to the memoirs of Harold Wilson, who claimed that there were many inaccuracies in it, the story had come [...] "from a disgruntled ex-employee of a cable company". The legal position at the time was that a warrant was needed under section 4 of the Official Secrets Act 1920, similar to that needed to intercept mail.|$|R
