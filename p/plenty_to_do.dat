500|$|Crash of the Titans {{received}} mixed {{to average}} reviews upon its release. GameSpot credited it as a [...] "fairly sturdy, combat-heavy platformer {{with a good}} hook", but concluded that it lacked the distinctive style of past Crash Bandicoot games. The DS version of the game was reviewed positively, with IGN naming it [...] "one of the better handheld Crash games to hit the market". Nintendo World Report gave the DS version a higher score than the home console version by half a point, but dismissed it as [...] "a short game that has very little gameplay variety". GameSpot proclaimed that [...] "there's <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and controlling the enemy is a neat twist", but criticized the game's small length of only six to eight hours.|$|E
500|$|In Leipzig, Bache studied piano with Ignaz Moscheles and {{composition}} with Carl Reinecke. He also {{became friends with}} a fellow student, Arthur Sullivan, who, he wrote, [...] "cannot play well, but ... has written some things which I think show great talent." [...] Another fellow student Bache knew well, though they were not especially close, was Edvard Grieg. While the city was reportedly past the halcyon days it had experienced under Mendelssohn, it proved valuable for exposing Bache to artists such as Pauline Viardot, Giulia Grisi, Joseph Joachim and Henri Vieuxtemps, and {{to the music of}} Beethoven, Bellini, Chopin, Moritz Hauptmann and Mendelssohn. He applied himself to his piano studies, but by his own admission wasted much time in Leipzig and lacked direction. In Brother Musicians, Constance quotes [...] "a musician of high standing" [...] who was one of his circle of friends (possibly Sullivan or the pianist Franklin Taylor), who explained, [...] "You see in Leipzig nobody was compelled to work, there being no particular supervision; and there was always <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> in the way of amusement, for the less energetic. As far as my recollection goes Bache was at that time rather given to working by fits and starts, frequently making excellent resolutions, the effect of which did not last many days." ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the year, Friedgen had {{challenged}} {{his players}} {{with the phrase}} [...] "Are you in or are you out?"
