Al-though most investigators {{believe that this}} increase in pressure reflects a vasoconstriction in the pul-monary vascular bed, the site of vasoconstriction, whether venular, capillary, or arteriolar, is con-troversial. Interpretations have been based previ-ously upon measurements of pressure and flow at various sites in the pulmonary circulation and have been handicapped by the inability to measure the volumes of the segments under study (1 - 3). The development of an ether plethysmographic technique to measure pulmonary arterial blood vol-ume in vivo (4) prompted us to reassess the site of vasoconstriction produced by hypoxia or sero-tonin. To accomplish this, we used cardiac cath-eters to measure pulmonary arterial and left atrial <b>pressures,</b> <b>dye</b> dilution curves to measure pulmo-nary blood volume and cardiac output, and the ether plethysmographic method to calculate pul-monary arterial blood volume. These parameters were measured in dogs during 1) a control pe-riod, and then during 2) respiration of a low con-centration of oxygen, or 3) slow intravenous infu-sion of a solution of 5 -hydroxytryptamine. We shall attempt to show that alveolar hypoxia and 5 -hydroxytryptamine produced a form of pulmo-nary vasoconstriction {{in which there was}} increased smooth muscle tone of a major portion of the pul-monary arterial tree. * Submitted for publication June 23, 1965; accepte...|$|R

5000|$|The dye-sublimation {{printing}} process {{is used to}} print on polyester or other synthetic fabrics. It is used for applications such as T-shirts, banners, table covers, id cards, sportswear and flags. The original printers were an electrostatic technology using toners but now are generally large format inkjet printers using specially formulated inks. The dye sublimation inks are a disperse dye suspended in a liquid solvent, like water. The images are initially printed on coated heat-resistant transfer paper as a reverse image of the final design, which is then transferred onto polyester fabric in a heat press operating at a temperature around 180 to 210 C (375 F). Under high temperature and <b>pressure,</b> the <b>dye</b> turns into a gas and permeates the fabric and then solidifies into its fibers. The fabric is permanently dyed {{so it can be}} washed without damaging the quality of the image. Shelfies and Blue Notes are two such companies that use this method.|$|R

Bahan pewarna merupakan senyawa komplek dan relatif stabil sehingga sulit ditangani. Proses oksidasi lanjut telah terbukti mampu menurunkan kadar bahan pewarna dalam air limbah. Penelitian ini mempelajari potensi air limbah pemucatan untuk menurunkan kadar bahan pewama dalam air limbah pewarnaan. Proses pencampuran air limbah pewarna dengan air limbah pemucatan dilakukan di dalam sebuah reaktor batch yang dilengkapi empat lampu UV masing-masing 10 Watt dan sebuah pengaduk magnit. Penurunan kadar zat warna dinyatakan dalam Kebutuhan Oksigen Kimiawi (KOK). Setiap jangka (interval) waktu tertentu, cuplikan air limbah sebanyak 2 mL diambil dari reaktor lalu dianalisis KOK nya. Rasio volume limbah pewarnaan terhadap limbah pemucatan adalah 3 : 1, 2 : 1, 1 : 1, 1 : 2, dan 1 : 3. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa semakin kecil nisbah limbah pewamaan dengan limbah pemucatan menghasilkan penurunan KOK semakin besar. Dengan volume limbah total 150 m, potensi oksidasi limbah pemucatan setara dengan sekitar 2 mL hidrogen peroksida 50 % dalam 150 mL air limbah. ABSTRACT Traditional weaving {{activities}} in Gamplong produce wastewater, mainly from dyeing and bleaching processes. Dyes are complex compounds and realtively stable which {{is difficult to}} be managed. Advanced oxidation processes {{have proved to be}} able to decrease dyes content in the wastewater. The aim of this experiment is to study the potency of bleaching wastewater to reduce dyes content in dyeing wastewater.  The mixing process of those wastewater was conducted in a batch reactor which was equipped with 4 UV light of 10 W each and a magnetic stirrer. The mixing process was performed at ambient temperature and <b>pressure.</b> <b>Dyes</b> content in the wastewater was expressed in chemical oxygen demand (COD). Each run, total volume of wastewater of dyeing process or  mixtures of dyeing process and bleaching process were 150 mL. At a certain time interval, 2 mL of treated wastewater was sucked up from the reactor, and then its COD content was analysed. The volume ratios of dyeing wastewater to bleaching wastewater investigated were 3 : 1, 2 : 1, 1 : 1, 1 : 2, and 1 : 3. The experiment results showed that the COD conversion increases with the decreases of the ratio of dyeing wastewater to bleaching wastewater.

30|$|The highly {{crystalline}} structure {{and a lack}} of polarity make polyester fiber hydrophobic in nature (El-Nagar et al. 2006) that in turn resists any entry of water molecules into the polymer system and also imparts a limited swelling in water. Consequently, the hydrophobicity of polyester fiber restricts the diffusion of dye molecules into the fiber interior during dyeing (Peters and Ingamells 1973) that also makes the dyeing process exceedingly difficult at a low temperature. At a high temperature and <b>pressure,</b> the <b>dyeing</b> of polyester fiber is mainly carried out by synthetic colorants such as disperse dye (Aspland 1992; Fité 1995; Kim et al. 2005) owing to its very small particle size and non-ionic nature (Gohl and Vilensky 1983). However, in recent years there has been a renewed interest both in academia and textile industry due to mounting global awareness and environmental concerns that lead to several studies focusing on coloration of polyester fibers with natural dyes from various natural resources such as onion, madder, saffron, kola nut, dolu and curcumin (Ado et al. 2015; Shahin et al. 2014; El-Nagar et al. 2014). But still, any systematic investigation and application of henna dye on polyester fiber is rare despite its well-established use as a dye for textile fibers.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{studying}} the volatilisation rate of materials using a conventional thermobalance and standard sample holders is described. This was used to study two dyes; CI Disperse Yellow 54 and CI Disperse Red 60. Using pure reference materials, a relationship between volatilisation rate and vapour pressure based on the Langmuir equation for free evaporation was used to calibrate the system. Thus, the vapour <b>pressures</b> of the <b>dyes</b> could be determined. Heats of sublimation and vaporisation were calculated from a plot of the logarithm of the vapour pressure against reciprocal absolute temperature. Extrapolation of the vapour pressure vs. temperature curve outside the experimentally measured region for Red 60 was made using the melting point and heat of fusion found by DSC. Good agreement was found with literature data. In favourable cases, the melting temperature and heat of fusion can be obtained directly from thermogravimetry. # 1998 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} of computationally simulating intracoronary blood flow based on real coronary artery geometry and to graphically depict various mechanical characteristics of this flow. Methods: Explanted fresh pig hearts were fixed using a continuous perfusion of 4 % formaldehyde at physiological <b>pressures.</b> Omnipaque <b>dye</b> added to lead rubber solution was titrated to an optimum proportion of 1 : 25, to cast the coronary arterial tree. The heart was stabilized in a phantom model so as to suspend the base and the apex without causing external deformation. High resolution computerized tomography scans of this model were utilized to reconstruct the three-dimensional coronary artery geometry, which in turn was used to generate several volumetric tetrahedral meshes of sufficient density needed for numerical accuracy. The transient equations of momentum and mass conservation were numerically solved by employing methods of computational fluid dynamics under realistic pulsatile inflow boundary conditions. Results: The simulations have yielded graphic distributions of intracoronary flow stream lines, static pressure drop, wall shear stress, bifurcation mass flow ratios and velocity profiles. The variability of these quantities within the cardiac cycle has been investigated at a temporal resolution of 1 / 100 th of a second and a spatial resolution of about 10 mm. The areas of amplified variations in wall shear stress, mostly evident in the neighborhoods of arterial branching, seem to correlate well with clinically observed increased atherogenesis. The intracoronary flow lines showed stasis and extreme vorticity during the phase of minimum coronary flow in contrast to streamlined undisturbed flow during the phase of maximum flow.

40|$|Objective. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of the moment when reduced pressure is applied on dye penetration patterns. Study design. Nine hundred and sixty glass capillary tubes of different inner diameter (0. 3 mm and 0. 8 mm), divided into 48 groups, were submerged into dye in 3 different positions (horizontally, opening upwards, and opening downwards) under different vacuum conditions (passive, 5 kPa, 35 kPa, 70 kPa reduced pressure). When reduced pressure was applied half of the groups were submerged into dye before and half of the groups after the application of reduced <b>pressure.</b> Linear <b>dye</b> penetration was measured. Univariate analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test to select variables to be included in the regression model. A multiple logistic regression analysis with backward elimination was performed to assess the influence of different covariates on linear dye penetration. Results. The multivariate linear regression showed that the moment of vacuuming had the greatest positive effect on linear dye penetration value (beta = 10. 6, P <. 0001). Also the level of pressure reduction had a positive effect on the outcome variable (P = 0. 2, P <. 0001) while the vertical positioning of the tubes has negatively affected the outcome variable both for the open end upside (beta = - 1. 01, P =. 024) and the open end downside (beta = - 1. 05, P =. 019). Diameter of the tubes (P =. 442) and immersion time (P =. 727) had no effect on the outcome of linear dye penetration. Conclusions.

40|$|Two-photon calcium imaging is a {{powerful}} means for monitoring the activity of distinct neurons in brain tissue in vivo. In the mammalian brain, such imaging studies have been restricted largely to calcium recordings from neurons that were individually dye-loaded through microelectrodes. Previous attempts to use membrane-permeant forms of fluorometric calcium indicators to load populations of neurons have yielded satisfactory results only in cell cultures or in slices of immature brain tissue. Here we introduce a versatile approach for loading membrane-permeant fluorescent indicator dyes in large populations of cells.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Kaplan-type {{turbines}} with short, converging intakes are in widespread use, neither of the two test codes most commonly used in North America [1, 2] provide a practical method for measuring flow rate {{in this type of}} unit. Code-accepted flow rate measurement methods generally require relatively long sections of uniform penstock or a well-formed bellmouth inlet, which rarely exist with low-head Kaplan units. This paper describes the execution and results of an ASME and CEATI-sponsored test comparing methods for flow rate measurement suitable for use in the short converging intakes which are typical of low-head hydro plants. Three flow rate measurement technologies were evaluated – acoustic transit time, current meters, and acoustic scintillation. The former was installed in a non-uniform transition section, and the latter two in an intake gate slot. An existing code-accepted acoustic flowmeter in the penstock served as a “reference” measurement. The test was executed at the level of accuracy required for turbine acceptance testing, generally in accordance with ASME PTC 18 [1]. Furthermore it was conducted “blindly”, meaning the flow rate data was not shared among test participants during testing. The testing is described and the results of the comparison measurements are presented, including a statistical analysis that compares the intake method flow rate measurements with the reference meter at the 95 % confidence level. A comparison is also made with the results of flow rate comparison tests sponsored by EPRI at Kootenay Canal in 1983 [3]. That test included only methodologies inside the penstock, including acoustic transit time, current meter, salt velocity, <b>pressure</b> time, and <b>dye</b> dilution. Because the same acoustic transit time flowmeter section was used for both tests, the results for all methods are directly comparable. In addition to the intake flow rate measurement methods, a CFD model of the intake flow field was implemented, and comparison of the CFD model with the field measurements is briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Copper vapour laser (CVL) pumped high {{repetition}} rate narrow bandwidth dye laser {{is an important}} source of tunable radiation. It finds numerous applications in spectroscopic investigations and selective material processing like atomic vapour laser isotope separation (AVLIS). Being wavelength selective in these applications stability of the output wavelength and bandwidth are extremely important. The stability of these parameters depend upon the refractive index fluctuation of the dye medium, due to pump beam induced temperature gradients, dye solution flow, and mechanical stability of optical components. Precise measurement of wavelength and bandwidth of a dye laser and control over parameters governing the variations are important for any stable dye laser system. In this thesis, details of investigations carried out on a Rhodamine 6 G dye laser for obtaining stable wavelength and output power are presented. Parameters that affect the stability were identified, monitored and put on close loop control to achieve the desired stability. Pump beam i. e. CVL optical power, dye flow rate and dye solution temperature are mainly these parameters. CVL power is mainly a function of input electrical power and pressure of the buffer gas inside the tube. To monitor and regulate these parameters, different sensors and actuators were selected and interfaced with a master slave topology based data acquisition and control system. The DAQ and control system is designed around a micro controller card based on advanced CPU P 80552 and has on chip 8 channel 10 bit multiplexed analog input, 16 TTL digital inputs and 16 digital outputs. It works as slave and PC as master. Following closed loops were designed and incorporated to maintain a stable output: a. Average output of CVL was maintained constant by regulating the electric input power through closed loop control. b. The buffer gas pressure was monitored with a semiconductor pressure sensor and was regulated using pulse width modulation. c. Temperature of the dye solution was monitored with PT 100 and was controlled using proportional controller. d. Flow rate of dye solution was controlled using a variable frequency drive (VFD) for the dye circulation pump. e. The dye laser wavelength was monitored by using a high resolution spectrograph and pixel position of the peak from CCD image obtained from spectrograph is used for feedback correction using a pico motor. In the present work with application of the above-mentioned input power and pressure loops, a stable output of CVL, is achieved. Variations in power and pulse width of CVL are got limited to within 2 %, from 10 % when CVL system was working unregulated. This control system does the line regulations and corrects the input electrical power if variations in discharge current occur due to <b>pressure</b> variation. Every <b>dye</b> cell has limits on flow rate because of its geometry. With flow and temperature control dye cell was characterized to work with lower linewidth. VFD (variable frequency drive) is used for flow regulation. Finally active control on set wavelength was also achieved with resolution of 0. 01 nm accuracy. Measurement of wavelength was done with 0. 3 m, 0. 054 nm resolution spectrograph. Closed loop pico motor with 30 nm per step linear resolution was used for wavelength control.

First chapter presents a brief introduction to high {{repetition rate}} CVL pumped dye laser, operation of a CVL and parameters affecting the dye laser stability and their control schemes. Literature survey in this chapter is focused on different control mechanisms used with such lasers. Second chapter describes the laser system and interfacing of data acquisition system used for experimental setup. Closed loop controls for different parameters are described in this chapter. It also describes the software algorithms developed for this work. Third chapter presents experimental results and analysis with discussion on performance of the control loops.
