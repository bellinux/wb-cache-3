This paper documents that the post-earnings-announcement drift occurs mainly in the highly illiquid stocks. A trading strategy that goes long the high earnings surprise stocks and short the low earnings surprise stocks provides a return of 0. 23 % in the most liquid stocks and 1. 81 % per month in the most illiquid stocks. The illiquid stocks have high trading costs and market impact costs.

40|$|Abstract: The {{process of}} {{globalization}} {{has an important}} impact on national tax policies. Most of the literature does not focus directly on the political decision making process and assumes that the desired tax policy is responding to objective underlying tradeoffs. Based on an original survey of members of German national parliament (Bundestag) in 2006 / 7 we document a strong ideological bias among policy makers {{with respect to the}} perceived mobility of international tax bases (real capital and <b>paper</b> <b>profits).</b> Ideology influences also directly and indirectly the perceived national autonomy in tax setting and preferences for a EU minimum tax for companies. There seems little consensus as to what the efficiency costs of capital taxation in open economies are, even though our survey falls in a period of extensive debate about and actual adoption of a company tax reform bill in Germany. ...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{nature of}} the price {{information}} transfer when stock and futures markets switch between different price trading phases is examined. This is undertaken by decomposing Australian stock indexes and share price index futures contract data into bear- and bull-market phases and analyzing {{the change in the}} power of the bidirectional information feedback between the futures market and small, medium, and large stocks. Results support the hypothesis that the {{nature of the}} price-discovery process varies with the trading phase. In particular, during the bull phase small stocks show a marked increase in price exogeneity and futures prices contain relatively less price-sensitive fundamental information. We argue that in bull phases, futures trading becomes increasingly associated with noninformation trading such as realizing <b>paper</b> <b>profits,</b> portfolio rebalancing, and increased noise trading. 2003 The Southern Finance Association and the Southwestern Finance Association. ...|$|R

50|$|With {{that out}} of the way, here's how basic {{earnings}} and gains/losses work on a mutual fund. The fund records income for dividends and interest earned which typically increases the value of the mutual fund shares, while expenses set aside have an offsetting impact to share value. When the fund's investments increase (decrease) in market value, so too the fund shares value increases (or decreases). When the fund sells investments at a profit, it turns or reclassifies that <b>paper</b> <b>profit</b> or unrealized gain into an actual or realized gain. The sale has no effect on the value of fund shares but it has reclassified a component of its value from one bucket to another on the fund books—which will have future impact to investors. At least annually, a fund usually pays dividends from its net income (income less expenses) and net capital gains realized out to shareholders as an IRS requirement. This way, the fund pays no taxes but rather all the investors in taxable accounts do. Mutual fund share prices are typically valued each day the stock or bond markets are open and typically the value of a share is the net asset value of the fund shares investors own.|$|E

The sampled companies posted the highest profit using the FIFO method when compared with other methods(LIFO and WAC). The conclusion was that companies in Nigeria report ‘paper profit’…It was recommended that, the Nigerian Statement of Accounting Standard(SAS) No. 4 on Stock should be reviewed and recommend the use of LIFO method just as in most developed countries like United States of America to forestall the reporting of <b>paper</b> <b>profit</b> in Nigeria.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the success of}} bets on Australian Football League (AFL) matches made by identifying panels of highly proficient forecasters and betting {{on the basis of}} their pooled opinions. The data set is unusual, in that all forecasts are in the form of probabilities. Bets are made "on paper"Â against quoted market betting odds according to the (fractional) Kelly criterion. To identify expertise, individual forecasters are scored using conventional probability scoring rules, a "Kelly score"Â representing the forecaster's historical <b>paper</b> <b>profits</b> from Kelly-betting, and the more simplistic "categorical score"Â (number of misclassifications). Despite implicitly truncating all probabilities to either 0 or 1 before evaluation, and thus losing a lot of information, the categorical scoring rule appears to be a propitious way of ranking probability forecasters.

2500|$|One {{variant of}} selling short {{involves}} a long position. [...] "Selling short against the box" [...] consists of holding a long position {{on which the}} shares have already risen, whereupon one then enters a short sell order for {{an equal number of}} shares. The term box alludes to the days when a safe deposit box was used to store (long) shares. [...] The purpose of this technique is to lock in <b>paper</b> <b>profits</b> on the long position without having to sell that position (and possibly incur taxes if said position has appreciated). Once the short position has been entered, it serves to balance the long position taken earlier. Thus, from that point in time, the profit is locked in (less brokerage fees and short financing costs), regardless of further fluctuations in the underlying share price. For example, one can ensure a profit in this way, while delaying sale until the subsequent tax year.|$|R
