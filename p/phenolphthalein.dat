25|$|In several sources, the {{structure}} of phenol red is shown with the sulfur atom {{being part of a}} cyclic group, similar to {{the structure}} of <b>phenolphthalein.</b> However, this cyclic structure could not be confirmed by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} testing a {{structure}} for carbonatation is to drill a fresh hole in the surface and then treat the cut surface with <b>phenolphthalein</b> indicator solution. This solution turns pink when in contact with alkaline concrete, {{making it possible to}} see the depth of carbonation. Using an existing hole does not suffice because the exposed surface will already be carbonated.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{indicators}} share {{a similar}} structure to phenol red, including bromothymol blue, thymol blue, bromocresol purple, thymolphthalein, and <b>phenolphthalein.</b> (A table of other common chemical indicators {{is available in}} the article on pH indicators.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the history}} of wine, winemakers would use the sugar and acid levels of the grape as a guide in {{determining}} ripeness. Early winemakers tasted the grapes to gauge ripeness. Modern winemakers use a refractometer to measure hi [...] sugar levels and °Brix or titration tests (using an indicator such as <b>phenolphthalein)</b> to determine the titratable acidity within the grape.|$|E
2500|$|The major {{acids in}} wine are tartaric and malic acid with citric and succinic acids playing a small role. The titratable acidity or [...] "TA" [...] (also {{referred}} to as [...] "total acidity") is {{the measure of the}} tartaric acid in the grapes. This is the most abundant acid and also the one acid that has the most pronounced and long lasting impact on the taste of the wine. The TA is often measured by neutralizing some grape juice with a standard alkaline solution (such as sodium hydroxide) and then using an indicator (such as <b>phenolphthalein)</b> which changes color depending on the acid levels of the solution. The indicator is added to the grape juice followed by incremental amounts of the alkaline solution as the wine changes color until adding more of the solution ceases to promote a color change. At this point the wine has been neutralized with the amount of the alkaline solution needed to neutralize calculated in a formula to give an indication of how much tartaric acid was in the wine. The TA level is then expressed in a percentage of grams per 100 milliliter. As with must weight, the ideal levels for ripeness will vary according to wine style and winemaking preference. For still table wines, TA levels often fall between 0.60-0.80% for red wine grapes and 0.65-0.85 for whites.|$|E
50|$|The <b>phenolphthalein</b> used in {{this test}} has been {{modified}} from its conventional form, in {{that it has been}} reduced by two electrons and is pre-dissolved in alkaline solution. This is typically achieved by boiling an alkaline solution of <b>phenolphthalein</b> with powdered zinc, which reduces the <b>phenolphthalein</b> into phenolphthalin. Upon reduction, the very intense pink color of the cationic form of <b>phenolphthalein</b> fades to a faint yellow color. It is this form of <b>phenolphthalein</b> that is present in Kastle-Meyer test kits. In order to generate the intense pink color indicative of a positive test, the reduced <b>phenolphthalein</b> must be oxidized back to its normal, colored form.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenolphthalein</b> is {{slightly}} {{soluble in water}} and usually is dissolved in alcohols for use in experiments. It is a weak acid, which can lose H+ ions in solution. The <b>phenolphthalein</b> molecule is colorless, and the <b>phenolphthalein</b> ion is pink. When a base {{is added to the}} <b>phenolphthalein,</b> the molecule ⇌ ions equilibrium shifts to the right, leading to more ionization as H+ ions are removed. This is predicted by Le Chatelier's principle.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phenolphthalein</b> is a {{chemical}} compound with the formula C20H14O4 {{and is often}} written as [...] "HIn" [...] or [...] "phph" [...] in shorthand notation. <b>Phenolphthalein</b> is often used as an indicator in acid-base titrations. For this application, it turns colorless in acidic solutions and pink in basic solutions.|$|E
50|$|Quantification with PBA can be {{achieved}} by measuring intensity of the red color from <b>phenolphthalein</b> because brighter red emerges when the sample contains higher concentration of target antigens. For instance, if more antigens are bound to the surface antibodies, more eosin-conjugated antibodies will also bind to the bound analytes. Thus, photopolymerization on the surface becomes much faster and forms a thicker hydrogel film in which <b>phenolphthalein</b> molecules are trapped. Since more <b>phenolphthalein</b> molecules can remain in the thicker film after further rinsing, the indicators can give a higher intensity of red.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{concerns}} regarding its carcinogenicity, {{the use of}} <b>phenolphthalein</b> as a laxative is unlikely to cause ovarian cancer. <b>Phenolphthalein</b> {{has been found to}} inhibit human cellular calcium influx via store-operated calcium entry (SOCE, see [...] ). This is effected by its inhibiting thrombin and thapsigargin, two activators of SOCE that increase intracellular free calcium.|$|E

50|$|The Kastle-Meyer test is a {{presumptive}} blood test, {{first described}} in 1903, {{in which the}} chemical indicator <b>phenolphthalein</b> is used to detect the possible presence of hemoglobin. It relies on the peroxidase-like activity of hemoglobin in blood to catalyze the oxidation of phenolphthalin (the colorless reduced form of <b>phenolphthalein)</b> into <b>phenolphthalein,</b> which is visible as a bright pink color. The Kastle-Meyer test {{is a form of}} catalytic blood test, one of the two main classes of forensic tests commonly employed by crime labs in the chemical identification of blood. The other class of tests used for this purpose are microcrystal tests, such as the Taichmann crystal test and the Takayama crystal test.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{indicators}} share {{a similar}} structure to phenol red, including bromothymol blue, thymol blue, bromocresol purple, thymolphthalein, and <b>phenolphthalein.</b> (A table of other common chemical indicators {{is available in}} the article on pH indicators.) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenolphthalein</b> {{has been}} used for over a century as a laxative, but is now being removed from {{over-the-counter}} laxatives because of concerns over carcinogenicity. Thymolphthalein is a related laxative made from thymol. See Phenolsulfonphthalein also.|$|E
50|$|When a {{weak acid}} is titrated {{with a strong}} base the {{end-point}} occurs at pH greater than 7. Therefore, the most suitable indicator to use is one, like <b>phenolphthalein,</b> that changes color at high pH.|$|E
50|$|Phenolphthalein's pH {{sensitivity}} is exploited {{in other}} applications: Concrete has naturally high pH {{due to the}} calcium hydroxide formed when Portland cement reacts with water. As the concrete reacts with {{carbon dioxide in the}} atmosphere, pH decreases to 8.5-9. When a 1% <b>phenolphthalein</b> solution is applied to normal concrete, it turns bright pink. However, if it remains colorless, it shows that the concrete has undergone carbonation. In a similar application, spackling used to repair holes in drywall contains <b>phenolphthalein.</b> When applied, the basic spackling material retains a pink coloration; when the spackling has cured by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide, the pink color fades.|$|E

5000|$|Color {{indicating}} titration: An appropriate pH {{color indicator}} e.g. <b>phenolphthalein,</b> is used. Titrant {{is added to}} the sample by means of a burette. The volume of titrant used to cause a permanent color change in the sample is recorded and used to calculate the TAN value.|$|E
50|$|Alkalinity is {{sometimes}} incorrectly used interchangeably with basicity. For example, the pH {{of a solution}} can be lowered {{by the addition of}} CO2. This will reduce the basicity; however, the alkalinity will remain unchanged (see example below).For total alkalinity testing N/10 H2SO4 is used along with <b>phenolphthalein</b> indicator.|$|E
50|$|Indicator: A {{substance}} that changes color {{in response to}} a chemical change. An acid-base indicator (e.g., <b>phenolphthalein)</b> changes color depending on the pH.
