25|$|Henry Miller {{assumed a}} unique place in American Literature in the 1930s when his semi-autobiographical novels, written and {{published}} in Paris, were banned from the US. Although his major works, including Tropic of Cancer and Black Spring, would not {{be free of the}} label of obscenity until 1962, their themes and stylistic innovations had already exerted a major influence on succeeding generations of American writers, and paved the way for sexually frank 1960s novels by John Updike, <b>Philip</b> <b>Roth,</b> Gore Vidal, John Rechy and William Styron.|$|E
25|$|Promiscuities {{reports on}} and {{analyzes}} the shifting patterns of contemporary adolescent sexuality. Wolf argues that literature {{is rife with}} examples of male coming-of-age stories, covered autobiographically by D. H. Lawrence, Tobias Wolff, J. D. Salinger, and Ernest Hemingway, and covered misogynistically by Henry Miller, <b>Philip</b> <b>Roth,</b> and Norman Mailer. Wolf insists, however, that female accounts of adolescent sexuality have been systematically suppressed. She adduces cross-cultural material to demonstrate that women have, across history, been celebrated as more carnal than men. Wolf also argues that women must reclaim the legitimacy of their own sexuality by shattering the polarization of women between virgin and whore.|$|E

25|$|Don DeLillo, {{who rose}} to {{literary}} prominence {{with the publication}} of his 1985 novel, White Noise, a work broaching the subjects of death and consumerism and doubling as a piece of comic social criticism, began his writing career in 1971 with Americana. He is listed by Harold Bloom as being among the preeminent contemporary American writers, in the company of such figures as <b>Philip</b> <b>Roth,</b> Cormac McCarthy, and Thomas Pynchon. His 1997 novel Underworld chronicles American life through and immediately after the Cold War and is usually considered his masterpiece. It was also the runner-up in a survey that asked writers to identify the most important work of fiction of the last 25 years. Among his other important novels are Libra (1988), Mao II (1991) and Falling Man (2007).|$|E
25|$|Frequently {{linked with}} Updike is the novelist <b>Philip</b> <b>Roth.</b> Roth vigorously explores Jewish {{identity}} in American society, {{especially in the}} postwar era and the early 21st century. Frequently set in Newark, New Jersey, Roth's work {{is known to be}} highly autobiographical, and many of Roth's main characters, most famously the Jewish novelist Nathan Zuckerman, are thought to be alter egos of Roth. With these techniques, and armed with his articulate and fast-paced style, Roth explores the distinction between reality and fiction in literature while provocatively examining American culture. His most famous work includes the Zuckerman novels, the controversial Portnoy's Complaint (1969), and Goodbye, Columbus (1959). Among the most decorated American writers of his generation, he has won every major American literary award, including the Pulitzer Prize for his major novel American Pastoral (1997).|$|E

Madame Tussauds wax museum {{unveiled}} an exhibit featuring a likeness of Anne Frank in 2012. Asteroid 5535 Annefrank was named in her honour in 1995, after having been discovered in 1942.|$|E
500|$|Spiegelman {{has stated}} {{he does not}} see himself {{primarily}} as a visual artist, one who instinctively sketches or doodles. [...] He has said he approaches {{his work as a}} writer as he lacks confidence in his graphic skills. [...] He subjects his dialogue and visuals to constant revision—he reworked some dialogue balloons in Maus up to forty times. [...] A critic in The New Republic compared Spiegelman's dialogue writing to a young <b>Philip</b> <b>Roth</b> in his ability [...] "to make the Jewish speech of several generations sound fresh and convincing".|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Cruz {{appeared}} in the lead female role in Manolete, a biopic of bullfighter Manuel Laureano Rodríguez Sánchez, playing Antoñita [...] "Lupe" [...] Sino. She also {{appeared in}} The Good Night, playing two characters, Anna and Melody. TV Guide film critic Maitland McDonagh noted that in the film Cruz [...] "expertly mines the contrast between chic, compliant, white-clad Anna and funky, street-wise Melody, who treats [...] Gary like the world-class drag he is". In 2008, Cruz appeared in Isabel Coixet's film Elegy, {{which was based on}} the <b>Philip</b> <b>Roth</b> story The Dying Animal, as the lead female role, Consuela Castillo. Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described Cruz's performance as being [...] "outstanding in an otherwise lame male fantasy [...] ".|$|E
