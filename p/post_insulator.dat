50|$|The most {{important}} {{limit on the}} design of the wrapping machinery is the total combined weight of the equipment and the payload of cable. This weight is applied to the overhead line during the wrapping installation and so the host conductor and its supports must be capable of sustaining the extra load during the installation process. A typical limit is that the tension in the host conductor must not increase to more than 50% of its rated breaking strength during the wrapping installation. Other limits can apply as well, such as the bending loads on a cross-arm or cantilever load on a <b>post</b> <b>insulator.</b> Typically, when installations are carried out in benign weather conditions, the loads on the overhead line are within the limits imposed by the tolerances for extreme weather events.|$|E

40|$|This project {{presents}} {{the study of}} electric field stress along {{the surface of a}} 132 kV ceramic <b>post</b> <b>insulator.</b> Insulators are among the important devices of the electric power transmission systems. They are used to support and separate conductors at high voltage. Different insulator shapes have been obtained by varying several parameters, which defines the shape of the <b>post</b> <b>insulator.</b> For each insulator shape, the maximum electric field stress occurring on the insulator surface has been determined under clean and dry environment. The COMSOL Multiphysics software has been employed to investigate the electric field stress along the insulator’s surface. The full detailed model of a dry and clean ceramic 132 kV <b>post</b> <b>insulator</b> with 25 sheds has been developed for the base model calculation. The maximum value of electric field stress was found to be at the junction between the porcelain and the end fitting. End fittings with round edges tend to reduce the electric field stress along the insulator’s surface. With smaller first shed’s outer corner radius, the electric field stress slightly decreases. The electric field stress of the 25 th shed near the top end fitting tends to reduce as the shed’s inclination angle is increased. Furthermore, as the shed’s diameter increases, the electric field stress increases except at the shed’s outer corner where the electric field stress decreases. With greater distance between the first shed and the bottom end fitting, the electric field stress becomes lower. The end fittings design was found to be significantly affecting the electric field stress along the surface of the <b>post</b> <b>insulator.</b> A modified <b>post</b> <b>insulator</b> is proposed and proven to have a better performance in term of electric field stress...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{investigation of}} 132 kV field-aged ceramic <b>post</b> <b>insulator,</b> {{which has been}} in service 15 years old on a 132 kV in PMU Skudai substation. Insulators are devices which are used in electricity supply networks to support, separate or contain conductors at high voltage. Aging of ceramic and <b>post</b> <b>insulator</b> materials is reviewed mainly from the standpoint of their interfacial performance. Insulating materials can be divided into simple ceramics. Aging processes are complicated in general, and take place under simultaneous multiple stresses such as electrical, mechanical and environmental stresses. Contact angle measured insulation under consideration leads to the surface is approximately horizontal to the top surface. The sheds also aged differently around their circumference and this is reflected in discoloration differences on different sides of the insulator, in addition to hydrophobicity changes. Voltage breakdown measurements carried out in the laboratory are also presented. Material analysis shows oxidation of the surface. Ageing effects were different uniform for each shed, the greatest oxidation being on the top surfaces of the sheds on the west and east side. Microscopy was found to be the most useful and effective tools for analysis of these ceramic insulator. The measurements of the various parameters over the whole surface of the insulators are found to be consistent with each other and can be interpreted in terms of the chemistry of ageing and the longer term performance of the specific insulators in question. Two distinct types of ageing are identified. The role of solar radiation appears critical. In summary, the post insulators which have been in service for 15 years have very non-uniform surface properties in both the vertical and circumferential directions.

40|$|Use of {{polymeric}} materials for high voltage outdoor insulation systems is increasing continuously. Insulating polymers gradually replace traditional materials like porcelain and glass and become dominant at ultra high voltages, e. g., in 1000 kV ac and 800 kV dc overhead power transmissions, which are presently being developed. Polymeric materials in such systems {{are exposed to}} extremely high electric stresses that can become strong enough to initiate discharge activities in the surrounding air, e. g., in form of corona. Such discharges lead to generation of free electrical charges, which, while being deposited and accumulated at gas-solid interfaces, may alter the electric field distribution in the insulation system and result in unexpected performance. The presented work focuses on developing computational tools for analyzing three constitutive processes of the phenomenon involved; namely, corona discharge in air and charging of {{polymeric materials}} surfaces, relaxation of deposited surface charges at gas-solid interfaces and evaluation of flashover characteristics of polymeric insulators in presence of surface charges. Physical backgrounds, mathematical formulations and computer implementations of the three developed models are presented in the thesis. Validation of the approaches used is carried out by comparing results of computer simulations with those obtained from measurements and available in the literature. The verified models are further employed to analyze several study cases. Thus, positive impulse corona modes in air in a needle-plane electrode arrangement, charging of thick polymeric materials samples by burst and glow positive coronas in air and effect of humidity on corona current and charge generation during corona activity are investigated using the developed model of corona discharge. Further, relaxations of charges deposited on surfaces of silicone and ethylene-propylene-diene-monomer based rubber samples are considered. The corresponding computer model accounts for several mechanisms of charge decay, e. g., neutralization by atmospheric ions, charge injection and transport in the solid material.

Based on field observations, the probability of flashover of EHV <b>post</b> <b>insulators</b> is higher than line insulators under the same heavy icing conditions. The flashover along the insulators is caused mainly {{by the presence of}} a water film on the ice surfaces (melting period) and partial arcs in ice-free zones (air gaps). One of the mitigation options is the use of booster sheds (BSs) to create air gaps along the iced insulator. A booster shed (BS) is a flexible c-shape device made of high-quality insulating materials. Since BSs are easy to use, they seem to be simpler alternatives to upgrading insulators to those designed for cold climate regions.

The electrical performance of RTV silicone rubber insulator coatings under accelerated aging in a salt-fog chamber for artificial testing has been investigated. Experimental and theoretical {{studies were carried out}} on RTV silicone rubber coatings to study the loss and recovery of hydrophobicity. The effect of the experimental conditions and the contaminants deposited during dry band arcing was studied with respect to the performance of RTV coatings. Five cleaning methods to remove the contaminants from the coated surface were examined using leakage current and contact angle measurements as indicators of their comparative effectiveness. Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDAX) was used to determine the composition of the elements of the scale near the surface and in the bulk of the RTV coating. The ability of RTV coatings to suppress leakage current in the presence of contamination thereby preventing power outages was extensively studied. The temporary loss of hydrophobicity and its recovery was studied in depth. The gradual loss of hydrophobicity as determined from the leakage current and the contact angle measurements is shown {{to be related to the}} physical and chemical changes to the coating brought about by dry band arcing. The suppression of leakage current by RTV silicone rubber coatings on porcelain suspension and <b>post</b> <b>insulators</b> was studied in a salt-fog chamber. To investigate the phenomenon of the loss and the recovery of hydrophobicity, the surface was subjected to various wetting conditions. Measurements of the contact and the sliding angles were used to determine the state of the surface. The surface free energies due to London dispersion (γ SD) and hydrogen bonding (γ SH) forces on the surface of RTV coatings were calculated from the contact angle measurements using both water and methylene iodide. Good agreement was obtained with the literature values for a virgin RTV surface. In order to study the chemical changes due to dry band arcing on the surface of RTV coatings, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA) was employed. A study of the diffusion of silicone fluid using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is carried out. The results of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and ESCA measurements are discussed from which a suppression mechanism of leakage current is suggested. The chemical derivative analysis is also carried out to elucidate the chemical changes on the surface of RTV coating. Several mechanisms are suggested with regard to the formation of water film, the suppression of leakage current on RTV coatings, development of dry band arcing, the temporary loss and recovery of hydrophobicity, heat transfer in the presence of dry band arcing, and chemical reactions and changes at the surface due to dry band arcing.

40|$|Polymer {{composites}} {{have been}} widely employed as electrical insulating materials for high voltage components and devices such as power cables, gas-insulated systems, rotating machines, line and <b>post</b> <b>insulators,</b> etc. Such materials are usually made by introducing inorganic oxides (SiO 2, TiO 2, Al 2 O 3, MgO) into polymeric matrices e. g. polyethylene (PE), epoxy, silicone rubber. Reported experimental evidences indicate improvements which can be achieved in dielectric strength, partial discharge resistance, and life time of the polymer composites as compared to their base materials. However, the reasons behind the advancements in materials’ electrical performance have not been clearly elucidated in many cases. In this context, the present thesis concentrates on analyzing the influence of filler particles on transport of charge carriers in two polymer-based insulations namely nanofilled PE and microfilled enamel, which are novel insulating materials for high voltage direct current (HVDC) cables and electric motors, respectively. The contribution of internal interfaces between insulating layers existing in multi-layered structures to their electrical conduction is also considered. As for PE nanocomposites and its unfilled counterpart, specimens of thin films were prepared, whereas multi-layered structures were made by pressing them together at high temperature. Charging currents measured at various temperatures indicated a remarkable reduction in DC conductivity of the nanofilled dielectrics as compared to PE, making the former preferable insulating materials for HVDC cables, especially for those working under enhanced electric stresses. The observed effect {{was associated with the}} decreased charge mobility and increased trap energy in the nanocomposites as compared to the corresponding properties of unfilled PE. By comparing the measured currents obtained on single-layered and multi-layered structures, the impact of insulation–insulation interface on electrical conduction was revealed and analyzed. Further, the field dependencies were established for the transient currents and the quasi-steady state currents that were utilized for examining the dominant conduction mechanisms in the studied materials. A computer model was employed for studying the generation and transport of charge carriers in the insulations at various temperatures. The simulations demonstrated that apart from the reasons mentioned above, the weakening charge transport process in the nanocomposites is in great extent caused by the suppression of charge injection at the electrode–insulation interfaces. On the other hand, the insulation coatings of enameled wires are inherently multi-layered structures consisting of at least two layers of different materials. This study focuses on partial discharge resistant enamel insulation that was created by introducing chromium oxide (Cr 2 O 3) particles of micrometer size into the base polymer. Experiments were conducted mainly on multi-layered enamel coatings, while some tests were also performed on single-layered flat samples and filler powder. Thus, contributions of each phase (filler and polymer matrix) to the electrical conduction and dielectric response of the filled enamel were highlighted. Charge transport in the multi-layered enamel coatings was studied in details by analyzing the surface potential decay characteristics. Accordingly, potential decay mechanisms due to the combination of charge injection, polarization, and intrinsic conduction were revealed, each of them dominating within a certain time interval. Based on that, a computer model of charge transport in multi-layered insulating structures was developed to reproduce the measured surface potentials. In this model, the consideration of the barrier effect of the internal interface is of utmost importance...|$|R
