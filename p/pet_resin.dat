40|$|Poly(ethylene terephthalate), or PET, is a {{thermoplastic}} polyester resin. Such resins may {{be classified}} as low-viscosity or high-viscosity <b>resins.</b> Low-viscosity <b>PET</b> typically has an intrinsic viscosity of less than 0. 75, while high-viscosity PET typically has an intrinsic viscosity of 0. 9 or higher. Low-viscosity resins, which are {{sometimes referred to as}} "staple " PET (when used in textile applications), are used {{in a wide variety of}} products, such as apparel fiber, bottles, and photographic film. High-viscosity resins, sometimes referred to as "industrial " or "heavy denier " PET, are used in tire cord, seat belts, and the like. PET is used extensively in the manufacture of synthetic fibers (i. e., polyester fibers), which compose the largest segment of the synthetic fiber industry. Since it is a pure and regulated material meeting FDA food contact requirements, PET is also widely used in food packaging, such as beverage bottles and frozen food trays that can be heated in a microwave or conventional oven. PET bottles are used for a variety of foods and beverages, including alcohol, salad dressing, mouthwash, syrups, peanut butter, and pickled food. Containers made of PET are being used for toiletries, cosmetics, and household and pharmaceutical products (e. g., toothpaste pumps). Other applications of <b>PET</b> include molding <b>resins,</b> X-ray and other photographic films, magnetic tape, electrical insulation, printing sheets, and food packaging film. 6. 6. 2. 2 Process Description 3 - 15 <b>PET</b> <b>resins</b> are produced commercially from ethylene glycol (EG) and either dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) or terephthalic acid (TPA).

50|$|In {{order to}} produce the {{polyester}} melt with a high efficiency, high-output processing steps like staple fiber (50-300 tonnes/day per spinning line) or POY /FDY (up to 600 tonnes/day split into about 10 spinning machines) are meanwhile more and more vertically integrated direct processes. This means the polymer melt is directly converted into the textile fibers or filaments without the common step of pelletizing. We are talking about full vertical integration when polyester is produced at one site starting from crude oil or distillation products in the chain oil → benzene → PX → PTA → PET melt → fiber/filament or bottle-grade resin. Such integrated processes are meanwhile established in more or less interrupted processes at one production site.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) dominates the carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) market as the main material used in this application due to its toughness, clarity and superior barrier properties. Currently, the CSD bottles constitute 40 % of the global PET consumption. PET bottles demonstrate favourable life cycle inventories compared to alternative packaging materials such as aluminium and glass. Manufacturing of the bottles starts with the production of <b>PET</b> <b>resin</b> from petrochemicals.

It highlights the strategies employed by a producer of <b>PET</b> <b>resin,</b> to launch onto the Brazilian market a fiber manufactured from recycled plastic, called Alya Eco. A case study was performed with the collection of secondary data, analysis of documents and conducting semi-structured interviews. It was possible to reveal the complexities of integrating “green” capabilities into product development. Environmental businesses must deal with relations that are marked by intense social pressure and legal intricacies, as well as the presence of multiple stakeholders with diverse motivations, conceptions and managerial capacities to deal with the environmental issues. The incorporation of the environmental dimension into the product strategy implied a change in the conventional concept of its supply chain towards the adoption of a closed-loop supply chain. This means that the success of Project Alya ECO depended not only on the capability of executives to manage environmental innovation strategies, but also on their ability to integrate the activities of other partners into the production chain. This paper attempts to advance our understanding of the managerial, technical and operational issues facing the integration of innovation development strategies for “green” products along the supply chain...|$|E
40|$|Polyester is an {{engineering}} polymer that {{is commonly used}} for food and beverage packaging applications due to its strong mechanical properties, high transparency and strong permeability resistance. However, the as-polymerized polyesters are low in tensile properties such as tensile strength and toughness due to their low average molecular weights immediately after polycondensation synthesis. In order to enhance the tensile properties, a second stage synthesis, e. g.,solid state polymerization and reactive extrusions {{with the use of}} chain extenders, is employed after the initial polycondensation process. The use of chain extenders has been shown to speed up the second stage polymerization reaction. In this study, four different concentrations of chain extender (0 %, 0. 15 %, 0. 25 % and 0. 5 %) has been used to investigate the effect of chain extender on microrheology of polyesters, besides, we aim to study whether it is advantageous to introduce chain extenders during the polycondensation process such that the second stage polymerization can either be shortened or removed. First, effect of chain extender concentration on the dynamic rheological response of the <b>PET</b> <b>resin</b> was studied. Dynamic frequency sweeps show that branching effects introduced in the <b>PET</b> <b>resin</b> leads to a significant shear thinning effects, and the relaxation time constants in the polymer resin are enhanced as shown in the step-strain stress relaxation behavior. The shear-thinning response implies {{that it is possible to}} achieve higher molecular weight during a one-stage polymerization process. Additionally, the elasticity of the PET resins is improved as shown in the Cole-Cole plots. Second, whilst the effect of chain extenders shows a lower crystallinity both on the static crystallization behavior and stress-induced crystallization of PET resins, it results in due to the restriction of chain mobilities. Furthermore, the reduction in Tm and Tcc, while the increasing in Thc and Tg are observed after original PET being chain extended by different concentrations of chain extenders. As to the thermal stability, PET with the addition of 0. 5 % chain extender owns 7 °C higher degradation temperature compare with original PET. Third, the enhanced elasticity leads to enhanced drawability of the resin after glass transition. This means that the chain-extended PETs are able to form large bubbles for blowing into bottles during the bottle blowing process. However, for bottle applications, high-crystallinity is necessary for both mechanical and permeability resistances; we find that higher drawn ratio (5 : 1) could be applied to obtain similar crystallinity in order to fulfill the mechanical requirement. In summary, the use of chain extenders during polymerization is effective in enhancing molecular weights of PET during polymerization due to the stronger shear thinning effects induced by the branching effects. The branching effects are also responsible for the enhanced elasticity of resin after glass transition and higher drawability. In the meantime, higher orientation can make up lower stress-induced crystallization of chain extended PET during bottle blowing process...|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{production}} of ethylene glycol in the United States began in 1925 (McClelland and Rector 1951; Miller 1966). The reported U. S. production volume was 2. 189 million pounds (993 metric tons) during that year (McClelland and Rector 1951). Large-scale commercial use of ethylene glycol as an antifreeze began in 1930; this use {{led to a}} strong demand for ethylene glycol, especially during and after World War II (Brown et al. 1980; McClelland and Rector 1951). Production volume information is not available for this period. By 1950, the U.

Production continued to rise steadily, reaching approximately 900, 000 metric tons by 1968 (Brown et al. 1980). Ethylene glycol production rose more dramatically in late 1960 s and early 1970 s due to the additional demand for use of this substance in the manufacturing of polyester fiber and film (Brown et al. 1980; CMR 1972, 1975). Production in 1970 was approximately 1, 400, 000 metric tons (Brown et al. 1980). Production fluctuated between 1, 500, 000 and 1, 800, 000 metric tons over the next 18 years, reaching 1, 820, 000 metric tons by 1978 (Brown et al. 1980). Production volume information is not available for years following 1978; however, production capacity data for the 1980 s, 1990 s, and early 2000 s have been located. Total reported U. S. production capacities were 2, 638, 000 metric tons during 1981, 2, 820, 000 metric tons during 1990, 3, 727, 000 metric tons during 2001, and 3, 242, 000 metric tons during 2008 (CMR 1981, 1990, 2001; SRI 2008). The growth of ethylene glycol production capacity over these decades {{has been attributed to}} the demand for this substance in the manufacture of plastics, especially polyethylene terephthalate (<b>PET)</b> <b>resin</b> bottles (CM...|$|E

It is argued that with the integration of the cycling notion it is possible to elaborate a strategy that makes it possible to reduce costs, to prepare (themselves for new obligations that will, nevertheless, have marketing and institutional advantages. The companies who find in the ecology an innovation factor are repositioning themselves in relation to the environmental issues. This approach can be materialized through the practice of ecodesign, what presupposes the existence of a productive chain that is progressing, where the companies associate themselves with, in order to develop new products that will have a lesser impact on the environment and to restore new approaches of innovations. We present the strategies of an Italian multinational, a great producer of <b>PET</b> <b>resin</b> (polyethylene terephthalate), for the launching in Brazil of a fiber elaborated from the recycling of PET bottles, fulfilling, thus, the first cycle of the product and starting the second cycle, that is as noble as the first one. The research is our case study, where we used secondary data-collecting, analysis of documents and semi-structured interviews. The results point to the conclusion that that the environment requirements stimulates the creativity and can be the origin of bigger evolutions: new functionalities, new materials, new technologies and new uses for the products. Therefore, as they try to integrate the environment to their strategy to develop new products, the company in question developed a “win-win” approach, as this strategy is a winner for the company {{as well as for the}} environment.
