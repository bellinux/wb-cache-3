5|$|Climate {{research}} on live coral species {{is limited to}} a few studied species. Studying Porites coral provides a stable foundation for geochemical interpretations that is much simpler to <b>physically</b> extract data in comparison to Platygyra species where the complexity of Platygyra species skeletal structure creates difficulty when <b>physically</b> sampled, which happens {{to be one of the}} only multidecadal living coral records used for coral paleoclimate modeling.|$|E

5|$|A {{key action}} which <b>physically</b> connects {{the keys and}} the windchests is a {{mechanical}} or tracker action. Connection is achieved {{through a series of}} rods called trackers. When the organist depresses a key, the corresponding tracker pulls open its pallet, allowing wind to enter the pipe.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>physically</b> separate, another {{facility}} {{built in}} nearby Roquetoire {{was an integral}} part of the Wizernes complex. Umspannwerk C was built to house a Leitstrahl radio command guidance system which could be used to send course corrections to missiles launched from Wizernes to fine-tune their trajectory during the launch phase.|$|E
5|$|Although the AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} {{is often}} useful {{for studying the}} properties of black holes, most of the black holes considered {{in the context of}} AdS/CFT are <b>physically</b> unrealistic. Indeed, as explained above, most versions of the AdS/CFT correspondence involve higher-dimensional models of spacetime with unphysical supersymmetry.|$|E
5|$|Barrier {{contraceptives}} are {{devices that}} attempt to prevent pregnancy by <b>physically</b> preventing sperm from entering the uterus. They include male condoms, female condoms, cervical caps, diaphragms, and contraceptive sponges with spermicide.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the basic}} moves of the pieces, rules also govern the {{equipment}} used, time control, conduct and ethics of players, accommodations for <b>physically</b> challenged players, and recording of moves using chess notation. Procedures for resolving irregularities {{that can occur}} during a game are provided as well.|$|E
5|$|Born to Jane and Scott Sauerbrunn in St. Louis, Missouri, Becky {{was raised}} with two older {{brothers}}, Grant and Adam. Growing up, her brothers motivated her {{to step up}} for herself and become <b>physically</b> and mentally tough.|$|E

It, too, occupies its original site.|$|E

5|$|He {{was quoted}} by Rangers radio {{broadcasters}} {{as saying that}} he never intended to <b>physically</b> harm Lefebvre but did {{want to speak to}} him; Daniels said he was upset that someone he didn't know was judging him.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's {{policies}} {{resulted in}} the killing of nearly two million non-Jewish Poles, over three million Soviet prisoners of war, communists and other political opponents, homosexuals, the <b>physically</b> and mentally disabled, Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists, and trade unionists. Hitler did not speak publicly about the killings, and seems never to have visited the concentration camps.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} London International tournament Staunton {{challenged}} Anderssen to a match of twenty-one games, for £100. Anderssen accepted the challenge but the match {{could not be}} arranged: Staunton was <b>physically</b> unfit for an immediate contest, and Anderssen {{had to return to}} work.|$|E

5|$|M. NourbeSe Philip's 2008 book of poems, Zong!, {{is based}} on the events {{surrounding}} the massacre and uses the account of the King's Bench hearing as its primary material. Philip's text <b>physically</b> deconstructs the account as a method for undermining the document's authority.|$|E
5|$|Marseille was {{becoming}} <b>physically</b> {{exhausted by the}} frenetic pace of combat.

5|$|Natural uranium {{consists}} of 99.3% uranium-238 and 0.7% uranium-235, {{but only the}} latter is fissile. The chemically identical uranium-235 has to be <b>physically</b> separated from the more plentiful isotope. Various methods were considered for uranium enrichment, most of which was carried out at Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Reference is {{the notion}} that a word symbolizes or stands in for an object, action, or event. Words {{consistently}} stand for their referents, even if referents are not <b>physically</b> present in context.|$|E
5|$|Several {{historic}} figures {{appear in}} supporting roles including Fritz Lang (<b>physically</b> based on King Bradley), Rudolf Hess, Karl Haushofer, and Adolf Hitler. The Earth counterparts of Maes Hughes {{and his wife}} Gracia appear in supporting roles, along with cameos from other characters.|$|E
5|$|Seymour was {{declared}} <b>physically</b> unfit for service in World War I. However, {{he worked in}} wartime jobs in the Speedway shipyards and Bush terminal. While working in the shipyards, he contracted tuberculosis, and died at his home on September 20, 1919. He was interred in Albany Rural Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Some {{overseas}} viewing {{prints were}} <b>physically</b> edited for content by local censor boards, before transmission for reasons such as excessive violence, fright-inducing material, and, in some cases, the conservative personal {{views of the}} censors. Hence, episodes recovered from these sources (Australia, New Zealand) are missing these segments.|$|E
5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It {{looks the}} same no matter how one rotates it, and the resulting rotational symmetry {{is referred to as}} isotropy of space. In the present case it is common to use passive rotations, meaning that the observer rotates themself. Mathematically, the active operation of a rotation is performed by multiplying position vectors by a rotation matrix. A passive rotation is accomplished by rotating only the basis vectors of the coordinate system. (The coordinate system {{can be thought of as}} being fixed in the rotated observer. The observer is <b>physically</b> rotated.) In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it was somehow <b>physically</b> rigidly rotated.|$|E
