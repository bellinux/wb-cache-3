2500|$|Heating of the EUV mask <b>pellicle</b> (<b>film</b> {{temperature}} up to 750 K for 80 W incident power) is {{a significant}} concern, due to the resulting deformation and transmission decrease. ASML developed a 70nm thick polysilicon pellicle membrane, which allows EUV transmission of 82%; however, {{less than half of}} the membranes survived expected EUV power levels. SiNx pellicle membranes also failed at 82 W equivalent EUV source power levels. [...] Alternative [...] materials need to allow sufficient transmission as well as maintain mechanical and thermal stability. However, graphite, graphene or other carbon nanomaterials (nanosheets, nanotubes) are damaged by EUV due to the release of electrons and also too easily etched in the hydrogen cleaning plasma expected to be deployed in EUV scanners. [...] Hydrogen plasmas can also etch silicon as well. A coating helps improve hydrogen resistance, but this reduces transmission and/or emissivity, and may also affect mechanical stability (e.g., bulging). The current lack of any suitable pellicle material, aggravated by the use of hydrogen plasma cleaning in the EUV scanner, presents an obstacle to volume production.|$|E

KMC-derived cellulose-based <b>pellicle</b> <b>film</b> {{is known as}} a highly adaptive microbial macrocolony - a stratified community of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In the framework of the multipurpose international astrobiological project "BIOlogy and Mars Experiment (BIOMEX)," which aims to study the vitality of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and the stability of selected biomarkers in low Earth orbit and in a Mars-like environment, a cellulose polymer structural integrity will be assessed as a biomarker and biotechnological nanomaterial. In a preflight assessment program for BIOMEX, the mineralized bacterial cellulose did not exhibit significant changes in the structure under all types of tests. KMC members that inhabit the cellulose-based pellicle exhibited a high survival rate; however, the survival capacity depended on a variety of stressors such as the vacuum of space, a Mars-like atmosphere, UVC radiation, and temperature fluctuations. The critical limiting factor for microbial survival was high-dose UV irradiation. In the tests that simulated a 1 -year mission of exposure outside the International Space Station, the core populations of bacteria and yeasts survived and provided protection against UV; however, the microbial density of the populations overall was reduced, which was revealed by implementation of culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. Reduction of microbial richness was also associated with a lower accumulation of chemical elements in the cellulose-based <b>pellicle</b> <b>film,</b> produced by microbiota that survived in the post-test experiments, as compared to untreated cultures that populated the film.

40|$|The {{acquired}} dental pellicle plays {{a critical}} role in the adhesion and detachment of dental plaque bacteria. It has been reported that titanium dioxide biomaterials decompose single-protein films by photocatalysis. However, it is not known whether this can also be achieved with complex structured <b>pellicle</b> <b>films.</b> This in vitro study investigated in real-time the formation and photocatalytic decomposition of human pellicle at anatase-saliva interfaces. Nanostructured polycrystalline anatase layers were deposited on titanium-coated quartz crystals by magnetron-sputtering, serving as a model for titanium implant surfaces. The quartz crystals were used as acoustic sensors in a quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) system with dissipation. In situ UV irradiation of pellicle-covered anatase caused a statistically significant decrease of the adsorbed salivary mass. In contrast, photocatalytic decomposition of pellicle could not be observed on reference titanium surfaces. Wettability characterization revealed superhydrophilicity of anatase upon UV irradiation, whereas titanium was unaffected. XPS measurements provide further information concerning the decomposition of the salivary films. The results suggest that the photocatalytic activity of polycrystalline anatase-modified biomaterial surfaces is able to decompose complex structured macromolecular <b>pellicle</b> <b>films.</b> Therefore, this study opens the way to surface modifications supporting therapeutic approaches of biofilm removal...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of 157 nm {{as the next}} optical lithography wavelength has created a need for new soft (polymeric) or hard (quartz) pellicle materials. Pellicles should be> 98 % transparent to incident 157 nm light and, ideally, sufficiently resistant to photochemical damage to remain useful for an exposure lifetime of 7. 5 kJ/cm 2. The transparency specification has been met. We have developed families of experimental Teflonâ„¢AF (TAFx) polymers with> 98 % transparency which can be spin coated and lifted as micron-scale, unsupported membranes. Still higher transparencies should be possible once optimization of intrinsic (composition, end groups, impurities, molecular weight) and extrinsic (oxygen, absorbed hydrocarbons, contaminants) factors are completed. The measured transparencies of actual <b>pellicle</b> <b>films,</b> however, are affected by many factors other than absorption. Film thickness must be precisely controlled so as to allow operation at the fringe maxima for the lithographic wavelength. Roughness and thickness uniformity are also critical. An {{important part of our}} program has thus been learning how to spin membranes from the solvents that dissolve our pellicle candidates. Meeting the durability specification at 157 nm remains a major concern. The 157 nm radiation durability lifetime of a polymer is determined by two fundamental properties: the fraction of 157 nm radiation absorbed and the fraction (quantum efficiency) of this absorbed radiation that results in photochemical darkening. Originally it was assumed that lifetim...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Candida species {{including}} Candida krusei {{have become}} common pathogens, especially in immune-compromised patients. Pellicle {{on the surface}} of incubating nutrient broth extending with an adherent film above the broth {{has been described as a}} feature of this organism. We investigated whether this easily observable adherent film could be useful in the identification of this yeast. We also wanted to see if this process involved any morphological changes from the yeast form on the part of C. krusei. Findings Common and less frequently isolated species of Candida were inoculated into YPD broth and observed for pellicle formation. For C. krusei different inoculum sizes and time periods were studied to establish earliest period and the smallest number of organisms needed for this process. A cover-slip assay was established to observe the architecture of the film formed by this organism. Among the clinically common Candida species, only C. krusei formed a visible film, requiring 10 6 organisms to produce it at 24 hours post inoculation. Film formation also differentiated C. krusei from C. inconspicua usually reported as a complex by carbohydrate assimilation assays. Rarely isolated C. famata and C. norvegensis also formed <b>pellicles</b> and <b>film</b> but less robustly. Microscopic observations of the film showed only yeast forms, no hypha or pseudohypha were seen. Conclusions Pellicle formation following inoculation of a clinical specimen into liquid culture, is a useful alert to the probable presence of C. krusei and likely fluconazole resistance, while awaiting the results of more definitive identification assays. <b>Pellicle</b> and adherence <b>film</b> formation are not a result of polymorphic changes on the part of C. krusei as only yeast forms were present. </p...|$|R

40|$|In vitro salivary pellicles {{were found}} to be less {{hydrophobic}} by water contact angles than clinically formed pellicles. In this study, water contact angles were measured on enamel coated with pellicles adsorbed from reconstituted human whole saliva (RHWS) and after exposure to dentifrices or dietary components. In addition, adhesion of Streptococcus oralis J 22 to pellicles formed from RHWS with minor amounts of milk added and after exposure to dentifrices was studied. Exposure of RHWS-pellicles to milk or salad oil yielded an increase in the hydrophobicity of in vitro pellicles to values observed in vivo, but a decrease was seen after exposure to a sugar solution. Pellicles formed from saliva with 0. 4 % milk added attracted less S. oralis cells than pellicles formed in the absence of milk components. Exposure of pellicles formed from saliva with milk added to various dentifrices had a variable effect on bacterial adhesion: markedly lower numbers of adhering S. oralis were found for a dentifrice with NaF, but exposure to dentifrices containing SnF 2 or hexametaphosphate showed slightly increased adhesion. In summary, dietary components have influence on the hydrophobicity of enamel pellicles, while combinations of dietary components and dentifrices certainly influence the adhesiveness of the pellicles. The effects of dietary components on <b>pellicle</b> conditioning <b>film</b> should be taken into consideration in research on the development of ingredients to control intraoral surface chemistry and microbiology, {{as well as in the}} development of oral products...|$|R

The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the adsorption/desorption behavior of human saliva on model surfaces grafted with polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer mols. compared to self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) exhibiting the same terminal functions (-NH 2, -COOH) by two complementary anal. methods. Furthermore, the role of saliva conditioning of PAMAM and analogous SAM modifications on the adhesion of Streptococcus gordonii DL 1, an early oral colonizer, was investigated. In contrast to SAMs, PAMAM-grafted surfaces showed reduced streptococcal adherence in the absence of pre-adsorbed saliva similar to the level obtained for poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) coatings. Moreover, coatings of PAMAM-NH 2 maintained their bacteria-repellent behavior even after saliva-conditioning. As a general outcome, it was found that lower amts. of protein adsorbed on PAMAM coatings than on analogous SAMs. Since this study demonstrates that covalently bound PAMAM dendrimers can modulate the oral bacterial response, this approach has significant potential for the development of anti-adhesive biomaterial surfaces that are conditioned with proteinaceous films...|$|R

40|$|A {{conditioning}} <b>film,</b> the <b>pellicle,</b> {{of which}} many salivary proteins are important constituents, covers the surfaces {{present in the}} mouth. The pellicle forms in a selective adsorption process, and it has protective and lubricating functions {{as well as an}} influence on the adherence of oral microbes that ultimately leads to the development of dental plaque. Understanding the interactions responsible for the selective pellicle formation would make it possible to strive at creating a pellicle that serves its protective and lubricating functions and also promotes a healthy biofilm {{for the benefit of the}} individual. The aim of this research was to characterize the adsorption of salivary proteins to different types of substrates, to evaluate the influence of different protein-surface interactions on the adsorption process, and also to assess substrate dependent differences in film composition. Furthermore, as it is well known that complexes form between different salivary proteins and mucins (large glycoproteins) in bulk saliva, the aim was also to study interactions between mucins and other pellicle constituents at the solid/liquid interface. Additionally, the effects of a surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), on the protein films were investigated, to evaluate the stability of the films and also the possibilities to completely remove the in vivo formed pellicle. The adsorption experiments were performed in vitro using null ellipsometry, by which parameters such as adsorbed amount per unit area and average layer thickness can be obtained. Hydrophilic and hydrophobized silica were used as model substrates. The adsorption behaviour of the cationic, antimicrobial proteins lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase, lysozyme, and histatin 5 indicated that the adsorption on hydrophilic substrates was mainly driven by electrostatics, while on hydrophobized substrates hydrophobic interactions also influenced the adsorption process. Furthermore, it was shown that 12 sequential alternating adsorption of the anionic salivary mucin MUC 5 B and lactoperoxidase resulted in the build-up of multilayered structures on the surface. The rate of build-up was influenced by the surface characteristics. Sequential adsorption studies showed that neither MUC 5 B nor human whole saliva (HWS) was able to exchange substantial amounts of the pre-adsorbed anionic pellicle proteins acidic proline-rich protein 1 (PRP- 1) or statherin, respectively. The resistance of the adsorbed mixed protein films to SDS elution depended on surface properties as well as on the number of layers adsorbed and adsorbed components. Pre-adsorbed PRP- 1 was to some extent protected from SDS elution by the sequential adsorption of MUC 5 B to the PRP- 1 <b>film.</b> <b>Pellicles</b> formed on natural tooth enamel were collected in vivo and investigated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE). Mechanicallyassisted SDS elution was used to collect the in vivo formed pellicle. The effectiveness of the collection procedure was validated in vitro by means of mechanical removal in combination with HCl treatment. The results indicated that rubbing the tooth surfaces with fibre pellets soaked in 0. 5 % (w/v) SDS was sufficient to completely remove the pellicle from human enamel. In addition, 2 -DE analysis of pellicles formed in vitro on human enamel and the dental materials titanium and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) showed differences in composition when compared to each other, revealing that the pellicle is influenced by the substrate properties...|$|R
