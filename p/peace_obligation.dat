40|$|This essay {{focuses on}} the clause of {{industrial}} <b>peace</b> <b>obligation</b> provided by company-wide collective agreements of Pomigliano, Mirafiori and Fabbrica Italia Pomigliano (but the last one aims to become the new national car sector collective agreement). The clause is critically analysed first of all with regard to unions’ responsibility. Such a responsibility results from the subscription of an obligation of industrial peace which compels unions to abstain from calling industrial action (strike and other struggle forms), {{in order to ensure}} a peaceful or no conflicting implementation of the agreement, and thereby work and production continuity. The author considers this extent of <b>peace</b> <b>obligation</b> to be abnormal and not compatible with workers’ protection function of the unions. Moreover, the author critically analyses the union peace clause from the stand point of his incidence on workers’ right to strike. The author shares the dominant thesis according to which the right to strike is an individual one; so she thinks that the strike of workers in industrial peace clause violation is fully legal...|$|E
40|$|The {{collective}} agreement contains many important provisions concerning {{the relationship between}} employers and employees. When a {{collective agreement}} applies in the workplace, both employers and employees are bound by it. However, only employers of those two, can {{take part in the}} collective agreement, and therefore negotiate the content of it. The {{purpose of this study is}} to answer the following question: Why are rules that has been interpreted in collective agreements not expressed in writing? Therefore, the Swedish collective agreement system will be examined, and a distinction between types of silent regulations will be made to find causes. The potential for workers to act on a collective agreement with quiet regulations will also be examined. Collective agreements are signed on three levels: central, union and local levels. Expressing interpreted rules in writing in collective agreements at all levels would require much time and money. But a rule that seeks to require the employee obligations, and that is not expressed in writing, may result in the employee commits a collective crime. A collective crime may raise liability to the counterparty. Interpretation of silent regulations is mainly relevant for the <b>peace</b> <b>obligation.</b> To commence action of conflict is the parties' way to force the result they want of the counterparty. If the parties control all the relations between them in detail to increase the predictability and stability in collective agreement relationships, the reasons for taking actions of conflict are to be fewer and the <b>peace</b> <b>obligation</b> is given greater extent. That the <b>peace</b> <b>obligation</b> is given greater extent is therefore a reason why interpreted rules are not expressed in writing. Silent regulations are to some extent so obvious and accepted obligations that one can assume that the worker has a good sense to recognize the rights and responsibilities he or she has. A reason to bring interpreted rules in collective agreements in writing does therefore not exist...|$|E

30|$|Job alliances, {{contracted}} {{by management}} and works councils {{and based on}} opening clauses in collective agreements, are predominantly introduced in larger companies. These firms combine the <b>peace</b> <b>obligations</b> (no strikes) associated with collective contracts and an institutionalized in-plant cooperation of management and works councils. Job alliances are expected to provide {{a higher degree of}} flexibility compared with the regulations of collective contracts. The research results show that in the short and medium term job alliances are not successful in stabilizing employment. Prerequisites for a success — employment development is less negative — are that management and works councils collaborate trustfully, job alliances are conceived for a longer period and prior to an imminent crisis and that the measures are coordinated (Hübler 2005 a, 2006).|$|R
30|$|But {{might it}} not be claimed that declining {{unionism}} has caused an unambiguous shortfall in worker voice, the provision of we have argued to be critical for microeconomic flexibility? If a prima facie case does exist for measures supportive of voice, the downside is the growth in bargaining power attendant upon measures favoring increased worker representation. The bargaining problem means that employers {{can be expected to}} vest voice institutions with too little power. This returns us to the appeal of the German model and method of workplace representation because of the practical limits placed on rent seeking by the works council, including a <b>peace</b> <b>obligation.</b> Indeed, we earlier conjectured that a German-like system may allow a decoupling of the factors that determine the size of the joint surplus of an establishment from the factors that determine its distribution.|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of the study compares the {{institutional}} settings of employee representation and collective bargaining in France and Germany. One important difference is that in France, many aspects of collective agreements are defined by labour law, whereas in Germany, collective bargaining partners are given far greater scope for negotiation. The second part of the study analyses the economic effects of different institutional settings. Greater wage flexibility has positive effects on competitiveness and employment. In {{the last part of the}} study, reform proposals made by Jean-Denis Combrexelle, President of the Department of Social Affairs of the government council, are evaluated. His proposals to enlarge the scope of collective bargaining and also allow firm-level bargaining are judged positively. Moving from the indeterminate duration of firm agreements to well-defined contract periods would reduce uncertainty for both firms and workers. The implementation of these reform proposals would be most effective if they were combined with a <b>peace</b> <b>obligation,</b> meaning that no strikes would be allowed for an agreed period of time. The proposal to maintain extensions of industrial agreements by the Labour Minister is counterproductive and would partly eliminate gains from other proposals...|$|E

The URNG functioned as an {{umbrella}} organization {{to represent the}} leftist beliefs amongst the Guatemalan people, particularly the Guatemalan poor. Although {{they were involved in}} attacks, their primary function was at the negotiation table with the Guatemalan government. From 1986 to 1996, the army and government were drawn into a peace process moderated and verified by the United Nations and including other international actors as key players. Both sides made major concessions. The Oslo Agreement (set in place by the UN) provided an arrangement for direct negotiation between the belligerent groups. This open negotiation led to the signing of the [...] "Agreement on Procedures in Search of Peace by Political Means" [...] in Mexico in 1991. The United Nations presided over these changes meant to create a long-lasting <b>peace.</b> <b>Obligations</b> were imposed on the government, including significant constitutional reforms, which were internationally binding and would be verified by the UN.|$|R

[...] Referring to when the Romans handled tumult the leaders of a divided city they had recently conquered (Ardea), Machiavelli believes {{that there are three}} possible ways to handle the leaders of rebellion within a held city: [...] "...either to kill them, as they did; or to remove them from the city; or to make them make <b>peace</b> together under <b>obligations</b> not to offend one another." [...] Machiavelli relates this belief to when, in his own times, Florence conquered the city of Pistoia. The Florentine rulers tried all 3 methods when handling the feuding houses of the city. He establishes {{that it is impossible to}} rule a divided city.|$|R

Nonetheless, the Talmud teaches that [...] "If someone comes with the intention to murder you, then one is obligated to kill in self-defense than be killed". The clear implication is that to bare one's throat would be tantamount to suicide (which Jewish law forbids) and {{it would also be}} considered helping a murderer kill someone and thus would [...] "place an obstacle in front of a blind man" [...] (i.e., makes it easier for another person to falter in their ways). The tension between the laws dealing with <b>peace,</b> and the <b>obligation</b> to self-defense, has led to a set of Jewish teachings that have been described as tactical-pacifism. This is the avoidance of force and violence whenever possible, but the use of force when necessary to save the lives of one's self and one's people.|$|R

Questions have arisen regarding the UN <b>peace</b> operations <b>obligations</b> to comply with international humanitarian law and international human rights law. During peace operations there have been incidents where peacekeepers have violated human rights and committed criminal offenses like sexual exploitation, using excessive force resulting {{in the death of}} civilians, and destruction of civilian property. The increased focus on violations of IHRL and IHL has led to increased focus on who is responsible for such wrongdoing, and to which entity the conduct is attributable to. The main question this thesis addresses is: What difficulties are there in holding the UN accountable for violations of international law in peace operations and how can they be overcome? This thesis will address three main difficulties: the UN s immunity, the UN s ability to adopt resolutions and policies, and how the threshold for attribution of conduct and the command and control system affect the possibility of holding the UN accountable. The focus is on the legal consequences for the UN for violations of international law in the context of UN authorized peace operations. How and to which entity the conduct should be attributed to, how this is shown in practice, and the threshold for the attribution of conduct will be evaluated. There remains uncertainty as regards to the content and application of the effective control test, and whether dual or multiple attribution of conduct is possible, and the thesis will explore options to address these difficulties...|$|R

All efforts devoted to this <b>peace</b> process are <b>obligation.</b> Influences of thoughts of Misbah bin Zainul Musthofa about s ulh for peace and conflict resolution in Indonesia are s ulh is to face splitting or disagreeing in opinion, s ulh is did with obeying the rules set by the government and s ulh is realized with dialogue and openness. Thoughts of s ulh of KH. Misbah bin Zainul Musthofa for peace and security in Indonesia have significant influence, especially in the northern coastal areas of the Java Island. This is caused by four things: firstly is the translation arrangements by Misbah are very much and can be accessed by the public. Secondly is emotional relationship that is built up between local leaders and its citizens based on the relationship of leaders (ulama) and their followers. Thirdly is scholars’ kinship networks in the form of family or students bonds. Finally is the scholars with their advantages and knowledge’s are seen as people who will always be able to understand the greatness of God and the secrets of nature in order that they are considered having unreachable position in society...|$|R

Today the Maze Prison/Long Kesh serves as more than a reminder of a dark era; it is also a hotly contested cultural landscape.
