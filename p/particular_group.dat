5|$|How species {{should be}} defined in a <b>particular</b> <b>group</b> of organisms gives rise to {{practical}} and theoretical problems that {{are referred to as}} the species problem. The scientific work of deciding how to define species has been called microtaxonomy. By extension, macrotaxonomy is the study of groups at higher taxonomic ranks, from subgenus and above only, than species.|$|E
5|$|Killer {{whales are}} highly social; some populations are {{composed}} of matrilineal family groups (pods) which are the most stable of any animal species. Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours, which are often specific to a <b>particular</b> <b>group</b> and passed across generations, {{have been described as}} manifestations of animal culture.|$|E

5|$|The middle belt of Nigeria {{is known}} for its {{diversity}} of ethnic groups, including the Pyem, Goemai, and Kofyar. The official population count of each of Nigeria's ethnicities has always remained controversial and disputed as members of different ethnic groups believe the census is rigged to give a <b>particular</b> <b>group</b> (usually believed to be northern groups) numerical superiority.|$|E

5|$|Aberdeen's {{supporters}}, {{known as}} the Red Army, {{are listed in the}} team squad list as wearing the number12 shirt. In 1999, a group of supporters founded the Red Ultras group with the express aim of improving the atmosphere at Pittodrie. However, it was decided that this <b>particular</b> <b>group</b> was to disband at the beginning of 2010.

5|$|Select {{committees}} are temporary committees, {{established by the}} Senate to deal with particular issues. This may occur when a <b>particular</b> <b>group</b> of Senators wishes to examine an issue in depth, or {{where there is no}} existing committee suited to addressing a particular topic. Australian Senate select committees have included ones set up to examine the Administration of Indigenous Affairs, and Mental Health. Select committees usually cease to exist upon reporting back to the chamber. One exception to this was the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation which in various forms existed for a decade.|$|E
5|$|The CLB {{directors}} concurred, and on January 19, 1920, {{they formed}} an organization {{under a new}} name, the American Civil Liberties Union. Although {{a handful of other}} organizations in the United States at that time focused on civil rights, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the ACLU was the first that did not represent a <b>particular</b> <b>group</b> of persons, or a single theme. Like the CLB, the NAACP pursued litigation to work on civil rights, including efforts to overturn the disfranchisement of African Americans in the South that had taken place {{since the turn of the}} century.|$|E
5|$|Primarily nocturnal, nursehounds {{spend the}} day inside small holes in rocks and swim into deeper water at night to hunt. Sometimes two sharks will squeeze into the same hole, and several {{individuals}} will seek out refuges within the same local area. In one tracking study, a single immature nursehound was observed to use five different refuges in succession {{over a period of}} 168 days, consistently returning to each one over a number of days before moving on. Nursehounds may occupy refuges to hide from predators, avoid harassment by mature conspecifics, and/or to facilitate thermoregulation. In captivity, these sharks are gregarious and tend to rest in groups, though the individuals comprising any <b>particular</b> <b>group</b> changes frequently. This species is less common than the small-spotted catshark.|$|E

25|$|The {{biggest problem}} with prosecuting Mengistu for {{genocide}} {{is that his}} actions did not necessarily target a <b>particular</b> <b>group.</b> They were directed against anybody who was opposing his government, and they were generally much more political than based on any ethnic targeting. In contrast, the irony is the Ethiopian government itself {{has been accused of}} genocide based on atrocities committed in Gambella. I'm not sure that they qualify as genocide either. But in Gambella, the incidents, which were well documented in a human rights report of about 2 years ago, were clearly directed at a <b>particular</b> <b>group,</b> the tribal group, the Anuak.|$|E

They contain especially rich artefacts, such as gold and silver jewelry.|$|E
25|$|One {{exception}} to {{the high level of}} patriotism was the Waxhaw settlement on the lower Catawba River along the North Carolina-South Carolina boundary, where Loyalism was strong. The area experienced two main settlement periods of Scotch-Irish. During the 1750s–1760s, second- and third-generation Scotch-Irish Americans moved from Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina. This <b>particular</b> <b>group</b> had large families, and as a group they produced goods for themselves and for others. They generally were Patriots.|$|E
