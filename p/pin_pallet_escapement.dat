50|$|The <b>pin</b> <b>pallet</b> <b>escapement</b> {{was widely}} {{used as it}} had many of the {{advantages}} of the lever escapement but was easier to manufacture. The pallets in a traditional lever escapement have two angled faces, the locking face and the impulse face, which engage the escape wheel teeth. They must be adjusted to precisely correct angles for the escapement to function. In the <b>pin</b> <b>pallet</b> <b>escapement</b> these faces are designed into the shape of the escape wheel teeth instead, eliminating the need for costly adjustments. However, the metal pins used instead of pallets have much higher friction than jewelled pallets, and combined with the looser manufacturing tolerances this made pin pallet timepieces less accurate. The metal pins also wear more quickly. Pin pallet timepieces are usually too cheap to justify repairing, and are usually thrown away when they break down or wear out.|$|E
50|$|From about 1860, key winding was {{replaced}} by keyless winding, where the watch was wound by turning the crown. The <b>pin</b> <b>pallet</b> <b>escapement,</b> an inexpensive version of the lever escapement invented in 1876 by Georges Frederic Roskopf was used in cheap mass-produced watches, which allowed ordinary workers to own a watch for the first time; other cheap watches used a simplified version of the duplex escapement, developed by Daniel Buck in the 1870s.|$|E

5000|$|Roskopf {{used the}} {{escapement}} in his visionary project to manufacture a 'laborer's watch', a pocket watch, which would sell {{for less than}} a week's wages of an unskilled laborer. The innovative Roskopf watch, which came out in 1876, won awards and was widely imitated, being made in various forms until about 1925. [...] In the USA, the escapement was used in cheap dollar watches. [...] It continued to be used in cheap wristwatches when they gained popularity after World War I. To keep costs down, pin-pallet watches usually didn't have any jeweled bearings, using plain steel bearings instead, although sometimes one jewel was incorporated for advertising purposes. An exception is Timex and Oris who in the 1960s produced fully jeweled pin-pallet watches. By 1980 inexpensive quartz watches took over the market for low-end watches which <b>pin</b> <b>pallet</b> watches had dominated, and production ceased. Quartz technology is gradually replacing the last uses of <b>pin</b> <b>pallet</b> movements in timers and alarm clocks.|$|R
50|$|Roskopf {{was granted}} US patent No. 75,463 10 Mar. 1868, for a {{changeable}} escapement for watches (this patent {{said that the}} escapement could be adapted for use with a cylinder or lever {{as well as a}} <b>pin</b> <b>pallet).</b> Roskopf patented his watch in France with French patent No. 80611 of 25 Mar. 1868 for a watch with a type of platform escapement. He patented his designs in several countries (Belgium, No. 21988, 3 Aug. 1867) but never in Switzerland, because Switzerland did not yet have a patenting system, and because the idea had been used there before his use of it.|$|R
50|$|An {{escapement}} is {{the mechanism}} in a mechanical timepiece {{that gives the}} balance wheel pushes to keep it moving back and forth, and releases the timepiece's gears to advance a fixed amount with each swing of the wheel, thus moving the hands forward at a steady rate. The <b>pin</b> <b>pallet</b> <b>escapement</b> {{is similar to the}} lever escapement, which is used in quality watches, except that the horizontal jewel pallets on the lever are replaced with vertical metal pins, and the shape of the escape wheel teeth is modified.|$|E
5000|$|The {{advantages}} of the lever are, first, {{that it is a}} [...] "detached" [...] escapement, it allows the balance wheel to swing completely free of the escapement during most of its oscillation, except when giving it a short impulse, improving timekeeping accuracy. Second, due to [...] "locking" [...] and [...] "draw" [...] its action is very precise. Third, it is self-starting, so if the watch is jarred in use so the balance wheel stops, it will start again. A cheaper and less accurate version of the lever escapement, called the <b>pin</b> <b>pallet</b> <b>escapement,</b> invented by Georges Frederic Roskopf in 1867, is used in clocks and timers.|$|E
50|$|A cheaper, less {{accurate}} {{version of}} the lever escapement is used in alarm clocks, kitchen timers, mantel clocks and, until the late 1970s, cheap watches, called the Roskopf, pin-lever, or pin-pallet escapement after Georges Frederic Roskopf, who invented it in 1867. It functions similarly to the lever, except that the lever pallet jewels are replaced by vertical metal pins. In a lever escapement, the pallets have two angled faces, the locking face and the impulse face, which must be carefully adjusted to the correct angles. In the <b>pin</b> <b>pallet</b> <b>escapement,</b> these two faces are designed {{into the shape of}} the escape wheel teeth instead, eliminating complicated adjustments. The pins are located symmetrically on the lever, making beat adjustment simpler. Watches that used these escapements were called pin lever watches, and have been superseded by cheap quartz watches.|$|E
5000|$|An {{escapement}} is {{a device}} in mechanical {{watches and clocks}} that transfers energy to the timekeeping element (the [...] "impulse action") and allows the number of its oscillations to be counted (the [...] "locking action"). The impulse action transfers energy to the clock's timekeeping element (usually a pendulum or balance wheel) to replace the energy lost to friction during its cycle and keep the timekeeper oscillating. The escapement is driven by force from a coiled spring or a suspended weight, transmitted through the timepiece's gear train. Each swing of the pendulum or balance wheel releases a tooth of the escapement's escape wheel gear, allowing the clock's gear train to advance or [...] "escape" [...] by a fixed amount. This regular periodic advancement moves the clock's hands forward at a steady rate. At {{the same time the}} tooth gives the timekeeping element a push, before another tooth catches on the <b>escapement's</b> <b>pallet,</b> returning the <b>escapement</b> to its [...] "locked" [...] state. The sudden stopping of the escapement's tooth is what generates the characteristic [...] "ticking" [...] sound heard in operating mechanical clocks and watches.|$|R
5000|$|The detent is a {{detached}} escapement; {{it allows the}} balance wheel to swing undisturbed during most of its cycle, except the brief impulse period, which is only given once per cycle (every other swing). [...] Because the driving escape wheel tooth moves almost parallel to the <b>pallet,</b> the <b>escapement</b> has little friction and did not need oiling. For these reasons among others the detent was considered the most accurate escapement for balance wheel timepieces. [...] John Arnold {{was the first to}} use the detent escapement with an overcoil balance spring (patented 1782) and with this improvement his watches were the first really accurate pocket timekeepers, keeping time to within 1 or 2 seconds per day. These were produced from 1783 onwards.|$|R
5000|$|Rather than <b>pallets,</b> the <b>escapement</b> uses a cutaway {{cylinder}} on {{the balance}} wheel shaft, which the escape teeth enter one by one. [...] Each wedge-shaped tooth impulses the balance wheel by pressure on the cylinder edge as it enters, is held inside the cylinder as it turns, and impulses the wheel again as it leaves out the other side. The wheel usually had 15 teeth, and impulsed the balance over an angle of 20° to 40° in each direction. [...] It is a frictional rest escapement, with the teeth {{in contact with the}} cylinder over the whole balance wheel cycle, and so was not as accurate as [...] "detached" [...] escapements like the lever, and the high friction forces caused excessive wear and necessitated more frequent cleaning.|$|R
50|$|The Riefler {{escape wheel}} and pallets {{are of a}} special design. There are {{actually}} two escape wheels mounted on the same shaft and two surfaces {{on each of the}} two <b>pallet</b> <b>pins.</b> The front locking wheel has forward pointing teeth rather like a dead-beat escapement, and catches on the flat surface of the pallet to lock the wheel. The rear impulse wheel has teeth with a sloping surface facing the direction of rotation. The round part of each pallet is acted upon by this surface to give the impulse.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new method for the signature analysis of mechanical watch movements. Contrary {{to the existing}} method, it analyzes the time-frequency features of mechanical watch movement {{through a combination of}} reassigned scalogram and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). By mapping the signal into a 2 D domain of time and frequency, the reassigned scalogram reveals the frequency components of the shocks at different time. On the other hand, FEA gives the modal frequencies of the movements. By comparing the frequency components at different shocks to the modal frequencies of the movement, possible malfunctions of the movement can then be detected. A number of demonstration examples are included.

As the intensity of the shocks in the drop phase is the largest, the vibration of the escape wheel may cause vibration on the fourth wheel. The instantaneous sound frequencies correspond to the modal frequencies of the vibrating parts, including the balance wheel, the pallet fork, the escape wheel and the fourth wheel.

50|$|The D shaped <b>pallets</b> of Harrison's <b>escapement</b> {{are both}} made of diamond, a {{considerable}} feat of manufacture at the time. For technical reasons {{the balance was}} made much larger than in a conventional watch of the period, and the vibrations controlled by a flat spiral steel spring. The movement also has centre seconds motion with a sweep seconds hand. The Third Wheel is equipped with internal teeth and has an elaborate bridge similar to the pierced and engraved bridge for the period. It runs at 5 beats (ticks) per second, and {{is equipped with a}} tiny remontoire. A balance-brake stops the watch half an hour before it is completely run down, in order that the remontoire does not run down also.Temperature compensation {{is in the form of}} a 'compensation curb' (or 'Thermometer Kirb' as Harrison called it). This takes the form of a bimetallic strip mounted on the regulating slide, and carrying the curb pins at the free end. During its initial testing, Harrison dispensed with this regulation using the slide, but left its indicating dial or figure piece in place.|$|R
