5|$|During {{his tenure}} as Prime Minister, and later President, Nasser {{continued}} the efforts to limit {{the power of the}} ulema of al-Azhar and to use its influence to his advantage. In 1952, the waqfs were nationalized and placed under the authority of the newly created Ministry of Religious Endowments, cutting off the ability of the mosque to control its financial affairs. He abolished the sharia courts, merging religious courts with the state judicial system in 1955, severely limiting the independence of the ulema. The 1961 reform law, which invalidated an earlier law passed in 1936 that had guaranteed the independence of al-Azhar, gave the President of Egypt the authority to appoint the sheikh al-Azhar, a position first created during Ottoman rule and chosen from and by the ulema since its inception. Al-Azhar, which remained a symbol of the Islamic character of both the nation and the state, continued to influence the population while being unable to exert its will over the state. Al-Azhar became increasingly co-opted into the state bureaucracy after the revolution—independence of its curriculum and its function as a mosque ceased. The authority of the ulema were further weakened by the creation of government agencies responsible for providing interpretations of religious laws. While these reforms dramatically curtailed the independence of the ulema, they also had the effect of reestablishing their influence by integrating them further into the state apparatus. The 1961 reform law also provided the ulema with the resources of the state, though the <b>purse</b> <b>strings</b> were outside of their control. While Nasser sought to subjugate the ulema beneath the state, he did not allow more extreme proposals to limit the influence of al-Azhar. One such proposal was made by Taha Hussein in 1955. Hussein sought to dismantle the Azharite primary and secondary educational system and transform the university into a faculty of theology which would be included within the modern, secular, collegiate educational system. The ulema opposed this plan, though Nasser's choice of maintaining al-Azhar's status was due more to personal political considerations, {{such as the use of}} al-Azhar to grant legitimacy to the regime, than on the opposition of the ulema.|$|E

40|$|SummarySingle {{cells and}} {{multicellular}} tissues rapidly heal wounds. These processes are considered distinct, but one mode of healing—Rho GTPase-dependent formation and closure of a <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> of actin filaments (F-actin) and myosin- 2 around wounds—occurs in single cells [1, 2] and in epithelia [3 – 10]. Here, {{we show that}} wounding of one cell in Xenopus embryos elicits Rho GTPase activation around the wound and at the nearest cell-cell junctions in the neighbor cells. F-actin and myosin- 2 accumulate at the junctions and around the wound itself, and as the resultant actomyosin array closes over the wound site, junctional F-actin and myosin- 2 become mechanically integrated with the actin and myosin- 2 around the wound, forming a hybrid <b>purse</b> <b>string.</b> When cells are ablated rather than wounded, Rho GTPase activation and F-actin accumulation occur at cell-cell junctions surrounding the ablated cell, and the <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> closes {{the hole in the}} epithelium. Elevation of intracellular free calcium, an essential upstream signal for the single-cell wound response [2, 11], also occurs at the cell-cell contacts and in neighbor cells. Thus, the single and multicellular <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> wound responses represent points on a signaling and mechanical continuum that are integrated by cell-cell junctions...|$|R

But as the campaign began operations, and began them on a huge scale, money was short. Hanna initially spent much of his time in New York, where many financiers were based.

Reports of Bryan support in the crucial Midwest, and intervention by Hanna's old schoolmate, John D. Rockefeller (his Standard Oil gave $250,000), made executives more willing to listen. After a gloomy August for the campaign's fundraising, in September, corporate moguls [...] "opened their <b>purse</b> <b>strings</b> to Hanna". J.P. Morgan gave $250,000.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Secure transluminal closure is {{the most}} {{fundamental}} prerequisite for the safe introduction of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). The aim was to compare acute strength of various gastrotomy closure techniques in an in vitro porcine stomach model by assessing leak pressures. METHODS: Standardized gastrotomies were closed manually, {{without the use of}} an endoscope, by one of seven NOTES closure devices: (i) T tags, (ii) <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> modified T tags, (iii) Eagle Claw VIII, (iv) Resolution clips, (v) flexible stapler; (vi) <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> suturing device, and (vii) flexible Endostitch. After closure, each specimen was fixed on the experimental apparatus and the pressure was gradually increased. By linking the pressure gauge and two cameras, the leak location and pressure could be determined in detail. We began by collecting gold standard reference values, by testing 15 gastrotomies closed with interrupted surgical sutures; these were associated with a mean leak pressure of 206 mmHg (SD 59). Using a noninferiority design, a sample size of 11 specimens for each NOTES closure technique was determined. RESULTS: The Resolution clips (P = 0. 0285), Eagle Claw VIII (P = 0. 0325), flexible stapler (P 0. 6775), <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> modified T tags (P > 0. 999), and the <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> suturing device (P = 0. 9875) resulted in inferior closures. CONCLUSIONS: The Eagle Claw VIII, Resolution clips, flexible stapler and flexible Endostitch produced noninferior closures in comparison with surgical closure in this model.

500|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Nicholas Exton's date of birth, youth or early years. He first appears in public records as having been elected as Member for Middlesex for the June 1369 parliament. By the early [...] 1380s he had become an [...] "active" [...] {{spokesman}} for the Fishmongers' Guild, {{of which he was}} a member. This, as the guild controlling the sale of a staple food, was immensely powerful in the politics of the City of London. At some point the King had appointed him a collector of the port's wool customs and subsidies, and he was also a Surveyor of Murage Mayor of the Westminster staple. These were all positions, comments one historian, [...] "close to the <b>purse</b> <b>strings</b> of the government and the city." [...] Also around the same time, he was elected alderman for Billingsgate Ward, which throughout his career he was to serve as on another seven occasions. Exton's guild was a particularly powerful one in the city politics of the day, and had a monopoly on the wholesale fish market; the then-current Mayor, John Northampton, who had a populist agenda was seemingly determined to break such monopolies and open London's markets up to the less-prosperous. Exton, perhaps [...] "naturally" [...] it has been said, joined Northampton's political opponents, chief of whom among them was the later Mayor Nicholas Brembre. Exton's advocacy for the Guild appears to have lead him to make robust and vigorous comments regarding his opponents, {{to the extent that it}} was noted in the 1382 Letter-Book that Exton had made [...] "opprobrious words used to the aforesaid mayor [...] "- for which it seems that Exton was removed from the office of alderman less than a week later (although he may have requested his own removal). At the same time he was deprived of his citizenship, imprisoned for a year, heavily fined and forced to leave the city, albeit temporarily. Only a month later, though, in September 1382, he was arguing the same points in parliament. The fishmongers (and by extension the other victualling guilds), stated Exton, were entitled to the same rights of exclusivity as other companies: [...] "If the retail in fish was to be thrown open to foreigners for the common good," [...] paraphrases one commentator on Exton's remarks, [...] "then so should all the others." [...] This line of argument provided Northampton's supporters the opportunity to claim that Exton was speaking in defiance of the traditional liberties of the city (and, therefore [...] "a manifest injury to all citizens" [...] as that year's Letter Book tells us).|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Time {{and again}} the {{technique}} of appendectomy for acute appendicitis has been debated, and optimal management of the stump is still a matter of discussion. Thus, a study was proposed to compare two techniques of management of the stump i. e., simple ligation alone vs. ligation and invagination of the stump with <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> sutures. Aim: To compare and evaluate simple ligation alone with ligation and invagination of the stump during appendectomy. Materials and Methods: A total of 102 patients were included in this study. Each patient was alternately divided under two groups (Group A: Simple ligation of the stump and Group B: Ligation and invagination of the stump with <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> sutures). The two techniques were compared with respect to duration, intra-operative and post-operative complications. Results: It was observed that simple ligation {{is not only an}} equally safe a procedure, but is also better in terms of duration of the procedure, which was seen to be less in the case of simple ligation alone.

40|$|The {{actomyosin}} <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> is an evolutionarily conserved contractile {{structure that}} {{is involved in}} cytokinesis, morphogenesis, and wound healing. Recent studies suggested that an actomyosin <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> is crucial for the closure of wounds in single cells. In the present study, morphological and pharmacological methods were used to investigate the role of this structure in the closure of wounds in the peripheral cytoplasm of sea urchin coelomocytes. These discoidal shaped cells underwent a dramatic form of actin-based centripetal/retrograde flow and occasionally opened and closed spontaneous wounds in their lamellipodia. Fluorescent phalloidin staining indicated that a well defined fringe of actin filaments assembles from the margin of these holes, and drug studies with cytochalasin D and latrunculin A indicated that actin polymerization is required for wound closure. Additional evidence that actin polymerization is involved in wound closure {{was provided by the}} localization of components of the Arp 2 / 3 complex to the wound margin. Significantly, myosin II immunolocalization demonstrated that it is not associated with wound margins despite being present in the perinuclear region. Pharmacological evidence for the lack of myosin II involvement in wound closure comes from experiments in which a microneedle was used to produce wounds in cells in which actomyosin contraction was inhibited by treatment with kinase inhibitors. Wounds produced in kinase inhibitor-treated cells closed {{in a manner similar to}} that seen with control cells. Taken together, our results suggest that an actomyosin <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> mechanism is not responsible for the closure of lamellar wounds in coelomocytes. We hypothesize that the wounds heal by means of a combination of the force produced by actin polymerization alone and centripetal flow. Interestingly, these cells did assemble an actomyosin structure around the margin of phagosome-like membrane invaginations, indicating that myosin is not simply excluded from the periphery by some general mechanism. The results indicate that the actomyosin <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> is not the only mechanism that can mediate wound closure in single cells...|$|R

40|$|Wound {{healing is}} {{essential}} in maintaining tissue integrity. Wounds can close via lamellipodial crawling, which involves the rapid migration of cell sheets.
