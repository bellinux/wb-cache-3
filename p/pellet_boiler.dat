5000|$|The Maine Fuels Board {{has spent}} {{nearly a year}} {{considering}} many of its solid fuel-related installation codes {{with the help of}} <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> practitioners.

50|$|The pellet fuel is {{delivered}} from the storage facility {{or the day}} tank (single stoves) into the combustion chamber. With the heat generated, circuit water is heated in the <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler.</b> In central heating systems the hot water then runs through the heating circuit. The heat distribution {{is the same as}} other central heating systems. Unlike oil or gas heating, the inclusion of a hot water reservoir is recommended with pellet heating systems to save hot water until it is needed.|$|E
50|$|Sub {{category}} of <b>pellet</b> systems are <b>boilers</b> or burners capable of burning pellet with higher ash rate (paper pellets, hay pellets, straw pellets). One {{of this kind}} is PETROJET pellet burner with rotating cylindrical burning chamber.In terms of efficiencies advanced <b>pellet</b> <b>boilers</b> can exceed other forms of biomass because of the more stable fuel charataristics. Advanced <b>pellet</b> <b>boilers</b> can even work in condensing mode and cool down combustion gases to 30-40 °C, instead of 120 °C before sent into the flue.|$|R
50|$|High-efficiency wood <b>pellet</b> stoves and <b>boilers</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} in recent years, typically offering combustion efficiencies of over 85%. The newest generation of wood <b>pellet</b> <b>boilers</b> can work in condensing mode and therefore achieve 12% higher efficiency values. Wood <b>pellet</b> <b>boilers</b> have limited control over the rate and presence of combustion compared to liquid or gaseous-fired systems; however, for this reason they are better suited for hydronic heating systems due to the hydronic system's greater ability to store heat. Pellet burners capable of being retrofitted to oil-burning boilers are also available.|$|R

5000|$|Much of Maine Energy Systems {{work to make}} wood pellet heating more {{prevalent}} in the Northeast has been with regulatory agencies. At the time MESys was founded very few regulations existed which directly referred to Wood Pellet boilers in Maine and the surrounding regions. As a result, rules and regulations created to regulate the installation and use of cordwood and coal stoker boilers were frequently applied to pellet boilers. Co-Owner Dr. Harry [...] "Dutch" [...] Dresser Jr. {{has been instrumental in}} helping to achieve parity in heating regulations between wood pellet heating appliances and conventional liquid and gaseous fuel appliances in some jurisdictions. Regulations which directly address wood pellet heat have existed for decades in various countries in Europe; the majority of new construction in Upper Austria is heated with wood pellet boilers. As wood pellet boilers gain use in the United States it is necessary that regulations be devised which directly address appropriate wood <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> use. Currently the lack of wood pellet fuel based appliance regulations requires regulatory agencies to hold wood pellet boilers to standards established for a different solid fuel source, such as cordwood, even though the manually fed operation of a cordwood boiler bears no resemblance to the operation of an automatic wood <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler.</b> Regulatory changes that have been made to directly address wood pellet boilers through Maine Energy Systems involvement include the following: ...|$|E
25|$|A {{problem with}} the {{combustion}} of solid biomass fuels is that it emits considerable amounts of pollutants, such as particulates and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

40|$|Interactions between {{anthropogenic}} and biogenic emissions, {{and implications}} for aerosol production, have raised particular scientific interest. Despite active research in this area, real anthropogenic emission sources have not been exploited for anthropogenic-biogenic interaction studies until now. This work examines these interactions using α-pinene and <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> emissions as a model test system. The impact of <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> emissions on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from α-pinene photo-oxidation was studied under atmospherically relevant conditions in an environmental chamber.

Results demonstrated that high NOx concentrations emitted by the <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> reduced SOA yields from α-pinene, whereas the chemical properties of the primary particles emitted by the <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> had no effect on observed SOA yields. The maximum SOA yield of α-pinene in the presence of <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> exhaust (under high-NOx conditions) was 18. 7 % and in the absence of <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> exhaust (under low-NOx conditions) was 34. 1 %. The reduced SOA yield under high-NOx conditions was caused by changes in gas-phase chemistry that led to the formation of organonitrate compounds...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{consumption}} of wood pellets as energy source for residential heating has increased, not only as fuel for stoves, but also for small-scale residential boilers that produce hot water used for both space heating and domestic hot water. Reduction of fuel consumption and pollutant emissions (CO, dust, HC) is an obvious target of wood <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> manufacturers, however they are also quite interested in producing low-maintenance appliances. The need of frequent maintenance turns in higher operating costs and inconvenience for the user, and in lower boiler efficiency and higher emissions also.

40|$|A wood pellet {{combustion}} {{carries out}} with high efficiency and comfort in modern <b>pellet</b> <b>boilers.</b> These facts help {{to increase the}} amount of installed <b>pellet</b> <b>boilers</b> in households. The combustion process quality depends besides the combustion conditions also on the fuel quality. The wood pellets, which don`t contain the bark and branches represent the highest quality. Because of growing pellet demand, an herbal biomass (phytomass), which is usually an agricultural by-product becomes economically attractive for pellet production. Although the phytomass has the net calorific value relatively slightly lower than the wood biomass, it is often significantly worse in view of the combustion process and an emission production. The combustion of phytomass pellets causes various difficulties in small heat sources, mainly due to a sintering of fuel residues. We want to avoid the ash sintering by a lowering of temperature in the combustion chamber below the ash sintering temperature of phytomass via the modification of a burner design. For research of the phytomass combustion process in the small boilers is constructed the experimental combustion device. There will investigate the impact of cooling intensity of the combustion chamber on the combustion process and emissions. Arising specific requirements from the measurement will be the basis for the design of the pellet burner and for the setting of operating parameters to the trouble-free phytomass combustion was guaranteed...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Biomass {{facilities}} have received increasing attention {{as a strategy}} to increase the use of renewable fuels and decrease greenhouse gas emissions from the electric generation and heating sectors, but these facilities can potentially increase local air pollution and associated health effects. Comparing the economic costs and public health benefits of alternative biomass fuel, heating technology, and pollution control technology options provides decision-makers with the necessary information to make optimal choices in a given location. METHODS: For {{a case study of}} a combined heat and power biomass facility in Syracuse, New York, we used stack testing to estimate emissions of fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) for both the deployed technology (staged combustion <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> with an electrostatic precipitator) and a conventional alternative (wood chip stoker boiler with a multicyclone). We used the atmospheric dispersion model AERMOD to calculate the contribution of either fuel-technology configuration to ambient primary PM 2. 5 in a 10 km x 10 km region surrounding the facility, and we quantified the incremental contribution to population mortality and morbidity. We assigned economic values to health outcomes and compared the health benefits of the lower-emitting technology with the incremental costs. RESULTS: In total, the incremental annualized cost of the lower-emitting <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> was $ 190, 000 greater, driven by a greater cost of the pellet fuel and pollution control technology, offset in part by reduced fuel storage costs. PM 2. 5 emissions were a factor of 23 lower with the <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> with electrostatic precipitator, with corresponding differences in contributions to ambient primary PM 2. 5 concentrations. The monetary value of the public health benefits of selecting the pellet-fired boiler technology with electrostatic precipitator was $ 1. 7 million annually, greatly exceeding the differential costs even when accounting for uncertainties. Our analyses also showed complex spatial patterns of health benefits given non-uniform age distributions and air pollution levels. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental investment in a lower-emitting staged combustion <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> with an electrostatic precipitator was well justified by the population health improvements over the conventional wood chip technology with a multicyclone, even given the focus on only primary PM 2. 5 within a small spatial domain. Our analytical framework could be generalized to other settings to inform optimal strategies for proposed new facilities or populations.
