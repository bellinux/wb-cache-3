Thirteen taxa of calyptrate flies belonging to four families were identified and classified according to the Mechanical Vector Risk Index (MVRI) value, which is proposed in this study. Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius, 1794), Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann, 1819), Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann, 1819), and Musca domestica Linnaeus, 1758 are of high risk; Fannia sp., Atherigona orientalis Schiner, 1868, and Ophyra aenescens (Wiedemann, 1830) of moderate risk; remaining species were classified as low or no risk.

40|$|Several {{immunological}} processes can {{be affected}} by space flight. However, {{there is little evidence}} to suggest that flight-induced immunological deficits lead to illness. Therefore, one of our goals has been to define models to examine host resistance during space flight. Our working hypothesis is that space flight crews will come from a heterogeneous population; the immune response gene make-up will be quite varied. It is unknown how much the immune response gene variation contributes to the potential threat from infectious organisms, allergic responses or other long term health problems (e. g. cancer).

40|$|<b>Pasteurella</b> <b>pneumotropica</b> {{can cause}} {{inflammation}} and abscess formation {{in a variety}} of tissues. Most commonly, P. pneumotropica produces clinical disease in immunodeficient mice or those concurrently infected with other pathogens. Because clinical disease is infrequent in immunocompetent mice harboring P. pneumotropica, some scientists consider it an opportunistic pathogen with little clinical relevance to biomedical research. However, other infectious agents, including mouse parvoviruses, mouse rotavirus, and Helicobacter spp. alter physiologic or biologic responses without causing clinical signs of illness. We investigated the potential for P. pneumotropica to modulate the transcription of cytokine genes in immunocompetent mice. In C 57 BL/ 6 mice inoculated oronasally with a minimal colonizing dose of P. pneumotropica, modest but statistically significant elevations of IL 1 β, TNFα, CCL 3, CXCL 1, and CXCL 2 mRNA were detected in mandibular and superficial cervical lymph nodes at 7 d after inoculation, and upregulation of IL 1 β mRNA was detected 28 d after inoculation. These perturbations were not present in C 57 /BL 6 mice inoculated with heat killed-P. pneumotropica or the related bacterium Actinobacillus muris. Nasal mucosal cytokine transcription did not vary significantly in C 57 BL/ 6 mice given a high dose of P. pneumotropica. These data indicate that slight and transient experimental perturbations are possible in immunocompetent mice colonized with P. pneumotropica.

The pnxI operon was organized according to {{the manner in which}} the genes encoded the structural RTX toxin (pnxIA), the type I secretion systems (pnxIB and pnxID), and the unknown orf. The pnxII gene was involved only with the pnxIIA that coded for a structural RTX toxin. Both the structural RTX toxins of deduced PnxIA and PnxIIA were involved in seven of the RTX repeat and repeat-like sequences. By quantitative PCR analysis of the structural RTX toxin-encoding genes in P. pneumotropica ATCC 35149, the gene expression of pnxIA was found to have increased from the early log phase, while that of pnxIIA increased from the late log to the early stationary phase. As expressed in Escherichia coli, both the recombinant proteins of PnxIA and PnxIIA showed weak hemolytic activity in both sheep and murine erythrocytes. On the basis of the results of the Southern blotting analysis, the pnxIA gene was detected in 82 % of the isolates, while the pnxIIA gene was detected in 39 %. These results indicate that the products of both pnxIA and pnxIIA were putative associations of virulence factors in the rodent pathogen P. pneumotropica...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Information {{regarding}} {{the prevalence of}} infectious agents in mice in pet shops in Japan is scarce. This information is particularly useful for minimizing the risk of potential transmission of infections to laboratory mice. Therefore, we surveyed infectious agents in mice from pet shops in Kanagawa and Tokyo, Japan. The survey was conducted in 28 mice from 5 pet shops to screen for 47 items (17 viruses, 22 bacteria and fungi, 10 parasites) using culture tests, serology, PCR, and microscopy. The most common viral agent detected was murine norovirus (17 mice; 60. 7 %), followed by Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (13 mice; 46. 4 %), and mouse hepatitis virus (12 mice; 42. 8 %). The most common agent amongst the bacteria and fungi was <b>Pasteurella</b> <b>pneumotropica</b> (10 mice; 35. 7 %), followed by Helicobacter ganmani and Pneumocystis murina (8 mice; 28. 5 %, for both). Tritrichomonas muris {{was the most common}} parasite (19 mice; 67. 8 %), followed by Spironucleus muris (13 mice; 46. 4 %), Aspiculuris tetraptera, and Syphacia obvelata (8 mice each; 28. 5 %). Remarkably, a zoonotic agent, Hymenolepis nana, was found in 7 mice (25 %). Given these results, we suggest that the workers in laboratory animal facilities should recognize again the potential risks of mice outside of the laboratory animal facilities as an infectious source, and avoid keeping mice as pets or as feed for carnivorous reptiles as much as possible for risk management...|$|E
40|$|Dominant idiotypes {{have been}} {{described}} in several different antigenic systems (1). Most dominant idiotypes are associated with immunoglobulins that are specific for bacterial antigens (for a summary see Table III). We have previously characterized a dominant idiotype, Id 460, that is produced in response to secondary immunization with 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl-ovalbumin (DNP-OVA) 1 in mice having appropriate genes encoding Igh-V and VK (2, 3). Similar to other dominant idiotypes (see Table III), Id 460 is also present in normal, preimmune mouse serum; however the normal serum Id 460 -positive immunoglobulin does not bind DNP (4). The high levels of Id 460 measured in normal sera from conventionally reared mice (4) suggested that the normal serum, non-DNP-binding Id 460, might be directed toward a commonly encountered environmental antigen. The lower levels of Id 460 detected in sera from germ-free mice supported this idea. To test this hypothesis, three previously described (4) Id 460 -positive non-DNPbinding monoclonal antibodies have been screened {{for their ability to}} agglutinate various bacterial isolates cultured from our mouse colony. Two of the monoclonal antibodies agglutinate an isolate of <b>Pasteurella</b> <b>pneumotropica</b> (Ppneumo), an opportunistic pathogen among the normal flora of mice (5), but no other bacteria that have been tested. Furthermore, Ppneumo not only induces an increase in serum Id 460 without increasing serum anti-DNP antibody but also absorbs the majority of Id 460 activity out of both normal, preimmune, and Ppneumo immune sera. Therefore, we propose that the Id 460 present in normal mous...|$|E
30|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} analyses of bacterial flora associated with pond water, gills, and intestine of polycultured healthy common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) {{were carried out}} and identified to species level where possible. Total viable bacterial counts in the pond water ranged from 9.2 [*]±[*] 5.5 [*]×[*] 103 to 6.6 [*]±[*] 5.1 [*]×[*] 104 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL; in the gill filaments of carp and catfish, 3.3 [*]±[*] 3.8 [*]×[*] 106 to 7.9 [*]±[*] 5.6 [*]×[*] 106 and 1.1 [*]±[*] 4.6 [*]×[*] 105 to 2.3 [*]±[*] 5.2 [*]×[*] 106 cfu/g, respectively; and in the intestine of carp and catfish, 1.4 [*]±[*] 2.9 [*]×[*] 1010 to 1.7 [*]±[*] 6.0 [*]×[*] 1011 and 2.7 [*]±[*] 3.4 [*]×[*] 1010 to 1.0 [*]±[*] 4.5 [*]×[*] 1011 cfu/g, respectively. Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria dominated the populations: 90 % in carp, 89 % in catfish, 80 % in water, and 86 % in the total populations. Altogether, 14 bacterial species of 10 genera were identified in total populations. Pond water bacteria had a reflection on the bacterial composition of the gills and intestine of carp and catfish. Aeromonas hydrophila, Shewanella putrefaciens, Vibrio cholerae, Staphylococcus sp., and Vibrio vulnificus appeared as the common bacteria in the populations, where the first three were highly significantly abundant (P[*]<[*] 0.0001). Moreover, A. hydrophila was the most significantly dominant bacteria (32 %; P[*]<[*] 0.005) among the total populations. Pantoea sp. and <b>Pasteurella</b> <b>pneumotropica</b> were present only in carp and catfish, respectively, but Corynebacterium urealyticum and Micrococcus sp. were present only in pond water.|$|E
