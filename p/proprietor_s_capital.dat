40|$|Systematic {{analysis}} of U. <b>S.</b> <b>capital</b> markets reveals important empirical facts that analytical modeling or empirical research seeking {{to explain the}} 1998 - 2001 movements needs to recognize. There is no single "bubble point" at which U. <b>S.</b> <b>capital</b> markets had an epiphany that valuations required a sharp downward re-evaluation. Rather, different sectors had different points after which ex post sustained declines occurred. For the NASDAQ/NYSE/AMEX public capital markets, the sustained ex post declines occurred starting in March 2000 for the computer software industry and in September 2000 for the computer hardware industry. Private venture capital investment in new ventures peaked in the March 2000 quarter for software and in the September 2000 quarter for hardware and communications. Four sectors exhibiting extreme price movements are identified - computer hardware, computer software, telecommunications, and biotech/pharmaceuticals. These sectors had observable characteristics prior to 1998 that implied higher risk - they had higher relative risk (CAPM beta), higher standard deviation of security returns, more extreme revenue growth increases (decreases) in the upper (lower) tails, and a higher propensity for negative net income. During the 1998 - 2001 period, companies in these sectors had abnormally high revenue growth rates. An Internet sample of companies exhibits even higher abnormal revenue growth rates relative to either prior periods or other companies in the 1998 - 2001 period. The large relative increases and decreases in the market capitalization of U. <b>S.</b> <b>capital</b> markets in 1998 - 2001 may well have more grounding in risk-reward asset pricing theory than many commentators have recognized. capital markets; stock prices; Internet stocks; stock market bubble;...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{intervention}} of Building Information Modeling (BIM) on the efficiency losses in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>capital</b> facilities industry. BIM is an intelligent parametric, object-based design methodology that is compelling the design community to transition away from unintelligent nonparametric, computer-aided drafting (CAD) processes. In 2004, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) commissioned the report, Cost Analysis of Inadequate Interoperability in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Capital</b> Facilities Industry. The report illustrates a $ 15, 800, 000, 000 USD (€ 11, 600, 000, 000 EUR) annual efficiency losses generated from process waste in 2002. The NIST attributes the waste to the inadequate operability between CAD technologies, engineering, and software systems. The report relies on statistics compiled from nonparametric processes that the NIST measures against a counterfactual scenario. The author’s purpose is to explore how a parametric database methodology enhances interoperability in the building sector by approaching the ideal hypothetical. The author performs the qualitative study in the artifact analysis tradition. The results indicate that BIM provides the infrastructure for improved interoperability, but does not longitudinally connect all stakeholders in terms of life cycle costing and has areas of inadequate interoperability...|$|R

40|$|China 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>capital</b> account {{convertibility}} {{is presently}} not well understood. A relatively closed de jure regime sits {{in contrast with}} a de facto regime that exhibits distinct signs of being quite open. This paper seeks {{to shed light on}} this issue by using an econometric model to predict the level of capital flows that would be expected if China had a fully open capital account. The results show that over 2001 - 2003, observed capital flows were around 85 percent of the predicted value, suggesting that China 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>capital</b> account over a one year time horizon is already quite open. Short run convertibility would expectedly be less than this figure. Thus, the results carry the connotation that the cost of capital controls in terms of allocative inefficiency over the medium and long run is likely to have been modest while some unwarranted short run volatility has been avoided. Nonetheless, the results do not leave room for policy complacency. As China continues to implement its WTO commitments in addition to other arrangements such as the Common Economic Partnership Agreement with Hong Kong, short run convertibility is presently on the rise. This makes implementing policies that are prerequisites for full convertibility a matter of urgency...|$|R
40|$|In a 1989 {{article in}} this Review, John K.

To reach that conclusion, he assumed that rising U. <b>S.</b> <b>capital</b> outflows could be absorbed by the rest of the world without a decline in real interest rates. In this article, he considers the reasonableness of that assumption and reevaluates the accuracy of his earlier projections.; Hill first examines the demographics of other major countries to see if they could support a rapid turnaround in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>capital</b> account. The results are decidedly negative. An analysis of capital flows based on demographic conditions in the United States, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom suggests that the United States could remain a net capital importer throughout this decade and into the early part of the next century. Despite these findings, Hill continues to support his earlier projections. He argues that new capital demands of former Communist and developing countries will help prevent a slide in interest rates and raise the international investment positions of all industrialized countries, including the United States.
