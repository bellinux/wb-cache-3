5|$|The two-story brick {{structure}} {{is supported by}} a fieldstone foundation and still features its original front <b>porch.</b> The <b>porch</b> spans the length of the building's front (south) facade, at a height of about 6feet (1.8m). The <b>porch</b> is supported by four wooden pillars, which rest on stone bases. The stairs leading to the front <b>porch</b> are supported by two similar wooden posts, which, like the house, are set into fieldstone bases.

5000|$|<b>Porches</b> Pottery (Olaria Algarve) Katherine {{had been}} around and {{involved}} with the pottery her father founded, <b>Porches</b> Pottery, from its inception.
