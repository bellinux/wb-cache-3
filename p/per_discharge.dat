Further, average hospital costs, or cost <b>per</b> <b>discharge,</b> increased at least 2% for all hospitalizations and were expected to grow by at least 4% through 2013. The exception to this was mental health hospitalizations, which saw a lower percentage increase of 1.2%, and was projected to increase only 0.9% through 2013. Despite the rising aggregate costs and costs <b>per</b> <b>discharge,</b> hospitalizations (except for mental health hospitalizations) for children aged 0-17 decreased over the same time, and were projected to continue decreasing.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the Gatling gun, {{the only}} weapons {{available}} to military forces capable of firing many projectiles {{in a short}} space of time were mass-firing volley weapons, like the Belgian and French mitrailleuse of the 1860s and 1870s, and field cannons firing canister shot, much like an upsized shotgun. The latter were widely used {{during and after the}} Napoleonic Wars. Although the maximum rate of fire was increased by firing multiple projectiles simultaneously, these weapons still needed to be reloaded after each discharge, which for multi-barrel systems like the mitrailleuse was cumbersome and time-consuming.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE - Past studies {{consistently}} show {{an inverse}} relationship between physicians' surgical procedures/diagnoses volume and cost. There is little information available on this aspect of stroke care. We used nationwide population-based data to explore the association between physician case volume and costs <b>per</b> <b>discharge</b> for patients with stroke. METHODS - Data on all 83 748 hospitalizations for stroke in 2004, treated by 3757 physicians in Taiwan, from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, was analyzed using hierarchical linear regression modeling to explore associations between costs <b>per</b> <b>discharge</b> and physician case volume (one to 44 cases=low volume, 44 to 135 =medium volume, ≥ 136 cases=high volume) adjusting for patient's age, gender, comorbidities, and stroke type; hospital ownership, teaching status, and geographic region; and physician demographics. RESULTS - Unadjusted mean cost <b>per</b> <b>discharge</b> was highest for patients treated by low-volume physicians, at NT $ 79 993 compared with NT $ 78 588 for medium-volume physicians and NT $ 43 942 for high-volume physicians (P< 0. 001). Adjusted for patient, hospital, and physician variables, low-volume physicians had a mean case cost of NT $ 27 729 higher than high-volume physicians (P= 0. 001) and NT $ 7761 higher than medium-volume physicians (P= 0. 027). CONCLUSIONS - Our data confirm an inverse volume-cost relationship for stroke care in Taiwan. After adjusting for patient, hospital, and physician characteristics, the potential cost savings if all patients were treated or supervised by high-volume physicians could be 41. 0 % of the mean treatment cost incurred by low-volume physicians. © 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mounting {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} laparoscopic techniques {{for the treatment of}} simple appendicitis. However, most of the advantages of these techniques are of limited clinical relevance. This study compares the treatment outcomes of laparoscopic appendectomies and open appendectomies performed in Taiwan. METHODS: This study uses data from the 2007 to 2009 Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The study sample included 65, 339 patients, hospitalized with a discharge diagnosis of acute appendicitis (33. 8 % underwent laparoscopic appendectomy). A generalized estimated equation (GEE) was performed to explore the relationship between the use of laparoscopy and 30 -day re-admission. Hierarchical linear regressions were performed {{to examine the relationship between}} the use of laparoscopy, the length of stay (LOS), and the cost <b>per</b> <b>discharge.</b> RESULTS: A significantly lower proportion of patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomies were re-admitted within 30 days of their index appendectomy, in comparison to patients undergoing open appendectomies (0. 66 % versus 1. 925, p< 0. 001). Compared with patients undergoing open appendectomies, patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomies had a shorter LOS (4. 01 versus 5. 33 days, p< 0. 001) and a higher cost <b>per</b> <b>discharge</b> (NT$ 40, 554 versus NT$ 38, 509, p< 0. 001. In 2007, the average exchange rate was US$ 1 =NT$ 31. 0). GEE revealed that the odds ratio of 30 -day readmission for patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy was 0. 38 (95 % CI= 0. 33 - 0. 46) that of patients undergoing open appendectomies, after adjusting for surgeon, hospital, and patient characteristics, as well as for the clustering effect of particular surgeons and the propensity score.

40|$|Background/Objectives:Intravenous (i. v.) {{glutamine}} supplementation of {{parenteral nutrition}} (PN) can improve clinical outcomes, reduce mortality and infection rates and shorten {{the length of}} hospital and/or intensive care unit (ICU) stays compared with standard PN. This study is a pharmacoeconomic analysis to determine whether i. v. glutamine supplementation of PN remains both a highly favourable and cost-effective option for Italian ICU patients. Subjects/Methods:A previously published discrete event simulation model was updated by incorporating the most up-to-date and clinically relevant efficacy data (a clinically realistic subgroup analysis from a published meta-analysis), recent cost data from the Italian health-care system and the latest epidemiology data from a large Italian ICU database (covering 230 Italian ICUs and more than 77 [*] 000 patients). Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. Results:Parenteral glutamine supplementation can significantly improve ICU efficiency in Italy, as the additional cost of supplemented treatment is more than completely offset by cost savings in hospital care. Supplementation was more cost-effective (cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) =[euro] 35 [*] 165 <b>per</b> patient <b>discharged</b> alive) than standard, non-supplemented PN (CER=[euro] 40 [*] 156 <b>per</b> patient <b>discharged</b> alive), and it resulted in mean cost savings of [euro] 4991 <b>per</b> patient <b>discharged</b> alive or [euro] 1047 per patient admitted to the hospital.

METHOD: The development of a nine-step evaluation framework: 1. Identification of multiple endpoints and arranging them into manageable groups; 2. Estimation of baseline overall and preventable risk; 3. Bayesian elicitation of expected effectiveness of the planned intervention; 4. Assigning utilities to groups of endpoints; 5. Costing the intervention; 6. Estimating health service costs associated with preventable adverse events; 7. Calculating health benefits; 8. Cost-effectiveness calculation; 9. Sensitivity and headroom analysis. RESULTS: Literature review suggested that adverse events follow 19 % of patient discharges, and that one-third are preventable by improved handover (ie, 6. 3 % of all discharges). The intervention to improve handover would reduce the incidence of adverse events by 21 % (ie, from 6. 3 % to 4. 7 %) according to the elicitation exercise. Potentially preventable adverse events were classified by severity and duration. Utilities were assigned to each category of adverse event. The costs associated with each category of event were obtained from the literature. The unit cost of the intervention was € 16. 6, which would yield a Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gain <b>per</b> <b>discharge</b> of 0. 010.

40|$|Background. Antimicrobial {{stewardship}} {{programs are}} advised to measure and risk-adjust antimicrobial use to facilitate interhospital comparisons, a process called benchmarking. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate a new benchmarking strategy for antibacterials. Methods. Hospital-wide adult antibacterial drug use in 2009 was measured as days of therapy (DOT) and length of therapy (LOT) from billing records in 70 US academic medical centers (AMCs). Patients were assigned to 1 of 35 clinical service lines (CSL) based on their Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group. Expected (E) use was determined by indirect standardization and compared with observed (O) use. Results. Of 1 791 180 discharged adults, 63. 7 % received antibacterial drugs; the range by CSL was 14. 3 % (psychiatry) to 99. 7 % (lung transplant). Mean 6 SD hospital-wide use was 8396 106 DOTs (range, 594 – 1109) and 536 6 53. 0 LOT (range, 427 – 684) per 1000 patient-days. The ventilator support CSL had the most DOT <b>per</b> <b>discharge,</b> 39. 46 9. 4 days; the LOT was 21. 56 4. 5 days.

During normal operation on DIII-D dust observation rates are low, a few events <b>per</b> <b>discharge</b> or less. The net carbon content of the dust corresponds to a carbon atom density a few orders of magnitude below the core impurity density. Statistical analysis of Mie data collected over months of operation reveal correlation of increased dust rate with increased heating power and impulsive wall loading due to edge localized modes (ELMs) and disruptions. Generation of significant amounts of dust by disruptions is confirmed by the camera data. However, dust production by disruptions alone is insufficient to account for estimated in-vessel dust inventory in DIII-D. After an extended entry vent, thousands of dust particles are observed by cameras in the first 2 - 3 plasma discharges. Individual particles moving at velocities up to {approx} 300 m/s, breakup of larger particles into pieces, and collisions of particles with walls are observed. After {approx} 70 discharges, dust levels are reduced to a few events <b>per</b> <b>discharge.</b> In order to calibrate diagnostics and benchmark modeling, milligram amounts of micron-sized carbon dust have been injected into DIII-D discharges, leading to the core carbon density increase {{by a factor of}} 2 - 3. Following injection, dust trajectories in the divertor are mostly in the toroidal direction, consistent with the ion drag force. Dust from the injection is observed in the outboard midplane by a fast framing camera. The observed trajectories and velocities of the dust particles are in qualitative agreement with modeling by the 3 D DustT code...|$|E
40|$|Minimally {{invasive}} {{approaches have}} dramatically reduced morbidity associated with adrenalectomy. There has been concern that an increased frequency of adrenal imaging {{along with the}} advantages of less morbidity could influence the indications for adrenalectomy. We tested the hypothesis that adrenalectomy has become more common over time and that benign diseases have been increasingly represented among procedural indications. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was utilized to determine the incidence of adrenalectomy and the associated surgical indications in the United States between 1988 and 2000. All discharged patients were identified whose primary ICD- 9 -CM procedure code was for adrenalectomy, regardless of the specific surgical approach (laparoscopic adrenalectomy was not reliably coded). This subset was then queried for associated ICD- 9 -CM diagnostic codes. Linear regression and t -tests were utilized to determine the significance of trends. The total number of adrenalectomies increased significantly, from 12. 9 <b>per</b> 100, 000 <b>discharges</b> in 1988 to 18. 5 <b>per</b> 100, 000 <b>discharges</b> in 2000 (p = 0. 000003). The total number of adrenalectomies with a primary ICD- 9 -CM code for malignant adrenal neoplasm did not increase significantly: from 1. 2 <b>per</b> 100, 000 <b>discharges</b> in 1988 to 1. 6 <b>per</b> 100, 000 <b>discharges</b> in 2000 (p = 0. 47). The total number of adrenalectomies with a primary ICD- 9 -CM diagnostic code for benign adrenal neoplasm increased significantly, from 2. 8 <b>per</b> 100, 000 <b>discharges</b> in 1988 to 4. 8 <b>per</b> 100, 000 <b>discharges</b> in 2000 (p = 0. 00002). The average percentage of adrenalectomies performed for malignant neoplasm was significantly higher during the period 1988 – 1993 when compared to 1994 – 2000 (11 % vs. 9 %; p = 0. 002). The average percentage of adrenalectomies performed for benign neoplasm was significantly lower during 1988 – 1993 when compared to 1994 – 2000 (25 % vs. 28 %; p = 0. 015). Adrenalectomy is being performed with increasing frequency. This is associated {{with an increase in}} the proportion of adrenalectomies performed for benign neoplasms. Assuming no significant change in disease prevalence during the study period, these data suggest that indications for adrenalectomy may have changed somewhat over that period...|$|R
