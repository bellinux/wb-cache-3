5|$|The {{origins of}} the composition, techniques, layout, and style of Delian mosaics {{can be found in}} 5th-century BC <b>pebble</b> mosaics of Olynthus in the Chalcidice of {{northern}} Greece, with mosaics positioned in the center of cement floors and utilizing garland, meander, and wave patterns around a centralized motif or figured scene. This design scheme {{is similar to that of}} 4th-century BC mosaics of Pella in Macedonia, although the <b>pebble</b> mosaics there employ a wider range of colors to create the effects of volume. The transition from <b>pebble</b> mosaics to more complex tessellated mosaics perhaps originated in Hellenistic-Greek Sicily during the 3rd century BC, developed at sites such as Morgantina and Syracuse. Much like Olynthus, mosaics of Morgantina contain the garland, wave, and meander patterns, although the latter was finally executed with perspective.|$|E

40|$|Given a {{configuration}} of <b>pebbles</b> on the vertices of a connected graph G, a <b>pebbling</b> move {{is defined as}} the removal of two <b>pebbles</b> from some vertex, and the placement of one of these on an adjacent vertex. We introduce the notion of domination cover <b>pebbling,</b> obtained by combining graph cover <b>pebbling</b> ([2]) with the theory of domination in graphs ([3]). The domination cover <b>pebbling</b> number, ψ(G), of a graph G is the minimum number of <b>pebbles</b> that are placed on V (G) such 1 that after a sequence of <b>pebbling</b> moves, the set of vertices with <b>pebbles</b> forms a dominating set of G, regardless of the initial {{configuration of}} <b>pebbles.</b> We discuss basic results and determine ψ(G) for paths, cycles and complete binary trees. ...|$|R

5|$|The Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), {{also called}} the white {{scavenger}} vulture or pharaoh's chicken, is a small Old World vulture and {{the only member of}} the genus Neophron. It is widely distributed; the Egyptian vulture is found from southwestern Europe and northern Africa to India. The contrasting underwing pattern and wedge-shaped tail make it distinctive in flight as it soars in thermals during the warmer parts of the day. Egyptian vultures feed mainly on carrion but are opportunistic and will prey on small mammals, birds, and reptiles. They also feed on the eggs of other birds, breaking larger ones by tossing a large <b>pebble</b> onto them. The use of tools is rare in birds and apart from the use of a <b>pebble</b> as a hammer, Egyptian vultures also use twigs to roll up wool for use in their nest. Egyptian vultures that breed in the temperate regions migrate south in winter while tropical populations are relatively sedentary. Populations of this species have declined in the 20th century and some island populations are endangered by hunting, accidental poisoning, and collision with power lines.|$|E
