5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Reyes and her fellow agents investigate a serial killer who uses numerology to choose his victims. Soon, Reyes and Scully meet an unusual man who may <b>prove</b> <b>more</b> of a hindrance than a help.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer might consider a replicator {{of a certain}} idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves <b>prove</b> <b>more</b> or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E
5|$|Egbert's conquests {{brought him}} wealth {{far greater than}} his {{predecessors}} had enjoyed, and enabled him to purchase the support which secured the West Saxon throne for his descendants. The stability brought by the dynastic succession of Egbert and Æthelwulf led to an expansion of commercial and agrarian resources, and to an expansion of royal income. The wealth of the West Saxon kings was also increased by the agreement in 838–39 with Archbishop Ceolnoth for the previously independent West Saxon minsters to accept the king as their secular lord in return for his protection. However, there was no certainty that the hegemony of Wessex would <b>prove</b> <b>more</b> permanent than that of Mercia.|$|E

5|$|The {{player has}} a full, {{360-degree}} field of view, and can quickly look left, right, forward, {{and behind the}} dragon. Enemies come from all directions, varying in size and health, and also appear on an on-screen radar that monitors the dragon's surroundings. Two weapons are available: the rider's handgun, which can be fired with a single button press when an enemy enters the aiming reticle, and the homing laser fired by the dragon, which can lock on up to eight enemies by moving the reticle over them while holding down the fire button. Some situations with many enemies on screen {{require the use of}} the lock-on laser, while in others, quick gunshots to weak spots will <b>prove</b> <b>more</b> efficient.|$|E

25|$|The Vestbane line may {{easily be}} {{extended}} from Høje Taastrup to Roskilde, since tracks already exist, {{and this has}} been discussed on several occasions.

25|$|In July 2003, the Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress {{stated that}} Khadr's last known {{whereabouts}} were in Afghanistan in November 2001. Meanwhile, Khadr {{was asked to}} organise militants operating near the border of Shagai, Pakistan, and subsequently asked his son Abdullah and Hamza al-Jowfi to help him procure weapons. He clashed with Abdul Hadi al Iraqi, arguing that guerilla tactics would <b>prove</b> <b>more</b> useful than front line battle.|$|E
25|$|Drugs {{that may}} <b>prove</b> <b>more</b> {{effective}} and safer than benzodiazepines for insomnia {{is an area}} of active research. Nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic drugs, such as zolpidem (Ambien), zaleplon, zopiclone (Imovane), and eszopiclone (Lunesta), are a class of hypnotic medications that are similar to benzodiazepines in their mechanism of action, and indicated for mild to moderate insomnia. Their effectiveness at improving time to sleeping is slight, and they have similar—though potentially less severe—side effect profiles compared to benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|The post-war {{period was}} to <b>prove</b> <b>more</b> {{challenging}} for the LBSCR {{with the national}} railway strike in 1919, followed by two coalminers' strikes in 1920 and 1921 which resulted in reduced levels of service far worse than anything seen during the war. Problems were also experienced with the Oxted Tunnel south of Woldingham which led to services being diverted through the Three Bridges Line. It was only in 1922 that services began to creep back to their pre-war levels.|$|E

25|$|Lyal S. Sunga. In 2009, Professor Sunga {{argued that}} a concept of human {{security}} that is fully informed by international human rights law, international humanitarian law, international criminal law and international refugee law, and which {{takes into account the}} relevant international legal norms prohibiting {{the use of force in}} international relations, will likely <b>prove</b> <b>more</b> valuable to international legal theory and practice over the longer term, than a concept of human security which does not meet these conditions because these fields of law represent the objectified political will of States rather than the more subjective biases of scholars.|$|E
25|$|Leven Shreve, a Louisville civic leader, {{became the}} first {{president}} of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L), which was to <b>prove</b> <b>more</b> important for trade. It led to the developing western states and linked with Mississippi River traffic. With the railroads, Louisville could manufacture furniture and other goods, and export products to Southern cities. Louisville {{was on her way to}} becoming an industrial city. The Louisville Rolling Mill built girders and rails, and other factories made cotton machinery, which was sold to Southern customers. Louisville built steamboats. Louisville emerged with an iron-working industry; the plant at Tenth and Main was called Ainslie, Cochran, and Company.|$|E
25|$|South Beach, {{along with}} a handful of other neighborhoods in Greater Miami (such as Downtown and Brickell), is one of the areas where a car-free {{lifestyle}} is commonplace. Many South Beach residents get around by foot, bicycle, motorcycle, bus or by taxi, as the neighborhood is very urban, and pedestrian-friendly. Automobile congestion in the area is frequent, so getting around in South Beach by car can often <b>prove</b> <b>more</b> difficult than simply walking. Recently, Miami Beach has begun bicycle initiaves promoting citywide bike parking and bike lanes, that have made bicycling much more popular for residents and tourists. The Venetian Causeway for example, is a popular bicycle commuter route that connects South Beach to Downtown.|$|E

25|$|News of {{the conference}} leaked and Tory churchmen were shocked that Rochester might have wavered in his faith. Rochester {{requested}} another conference and James consented. Rochester {{let it be known}} to influential Catholics at court that he would do everything they requested (except convert) so long as he remained in office. He told them that as a Protestant he would <b>prove</b> <b>more</b> useful to them than as a Catholic. However, on 17 December James called Rochester into an audience and told him that so high an office of Lord Treasurer could not be held by a staunch Anglican under a Catholic monarch. James asked him to think again on his refusal to convert but Rochester would not and on 4 January 1687 he was dismissed. However he received a pension of approximately £4000 per annum and £40,000 and estates from a convicted traitor.|$|E
25|$|His {{controversial}} {{reassessment of}} global warming theory in 2009 outlined his concern that the remedies for climate change might <b>prove</b> <b>more</b> damaging to the environment than the ailment itself. Taylor argued that his work with the CRI {{had given him a}} deeper insight into the impacts associated with powering a modern economy from renewable sources. Despite an endorsement by the drafting author of the Kyoto Protocol – Professor Jackson Davis, with whom he worked at the UN and who had played a role in setting up the Framework Climate Convention, the book received little publicity at first – but in the lead up to the Copenhagen summit, his views were widely publicized. However, Taylor is critical of how the environmental movement and left-liberal press have ignored the book - it was not reviewed in The Guardian, The Independent, The Observer, nor in New Scientist, all of which had previously covered his work. He has become a target of ad hominem attacks focussed either on whether he is adequately qualified to review climate science or on his embrace of mystical philosophy and shamanism.|$|E
25|$|Although Sumter was a masonry fort, {{there were}} wooden {{buildings}} inside for barracks and officer quarters. The Confederates targeted these with Heated shot (cannonballs heated red hot in a furnace), starting fires that could <b>prove</b> <b>more</b> {{dangerous to the}} men than explosive artillery shells. At 7 p.m. on April 12, a rain shower extinguished the flames {{and at the same}} time the Union gunners stopped firing for the night. They slept fitfully, concerned about a potential infantry assault against the fort. During the darkness, the Confederates reduced their fire to four shots each hour. The following morning, the full bombardment resumed and the Confederates continued firing hot shot against the wooden buildings. By noon most of the wooden buildings in the fort and the main gate were on fire. The flames moved toward the main ammunition magazine, where 300 barrels of gunpowder were stored. The Union soldiers frantically tried to move the barrels to safety, but two-thirds were left when Anderson judged it was too dangerous and ordered the magazine doors closed. He ordered the remaining barrels thrown into the sea, but the tide kept floating them back together into groups, some of which were ignited by incoming artillery rounds. He also ordered his crews to redouble their efforts at firing, but the Confederates did the same, firing the hot shots almost exclusively. Many of the Confederate soldiers admired the courage and determination of the Yankees. When the fort had to pause its firing, the Confederates often cheered and applauded after the firing resumed and they shouted epithets at some of the nearby Union ships for failing to come to the fort's aid.|$|E
