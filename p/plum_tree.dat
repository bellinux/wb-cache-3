500|$|... "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] is {{a poem by}} John Keats written {{either in}} the garden of the Spaniards Inn, Hampstead, London or, {{according}} to Keats' friend Charles Armitage Brown, under a <b>plum</b> <b>tree</b> {{in the garden of}} Keats' house at [...] Wentworth Place, also in Hampstead. According to Brown, a nightingale had built its nest near the house Keats and Brown shared in the spring of 1819. Inspired by the bird's song, Keats composed the poem in one day. It soon became one of his 1819 odes and was first published in Annals of the Fine Arts the following July. The poem {{is one of the most}} frequently anthologized in the English language.|$|E
500|$|Of Keats's {{six major}} odes of 1819, [...] "Ode to Psyche", was {{probably}} written first and [...] "To Autumn" [...] written last. Sometime between these two, he wrote [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". It {{is possible that}} [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] was written between 26 April and 18 May 1819, based on weather conditions and similarities between images in the poem and those in a letter sent to Fanny Brawne on May Day. The poem was composed at the Hampstead house Keats shared with Brown, possibly while sitting beneath a <b>plum</b> <b>tree</b> in the garden. According to Keats' friend Brown, Keats finished the ode in just one morning: [...] "In the spring of 1819 a nightingale had built her nest near my house. Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song; and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast-table to the grass-plot under a plum-tree, where he sat {{for two or three}} hours. When he came into the house, I perceived he had some scraps of paper in his hand, and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books. On inquiry, I found those scraps, four or five in number, contained his poetic feelings on the song of the nightingale." [...] Brown's account is personal, as he claimed the poem was directly influenced by his house and preserved by his own doing. However, Keats relied on both his own imagination and other literature as sources for his depiction of the nightingale.|$|E
