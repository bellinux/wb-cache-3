5|$|Anthropologists {{are also}} able to see other markers present on the bones. Past {{fractures}} will be evident {{by the presence of}} bone remodeling. The examination of any fractures on the bones can potentially help determine cause of death as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before death), peri-mortem (at the time of death), or <b>post-mortem</b> (after death). Ante-mortem fractures will show signs of healing while peri- and <b>post-mortem</b> fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean while <b>post-mortem</b> breaks will appear brittle. Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in bone marrow samples and can help narrow down the list of possible identifications.|$|E

Shorrock and Swift agreed with the results of the second autopsy. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, told the pathologists before the final <b>post-mortem</b> that Tomlinson had fallen to {{the ground in front of}} a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence that this had happened. The IPCC ruled in May 2011 that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead.|$|E
