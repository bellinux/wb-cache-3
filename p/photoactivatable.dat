These include <b>photoactivatable</b> CRISPR systems developed by fusing light-responsive protein partners with an activator domain and a dCas9 for gene activation, or fusing similar light responsive domains with two constructs of split-Cas9, or by incorporating caged unnatural amino acids into Cas9, or by modifying the guide RNAs with photocleavable complements for genome editing.|$|E
50|$|The <b>photoactivatable</b> group {{provides}} nonspecific {{labeling of}} proteins, DNA and RNA probes or other molecules. Biotinylation of DNA and RNA with <b>photoactivatable</b> biotin is easier {{and less expensive}} than enzymatic methods since the DNA and RNA does not degrade.

50|$|Proteins which {{sense and}} react to light were {{originally}} isolated from photoreceptors in algae, corals and other marine organisms. The two {{most commonly used}} <b>photoactivatable</b> proteins in science today are <b>photoactivatable</b> fluorescent proteins and retinylidene proteins. <b>Photoactivatable</b> fluorescent proteins change to longer emission wavelength upon illumination with UV light. In Kaede, this change is brought upon by cleavage of the chomophore tripeptide His62-Tyr63-Gly64. This discovery {{paved the way for}} modern super resolution microscopy techniques like PALM or STORM. Retinylidene proteins such as Channelrhodopsins or Halorhodopsins are light sensitive cation and chloride channels, which open during illumination with blue and yellow light, respectively. This principle has been successfully employed to control the activity of neurons in living cells and even tissue and gave rise to a whole new research field, optogenetics.|$|E

5000|$|Kaede is a <b>photoactivatable</b> {{fluorescent}} protein naturally {{originated from}} a stony coral, Trachyphyllia geoffroyi. Its name means [...] "maple" [...] in Japanese. With the irradiation of ultraviolet light (350-400 nm), Kaede undergoes irreversible photoconversion from green fluorescence to red fluorescence.|$|E
50|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} control of substrate labeling {{has been investigated}} using <b>photoactivatable</b> cyclooctynes. This allows equilibration of the alkyne prior to reaction {{in order to reduce}} artifacts as a result of concentration gradients. Masked cyclooctynes are unable to react with azides in the dark but become reactive alkynes upon irradiation with light.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Photoactivatable</b> {{biotinylation}} reagents {{are ideal}} when primary amines, sulfhydryls, carboxyls and carbohydrates {{are not available}} for labeling. These reagents rely on aryl azides, which become activated by ultraviolet light (UV; >350 nm), which then react at C-H and N-H bonds. Because these types of bonds occur independent {{of the type of}} amino acid, this type of biotinylation is termed [...] "non-specific".|$|E
50|$|In 2002, one of Lippincott-Schwartz {{postdoctoral}} fellows, George Patterson, furthered the GFP methods. Patterson developed <b>photoactivatable</b> GFP {{that allowed}} for following molecules throughout a cell selectively instead {{of relying on}} photobleaching. Using this newly developed technique, Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz were able to further research the movement of molecules within cells. For example, a single lysosome could now be imaged to reveal the movement of its proteins alone.|$|E

5000|$|... m6A-CLIP ({{crosslinking}} immunoprecipitation) and miCLIP (m6A individual-nucleotide-resolution crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) are UV-based sequencing techniques. These {{two methods}} activate crosslinking at 254 nm, fragments RNA molecules before immunoprecipitation with antibody, {{and do not}} depend on the incorporation of <b>photoactivatable</b> ribonucleosides - the antibody directly crosslinks with a base close (very predictable location) to the m6A site. These UV-based strategies uses antibodies that induces consistent and predictable mutational and truncation patterns in the cDNA strand during reverse-transcription that could be leveraged to more precisely locate the m6A site.|$|E
50|$|Light is a well-suited {{external}} {{trigger for}} {{these types of}} experiments since it is non-invasive and does not influence normal cellular processes (care {{has to be taken}} when using light in the ultra-violet part of the spectrum to avoid DNA damage. Furthermore, light offers high spatial and temporal control. Usually, the activation stimulus comes from a laser or a UV lamp and can be incorporated into the same microscope used for monitoring of the effect. All these advantages have {{led to the development of}} a wide variety of different <b>photoactivatable</b> probes.|$|E
50|$|Patterson’s <b>photoactivatable</b> GFP {{also led}} to an {{important}} development in research. Eric Betzig of Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Janelia Farm Research Campus in Ashburn, Virginia approached Lippincott-Schwartz in 2005 to pursue a partnership that could change cell biology as they knew it. Betzig realized that using Patterson’s development it was now possible to witness an individual molecule within a densely populated biological system such as a cell on the nanometric scale. He referred to this idea as “superresolution imaging” and believed that using this technique to pinpoint single molecules at a time could lead to determining the molecule’s exact location.|$|E

He was the first to demonstrate the use of genetic code engineering as a tool for the creation of therapeutic proteins and ribosomally synthetized peptide-drugs. He has succeeded with innovative engineering of biomaterials, in particular <b>photoactivatable</b> mussel-based underwater adhesives. Ned Budisa made seminal contributions {{to our understanding of the}} role of methionine oxidation in prion protein aggregation and has discovered the roles of proline side chain conformations (endo-exo isomerism) in translation, folding and stability of proteins.|$|E
50|$|<b>Photoactivatable</b> adenylyl cyclase (PAC) was {{discovered}} in Euglena gracilis and can be expressed in other organisms through genetic manipulation. Shining blue light on a cell containing PAC activates it and abruptly increases the rate of conversion of ATP to cAMP. This is a useful technique for researchers in neuroscience because {{it allows them to}} quickly increase the intracellular cAMP levels in particular neurons, and to study the effect of that increase in neural activity on the behavior of the organism. For example, PAC expression in certain neurons has been shown to alter the grooming behavior in fruit flies exposed to blue light. Channelrhodopsin-2 is also used in a similar fashion.|$|E
5000|$|PAR-CLIP [...] (<b>photoactivatable</b> ribonucleoside-enhanced {{crosslinking}} and immunoprecipitation) is a {{biochemical method}} for identifying the binding sites of cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes (miRNPs). The method {{relies on the}} incorporation of ribonucleoside analogs that are photoreactive, such as 4-thiouridine (4-SU) and 6-thioguanosine (6-SG), into nascent RNA transcripts by living cells. Irradiation of the cells by ultraviolet light of 365 nm wavelength induces efficient crosslinking of photoreactive nucleoside-labeled cellular RNAs to interacting RBPs. Immunoprecipitation of the RBP of interest is followed by isolation of the crosslinked and coimmunoprecipitated RNA. The isolated RNA is converted into a cDNA library and is deep sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology.|$|E
5000|$|In 2017, a new display {{known as}} the '3D Light PAD' was {{published}} [...] The display utilizes a medium compromised of a class of <b>photoactivatable</b> molecules (known as spirhodamines) and digital light processing (DLP) technology to generate structured light in three dimensions. The technique bypasses the need to use high powered lasers and the generation of plasma, which alleviates concerns for safety and dramatically improves the accessibility of the three dimensional displays. UV light and green light patterns are aimed at the dye solution, which initiates photoactivation and thus creates the 'on' voxel. The device is capable of displaying a minimum voxel size of 0.68 mm^3, with 200 μm resolution, and good stability over hundreds of on-off cycles.|$|E
50|$|The current RNA capture methods involve sorting {{cells in}} {{suspension}} from acutely dissociated tissue, {{and thus can}} lose information about cell morphology and microenvironment. Transcript abundance and isoforms are significantly different across tissues and are continually changing throughout an individual’s life. Gene expression is highly tissue specific, therefore with traditional RNA capture methods one must be cautious {{in the interpretation of}} gene expression patterns, as they often reflect expression of a heterogeneous mix of cell populations. Even in the same cell type, tissue measurements, where a population of cells is obtained, mask both low-level mRNA expression in single cells and variation in expression between cells. The <b>photoactivatable</b> TIVA tag is engineered to capture the mRNA of a single cell in complex tissues.|$|E

The isolated RNA is converted into a cDNA library and deep sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technology. Cross-linking the 4-SU and 6-SG analogs results in thymidine to cytidine, and guanosine to adenosine transitions respectively. As a result, PAR-CLIP can identify binding site locations with high accuracy.|$|E
50|$|PALM and STORM share {{a common}} {{fundamental}} principle, and numerous developments have tended to make the two techniques even more intertwined. Still, they differ in several technical details and a fundamental point.On the technical side, PALM is performed on a biological specimen using fluorophores expressed exogenously {{in the form of}} genetic fusion constructs to a <b>photoactivatable</b> fluorescent protein. STORM instead uses immunolabeling of endogenous molecules in the sample with antibodies tagged with organic fluorophores.In both cases the fluorophores are driven between an active-ON and an inactive-OFF state by light. In PALM, however, photoactivation and photobleaching confine the life of the fluorophore to a limited interval of time, and a continuous emission of the fluorophore is desirable in between without any fluorescence intermittency. In STORM stochastic photoblinking of the organic fluorophores (typically brighter than fluorescent proteins) was originally exploited to separate neighboring dyes. In this respect, the more robust the blinking, the higher the probability of distinguishing two neighbouring fluorophores.|$|E

40|$|SummaryPhotoactivatable {{fluorescent}} proteins {{bring new}} dimension {{to the analysis of}} protein dynamics in the cell. Protein tagged with a <b>photoactivatable</b> label can be visualized and tracked in a spatially and temporally defined manner. Here, we describe a basic rational design strategy to develop monomeric <b>photoactivatable</b> proteins using site-specific mutagenesis of common monomeric red-shifted fluorescent proteins. This strategy was applied to mRFP 1, which was converted into probes that are photoactivated by either green or violet light. The latter <b>photoactivatable</b> variants, named PA-mRFP 1 s, exhibited a 70 -fold increase of fluorescence intensity resulting from the photoconversion of a violet-light-absorbing precursor. Detailed characterization of PA-mRFP 1 s was performed with the purified proteins and the proteins expressed in mammalian cells where the <b>photoactivatable</b> properties were preserved. PA-mRFP 1 s were used as protein tags to study the intracellular dynamics of GTPase Rab 5...|$|E
40|$|Metalloproteases (ADAMs, MMPs) are multidomain {{proteins}} that play key roles in extracellular matrix remodelling and degradation, in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions {{and in the}} proteolytic liberation of membrane-anchored proforms of cytokines and growth factors, the so-called ectodomain shedding.

40|$|<b>Photoactivatable</b> {{derivatives}} of ceramide, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and sphingomyelin { 3 -(p-azido-m-[I- 125]iodophenyl) propionylceramide, 3 -(p-azido-m-[I- 125]iodophenyl) propionyl-GlcCer and 3 -(p-azido-m-[I- 125]iodophenyl) propionylsphingomyelin} were synthesized in {{an attempt}} to identify compartment-specific proteins involved in sphingolipid sorting or metabolism. In HT 29 and BHK cells the ceramide analogue entered the cell by monomeric diffusion, as evidenced by the prober's efficient internalization at low temperature (4 degrees C). In contrast, the <b>photoactivatable</b> GlcCer was internalized only at elevated temperatures (37 degrees C), presumably reflecting an endocytic mechanism of uptake. The <b>photoactivatable</b> ceramide was mainly metabolized to the corresponding sphingomyelin analogue, but small amounts of GlcCer and galactosylceramide were also synthesized. The newly synthesized photoreactive sphingomyelin was subsequently transported to the cell surface, a process that was effectively inhibited by the presence of brefeldin A. The incubation of cells with <b>photoactivatable</b> analogues at 4 degrees C, followed by illumination, led to the association of sphingolipid with a specific subset of proteins. The protein labelling pattern of ceramide differed from that of glucosylceramide. A further shift in labelling pattern was apparent when the cells were incubated with the lipid analogues at 37 degrees C. Moreover, most of the proteins labelled by photoreactive sphingomyelin seemed to be detergent-insoluble, which is indicative of a location in sphingolipid-rich micro-domains the plasma membrane. The potential of applying <b>photoactivatable</b> sphingolipids to further define and identify the role of distinct proteins in sphingolipid biosynthesis, transport and sorting, is discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of two-photon activation of <b>photoactivatable</b> fluorescent proteins {{is limited by}} a lack of information about two-photon activation rates. Here we present rates for the commonly used <b>photoactivatable</b> proteins PAmCherry, PAmKate and PA-GFP at different wavelengths using a novel method that allows us to determine the two-photon activation rates directly, independent of any reference data, with microscopic sample volumes. We show that PAmCherry features the highest rates of the tested proteins at 700 nm activation wavelength followed by PAmKate. Towards longer wavelengths, two-photon activation rates decrease for all three proteins. For PAmCherry, our data contradicts an activation model relying solely on two-photon activation and suggests additional activation pathways requiring at least two absorption steps. Our method is readily expandable to other <b>photoactivatable</b> fluorescent molecules. The presented results allow optimization of experimental conditions in spectroscopic and imaging techniques such as super-resolution fluorescence microscopy...|$|E
