25|$|Many of Lowe's constructions {{are created}} from willow saplings, {{often the only}} {{material}} used in installations. Lowe collects the saplings from Wisconsin farms in the summertime, gathering a large amount, <b>peeling</b> <b>off</b> the bark, and sanding the resulting sticks {{to bring out the}} white in the sapling. Flexibility and strength are essential with willow, allowing Lowe to bend and manipulate the wood to his needs.|$|E
25|$|Second dealing is {{generally}} done by dealing the cards from the hand. While holding the deck in the hand, the dealer will either push the top card {{to the side}} - revealing {{a small portion of}} the back of the second card (called 'the brief'), and strike the second card instead (this method is known as the strike second deal), or by pushing two top cards as one, in almost perfect alignment, and <b>peeling</b> <b>off</b> the second card while pushing the top card back flush with the deck (this method is called the pushoff second deal). Both methods have some advantages and disadvantages, depending on the situation.|$|E
25|$|Specializing in climbing, Rasmussen {{showed a}} {{propensity}} for attempting spectacular wins in mountain stages {{in which he}} {{broke away from the}} peloton early and rode alone for most of the stage. Michael Rasmussen was known for his care for detail when considering weight. With a low weight (60kg) he was usually one of the lightest riders in his class. He was known for <b>peeling</b> <b>off</b> unnecessary stickers from his bike, not wearing the Livestrong wristband which was common among many Tour de France riders, due to the additional grams. He used to count each grain of rice before eating and had water with his breakfast cereal, instead of milk. He only carried one water bottle holder and his Colnago Extreme-C bike weighed 6.81kg, only 10g more than the minimum limit.|$|E
30|$|Adhesion {{test was}} {{performed}} on the films as per ASTM-B 905 standard after bending. The scotch tape <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> test was conducted on the deposited thin film on the PI substrate via spray pyrolysis, using transparent adhesive tape. The tape was adhered to the ITO deposited PI film and was <b>peeled</b> <b>off</b> from it. The SEM micrographs of the samples were collected before and after the <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> test. No significant change in the surface morphology of the deposited film was observed after the <b>peel</b> <b>off</b> test which suggests that the bonding was fairly strong. These results can be explained {{on the basis of the}} van der Waal’s interaction between the metal oxide film and the PI substrate [41].|$|R

25|$|By 1999, the 75-year-old stadium {{was showing}} its age. Except for the turf and {{lighting}} enhancements, no substantial upgrade {{of the stadium}} had occurred since the press box was built 25 years earlier, in 1975. The OU College of Architecture was housed under the west stands and in the north end zone, until other facilities became available in 1990. The artificial turf on Owen Field had literally become threadbare before its replacement in 1981; {{it is possible that}} the poor condition of the Superturf, prior to its 1994 replacement, contributed to a crash of the Sooner Schooner during a 1993 game against Colorado. The east side of the stadium still had the original dirt flooring underneath the stands, making for a cloudy, dusty walk into the student and visitor seating sections. Restrooms were old and inadequate; paint was <b>peeling</b> <b>off</b> external walls and the areas under the stands (the east side in particular) were dark and smelled like dust.|$|E
25|$|Silversides {{became a}} part of the Combined Great Lakes Navy Association in Chicago, Illinois, behind Chicago's Naval Armory on 24 May 1973. For years, the {{submarine}} was tended by a small crew of dedicated volunteers, drawn to her illustrious history and technical marvels. They donated tens of thousands of man-hours to restore her, maintained her at their own expense, and served as docents and chaperones. When association volunteers first stepped on board, they faced a musty, mildewed sub with paint <b>peeling</b> <b>off</b> in sheets inside and out, and junk scattered everywhere. After many years, the refrigeration compartment had produced a growth so thick, they could be measured in multiple inches instead of millimeters. Evidence of water damage prevailed in the forward compartments but the aft end was in reasonably good condition. Topside, the decking was weathered and worn in spots and some areas of the superstructure were rusted and in need of replacement.|$|E
500|$|U2's 1987 song [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] from The Joshua Tree was {{inspired}} after lead vocalist Bono visited El Salvador during the Salvadoran Civil War and witnessed how {{the conflict between}} rebels and the U.S.-backed government affected local civilians.

The inner fleshy layers (upper surface) of these rays are near [...] "wood brown" [...] in color when dried, and have a layer of surface tissue that cracks into patches. There is a great deal of variation, however, to the extent in which the upper surface tissue of the rays crack: this tissue layer may also remain closely attached as a sheet over the unsegmented part of the outer wall with the part adhering to the rays variously cracked and sometimes finally <b>peeling</b> <b>off</b> in places.|$|E
500|$|The cyclone {{continued}} inland {{over the}} Suwannee River valley, causing widespread destruction {{in dozens of}} communities across interior northern Florida; in the hardest-hit settlements, intense winds left few trees or buildings standing. The hurricane razed [...] of dense pine forests in northern Florida, crippling the turpentine industry. Crops and livestock were destroyed, and thousands of individuals were left homeless. The storm killed at least 70 people in mainland Florida, while inflicting approximately $3 million in property damage across the state. Speeding north, the hurricane ravaged southeastern Georgia and the Sea Islands. In Savannah, a 45-minute onslaught of fierce winds unroofed thousands of structures. Parks, cemeteries, and streets in the city were littered with fallen trees, and the Savannah River saw dozens of wrecked boats. At least 37 people in Georgia lost their lives. Strong winds and high tides battered southeastern South Carolina, ruining rice crops and <b>peeling</b> <b>off</b> roofs. The storm then tracked through mostly rural sectors of North Carolina and did significant wind damage in the Raleigh–Durham area.|$|E
500|$|The {{silver birch}} is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree, typically reaching [...] tall (exceptionally up to [...] ), with a slender trunk usually under [...] diameter. The bark {{on the trunk}} and branches is golden-brown at first, but later this turns to white {{as a result of}} papery tissue developing on the surface and <b>peeling</b> <b>off</b> in flakes, in a similar manner to the closely related Paper birch (B. papyrifera). The bark remains smooth until the tree gets quite large, but in older trees, the bark thickens, becoming irregular, dark and rugged. Young branches have whitish resin warts and the twigs are slender, hairless and often [...] The buds are small and sticky, and development is sympodial, that is to say the terminal bud dies away and growth continues from a lateral bud. The species is monoecious with male and female catkins found in the same tree. Some shoots are long and bear the male catkins at the tip, while others are short and bear female catkins. The immature male catkins are present during the winter but the female catkins develop in the spring, soon after the leaves unfurl.|$|E

500|$|The fruit bodies {{start their}} {{development}} underground or buried in leaf debris, {{linked to a}} strand of mycelium at the base. As they mature, the exoperidium (the outer tissue layer of the peridium) splits open into 7 to 14 rays which curve backward; this pushes the fruit body above the substrate. Fully opened specimens can reach dimensions of [...] from ray tip to tip. The rays are of unequal size, with tips that often roll back inward. They comprise three distinct layers of tissue. The inner pseudoparenchymatous layer (so named for the resemblance to the tightly packed cells of plant parenchyma) is fleshy and thick when fresh, and initially pale beige but darkening to yellow or brown as it matures, often cracking and <b>peeling</b> <b>off</b> in the process. The exterior mycelial layer, often matted with fine leaf debris or dirt, usually cracks to reveal a middle fibrous layer, which is made of densely packed hyphae 1–2.5μm wide. The base of the fruit body is concave to vaulted in shape, and often covered with adhering dirt. The roughly spherical spore sac (endoperidium) measures [...] in diameter, and {{is supported by a}} cluster of short columns shaped like flattened spheres. It is gray-brown in color, and minutely roughened with small, lightly interconnected warts. There are several to many evenly dispersed mouths, the ostioles, mainly on the upper half of the endoperidium. They are roughly circular with fimbriate (fringed) edges. The inedible fruit bodies have no distinct taste, although dried specimens develop an odor resembling curry powder or bouillon cubes.|$|E

The Alaska Railroad weaves back and forth under the highway, which causes the highway to become a series of small bridges. For a few miles after the bridges, the Seward Highway is a four-lane road, but then merges back to two lane. After passing through about [...] of forest, the highway passes Primrose Spur Road, and enters Primrose. For the next five or so miles (8 km), the route runs alongside Kenai Lake. Just before <b>peeling</b> <b>off</b> of Kenai Lake, the route passes though Crown Point, passes the single runway Lawling Airport, and provides access to a large campground. The highway runs alongside the Trail Creek for about , before passing the settlement of Moose Pass. The road continues, passing along Upper Trail Lake for a few miles, before <b>peeling</b> <b>off</b> and returning to the dense forest, and passing a large mountain range. After a few more miles, the road passes the community of Tern Lake Junction, and intersects with Alaska Route 1 (AK-1), where Alaska Route 9 terminates, and the Seward Highway is designated to AK-1.|$|E

2500|$|The Feasts, Apostles and Prophets tiers {{are divided}} by two large icons in the middle. One {{of them is}} the Christ in Majesty {{situated}} directly above the Royal Door. At the start of the latest restoration this icon was in rather poor condition: the oil paint was <b>peeling</b> <b>off</b> and it was heavily infested by woodworm. The Christ in Majesty icon, as in that of the Pantocrator, is a traditional depiction of Jesus. Christ is seated on a throne as ruler of the world, wearing episcopal vestments. He makes the teaching gesture with his right hand, and he holds the Bible in his left, opened at the New Testament: [...] "Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world" [...] (Matthew 25:34). According to the Bible these are the words, Jesus will say for those who believe in him. This depiction is more popular in Western Christianity. Eastern Orthodoxy traditionally uses the so-called [...] "Deesis" [...] composition on iconostases. The Deesis illustrates the enthroned Christ entreated by Mary and John the Baptist. The Resurrection of Jesus was painted on the icon above the Christ in Majesty. It depicts the scene of the opening of the holy tomb, from which Jesus is ascending, with his five wounds on his hands, feet and chest. Four Roman soldiers, guarding the entrance of the tomb, witness the miracle of the resurrection.|$|E
2500|$|When the Lincolns {{moved into}} the White House in March 1861 (inaugurations did not move to January until the 1940s), they found it in a terrible state. [...] Furniture {{throughout}} the executive mansion was broken, wallpaper was <b>peeling</b> <b>off</b> in many rooms, and the décor was cheap, shoddy, and tasteless. President James Buchanan, Lincoln's predecessor, was a lifelong bachelor. His niece, Harriet Lane, acted as hostess and de facto First Lady. Lane focused primarily on her hosting duties, rather than maintaining the White House. [...] Although Congress allotted President Buchanan $20,000 ($ in [...] dollars) to refurbish the White House when he moved in, Buchanan spent nearly all these funds on building a glass conservatory adjacent to the mansion to replace an orangery {{on the east side}} of the White House built during the Jackson administration but torn down to make way for an expansion of the Treasury Building. Only two rooms were in acceptable condition: [...] The Blue Room and the East Room. The Blue Room had been wallpapered and carpeted in 1837 during the administration of Martin Van Buren, and the Rococo Revival gilded wood furniture (a purchase of Harriet Lane's, financed by the auction of older White House furniture) had only arrived in December 1859. The centerpiece of this suite was a large circular settee with a central table for flowers. The East Room, which was largely unfurnished because it was used as a ballroom, retained its 1818 Federal style furniture (which had been reupholstered in 1829), 1839 silver wallpaper with gold border, and 1853 draperies, lace curtains, and carpet.
