40|$|Experimental resin {{composites}} with incorporated polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) particles were developed, which theoretically {{could improve}} the surface {{properties of the}} materials, including the inhibition of bacterial adherence. To assess the surface properties in relation to biofilm formation and detachment, 23. 1 % (wt/wt) linear PTFE particles (FL- 30) and cross-linked PTFE particles (FC- 30) were incorporated into pure resin composites. Pure <b>PTFE</b> <b>plates</b> and pure resin composites without PTFE (F- 0) were used as control specimens. Sucrose-dependent Streptococcus mutans biofilms were formed on the specimen blocks inside an oral biofilm reactor for various time periods and analyzed with or without application of driving forces. In addition, water contact angles and surface roughness were measured. The water contact angles of FL- 30 (61. 2 °) and FC- 30 (65. 8 °) were larger than that of F- 0 (48. 5 °). The largest contact angle (107 °) was detected on pure <b>PTFE</b> <b>plates.</b> However, the surfaces of FL- 30, FC- 30, and pure <b>PTFE</b> <b>plates</b> were rougher than that of F- 0. Although the surface properties of the materials differed in terms of contact angles and roughness, these factors seemed not to affect biofilm formation on the surfaces within 5 h. Pure <b>PTFE</b> <b>plates</b> harbored almost the same amounts of biofilm as F- 0. However, when a very strong driving force was applied, {{it was clear that}} there were significantly smaller amounts of biofilms retained on pure <b>PTFE</b> <b>plates,</b> which showed contact angles much higher than those of the other materials. Hydrophobicity of the resin composite was improved by incorporation of PTFE fillers. However, surface resistance against biofilm formation was not improved...|$|R

Thereafter, the molds were fastened between two solid <b>PTFE</b> <b>plates</b> for 1 h. After solidification, the cylindrical molds were grated against a 240 -grit silicon carbide grinding disc that removed excess material and paralleled the two surfaces of the molds.

40|$|In this work, the {{influence}} of dry sliding between a steel counterpart ball and polytetrafluoroethylene (<b>PTFE)</b> <b>plate</b> sample on the transformation of PTFE molecular structure is investigated. With X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, the crystallinity of PTFE wear debris is revealed {{to be higher than}} that of the original PTFE sample due to shear-induced ordering during sliding. The different morphologies of the PTFE transfer film from the original PTFE, and the wear debris observed with SEM suggests that some properties have been changed in the transfer film. According to FT-IR analysis, part of the PTFE chains in the wear debris and transfer film has a conformational change into a planar-zigzag conformation. ...|$|R

Preliminary experimental investigations are described on the effect on such electromagnetically convoluted arcs of a vertically inclined, electrically insulated plate attached {{to the outside of}} the Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) cylinder containing the B-field producing coil. Experimental results are presented for the time variation of arc current and voltage along with post arc, photographic images of arc tracks on the PTFE cylinder and vertical plate, and video photographs of the plasma volume so formed.

40|$|Proposed in {{this study}} is a {{metallic}} isolator utilizing two orthogonal roller layers to realize the bidirectional isolation. One of the advantages of the proposed metallic isolator is the low friction coefficient to realize a long period. The other is the large tension resistance in the vertical direction. These features make it easy to be used in high-rise buildings. The metallic isolator consists of top and bottom plats, two layers of rolling shafts, a middle plat, L-shaped anti-tension connecting <b>plates,</b> and <b>PTFE</b> <b>plates.</b> When being compressed, the rolling shafts roll {{on the surface of the}} middle plate, providing very low friction force. While being tensioned, a sliding mechanism forms between the L-shaped anti-tension connecting plats and <b>PTFE</b> <b>plates,</b> and the isolation effect depends on the friction coefficient of the contact pairs. By virtue of the two roller layers set in orthogonal directions, the top plate is able to move in any horizontal direction relative to the bottom plate. The mechanical properties of the new base isolation device are investigated experimentally. The isolator was tested under the compression from 100 kN to 1000 kN. Several horizontal loading directions were selected as 0, 30 and 45 degrees to simulate the motion in any horizontal direction. The loading frequency changed from 0. 05 Hz to 0. 3 Hz with the amplitude varying from 20 mm to 150 mm. It is demonstrated that the metallic isolator is able to move smoothly in any direction with a relatively constant coefficient ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 04. The dependency on the vertical compression and the horizontal velocity is quite low and the mechanical property is stable and reliable...|$|R
40|$|Background: In vitro {{measurements}} of sunscreen products {{are used to}} assess their reliability in terms of photoprotection and photo-stability. Objective: In this study, several substrates have been fully characterized for in vitro sunscreen testing. Methods: The following different substrates have been utilised in the study: roughened PMMA plates, Transpore, Vitro-Skin, roughened quartz plate and a laboratory prepared roughened <b>PTFE</b> <b>plate.</b> The suitability of these substrates for SPF evaluation has been investigated by performing total absorbance {{measurements of}} seven sunscreen products with different SPF values produced by the same manufacturer. Results and conclusions: Application of sunscreen products on Transpore, roughened quartz <b>plate,</b> PMMA, <b>PTFE</b> and Vitro-Skin was performed efficiently. With regard to photo-stability of the substrate materials, only PMMA <b>plate,</b> <b>PTFE</b> and roughened quartz plate showed to be photo-stable after UV irradiation. With regard to SPF tests, our results indicate that Transpore, roughened quartz plate and Vitro-Skin are preferable to assess SPF values because of a better correlation between in vitro and in vivomeasurements. Our study also confirms that an initial calibration must be performed for sunscreen products labelled with different SPF values. Finally, {{the results of our}} measurements demonstrate that, although a correlation between in vitro and in vivo SPF results can be established, it is never exactly 1 : 1...|$|R
50|$|Rigid support can be {{provided}} either from bottom or top. In case of bottom supports generally a stanchion or Pipe Clamp Base is used. It can be simply kept on steel structure for only rest type supports. To simultaneously restrict in another direction separate plate or Lift up Lug can be used. A pipe anchor is a rigid support that restricts movement in all three orthogonal directions and all three rotational directions, i.e. restricting al the {{6 degrees of freedom}} This usually is a welded stanchion that is welded or bolted to steel or concrete. In case of anchor which is bolted to concrete, a special type of bolt is required called Anchor Bolt, which is used to hold the support with concrete. In this type of support, normal force and friction force can become significant. To alleviate the frictional effect Graphite Pad or <b>PTFE</b> <b>plates</b> are used when required.|$|R
40|$|Human {{activities}} in marine environment are expanding to more remote locations, exposing offshore structures and commercial vessels to more adverse environmental conditions. On the other hand, market has a continuous {{demand for more}} cost efficient designs. Therefore, {{the need for more}} sophisticated computational tools arises. In these tools, the inherent flexibility of the structure is involved in the calculation of its loading and response, introducing the aspect of fluid-structure interaction. The objective of the current study is to produce validation data for computational tools capable of modelling fluid-structure interaction (e. g. ComFLOW). To achieve that, an experiment is designed, conducted and its results are processed to assess their reliability. The designed arrangement includes a cylindrical flexible <b>plate</b> made of <b>PTFE,</b> placed horizontally inside a fully transparent container partly filled with water, while being attached to the bottom of a rigid cylindrical structure. The assembly is imposed to sinusoidal vertical oscillation using an electromagnetic linear drive. Due to the small scale of the arrangement and the small weight of <b>PTFE</b> <b>plate,</b> only optical instruments are used to measure structure's response. Specifically, the response of the flexible plate is measured using two instruments: a single-point laser Doppler vibrometer, that measures the velocity at a specific point of the plate and a stereoscopic set of cameras that can measure the displacements of the plate with high spatial resolution using 3 D digital image correlation method. The rigid body motion of the assembly is monitored by a laser distance measurer and the imposed force is measured using a load cell. The investigated parameters include characteristics of oscillation (amplitude and frequency), the thickness of <b>PTFE</b> <b>plate</b> and its submergence depth. The results are analysed and additional tests, required for identifying noise components, are described. Using the results of these tests, a low-pass filter was applied to the measurements of the vibrometer. Having these measurements filtered and numerically integrated, cross-checking between the displacements coming from the vibrometer and digital image correlation is carried out. The results reveal that the effect of noise coming from the linear drive can not eliminated at the full extend. Once the whole process is completed, conclusions are drawn and possible actions to improve the current set-up for a next series of experiments are recommended.

40|$|All-hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) {{cellulose}} composites {{were prepared}} by a mechanical blending technique followed by hot pressing and water-ethanol regeneration. The alkali treated fibres were ground and sieved to a size ranging from 45 µm to 500 µm. Introduction of fibres into 12 % w/v cellulose N-methyl-morpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) solution was performed with low solution viscosity at 100 °C. The solid mixtures were cut and heat pressed between heated glass and <b>PTFE</b> <b>plates</b> at 85 °C {{to obtain a}} flat smooth-surfaced composite sheet of approximately 0. 2 mm thickness. The cellulose was regenerated in a 50 : 50 water¿ethanol mixture that subsequently removed NMMO and stabilizer (Irganox 1010, Ciba) from the composite. FTIR and X-ray diffraction measurements were performed to investigate the structural change of cellulose from fibre into partially regenerated composite. Composition and thermal stability of composites were investigated using thermogravimetry. A broadening of the scattering of the main crystalline plane (0 0 2) and a depression of the maximum degradation temperature of fibre were observed. The observations revealed a structural change in the fibres. The mechanical properties of composites depended on size, surface area, crystallinity and the structural swelling of fibres...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} is outlined {{which can be}} used to determine the response of an experimental sample to a single, simple broadband frequency pulse in terahertz frequency time domain spectroscopy (TDS). The advantage that accrues from this approach is that oscillations and spurious signals (arising {{from a variety of sources}} in the TDS system or from ambient water vapor) can be suppressed. In consequence, small signals (arising from the interaction of the radiation with the sample) can be more readily observed in the presence of noise. Procedures for choosing key parameters and methods for eliminating further artifacts are described. In particular, the use of input functions which are based on the binomial distribution is described. These binomial functions are used to unscramble the sample response to a simple pulse: they have sufficient flexibility to allow for variations in the spectra of different terahertz sources, some of which have low frequency as well as high frequency cutoffs. The signal processing {{procedure is}} validated by simple reflection and transmission experiments using a gap between polytetrafluoroethylene (<b>PTFE)</b> <b>plates</b> to mimic a void within a larger material. It is shown that a resolution of 100  μm is easily achievable in reflection geometry after signal processing. ...|$|R

40|$|National audienceExtensive arsenic {{poisoning}} {{in drinking}} water {{has been reported in}} Asia,Argentina, Chile and Mexico. The contamination can derive from reductionprocesses occurring at soil near-surface and especially in riparianwetlands. The major characteristic of these areas is that flooding inducesalternating oxidizing and reducing conditions in accordance withthe water saturation. It has been shown that under reduced conditions,As and Fe solubilization is increased by the presence of colloidal organicmatter (OM) in soil solution. But what happens to As when thewater level decreases and subsequent soil oxidation is established ?Samples consisting of reoxidation products (Fe-OM rich) of a ripariansoil solution are collected on <b>PTFE</b> <b>plates</b> inserted into the upper horizonsof the soil during the dry season. Geochemical analyzes showed 75 % of OM, 9 % of Fe and 250 mg. g- 1 of As. First SEM and NanoSIMSresults indicate that As is not only associated with Fe-oxides as expectedin oxidized conditions, but also with OM and S-rich particles. Studiesdemonstrated that, in peat, As (III) is as sulphide minerals or directlybound to OM via sulfhydryl sites. However,in the oxidized precipitates,it is unlikely that As being as sulphide minerals and the sole OM-SHcomplexes cannot explain such concentration. Thereby, the presence ofAs-rich OM(S) is still unsolved. XAS (XANES and EXAFS) spectroscopy has been used to determinethe local environment of sulfur since it appeared to be a key factor inthe binding of As to OM. XAS was performed at the sulfur K-edge (Luciabeamline, Soleil synchrotron, Saclay) on our natural samples andseveral model compounds. Using XANES, sulfur could be seen in severaloxidation degrees (from -II to +VI). EXAFS spectra will then provideinformation on the As-S, S-O, and perhaps on S-C bonding andwill highlight the relation between As and OM. Thereby those resultswill show the ability of OM to directly or not bind As under oxidizingconditions and therefore whether wetlands are sinks or sources to As...|$|R

Comparison {{were made with}} an untreated sample and a <b>PTFE</b> smooth <b>plate.</b> These experimental results, supported by chemical and morphological surface characterizations, were discussed {{in the frame of}} the Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter regimes. For each wetting regime, surface fraction of solid, PTFE and carbon fibres and/or roughness coefficient were estimated by solving a system of Cassie-Baxter and/or Wenzel equations. The transition to one wetting regime to the other is also commented. Finally, the effects of ageing and of water temperature were studied. Ageing was found to alter the wetting behaviour of the GDL through its chemical degradation. An erosion and the crazing of the PTFE coating and an oxidation of the carbon fibres were pointed out. The decrease of the water surface tension linked to an increase of its temperature is also shown to lead to a better wetting and to an increase of the solid surface fraction value. This effect is reinforced by GDL ageing. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to find the optimal dimensions of rectangular plate-type micro-separators in order to enhance the continuous separation of immiscible liquids. The main structure of the separators contains two plates: a hydrophobic (<b>PTFE)</b> upper <b>plate</b> and a hydrophilic (stainless steel) bottom plate which formed the contact surfaces for the fluids in the channel. The devices have two outlets, one for the aqueous phase and the other for the organic phase enabling the continuous separation and withdrawal of the separated phases. Demulsification has been carried out using Shellsol/water emulsion in the presence of a non-ionic surfactant (Teen 80). The separation efficiency is investigated as a function of micro-separator sizes, channel depths, flow rates and plate configurations. The major parameter that controls the destabilization mechanism is the ratio between the droplet size and the channel depth. When the size of the dispersed droplets remains smaller than the height of the separator (channel depths: 25 - 100 mu m), creaming is the main demulsification mechanism. Creaming refers to the migration of the dispersed phase of an emulsion, under the influence of buoyancy. The particles float upwards and rise to the top due to the difference in the densities of the particles and the medium. The separation efficiency depends mainly on the residence time of the liquid/liquid mixture in the device regardless of the separator dimensions and channel heights. The separation rate is limited by the removal of the cream layer, formed at the top of the upper plate, from the separator. When the size of the dispersed droplets is larger than the depth of the separator (channel height of 9 pm), the separation performance and mechanism become different. The coalescence of the dispersed droplets occurs by passing through the device. The comparison of the data corresponding to creaming and coalescence phenomena emphasizes that the coalescence greatly enhance and accelerate the separation action. The phase separation in the micro-coalescer takes place considerably faster than in the micro-separators...|$|R
40|$|Adhesion {{of copper}} and solution-deposited {{polymers}} to fluoropolymers was studied using films of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and a TFE-perfluoroalkylvinylether co-polymer (PFA) with different manufacturing histories (cast, skived, laminated). These films {{were exposed to}} three surface modification techniques (lamination, sodium naphthalenide etching, acid-stripping). The depth of defluorination from the sodium etching was measured gravimetrically {{and the nature of}} the resultant chemical functionalities determined using internal reflectance (FTIR-IRS) and x-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopies. The surface functionality produced by the treatments was independent of fluoropolymer type. Surface area was the major variable affecting defluorination rate. For all but the skived PTFE films, there was little change in surface texture after one hour sodium etch or after subsequent acid stripping of the defluorinated layer. ^ Adhesive testing with three test geometries (90 degree peel test, torsional shear test, and stripping of transmission electron micrograph replicas) revealed that a combination of chemical and physical surface modification is required to produce good peel adhesion, with the relative importance of each dependent upon the specific adhesion test used. For relatively smooth films, the Na/Naphth appeared to function by increasing both the chemical functionality and the mechanical integrity of the surface layer. Polymer replicating films which were solution-deposited onto untreated PTFE and PFA gave interfacial failure and negligible adhesion. Smooth PTFE films which were superficially modified frequently failed by fibrillation of the fluoropolymer surface. For short etch times, adhesion improved and failure was interfacial. For long etch times, a mixed mode of failure occurred. Adequate adhesive strength could only be achieved by an increase in surface roughness. ^ The best adhesion was achieved by surface roughening followed by Na/Naphth treatment. For such <b>PTFE</b> surfaces <b>plated</b> with copper, peel and shear tests gave a mixed mode of failure, with copper and fluoropolymer found on both fracture surfaces. Extensive fibrillation occurred at the locus of failure. Provided chemical modification was adequate to allow wetting, the roughness of the surface (mechanical adhesion) dominated the properties of the adhesive bond. Prolonged Na/Naphth treatment (one hour) caused a reduction in peel strengths. ...|$|R
