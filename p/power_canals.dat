25|$|About 1826, White sent Witt to {{work for}} the Cohoes Company in Cohoes, New York. White and others founded the firm in 1826. In 1831, the Cohoes Company built a wooden dam across the Mohawk River above Cohoes Falls and later would {{construct}} six canals to provide hydropower to various mills, factories, and foundries in Cohoes. Witt went to work as paymaster for the Cohoes Company, although the date of his arrival is not known. Some sources claim that Witt helped to construct the dam and the six <b>power</b> <b>canals,</b> as well as platted the emerging village of Cohoes. If he did so, then it was under the supervision of Hugh White, the brother of Canvass (who had assumed construction supervisory duties, as Canvass White was too busy). Canvass White turned over operation of the Cohoes Company to Hugh White in 1830, before work on the dam began. Canvass White died in 1834, before work on the <b>power</b> <b>canals</b> began.|$|E

50|$|A Power Canal {{refers to}} a canal used for {{hydraulic}} power generation, rather than for transport of watercraft. The power canal was {{a major factor in}} the Industrial revolution in New England in the 19th century. Most early <b>power</b> <b>canals</b> were mill races used mechanically to transfer power directly from falling water to machinery in mill buildings. Later, the hydraulic power generated electricity locally for the same mill factories. These <b>power</b> <b>canals</b> were often filled in as electricity (transported by power lines) replaced the need for local water power, and road transport needs or city expansion needs reclaimed the land. Some hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>canals</b> were transformed into local electric generators, but most were closed. Remains of <b>power</b> <b>canals</b> can be seen in old mill towns and are often protected as historical structures today.|$|E

Located on the city's east side, it is one of several glacial drumlin that {{characterize}} the city's geography east of the Concord River and south of the Merrimack River. Prior to its residential development, Belvidere Hill was farmland. In 1849, the Proprietors of Locks and Canals purchased land at the top of what was then called Lynde's Hill, and built a reservoir in order to provide water pressure to the city's industries when the <b>power</b> <b>canals</b> were drained for maintenance. Fairmount Road, built to facilitate construction of the reservoir, also became a spur to the hill's residential development. The city's businessmen and political leaders found the hill a desirable place to live, in part because it provided views away from the heavily urbanized parts of the city.|$|E
50|$|Cotton {{from the}} Deep South's {{plantation}} and slave economy was the raw commodity {{on which the}} future of Cohoes was built. In the 1820s, the first cotton mill in Albany County was built in Cohoes. Egberts and Bailey was the first factory to use knitting machinery run by power, based on the Cohoes Company's <b>power</b> <b>canals.</b> The community became a center of textile manufacturing; in 1836 the Harmony Manufacturing Company was founded, later famous as Harmony Mills. Cohoes became a mill town, and to an extent a company town. During the 1870s the mills were enormously profitable because of the Erie Canal, which flowed past them at that time. Mill #3, at over 1000 ft long, has been considered the longest continuous textile mill {{in the country at}} the time. Cotton textiles were shipped to New York City, England and Europe, where demand was high.|$|E

5000|$|A power canal {{refers to}} a canal used for {{hydraulic}} power generation, rather than for transport. Nowadays <b>power</b> <b>canals</b> are built almost exclusively as parts of hydroelectric power stations. Parts of the United States, particularly in the Northeast, had enough fast-flowing rivers that water power was the primary means of powering factories (usually textile mills) until after the American Civil War. For example, Lowell, Massachusetts, considered to be [...] "The Cradle of the American Industrial Revolution," [...] has 6 mi of canals, built from around 1790 to 1850, that provided water power and a means of transportation for the city. The output {{of the system is}} estimated at 10,000 horsepower. Other cities with extensive power canal systems include Lawrence, Massachusetts, Holyoke, Massachusetts, Manchester, New Hampshire, and Augusta, Georgia. The most notable power canal was built in 1862 for the Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company.|$|E
50|$|In 1859, {{after the}} company had failed and had passed into receivership, Alfred Smith {{purchased}} at auction its hydraulic system, consisting of the dam, its gate houses, and 2.5 mi of <b>power</b> <b>canals</b> with a boat lock; some 1100 acre of land in Holyoke containing mills and other buildings; and the public water supply reservoir and gas plant, each with a distribution system. He formed the Holyoke Water Power Company and sold stock to investors. Over the next 30 years the company flourished, {{as a number of}} large mills were built in the area. Energy was transmitted from the waterwheels to mills via a distribution system of gears, shafts, pulleys, and belts. The canals first produced municipal electricity on October 14, 1884, from an electric generator connected to a water wheel-driven shafting in an industrial building. In 1888 this was replaced by a combination hydro and steam electric power plant on the First Level Canal.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from the}} Merrimack River, other water {{features}} include the Spicket River, which {{flows into the}} Merrimack from Methuen, and the Shawsheen River, which forms the southeastern border of the city. Lawrence has two <b>power</b> <b>canals</b> that were formerly used to provide hydropower to the mills - one on the north bank of the river, {{the other on the}} south. Channeling water into these canals is the Great Stone Dam, which lies across the entire Merrimack and was, {{at the time of its}} construction in the 1840s, the largest dam in the world. The highest point in Lawrence is the top of Tower Hill in the northwest corner of the city, rising approximately 240 ft above sea level. Other prominent hills include Prospect Hill, in the northeast corner of the city, and Mount Vernon, along the southern edge of the city. Most industrial activity was concentrated in the flatlands along the rivers. Den Rock Park, a wooded conservation district on the southern edge of Lawrence that spans the Lawrence-Andover town line, provides recreation for nature lovers and rock-climbers alike. There are also several small parks throughout town.|$|E

50|$|The Lewiston Water Power Company {{was founded}} about 1850 {{by a group}} of investors from Boston, Massachusetts, seeking to {{capitalize}} on the water power of the falls on the Androscoggin River between Lewiston and Auburn. The company built a series of <b>power</b> <b>canals,</b> and built cotton spinning and weaving mills along their banks. To facilitate the work of multiple mill complexes, they also constructed one of the world's largest bleacheries, and an industrial machine shop for producing parts and service for the mill equipment. The mills were successful and grew despite the start of the American Civil War in 1861, which greatly reduced cotton supplies, by stockpiling large amounts of raw cotton. The mills were able to bring supplies in and ship products out by rail, which had been brought to Lewiston in 1849. The Grand Trunk Station, located on the island formed by the canals, also brought in many French Canadian workers, who were employed by the mills, and {{came to be known as}} a local Ellis Island. The mill owners also built worker housing and community halls in proximity to the mills.|$|E
50|$|First {{settled by}} Europeans in the 17th century, East Chelmsford (later renamed Lowell {{in honor of}} the founders' {{deceased}} business partner) became an important manufacturing center along the Merrimack River in the early 1820s. It was seen as an attractive site {{for the construction of a}} planned industrial city, with the Middlesex Canal (completed in 1803) linking the Merrimack to the Charles River, which flows through Boston, and with the powerful 32' Pawtucket Falls. The already existent Pawtucket Canal, designed for transportation around the Pawtucket Falls on the Merrimack, became the feeder canal for a 5.6-mile long system of <b>power</b> <b>canals</b> based around the falls. Unlike many other mill towns, however, Lowell's manufacturing facilities were built based on a planned community design. Specifically Lowell was planned as reaction to the mill communities in Great Britain, which were perceived as cramped and inhumane. Initially the factories of Lowell were built with ample green space and accompanying clean dormitories, in a style that anticipated such later architectural trends as the City Beautiful movement in the 1890s. Lowell attracted both immigrants from abroad and migrants from within New England and Quebec (including a large proportion of young women) who lived in the dormitories and worked in the mills.|$|E
