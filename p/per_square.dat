5000|$|Similar to {{selectin}} binding, FimH binding {{also have}} a threshold where it only starts binding to the host cells above this threshold. This shear stress threshold is about 1 dynes <b>per</b> <b>squared</b> centimeter, slightly larger than that of selectin binding. Above this threshold, FimH also alternate between binding, pause and unbinding with the mannose residues. However, different from selectin binding, FimH binding to mannose-BSA can either have a very long or very short pauses. This cause FimH binding to exhibit a [...] "stick-and-roll" [...] adhesion, not rolling adhesion {{in the case of}} selectin binding. And unlike selectin binding which requires integrin to help with firm adhesion, FimH binding can become stationary, and this process is reversible. All of this is mediated by shear stress level: at shear stress higher than 20 dynes <b>per</b> <b>squared</b> centimeter, FimH binding is stationary. At shear stress higher than 100 dynes <b>per</b> <b>squared</b> centimeter, slow rolling is observed.|$|R
