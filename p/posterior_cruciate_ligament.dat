5|$|Born in Preston, {{he began}} playing {{football}} {{at a young}} age, taking inspiration from his father who played semi-professionally. Carlisle represented his home county of Lancashire at youth level. The start of his professional career was his Football League debut for Blackpool in September 1997. He moved to Queens Park Rangers in May 2000. In the same year, Carlisle won three caps for the England under-21 national team. He missed a number of matches for Queens Park Rangers due to a <b>posterior</b> <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligament</b> injury which at one stage led doctors to believe that his career was over. He then missed one month of the 2003–04 season because of an alcohol-related problem, and left Queens Park Rangers {{at the end of}} that season. In the summer of 2004, he joined Leeds United on a free transfer.|$|E
5|$|After Johnson scored {{just three}} goals {{in his first}} 24 {{appearances}} of the 2001–02 season, he fell out of favour with new manager Paul Hart, and from February to April 2002, {{in order to reduce}} the club's heavy wage bill, he was allowed to go on loan to fellow First Division clubs Sheffield Wednesday (for whom he scored twice in seven appearances) and Burnley (five goals in eight appearances). Burnley had agreed to pay £120,000 to sign Johnson on a permanent basis at the end of the season, but the transfer ultimately fell through. Upon his return to Nottingham Forest for the 2002–03 season, Johnson appeared to have found his form again that had made him such a success at Ipswich, scoring 29 goals in 47 appearances in all competitions as Nottingham Forest reached the play-offs. In February 2003, it was discovered that Johnson had been playing with a torn <b>posterior</b> <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligament,</b> and it was expected that his recovery would rule him out for up to six weeks; however, he was able to make a speedy return and was back in action against Grimsby two weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Dowie {{recommended}} Carlisle to Queens Park Rangers manager Gerry Francis, {{who paid}} a transfer fee of £250,000 to sign him on 25 May 2000. He played his first {{match for the}} team on 12 August 2000 in the 0–0 draw with Birmingham City at Loftus Road. He made a further 31 appearances in the 2000–01 season and scored three times, earning himself a call-up to the England national under-21 team. However, his season was cut short on 31 January 2001, when he suffered his first major injury after a tackle by Rufus Brevett during the 2–0 defeat to Fulham. It was found that Carlisle had torn his <b>posterior</b> <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligament,</b> an injury which kept him sidelined {{for a year and}} caused doctors to believe that his career might be over. While he was out of action, Queens Park Rangers suffered relegation to the Second Division after finishing 23rd in the league. Soon after the injury he attempted suicide, and years later was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Upon his return to football, Carlisle was injured again in a reserve-team match against Bristol City, sparking fears that he had aggravated his previous injury. The damage proved not to be particularly severe, although it delayed his return to training by a further month.|$|E

5|$|Two Barcelona players {{missed the}} final through suspension: right back Dani Alves, who {{picked up his}} third yellow card of the tournament in Barcelona's semi-final second leg against Chelsea on 6 May 2009; and left back Éric Abidal, who was sent off in the same game for a {{professional}} foul on Nicolas Anelka. Defender Rafael Márquez also missed the match after {{he picked up a}} knee injury in the first leg of the semi-final, ruling him out {{for the rest of the}} season. Forward Thierry Henry and semi-final-winning midfielder Andrés Iniesta were also doubts for the final; Henry damaged his right <b>posterior</b> <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligament</b> in Barcelona's 6–2 league win over Real Madrid on 2 May 2009, while Iniesta was discovered to have suffered a tear in his right thigh following Barça's 3–3 draw with Villarreal on 10 May. Both Henry and Iniesta returned to light training on 22 May, but they had not yet resumed training with the main squad and remained doubts for the final. Carles Puyol, however, was available for selection after he served a one-match suspension in the semi-final second leg. In all, FC Barcelona started with seven players who had come up through the youth system, of whom five were Catalans.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo provide {{anatomical}} and morphometric {{basis of}} the <b>posterior</b> <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligament's</b> tibial insertions in order to assist the creation of anatomical tibial tunnels, in the ligament surgical reconstruction. Material and methodsThe topographic anatomy and morphometry of the <b>posterior</b> <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligament's</b> anterolateral and posteromedial bundles’ tibial insertions were analyzed in 24 anatomical knee pieces. The pieces were photographed by a digital camera and the images obtained were studied by the software ImageJ, where the bundles’ insertion areas were measured in square millimeters, {{and the length of}} structures and the distances between significant points were measured in millimeters. ResultsIn 54. 2 % of the knees the insertion’ shape was concave; in most pieces (41. 6 %) the form of insertion was oval. The average <b>posterior</b> <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligament's</b> tibial insertion total area was 88. 33 ± 21. 66 mm 2; the average anterolateral bundle's tibial insertion area was 46. 79 ± 14. 10 mm 2 and it was 41. 54 ± 9. 75 mm 2 for the posteromedial bundle. ConclusionsThe anterolateral bundle has a tibial insertion area larger than the posteromedial bundle; the insertion areas of those bundles in our study, were smaller than the ones found in the literature.

After returning, Joe lost his X Division Championship in a triple threat match with Sonjay Dutt and Senshi. Senshi pinned Dutt to win the championship after Steiner laid out Joe with a steel chair. Joe would have his chance at revenge when he participated in a four-way number one contender match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship along with Sting, Christian Cage, and Scott Steiner at Victory Road on July 16.

25|$|In {{the season}} opener of the 2007 season, Bush and the Saints lost to the {{defending}} Super Bowl champion Indianapolis Colts 41–10. Bush was tied for a team-best 38 rushing yards on 12 carries. He also had seven yards on four receptions and a punt return for two yards in a disappointing opener for him and the Saints. Their next game was equally as disappointing, as the Saints were beaten 31–14 by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Bush averaged 2.7 yards per carry and 27 yards from scrimmage – {{over a third of}} which came on one play. Bush scored two rushing touchdowns, both one-yard runs, in the Saints' Week 3 loss to the Tennessee Titans. In that game, Bush carried seven times for 15 yards while catching six passes for 20 yards. Bush missed the final four games of the 2007 season with a partially torn <b>posterior</b> <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligament</b> in his left knee. Bush finished the season with six total touchdowns and 581 yards rushing, averaging 3.6 yards per carry.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the regular}} season began, Marshall {{suffered}} a slight tear to his <b>posterior</b> <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligament</b> (PCL) in the preseason game against the Detroit Lions. Although the injury sidelined him for a couple weeks, {{he was able to}} return and play in 15 games (1 start) during {{the regular season}}. Marshall had a total of 20 catches, 309 receiving yards, and 2 touchdowns for his rookie year. He caught a pass in each of the Broncos' final seven games of the season, totaling 18 receptions, 287 receiving yards, and 1 touchdown over that stretch. The lone touchdown came during an NBC Sunday Night Football home game against the Seattle Seahawks on December 3, 2006. In that game, Broncos quarterback Jay Cutler (who was making his NFL regular season debut as a rookie) threw a pass to Marshall {{on the right side of}} the field. Marshall broke and spun away from three tackles on his way to a career-high 71-yard touchdown. It was the second longest rookie-to-rookie pass play in Broncos history.|$|E
50|$|Between the {{articular}} facets in the intercondylar area, but {{nearer the}} posterior than the anterior {{aspect of the}} bone, is the intercondyloid eminence (spine of tibia), surmounted on either side by a prominent tubercle, on {{to the sides of}} which the articular facets are prolonged; in front of and behind the intercondyloid eminence are rough depressions for the attachment of the anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligaments</b> and the menisci.|$|R

3000|$|Many {{patients}} with FH have hypoplasia or aplasia of the anterior and or <b>posterior</b> <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligaments.</b> The tibia may be subluxed anteriorly {{relative to the}} femur. The ligament deficiency and subluxation are often not symptomatic at a young age, but these become a bigger problem when the child becomes taller and heavier. Patients with anterior subluxation may have associated a rounded posterior aspect of the proximal tibial epiphysis. Whether this is primary (congenital) or secondary (developmental) is unclear.|$|R
500|$|In the team's {{second meeting}} against the Bills on December 3, 2009, Sanchez {{suffered}} a sprained <b>posterior</b> <b>cruciate</b> <b>ligament</b> {{in the third}} quarter, prompting the veteran Clemens to take his place. Though there were no setbacks to the injury, head coach Ryan benched Sanchez the following game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for precautionary reasons, much to Sanchez's dismay. At 7–7, the Jets {{had a chance to}} secure a playoff berth if they won the remainder of their games. One such game was against the Indianapolis Colts who had 23 consecutive regular season wins. Sanchez and the Jets engineered a comeback win following Colts head coach Jim Caldwell's decision to controversially rest the team starters in the third quarter with a five-point lead. The following week, on January 3, 2010, Sanchez led the team into the playoffs, despite a subpar effort, completing 8-of-16 passes for 63 yards, en route to a 37–0 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, who rested their starters as the team had already clinched the AFC North division title and a playoff berth. The manner of the two wins, which gave the Jets their first playoff berth since 2006, caused many to claim the team had [...] "backed into the playoffs". Sanchez completed his rookie season with 2,444 yards, 12 touchdowns, and 20 interceptions.|$|E
500|$|Elias {{entered the}} 1996 NFL {{season as the}} likely third down back for the 1996 team. In 1995 no one had emerged to replace Dave Meggett in that role. [...] Elias again had strong preseason performances. [...] In one early August {{exhibition}} game he scored two touchdowns. [...] By August 22, he led the Giants in preseason carries. He entered the season as the first option third down back, ahead of Wheatley. In the September 30 contest against the Minnesota Vikings, John Randle picked fights {{with some of the}} Giants, including Elias. [...] Elias suffered turf toe in that game and it affected him in the next as well. [...] He also had an October ankle injury, which consisted of both a sprain and a bone chip. [...] That injury kept him out of the lineup, making Wheatley the third down back by default. [...] Elias did not get his third down role back until mid-November.
