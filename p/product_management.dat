Amy Barzdukas, senior director of <b>product</b> <b>management</b> for the Online Services and Windows Division at Microsoft, announced that Morro would not directly compete with other commercial AV software; rather it was focused on the 50 to 60 percent of PC users who did not have or would not pay for AV protection.

25|$|Taiwan's {{information}} technology industry has {{played an important role}} in the worldwide IT market over the last 20 years. In 1960, the electronics industry in Taiwan was virtually nonexistent. However, with the government's focus on development of expertise with high technology, along with marketing and management knowledge to establish its own industries, companies such as TSMC and UMC were established. The industry used its industrial resources and <b>product</b> <b>management</b> experience to cooperate closely with major international suppliers to become the research and development hub of the Asia-Pacific region. The structure of the industry in Taiwan includes a handful of companies at the top along with many small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) which account for 85% of industrial output. These SMEs usually produce products on an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or original design manufacturer (ODM) basis, resulting in less resources spent on research and development. Due to the emphasis of the OEM/ODM model, companies are usually unable to make in-depth assessments for investment, production, and marketing of new products, instead relying upon importation of key components and advanced technology from the United States and Japan. Twenty of the top information and communication technology (ICT) companies have International Procurement Offices set up in Taiwan. As a signer of the Information Technology Agreement, Taiwan phased out tariffs on IT products since 1 January 2002.|$|E

500|$|Sarah Hicks, Symantec's vice {{president}} of consumer <b>product</b> <b>management,</b> voiced concern over Windows Vista 64-bit's PatchGuard feature. PatchGuard was designed by Microsoft to ensure {{the integrity of the}} kernel, a part of an operating system which interacts with the hardware. Rootkits often hide in an operating system's kernel, complicating removal. Mike Dalton, European president of McAfee said, [...] "The decision to build a wall around the kernel with the assumption it can't be breached is ridiculous", claiming Microsoft was preventing security vendors from effectively protecting the kernel while promoting its own security product, Windows Live OneCare. Hicks said Symantec did not mind the competition from OneCare. Symantec later published a white paper detailing PatchGuard with instructions to obtain a PatchGuard exploit. After negotiations and investigations from antitrust regulators, Microsoft decided to allow security vendors access to the kernel by creating special API instructions.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to develop an {{environment}} or network that enables effective collaborative <b>product</b> structure <b>management</b> among stakeholders in each unit, throughout the entire product lifecycle and <b>product</b> data <b>management.</b> This thesis uses framework models as an approach to the problem. Framework model methods for development of collaborative <b>product</b> structure <b>management</b> are proposed in this study, there are three unique models depicted to support collaborative product structure management: organization model, process model and product model. In the organization model, the formation of <b>product</b> data <b>management</b> system (eDSTAT) key user network is specified. In the process model, development {{is based on the}} case companyâ€™s product development matrix. In the product model framework, <b>product</b> model <b>management,</b> <b>product</b> knowledge <b>management</b> and design knowledge management are defined as development tools and collaboration is based on web-based <b>product</b> structure <b>management.</b> Collaborative management is executed using all these approaches. A case study from an actual project at the case company is presented as an implementation; this is to verify the modelsâ€™ applicability. A computer assisted design tool and the web-based product structure manager, have been used as tools of this collaboration {{with the support of the}} key user. The current PDM system, eDSTAT, is used as a piloting case for key user role. The result of this development is that the role of key user as a collaboration channel is defined and established. The key user is able to provide one on one support for the elevator projects. Also the management activities are improved through the application of process workflow by following criteria for each project milestone. The development shows effectiveness of <b>product</b> structure <b>management</b> in <b>product</b> lifecycle, improved production process by eliminating barriers (e. g. improvement of two-way communication) during design phase and production phase. The key user role is applicable on a global scale in the company...|$|R
500|$|The {{authority}} and {{position of the}} design management function has a large influence on what the design manager does {{in his or her}} daily job. Kootstra (2006) distinguishes design management types by organisational function: design management as line function, design management as staff function, and design management as support function. Design management as a [...] "line function" [...] is directly responsible for design execution in the [...] "primary" [...] organisational process and can take place on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in the line are authority over and direct responsibility for the result. Design management as a staff function is not directly responsible for design execution in the [...] "primary" [...] organisational process, but consults as a specialist on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in this function are their limited {{authority and}} the need to consult line managers and staff. When the design process is defined as a [...] "secondary" [...] organisational process, design management is seen as [...] "supportive function".

40|$|Abstract: In {{the modern}} global economy, {{companies}} are facing ever-increasing challenges for short time-to-market {{to enter into}} the market early, for reduced time-to-volume to occupy the market quickly, and for decreased time-to-profit to get return from market shortly. <b>Product</b> lifecycle <b>management</b> (PLM) is {{recognized as one of the}} key leading technologies to facilitate companies to overcome these challenges, which will offer companies a new way to rapidly plan, organize, manage, measure, and deliver new products or services much faster, better, and cheaper in an integrated way. Following this trend, this study proposes a full scenario of technology solutions for PLM based on the complete analysis of business drivers, industry requirements, limit of current solution, and recent state-of-the-art review in the domain related to PLM. Potential industrial impact of the developed PLM technology solutions is analyzed. It is hoped that the proposed PLM technology solutions will form the frontier basis for further research, development, and application of PLM systems to quickly adapt to the dynamic changing market for industry companies to pursue the most advanced competitiveness.
