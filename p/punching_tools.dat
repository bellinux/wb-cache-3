The {{complexity of}} the process results from high nonlinear boundary conditions, {{as well as from}} contact profile and frictional effects. The SPIF analysis is mathematically complex.

40|$|The great {{diffusion}} of small motors makes interesting their efficiency increase, but it requires {{to consider the}} great commercial competition, the constraints of a large scale production {{and the needs of}} low cost, simplicity, reliability and safety. A very popular small machine is the universal motor (UM), largely adopted in a lot of domestic appliances. A typical and important example is the UM used in high speed vacuum cleaners, produced in several millions per year, with ratings over one kilowatt, at 30000 – 45000 rpm. Even if the manufacturers made great technological efforts to improve their performances, an energetic approach to their design criteria has not been adequately considered yet. The paper analyses some low cost efficiency improvement opportunities, considering the “UM - vacuum cleaner” system, under the following constraints: unvaried lamination geometry and stack length, so that the <b>punching</b> <b>tools</b> and the frame sizes can be preserved; torque-speed curve displacement, to be matched with the turbine curve; modification of field and armature winding data (total copper section unvaried); brushes axis displacement, to achieve an acceptable commutation behaviour.

40|$|Abstract. Extremely high {{strength}} of the ultra-high-strength steels leads to increased load factors on the sheet metal machinery and <b>punching</b> <b>tools.</b> This experimental study examines how much the convex punch geometry affects on cutting forces when punching ultra-high-strength steels. Tools used in the punching tests were four different convex sheared rooftop punches and one conventional flat end punch, which rooftop punches were compared to. The material in the punching tests was ultra-high-strength steel DQ 960, with a thickness of 4 mm. The material in punching tests was sheared with rooftop punches and a flat end punch and the cutting forces were measured. The quality of punched holes was evaluated visually and the roundness measurements were also performed. The {{results show that the}} cutting forces of DQ 960 can be reduced radically with optimal convex punch geometry. Using 14 ° shear angle at the punch end, the cutting forces reduced up to 57 % compared to the ones of the conventional flat end tool. However, the largest tested shear angles caused several negative effects on the cutting quality of the holes and hence they are not suitable in all applications. The punching tests proved that the cutting clearance had no appreciable effect on cutting forces when ultra-high-strength steel was punched. Instead there was a noticeable effect {{on the quality of the}} punched hole, especially when large shear angles were used...|$|E

40|$|Selecting {{the best}} {{set of tools}} to produce certain {{geometrical}} shapes/features in sheet metal punching {{is one of the}} problems that has a great effect on product development time, cost and achieved quality. The trend nowadays is, where at all possible, to limit design to the use of standard tools. Such an option makes the problem of selecting the appropriate set of tools even more complex, especially when considering that sheet metal features can have a wide range of complex shapes. Another dimension of complexity is limited tool rack capacity. Thus, an inappropriate tool selection strategy will lead to punching inefficiency and may require frequent stopping of the machine and replacing the required tools, which is a rather expensive and time consuming exercise. This work demonstrates that the problem of selecting the best set of tools is actually a process of searching an explosive decision tree. The difficulty in searching such types of decision trees is that intermediate decisions do not necessarily reflect the total cost implication of carrying out such a decision. A new approach to solve such a complex optimisation problem using the Monte Carlo Simulation Methods has been introduced in this thesis. The aim of the present work was to establish the use of Monte Carlo methods as an "assumptions or rule free" baseline or benchmark for the assessment of search strategies. A number of case studies are given, where the feasibility of Monte Carlo Simulation Methods as an efficient and viable method to optimise such a complex optimisation problem is demonstrated. The use of a Monte Carlo approach for selecting the best set of <b>punching</b> <b>tools,</b> showed an interesting point, that is, the effect of dominant "one-to-one" feature/tool matches on the efficiency of the search. This naturally led on to the need of a search methodology that will be more efficient than the application of the Monte Carlo method alone.
