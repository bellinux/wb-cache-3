The introduction of non ionic surfactant (tri-ton X- 100) circumvents bead formation and improves the homogeneity of fibre, as verified in the analysis of thermal, structural and morphological properties of PVA net.

Mechanical tests on PVOH/epoxy composites showed that, in general, their structural performance is between those of plasma-treated HP-PE and aramid fibre-reinforced composites. Structural mechanical properties of PVOH composites are better than those of HP-PE based composites due to the combination of a strong interfacial bond strength and a less pronounced anisotropic fibre character.

Long organic fibres mixed with polypropylene fibres by an apparatus called a "fibre separating and flying machine" were compression moulded into 3 mm thick composites. Dynamic viscoelastic properties of these composites were measured in the molten state using a rotational parallel plate rheometer. It {{was found that the}} dependence of angular frequency on storage modulus, G', for long organic fibre reinforced polypropylene is different from that of volume fraction of fibre, Vf and the relationships depend on the characteristics of the reinforcing organic fibres. The slope of the dynamic viscosity, eta' vs. angular frequency, omega curves increases gradually up to 45 degrees with increasing V-f. Influence of fibre content on dynamic viscoelastic properties depends on the organic fibre used. For low fibre content, G' increases with increasing V-f {{in the same way as}} eta', However, the opposite trend is observed for high fibre content composites. It can be deduced that there is an apparent yield from the relations between complex viscosity, eta* and complex modulus, G*.

Some new cotton products have been developed thanks to the inventions and efforts of scientists and engineers dealing with cotton. One of the innovative cotton products is SPINAIR yarn by Kurabo (Japan). It is so called “hollow” yarn made of cotton and PVA fibres. PVA fibres are introduced into the yarn during the spinning process. Next they are dissolved and removed in fabric finishing, thanks to which in the final product the yarn is composed only of cotton fibres. The yarn has been developed to improve the thermal insulation of cotton fabrics. Due to the dissolving of PVA fibres, the structure of yarn and fabrics made of it is loose and porous.

The highest water absorption percentage was 273 and 251 % for the composite with 2 and 10 wt% of poly(vinyl alcohol), respectively, in 24 hours. The high water absorbency could be due to the interaction of water with the hydroxyl group in the <b>poly(vinyl</b> alcohol) and <b>fibres,</b> similar to other reported works on cellulose composites. Interestingly, the poly(vinyl alcohol) in the composite only starts to dissolve very slowly over more than 7 days before the kenaf fibres started to dropout from the composite.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} stress-strain behaviour {{of individual}} fibre reinforced cement composites is reviewed. Based on the multiple cracking {{concept of the}} existing theory, analytical expressions are developed to describe the tensile stress-strain behaviour of a fibre-cement hybrid composite consisting of three components, i. e. two reinforcing fibres with different moduli, strengths and strains to failure and a common cement binder. The model predicts that the tensile stress-strain curve of the hybrid composites consists of five stages, instead of three stages of the existing models for individual fibre cements, and relates the tensile behaviour of each stage to the component properties of the components and the test system parameters. A description is given of the physical and mechanical properties of four types of reinforcing fibres used in the study. These were fibrillated polypropylene film, alkali-resistant glass, <b>polyvinyl</b> alcohol <b>fibres</b> and carbon fibres. A small number of direct tensile tests on continuous glass, carbon and polyvinyl alcohol were performed. The tensile stress-strain behaviour of four types of fibre-cement hybrid composites was studied with particular emphasis on that of the glass- polypropylene hybrids for which the flexural load-deflection behaviour was also examined. It is shown that the fibre-cement hybrid composites yield superior engineering properties over their parent composites and the improvements are sensitive to volume fractions {{of each of the}} two fibres. The measured tensile stress-strain curves of the hybrids were compared with the theoretical predictions and satisfactory agreement in general is obtained.

40|$|To obtain {{sustainable}} highly-durable structures {{with a long}} service life, {{one should}} tackle the problem of cracking in concrete. Not only is it aesthetically unwanted, cracking may also impair the service life of the construction. Therefore, the ingress of water and harmful substances should ideally be avoided and should be independent of manual repair to be reliable. Autogenous healing in strain-hardening cementitious materials in combination with superabsorbent polymers can be a solution. Here, the superabsorbent polymers will swell to several hundred times their own size when making contact with fluids, thus sealing the crack from intruding fluids. Afterwards, the water is provided to the cementitious matrix for autogenous healing. Further hydration and the precipitation of calcium carbonate crystals may hereby close the crack completely. One {{of the most important}} criterions is the crack width control, as only very narrow cracks may close due to autogenous healing. This is achieved by means of incorporated microfibres, leading to bridging action and multiple cracking. In this research, several types of fibres were tested. These include different types of commercially-available polyvinyl alcohol and polypropylene. It was found that some types of synthetic fibres may accelerate the autogenous healing capacity, due to their chemical nature. The type of fibre can hereby promote the nucleation of calcium carbonate crystals {{on the surface of the}} fibre, stitching the crack. This is especially the case with fibres consisting of polar hydroxyl groups. In combination with superabsorbent polymers, this feature was improved substantially as the water was gradually released towards the cementitious matrix, leading to a more abundant amount of crystals at the crack faces. The natural fibres are alternatives for synthetic fibres due to their good mechanical properties, but should be chemically treated to receive multiple cracking and to act as nucleation sites for calcium carbonate. In general, the most ideal material is a strain-hardening cementitious material with <b>polyvinyl</b> alcohol <b>fibres</b> and superabsorbent polymers. This material can close cracks efficiently and may thus lead to more durable constructions...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand {{for the use of}} Fibre Reinforced Polymers (FRP) in Reinforced Concrete (RC) design for various reasons, including electromagnetic neutrality and corrosion resistance. Glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforcing bars are one such alternative to steel reinforcement. Compared with steel, GFRP bars behave linearly elastic up to failure and do not yield, which can cause ductility concern. To compensate for this, the addition of <b>polyvinyl</b> alcohol (PVA) <b>fibres</b> to the concrete mix can improve the ductility response of RC members through improved post-cracking performance. This post-cracking performance is improved by two mechanisms: in the compression region fibres act to restrain concrete crushing, and delay failure, and in the tension region fibres transfer tensile stresses across cracks. This paper reports on an experimental study on the influence of fibre content on the deflection and energy absorption capacity of RC beams, and presents a structural mechanics based model for evaluating the deflection GFRP FRC members. The theoretical loaddeflection responses are compared to the experimental results, showing very good approximation of both the ultimate flexural capacity and the ductility of PVA fibre reinforced concrete members. The good correlation with experimental results confirms the applicability of this structural mechanics based approach in predicting deflections of RC members, and provides engineers with a useful tool to evaluate the ductility and energy absorption capacity of fibre reinforced concrete beams.

40|$|Portland cement {{concrete}} {{is the most}} used building material in the world. However, its manufacture is energy-intensive and it is susceptible to harsh environments. Alternative binder systems without ordinary Portland cement, such as geopolymers or alkali-activated materials, are recently new in the Civil Engineered world. These alternative binder systems seek, among other characteristics, improved durability and environmental efficiency. The attaining of strain hardening and multiple cracking typical of Strain Hardening Cementitious Composites (SHCC) using these alternative binder systems is very attractive from a conceptual point of view, since additional endurance to certain harsh or extreme environments, as well as enhanced durability, are usually expected as two of the main outcomes. In the present work, the behaviour of two different composites was studied: an existing Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC) and a new composite based on an alternative binder prepared with metakaolin. <b>Polyvinyl</b> alcohol (PVA) <b>fibres</b> were used in both materials. A series of experiments, including compressive and direct tensile testing were carried out to characterize and compare the mechanical properties of both materials.

This paper reports the development of geopolymer-based DFRCC where the cement binder in DFRCC is replaced by fly ash-based geopolymer binder and alkaline liquids (sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate) are used to activate the fly ash.

Such a major disaster developed a need for the stabilization of the liquefaction susceptible regions of the reclaimed Tokyo Bay coastline. This thesis specifically focuses on the stabilization against liquefaction of Toyoura sand with the typical silt contents found in the Tokyo Bay region using <b>polyvinyl</b> alcohol (PVA) <b>fibres</b> and Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC).

40|$|Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECCs) are {{a unique}} member of high {{performance}} fibre reinforced cementitious composites, featuring outstanding tensile strain-hardening capacity with superior tensile strain capacity and multiple microcracking with self-controlled tight crack width. Due {{to the importance}} of the tensile behaviour of the ECC, a hierarchical multiscale modelling method is developed for effective and efficient characterisation of the mechanical behaviour of ECCs under static and fatigue tensile loading. A generic analytical model is developed for crack bridging analysis in short fibre reinforced cementitious composites such as ECCs, which is the characteristic mechanical behaviour of ECCs at the microscale and lower mesoscale. The model predicts well the crack bridging stress-crack opening displacement relation. A representative volume element (RVE) model is proposed to model the joint response of the uncracked matrix and multiple cracks of ECCs at the upper mesoscale. The material randomness of ECCs is also considered in the RVE model. The RVE model is analysed by a hybrid cohesive zone model-extended finite element method (hybrid CZM-XFEM) method introduced in this work, which is used to simulate the multiple cracks adaptively as well as describe the crack cohesive behaviour using a simplified efficient cohesive model proposed based on the crack bridging analysis at the microscale and lower mesoscale. To characterise the mechanical behaviour of ECCs under fatigue tensile loading, degradation models of the micromechanical properties are proposed, and a cycle-dependent crack bridging relation, which accounts for both the interface degradation and fibre fatigue rupture, is developed based on the degradation models. The bridging stress degradation of ECCs under fatigue loading is modelled through a cyclic analysis based on the multiscale modelling method and the cycle-dependent crack bridging relation.

Changes in the fine structure of <b>polyvinyl</b> alcohol (PVA) <b>fibre</b> during stretching, heat-treatment and formalization, which are important procsses in manufacturing vinylon, were studied by measuring the rate of deuterium exchange between heavy water and the fibre and other characters. 　The results are as follows :　 1. The partition coefficient ofdeuteritun between D_ 2 O and PVA is 1. 10. 　 2. When PVA is spun into fibre form, PVA molecules seem to aggregate locally formimg many molecular bundles, and in each bundle they make a molecular net work. The formation of a second net work of the bundles may be considered also. 　 3. By stretching the fibre, some small crystallites are formed in amorphous part, and the meshes of the net work become smaller. 　 4. By heat-treatment, spaces between molecules or bundles become more narrow and crystals are formed also. In this case, the larger the space, the sooner the contraction. 　When treating temperatere is high, the growth of crystals is easy to occur laterally by accretion of other crystallites and section of other molecules, but is difficult longitudially along the molecules. 　The number of the crystal parts formed during heat-treatment seems {{to depend on the}} kind of fibre rather than the heat-treatment temperature. 　When the fibre is treated at low temperatures, the lateral order distrribution of the fibre is broad, but at high temperatures it becomes sharp, and the fine structure of the fibre approaches to the two-phase structure that is composed of crystal part and amorphous part. 　 5. These changes in the fine structure occur under the influence of molecular aggregation which may take place in a spinning process. 　That is, apart from molecular structure, the fine structure of vinylon fibre may be chiefly controlled by the aggregation of PVA molecules whrch takes place in an early stage of manufacture. 　 6. By heat-treatment at about 170 °., this aggregation state seems to change into a different one. Therefore, PVA fibre may have a transition point at about 170 ℃. 　 7. When the fibre is treated with an ordinary formalizing bath, not only are OH groups formalized but alsp the fine struccture of amorphous part is changed. However, the degree of crystallinity in the specimen does not decrease during the formalization. 　 8. The value of water accessibility for the heat-treated PVA fibre is nearly as large as that for rayon, and vinylon is intermediate in this value between rayon and cotton. 　 9. PVA fibre, and vinylon fibre also, has some low lateral order parts in its crystal part, and the permeation of water to the crystal part is possible to some extent. For this reason, the fibre shows a comparatively high accessibility to water in spite of its high crystallinity...|$|R
