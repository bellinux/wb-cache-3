5|$|From the mid-1870s Busch's {{illustrations}} {{were printed}} using zincography. With this technique {{there was no}} longer any danger that a wood engraver could change the character of his drawings. The originals were photographed and transferred onto a photosensitive zinc plate. This process allowed for the application of a clear, free pen-drawn ink line, and was a much faster <b>printing</b> <b>method.</b> Busch's use of zincography began with Mr. and Mrs. Knopp.|$|E

25|$|Only {{during the}} Ming and Qing dynasties did wooden and metal movable types see any {{considerable}} use, but the preferred method remained woodblock. Usage of movable type in China never exceeded 10 {{percent of all}} printed materials while 90 percent of printed books used the older woodblock technology. In one case an entire set of wooden type numbering 250,000 pieces was used for firewood. Woodblocks remained the dominant <b>printing</b> <b>method</b> in China until the introduction of lithography in the late 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The first Washington-Franklin stamp issued was a two-cent red Washington-head, {{issued on}} November 16, 1908, {{to pay the}} first class postage on a {{standard}} letter. The seven separate and distinct Washington-Franklin series appeared at intervals of {{a year or two}} and included denominations that ranged from 1-cent to 1 or 5 dollars, depending on the series. The different issues can be distinguished from one another by one or more of several factors: perforation gauge, the type of stamp paper—or, in some unusual varieties, by the <b>printing</b> <b>method</b> used. Four or five basic paper-types were employed during the life of the issue. Two of these have different watermarks (consisting of single-line and double line letters: 'USPS'), while another paper-type had no watermarks (watermarks are detected by placing the stamp in a special fluid). In 1909 a much less common type of bluish paper was used, made of 35% rag stock combined with the usual wood pulp and can readily be identified by its faint bluish-gray color. (N. B., Some contend that bluish paper contained only 10% rag stock.) Later in the same year the Post Office is supposed to have experimented with China clay paper, but whether such a paper stock actually existed has become a matter of dispute.|$|E

2500|$|The unusual {{sharpness}} of the inscription letters has long led epigraphists {{to believe that}} they were not carved by hand into the clay. The typographic character of the inscription was recently demonstrated in a systematic examination of the text body by the typesetter and linguist Herbert Brekle. His findings confirm that the text was produced with a <b>printing</b> <b>method</b> {{similar to that of the}} Phaistos Disc: The 17-line text was created by pressing individual, pre-formed stamps (probably made of wood) into the soft clay in a way that, for each letter which occurred more than once, the same letter stamp was re-used, thereby producing identical imprints throughout the text. Thus, the essential criterion for typographic text production was met, namely the repeated use of identical types for a single character. In applying this technique, it is not relevant that the Prüfening inscription was made by stamping letters into the clay and not − as later practiced by Gutenberg − by printing on paper, since neither the technical execution nor the print medium define movable type printing, but rather the criterion of type identity: ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was only}} after his contact with Swiss {{photographer}} Pierre Rossier (1829 [...] ca. 1890) that Ueno decided {{to pursue a career}} as a photographer. Rossier had been commissioned by the firm Negretti and Zambra to photograph in Asia and he worked in Japan from 1859 to 1860. He was only in Nagasaki for a short time, but while there he taught wet-collodion process photography to Ueno, Horie Kuwajirō (18311866), Maeda Genzō (18311906) and others. Soon after, Ueno's friend Horie bought a wet-plate camera. The purchase, which included photographic chemicals, was funded by the daimyō of Tsu Domain, Tōdō Takayuki, and the price was 150 ryō. Apparently the photographic equipment was of such interest to Ueno that he chose to become a subject of the Tsu Domain in order to have access to it at the domainal residence in Edo. and in 1861 Horie photographed Ueno at work in the domain's laboratory in Edo (now Tokyo). In 1862 Ueno and Horie co-wrote a textbook titled Shamitsu kyoku hikkei that comprised translated extracts from ten Dutch science manuals and which included an appendix titled Satsueijutsu [...] that described techniques of collodion process photography as well as Nicéphore Niépce's asphalt <b>printing</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E

40|$|Package labels play a {{critical}} role in communicating product benefits to consumers. On a package, labels are used to provide useful information about the product as well branding for the company. Labels need to not only be eye catching to the consumer, but must also communicate information concerning what is being sold. This is possible through various printing technologies available in today’s market. With technology steadily advancing, companies need to determine an optimal <b>print</b> <b>method</b> for packaging that satisfies budgetary, environmental, demand and consumer requirements. Through the collection of quantitative data, consumer attention and purchase preference were evaluated. Two different <b>printing</b> <b>methods</b> (digital and flexographic) were tested on fruit drink labels. A total of 248 participants completed this study, which took place at Pack Expo 2014 in Chicago, Illinois. Three eye tracking metrics were evaluated using eye tracking technology to investigate if the different <b>printing</b> <b>methods</b> had an effect on the consumer when shopping. Statistical analysis yielded no significant difference for participant’s attention when shopping for fruit drinks with digital or flexographic labels. It was also concluded that the position on the shelf made no significant difference for either label type. This study illustrates that consumers cannot significantly determine a difference between the two <b>printing</b> <b>methods</b> tested...|$|R
