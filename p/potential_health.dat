5|$|Although hot {{chocolate}} is generally consumed for pleasure, the beverage confers several <b>potential</b> <b>health</b> benefits. A 2003 study from Cornell University found that cocoa contains {{large amounts of}} antioxidants that may help prevent cancer. Also, it has been demonstrated that the cocoa bean helps with digestion. From the 16th to 19th centuries, {{hot chocolate}} was valued as a medicine {{as well as a}} drink.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>potential</b> <b>health</b> {{problem is}} {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically {{inherited}} disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, the United States Food and Drug Administration {{issued a}} warning to the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group {{regarding}} HAACP (hazard analysis and critical control points) violations that were found at a processing plant in Irving, Texas. FDA found that lemon and lime juice was held in unsanitary conditions, which was a <b>potential</b> <b>health</b> threat to consumers. Company managers were advised by FDA that a reduction in microorganism levels was necessary to protect consumers.|$|E
40|$|Strategies for {{sampling}} {{shallow soils}} at {{hazardous waste sites}} are employed primarily to evaluate levels and distributions of contamination. The ensuing analyses of <b>potential</b> public <b>health</b> impacts are therefore dependent on the sampling design rather than having the sampling design based on the data needs for evaluating <b>potential</b> public <b>health</b> impacts of shallow soil contamination. We define a specific objective that guides the sampling of shallow soils.

5|$|In a 2009 {{study of}} 16 Portuguese edible wild {{mushroom}} species, R.botrytis {{was shown to}} have the highest concentration of phenolic acids (356.7mg per kg of fresh fruit body), made up largely of protocatechuic acid; it also had the highest antioxidant capacity.

5|$|Polyphenols {{of several}} classes are {{widespread}} in medicinal plants; these substances likely fight infection and reduce grazing by herbivorous insects. They include hormone-mimicking phytoestrogens, and astringent tannins. In Ayurveda, the astringent rind of the pomegranate {{is used as}} a medicine, while polyphenol extracts from plant materials such as grape seeds are sold for their <b>potential</b> <b>health</b> benefits despite the lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{consumption}} of parsnips has <b>potential</b> <b>health</b> benefits. They contain antioxidants such as falcarinol, falcarindiol, panaxydiol, and methyl-falcarindiol, which may potentially have anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. The dietary fiber in parsnips is partly of the soluble and partly the insoluble type and comprises cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The high fiber content of parsnips {{may help prevent}} constipation and reduce blood cholesterol levels.|$|E
