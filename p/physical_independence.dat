One of the problems encountered is how to separate applications from the data so that the same data can be used by many applications and changes to data organization have - besides execution-time - no effect on applications.

Some of the most gifted women writers of the period came out of these early salons (such as Madeleine de Scudéry and Madame de Lafayette), which encouraged women's independence and pushed against the gender barriers that defined their lives.

50|$|A device {{virtualization}} feature, delivered using split multi-link trunking protocols {{that are}} proprietary to Avaya products, Switch Cluster is interoperable with third party Ethernet switches, servers, appliances, and IP routers that support standardized link aggregation protocols (i.e., 802.1AX/802.3ad). Switch Cluster logically virtualizes {{a pair of}} like switches so that they effectively appear and operate as a single network entity. This provides <b>physical</b> <b>independence</b> and increases network availability. Typically deployed in the core or distribution/aggregation tiers of the network, Switch Cluster mitigates against a single point-of-failure outage, and supports traffic flows at both Layer 2 and Layer 3. First released in 2001, Switch Cluster {{was the first of}} competing “Multi-Chassis LAG” capabilities proposed by other networking vendors. Avaya intends Switch Cluster to provide high-availability multi-homed connectivity, deployable individually or as an active-active access solution for Fabric Connect.|$|E

5000|$|The {{affluent}} Fugger and Thurzo families {{founded the}} prosperous Ungarischer Handel company (German for [...] "Hungarian Trade") in 1494. Depending {{mainly on the}} mines around Banská Bystrica, the company had become a leading world producer of copper by the 16th century. With the most sophisticated mining technologies in Europe, an advanced accounting system, and benefits including medical care for its 1,000 employees, Ungarischer Handel {{was one of the}} largest and most modern early-capitalist firms. An early record of the miners' industrial action is from 1526 when the City Council needed to take refuge within the confines of City Castle. The Ottoman Empire's thrust northwards led the magistrate to improve the city's fortifications with modern stone walls in 1589, but the Turks never occupied the region. Banská Bystrica became one of the foremost centers of the Protestant Reformation in the Kingdom of Hungary in the 16th century. Later on, the city had to fight for its religious freedom guaranteed by the Royal Charter against the ruling dynasty of the Austrian Roman Catholic Habsburgs, for its <b>physical</b> <b>independence</b> against the Ottoman Turks and for its self-governance against the Kingdom of Hungary's powerful magnates.

40|$|Objective: Chronic lung {{problems}} often constrain <b>physical</b> <b>independence</b> {{of older}} occupants. The usefulness and practicality {{of an existing}} <b>physical</b> <b>independence</b> level assessment has been studied. Methods: Nine independently living older occupants (aged 52 - 73) with chronic lung disease participated in a pilot study. Physical performance in daily activities was determined from heart-rate and body-movement registrations during a seven-day period at home and a standardised cycle ergometer test in hospital. The individual’s baseline for <b>physical</b> <b>independence</b> was deduced from physical performance outdoors. Results: The highest actual energy expenditure at a relative physical strain of 40 % allowed us to assign subjects to <b>physical</b> <b>independence</b> levels 3 (4 subjects) or 4 (5 subjects). At level 3 activity accommodations, technical aids, and informal assistance are required; at level 4 professional assistance is needed too. Subjects at level 4 had lower values of body weight, body height, peak oxygen uptake, and peak minute ventilation than subjects at level 3. The severity of airflow limitations did not predict <b>physical</b> <b>independence</b> level. Physical performance during outdoor walking showed a higher relative physical strain (above 40 %) at <b>physical</b> <b>independence</b> level 4 as compared to 3. This high strain limits duration of performance {{as a way of}} activity accommodation. Conclusion: <b>Physical</b> <b>independence</b> level assessment is suited to distinguish baselines for <b>physical</b> <b>independence</b> levels 3 and 4 under daily living conditions in older occupants with chronic lung disease. In the future, the assessment method may give insight into the influence of efficacious interventions on physical performance parameters...|$|E

BMI and WC were assessed and categorized according to established criteria. Physical fitness was evaluated with the Senior Fitness Test and individual test results were expressed as Z-scores. Projected ability for <b>physical</b> <b>independence</b> was assessed with the 12 -item composite physical function scale. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for being physically dependent. A total of 30. 1 % of participants were classified as at risk for losing <b>physical</b> <b>independence</b> at age 90 years. Combined fitness and fatness analysis demonstrated that unfit older adults had increased odds ratio for being physically dependent in all BMI categories (normal: OR = 9. 5, 95 %CI = 6. 5 – 13. 8; overweight: OR = 6. 0, 95 %CI = 4. 3 – 8. 3; obese: OR = 6. 7, 95 %CI = 4. 6 – 10. 0) and all WC categories (normal: OR = 10. 4, 95 %CI = 6. 5 – 16. 8; middle: OR = 6. 2, 95 %CI = 4. 1 – 9. 3; upper: OR = 7. 0, 95 %CI = 4. 8 – 10. 0) compared to fit participants that were of normal weight and fit participants with normal WC, respectively. No increased odds ratio was observed for fit participants that had increased BMI or WC. In conclusion, projected <b>physical</b> <b>independence</b> may be enhanced by a normal weight, a normal WC, or an increased physical fitness. Adiposity measures were not associated with <b>physical</b> <b>independence,</b> whereas fitness is independently related to <b>physical</b> <b>independence.</b> Independent of their weight and WC status, unfit older adults are at increased risk for losing <b>physical</b> <b>independence...</b>|$|E

This study aims to analyze quantitatively the impact of baseline values and changes in physical activity, physical fitness, body composition, and co-morbidities on the <b>physical</b> <b>independence</b> of community-dwelling, older adults over a 5 -year period.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} predictors, available at admission, of <b>physical</b> <b>independence</b> at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Secondary aims were to identify predictors of functional gain and length of stay (LOS). We included 1310 adult stroke patients who were admitted for inpatient rehabilitation in five Dutch rehabilitation centres. Data on the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Clinical Rehabilitation at admission and discharge (physical and cognitive independence, mood, pain and fatigue), age, sex and in a subsample stroke characteristics as well were collected. A prediction model was created using random coefficient analysis. None of the stroke characteristics were independently associated with <b>physical</b> <b>independence</b> or functional gain at discharge, or LOS. Higher physical and cognitive independence scores and severe pain at admission were predictors of higher <b>physical</b> <b>independence</b> scores at discharge. Furthermore, lower <b>physical</b> <b>independence</b> scores, higher cognitive independence scores, less pain at admission and younger age predicted more functional gain. Finally, lower physical and cognitive independence scores at admission and younger age predicted longer LOS. <b>Physical</b> <b>independence</b> at admission was the most robust predictor for rehabilitation outcome in a Dutch rehabilitation setting. To a lesser extent, age, cognitive independence and pain predicted rehabilitation outcome after stroke. Treatment of cognition and pain should be taken into account during rehabilitation. Further work needs to be carried out to establish whether focusing on these factors improves outcome after rehabilitation. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
