50|$|In {{the season}} opener against the Ravens, Palmer was held to 99 yards and no touchdowns, {{completing}} only 10 out of 25 passes with an interception. For {{the first time in}} his career, Palmer wore a clear <b>protective</b> <b>visor</b> because of a broken nose. In the following 24-7 loss to the Tennessee Titans, Palmer was 16 of 27 for 134 yards and two interceptions. As the Bengals fell to 0-3 against the New York Giants in a 26-23 overtime loss, Palmer went 27 for 39 for 286 yards and a touchdown.|$|E
5000|$|During the 2007-08 pre-season, White {{suffered}} a serious eye injury. During a team practice on September 19, [...] "White was defending against two-on-one rushes when John Madden gave rookie Nicklas Bergfors the puck {{for a shot}} that deflected off White's stick and {{hit him in the}} nose and near the right eye." [...] White was able to return to the lineup on November 21 to play in the Devils' 2-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins. Despite still suffering from some blurred vision in his right eye, he was able to play over 17 minutes, blocked 2 shots, and was credited with six of the Devils' fifteen hits. White quickly returned to his regular spot in the Devils line-up, where he began wearing a <b>protective</b> <b>visor</b> on his helmet.|$|E
50|$|Ruggedized HMDs are {{increasingly}} being integrated into the cockpits of modern helicopters and fighter aircraft. These are usually fully integrated with the pilot's flying helmet and may include <b>protective</b> <b>visors,</b> night vision devices, and displays of other symbology.|$|R
40|$|Transparent armor is a {{material}} or system of materials {{designed to be}} optically transparent, yet protect from fragmentation or ballistic impacts. This class of materials is used in such diverse applications as <b>protective</b> <b>visors</b> for non-combat usage, including riot control or explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) actions.

50|$|Jordan Smith was {{promising}} defenceman who was {{a prospect}} for the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. On February 24, 2006 in a game vs the Manchester Monarchs he {{was hit in the}} face by a deflected puck shot by Jeff Tambellini while playing for the Portland Pirates in an American Hockey League game. Smith lost vision in his left eye and was forced to retire from professional hockey. Shortly afterwards, the American Hockey League announced that <b>protective</b> <b>visors</b> would be mandatory beginning in the 2006-07 season.|$|R
50|$|Both Cochrane and Trubshaw {{insisted on}} many changes {{as they began}} testing on Concorde. One of the first {{problems}} they encountered was the <b>protective</b> <b>visor</b> on the front window, which, with two narrow slits, left them with {{a good view of}} the clouds but limited visibility for landing. They also encountered problems as they flew the Concorde prototype to its maximum speed of Mach 2.2. When they decided to turn off the re-heat system, the Olympus jet engines went into a cyclic surge condition known as a 'forward firing backfire'. The French had experienced the same problems and the British insisted that the engine controls be changed from an analogue to a digital system. This was one of the main reasons that led to soaring costs and the seven-year delay. On one occasion in 1974, Cochrane was flying Concorde 002 when one of its undercarriage legs would not lock in the down position whilst preparing for landing. He safely made an emergency landing and it led to another vital modification on the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|A {{more recent}} {{addition}} to the football helmet is the visor or eye shield, which is affixed to the face mask to protect players from glare or eye injuries, such as pokes. It is believed that {{the first player to}} use a <b>protective</b> <b>visor</b> Mark Mullaney of the NFL's Minnesota Vikings in 1984, in order to protect a healing eye injury. Top manufacturers of visors are Nike, Oakley, and Under Armour, with Leader being the first to come out with a visor/shield for former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon. While Mullaney and McMahon's visors were tinted, most of the earlier visors were clear or smoked, but they are now offered in a variety of styles ranging from blue, gold, black, rainbow, silver, or amber. High-school and pee-wee leagues prohibit all but clear visors. This rule was enacted so that training staff and coaches can easily view a player's face and eyes {{in the case of a}} serious injury, to discern if the player is conscious. The NCAA banned the use of tinted visors for the same reason, and the NFL has followed suit as well. However, players with eye problems may still obtain special permission to wear tinted visors, some notable examples being LaDainian Tomlinson and Chris Canty.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Transparent ceramics are used {{in a variety of}} applications such as <b>protective</b> <b>visors,</b> thermo-graphic lens, night vision devices and windowpane of an armed vehicle, missile domes and in aircrafts. Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (YAG, Y 3 Al 5 O 12) exhibits uniform index of refraction without birefringence owing to its cubic crystal structure and offers a range of optical and mechanical properties that makes it suitable for transparent applications.

40|$|Thirty-three {{cases of}} retinal {{detachment}} following hockey injury were seen during a 15 -year period at the retina clinic of Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal. Most injuries occurred in adolescents, {{the average age}} being 18 years. The mean interval between injury and preoperative examination was 3 years. Almost half of these young hockey players remained legally blind in the affected eye even after a successful operation. A helmet with a <b>protective</b> face <b>visor</b> is suggested as the best prevention against severe ocular damage such as retinal detachment...|$|R
40|$|During high floods {{the erosion}} along the {{shoreline}} will increase, {{which can lead to}} floating debris ending up in the river and the spillways will be clogged. There are a variety of preventive measures that can be taken {{to reduce the risk of}} floating debris. It can be anything from removing trees in sensitive areas, to set up booms that control the debris. To find out how much potential debris there are, an inventory has been made for the Granfors and Krångfors reservoirs. Since no similar work has been made, different methods had to be worked out for the different parts of the project. • Method of Inventory • Method of Calculating the amount of debris • Method for Risk Analysis To better understand how to apply the appropriate preventive measures, a short-term study of how debris behaves at high flows, and how different types of booms and <b>protective</b> <b>visors</b> work have been made. The results of the inventory and risk analysis showed that there is a possibility for a relatively large amount of debris for both facilities implying to a probability that the facilities will not be able to cope with the amount of debris without any preventive action is taken. The recommendation for both reservoirs is a cleanup of the debris and deployment of diversion booms. The booms should be placed either in front of the hydroelectric plants and divert the debris onto land, or deflect the debris by the spillway in Granfors, and then be taken care of, either in Krångfors or deflected by Krångfors, and taken care of in Selsforsen.

40|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{technological and}} medical developments achieved in recent years, {{a significant amount}} of occupational health problems still exist in modern dentistry. The risk of eye injury is mostly attributed to the use of high-speed hand pieces and ultrasonic devices. A dental clinic may be the source of eye-related infection and injury because of mechanical, chemical, microbiological and electromagnetic irritants. Accidents may cause facial injuries that involve eyes of the clinicians, patients as well as dental assistants. Eye injuries can vary from mild irritation to blindness. The use of eye protection tools, such as <b>protective</b> goggles and <b>visors,</b> reduces the risk of eye damage or complete loss of vision while working with dangerous and floating materials. Therefore, all precautions should be taken, even when performing common procedures for which the risk expectancy is relatively low. Clinicians should be aware that they are also responsible for providing adequate protection for their assistants and patients, as well as themselves...|$|R
