However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues. A culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more <b>people</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, {{it can be difficult}} to separate the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory so calculating the proportions of fat, protein and carbohydrate is difficult.

Diseases such as diphtheria, measles, meningitis, tetanus, pertussis, yellow fever, polio, and cholera, all of which are uncommon in developed countries, may be prevented with vaccination. Some of these diseases, such as cholera and measles, spread rapidly in large populations living in close proximity, such as in a refugee camp, and <b>people</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> immunised by the hundreds or thousands in a short period of time. For example, in Beira, Mozambique in 2004, an experimental cholera vaccine was received twice by approximately 50,000 residents in about one month.|$|E
25|$|Another part of {{restructuring}} the movement comes from education; bell hooks {{points out that}} there is an anti-intellectual stigma among the masses. Poor people do not want to hear from intellectuals because they are different and have different ideas. As bell hooks points out though, this stigma against intellectuals leads to poor people who have risen up to become graduates of post secondary education, to be shunned because they are no longer {{like the rest of the}} masses. In order for us to achieve equality, <b>people</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> able to learn from those who have been able to smash these stereotypes. This separation leads to further inequality and in order for the feminist movement to succeed, they must be able to bridge the education gap and relate to those in the lower end of the economic sphere. If they are able to do this, then there will be more success and less inequality.|$|E

He stated that, [...] "the <b>people</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> persuaded that the Chetniks are their only friends {{and that it is}} from them that they can expect freedom and a happy life" [...] and instructed the Chetniks to [...] "work day and night and maintain the spirit of the people". He wrote, [...] "the hour of freedom is near. Allied aid for the Chetniks is assured, and the whole world is admiring them." [...] In August, he launched a counterattack against Ustaše troops returning to Foča as the Italians withdrew their garrisons from the hinterland. The Chetniks feared the Ustaše were about to unleash another round of genocidal violence on the Serb population in the area. At least 2,000 local Muslims were subsequently killed in Foča by forces under Ostojić's command.|$|E
500|$|Some anarchists, such as Johann Most, {{advocated}} publicising {{violent acts}} of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because [...] "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda." [...] Scholars such as Beverly Gage contend {{that this was}} not advocacy of mass murder, but targeted killings of members of the ruling class at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population, such as during periods of heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed. However, Most himself once boasted that [...] "the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the <b>people</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> set in motion." [...] Most is best known for a pamphlet published in 1885: The Science of Revolutionary Warfare, a how-to manual on the subject of making explosives, based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in New Jersey.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} German Ideology, Marx {{turned to}} a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding [...] "the theory and tactics" [...] of a truly [...] "revolutionary proletarian movement" [...] operating {{from the standpoint of}} a truly [...] "scientific materialist" [...] philosophy. This work was intended to draw a distinction between the utopian socialists and Marx's own scientific socialist philosophy. Whereas the utopians believed that <b>people</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> persuaded {{one person at a time}} to join the socialist movement, the way a person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief, Marx knew that people would tend on most occasions to act in accordance with their own economic interests, thus appealing to an entire class (the working class in this case) with a broad appeal to the class's best material interest would be the best way to mobilise the broad mass of that class to make a revolution and change society. This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning, but to get the manuscript past the government censors he called the book The Poverty of Philosophy (1847) and offered it as a response to the [...] "petty bourgeois philosophy" [...] of the French anarchist socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as expressed in his book The Philosophy of Poverty (1840).|$|E
