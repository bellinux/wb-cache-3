40|$|The {{extent of}} government-controlled forest land was surveyed: 9 224 ha of {{declared}} forest reserve and 5 369 ha of unallocated state lands were found. These figures were cause for concern, because they fell far short - by some 10 000 ha - of the targets {{established by the}} 1985 National Structure Plan. The project also identified non- production, or protection, forest, including a proposed parrot protection zone. The area of potential production forest amounted to only 4 680 ha. Furthermore, of the 5 369 ha of unallocated lands, 3 410 ha had forest production potential; this forest resource could {{provide an opportunity for}} plantation forestry developmentThe resource base capable of sustained yields was thus found to be much less than previously estimated, both as a result of more precise land tenure information, and {{due to the fact that}} high-quality forest was located outside the forest reserve, on land subsequently allocated for agricultural development. The result is that, although there was a future for the forest industry, it was not at the level previously estimatedIt was therefore recommended that further allocation of the unallocated state lands identified by the project be suspended, pending the Government's decision on future land use. The Land Use Working Committee should be responsible for providing the Government with advice on policy formulation and decision-making. Furthermore, in view of the importance of the protection and conservation role of the forest, protection forest - including the area currently proposed as a parrot protection zone - should be incorporated into a protection and conservation primary use zone that formally excludes loggingIn view of the limited area of potential production forest remaining within the existing forest reserves, and the significant area of such land in the remaining unallocated state lands, which could provide the base for establishing a plantation resource to replace the resource removed by agricultural development, the Government should consider further agricultural development only on land with identified high agricultural potential. Further, it was recommended that the Government seek external assistance to develop a plantation resource on the remaining unallocated state lands, incorporating this area into the <b>permanent</b> <b>state</b> <b>forest.</b> A proposal to this effect should be given high priority in the forthcoming Tropical Forestry Action Plan exerciseThe project also recommended that the Government implement an educational programme, reinforced by Forestry Division patrols, to ensure that encroachment does not occur on any of the remaining unallocated land prior to the Government's decision regarding its use. In order to help implement these suggestions, it was recommended that the Forest Management and the Forest Silviculture Sections be combined into a new Forest Operations SectionFinally, it was recommended that, given the promising results of theproject's orchid production, the Government seek external assistance to fund further orchid consultancies, with the aim of transferring the necessary technology to the private secto...|$|E
