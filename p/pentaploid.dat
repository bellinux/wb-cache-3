(buffalograss) {{is a major}} {{component}} of mixed- and shortgrass prairies of the Great Plains, and is of economic importance both as a forage grass and as a native turfgrass alternative for lawns and golf courses. Like many dominant Great Plains grass species, B. dactyloides comprises an autopolyploid series including diploids, tetraploids, <b>pentaploids,</b> and hexaploids. Preliminary studies indicate that diploids are relatively rare, unlike more broadly distributed higher cytotypes. However, the distribution of these cytotypes is poorly understood. As cytotypes often vary with regards to phenotypically important traits, establishing the distribution of buffalograss cytotypes and evaluating ecological differentiation among them may provide important biological, conservation, and economic insights. This study first aims to establish the geographic distribution of B. dactyloides cytotypes using the locations of both chromosome counted specimens and a set of freshly collected or museum-obtained specimens in which cytotype has been estimated with a genetic approach. Secondly, we assess whether individual cytotypes exhibit differing abiotic tolerances by evaluating both distribution models and statistical analyses of 19 environmental variables. Fifteen microsatellite loci successfully amplified in range of 578 field and herbarium specimens, of which 13 loci were used for cytotype estimation. Microsatellite variation accurately estimated cytotype in 89 % of samples from which a chromosome count had been obtained. Diploids and <b>pentaploids</b> were rare, and the common tetraploid and hexaploid cytotypes occupied non-random portions of the buffalograss range.

The genus Gossypium is composed of about forty wild diploïd species that constitute an important reservoir of interesting genes for the genetic improvement of Gossypium hirsutum L., the main cultivated cotton species. Creation of monosomic alien addition lines (MAAL), made up of plants having {{in addition to the}} chromosome set of the cultivated species one wild species' supernumerary chromosome, is an interesting way to exploit this diversity. Numerous constraints limit the creation of MAAL, among them the most important is doubtless the production of first generation derivatives from <b>pentaploids</b> obtained by backcrossing G. hirsutum with bispecific hexaploid hybrids made of the cultivated species tetraploid genome and the genome of a donor diploid species. Raising this impediment by appropriate techniques allows to develop MAAL offering the possibility to introgress finely traits of interest from diploid species and to better understand genomic relationships between species in the genus Gossypium. Identification and exploitation of these MAAL have been for a long time based on not very reliable morphological characteristics and on the use of classical cytogenetic techniques, very heavy to implement. Nowadays, the exploitation of MAAL benefits from the great advances registered in molecular biology through the development of DNA markers and molecular cytogenetics.

Presented at the 13 th Annual Capitol Graduate Research Summit, Topeka, KS, February 2, 2016. Buchloë dactyloides (Nutt.) Engelm. (buffalograss) {{is a major}} component of mixed- and shortgrass prairies of Kansas and the Great Plains, and is of economic importance both as a forage grass and as a native turf grass alternative for lawns and golf courses. Like many critical Great Plains grasses, buffalograss includes a series of cytotypes (genotypes differing in the number of sets of chromosomes per cell), including diploids (2 sets), tetraploids (4 sets), <b>pentaploids</b> (5 sets), and hexaploids (6 sets). This is important, as cytotypes often vary with regards to economically important ecological traits, and since the diploid cytotype is sought after for plant breeding and crop improvement. Preliminary studies suggest that buffalograss diploids are rare, and the overall picture of cytotype distribution within buffalograss is essentially unknown. This is important since rapid range shifts due to climate change could potentially eliminate certain cytotypes if they are non-randomly distributed geographically. The aim {{of this study is to}} use genetic tools to establish the geographic distribution of buffalograss cytotypes, and we have observed the number of alleles (versions of a gene) at 14 genetic loci in 437 individuals. Using this approach we infer that diploids are indeed rare, with only three individuals identified. Tetraploids and hexaploids are both quite common, and each of these polyploids is clearly non-randomly distributed geographically. Clarifying the distribution of buffalograss cytotypes will therefore identify important seed stock locations for turf grass and conservation breeding programs...|$|R

The taxonomy and phylogeny of the local landraces has not been fully studied. The main cultivated species is Dioscorea minutiflora Engl. Others found with low distribution are Dioscorea alata L., Dioscorea bulbifera L. and Dioscorea odoratissima Pax. Flow cytometry was used to estimate the ploidy level of 155 accessions of Kenyan yam including two checks, TDr. 18544 a tetraploid and TDc. 98136 an octoploid from International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Nigeria. Also included in the study were Dioscorea dumetorum Pax, Dioscorea asteriscus Burkill and Dioscorea schimperiana Kunth which are yam wild relatives. Leaf samples were harvested from the field genebank and nuclei extracted using an extraction buffer (Partec GmbH, Munster Germany). Plant nuclei were isolated and stained with propidium iodide then analyzed in a flow cytometer. Seven ploidy levels of 3 x (11. 4 %), 4 x(37. 5 %), 5 x(29. 2 %), 6 x(14. 6), 7 x(3. 1 %); 8 x(3. 1 %) and 10 x(0. 6 %) were observed. Tetraploids (4 x) formed the highest proportion followed by <b>pentaploids</b> (5 x). The highest ploidy, decaploid, (10 x), was found in D. odoratissima Pax, a conspecific form of Dioscorea preahensilis found under cultivation in two farms in Western Kenya. No diploids were observed in the study. Ploidy level was not associated with geographical habitat of the landraces while farmer-named varieties were not associated with ploidy levels. The findings generated new knowledge and form a basis for future yam research and improvement in the country. Further work is required to establish the phylogeny of Kenyan yam landracesPeer Revie...|$|R
