5|$|By 2005, Marvel Entertainment began {{planning}} to independently produce its own films and distribute them through Paramount Pictures. Previously, Marvel had co-produced several superhero films with Columbia Pictures, New Line Cinema and others, including a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox. Marvel made relatively little profit from its licensing deals with other studios {{and wanted to}} get more money out of its films while maintaining artistic control of the projects and distribution. Avi Arad, head of Marvel's film division, was pleased with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films at Sony, but was less <b>pleased</b> <b>about</b> others. As a result, they decided to form Marvel Studios, Hollywood's first major independent movie studio since DreamWorks.|$|E
5|$|In the Politburo Podgorny {{could count}} on the support of Gennady Voronov and Petro Shelest. Podgorny was {{constantly}} in conflict with Kosygin over policy issues in the Politburo. When Podgorny and Kosygin actually agreed on something Brezhnev would find himself in the minority, and forced to follow their decisions. However, Podgorny was <b>pleased</b> <b>about</b> his position within the leadership, and even more pleased by the extension of powers given to the Supreme Soviet. As head of state, Podgorny saw little threat to his position, even if a Central Committee resolution from 1971 had called {{for the expansion of}} Party activities in the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Taraki {{attended}} {{a conference of}} the Non-Aligned Movement in Havana, Cuba. On his way back he stopped in Moscow on 20 March and met with Brezhnev, foreign minister Andrei Gromyko and other Soviet officials. It was rumoured that Karmal {{was present at the}} meeting in an attempt to reconcile Taraki's Khalq faction and the Parcham against Amin and his followers. At the meeting, Taraki was successful in negotiating some Soviet support, including the redeployment of two Soviet armed divisions at the Soviet-Afghan border, the sending of 500 military and civilian advisers and specialists, and the immediate delivery of Soviet armed equipment sold at 25 percent below the original price. However, the Soviets were not <b>pleased</b> <b>about</b> the developments in Afghanistan and Brezhnev impressed upon Taraki the need for party unity. Despite reaching this agreement with Taraki, the Soviets continued to be reluctant to intervene further in Afghanistan and repeatedly refused Soviet military intervention within Afghan borders during Taraki's rule as well as later during Amin's short rule.|$|E

25|$|Georgescu {{lived long}} enough to survive the {{communist}} dictatorship in Romania he had fled earlier in his life (see above). He even received some late recognition from his fatherland: In the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent Romanian Revolution in 1989, Georgescu was elected to the Romanian Academy in Bucharest. He was <b>pleased</b> <b>about</b> this election.|$|E
25|$|Rising living standards, {{together}} with Dr. Mahathir's showpiece buildings and outspoken defence of Malaysia's interests, {{contributed to a}} sense of national identity, pride and confidence that had not existed before. He put Malaysia on the map, and most Malaysians were <b>pleased</b> <b>about</b> it.... , {{he would not be able}} to escape responsibility for many of the problems likely to plague Malaysian society in the future, from creeping Islamisation to corruption and inequality. For while he held Malaysia together for 22 years, the political-administrative system atrophied and decayed under his personalised brand of governance.|$|E
25|$|When he {{approached}} Pearson and the English university system, Georgescu was amazed with the informality and openness he found. There {{was no more}} feeling like a métèque, a stranger. Studying with Pearson {{for the next two}} years and reading Pearson's work on the philosophy of science, titled The Grammar of Science, further shaped Georgescu's scientific methodology and philosophy. The two men even made a friendship, and Pearson encouraged Georgescu to carry on with his studies in mathematical statistics. They co-pioneered research on the so-called 'problem of moments', one of the most difficult topics in statistics at the time, but neither of them were able to solve the problem. This was a great disappointment to Pearson, but Georgescu was <b>pleased</b> <b>about</b> experiencing their joint effort nonetheless.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{antagonist}} of {{the game}} is the Alfard Empire, led by Emperor Geldoblame. He seeks to revive the Ancient God of Destruction, Malpercio, who was sealed away one thousand years ago by the ancient Children of the Earth. He is unsealed as the Alfard Empire pursues Geldoblame's ambitions, and is not <b>pleased</b> <b>about</b> being sealed away. He is described as experiencing hatred and jealousy for all humanity. Giacomo is a high-ranking officer in the Imperial Army of Alfard. He is muscular, powerful, serious, prudent, and forceful. Ayme and Folon are high-ranking officers in Alfard's army, under Giacomo's direct command. Giacomo and Ayme were involved in the murder of Kalas' grandfather Georg and brother Fee. Manipulating the Alfard Empire is Melodia, the granddaughter of Duke Calbren of Mira and another major villain, though she is not revealed as such until she orders Geldoblame's death. She could be considered to be the voice of Malpercio.|$|E
25|$|Haig {{thought that}} IV Corps had bungled {{and that a}} {{counter-attack}} big enough to ensure success would need another 40 British heavy artillery batteries. The offensive on the Somme was imminent and although Haig thought that the guns could {{be returned to the}} Somme in time, this would depend on the German reaction. Should the Germans continue operations on the ridge, the existing British positions would be at risk and there might be a delay in returning the guns. Although the Germans had gained observation over the British lines, they had not become untenable and Haig decided that the diversionary Attack on the Gommecourt Salient north of the Somme, was more important. On 17 May, Haig ordered the First Army to cancel its attack; IV Corps was to plan instead for a much bigger effort. The plans produced by IV Corps were the basis of the scheme for the Canadian Corps attack at the Battle of Vimy Ridge (9–12 April 1917). Rupprecht was <b>pleased</b> <b>about</b> the large bag of prisoners (229) who were questioned by German interrogators, who gleaned much information on the orders of battle of the 47th (1/2nd London) and the 25th divisions, the way that British artillery-observation officers worked, details about machine-guns and field fortification.|$|E
25|$|According to his autobiography, Oh My, Dick Enberg (then {{the lead}} play-by-play voice for The NFL on NBC) was {{informed}} by NBC {{that he would}} become the lead play-by-play voice of the Major League Baseball Game of the Week beginning with the 1982 World Series (sharing the play-by-play duties for that game with Joe Garagiola, alongside analyst Tony Kubek) and through subsequent regular seasons. Enberg wrote that on his football trips, he would read every edition of The Sporting News {{to make sure he}} was current with all the baseball news and notes. He then met with NBC executives in September 1982, who informed him that Vin Scully was in negotiations to be their lead baseball play-by-play announcer (teaming with Garagiola, while Kubek would team with Bob Costas) and would begin with the network in the spring of 1983. Therefore, rather than throw him in randomly for one World Series, Enberg wrote that he hosted the pre-game/post-game shows while the team of Joe Garagiola and Tony Kubek did the games. According to the book, Enberg was not <b>pleased</b> <b>about</b> the decision (since he loved being the California Angels' radio voice in the 1970s and was eager to return to baseball) but the fact that NBC was bringing in Scully, arguably baseball's best announcer, was understandable. Enberg added that NBC also gave him a significant pay increase as a pseudo-apology for not coming through on the promise to make him the lead baseball play-by-play announcer.|$|E

25|$|Śrīrāghavapriyādarśanam (Sanskrit: श्रीराघवप्रियादर्शनम्). Viśvāmitra, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa {{arrive in}} Mithilā. Rāma {{is pleased to}} be in the city of Mithilā, but the other kings who have come in Sītā's Svayaṃvara are not <b>pleased</b> <b>about</b> his arrival. The people of Mithilā {{experience}} bliss in seeing Rāma. When Janaka asks Viśvāmitra about the two princes, Viśvāmitra introduces Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to Janaka. Janaka takes both princes to his palace and welcomes them. Later Lakṣmaṇa wishes to see the city of Mithilā and Rāma accompanies him. The children of Mithilā take Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa around the city, and embrace Rāma in the end. Early morning on the next day, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa go to the royal garden of Janaka to get flowers for Viśvāmitra's worship. Sītā arrives in the same garden to worship Pārvatī on the day before her Svayaṃvara. Sītā and Rāma see each other for the first time when they come face-to-face in the garden. Rāma tells Lakṣmaṇa about the attraction he feels for Sītā. He tells Lakṣmaṇa that Sītā must be his wife in future, for even in his dreams his mind never longs for the wife of another. Lakṣmaṇa then bows to Sītā, thinking of her as his mother. Sītā worships Rāma in her mind and then departs for her palace after worshipping Pārvatī. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa return to Viśvāmitra and worship him with the flowers from Janaka's royal garden. Rāma tells Viśvāmitra everything about the attraction he felt for Sītā. Viśvāmitra blesses Rāma and goes to sleep. Rāma is awake in the night, admiring the beauty of the moon which reminds him of the face of Sītā.|$|E
500|$|Hewitt {{joined the}} newly formed No.101 (Fleet Cooperation) Flight, {{operating}} SeagullIII amphibians, in August 1926. Prior to the unit deploying to Queensland to survey the Great Barrier Reef with HMAS Moresby, he practiced manoeuvres around the centre of Melbourne, landing in the Yarra River near Flinders Street Station. Media criticism of the escapade led to him being brought before the Chief of the Air Staff, Group Captain Richard Williams, who rather than upbraiding Hewitt expressed himself [...] "reservedly <b>pleased</b> <b>about</b> the publicity". After completing its survey work in November 1928, the unit served aboard the seaplane carrier HMAS Albatross.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} morning, {{they moved}} their camp {{to the river}} bank to facilitate easier watering of their stock.

According to Rose, upon hearing of the emigrants plans the chief gave them, [...] "a very searching look, as if not half believing it".

500|$|During {{the pitch}} {{meeting at the}} Groucho Club, Ptaszynski {{realised}} that Moffat was talking passionately about his impending divorce and suggested that he write about that instead of his initial proposal, a school sitcom. Taking Ptaszynski's advice, Moffat's new idea was about [...] "a sitcom writer whose wife leaves him". Speaking about the autobiographical elements of the show, the writer jokes {{that he has to}} remember that his wife didn't leave him for an estate agent; his wife was an estate agent. In 2003, Moffat told The New York Times that his [...] "ex-wife wasn't terribly <b>pleased</b> <b>about</b> her failed marriage being presented as a sitcom on BBC2 on Monday nights". In an interview with Richard Herring, Moffat says that [...] "the sit-com actually lasted slightly longer than my marriage". Conversely, his later sitcom Coupling was based on his relationship with his second wife, TV producer Sue Vertue. Moffat reused the surname 'Taylor', which is Mark's surname in Joking Apart, for Jack Davenport's character Steve in Coupling.|$|E

Once the Mermaid Avenue sessions were completed, Wilco entered Chicago's Kingsize Soundlabs with engineers Dave Trumfio and Mike Hagler to finish Summerteeth. Tweedy and Bennett wanted to start the recording sessions again by experimenting with {{a new approach to}} mixing the songs. Unlike previous material, which was performed live in the studio, the pair heavily overdubbed many of the songs with Pro Tools. As a result, the contributions of other members were diminished. To complement the [...] "bold, but depressing" [...] lyrics, Tweedy relied more heavily on the production skills of the multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett, who played a variety of instruments besides his usual lead guitar and keyboard work, including Mellotron, tambourine and synthesizers. Bennett even played the bass guitar and drums when the bass guitarist John Stirratt and drummer Ken Coomer were not in the studio.

He also liked the detail in the vehicles' skid marks and gradual building disintegration. He wrote that the game's 3D programming was errorless, and was particularly <b>pleased</b> <b>about</b> the game's lack of fog, usually used to cover developer limitations. EGM echoed Schneider's praise of the deep landscapes, which the magazine called [...] "incredible". Scott McCall (AllGame) praised the game's realistic polygonal models and technical prowess, and Steve Polak (The Weekend Australian) wrote that Blast Corps showcased the console's graphics capabilities. Schneider (IGN) described the soundtrack as between [...] "70s pop, disaster movie score, and Country Bear Jamboree". He praised the range of engine, tire screeching, and crashing sound effects.
