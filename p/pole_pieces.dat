The measurements are calibrated against a known standard, such as mercury cobalt thiocyanate, HgCo(NCS)4. Calibration removes the {{need to know the}} density of the sample. Variable temperature measurements can be made by placing the sample in a cryostat between the <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> of the magnet.|$|E
25|$|Higher {{fields are}} {{possible}} by optimising the spherical design {{to take account}} {{of the fact that it}} is composed of point dipoles (and not line dipoles). This results in the stretching of the sphere to an elliptical shape and having a non-uniform distribution of magnetization over the component parts of the sphere. Using this method, as well as soft <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> within the design, 4.5T in a working volume of 20mm3 was achieved by Bloch et al. in 1998, and this was increased further to 5T in 2002, although over a smaller working volume of 0.05mm3. As hard materials are temperature-dependent, refrigeration of the entire magnet array can increase the field within the working area further as shown by Kumada et al. This group also reported development of a 5.16T Halbach dipole cylinder in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, {{the limit}} to the cyclotron's output energy for a given type of {{particle}} is {{the strength of the}} magnetic field , which is limited to about 2 T for ferromagnetic electromagnets, and the radius of the dees , which is determined by the diameter of the magnet's <b>pole</b> <b>pieces.</b> So very large magnets were constructed for cyclotrons, culminating in Lawrence's 1946 synchrocyclotron, which had <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> [...] (15.3 feet) in diameter.|$|E

Occasionally they are mistaken for <b>pole</b> <b>pieces,</b> thus sometimes the P-90 is erroneously said to have eight <b>pole</b> <b>pieces.</b> The [...] "soap bar" [...] nickname most probably comes from its shape and proportions, and that the first P-90s on the original Gibson Les Paul Model of 1952 were white.

2500|$|DC commutating {{electric}} motors, {{if fitted}} with laminated <b>pole</b> <b>pieces,</b> become universal motors {{because they can}} also operate on AC; reversing the current in both stator and rotor does not reverse the motor. However, the now-standard AC distribution frequencies of 50 and 60Hz caused difficulties with inductive reactance and eddy current losses, so many railways chose low AC frequencies to overcome these problems.|$|E
2500|$|The spiral {{path of the}} {{cyclotron}} beam {{can only}} [...] "sync up" [...] with klystron-type (constant frequency) voltage sources if the accelerated particles are approximately obeying Newton's laws of motion. If the particles become fast enough that relativistic effects become important, the beam becomes out of phase with the oscillating electric field, and cannot receive any additional acceleration. The classical cyclotron is therefore only capable of accelerating particles up to a few percent {{of the speed of}} light. To accommodate increased mass the magnetic field may be modified by appropriately shaping the <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> as in the isochronous cyclotrons, operating in a pulsed mode and changing the frequency applied to the dees as in the synchrocyclotrons, either of which is limited by the diminishing cost effectiveness of making larger machines. Cost limitations have been overcome by employing the more complex synchrotron or modern, klystron-driven linear accelerators, both of which have the advantage of scalability, offering more power within an improved cost structure as the machines are made larger.|$|E

50|$|Early EMG pickup {{designs were}} made with a bar magnet inside for two reasons. The first {{reason is that the}} <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> had too much {{magnetism}} on the strings and could cause some lower notes to go out of pitch in a Doppler effect. The second reason is that the <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> can make tuning and placement of the strings much more difficult. Using the bar magnet however gave the strings a more balanced output. The design of the bar magnet gives it a smoother distortion, better sustain through the amplifier, and have less fade onto the strings than the design of <b>pole</b> <b>pieces.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{components}} {{include the}} yoke, the magnetic coil, the poles, the polepiece, and the external control circuitry. The <b>pole</b> <b>piece</b> must be manufactured {{in a very}} symmetrical manner, as this provides the boundary conditions for the magnetic field that forms the lens.

The exact dimensions of the gap, <b>pole</b> <b>piece</b> internal diameter and taper, as well as the overall design of the lens is often performed by finite element analysis of the magnetic field, whilst considering the thermal and electrical constraints of the design.|$|R
