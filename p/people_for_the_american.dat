50|$|Former Representative from Cebu Bartolome Cabangbang {{was one of}} the {{candidates}} in the 1981 presidential election overwhelmingly won by the incumbent president Ferdinand Marcos. This election was boycotted by most opposition parties when their preferred candidate, Benigno Aquino, Jr., was barred from running. Cabangbang's platform of the Philippines becoming the 51st state of the United States earned him a surprising 4% of the vote, attributed to <b>the</b> <b>people's</b> yearning <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> colonial administration in preference to Marcos' just-concluded martial law.|$|R

Critics, such as <b>People</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Way, allege that Focus on the Family encourages Christian teachers to establish prayer groups in public schools. Dobson supports student-led prayer in public schools, and believes that allowing student-led Christian prayer in schools does not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|E

500|$|Ralph M. Rowlett of the University of Missouri wrote {{a review}} of <b>The</b> Bog <b>People</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> journal <b>American</b> Anthropologist.

Praising Glob's use of ethnohistory and epic literature to illuminate the Early Iron Age, he claims that The Bog People represents [...] "one of the best modern ethnographic descriptions of the North Germani of that era" [...] and that it furthermore provides evidence in support of Tacitus' claims. Rowlett goes on to praise Bruce-Mitford's translation, but believes that he has a [...] "slight tendency to over-translate" [...] with place names, and also disagrees with his decision to convert centimeters into inches. Ending his review, Rowlett notes that along with Alfred Deick's catalog of bog bodies, The Bog People represented [...] "a starter for a by no means exhausted field." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bentley's {{works have}} been noted as {{focusing}} on {{what he calls the}} 'different in America' by personifying the unheard people of the United States and capturing the voice of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>for</b> whom <b>the</b> so-called <b>American</b> Dream has not been so charitable and exploring the lives of people of lower socioeconomic standing, Vietnam War veterans, as well as highlighting the struggles of women in contemporary society.

40|$|Nonprofit, {{community-based}} {{housing development}} organizations {{have only recently}} become significant players {{in the provision of}} affordable housing, at least in the United States. Historically, this job was left either in the hands of builders, developers, lenders and landlords of the business sector or in the care of agencies, planners and policymakers of the public sector. Only in the past 30 years has the provision of affordable housing moved beyond the familiar domains of the market and the state. A host of nonprofit organizations is now playing a larger role in constructing new housing, rehabilitating older housing, managing rentals and bringing home ownership within the reach of thousands of <b>people</b> <b>for</b> whom <b>the</b> <b>American</b> dream has proved elusive. The growth of these third-sector organizations has been both rapid and impressive, but it also has been uneven. Across the country, there are places where nonprofit housing development organizations are both plentiful and productive, supported by sophisticated networks of interorganizational collaboration, public funding, private financing and technical assistance. There are many other communities, however, where no nonprofits are engaged in affordable housing or where the ones that do exist are very new or very small, accounting for only a handful of new housing units every year. Lying between these two extremes are those communities where multiple nonprofits of varying size serve a similar geographic area, each producing a modest but respectable number of housing units; each competing for constituents, funding and development opportunities; each struggling to survive. The organizations that find themselves in this uncomfortable situation often confront a special set of challenges. They are productive, but not prolific. They are effective, but not efficient. They are successful, but not sustainable. Indeed, they are frequently quite precarious. The loss of a single staff person, the delay of a single project or the adverse decision of a single funder can threaten not only their short-term chances for success, but their long term prospects for survival. Those who sponsor and fund such organizations sometimes find themselves in a situation where competition among multiple nonprofits is weakening them all. In these cases, the sponsoring and funding organizations have taken different tacks to address this problem. In some cases, they have acted to strengthen every nonprofit, while working to increase the division of labor or the division of territory among them. In other cases, they have acted to strengthen one (or more) nonprofit {{at the expense of the}} others, culling weaker performers from the herd. While these have been the most common approaches <b>for</b> dealing with <b>the</b> weaknesses that organizational competition and duplication can sometimes create, a third alternative has been gaining ground. Multiple nonprofits, operating within the same jurisdiction, are being encouraged to collaborate [...] even to the point of merging their programs, assets and hard-won identities. Why is collaboration gaining in popularity? A financial explanation would be that it is becoming harder to find enough resources to strengthen every nonprofit to the same degree, funding multiple nonprofits to serve a similar clientele in the same locale. There is also the political reality that public and private funders find it difficult to choose easily (or accurately) which nonprofits should live [...] and which should die. There is a practical explanation as well. Collaboration is becoming a strategy of choice simply because it is proving to be an unusually effective way of achieving greater productivity, efficiency and sustainability. When a collaborative (or a merger) is carefully crafted, the nonprofit partners do a better job together than they did apart. This is not true in every case, of course.
