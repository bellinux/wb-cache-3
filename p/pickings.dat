5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring.

Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea.

We do three things in this paper. We first develop a metric to measure the maximum fraction of volume explained by stock picking in a market.

In the United States, for example, stock picking has secularly declined {{from a high of}} 60 % in the 1960 s to a low of 24 % in the 2000 s. Finally, as markets cannot be efficient if everyone believes that they are efficient and, therefore, do no stock picking – the Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) paradox – we ask what is the long-run steady state fraction of stock pickers? We develop a simple theoretical model, and calibrate this model to the United States economy to conclude that stock picking will eventually settle at 11 % of trading volume in the United States.

With the changes in Francia making raiding more difficult, the Vikings turned their attention to England.|$|E

25|$|The {{grey wolf}} {{is an issue}} if not yet a reality in the Tongue River Basin, {{and there have been}} {{unconfirmed}} sightings of wolves in the more remote areas of the basin. Livestock, particularly sheep and calves, are vulnerable to wolves and, according to reports, livestock suffered significant depredations by wolves and coyotes in {{the last part of the}} 19th and the first part of the 20th century. This led to a war on these predators, with bounties paid by livestock associations and state agencies. By the mid-1930s wolves had been exterminated completely in the Tongue River basin (and indeed throughout the stockgrowing west). Times changed, and sympathy grew for the wolf, as well as his cousin the coyote.

25|$|With optimal {{ripeness}} {{and balance}} between acidity and sugars {{being such a}} viticultural priority for Chenin blanc, many growers (such {{as those in the}} Loire Valley) will harvest the grapes in tries or successive <b>pickings</b> through the vineyards. During each series of picking only the ripest clusters or individual grapes are harvested by hand during a period that could last four to six weeks and include three to six passes through the vineyard. For the production of sweet botrytized wines, pickers will look for the grapes that have achieved the necessary amount of the noble rot. In hot and dry years where no noble rot occurs, pickers may leave ripened grapes on the vine long enough to shrivel, or passerillé, where it could later be effected by noble rot. In areas that experience a lot of vintage variation, winemakers may decide on a day by day basis what style and dryness of Chenin blanc they could make, with the grapes harvested during each tries going to different styles of wine. For some producers in Vouvray, which may have up to six tries during harvest, the first few tries could go to sparkling and dry wine production while the later tries could go towards sweet wine production.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION In the 19302 ̆ 7 s when Regionalism was the {{dominate}} {{style in}} American art, Aaron Pyle studied {{with one of}} its leading exponents, Thomas Hart Benton. From Benton he learned a method, a philosophy and a style. Aaron Pyle began each of his paintings {{with a series of}} sketches, preliminary drawings and grisaille studies. The first ideas were drawn in small thumbnail sketches less than two inches square. Second, were larger outline drawings on a grid for enlarging. Third, were tracings which were transferred to illustration board in preparation for a monochrome painting, which was the fourth step in the evolution of a painting. The monochrome was made to establish major light and dark areas and as a check on the design of the composition. This method seems to imply that the artist feared color, and early in his career, Pyle did paint a number of finished pictures in grisaille, e. g. THE BLACKSMITH (catalogue no. 10) and <b>PICKING</b> CORN (catalogue no. 7). However, there is evidence to indicate that he thought about color, because there are index card size paintings in full color which belong to the series of pencil drawings and black and white studies that were made for each painting. Furthermore, it appears that Pyle also executed lithographs of most of his major works. Egg temera was Aaron Pyle 2 ̆ 7 s chosen medium for finished works. Often called a difficult and time consuming technique, one of its chief virtues is its quick drying properties. This, along with it insolubility and capacity to adhere to any surface, render it desirable to many artists. In fact it was the chief artist 2 ̆ 7 s medium of the middle ages. Also, it is transparent, has a smooth surface and a soft brush stroke, which are qualities Pyle liked since his painting method was not one dependent on 2 ̆ 2 in painting 2 ̆ 2 and smooth tonalities, but was rather one based on glazing or overpainting. While it is possible to glaze with oil, it is somewhat difficult because oil dries slowly, and the artist cannot apply the next thin, transparent film of color immediately. Thus, egg tempera suited Pyle 2 ̆ 7 s style and temperament. His careful establishment of all elements in a painting prior to the final picture is an old procedure which now-a-days is usually used only by art students. And in a sense Aaron Pyle was a student all of his life. He followed Thomas Hart Benton 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy of painting American life and agrarian subjects in particular. Benton, a thoroughly urban person, drew his inspiration from a life in which he had little first hand experience. His knowledge of rural life was based on observations made on summer walking trips, motor journeys and memories of a childhood spent in southern Missouri. Pyle, actually was a farmer, a working farmer, who painted only when the chores were done, and the subjects he chose were closely related to his life on the farm. In other words, he followed and believed what his mentor stated were the virtues of rural life and their relation to true artistic expression. The ancient myth on which Benton based his philosophy teaches that life in the city is evil, life in the country is good. Aside from acquiring a method of work and an aesthetic, Pyle also derived a style and palette from Benton. Benton 2 ̆ 7 s style was based on the baroque rhythms of Michaelangelo 2 ̆ 7 s BATTLE OF THE CENTAURS. Aaron Pyle 2 ̆ 7 s style, which is close to Benton 2 ̆ 7 s, however, has forms that are less convoluted and compositions containing fewer elements. In other words, Pyle simplified the Benton style and kept the Benton palette. After the grey pictures of the early forties, cited above, Pyle 2 ̆ 7 s paintings became more colorful; they were based on the three primaries: red, yellow and blue. But the paintings were not bright, because the colors were greyed. That is, a small amount of a color 2 ̆ 7 s compliment was mixed with the color to lower its intensity and brightness. Exceptions to his usual color scheme are paintings for the Omaha World-Herald. These are blond, they lack strong light and strong darks and contrasting colors. All the colors are bleached and of the same intensity. This was done on purpose as an accommodation to the color reproduction process that the newspaper used for its magazine covers...|$|R

25|$|In the Persian Empire, a {{regulated}} {{and sustainable}} tax system {{was introduced by}} Darius I the Great in 500 BC; the Persian system of taxation was tailored to each Satrapy (the area ruled by a Satrap or provincial governor). At differing times, there were between 20 and 30 Satrapies in the Empire and each was assessed according to its supposed productivity. It was {{the responsibility of the}} Satrap to collect the due amount and to send it to the treasury, after deducting his expenses (the expenses and the power of deciding precisely how and from whom to raise the money in the province, offer maximum opportunity for rich <b>pickings).</b> The quantities demanded from the various provinces gave a vivid picture of their economic potential. For instance, Babylon was assessed for the highest amount and for a startling mixture of commodities; 1,000 silver talents and four months supply of food for the army. India, a province fabled for its gold, was to supply gold dust equal in value to the very large amount of 4,680 silver talents. Egypt was known for the wealth of its crops; it was to be the granary of the Persian Empire (and, later, of the Roman Empire) and was required to provide 120,000 measures of grain in addition to 700 talents of silver. This tax was exclusively levied on Satrapies based on their lands, productive capacity and tribute levels.|$|E
25|$|Piracy saw a brief {{resurgence}} {{between the}} end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713 and around 1720, as many unemployed seafarers took to piracy as a way to make ends meet when a surplus of sailors after the war led to a decline in wages and working conditions. At the same time, one of the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht that ended the war gave to Great Britain's Royal African Company and other British slavers a thirty-year asiento, or contract, to furnish African slaves to the Spanish colonies, providing British merchants and smugglers potential inroads into the traditionally closed Spanish markets in America and leading to an economic revival for the whole region. This revived Caribbean trade provided rich new <b>pickings</b> for a wave of piracy. Also contributing to the increase of Caribbean piracy at this time was Spain's breakup of the English logwood settlement at Campeche and the attractions of a freshly sunken silver fleet off the southern Bahamas in 1715. Fears over the rising levels of crime and piracy, political discontent, concern over crowd behaviour at public punishments, and an increased determination by parliament to suppress piracy, resulted in the Piracy Act of 1717 and of 1721. These established a seven-year penal transportation to North America as a possible punishment for those convicted of lesser felonies, or as a possible sentence that capital punishment might be commuted to by royal pardon.|$|E

500|$|King {{registered}} {{his fifth}} victory, an LVG, after raiding Armentières on 25July 1918. Four days later, {{he led a}} flight of six Camels from No.4 Squadron escorting Airco DH.9 light bombers of the Royal Air Force in another raid on Armentières. In an action that the Australian official history highlighted as an [...] "example of cool and skilful air fighting", the DH.9s completed their bombing mission while the Camels drove off an attacking force of at least ten German Fokkers, three of the Australians including King claiming victories, without any Allied losses. He destroyed a German two-seater on 3August and another the following day, sharing the second with Herbert Watson. No.4 Squadron was heavily engaged in the Allies' great offensive on the Western Front, [...] launched with the Battle of Amiens on 8August. King was credited with two victories—a balloon and an LVG—near Estaires during a bombing raid on 10August. On 12 and 13August, the Camels of No.4 Squadron operated in a massed formation over Flanders with the S.E.5s of No.2 Squadron AFC, the former's two flights led by Cobby and King, and the latter's by Adrian Cole and Roy Phillipps. <b>Pickings</b> were scarce and No.4 Squadron's only success came {{on the second day}} when King and his flight collectively destroyed a two-seat Albatros.|$|E
500|$|Marín {{arrived at}} Chamula, another Tzotzil town, {{where he was}} {{initially}} met by a peaceful embassy. Marín understood this as the submission of the inhabitants, but he was met by armed resistance {{when he tried to}} enter the province. The Spanish found that upon their approach the Chamula Tzotzil had abandoned their lands and stripped it of food in an attempt to discourage the invaders. A day after their initial approach, Marín found that the Chamula Tzotzil had gathered their warriors upon a ridge that was too steep for the Spanish horses to climb. The conquistadores were met with a barrage of stones, spears, arrows, boiling water mixed with lime and ash, and found the nearby town defended by a formidable [...] thick defensive wall fashioned from stone and earth and reinforced with treetrunks. The Tzotzil mocked the Spanish, hurling small quantities of gold at them and inviting them to try and take the rest that they had within their walls. The Spanish stormed the wall, to find that the inhabitants had left spears planted inside to make the Spanish think that warriors were still defending the town, when they had actually withdrawn under cover of torrential rain that had interrupted the battle. After taking the deserted Chamula, the Spanish expedition continued against their allies at Huixtan. Again the inhabitants offered armed resistance before abandoning their town to the Spanish. Conquistador Diego Godoy wrote that the Indians killed or captured at Huixtan numbered no more than 500.
