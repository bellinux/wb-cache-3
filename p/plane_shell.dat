30|$|Turning gait is very {{important}} for the mobility of robot. Since each ePaddle-EGM module only has three DOFs in the <b>plane</b> of <b>shell,</b> the leg (supporting paddle) actuation is limited to motion in the sagittal plane. However, via differential motion between left and right modules, it is possible for ePaddle-based hexapod robot to realize turning motion. Due to unidirectional rotation of all the actuators during the legged gait, each ePaddle-EGM module cannot move in the opposite direction. Hence, the robot cannot turn in place. But through configuring different strides for legs of both sides, the robot can turn during running. In order to verify the ability to turn, the robot is simulated to turn with varying radii in this paper.|$|R

The shell of M. muralensis is composed of dense phosphatic layers interspersed with porous organic-rich layers. At the insertion of shell-penetrating tubes, shell layers deflect inwards to produce inwardly pointing cones. The tubes are interpreted as having hosted setae that were secreted by outer-epithelial follicles. Follicular setae also occurred at the mantle margin, where they were oriented within the <b>plane</b> of the <b>shell</b> as in modern brachiopods. During ontogeny, the initial setae oriented in the <b>plane</b> of the <b>shell</b> occurred before the first shell-penetrative setae. In the juvenile and early-mature stages of shell secretion, a posterior opening was present between both valves and {{was used for the}} protrusion of an attachment structure.

Based on the posterior margin and the shell microstructure, a close relationship between Mickwitzia and the paterinids is proposed with differences interpreted as heterochronic.
