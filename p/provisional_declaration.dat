Gaddafi and his companions intended to achieve this through [...] "social justice, high levels of production, the elimination of all forms of exploitation and the equitable distribution of national wealth".|$|R

The view was not shared by the Holy See and many Polish priests, such as Stefan Wyszyński, who considered the concordat to have been ended by only the Polish side by a declaration.|$|R

It defined {{the powers of the}} executive and judiciary, and stipulated presidential and legislative election processes, paving the way for the 2011 parliamentary elections and the 2012 presidential election. It required that the newly elected parliament form a new constitutional drafting committee - the Constituent Assembly of Egypt - to write a permanent constitution for Egypt. On November 30, 2012, a draft constitution was approved by the Assembly.|$|E
40|$|Rinderpest {{caused by}} a Paramyxoviridae Morbillivirus is {{considered}} as a highly contagious disease, which can affect the susceptible cattle. The {{first step in the}} sero-surveillance consists of subjecting cattle herds to mass vaccination against Rinderpest. The countries that joined the regional programs intending to control and limit any spread of this plague undertook this action. The following step required the monitoring of the rate of immunity in the previously vaccinated cattle by conducting sero-surveillances. Consecutively, other regional programs destined to fulfill this need were planned by the Joint FAO/IAEA division as the project RAW / 5 / 004 entitled “Support for Sero-Surveillance against Rinderpest ” for the west Asia region. Lebanon located in the West Asia region and being twice subject to Rinderpest outbreaks in the last thirty years, joined both WARECC and RAW/ 5 / 004 programs. Accordingly, around 37 % of the Lebanese cattle were vaccinated in a campaign organized in 1993 by the FAO and implemented by the veterinarians of the Ministry of Agriculture. Some 1249 cattle blood samples were gathered from all Lebanese districts {{with the help of the}} local veterinarians. Sera were extracted from these samples and were later on tested in the laboratory using the competitive ELISA technique. The basic principle of this test relies on the specific Rinderpest antibodies detection in the cattle sera. The obtained results following these tests showed that only around 21. 6 % of the total Lebanese herds are immune against Rinderpest. However, since no disease outbreaks have been reported two years after the vaccination campaign <b>Provisional</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Freedom from Disease is foreseeable in the near future...|$|E

This involved troops based in Northern Ireland reduced to 5,000, and only for training purposes. Security was entirely transferred to the police. The Northern Ireland Resident battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment — which grew out of the Ulster Defence Regiment — were stood down on 1 September 2006. The operation officially ended at midnight on 31 July 2007, making it the longest continuous deployment in the British Army's history, lasting over 38 years.|$|R
40|$|Transfer {{pricing and}} customs {{valuation}} rules, are both ultimately aimed at ensuring a transaction with an associated enterprise or related party is conducted at arm?s length. The {{literature on the}} intersection of these rules has identified, on the one hand, the potential for double taxation and, on the other hand, exploitation {{of the differences in}} these regimes by taxpayers. After identifying the obstacles to harmonisation of customs valuation and transfer pricing rules and the opportunities for applying these rules in a harmonised way (in order to manage the risks associate with these rules), this mini-dissertation critically analyses the South African income tax and customs legislation and evaluates it by way of a case study based on the author?s recent experience. This analysis and case study illustrates that in general transfer pricing documentation cannot be used to show that the transaction value of the imported goods is arm?s length and that the prospects for harmonisation of transfer pricing and customs valuation rules in South Africa are poor. The means of managing the transfer pricing and customs valuation risks identified in the existing literature and the case study are further analysed to identify whether they are feasible in South Africa. It is established that importers should incorporate information relevant to customs authorities in their transfer pricing documentation and use <b>provisional</b> <b>declarations</b> where future transfer pricing adjustments are expected. The importer should also evaluate its transfer prices continually in order to avoid year-end transfer pricing adjustments. Mini Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

He supported the dispersion of the population, giving preference to the periphery rather than the center area. He was among the activist members of the party, taking an ardent pro-American stand in the struggle against Mapam, regarding Israel's relation with the United States and the Soviet Union. When MK Yaakov Hazan said that the USSR is his second homeland, Livneh said command positions are not to be put in the hands of people with more than one homeland.|$|R
