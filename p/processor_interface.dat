5000|$|The Hub ASIC {{interfaces}} the processors, {{memory and}} XIO to the NUMAlink 2 system interconnect. The ASIC contains five major sections: the crossbar (referred {{to as the}} [...] "XB"), the I/O interface (referred to as the [...] "II"), the network interface (referred to as the [...] "NI"), the <b>processor</b> <b>interface</b> (referred to as the [...] "PI") and the memory and directory interface (referred to as the [...] "DM"), which also serves as the memory controller. The interfaces {{communicate with each other}} via FIFO buffers that are connected to the crossbar. When two processors are connected to the Hub ASIC, the node does not behave in a SMP fashion. Instead, the two processors operate separately and their buses are multiplexed over the single <b>processor</b> <b>interface.</b> This was done to save pins on the Hub ASIC. The Hub ASIC is clocked at 100 MHz and contains 900,000 gates fabricated in a five-layer metal process.|$|E

The HPC interfaces primarily between the GIObus and the Ethernet, SCSI (wd33c93 chipset) and the 56000 DSP. The GIO bus interface is implemented by the PIC (<b>Processor</b> <b>Interface</b> Controller) on IP12 and MC (Memory Controller) on IP20.|$|E
50|$|The USRP {{product family}} {{includes}} {{a variety of}} models that use a similar architecture. A motherboard provides the following subsystems: clock generation and synchronization, FPGA, ADCs, DACs, host <b>processor</b> <b>interface,</b> and power regulation. These are the basic components that are required for baseband processing of signals. A modular front-end, called a daughterboard, is used for analog operations such as up/down-conversion, filtering, and other signal conditioning. This modularity permits the USRP to serve applications that operate between DC and 6 GHz.|$|E

Besides these, classical computer interfaces such as USB, SATA and PCI Express are also defined.|$|R
50|$|To this end, a Host <b>Interface</b> <b>Processor,</b> an {{embedded}} RISC core, is used {{to fetch}} display list objects using direct memory access (DMA).

According to The Economist, [...] "the two would co-invent Ethernet, with Mr Metcalfe generating the ideas and Mr Boggs {{figuring out how to}} build the system." ...|$|E
50|$|Other {{communications}} standards {{based on}} high bandwidth serial architectures include InfiniBand, RapidIO, HyperTransport, Intel QuickPath Interconnect, and the Mobile Industry <b>Processor</b> <b>Interface</b> (MIPI). The differences {{are based on}} the trade-offs between flexibility and extensibility vs latency and overhead. For example, adding complex header information to a transmitted packet allows for complex routing (PCI Express is capable of this through an optional End-to-End TLP Prefix feature). The additional overhead reduces the effective bandwidth of the interface and complicates bus discovery and initialization software. Also making the system hot-pluggable requires that software track network topology changes. InfiniBand is such a technology.|$|E

50|$|Where {{previous}} POWER processors use the GX++ bus {{for external}} communication, POWER8 removes {{this from the}} design and replaces it with the CAPI port (Coherent Accelerator <b>Processor</b> <b>Interface)</b> that is layered on top of PCI Express 3.0. The CAPI port is used to connect auxiliary specialized processors such as GPUs, ASICs and FPGAs. Units attached to the CAPI bus can use the same memory address space as the CPU, thereby reducing the computing path length. At the 2013 ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference, IBM and Nvidia announced an engineering partnership to closely couple POWER8 with Nvidia GPUs in future HPC systems, with the first of them announced as the Power Systems S824L.|$|E

5000|$|The {{file store}} {{provides}} long term storage (disk storage) of the processor programs (program store) and office data (call store). It was first implemented using disk technology but {{was replaced by}} the 4E attached processor system (4EAPS). The 4EAPS is a 3B computer running 4EAPS application software on the DMERT operating system. The 4EAPS interfaces to the 4ESS processor via the attached <b>processor</b> <b>interface</b> (API) units. The [...] "1A file store" [...] became partitions on the 3B computer disks.At first the 4EAPS just provided [...] "file store" [...] but soon it also provided access to the common-network interface ring (CNI ring) to provide common-channel signaling (CCS).

50|$|The Bedrock ASIC {{connects the}} processors, local and {{directory}} {{memory and the}} Crosstown2 interface to the NUMAlink 3 system interconnect using a crossbar.
