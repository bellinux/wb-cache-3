40|$|We use a {{model of}} {{international}} and domestic tourist numbers and flows to forecast tourist numbers and emissions from international tourism out to 2100. We find that between 2005 and 2100 international tourism grows {{by a factor of}} 12. Not only do people take more trips but these also increase in length. We find that the growth in tourism is mainly fuelled by an increase in trips from Asian countries. Emissions follow this growth pattern until 2060 when emissions per <b>passenger-kilometre</b> start to fall due to improvements in fuel efficiency.

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} the methodologies used in current {{practice}} might lead to an underestimation of energy consumption by different passenger transport modes, and also offers recommendations for improvements to these methodologies. The first recommendation is related to energy consumption rates. The studies reviewed use traditional energy consumption rates based on transportation demand, such as kilowatts-hour per vehicle-kilometre or kilowatts-hour per <b>passenger-kilometre,</b> and include other rates based on transportation supply which might prove useful. Second, energy consumption rates are dependent on factors, {{and the introduction of}} homogeneous units which are independent of these factors therefore offers a significant improvement when comparing transport modes. Third, the use of a vehicle energy consumption equation will improve the quality of the assessments. Fourth, we propose that the coefficients which define the energy consumption equation should be broken down to determine market niches and sources for improvements in energy consumption in the vehicle categories...|$|E
40|$|Greenhouse gas {{emissions}} from international transport contribute to anthropogenic global warming, yet these emissions are not liable under the Kyoto Protocol. International attention {{is being given}} to quantifying such emissions. This paper {{presents the results of}} research into international cruise ship journeys to and from New Zealand. CO 2 emissions from such journeys were calculated using an activity based, or "bottom-up", model. Emissions factors for individual journeys by cruise ships to or from New Zealand in 2007 ranged between 250 and 2200 Â g of CO 2 per <b>passenger-kilometre</b> (gÂ CO 2 per p-km), with a weighted mean of 390 Â g CO 2 per p-km. The weighted mean energy use per passenger night for the "hotel" function of these cruise vessels was estimated as 1600 Â MJ per visitor night, 12 times larger than the value for a land-based hotel. Using a simple price elasticities calculation, international cruise journeys for transport purposes were found to have a greater relative decrease in demand than plane journeys when the impact of carbon pricing was analysed. The potential to decrease the CO 2 emissions per p-km was examined, and if passenger accommodation was compacted and some luxury amenities dispensed with values similar to those of economy-class air travel were obtained.

40|$|There is {{a crisis}} in {{transport}} internationally as the continuing proliferation of car-use undermines environment, society and economy. Cycling has gained considerable attention in policy and academia {{in recent years as}} one alternative mode of travel, yet conflict with motorised vehicles and resulting concerns for safety are inhibiting development of this mode. Greenways, as routes for non-motorised travel, offer extensive benefits for the environment, quality of life, tourism and transport; yet their planning and design for cycling has not been thoroughly researched. A review of cycling network planning (including discourse on segregation, vehicular cycling, the hierarchy and challenges facing route selection) highlighted the need for new methods for greenways to focus on safety, environmental impact and economic impact as well as integrating the unique design requirements of cyclists. To this end, the thesis comprises four empirical elements, which are subsequently distilled into a framework for the planning and design of greenways. Firstly, a mental mapping and modelling approach was developed to identify the determinants of perceived cycling risk, considering both infrastructural and individual effects. A survey (n= 104) of cyclists in Galway City (Ireland) collected mentally-mapped perceived risk observations (n= 484) and these were matched in ArcGIS to road data extracted from a transport infrastructure inventory. Initial comparison between perceived risk hotspots and locations of cycling collisions showed some alignment between the perceived and objective environment. A Generalised Linear Mixed Model in SPSS revealed the infrastructural and individual determinants of perceived cycling risk to be segregation of infrastructure, road width and the volume of motorised traffic as well as gender and cycling experience. The results illustrate the potential for improved cycling experience in areas well-separated from traffic (e. g. greenways) and the added benefits that these environments can present for women and inexperienced cyclists. Secondly, an international greenway survey was piloted and deployed online to determine end-user design preferences, receiving 1, 002 responses from over 20 countries. Coded qualitative responses initially highlighted high-level user priorities for greenway functions and design priorities. Preferred design characteristics (surface, gradient, width, junctions), facilities (resting areas, food & drink) and other preferences (segregation, parking) were quantified and compared with best-practice. To account for variation in design preferences according to mode of travel, a logistic regression model was built for one design characteristic, surface materials, finding that cyclists, commuters and older people prefer asphalt. Building on existing matrices from engineering guidance, these preferences were incorporated into a framework for the route selection and design of greenways, including as elements: accessibility, safety, user experience, design, environment and economy. This framework facilitates the inclusion of quantitative metrics in a broad route selection methodology, which also allows scope for engineering judgement. Thirdly, life cycle assessment was used to measure greenway embodied carbon and to develop a balance sheet for the environmental impact of greenways. This approach is predicated on the fact that while modal shift to cycling has the potential to reduce carbon emissions, the carbon footprint of constructing new cycling routes, particularly greenways, can negate these savings. Applying life cycle assessment to the Great Western Greenway (GWG; Co. Mayo, Ireland), embodied carbon due to materials, construction machinery, transport of materials and removal of vegetation and peat was calculated to be 67. 6 tCO 2 e/km. Furthermore, the carbon savings of shifting one <b>passenger-kilometre</b> travelled (PKT) from driving a car to cycling were found to average 134 gCO 2 e. In this case study, a shift of 115 commuters per year (253, 000 PKT) is required to âbalanceâ or offset the carbon footprint ofone 10 km asphalt greenway (over 20 year life cycle). Fourthly, greenway spending data was derived from the international greenway survey and was used to develop some indicators for the economic impact of these routes. Greenways are comparatively expensive cycling routes to deliver (â¬ 100, 000 /km) and a strong emphasis is placed on demonstrating return on investment. Concentrating initially on the GWG, the average user spend per night was calculated to be â¬ 51, confirming earlier findings of economic consultants. Expanding the analysis to the international sample, {{it was found that the}} average spend for a greenway user is â¬ 47 per night, with accommodation and food & drink accounting for the largest proportions. A Travel Cost Model was then built in SPSS to measure the value of greenway recreation to cyclists showing that the consumer surplus retained by greenway users is particularly high: â¬ 77 or 83 % of the total value. Meanwhile, the study found broad opposition to direct payment for greenway access. The results show the importance of greenways as a recreational and tourism resource. Finally, the four empirical elements were combined as part of a framework for the planning and design of greenways and this framework was used to analyse the development of the burgeoning 2, 000 km Irish National Cycle Network (NCN). The framework was tested against a case study of the Oranmore to Mullingar section of the Galway to Dublin Greenway, which has recently completed the route selection process, yet faces many engineering, economic and land acquisition challenges. Dividing the study area into three sections, route constraints/opportunities, route options and a preferred route were successfully identified and the result is compared with the output from engineering consultants. Overall, the guidance developed in this thesis will be a major asset to local authorities, engineering consultancies and community groups, enabling the design of safe, environmentally-friendly, cost-efficient and well-used greenways...|$|E

30|$|It can be {{observed}} that, on a global level, the goodness of fit between modelled transport performance and ICAO data is within a range of 5 %.

The total tonne-kilometres (RTK) calculated are very close to the reference, but given the incomplete coverage of all-cargo flights in our model, this seems to be consistent with the slightly overestimated ASKs and RPKs. Looking at the reference data from another angle, it is also questionable whether data published by ICAO can be considered as 100 % accurate. This is because ICAO is dependent on data delivered by its contracting states as well as on data availability. As a result, the quality of ICAO data is likely to be rather heterogeneous.|$|R
