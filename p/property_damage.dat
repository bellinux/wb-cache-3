5|$|June 29, 1994: A strong {{microburst}} {{accompanied by}} an F0 struck Avon. Many trees were downed, but {{there was very little}} <b>property</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Less severe <b>property</b> <b>damage</b> was {{recorded}} {{west of the}} storm's track into St. Margarets Bay and Mahone Bay. In addition to Halifax Regional Municipality's urban core, the town of Truro and all of rural Colchester County {{as well as the}} western part of Pictou County experienced <b>property</b> <b>damage</b> and power outages from falling trees; numerous barns and other agricultural buildings were damaged east of the storm's path, including a replica of the Hector in Pictou Harbour. The severity of <b>property</b> <b>damage</b> in the metropolitan areas of Halifax and Dartmouth of Halifax Regional Municipality initially led some forecasters to believe that Juan was likely a Category3 hurricane; however, the sustained wind reports did not justify that suggestion. Many of the deciduous trees in central Nova Scotia still had leaves, which magnified the effects of wind damage. Overall, the number of damaged trees was estimated to be in the millions.|$|E

5|$|Although Gordon was a {{tropical}} storm {{for most of its}} existence, it caused enormous damage and loss of life. The United Nations estimated death toll in Haiti was 1,122. Six deaths were reported in Costa Rica, five in the Dominican Republic, two in Jamaica, two in Cuba, and eight in Florida. <b>Property</b> <b>damage</b> to the United States was estimated at $400million (1994 USD, $ USD). <b>Property</b> <b>damage</b> statistics for the other affected areas are not available, but were reportedly severe in both Haiti and Cuba. The high death toll from Gordon made it the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane David in 1979, which killed thousands in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{widespread}} <b>property</b> <b>damage</b> and extensive death tolls the name Isabel was retired after the 2003 season, {{and will not}} be used for future Atlantic hurricanes. It was replaced by Ida for the naming list for the 2009 season. The names Ina and Ivy were also suggested as possible replacement names.|$|E

5|$|Charley devastated Southwest Florida, causing $14.6billion in <b>property</b> <b>damage</b> on the {{peninsula}} of Florida alone. Many towns such as Punta Gorda and Port Charlotte were leveled by the hurricane. Trees were downed and trailer parks were obliterated as far as Ormond Beach.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Donna {{was a very}} {{destructive}} hurricane {{that caused}} extensive damage from the Lesser Antilles to New England. At least 364 people {{were killed by the}} hurricane and <b>property</b> <b>damage</b> was estimated at $900 million (1960 USD).|$|E
5|$|In nearby Macao, minor <b>property</b> <b>damage</b> was {{reported}} and 15 people were initially rendered as missing.

5|$|Overall, damage {{amounted}} to $9.6million; including $4million in <b>property</b> <b>damage.</b> Moreover, 18individuals were injured. Around 220,000were homeless. In all, 5,365homes were damaged due to Typhoon Faye. Although the typhoon passed {{well to the}} south of Japan, Faye killed two people there, including one due to a landslide.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} had {{devastating effects}} on the places it hit. It killed at least 1,000people directly, {{and a total of}} 1,800 people. At that time, it was Mexico's worst natural disaster in recent times. Most of the destruction was in Colima and Jalisco. A preliminary estimate of <b>property</b> <b>damage</b> was $280million (1959USD).|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Azores, the extratropical {{remnants}} of Tanya produced high winds.

5|$|As a {{tropical}} cyclone Bud did not impact land Bud remained away from land, no effects, <b>property</b> <b>damage</b> or fatalities were reported; no ships were affected, and no tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued. The remnants of Bud later brought light rainfall to the Hawaiian islands on July 19, {{two days after}} it dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Climate-related natural {{disasters}} cause massive losses of Indian life and property. Droughts, flash floods, cyclones, avalanches, landslides {{brought on by}} torrential rains, and snowstorms pose the greatest threats. Other dangers include frequent summer dust storms, which usually track from north to south; they cause extensive <b>property</b> <b>damage</b> in North India and deposit large amounts of dust from arid regions. Hail is also common in parts of India, causing severe damage to standing crops such as rice and wheat.|$|E

40|$|Flooding {{inundation}} during hurricanes {{has been}} very costly and dangerous. However, the impact of climate change on hurricane flooding is not well understood at present. As sea surface temperatures increase, {{it is expected that}} hurricane intensity will increase and sea levels will rise. It is further hypothesized that climate change will increase hurricane flooding inundation, which would increase <b>property</b> <b>damages</b> and adversely affect a greater number of people. This thesis presents a case study of Corpus Christi, Texas, which analyzes the impact of climate change on hurricane flooding. Sea level rise projections and intensification of historical hurricanes were considered in this study. Storm surges were determined with the ADCIRC numerical model, while GIS was used to estimate area flooded, <b>property</b> <b>damages,</b> and population affected. Flooding inundation, <b>property</b> <b>damages,</b> and number of people affected by flooding increases as the intensity of the hurricane increases. As hurricane intensity increases and sea levels rise, the depth of flooding also increases dramatically. Based on two historical hurricanes and one shifted historical hurricane, on average the inundated area increases about 11 km 2 per degree Celsius of sea surface temperature rise, the <b>property</b> <b>damages</b> increase by about $ 110 million per degree Celsius of sea surface temperature rise, and the number of people affected by flooding inundation increases by about 4, 900 per degree Celsius of sea surface temperature rise. These results indicate that it may become necessary to consider the effects of climate change when building future coastal communities and adapting the protection of existing communities...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{remaining}} offshore, most of {{the island}} felt David's effects. Agricultural damage was severe, and combined with <b>property</b> <b>damage,</b> the hurricane was responsible for $70 million in losses ($200 million in 2005 USD). Following the storm, the FEMA declared the island a disaster area. In all, Hurricane David killed seven people in Puerto Rico, four of which resulted from electrocutions.|$|E
5|$|Early in its {{developmental}} stages, Imbudo affected {{portions of}} Micronesia, particularly Ulithi. There, a weather station measured a peak wind gust of 85km/h (53mph); winds of similar intensity {{were reported in}} Yap. Rainfall from Imbudo in Micronesia peaked at 226mm (8.89in) over a six-hour period on Yap. The rainfall from the passing tropical cyclone caused $75,000in <b>property</b> <b>damage</b> and $25,000in agricultural and crop-related damage.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Paul {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} along its path through Baja California Sur. At least 85 homes in La Paz sustained damage, and many telephone {{lines in the}} region were down {{at the height of}} the storm.
