The cause was a high <b>pressure</b> <b>alarm</b> that was caused by the shutting of a turbine bypass valve. The reactor was at 12% of full power when the alarm occurred at 4:03am (local time) due to a pressure increase to 1,030 psi (7,100 kPa), exceeding the regulatory limit of 1,002 psi (6,910 kPa). The reactor was reduced to 0% power, which exceeded the 5% threshold that requires event reporting, and pressure dropped back under the regulatory limit at 4:25am. Later, at 8:49am the control blades were completely inserted, constituting a manual reactor shutdown. An inspection then confirmed that one of the 8 bypass valves had closed and that the valve had a bad driving fluid connection. The reactor had been starting up following its 25th regular inspection, which had begun on October 18, 2008.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the mill water pumping systems at a North American manufacturing facility was conducted late las year and the following issues were observed: 1. Overpumping ? Both systems were overpumped to a significant degree against their calculated design conditions. As observed, each system was running + 1 pump more than required to meet the requirement. System 1 was overpumped by 25 %, or 1100 GPM, and System 2 was overpumped by 37 %, or 1850 GPM. Both systems may provide adequate heat rejection while operating three pumps each. 2. Check Valve induced Pump Failure ? While attempting to take readings, both systems exhibited check valve failure to hold. This failure causes significant short-circuiting of water to the cold well, causing flow instabilities, surging, and low <b>pressure</b> <b>alarms.</b> Finally, water flow reversals cause significant and premature damage to vertical turbine pumps not equipped with non-reversing ratchets. It is advisable to revise operational sequence to eliminate pump staging to minimize future pump failures. 3. High Pressure Differentials ?

5000|$|In June 2001 the Nordic Empress {{suffered}} extensive {{engine room}} fire damage while sailing 140 {{miles north of}} Bermuda. Subsequent investigation revealed {{the cause of the}} fire was failure of a loose bolt in a fuel line flange assembly that had been improperly repaired. The broken bolt caused the flange assembly to separate, allowing fuel to leak around the engine. Moments after a low fuel <b>pressure</b> <b>alarm</b> sounded in the engine room, the leaking fuel ignited against the hot engine surfaces, causing a large explosion that was visible on the engine room CCTV. The engines were stopped immediately and all fuel pumps switched off. Crew members attempting to enter the engine area to fight to fire with fire hoses were forced to turn back from the intense heat. 6 minutes into the fire, the engine room overhead fire sprinkler system was activated along with the ship's general emergency alarm. The sprinklers appeared to have extinguished the fire after 4 minutes, and crew once again attempted to re-enter the engine area, only to have the residual fuel in the engine area ignite a flash fire that was quickly extinguished with fire hoses. During the subsequent inspection of the engine room and surrounding areas, burning wires were discovered in an adjacent compartment. The space was evacuated before lowering watertight doors and releasing 885 kg of halon and restarting the overhead sprinkler system. 3 hours after the first fire broke out, the incident was logged as resolved.

DC dysfunction can be diagnosed as frequent arterial and venous <b>pressure</b> <b>alarms,</b> which reveal a high negative outflow pressure {{and an increase in}} venous pressure. DC dysfunction can be indicated by low values of urea reduction in patients on continuous or intermittent RRT techniques [21] or by low Kt/V values in patients on intermittent hemodialysis [22]. In the latter, the delivered RRT dose can be easily estimated by ionic dialysance measurement [23]. The RRT dose should be prescribed before each session of RRT and the actual delivered dose regularly assessed. In the VA/NIH study, there were no differences in outcome between patients receiving a weekly 3.9 Kt/V and a weekly 7.8 Kt/V [24]. It is therefore recommended to deliver a Kt/V of 3.9 per week [5]. In continuous RRT, the VA/NIH study and the RENAL study showed no differences in mortality between doses of 20 ml/kg/h and 35 ml/kg/h nor between 25 ml/kg/h and 40 ml/kg/h [24, 25]. In continuous RRT, it is recommended to deliver an effluent volume of 20 – 25 ml/kg/h [5].

In a randomized controlled study, we evaluated automatic respiratory weaning in ASV for early tracheal extubation after cardiac surgery. Eligible patients were assigned to either an ASV protocol or a standard one consisting of synchronized intermittent ventilation followed by pressure support. Eighteen patients completed the ASV protocol, and 16 completed the standard one. There were no differences between groups in perioperative characteristics, lengths of tracheal intubation and intensive care unit stay, and ventilatory variables, except less peak inspiratory pressure during the initial phase in ASV (17. 5 +/- 0. 8 versus 22. 2 +/- 0. 8 cm H(2) O; P < 0. 01). ASV patients required fewer ventilatory settings manipulations (2. 4 +/- 0. 7 versus 4. 0 +/- 0. 8 manipulations per patient; P < 0. 05) and endured less high-inspiratory <b>pressure</b> <b>alarms</b> (0. 7 +/- 2. 4 versus 2. 9 +/- 3. 0; P < 0. 05). These results suggest that in this specific population of patients, automation of postoperative ventilation with ASV resulted in an outcome similar to the control group. The internal logic of the new device resulted in less manipulation of the setting and alarms that could simplify respiratory management. IMPLICATIONS: Adaptive support ventilation (ASV), a ventilatory mode providing automatic adjustment of the settings was compared with standard management for rapid tracheal extubation after cardiac surgery. The two approaches were equal in terms of outcome. In ASV, we observed fewer ventilator settings manipulations and a smaller amount of alarms, suggesting that this automatic mode may simplify postoperative respiratory management without delaying extubation...|$|R

40|$|Objective　To {{evaluate}} the stability, {{safety and efficacy}} of mobile blood purification system {{in the treatment of}} acute renal failure dog model in the field environment. Methods　The acute renal failure model was established in 4 dogs by bilateral nephrectomy, which was thereafter treated with the mobile blood purification system. The evaluation of functional index of the mobile blood purification system was performed after a short-time (2 hours) and conventional (4 hours) dialysis treatment. Results　The mobile blood purification system ran stably in the field environment at a blood flow of 150 - 180 ml/min, a dialysate velocity of 2000 ml/h, a replacement fluid velocity of 2000 ml/h, and ultrafiltration rate of 100 - 200 ml/h. All the functions of alarming system worked well, including static upper limit alarm of ultrafiltration pressure (> 100 mmHg), upper limit alarm of ambulatory arterial pressure (> 400 mmHg), upper limit alarm of ambulatory venous pressure (> 400 mmHg), bubble alarm of vascular access, bubble alarm during the infusion of solutions, <b>pressure</b> <b>alarm</b> at the substitution pump segment and blood leaking alarm. The vital signs of the 4 dogs with acute renal failure kept stable during the treatment.

Objectives To test the effect of an intervention (adding or removing air) on the proportion of time that cuff pressure was between 20 and 30 cm H 2 O and to evaluate changes in cuff pressure over time. Methods A repeated-measure crossover design was used to study 32 orally intubated patients receiving mechanical venti-lation for two 12 -hour shifts (randomized control and interven-tion conditions). Continuous cuff pressure monitoring was initiated, and the pressure was adjusted to a minimum of 22 cm H 2 O. Caregivers were blinded to cuff pressure data, and usual care was provided during the control condition. During the intervention condition, cuff <b>pressure</b> <b>alarm</b> or clinical triggers guided the intervention. Results Most patients were men (mean age, 61. 6 years). During the control condition, 51. 7 % of cuff pressure values were out of range compared with 11. 1 % during the intervention condition (P <. 001). During the intervention, a mean of 8 adjustments were required, mostly to add air to the endotra-cheal tube cuff (mean 0. 28 [SD, 0. 13] mL). During the control condition, cuff pressure decreased over time (P<. 001). Conclusions The intervention was effective in maintaining cuff pressure within an optimal range, and cuff pressure decreased over time without intervention.
