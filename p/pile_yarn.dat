5000|$|A variant knot is the {{so-called}} jufti knot, which is woven around four strings of warp, with each loop of one single knot tied around two warps.

50|$|Men shear {{sheep in}} spring and autumn, while women collect dyestuffs and spin and dye yarn in the spring, summer and autumn. The weaving is {{undertaken}} during winter by the female members of the extended family, girls learning from their mothers and grandmothers and wives assisting their mothers-in-law. The carpet is made on horizontal or vertical looms using multi-coloured wool, cotton or silk yarn coloured with natural dyes. Applying special techniques to create pile carpets, weavers knot the <b>pile</b> <b>yarn</b> around threads of the warp; pile-less carpets are variously made with interlacing structural warps, wefts, and patterning wefts. The cutting of a finished carpet from the loom is an unusually solemn celebration.|$|E
50|$|The upright pile of Turkish rugs usually {{falls in}} one direction, as knots are always pulled down before {{the string of}} <b>pile</b> <b>yarn</b> is cut off and work resumes on the next knot, piling {{row after row of}} knots on top of each other. When {{touching}} a carpet, this creates a feeling similar to stroking an animal's fur. This can be used to determine where the weaver has started knotting the pile. The pile in Turkish carpets is usually between 2 and 4 mm thick. Coarse nomadic rugs like the Yürük rugs, can be as thick as 12 mm. A special bedding carpet called yatak may reach a pile thickness of 20 to 25 mm.|$|E

Among these fragments, some show depictings of animals, like various stags (sometimes arranged in a procession, recalling the design of the Pazyryk carpet) or a winged mythical creature. Wool is used for warp, weft, and <b>pile,</b> the <b>yarn</b> is crudely spun, and the fragments are woven with the asymmetric knot associated with Persian and far-eastern carpets. Every three to five rows, pieces of unspun wool, strips of cloth and leather are woven in. These fragments are now in the Al-Sabah Collection in the Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah, Kuwait.|$|R
50|$|The {{crafting}} process incorporates {{three basic}} stages: spinning, weaving, and embellishing. Using a hand spindle, a weaver spins coton, camelid fiber, or sheep's wool into a thread and then twists or piles {{two or more}} spun threads together to strengthen the yarn. When she has spun and <b>piled</b> enough <b>yarn,</b> the weaver turns to her loom. Horizontal ground looms are particularly common in the southern Andes, {{where most of the}} chuspas are made. Once the weaver has wraped the loom by continuously wrapping a length of yarn in a figure-eight around the bars {{at each end of the}} loom, she can begin to interlace the weft threads into the warp to create a structure. Although plain weave is the simplest and most common, weavers use a range of more complex weaving techniques in order to achieve the elaborate designs seen in chuspas and other Andean cloth.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the compression properties of acrylic cut-pile carpet consisting of <b>pile</b> <b>yarn</b> with different fibre blend ratios. Acrylic fibres with finenesses of 7. 69, 10. 99 and 16. 48 dtex were selected and then blended at 10 different percentages of blend ratios using the semi-worsted spinning system, and finally 10 two-fold <b>pile</b> <b>yarn</b> samples were produced. In addition typical cut-pile carpet samples with a constant pile density level of 15 pile/cm 2 and pile height of 13 mm were produced by the face to face method. Then the compression behaviour of the carpet samples was evaluated under a constant compression stress of 40. 89 kPa using an Instron tensile tester. The cut-pile carpet compression properties were evaluated using different compression parameters including the energy of compression WC, the decompression energy W′C, the resilience of carpet compression RC and relative compressibility EMC. The experimental results were then statistically analysed using ANOVA and Duncan test methods. The results showed that with an increase in the coarse acrylic fibre component ratio (16. 48 dtex fibre) the yarn specific volume first decreases and then increases.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to study the various moisture absorption characteristics of terry towel fabrics based on 100 % cotton fibres available in the market.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the influence of the structural components, the mechanical wear and the environmental conditions on the mechanical behaviour of third generation artificial turf football fields. Twenty-three football specimens of artificial turf were evaluated according to the standards of quality established by the FIFA Quality Programme for football turf (laboratory test). Mechanical properties were analysed according to moisture, temperature and wear conditions. The structural variables used were: carpet mass sample (g/m 2), pile weight (g/m 2), tuft m 2 sample (tuft/m 2), pile length sample (mm), <b>pile</b> <b>yarn</b> dtex sample (g/ 10, 000 m), infill bulk density sample (g/cm 3), stabilizing bulk density sample (g/cm 3), incorporation of elastic layer. Temperature, in opposite of wear conditions, did not significantly alter the mechanical behaviour of the surface, although humidity reduced the absorption capacity of the artificial turf within the regulatory limits. The characteristics of the structural components can explain up to 78. 1 % {{of the variance in the}} mechanical behaviour of the surface. Therefore, the control and maintenance of the structural components is necessary for guaranteeing a safe and functional mechanical behaviour of the artificial turf surface.

40|$|A {{study on}} Terry woven Fabrics? Dimensional {{stability}} and Areal Density during Wet processing,is a published article of the textile technology department. Experimental work on three fabrics, made from 100 % cotton, with different <b>pile</b> ratios and <b>yarn</b> densities was conducted during wet processing. Areal density, dimensional stability, yarn crimp and yarn densities were investigated at three {{different stages of}} wet processing namely greige state, bleached state and dyed state. Results showed an increase in dimensional contractions as pile ratio was increased. Fabric dimensions were measured after each processing stage, and the widthwise contractions were between 2. 4 % and 7. 9 % for all the fabrics whereas the lengthwise contractions were between 9. 7 % and 14. 6 %. Areal density was determined using two methods thus by manual measurement and also by calculation. The measure and calculated result both showed that the areal density for each fabrics increased during all stages of wet processing. Generally warp crimp was higher than weft crimp for all the three fabrics, at all three stages of fabric ion. Weft crimp was between 2 % and 7 % whereas warp crimp was between 6 % and 14 %. The measured and calculated results were compared and analyzed using regression analysis methods, and {{it was found that}} there was a correlation between the measured and the calculated results. It was concluded that wet processes {{have a significant effect on}} dimensional stability and areal density. Also it was concluded that the effect of wet processing is dependent on the fabric construction parameters which include the <b>pile</b> ratio and <b>yarn</b> density...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the wear of artificial sports pitch materials and characterise the wear mechanisms. The project was in collaboration with Notts Sports Ltd. who wished to compare the performance of existing pitches with potential new, improved artificial sports turfs. The various materials (from different manufacturers, and of differing <b>pile</b> <b>yarn</b> weight and worn in situ and new) were imaged by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to assess the tribological behaviour of the artificial sports turfs. X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was used to assess the structure of the artificial sports turfs. Pin on disk wear testing, tensile and fatigue testing was conducted on the artificial sports turfs to assess the wear life/mechanisms and how the structure performs under loading. Optical and scanning electron microscopy reveal the wear mechanisms can be identified by the damage incurred as either adhesive, or abrasive or both. Additionally a directionality in the mechanical properties of the materials was observed. Visual and structural investigation by X-ray CT revealed a directionality to the materials. X-ray CT also showed inconsistencies in the structure negatively affect the performance of the artificial sports turfs, which was seen to be the case with some tensile and fatigue experiments. MRI was explored but found not useful in assessing the structure of the artificial sports turfs. Wear testing showed different behaviour for differing artificial sports turfs, whilst the tensile and fatigue testing showed the orientation of the samples affects these properties, in that the horizontal orientation was stronger than vertical orientation. Tensile testing revealed the artificial sports turfs behave similarly to randomly orientated short fibre composites. Rawsons artificial sports turfs have more even fibre distribution in the horizontal and vertical directions in comparison to the Leigh Spinners artificial sports turfs, which has led to more uniform mechanical and tribological properties...|$|E
