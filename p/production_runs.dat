5|$|Differences in {{markings}} {{and appearance}} across surviving Type 26 revolvers, {{has led to}} the categorization of <b>production</b> <b>runs</b> into five categories.|$|E
5|$|Broaching is {{used when}} {{precision}} machining is required, especially for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, splines, keyways, and flat surfaces. Typical workpieces include small to medium-sized castings, forgings, screw machine parts, and stampings. Even though broaches can be expensive, broaching is usually favored over other processes when used for high-quantity <b>production</b> <b>runs.</b>|$|E
5|$|At Oak Ridge, uranium slugs were {{irradiated}} for 40 days, {{then left}} {{to cool down}} for 1 to 5 days, then dissolved. Barium then was extracted and the solution evaporated; the solid material was then shipped to Los Alamos. As of 1949, full <b>production</b> <b>runs</b> involved up to 1728 slugs (34.5 batches of 50 slugs). Until 1949 the Oak Ridge production site processed uranium slugs irradiated both on-site and at Hanford; afterward only Hanford material was processed.|$|E
50|$|The 42nd St. Moon (San Francisco) <b>production</b> <b>ran</b> from March 26 - April 13, 1997. The Musicals Tonight! (New York City) <b>production</b> <b>ran</b> in June 2002.|$|R
50|$|The initial <b>production</b> <b>run</b> counted ten {{helicopters}} {{of which}} the first three were used for development, testing and airworthiness tests. The second <b>production</b> <b>run</b> of ten helicopters was undertaken by Aviolanda after Kromhout left the joint venture. This second <b>production</b> <b>run</b> was to be equipped with an uprated ramjet. It is unsure whether the improved ramjet was ever produced.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} selecting the optimal <b>production</b> <b>run</b> for a process with random linear drifts. A cost function per unit of finished product is derived. A search algorithm {{as well as a}} graphical method are suggested to find the optimal <b>production</b> <b>run.</b> Numerical examples are provided to illustrate how to determine the optimal <b>production</b> <b>run.</b> Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the model is performed. ...|$|R
5|$|In April 2013, Nokia {{was granted}} a {{preliminary}} injunction in the Netherlands against STMicroelectronics, which had supplied HTC with microphone components for the device that contained Nokia’s proprietary technology. Despite the injunction being against STM, Nokia still used the injunction to publicly accuse HTC of copying technology from its products. HTC would {{still be able to}} use the remaining microphones it acquired in good faith; the offending component was replaced with an alternative version in future <b>production</b> <b>runs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Klein {{produced}} {{his first}} bicycle frames while {{a student at}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the 1970s, and full <b>production</b> <b>runs</b> of frames began in the 1980s. In 1995 the company was purchased by the Trek Bicycle Corporation, and the original Klein factory at Chehalis, Washington, closed in 2002 as production moved to the Trek headquarters at Waterloo, Wisconsin. Widespread distribution in the United States stopped in 2007, and ceased altogether {{in the rest of the}} world in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Like all {{industrial}} processes, {{injection moulding}} can produce flawed parts. In {{the field of}} injection moulding, troubleshooting is often performed by examining defective parts for specific defects and addressing these defects with {{the design of the}} mould or the characteristics of the process itself. Trials are often performed before full <b>production</b> <b>runs</b> in an effort to predict defects and determine the appropriate specifications to use in the injection process.|$|E
25|$|Early {{production}} guns had a built-up barrel, {{but later}} ones used a monobloc. There were {{problems with the}} breech mechanism early in the <b>production</b> <b>run</b> {{and a number of}} the first year's <b>production</b> <b>run</b> lacked the semi-automatic breech entirely.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an integrated}} model of batch production and maintenance scheduling on a deteriorating machine producing multiple items {{to be delivered}} at a common due date. The model describes the trade-off between total inventory cost and maintenance cost as the increase of <b>production</b> <b>run</b> length. The <b>production</b> <b>run</b> length is a time bucket between two consecutive preventive maintenance activities. The objective function of the model is to minimize total cost consisting of in process and completed part inventory costs, setup cost, preventive and corrective maintenance costs and rework cost. The problem {{is to determine the}} optimal <b>production</b> <b>run</b> length and to schedule the batches obtained from determining the <b>production</b> <b>run</b> length in order to minimize total cost...|$|R
50|$|The {{last season}} starred Janie Dee, Ruby Turner, Philip Quast and Kristin Chenoweth and ran from 5-31 August 2002. Turner's <b>production</b> <b>ran</b> from 12-17 August, while Quast's <b>production</b> <b>ran</b> from the 19-24 August and Chenoweth ending {{the show on}} the 26-31 August.|$|R
5|$|The next year, he {{relocated}} to some disused buildings on his parents' farm in San Martin, California, {{that had previously}} been used for dehydrating prunes. In 1977, he patented use of large diameter aluminum alloy tubes to increase stiffness, and in 1980, he moved from San Jose, California, to Chehalis, Washington. He started <b>production</b> <b>runs</b> of road bicycles in the early 1980s and mountain bikes in the mid 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 32,400 coins {{on which}} Morgan {{had tried to}} keep a higher relief were struck in January 1922. While all were {{believed}} to have been melted, one circulated example has surfaced. Also, high relief 1922 proof dollars occasionally appear on the market and it is believed that about six to 10 of them exist. The new low-relief coins, which Fraser accepted on behalf of the Commission, though under protest, were given limited <b>production</b> <b>runs</b> in Philadelphia in early February. When the results proved satisfactory, San Francisco began striking its first Peace dollars using the low-relief design on February 13, with Denver initiating production on February 21, and Philadelphia on February 23. The three mints together struck over 84million pieces in 1922.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} used for daylight ground attack missions during the Battle of Moscow, but this {{proved to be}} costly since the aircraft was unarmored. Armor and additional guns were retrofitted to the existing aircraft {{to make it more}} effective, but the evacuation of the sole factory building the Pe-3 in October 1941 limited the number of aircraft available and many units of the Soviet Air Forces flying the Pe-3 were either disbanded or converted to other aircraft. Although production was stopped and restarted several times, the aircraft remained in service throughout World War II. Most of the later <b>production</b> <b>runs</b> were given to reconnaissance units.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the first}} days of Johannes Gutenberg, {{proofing}} has just been press proofs - one makes a short run on the press in order to verify {{what is to be done}} on a <b>production</b> <b>run.</b> As technology evolved to lower the per-copy cost of a printing job, the cost of starting a <b>production</b> <b>run</b> continued to rise. Today, it can be very costly to start up a production press, and thus it is cost-prohibitive to run a press proof. While some people may think a press proof is the ultimate proof quality, this is not necessarily so, especially if the <b>production</b> <b>run</b> is done days or weeks later when press conditions may have changed, or the <b>production</b> <b>run</b> is done on a different press than the press proof.|$|R
50|$|During {{a three-year}} <b>production</b> <b>run</b> 239,978 Taunus P2s were manufactured.|$|R

25|$|The CHARMM program allows {{generating}} and analysing {{a wide range}} of molecular simulations. The most basic kinds of simulation are minimizing a given structure and <b>production</b> <b>runs</b> of a molecular dynamics trajectory.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{technology}} has advanced grinding operations to include CNC controls, high material removal rates with high precision, lending itself well to aerospace applications and high volume <b>production</b> <b>runs</b> of precision components.|$|E
25|$|The {{highlight}} of the Drama calendar at Aquinas is the senior school production. This annual event sees students from year 10 to 12 perform a well known musical, presented in the college gymnasium. The <b>production</b> <b>runs</b> over 3 to 4 nights, from Wednesday to Saturday.|$|E

25|$|Renewable {{bushings}} {{are installed}} in liner bushings. This type of bushing {{is used in}} large <b>production</b> <b>runs</b> where a bushing will wear out over time or when multiple renewable bushings are used in one liner to provide various sized holes. There {{are two types of}} renewable bushings: fixed and slip.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} main {{production}} {{families of the}} T-34, each with subvariants. The identification of T-34 variants can be complicated. Turret castings, superficial details, and equipment differed between factories; new features were added {{in the middle of}} <b>production</b> <b>runs,</b> or retrofitted to older tanks; damaged tanks were rebuilt, sometimes with the addition of newer-model equipment and even new turrets.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately {{there are}} {{currently}} no production models of plug-in hybrids or alternative fuel vehicles (other than flex fuel) available from big manufacturers, though both Toyota and General Motors have promised versions around 2010. Fully electric vehicles are available from Tesla Motors for their high priced sports car and also a small city vehicle from Th!nk in Norway, in limited <b>production</b> <b>runs</b> in Norway and the UK.|$|E

Another <b>production</b> <b>ran</b> from November 3, 2011 to late December 2011, starring Heo Young-saeng and Oh Won-bin alternating as D'Artagnan.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{studies the}} optimal <b>{{production}}</b> <b>run</b> length for a deteriorating production system. The optimal warranty cost {{is determined by}} {{a balance between the}} warranty cost of the manufacturer and the buyer during its warranty period. It is assumed that the elapsed time until the production process shift is age dependent and arbitrarily distributed. The objective is to minimize the total cost per item for determining the optimal <b>production</b> <b>run</b> length and the length of time when backorder is replenished. It shows that there exists a unique optimal <b>production</b> <b>run</b> length to minimize the expected total cost...|$|R

25|$|Before printed {{circuits}} (and {{for a while}} after their invention), point-to-point construction was used. For prototypes, or small <b>production</b> <b>runs,</b> wire wrap or turret board can be more efficient. Predating the printed circuit invention, and similar in spirit, was John Sargrove's 1936–1947 Electronic Circuit Making Equipment (ECME) which sprayed metal onto a Bakelite plastic board. The ECME could produce three radio boards per minute.|$|E
25|$|Early <b>production</b> <b>runs</b> of the Xbox 360 are {{equipped}} with a 12x DVD drive, capable of a maximum read rate of 15.85MB/s. The original production DVD drives were manufactured by both LG and Toshiba. Beginning in November 2006, a new model the BenQ VAD6038 was introduced, which is said to run faster than the previous models and, in addition, is much quieter. There is a new drive by LiteOn.|$|E
25|$|In January 1986, Gibson again changed {{ownership}} and began manufacturing {{a range of}} varied Les Paul models. The 1980s also saw the end to several design characteristics, including the volute and maple neck. However, because of consumer demand, the Gibson Les Paul guitar is available today in {{a wide array of}} choices, ranging from guitars equipped with modern digital electronics to classic re-issue models built to match the look and specifications of the guitar's earliest <b>production</b> <b>runs</b> from 1952 to 1960.|$|E
