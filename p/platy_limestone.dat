40|$|Taphonomic {{analysis}} of Lower and Middle Oxfordian ammonites from the Cracow Upland, southern Poland (localities at Podłęże, Zalas, Młynka) revealed differences in ammonite preservation. The studied ammonites, usually termed as {{external and internal}} moulds, show a more complex state of preservation. In the Middle Oxfordian glauconitic marls, ammonites are preserved as internal moulds with neomorphic calcite shells showing relics of the original internal structure. In the Middle Oxfordian <b>platy</b> peloidal <b>limestones,</b> ammonites are preserved mostly as external moulds, without septal suture, however under microscope might show relics of internal whorls and septa and/or subtle differences in sediment filling phragmocone chambers. In sponge–microbial bioherms and biostromes, ammonite internal moulds have shells, {{which in contrast to}} ammonites from glauconitic marls are not strictly neomorphic ones, but originated by shell dissolution and subsequent filling of moldic porosity by calcite cement. In sponge–microbial nodular limestones, the ammonites are strongly deformed and the outer wall is usually removed by dissolution under pressure. Other important taphonomic differences include the rate of compaction (highest in <b>platy</b> <b>limestones),</b> sedimentary infillings, microborings, encrustations and preservation of siphuncular tubes. The majority of the ammonites appear to be phragmocones; aptychi in all facies are rare. Siphuncular tubes are fossilized exclusively in oppeliids, only in specimens from glauconitic marls and <b>platy</b> <b>limestones,</b> although their other taphonomic attributes are different. Tubes seem to have fossilized due to microbially mediated phosphatization that could be favoured by a set of parameters which operated rather at the scale of ammonoid carcasses: closed, poorly oxygenated conditions, and reduced pH. Taphonomic processes were controlled by the sedimentary environment (fragmentation, sedimentary filling, phosphatization of siphuncular tubes), as well as by early and late diagenesis (neomorphic transformation, dissolution, cementation, compaction) influenced by lithology...|$|R

Several large, recent landslides are located in the vicinity of Facey Rock. Portions of the landslide debris along with talus deposits have been cemented into a loose breccia by groundwater supersaturated with calcium carbonate. Thrust faults separate the two limestone members from each other and from the underlying graywacke. They are responsible for the successively older, upward sequence of units observed at Facey Rock.

Only local stones quarried within a distance of ca. 15 km from Krakow were used in early mediaeval edifices in the city. They were: two varieties of limestones (Upper Jurassic) and three varieties of sandstones of the Carpathian flysch (Cretaceous to Palaeogene). Sedimentary environments (facies) and post-sedimentary processes determined compactness, block divisibility and workability of stones, which, further on, determined their application. Thin bedded sandstone and <b>platy</b> <b>limestone</b> yielded easily workable and relatively small (few to a dozen of centimetres in length) and quite regular bricks used in the earliest buildings. Rocky limestone {{was a source of}} irregularly shaped clumps used initially as a filler of walls erected in the opus emplectum technique. Later, it was used also for cutting larger (few tens of centimetres), more regular blocks. Bedded limestone was a good material for obtaining larger (a dozen or two dozens of centimetres) regular bricks used widely throughout the whole early mediaeval period. Blocks (2 or more metres in length) of soft dimension Carpathian sandstone were used for shaping and carving large elements: tombstones, columns, volutes, epitaphs, etc. Techniques of quarrying and stone working developed considerable with time. Initially, slope scree and stone from demolished older ramparts were used. Later, quarries reached deeper beds which yielded larger bricks and blocks. Stone sources "migrated" with time too. The earliest places of excavation were located within the city, e. g. on the Wawel, Skałka and Krzemionki hills. When those deposits were exhausted, mining moved to more distant spots.

40|$|The San Pedro del Gallo area 1. 8 in the north-central part of Mexico, between 25 ° 30 ' and 26 ° 00 ' N latitude, and 104 ° 00 ' and 104 ° 20 ' W longitude. It covers {{approximately}} 1, 900 {{square kilometers}} {{at the western}} edge of the Sierra Madre Oriental. The oldest rocks exposed in the area belong to the Villa Juarez Formation of possible Late Triassic age. These rocks, of continental origin, comprise siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate, tuff, and intercalated lavas of characteristic red color. Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks form a section with a maximum thickness of about 3, 580 m. The sediments were deposited in the Mexican Geosyncline, west of the Coahuila Peninsula of pre-Aptian age. The Villa Juarez Formation is overlain with angular unconformity by orthoquartzite, quartzose sandstone, and limestone lenses of the La Gloria Formation of Oxfordian age. The La Casita Formation, which is stratigraphically above the La Gloria Formation, probably ranges in age from late Oxfordian to early Neocomian. It consists of thin-bedded limestone, black shale, and varicolored sandstone, with intercalations of coal seams and abundant ammonites. The Lower Cretaceous rocks of the area comprise the Coahuila Series, La Pena Formation, Aurora Limestone, and Cuesta del Cura Formation. Neocomian and upper Aptian rocks are represented by thin-bedded limestone, marl, and shale of the Taraises, Las Vigas, Parritas, and La Pena Formations. This sequence of rocks is overlain with apparent conformity by the medium- to thick-bedded bank-type Aurora Limestone of middle to late Albian age. A notable change of facies occurs laterally in the upper Albian and lower Cenomanian rocks, the lithology of the Aurora Limestone grading westward into the thin-bedded limestone with wavy bedding planes and black chert intercalations that characterize the Cuesta del Cura Formation. An erosional unconformity developed on the surface of the Aurora Limestone and Cuesta del Cura Formation is covered by the Indidura and Caracol Formations of Turonian to Coniacian age. These consist or thin-bedded, <b>platy</b> <b>limestone,</b> shale, and marl beds, which grade upward into a thick sequence of poorly fossiliferous calcareous sandstone, siltstone, and shale. A period of intense folding and erosion preceded the deposit of the non-marine Ahuichila Formation, of probable late Eocene and early Oligocene age. This formation was deposited with marked angular unconformity on all the older rocks, including the Villa Juarez Formation. Both, porphyritic and equigranular igneous rocks in the form of dikes, sills, plugs, and stocks intrude the bedded rocks of the area. They range in composition from quartz rhyolite porphyry to andesite and from granadiorite to monzonite. The rocks around the intrusive bodies have been metamorphosed irregularly as far as 100 m from the igneous contacts. Irregular tactite aureoles occur around intrusive bodies in the Descubridora district, west of Cerritos de Los Victorinos, and in the Sierra del Mimbre. Marble and recrystallized limestone is found west of Descubridora and in the Bajio del Bailon, and hornfels has formed in Cerrito de La Cruz and Cerrito de Las Liebres near San Pedro del Gallo, as well as in the southern part of the Sierra del Mimbre. Folowing emplacement of the intrusive bodies mineralizing solutions reacting with sedimentary rocks gave origin to the different mineralized zones in the region. The beginning of the Laramide Orogeny in the San Pedro del Gallo region is marked by Late Cretaceous uplift, which probably continued until middle or late Eocene time. Compressive forces acting in an east-west to northeast-southwest direction folded the Mesozoic strata into a series of narrow asymmetrical anticlines and synclines overturned to the east, with axial, planes almost parallel to the borders of the Coahuila Peninsula. Thrusting and faulting were important in the vicinity of San Pedro del Gallo. There is no conclusive evidence of large-scale post-Triassic and pre-Laramide deformation in the area. Extrusion of lavas ranging in composition from basalt to rhyolite, accompanied by extensive block faulting, occurred during Miocene and Pliocene time. Late Tertiary uplift began during the Pliocene. The streams were rejuvenated and there was increased erosion, which caused, together with a change of climate, the overloading of some streams and local blocking of drainage by alluvial fans in the valleys, giving rise to the Santa Ines Formation. Erosion, more than deposition is the dominant event at present. Contact metasomatic silver, lead, and copper deposits in the Aurora Limestone have been mined in the Descubridora, Parranderas, and Sierra del Mimbre districts. Fluorite and barite have been extracted from veins in the La Gloria Formation and the Aurora Limestone. Thin beds and seams of coal in the La Casita Formation were mined within the town limits of San Pedro del Gallo. No important mining activity exists at present in the area studied.

The central part of the range exposes the Buday'ah section of oceanic sediments in the so-called "Hawasina allochtons". The locality of Wadi Maqam in the north-western part of the Oman Mountains is among places where the thick Permian-Triassic base-of-slope sediments is exposed (Baud et al., 2001). Overlying 400 m of middle Permian limestones and dolomites, the upper Permian sediments consist of 50 m of ≈ 10 cm thick beds of cherts and dolomites rich in sponge spicules. The top of the Permian units is well bioturbated lime mudstone-wackestone, devoid of cherts and dated as late Changhsingian (Krystyn in Richoz et al., 2005). The boundary yellow shales are overlain by very thinly bedded, laminated microbial platy lime mudstone with H. parvus. The dramatic loss of the burrowing infauna indicates the appearance of oxygen-poor water. These Induan sediments are about 25 m thick and show at the top the first calcirudites, commonly clast-supported (edge-wise conglomerates), and are characterized by tabular clasts representing the sub- in situ reworking of the laminated, platy calcilutite.

Micritic limestones pass often more or less abruptly or gradually into predominantly bioclastic <b>limestones.</b> <b>Platy</b> <b>limestones</b> with shale intercalations pass into crinoidal bioclastic limestones. The attempts to explain such rapid facies changes by tectonics, or even by nappe structures, is needless because many examples show that they can be explained by variations in depositional environments and sedimentary mechanisms. The specific and more or less isolated Koněprusy area with its special lithological and stratigraphic development represents a serious problem. However, it can be shown that its isolation is not absolute and many stratigraphic and facies analogues can be found in near and more distant sections. The plausibility of paleogeographical reconstruction of the Devonian basin in central Bohemia is also discussed. It is documented that small relics of Devonian rocks do not allow reliable paleogeographic reconstruction and that the occurrences of Devonian rocks outside the limits of the Barrandian area indicate a presence of large marine basin with a broad gateway to the ocean. Even though shallow-water sedimentation prevailed during the Devonian, there is no indication of the presence of a coast and/or a shoreline.

Occurrences of planktonic foraminifera, radiolarians, calcisphaeres and rare ammonites indicate the sporadic influence of the open sea. Along the margins of the trough, peri-reefal environments were established, with flourishing developments of different reef-building organisms – hydrozoans, stromatoporoids, corals and bryozoans. Reefs were continuously destroyed, and in this way derived material was reworked and transported towards the trough slopes. An enormous quantity of this material caused progradation towards the deeper central part of the area, which was gradually infilled and narrowed. In the final phase, the trough was completely infilled, and peri-reefal environments gradually disappeared, since they were covered by ooid bars, culminating in the establishment of shallow environments over the entire area. A similar situation was recorded in another contemporaneous, also tectonically formed environment – the Lemes trough, stretching from the vicinity of Bihac in NW Bosnia towards the south into Croatia, into E Lika and N Dalmatia. This trough had direct communication with the open Tethys realm, and thin-bedded and <b>platy</b> <b>limestones</b> with chert and pelagic organisms, including common ammonites, were deposited within it. The Lemes trough was also surrounded by coral–hydrozoan reefs, and it was infilled by the same depositional processes as the neighbouring trough in the area of Velika Kapela Mt., and finally covered by shallow-water deposits. Although both troughs were probably formed by the same tectonic act, and had approximately the same duration – during the Kimmeridgian and Early Tithonian – they differ according to their palaeogeographic and facies characteristics. The trough investigated in the Velika Kapela Mt. was isolated, surrounded by shallow-marine platform environments, and had only temporary, indirect contact with the open sea. The Lemes trough had a continuous connection with the open sea, as indicated by the relatively rich assemblages of pelagic organisms, especially ammonites, and is characterised by abundant cherts. However, both troughs are characterised by similar depositional sequences: both are underlain and overlain by shallow-water carbonate deposits, and they represent a consequence of a specific depositional event caused by tectonic deformation (formation of pull-apart basins) within the inner part of the Adriatic Carbonate Platform...|$|R

Their main components are a peneplain crowned by numerous monadnocks, generated as hard-rocks on Upper Jurassic massive limestones (bioherms, carbonate buildups) surrounded by less resistant <b>platy</b> and bedded <b>limestones</b> of the same age. After the Miocene tectonic phase and following karstification deep val-leys dissected the top surface of the plateau and cave levels connected with rocky terraces had been formed. During the Pleistocene the periglacial climate accelerated the congelifraction and relaxation of monadnocks. The modification of landforms and the environment in last ten thousand years, indicated by assemblages of molluscs was controlled by both climatic and anthopogenic factors. The geo- and biodiversity closely related to one another are still under the nature protection...|$|R

One of the project assumptions {{is to create a}} geological path across the object. However, detailed data about the geological structure of this place is not available. For this reason, the author has researched and updated the information about the rocks occurring in the walls of the old quarry. Primarily, terrain (textural and structural analysis, layers strike and dip measurements, geological boundaries delimitation) and laboratory analysis (X-Ray Powder Diffraction, microscopic rock samples analysis) were conducted. Collected data was afterwards compared with available literature. Within the steep slopes of excavation, strong-karsted, faulted Upper Jurassic (Oxfordian) carbonate sediments were revealed. These are massive, <b>platy</b> and crumpled <b>limestone.</b> These rocks could be deposited in changing conditions of sedimentation, when calm carbonate sedimentation was disturbed by underwater gravity flows, as demonstrated by their detrital character. One of the karst funnel on the northern slope was filled with Oligocene sand. As a result, groundwater fluctuations created a sarsen structure, popularly called the “Wielbłąd”. In relation to the planned geological path across the Zalew Balaton area, previous knowledge should be supplemented with new data, respectively processed and included on information panes, located within object. Plans of the path should pay attention to potential geotouristic safety, {{as well as to the}} geological values of the protected object, during its future modernization.

40|$|The Pasoemah region S of the Goemai Mts. in W. Palembang {{is largely}} {{occupied}} by Quaternary volcanics, which form a sharply dissected plateaulike country, whose surface gradually slopes downward in an ENE direction from ± 1000 m to ± 300 m above sea-level, conformably to the courses of the Selangis and Lematang Rivers above {{their point of}} confluence. Where the Lematang River unites with the Moelak River, the acid welded tuffs of the Pasoemah highland, to which attention will be drawn in this paper, are cut off by a steep bluff, formed undoubtedly by retrogressive erosion, which was substantially facilitated {{by the presence of}} vertical cleavage planes in the rhyolitic tuff series. In the Goemai Mts., described elsewhere in detail by K. A. F. R. Musper (1937) and also dealt with by the present writer in a previous paper (J. Westerveld, 1941), a core of strongly folded lower-Cretaceous sediments, cut by various intrusiva, is covered unconformably by a steeply tilted series of Eogene or old-Miocene andesitic tuffs and breccias, the Lower Kikim tuffs, which again are covered with slight unconformity by the old-Miocene Upper Kikim tuffs or basal section of the Batoeradja-Telisa series. The base of the Pasoemah volcanics is generally formed by the S-ward dipping Telisa beds or upper part of the latter series; a monotonous sequence of Globigerina marls and shales with intercalated andesitic tuffs and breccias, layers of glauconitic sandstone, <b>platy</b> or concretionnary <b>limestones,</b> and occasional horizons with plant remains. Below the Quaternary tuff mantles this series unquestionably merges S-ward into the late-Miocene Lower Palembang beds, which only seem to be exposed quite locally {{at the bottom of the}} Selangis gorge NE of Pageralam (Musper, 1937, p. 41). The lower and thickest portion of the flat-lying, post-Tertiary, volcanic sequence is formed by welded rhyolitic tuffs, and the upper part by andesitic tuffs and agglomerates from the andesitic volcanoes, which border the Pasoemah highland on the W (G. Dempo), the S (the volcanoes of the Semendoh highland) and the E (the G. Isau-isau). Of these eruption points the Dempo volcano and the Semendoh volcanoes lie outside the map region...|$|R
40|$|A Middle-Aptian (zone of Palorbitolina lenticularis) „patch reef“ {{of about}} 40 m maximum {{thickness}} with marked morphology was analyzed at the Sabotin Mountain near Nova Gorica. It is developed above an basal unit of superficial oolites within lagoonal sediments and is overlain by shallow subtidal to intertidal sediments which reveal short time periodically subaerial exposure and early diagenetic freshwater influxes (birds eyes, vadose silt, characeans). Above these sediments within {{the zone of}} Salpingoporella dinarica finebedded to <b>platy,</b> laminated bituminous <b>limestones</b> occur. The {{central part of the}} reef structure reveals an alternation of individual lenses of Lithocodium-boundstones and of rudist-beds (up to 4 m thickness) which are separated by coarse- to medium-grained, moderately to poorly sorted bioclastic sands. These faciestypes show also lateral interfingering and are concentrated in {{the central part of the}} buildup where the greatest thickness can be observed and where packstones, grainstones and boundstones prevail. The neighbouring lagoonal sediments which consist of mudstonesand wackestones predominantly were analyzed in the so-called Sabotin-standardprofile which is located north of the patch reef at a lateral distance of about 300 m. Three vertical profiles (A = 90 m, B = 100 m, C = 64 m thickness) were analyzed. The middle profile B of greatest thickness is taken as reference profile and documents best the vertical facies development within the patch reef directly overlying a basal unit of peloidal packstones with superficial ooids. The patch reef itself is characterized by the faunal associations within the unit rich in Lithocodium and rudists. It is overlain by a subtidal unit of peloidal mudstones with very minor biogenic allochems. An intertidal unit above rich in birds-eyes and vadose silt is followed by fine-laminated black shales which are covering the general seqeunce of interfingering patch-reef – lagoonal sediments. Using different time lines (marker horizons) for correlation it can be shown that already very early differential compaction of fine-grained uncemented sediments in comparison to the core area of the patch reef is of great importance. The greater thickness of the patch reef itself is caused by an intensive early diagenetic marine phreatic cementation within the core zone and by the early fixing of sediment by Lithocodium aggregatum (syn. Bacinella irregularis) resulting in a greater resistivity against compaction. Furthermore a lagoonal side and an more open marine side of the patch reef can be determined. Lithocodium aggregatum is the main constructing organism within the buildup investigated, beginning with the incrustation of varying substrates and biogenic particles. Finally, a dense network of encrustation-sequences is formed interfingering with the general sedimentary textures intensively and resulting in larger „biogeniccemented“ patches within the sediment. The correlation of the three profiles A, B, and C allows to reveal the history of differential compaction of the associated lagoonal sediments in comparison to the more massive patch reef limestones. It becomes obvious that the main compaction must have occurred within the time span of about 50 m sediment-deposition overlying the patch reef. Differential compaction resulted in differences in thickness of about 10 m from the patch reef (profile B) to the more lagoonal influenced sediments (profile A) within a lateral distance of about 50 m...|$|R
