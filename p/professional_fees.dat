5|$|The College {{is almost}} entirely self-financed, {{and is not a}} {{recipient}} of any regular public funding. Its officers do have official salaries, which {{are paid for by the}} Crown. The salaries of the officers were raised during the reign of King James I, but were reduced under William IV. These salaries per annum reflected the living costs of the day; however today the amount is seen only as nominal payment. In addition to their official duties, the heralds have for many centuries undertaken private practice in heraldry and genealogy, for which <b>professional</b> <b>fees</b> are charged.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} acute care, both {{clinically}} and economically, {{has meant that}} there is now little opportunity for meaningful observation of the symptomatology of the acute psychiatric patient. The use of psychotherapy too has been de-emphasized, consequent to like motivating factors.

However, due to delays in the progression of the works and unforeseen difficulties - such as ground conditions on the land the station occupies, only discovered after the commencement of work - the company in charge of the development, C Spencer Construction, made a claim for a further £6.3million.|$|E
50|$|Self-referral {{has had the}} {{greatest}} influence on radiology.

Physicians who own imaging machinery can derive profit by collecting both of these fees.|$|R

25|$|Tax {{avoidance}} {{strategies and}} loopholes tend to emerge within income tax codes. They get created when taxpayers find legal methods {{to avoid paying}} taxes.

The vicious cycle tends to benefit large corporations and wealthy individuals that can afford the <b>professional</b> <b>fees</b> that come with ever more sophisticated tax planning, thus challenging the notion that even a marginal income tax system can be properly called progressive.|$|E

AFP Medical Center, St. Luke’s Hospital, Philippine Orthopedic Hospital, University of Sto. Tomas Hospital, East Avenue Medical Center, Cardinal Santos Medical Center, Medical City, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, General Santos Doctors Hospital (GSDH) were investigated for health insurance fraud. In Iloilo, eye-doctor claims for 2, 071 operations in 2006 amounting to PHP16 million in <b>professional</b> <b>fees</b> were also investigated. A hospital in Davao City also noticed that a janitor, not a PhilHealth member, had been lying in bed to claim benefits as a PhilHealth-accredited patient. Also in 2006, PhilHealth revoked the accreditation of Sara Medical Clinic in Midsayap for admitting ghost patients.|$|E

500|$|The club {{took the}} {{land on a}} 21-year lease, and {{entrusted}} the role of surveyor and engineer to a local carpenter, Harry Pumfrey, who {{despite a lack of}} qualifications produced plans [...] "which would have done credit to the most expensive professional architect". Club director Thomas Turley, a builder, acted as clerk of works, and it is estimated the club saved more than £2,000 in <b>professional</b> <b>fees</b> by keeping the work in-house. Tradition has it that gypsies, evicted from the site before work could begin, laid a 100-yearcurse on the club; although gypsies are known to have camped nearby, there is no contemporary evidence for their eviction by the club, and construction began in February 1906.|$|E
500|$|In 1903, {{with the}} design now confirmed, the MDHB {{requested}} {{that a number of}} builders submit a tender document for the construction of the building to the revised design. Over 30 builders were contacted, with William Brown & Son of Manchester winning the contract to construct the new building. Work began in 1904, with {{the first nine months of}} construction focusing on laying the building's foundations, which were dug to a depth of [...] below ground level. The building's frame was built from reinforced concrete, which was then clad in Portland Stone, a design that meant the building was more fire resistant than with other structural forms. It was completed in 1907 at a cost of approximately £250,000, although when the cost of furniture, fittings and <b>professional</b> <b>fees</b> was taken into account, the total cost was nearer £350,000. Staff from the MDHB headquarters officially moved into the building on 15 July 1907, with staff from departments located in other areas of the city moving in throughout the rest of the year.|$|E

60|$|Even dirty Dame Fripp, {{who was a}} {{very rare}} church-goer, had been to Mrs. Hackit to beg a bit of old crape, and with this sign of grief pinned on her little coal-scuttle bonnet, was seen {{dropping}} her curtsy opposite the reading-desk. This manifestation of respect towards Mr. Gilfil's memory {{on the part of}} Dame Fripp had no theological bearing whatever. It was due to an event which had occurred some years back, and which, I am sorry to say, had left that grimy old lady as indifferent to the means of grace as ever. Dame Fripp kept leeches, and was understood to have such remarkable influence over those wilful animals in inducing them to bite under the most unpromising circumstances, that though her own leeches were usually rejected, from a suspicion that they had lost their appetite, she herself was constantly called in to apply the more lively individuals furnished from Mr. Pilgrim's surgery, when, as was very often the case, one of that clever man's paying patients was attacked with inflammation. Thus Dame Fripp, in addition to 'property' supposed to yield her no less than half-a-crown a-week, was in the receipt of <b>professional</b> <b>fees,</b> the gross amount of which was vaguely estimated by her neighbours as 'pouns an' pouns'. Moreover, she drove a brisk trade in lollipop with epicurean urchins, who recklessly purchased that luxury at the rate of two hundred per cent. Nevertheless, with all these notorious sources of income, the shameless old woman constantly pleaded poverty, and begged for scraps at Mrs. Hackit's, who, though she always said Mrs. Fripp was 'as false as two folks', and no better than a miser and a heathen, had yet a leaning towards her as an old neighbour.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the time}} of which I write, the Art of Caricature was just {{approaching}} the close of its colored and most extravagant stage of development. The subtlety and truth to Nature required for the pursuit of it now, had hardly begun {{to be thought of}} then. Sheer farce and coarse burlesque, with plenty of color for the money, still made up the sum of what the public of those days wanted. I was first assured of my capacity for the production of these requisites, by a medical friend of the ripe critical age of nineteen. He knew a print-publisher, and enthusiastically showed him a portfolio full of my sketches, taking care at my request not to mention my name. Rather to my surprise (for I was too conceited to be greatly amazed by the circumstance), the publisher picked out a few of the best of my wares, and boldly bought them of me--of course, at his own price. From that time I became, in an anonymous way, one of the young buccaneers of British Caricature; cruising about here, there and everywhere, at all my intervals of spare time, for any prize {{in the shape of a}} subject which it was possible to pick up. Little did my highly-connected mother think that, among the colored prints in the shop-window, which disrespectfully illustrated the public and private proceedings of distinguished individuals, certain specimens bearing the classic signature of [...] "Thersites Junior," [...] were produced from designs furnished by her studious and medical son. Little did my respectable father imagine when, with great difficulty and vexation, he succeeded in getting me now and then smuggled, along with himself, inside the pale of fashionable society--that he was helping me to study likenesses which were destined under my reckless treatment to make the public laugh at some of his most august patrons, and to fill the pockets of his son with <b>professional</b> <b>fees,</b> never once dreamed of in his philosophy.|$|E
