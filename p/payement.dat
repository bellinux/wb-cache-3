His 1865 Fouilles à Pompéi (Excavations at Pompei) depicts a group of barefoot women carrying baskets over their heads. Other paintings include Le <b>Payement</b> (Rome, 1865), Fileuse à Capri, Romaine (1870), Napolitaine (1870), La Convalescente en pèlerinage à la madone d'Angri (1873), La Marica de Capri (1874), Le Repas de noces à Capri (1875), Jésus et la Samaritaine (1876) and Andromède (1877). He recorded his trip to Italy in an 1879 book, Souvenirs d'Italie. Impressions de voyage.|$|E

40|$|Consulpav {{international}} {{is working}} closely with the University of Minim in Portugal under a contract from the Rubber Pavements Association to develop a mechanistic procedure for overlay design that directly takes into account the mechanism of reflective cracking as well as classical flexural fatigue cracking. The problem of propcrly modeling the mechanism of renective cracking is paniclliarly pre alent in thin asphalt concrete overlays. To correctly model and predict asphalt fatigue mechanisms in overlays (both flexural and reflective cracking). it is necessary to utilize the correct mode of loading in laboratory tests. TIle mode of loading chosen should. as closely as possible. reflect the mode of loading which causes crack propagation in the field For cach of the possible distress mechanisms that cause cracking in pavements. such as thin or thick existing pavement sections. and thin or thick overlays. fatiguc characterization using any model must recognize that controlled stress. strain or "work"' (stress x strain) will inducc significantly different fatigue Ih'es in laboratory tests. As layer moduli are reduced by fatigue mechanisms. it is necessary to invcstigate which of these parameters (stress. strain or work) remains mostly constant in a field situation so that it can bc lIsed as an input control parameter in laboratory fatigue tests. This paper presents a numerical evaluation. through a finite element simulation. of mode of loading for scyeral types of nexible <b>paYements</b> and overlays placed on these pavements. Stress (load). strain (displacemcnt) and work (load x displacement) control modes are investigated...|$|R
5000|$|King Ostoja died in 1418 and the stanak was convoked to {{recognize}} Stephen {{as the new}} king. He immediately restored his mother's royal honours and had his stepmother imprisoned. Stephen's first act as king was to notify Ragusa of his election and claim tributes now due to him. An Ottoman raid enabled the Ragusans to stall the <b>payement.</b> Stephen took into his service Miho Kaboga (of the Ragusan Kaboga family), a former protovestijar of Grand Duke Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, and soon fell under his influence, which the nobility resented. Kaboga urged him to conquer the Ragusan city of Ston, claiming it was not strongly fortified and that the peninsula of Pelješac was not protected. Stephen claimed the Hrvatinić house in Ragusa, {{as well as the}} coast surrounding Slano and all the [...] "royal goods", but eventually relented. After a council with his mother and the nobility in the town of Zvečaj in March 1419, Stephen confirmed the privileges granted to Ragusa by his predecessors. The same year he confirmed the sale of Konavli and the Sokol Fortress of his vassal Sandalj Hranić Kosača to Ragusa.|$|E

Secondly, {{the cause of}} the revolt was not the {{pressure}} of barbarian people in the island (it was not less in the forth century) but a lack of <b>payement</b> to the garrison placed in. This garrison included not only static troops, but also comitatenses. Finally, the third hypotesis refers to Constantinus, the future Constantinus III. He was not an occasional usurper appointed by troops, but an skilled politician who designed his strategy from the beginning: he named Gratian and then he removed him from power in order to take it upon himself...|$|E

The protocol uses electronic cash for payment transactions. In this new protocol, {{from the viewpoint of}} banks, consumers can improve anonymity if they are worried about disclosure of their identities. An agent provides a higher anonymous certificate and improves the security of the consumers. The agent will certify re-encrypted data after verifying the validity of the content from consumers, but with no private information of the consumers required. With this new method, each consumer can get teh required anonymity level, depending on the available time, computation and cost...|$|E
40|$|Discharge {{a rescue}} mode of {{resolution}} of insolvency Summary The {{aim of this}} thesis {{is to provide a}} comprehensive analysis of the Institute of debt relief as one of the solution of bankruptcy. The work is divided into three chapters. The first chapter is a historical excursion, describing the evolution of resolving insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings in the world and in the Czech Republic. The second chapter deals with the general interpretation of the concept of bankruptcy, insolvency proceedings and its effects. The third and most extensive chapter then focuses on discharge from debts itself and its nodal points that are crucial in this process. Namely persons entitled to file a petition for permission to discharge debts, including the requirements of this petition, the court's decision on the permit and subsequent approval of discharge from debts, debt discharge methods and duties of the debtor, and finally the decision of fullfilment of debt discharge and exemption of debtor from debts. Act no. 182 / 2006 Coll. on bankruptcy and its solution (Insolvency Act) provides two methods of debt discharge. Debt discharge through the realisation of assets or under the schedule <b>payement.</b> Both methods have in common that the debtor must pay at least 30 % of the total value of its unsecured debts and the unsecured [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Since late 2003 in Senegal, {{voluntary}} tests, ARVs and CD 4 counts {{have been}} provided free of charge by the State {{within the framework of}} public health services. Debate now focuses on expanding free access to other components of care (consultations, hospitalizations, complementary exams for opportunistic infections). A preliminary study assessed the supplementary cost needed to fund all care and appraised this measure's impact on the national program. Direct costs for treatment were calculated using two different methods: (1) by calculating total expenditures for a sample of 299 patients over a 22 -month period (July 2003 to April 2005) treated by HAART (2 NRTI + 1 PI or NNRTI); and (2) by assessing the theoretical costs necessary to apply the national treatment protocols. Furthermore, national budgetary projections were analyzed to estimate possible margins available to officials. In 2006, the total cost of medical care for someone taking ARVs falls around 412 € per year; 84 % of the cost covers the price of ARVs and reagents for CD 4 counts. The total annual cost of medical care for a PLWHA who does not need ARV drugs is approximately 40 € per year, with 90 % of this amount covering biological exams. Projections concerning changes in the number of PLWHA and treatment needs and analysis of budget estimations for 2007 - 2011 demonstrate that supplementary costs incurred by complete free access could be easily covered without disrupting the proposed funding plan. Complete free access for medical care for all PLWHA in the country is therefore economically feasible; what remains is to define this decision's integration into the current paying health system without causing disturbances that render the decision ineffective.
