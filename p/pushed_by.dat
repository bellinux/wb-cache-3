5|$|Herodotus {{provides}} a dubious account of Darius's ascension: Several days after Gaumata had been assassinated, Darius {{and the other}} six nobles discussed {{the fate of the}} empire. At first, the seven discussed the form of government; a democratic republic was strongly <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> Otanes, an oligarchy was <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> Megabyzus, while Darius pushed for a monarchy. After stating that a republic would lead to corruption and internal fighting, while a monarchy would be led with a single-mindedness not possible in other governments, Darius was able to convince the other nobles.|$|E
5|$|Community {{opposition}} did exist, {{mainly from}} residents of Ahwatukee. While the Maricopa Association of Governments had considered building a limited access parkway or arterials along the South Mountain Freeway's proposed route, the eight-lane freeway concept ultimately was <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> the region's planners {{to meet the}} traffic needs at close to the same cost. For most of 2010, the Gila River Indian Community, Maricopa Association of Governments, City of Phoenix, ADOT and others discussed movement of the alignment to tribal land, but no agreements were reached.|$|E
5|$|Orographic or relief {{snowfall}} {{is caused}} when masses of air <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> wind are forced {{up the side}} of elevated land formations, such as large mountains. The lifting of air {{up the side of}} a mountain or range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier, warmer air on the descending, leeward side. The resulting enhanced productivity of snow fall and the decrease in temperature with elevation means that snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.|$|E

She won the Coast to Coast a record five times (1991–1994, 1996), the national mountain bike series every year until aged 40, and the Karapoti Classic all eight times that she started. In 1994, after being <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> Susan DeMattei through the whole race, Lynch set a new race record at the Karapoti Classic that stood for 13 years. At the 1995 Karapoti Classic, she defeated the world number 2 – Caroline Alexander.|$|E
5|$|According to Armando Maya Castro, many {{students}} {{who are members of}} the church have been discriminated against for refusing to partake in celebrations and customs concerning the Day of the Dead in their schools, and some have been punished for it. In one case reported by a Mexican newspaper, La Gaceta, a female member of the church was <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> a fellow bus passenger, who then crossed herself because the member was wearing a long skirt. In July 25, 2008, a public official sealed the entrance to a La Luz del Mundo temple in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, trapping the congregation inside until other officials removed the seals. This incident occurred because of complaints from individuals who did not like the presence of the church in the area. Reporter Rodolfo Chávez Calderón stated that the church was in compliance with local laws.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Innocent VIII's death, the names of Cardinals Gherardo and Sanseverino (both created in pectore), had not been published, thus making them ineligible to {{participate}} in the conclave; however, both were published as an act of the College in sede vacante, Gherardo having been <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> Giovanni Battista Orsini and Sanseverino by Ascanio Sforza. Gherardo was assigned the title of Santi Nereo e Achilleo, which it was believed Innocent VIII had intended for him; Sanseverino was given the poor and undesirable diaconate of San Teodoro to ensure that the future pontiff would confirm his assignment.|$|E

5|$|British Waterways {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted of trains of barges, which were <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> a tug, and {{which would be}} loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The ship would then transport them across the North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, because {{they believed that the}} system would threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and gravel barges.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{deployed}} his own forces {{along the}} whole length of Maxentius' line. He ordered his cavalry to charge, and they broke Maxentius' cavalry. He then sent his infantry against Maxentius' infantry, pushing many into the Tiber {{where they were}} slaughtered and drowned. The battle was brief: Maxentius' troops were broken before the first charge. Maxentius' horse guards and praetorians initially held their position, but broke under {{the force of a}} Constantinian cavalry charge; they also broke ranks and fled to the river. Maxentius rode with them, and attempted to cross the bridge of boats, but he was <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> the mass of his fleeing soldiers into the Tiber, and drowned.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of the First World War the NUWSS spent its time in north Wales organising educational and propaganda campaigns. In south Wales friction was caused by a shift in political views pushed onto the country from the central office. 1912 saw the NUWSS switch its policy as a non-party organisation to set up the Election Fighting Fund (EFF) to support the newly burgeoning Labour Party. Wales had traditionally been a Liberal heartland and the South Wales Federation of Women’s Suffrage Societies was opposed to this new policy. There was a sense that there was a disjoint between the central 'English feminist agenda' <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> the militant headquarters and the needs of Welsh social, cultural and political views. The strains existed between the two organisation until the EFF was abandoned in 1914.|$|E

5|$|Massachusetts was {{the first}} state in North America to require {{municipalities}} to appoint a teacher or establish a grammar school {{with the passage of}} the Massachusetts Education Law of 1647, and 19th century reforms <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> Horace Mann laid much of the groundwork for contemporary universal public education which was established in 1852. Massachusetts is home to the oldest school in continuous existence in North America (The Roxbury Latin School, founded in 1645), as well as the country's oldest public elementary school (The Mather School, founded in 1639), its oldest high school (Boston Latin School, founded in 1635), its oldest continuously operating boarding school (The Governor's Academy, founded in 1763), its oldest college (Harvard University, founded in 1636), and its oldest women's college (Mount Holyoke College, founded in 1837).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile Captain Archer, {{accompanied}} by Lieutenant Reed, Ensign Sato, {{and a team}} of MACOs, enters the vortex created by the Xindi weapon. During the pursuit, a recovering Sato is <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> Archer to decipher Degra's schematics. Again Archer is suddenly pulled into the future by Temporal Agent Daniels, this time to the founding of the United Federation of Planets, but Archer is again uninterested. Arriving near Earth, Archer receives an unexpected transmission from Commander Shran, who engages and then destroys the Reptilian ship. In the chaos, Archer and his team are able to beam aboard the weapon. A fierce fire-fight ensues, and as Archer and Sato try to disable the weapon, Commander Dolim attempts to stop them. He fails and the weapon is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|On 5 March 2012, {{prior to}} release, Kolkata Metro {{authorities}} objected to {{a scene in}} which Vidya is <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> a man onto the tracks as a train arrives. They requested that the scene be removed, as it would remind people of the past suicides, which had tarnished the railway's image. The filmmakers screened the scene for the authorities and explained that nothing in the film would affect the image of the Metro or prompt people to commit suicide. Convinced, the officials withdrew their objections, and the scene was retained, although it was removed from trailers.|$|E

5|$|Several {{newspapers}} published {{images of}} Tomlinson's {{first encounter with}} police that evening. According to Barry Smith, Tomlinson left the newspaper stand outside Monument Tube Station at around 7pm. The Daily Mail published an image showing Tomlinson smoking a cigarette {{in front of a}} police van in Lombard Street. An eyewitness, IT worker Ross Hardy, said Tomlinson was drunk and refusing to move; a police van tried to nudge him out of the way, and when that didn't work he was moved by four riot officers. The newspaper published a second image of him apparently being <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> the police. On 16 April The Guardian published three images of Tomlinson taken at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Since the Middle Ages, {{both the}} Stjørdalen and Verdal valleys were {{important}} trade routes connecting Trøndelag and Jämtland. In particular, Levanger grew into an important trading town for Jämtland farmers, who would travel across the Verdal Mountains. The first public {{discussion of a}} railway was launched in Levanger in 1858; the initiative was <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> Jämtland's governor Thome, who proposed a line via Verdal to Levanger. At the time, the Trondhjem–Støren Line {{was about to be}} built, and the commercial interests in Trondheim were more concerned with a southward connection along what would become the Røros Line to Oslo. A 1869 meeting in Sundsvall, Sweden, had proposed three routes for the line: via Verdal, via Meråker or as a branch from Røros.|$|E
5|$|The {{methods used}} to {{cultivate}} crops are described in Book XVIII. He praises Cato the Elder and his work De Agri Cultura, which he uses as a primary source. Pliny's work includes discussion of all known cultivated crops and vegetables, as well as herbs and remedies derived from them. He describes machines used in cultivation and processing the crops. For example, he describes a simple mechanical reaper that cut the ears of wheat and barley without the straw and was <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> oxen (Book XVIII, chapter 72). It is depicted on a bas-relief found at Trier from the later Roman period. He also describes how grain is ground using a pestle, a hand-mill, or a mill driven by water wheels, as found in Roman water mills across the Empire.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene with}} Peter in the hypnotherapist's office was censored from television, as Peter {{discusses}} his genitals and reproductive organs. When Peter {{comes to the}} realization that Francis is not his real father and when Stewie dreams about being tortured by Lois, a harp sound can be heard; MacFarlane comments that even small things like that take {{a lot of work to}} produce. The alcohol bottles being <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> the airplane that Peter and Brian are traveling on were animated by computer, as is the taxi driving along the street. On the DVD commentary, MacFarlane notes that the scene would not have looked good without computer aid. He said it makes the animations seem more realistic than without a computer. The two men circling each other for fifty years and waiting for the other to throw the first punch was not broadcast for television.|$|E
5|$|Caligari {{was filmed}} in the Lixie-Atelier film studio (formerly owned by Continental-Kunstfilm) at 9 Franz Joseph-Strasse (now Max Liebermannstraße), Weißensee, a {{north-eastern}} suburb of Berlin. Decla {{had been making}} films at the Lixie studio since October 1919, having previously released three titles, Die Pest in Florenz (1919) and the two parts of Fritz Lang's The Spiders (Die Spinnen). The relatively small size of the studio (built some five years earlier in 1914) meant most of the sets used in the film do not exceed six meters in width and depth. Certain elements from the original script had to be cut from the film due to the limited space, including a procession of gypsies, a handcart <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> Dr. Caligari, Jane's carriage, and a chase scene involving horse-cabs. Likewise, the script called for a fairground scene with roundabouts, barrel organs, sideshow barkers, performers and menageries, none {{of which could be}} achieved in the restrictive space. Instead, the scenes use a painting of the Holstenwall town as a background; throngs of people walk around two spinning merry-go-round props, which creates the impression of a carnival. The script also made references to modern elements like telephones, telegrams and electric light, but they were eliminated during the filming, leaving the final film's setting with no indication of a specific time period.|$|E
5|$|Manstein's first {{attack on}} Sevastopol in November failed, and with {{insufficient}} forces left {{for an immediate}} assault, he ordered an investment of the heavily fortified city. By 17 December he launched another offensive, which also failed. On 26 December the Soviet troops landed on the Kerch Straits to retake Kerch and its peninsula, and on 30 December executed another landing near Feodosiya. Only a hurried withdrawal from the area, in contravention of Manstein's orders, by the 46th Infantry Division under General Hans Graf von Sponeck prevented a collapse of {{the eastern part of}} the Crimea; the division lost most of its heavy equipment. Manstein cancelled a planned resumption of the attack and sent most of his forces east to destroy the Soviet bridgehead. The Soviet forces were in a superior position regarding men and materiel as they were able to re-supply by sea, and were therefore <b>pushed</b> <b>by</b> Stalin to conduct further offensives. However, the Soviet troops were unable to capture the critical rail and road access points which would have cut the German lines of supply.|$|E
