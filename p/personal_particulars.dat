But, {{whatever}} {{the manner of}} sin, by offense or defect, which the preacher fears in his people, surely he has of late been wholly remiss in compelling their definite recognition of it, in its several and <b>personal</b> <b>particulars.</b> Nothing in the various inconsistency of human nature is more grotesque than its willingness to be taxed with any quantity of sins in the gross, and its resentment at the insinuation of having committed the smallest parcel of them in detail. And the English Liturgy, evidently drawn up with the amiable intention of making religion as pleasant as possible, to a people desirous of saving their souls with no great degree of personal inconvenience, is perhaps in no point more unwholesomely lenient than in its concession to the popular conviction that we may obtain the present advantage, and escape the future punishment, of any sort of iniquity, by dexterously concealing the manner of it from man, and triumphantly confessing the quantity of it to God.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps the {{postmistress}} was belled; {{but if she}} did not [...] "steam" [...] {{the letters}} and confide their titbits to favoured friends of her own sex, {{it is difficult to see}} how all the gossip got out. The schoolmaster once played an unmanly trick on her, with the view of catching her in the act. He was a bachelor who had long been given up by all the maids in the town. One day, however, he wrote a letter to an imaginary lady in the county-town, asking her to be his, and going into full particulars about his income, his age, and his prospects. A male friend in the secret, at the other end, was to reply, in a lady's handwriting, accepting him, and also giving <b>personal</b> <b>particulars.</b> The first letter was written; and an answer arrived in due course--two days, the schoolmaster said, after date. No other person knew of this scheme for the undoing of the postmistress, yet in a very short time the schoolmaster's coming marriage was the talk of Thrums. Everybody became suddenly aware of the lady's name, of her abode, and of the sum of money she was to bring her husband. It was even noised abroad that the schoolmaster had represented his age as a good ten years less than it was. Then the schoolmaster divulged everything. To his mortification, he was not quite believed. All the proof he could bring forward to support his story was this: that time would show whether he got married or not. Foolish man! this argument was met by another, which was accepted at once. The lady had jilted the schoolmaster. Whether this explanation came from the post-office, who shall say? But so long as he lived the schoolmaster was twitted about the lady who threw him over. He took his revenge in two ways. He wrote and posted letters exceedingly abusive of the postmistress. The matter might be libellous; but then, as he pointed out, she would incriminate herself if she [...] "brought him up" [...] about it. Probably Lizzie felt his other insult more. By publishing his suspicions of her on every possible occasion he got a few people to seal their letters. So bitter was his feeling against her that he was even willing to supply the wax.|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{of this study}} focused {{on the ability of}} provincial government departments in South Africa to spend allocated revenues on activities adequately, with a direct bearing on social and economic development. The research presents an analysis of two selected Eastern Cape Provincial Government departments’ expenditure for a three-year timeframe (the fiscal years from 2009 – 2012), with a focus on the oversight role played by the Provincial Planning and Treasury department in instilling fiscal discipline in the provinces, and the potentially detrimental effect of under-spending on provincial service delivery. Among other things mentioned and discussed are, firstly, the fiscal policy; secondly, the funding of provincial departments; thirdly, the role and responsibilities of the Provincial Planning and Treasury department. The study adopted a qualitative methodology which focussed on the perspective of the insider who has experienced first-hand the activities or procedures under scrutiny in the selected provincial departments.
