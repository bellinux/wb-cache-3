5|$|The hurst {{of trees}} with a {{representation}} of the Pole Star above are a <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> name Northwood. The mitre and fleurs-de-lys refer to the Abbey of Bec Herlewin in Normandy, to whom the Lordship of Ruislip was granted, where there was a cell of the Order. The Manor was later seized by Henry V and granted as part of the endowment of King's College, Cambridge. The Abbey and the College were dedicated to St. Mary, one of whose symbols is a fleur-de-lis. The 'rye slips' are a <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> name Ruislip. The wild boar shows that the Lordship was an ancient one, granted when the land was forest roamed by wild boars.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the works}} created {{during the war}} was Yakov Knyazhnin's tragedy Olga (1772). The Russian playwright chose to {{introduce}} Sviatoslav as his protagonist, although his active participation in the events following Igor's death is {{out of sync with}} the traditional chronology. Knyazhnin's rival Nikolai Nikolev (1758â€“1815) also wrote a <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject of Sviatoslav's life. Ivan Akimov's painting Sviatoslav's Return from the Danube to Kiev (1773) explores the conflict between military honour and family attachment. It is a vivid example of Poussinesque rendering of early medieval subject matter.|$|E

5|$|Beauty Revealed was {{completed}} {{during a period}} of popularity of portrait miniatures, a medium which had been introduced in the United States in the late 18th century. By the time Goodridge completed her self-portrait, miniatures were increasing in complexity and vibrance. The Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History describes Beauty Revealed as a <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eye miniatures which were then popular as tokens of affection in England and France, but not common in the US. Such miniatures allowed portraits of loved ones to be carried by their suitors without revealing the sitters' identities.|$|E

The program was never officially released nor cancelled, though the trademarks for both Myosphere and Mya were abandoned by Motorola in 2002. The name Mya was believed to be a <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> words 'My assistant'.|$|E

5|$|During Hunt's injury, Bennett moved Broncos {{teammate}} Justin Hodges to fullback and Hodges {{was impressive}} in the position. When Hunt {{returned to the}} Broncos side in Round 25 against the Parramatta Eels, {{he was forced to}} <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wing due to Hodges' good form. Hunt and Hodges continued to switch the fullback position {{for the remainder of the}} season.

The Tune of Echoes activates Time Portals at fixed locations; the Tune of Currents enables Link to travel from the past to the present without a Time Portal; the Tune of Ages allows Link to switch between the two time periods at almost any location on the map.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of the resting Bradman, Hassett won the toss and elected to bat. Attendance was 17,000 {{on the first day of}} this two-day non-first-class match.

Many of the Australians made starts and six scores passed 20, but none went on. Paceman Keith Jackson took 5/76 for the hosts. Five Australian bowlers each took one wicket and Jackson top-scored with 23 before rain ended the match.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} album credits, Harrison {{was listed as}} producer, writer and arranger but was not included among the performers, leading to an assumption {{that he did not}} <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> recordings. After consulting Barham in 2002 for his book While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Leng credited Harrison as a performing musician, and Spizer also recognised him in his track-by-track list, published in 2005. The performer credits in the 2014 reissue of Wonderwall Music rectified the situation, and list Harrison on piano and guitar.|$|E
