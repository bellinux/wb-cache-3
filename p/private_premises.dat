25|$|For {{this reason}} {{the scope of}} implied {{licenses}} is strictly limited in New Zealand. The Supreme Court has said an implied license is unlikely to exist if {{the purpose of the}} entry was not to make a reasonable inquiry or if it cannot be assumed that the occupier would have consented to the police entering had they known the particular purpose for the entry. An implied license can extend to allow entry into a <b>private</b> <b>premises</b> in certain circumstances but this will be in the minority of cases and there will generally be no right of access even where, for example, the door to the premises is open. An implied license can be revoked by the occupier through a clear unequivocal revocation, further, the existence of gates or signs may amount to a physical revocation.|$|E
30|$|We {{evaluated}} our asymmetric partitioning on {{the aforementioned}} DayTrader application (cf. Section  2).

25|$|Although {{there were}} {{attempts}} in the 1580s to establish also Faculties of Law and Medicine, they failed {{due to lack}} of financing. While Canon law was read at the Faculty of Theology since 1667, it was especially the Moravian Nobility, which pursued establishment of secular Professorate of Law in 1679 by a decree of Emperor Leopold I. The first Olomouc professor of law was Karel Ferdinand Irmler. The secular legal studies faced very strong opposition from the Jesuits: initially the professors taught at <b>private</b> <b>premises,</b> while later the lectures were held at the Olomouc Court of Law. Large number of Emperors' interventions was needed to secure continuation of legal studies in following decades. Since 1709 the Olomouc University law professors were appointed directly by the Emperor, in 1714 the Jesuits were forced to accept secular legal lectures within the university grounds. The situation improved after establishment of the Academy of Nobility in 1725 (law professors taught at both the university and academy). In 1732 Olomouc became the first law school in the Habsburg monarchy to teach Fief and Public law at an independent department. Later, in 1755, the lectures were extended to cover also international and natural law. In 1766 the first non-Jesuit University Rector was appointed – the professor of law Johann Heinrich Bösenselle.|$|E

In the majority of cases, the detainees disappeared or were executed." ...|$|E
30|$|In {{future work}} {{we plan to}} support a more loosely coupled service-oriented {{architecture}} for partitioning applications. Our current implementation of data-tier partitioning relies on leveraging the distributed query engine from a production database. In some environments, relying on a homogeneous integration of data by the underlying platform may not be realistic. We are currently working to automatically generate REST interfaces to integrate data between the public cloud and <b>private</b> <b>premise</b> {{rather than relying on}} a SQL layer.|$|R
30|$|For some transactions, lock {{contention}} is negligible. This {{is because the}} application semantics don’t induce sharing of table rows between multiple user sessions. For example, in DayTrader, although Account and Holdings tables are involved in an atomic transaction, specific rows of these tables are only ever accessed by a single user concurrently. In such cases we charge the cost of two extra round-trips between the cloud and the <b>private</b> <b>premise</b> to the objective function, one to prepare the remote site for the transaction and another to commit it.|$|R

2500|$|Generally police {{officers}} must have statutory {{authorisation to enter}} on to private property. Police entry on to property outside of statutory powers may be lawful and reasonable where an implied license exists. An implied license permits an officer to “go {{to the door of}} <b>private</b> <b>premises</b> in order to make inquiry of an occupier for any reasonable purpose”. This is significant as a police officer may find evidence of an offence while on the property under the implied license. Finding this evidence will not be an unlawful search as a result of trespass as the officer is lawfully on the property, this was the scenario in Tararo v R (2010) ...|$|E

30|$|While {{there are}} {{advantages}} to deploying Web applications on public cloud infrastructure, many companies wish to retain control over specific resources [1] by keeping {{them at a}} <b>private</b> <b>premise.</b> As a result, hybrid cloud computing has become a popular architecture where systems are built {{to take advantage of}} both public and private infrastructure to meet different requirements. However, architecting an efficient distributed system across these locations requires significant effort. An effective partitioning should not only guarantee that privacy constraints and performance objectives are met, but also should deliver on one of the primary reasons for using the public cloud, a cheaper deployment.|$|R
30|$|Third, some {{application}} requests execute {{more than}} one query. In these cases, it may be beneficial to partition functions to group execution with data at a single location. Such grouping helps to eliminate latency overhead otherwise needed to move data to the location where the application-tier code executes. An {{example of this is}} shown in Figure  2 (b), where a sub-tree of function executions for TradeJdbc:login is labeled as “private” (gray nodes). By pushing this sub-tree to the <b>private</b> <b>premise,</b> the computation needed for working over account and accountprofile data in the two queries under TradeJdbc:login can be completed at the premise without multiple round-trips between locations.|$|R
30|$|Building on {{our initial}} work on {{asymmetric}} code partitioning, we {{have addressed the}} challenges of cross-tier code and data partitioning by developing a generalized framework that analyzes both code and data usage in a web application, and then converts the data into a BIP problem. The BIP is fed to an off-the-shelf optimizer whose output yields suggestions for placement of application- and data-tier components to either public cloud or <b>private</b> <b>premise.</b> Using proper tooling and middleware, a new system can now be distributed across the hybrid architecture using the optimized placement suggestions. We provide the first approach for partitioning which integrates models of both application-tier and data-tier execution.|$|R

30|$|For {{computing}} monetary {{costs of}} deployments, we use parameters {{taken from the}} advertised Amazon EC 2 service where {{the cost of an}} extra large EC 2 instance is $ 0.48 /hour and the cost of data transfer is $ 0.12 /GB. To evaluate deployment costs, we apply these machine and data transfer costs to the performance results from Section  6.1, scale the ten minute deployment times to one month, and gradually change the ratio of premise-to-cloud deployment costs to assess the effects of varying cost of <b>private</b> <b>premise</b> on the overall deployment costs. As these input parameters are changed, we re-run the new inputs through our tool, deploy the generated source code partitions from the tool as separate Java “war” archives, and run each experiment.|$|R
30|$|Creating the {{optimization}} {{objective function}} {{consists of two}} parts: (i) determining {{the costs associated with}} the execution of individual operators, and (ii) creating a mathematical formulation of those costs. The magnitude of the execution cost for each operator and the communication cost between operators that are split across the network are computed using a similar cost model to previous work [12]. This accounts for the variation between local execution and distributed execution in that the latter will make use of a semi-join optimization to reduce costs (i.e. input data to a distributed join operator will transmit only the columns needed to collect matching rows). We extend the previous cost model to account for possible transaction delays. We assume that if the tables involved in an atomic transaction are split across the cloud and the <b>private</b> <b>premise,</b> by default the transaction will be resolved using the two-phase commit protocol.|$|R

And, although, in reality, [...] "X-Mas Half-nude Party" [...] is but the title of the band's third song, the moral fuss which had developed around the concert prompted the Wan Chai Police to intervene (on the grounds that it is illegal to host a public function in a <b>private</b> <b>premise</b> !) and the show was eventually cancelled.

30|$|First, as {{described}} in Section  2, placing more of the less-sensitive data in the cloud will allow for the corresponding code from the application-tier to also {{be placed in the}} cloud, thus increasing the overall efficiency of the deployment and reducing data transfer. However, this can result in splitting the set of tables used in a query across public and private locations. For our DayTrader example, each user can have many stocks in her holding which makes the holding table quite large. As shown in Figure  2, splitting the join operation can push the holdings table to the cloud (square nodes) and eliminate the traffic of moving its data to the cloud. This splitting also maintains our constraint to have the privacy sensitive account table on the <b>private</b> <b>premise.</b> An effective modeling of the data-tier needs to help the BIP optimizer reason about the trade-offs of distributing such queries across the hybrid architecture.|$|R

40|$|Part 2 : Cloud ComputingInternational audienceHybrid cloud {{deployment}} offers {{flexibility in}} trade-offs between the cost-savings/scalability {{of the public}} cloud and control over data resources provided at a <b>private</b> <b>premise.</b> However, this flexibility comes {{at the expense of}} complexity in distributing a system over these two locations. For multi-tier web applications, this challenge manifests itself primarily in the partitioning of application- and database-tiers. While there is existing research that focuses on either application-tier or data-tier partitioning, we show that optimized partitioning of web applications benefits from both tiers being considered simultaneously. We present our research on a new cross-tier partitioning approach to help developers make effective trade-offs between performance and cost in a hybrid cloud deployment. In two case studies the approach results in up to 54 % reduction in monetary costs compared to a premise only deployment and 56 % improvement in execution time compared to a naïve partitioning where application-tier is deployed in the cloud and data-tier is on private infrastructure...|$|R

30|$|From {{the results}} of these experiments, we saw the {{significant}} effect that asymmetric partitioning had in enabling more code to be pushed to the cloud by the optimizer. This is because costs of data transfer to the code running on the public cloud are less expensive than data coming from the public cloud. However, while closely examining the resulting partitioning in our visualization we noticed a common case where some code was rarely ever pushed to the public cloud, making automated partitioning less effective. This case always occurred for code which was tightly coupled to some persistent data which we assumed was always stored on premise. This phenomenon is illustrated well by the function nodes in Figure  2 (a) which are rooted at the function TradeJdbc:getHoldings. Based on this observation we were motivated to investigate the potential of extending our approach to scenarios where persistent data could be distributed across both the public cloud and <b>private</b> <b>premise.</b> Next in Section  5, we augment the asymmetric code partitioning approach with this cross-tier, code and data partitioning.|$|R
