40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} recent {{interest in the}} cog-nitive style of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). One theory, that of weak central coherence, concerns an inability to combine stimulus details into a coherent whole. Here we test this theory {{in the case of}} sound patterns, using a new de®nition of the details (local structure) and the coherent whole (glo-bal structure). Thirteen individuals with a diagnosis of autism or Asperger's syndrome and 15 control partici-pants were administered auditory tests, where they were required to match local <b>pitch</b> direction <b>changes</b> between two auditory sequences. When the other local features of the sequence pairs were altered (the actual pitches and relative time points of <b>pitch</b> direction <b>change),</b> the <b>control</b> participants obtained lower scores compared with when these details were left unchanged. This can be attributed to interference from the global structure, de®ned as the combination of the local audi-tory details. In contrast, the participants with ASD did not obtain lower scores in the presence of such mis-matches. This was attributed to the absence of interfer-ence from an auditory coherent whole. The results are consistent with the presence of abnormal interactions between local and global auditory perception in ASD...|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{subjective}} tinnitus {{is characterized}} by abnormal neuronal synchronization in the central auditory system. As shown in a controlled clinical trial, acoustic coordinated reset (CR) neuromodulation causes a significant relief of tinnitus symptoms along with a significant decrease of pathological oscillatory activity in a network comprising auditory and non-auditory brain areas, which is often accompanied with a significant tinnitus <b>pitch</b> <b>change.</b> Here we studied if the tinnitus <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> correlates with a reduction of tinnitus loudness and/or annoyance as assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) scores. Furthermore, we studied if the changes of the pattern of brain synchrony in tinnitus patients induced by 12 weeks of CR therapy depend {{on whether or not}} the patients undergo a pronounced tinnitus <b>pitch</b> <b>change.</b> Therefore, we applied standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) to EEG recordings from two groups of patients with a sustained CR-induced relief of tinnitus symptoms with and without tinnitus <b>pitch</b> <b>change.</b> We found that absolute changes of VAS loudness and VAS annoyance scores significantly correlate with the modulus, i. e., the absolute value, of the tinnitus <b>pitch</b> <b>change.</b> Moreover, as opposed to patients with small or no <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> we found a significantly stronger decrease in gamma power in patients with pronounced tinnitus <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> in right parietal cortex (Brodmann area, BA 40), right frontal cortex (BA 9, 46), left temporal cortex (BA 22, 42), and left frontal cortex (BA 4, 6), combined with a significantly stronger increase of alpha (10 - 12 Hz) activity in the right and left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; BA 32, 24). In addition, we revealed a significantly lower functional connectivity in the gamma band between the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 46) and the right ACC (BA 32) after 12 weeks of CR therapy in patients with pronounced <b>pitch</b> <b>change.</b> Our results indicate a substantial, CR-induced reduction of tinnitus-related auditory binding in a pitch processing network...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This study aims to {{identify}} the neural substrate involved in prosodic pitch processing. Functional magnetic resonance imaging {{was used to test}} the premise that prosody pitch processing is primarily subserved by the right cortical hemisphere. Two experimental paradigms were used, firstly pairs of spoken sentences, where the only variation was a single internal phrase <b>pitch</b> <b>change,</b> and secondly, a matched condition utilizing <b>pitch</b> <b>changes</b> within analogous tone-sequence phrases. This removed the potential confounder of lexical evaluation. fMRI images were obtained using these paradigms. Results Activation was significantly greater within the right frontal and temporal cortices during the tone-sequence stimuli relative to the sentence stimuli. Conclusion This study showed that <b>pitch</b> <b>changes,</b> stripped of lexical information, are mainly processed by the right cerebral hemisphere, whilst the processing of analogous, matched, lexical <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> is preferentially left sided. These findings, showing hemispherical differentiation of processing based on stimulus complexity, are in accord with a 'task dependent' hypothesis of pitch processing. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{complex tone}} {{composed}} of only higher-order harmonics typically elicits a pitch percept {{equivalent to the}} tone's missing fundamental frequency (f 0). When judging the direction of residue <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> between two such tones, however, listeners may have completely opposite perceptual experiences depending on whether they are biased to perceive changes based on the overall spectrum or the missing f 0 (harmonic spacing). Individual differences in residue <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> judgments are reliable and {{have been associated with}} musical experience and functional neuroanatomy. Tone languages put greater pitch processing demands on their speakers than non-tone languages, and we investigated whether these lifelong differences in linguistic pitch processing affect listeners' bias for residue pitch. We asked native tone language speakers and native English speakers to perform a pitch judgment task for two tones with missing fundamental frequencies. Given tone pairs with ambiguous <b>pitch</b> <b>changes,</b> listeners were asked to judge the direction of <b>pitch</b> <b>change,</b> where the direction of their response indicated whether they attended to the overall spectrum (exhibiting a spectral bias) or the missing f 0 (exhibiting a fundamental bias). We found that tone language speakers are significantly more likely to perceive <b>pitch</b> <b>changes</b> based on the missing f 0 than English speakers. These results suggest that tone-language speakers' privileged experience with linguistic pitch fundamentally tunes their basic auditory processing...|$|R

40|$|This paper focuses {{specifically}} on {{the control of the}} propeller <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> mechanisms and their associated dynamics. The subject of this article is restricted to the mechanisms using a hydraulic single acting actuator. They function asymmetrically and are subject to important varying external loads under the full flight envelope. This phenomenon has an impact on their dynamic response. The question of the dynamics of these systems is rarely dealt with because, usually for aircraft applications, there is no real requirement for propeller pitch dynamic control. But, in the case of some applications, such as the Eurocopter X 3, this dynamic control aspect and the safety aspect of the propeller <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> mechanism are particularly important, because this mechanism is fully involved in aircraft safety, control and handling qualities. Firstly, this paper gives an explanation of the phenomena applied to the propeller <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> mechanism and their contributions to its dynamic response. Then, a model of the dynamic response is proposed. Finally, an experimental identification of the <b>pitch</b> <b>change</b> mechanism dynamics concludes this article.

Adaptive-tracking procedures established separate thresholds for both of these abilities in musically untrained participants across nine age-groups (5 -, 6 -, 7 -, 8 -, 9 -, 10 -, 11 -, 13 -year-olds, and adults). The use of an odd-one-out paradigm avoided the need for participants to use semantic labels when determining the direction of a <b>pitch</b> <b>change,</b> and screening of the adaptive-staircase profile plots permitted the exclusion of inattentive performers. Although adults achieved equivalent thresholds for pitch-change detection and pitch-direction discrimination, there were age-related improvements for pitch-direction discrimination but not pitch-change detection in {{children between the ages of}} 6 and 11 years.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to further investigate differences between musicians and non-musicians in processing <b>pitch</b> <b>changes</b> in spoken sentences. To study the effects of familiarity of intonational contour and of the presence of meaningful context, behavioral and electrophysiological data from Italian musicians and non-musicians were compared in a pitch incongruity detection task using sentences in the native (Italian) and foreign (French) language and in jabberwocky (meaningless sentences formed by pseudowords). Moreover, to examine whether these differences depend on enhanced auditory sensitivity to pitch, the frequency discrimination threshold (FDT) for tones was obtained using a psychophysical procedure. Musicians were more accurate than non-musicians in detecting small <b>pitch</b> <b>changes</b> in all languages showing a smaller response bias, as well as much lower FDTs than non-musicians. The ERP data revealed shorter latencies of a late positivity over parietal sites in musicians than in non-musicians for weak and strong incongruities. Overall results confirmed musicians' advantage in detection of subtle <b>pitch</b> <b>changes</b> not only with tones but also with speech sentences in both native and unfamiliar languages.
