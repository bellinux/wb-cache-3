6000|$|Some of {{the most}} curious {{examples}} of minute imitation are afforded by the caterpillars of the geometer moths, which are always brown or reddish, and resemble in form little twigs of the plant on which they feed. They have the habit, when at rest, of standing out obliquely from the branch, to which they hold on by their hind pair of prolegs or claspers, and remain motionless for hours. Speaking of these protective resemblances Mr. Jenner Weir says: [...] "After being thirty years an entomologist I was deceived myself, and took out my <b>pruning</b> <b>scissors</b> to cut from a plum tree a spur which I thought I had overlooked. This {{turned out to be}} the larva of a geometer two inches long. I showed it to several members of my family, and defined a space of four inches in which it was to be seen, but none of them could perceive that it was a caterpillar."[72] ...|$|E

40|$|In some Hispanic Celtic cemeteries {{there are}} grave good with {{elements}} of daily life. Pieces related with home and productive and / or economic activities. They are {{objects in the}} tombs associated with weapons and / or items of clothing together into packages that accompanied the deceased to the afterlife. Among those related to home we include trivets, grills or barbecues, whose presence in funerary objects is interpreted in relation with the celebration of funeral feasts. They are elements still sporadic appearance in the Celtiberian territory. They are also documented tools to agricultural, livestock and craft economic activities, in Celtiberian areas. Their presence is also poor, but offers a varied repertoire, including sickles, <b>pruning</b> knives, axes, <b>scissors</b> and awls or punches. In this paper, its presence and spatial distribution within some Celtiberian necropolis is analyzed {{to see if it}} is possible to determine whether these objects in the graves provide information on the life and spirituality of the deceased. To do this, and as a test, is part of the known data from a selection of Celtiberian cementerian published floorplans of graves: Las Madrigueras, Riba de Saelices, La Yunta, El Altillo de Cerropozo of Atienza, La Mercadera and Numancia. </p...|$|R
40|$|Work-related {{overload}} syndromes are chiefly {{associated with}} the upper limbs, where carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) plays a leading role. This article analyses methods of diagnosing CTS, with special emphasis on those {{that can be used}} by physicians in early diagnosis of CTS in workers doing monotonous work. It also discusses occupational (e. g., assembly work, typing, playing instruments, packaging and work {{associated with the}} use of a hammer or <b>pruning</b> <b>scissors)</b> and extra-occupational factors (e. g., post-traumatic deformation of bone elements of the carpal tunnel, degenerative and inflammatory changes in tendon sheaths, connective tissue hypertrophy or formation of crystal deposits) leading to CTS; diagnostic methods (subjective symptoms, physical examination, manual provocative tests, vibration perception threshold, electrophysiological examination and imaging methods); and therapeutic and preventive management tools accessible in occupational medicine practice. carpal tunnel syndrome diagnostic methods occupational medicin...|$|E
30|$|Hazelnut {{orchards}} in Terme {{district of}} Samsun province, Turkey, were surveyed to collect hazelnut branches infested with A. dispar and X. germanus during March–April 2017. The infested branches were cut into 30 -cm-long pieces, kept in plastic boxes (20 [*]×[*] 25 [*]×[*] 40  cm), and directly {{transferred to the}} laboratory (Ondokuz Mayıs University, Agriculture Faculty, Plant Protection Department, Samsun, Turkey). The branches were dissected by <b>pruning</b> <b>scissors.</b> Only females were collected from the galleries and inspected under Leica EZ 4 stereomicroscope at ×[*] 40 – 70 magnification to separate healthy adults of A. dispar and X. germanus for use in bioassays. As in many EPF studies (Castrillo et al. 2015), only females {{were used in the}} present study. The males are rare in the population of ambrosia beetles (about 10 : 1 in favor of female), flightless, and rarely seen outside the gallery (Ranger et al. 2016).|$|E
