25|$|The Pollard script, {{also known}} as Pollard Miao is an abugida invented by Methodist missionary Samuel Pollard.

25|$|Therefore, in any {{geometric}} <b>problem</b> <b>we</b> have {{an initial}} set of symbols (points and lines), an algorithm, and some results. From this perspective, geometry {{is equivalent to}} an axiomatic algebra, replacing its elements by symbols. Probably Gauss first realized this, {{and used it to}} prove the impossibility of some constructions; only much later did Hilbert find a complete set of axioms for geometry.|$|E
25|$|Calculus is used {{in every}} branch of the {{physical}} sciences, actuarial science, computer science, statistics, engineering, economics, business, medicine, demography, and in other fields wherever a problem can be mathematically modeled and an optimal solution is desired.

We briefly survey {{some of the}} {{classical}} methods for the numerical so-lution of eigenvalue problems, including methods for large scale <b>problems.</b> <b>We</b> also briefly discuss some of the basics of linear control theory, including stabilization and optimal control and show how they lead to several types of eigenvalue <b>problems.</b> <b>We</b> then discuss how these problems from control theory can be solved via classi-cal and also nonclassical eigenvalue methods. The latter include recently developed structure preserving methods for the solution of Hamiltonian eigenvalue <b>problems.</b> <b>We</b> also demonstrate how structured eigenvalue methods can be developed for large scale and polynomial eigenvalue problems. ...|$|R

25|$|Unger's {{critique}} of and alternative to social programs {{goes to the}} heart of civil society. The <b>problem</b> <b>we</b> are faced with now, he claims, is that we have a bureaucratic system of distribution that provides lower quality service and prohibits the involvement of civil society in the provision of public services. The alternative he lays out is to have the state act to equip civil society to partake in public services and care. This would entail empowering each individual to have two responsibilities, one in the productive economy and one in the caring economy.|$|E
25|$|In {{his later}} years, however, Rockwell began {{receiving}} more attention {{as a painter}} when he chose more serious subjects such as the series on racism for Look magazine. One example of this more serious work is The <b>Problem</b> <b>We</b> All Live With, which dealt {{with the issue of}} school racial integration. The painting depicts a young black girl, Ruby Bridges, flanked by white federal marshals, walking to school past a wall defaced by racist graffiti. This painting was displayed in the White House when Bridges met with President Obama in 2011.|$|E

[...] Rockwell had ended {{his contract with}} the Saturday Evening Post the previous year due to frustration with the limits the magazine placed on his expression of political themes, and Look offered him a forum for his social interests, including civil rights and racial integration. Rockwell explored similar themes in Southern Justice (Murder in Mississippi) and New Kids in the Neighborhood; unlike his previous works for the Post, The <b>Problem</b> <b>We</b> All Live With and these others place black people as sole protagonists, instead of as observers, part of group scenes, or in servile roles. Like New Kids in the Neighborhood, The <b>Problem</b> <b>We</b> All Live With depicts a black child protagonist; like Southern Justice, it uses strong light-dark contrasts to further its racial theme.|$|E
