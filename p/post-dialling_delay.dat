50|$|The {{exchange}} used reed relays as the switching medium, and {{the reeds}} themselves were approximately 3 {{inches in length}} and the only ones available. They were provided by Hivac (then the only UK manufacturer of reed inserts), which was an AT&E subsidiary. TXE2 exchanges would later on use reeds that were half this length. It had multi-stage switching divided into A, B and C switches, and there were devices called links to connect the paths together. A typical local call would go ABC Link CBA. There were two types of links: ones with transmission bridges for local calls and others with no bridges for the outgoing junction calls. The bridges for the latter were contained within the outgoing junction units. The exchange had some advanced features for the time, e.g. multi-frequency (MF) tone dialling was an option as opposed to pulse dialling, with no <b>post-dialling</b> <b>delay</b> for own exchange calls. It also {{had the ability to}} detect a switching failure and go for a repeat attempt without the subscriber being aware of it. Any repeat attempts were printed on a standard teleprinter, which can be seen to the right in the Test Console picture. It had a futuristic test console, which monitored all the calls on a digital display. The display was constructed of ten layers of Perspex, one for each digit and holes drilled in each layer to represent the digit e.g. 9 and each Perspex layer had a bulb mounted above it which was lit when that digit was required. The light then shone through the drilled holes to display the digit.|$|E
50|$|But {{this was}} the GPO, and nothing was ever that simple. Even though all the design {{research}} had already been done by the major US companies, The GPO {{decided to do it}} all over again. Although, initially, they decided to modify the existing 700-type instruments, what hadn't been decided was how the push-buttons should best be laid out. Completely ignoring the then-standard US layout, an experiment was put into motion at the Dollis Hill Research Centre. Mock-ups were made of every conceivable combination and layout of buttons. Each of these had its own seated operator and digital readout. All the button pads and readouts were cabled to a primitive computer. For weeks on end the computer flashed random series of numbers to the digital readouts and the operators had the task of punching these numbers, as quickly as possible, onto the keypads. The speed and accuracy rate were continuously logged, as was the ergonomic comfort of the operators. At the end of many months, much expense, and to absolutely no-one's surprise, the results came out in favour of the existing American layout! Sadly this was too late for at least one major company. ICI had decided to press ahead unilaterally with their own design, the Tele 726, which had two rows of five buttons (no # or * buttons then) set horizontally across the centre of a circular face-plate. This proved very awkward to use. This was the outcome of the trials. A perfectly normal Tele. 746, but fitted with push buttons instead of a dial and re-dubbed 756. The push buttons just created the same loop disconnect signalling pulses as a dial telephone, which caused horrendous <b>post-dialling</b> <b>delay</b> and much knuckle rapping frustration. The model shown in the photograph is actually an 8756, which has been modified to enable it to be used with the 'New Plan' plug and socket system.|$|E
50|$|The {{quality of}} voice {{transmission}} {{is characterized by}} several metrics that may be monitored by network elements, by the user agent hardware or software. Such metrics include network packet loss, packet jitter, packet latency (<b>delay),</b> <b>post-dial</b> <b>delay,</b> and echo. The metrics are determined by VoIP performance testing and monitoring.|$|R
50|$|Quality {{is usually}} {{measured}} by the Answer-Seizure Ratio (ASR = call attempts answered / call attempts), <b>Post-Dial</b> <b>Delay</b> (PDD) and the Average Call Duration (ACD). If the average call duration is very low, it is taken to mean that the call quality is so poor that people cannot have a conversation and hang up. This matters to calling card operators because people do not re-purchase card services that give a low ACD. In case of significant discrepancies in ACD values across available routes, the carrier shall prioritize the routes offering higher ACD. A low ASR is taken to mean that callers cannot get through {{to the other end}} and hence that the route is congested or is of low quality. The low ASR is not as bad as low ACD, because it suggests at least a proper answer supervision (i.e. correct signaling), and therefore the handover mechanism can reroute calls via other available routes. An on-line monitoring system of a quality based routing is publicly available for a demo traffic. <b>Post-dial</b> <b>delay</b> is the time from dialing the last digit to the time a caller hears ringing.|$|R
