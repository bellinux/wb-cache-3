50|$|In the 1950s, Chapanis {{worked with}} Bell Labs {{on the design}} of <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone</b> handsets, {{conducting}} experiments that led to the present layout of the keys.|$|E
50|$|Electronics within <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones</b> {{may provide}} several {{usability}} features, such as last number redial and storage of commonly called numbers. Some telephone models support additional features, such as {{retrieval of information}} and data or code and PIN entry.|$|R
50|$|Obihai {{is notable}} {{primarily}} for manufacturing analog telephone adapters that connect standard <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones</b> to the Google Voice service using a wired or wireless broadband Internet connection. As Google's voice over IP service is inexpensive (and, in some cases, free), hardware {{that allows the}} service to replace conventional landline telephony reduces costs to subscribers.|$|R
50|$|On the side, {{he formed}} his own {{technology}} consulting and design company (Metroprocessing Corporation of America) {{to explore and}} exploit the emerging technology of touch-tone dialing (now used for <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones).</b> His goal was to make Metroprocessing the single source {{of information on the}} application of the twelve button touch tone telephone to private companies and public agencies.|$|R

50|$|As {{telephone}} companies continued to levy surcharges for touch-tone service long after any technical justification ceased to exist, a <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone</b> with pulse dialing capability represented {{a means for}} a user to obtain the convenience of push-button dialing without incurring the touch-tone surcharge.|$|E
50|$|The <b>push-button</b> <b>{{telephone}}</b> is {{a telephone}} that has electronic buttons or keys for dialing a telephone number. This phone was easier and quicker to use than the rotary dial phone because the caller pressed buttons {{rather than having}} to turn a dial.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>push-button</b> {{touch-tone}} <b>telephones</b> {{made their}} debut {{to the general}} public in 1963, the rotary dial telephone still was common for many years. In the 1970s the majority of telephone subscribers still had rotary phones, which in the Bell System of that era were leased from telephone companies instead of being owned outright. Adoption of the push-button phone was steady, but {{it took a long time}} for them to appear in some areas. At first it was primarily businesses that adopted push-button phones. By 1979, the touch-tone phone was gaining popularity, but it wasn't until the 1980s that the majority of customers owned <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones</b> in their homes; by the 1990s, it was the overwhelming majority.|$|R
5000|$|A keypad {{is a set}} {{of buttons}} {{arranged}} in a block or [...] "pad" [...] which bear digits, symbols or alphabetical letters. Pads mostly containing numbers are called a numeric keypad. Numeric keypads are found on alphanumeric keyboards and on other devices which require mainly numeric input such as calculators, <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones,</b> vending machines, ATMs, Point of Sale devices, combination locks, and digital door locks. Many devices follow the E.161 standard for their arrangement.|$|R
5000|$|Dual-tone {{multi-frequency}} signaling (DTMF) is an in-band telecommunication {{signaling system}} using the voice-frequency band over telephone lines between telephone equipment and other communications devices and switching centers. DTMF was first {{developed in the}} Bell System in the United States, and became known under the trademark Touch-Tone for use in <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones</b> supplied to telephone customers, starting in 1963. [...] DTMF is standardized as ITU-T Recommendation Q.23. It is also known in the UK as MF4.|$|R
50|$|OsWALD, {{also known}} as OsWALD Of The Ice Floes, is a 1988 Danish {{computer}} game for Amiga and Commodore 64. The game was designed by Ivan Sølvason {{for use as a}} game controlled over a <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone,</b> for Danish TV2's Friday night prime time program Eleva2ren. The game sold well in Denmark due to the exposure in Eleva2ren.|$|E
50|$|Although DTMF was {{the driving}} {{technology}} implemented in push-button telephones, some telephone manufacturers used push-button keypads to generate pulse dial signaling. Before {{the introduction of}} touch-tone telephone sets, the Bell System sometimes used the term <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone</b> to refer to key system telephones, which were rotary dial telephones that also had a set of push-buttons to select one of multiple telephone circuits, or to activate other features.|$|E
50|$|A {{telephone}} keypad is the keypad {{installed on}} a <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone</b> or similar telecommunication device for dialing a telephone number. It was standardized when the dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) system {{was developed in}} the Bell System in the United States in the 1960s that replaced rotary dialing originally developed in electromechanical switching systems. Because of the installed abundance of rotary dial equipment well into the 1990s, many telephone keypads were also designed to produce loop-disconnect pulses electronically, and some could be optionally switched to produce either DTMF or pulses.|$|E
50|$|Historically, not all <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones</b> used DTMF dialing technology. Some {{manufacturers}} implemented {{pulse dialing}} with push-button keypads and even Western Electric produced several telephone models with a push-button keypad that could also emit traditional dial pulses. Sometimes the mode was user-selectable with a {{switch on the}} <b>telephone.</b> Pulse-mode <b>push-button</b> keypads typically stored the dialed number sequence in a digit collector register to permit rapid dialing for the user. Some push button pulse dial phones allow for double-speed pulse dialing. These allow even faster pulse dialing in exchanges that recognize double-speed pulse dialing.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "push-button" [...] {{has been}} {{utilized}} in calculators, <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones,</b> kitchen appliances, {{and various other}} mechanical and electronic devices, home and commercial.In industrial and commercial applications, push buttons can be connected together by a mechanical linkage so {{that the act of}} pushing one button causes the other button to be released. In this way, a stop button can [...] "force" [...] a start button to be released. This method of linkage is used in simple manual operations in which the machine or process has no electrical circuits for control.|$|R

5000|$|In the UK, a brief {{excursion}} from standards, GPO telecoms {{introduced in}} 1967 their first <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone,</b> the GPO 726 (Ericsson N2000 series [...] ), that used neither pulse dialing nor DTMF tones. It used a DC signalling system comprising {{a number of}} rectifier diodes arranged in different polarity configuration according to the button pressed. The 726 also required an ground wire {{as well as the}} usual A and B wires. The irony was that the dial signal still had to be converted to pulses in the host PABX.|$|E

5000|$|The {{invention}} of the <b>Push-button</b> <b>telephone</b> keypad is attributed to John E. Karlin, an industrial psychologist at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ. On a telephone keypad, the numbers 1 through 9 are arranged from left to right, top to bottom with 0 in a row below 789 and in the center. Telephone keypads also have the special buttons labelled * (star) and # (octothorpe, number sign, [...] "pound", [...] "hex" [...] or [...] "hash") {{on either side of}} the zero key. The keys on a telephone may also bear letters which have had several auxiliary uses, such as remembering area codes or whole telephone numbers.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s, {{telephone}} {{sets were}} developed that combined the bell and induction coil with the desk set, obviating a separate ringer box. The rotary dial becoming commonplace in the 1930s {{in many areas}} enabled customer-dialed service, but some magneto systems remained even into the 1960s. After World-War II, the telephone networks saw rapid expansion and more efficient telephone sets, such as the model 500 telephone in the United States, were developed that permitted larger local networks centered around central offices. A breakthrough new technology was the introduction of Touch-Tone signaling using <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones</b> by American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T) in 1963.|$|R
50|$|It was {{recognized}} {{as early as the}} 1940s that faster, more accurate dialing could be done with push buttons, but this was too unreliable in customer trials until transistors transformed the industry. In 1963, the Bell System introduced to the public its dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) technology under the name Touch-Tone, which was a trademark in the U.S. until 1984. The Touch-Tone system used <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones.</b> In the decades after 1963, pulse dialing was gradually phased out as the primary dialing method to the central office, but many systems still support rotary telephones today. Some keypad telephones have a switch for the selection of tone or pulse dialing.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to 1990 {{while living}} in Moscow, Ivanishvili met Vitaly Malkin, a Russian {{businessman}} currently into politics, with whom he formed a partnership selling computers, and later importing {{what was then a}} novelty in Russia, <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones.</b> The source of his great wealth is metals and banking. Forbes magazine's description of the secret of his success could apply to dozens of other oligarchs in Russia: [...] "He bought firms not needed by anybody for {{tens of millions of dollars}} and sold them for billions of dollars." [...] In 1990 he and Malkin set up [...] "Rossiysky Kredit", which is up to now Ivanishvili's biggest holding. Over the years, he sold other businesses accumulated by him during the privatization era in Russia, investing the proceeds in the Russian stock market. He has also interests in hotels, including Hotel Lux, and in a Russian chain of drugstores called [...] "Doctor Stoletov". He is also redeveloping a former factory in downtown Moscow into a deluxe housing project, the first blocks of which are to be completed by 2012.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{designed}} {{along with}} the panel type telephone office, PCI was intended to allow subscribers in fully automated exchanges to dial numbers in manual offices {{the same way they}} dialed numbers in their own exchange. For PCI to achieve its purpose, the panel office sent the requested number to the manual office, where the number was lit on an operator's display. The switchboard operator at a PCI-aware manual office reads the number from the call indicator display and completes the call in the usual way. As a format of interoffice signaling, PCI is one of multiple options retained for compatibility in the #5 Crossbar switch, a later system which served as the platform for the initial DTMF <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone</b> services.|$|E
50|$|The first fully {{automated}} mobile phone system for vehicles {{was launched in}} Sweden in 1956. Named MTA (Mobiltelefonisystem A), it allowed calls to be made and received in the car using a rotary dial. The car phone could also be paged. Calls from the car were direct dial, whereas incoming calls required an operator to locate the nearest base station to the car. It was developed by Sture Laurén and other engineers at Televerket network operator. Ericsson provided the switchboard while Svenska Radioaktiebolaget (SRA) and Marconi provided the telephones and base station equipment. MTA phones consisted of vacuum tubes and relays, and weighed 40 kg. In 1962, an upgraded version called Mobile System B (MTB) was introduced. This was a <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone,</b> and used transistors and DTMF signaling to improve its operational reliability. In 1971 the MTD version was launched, opening for several different brands of equipment and gaining commercial success. The network remained open until 1983 and still had 600 customers when it closed.|$|E
5000|$|AT&T {{described}} the product as [...] "a method for pushbutton signaling from customer stations using the voice transmission path." [...] In {{order to prevent}} consumer telephones from interfering with the MF-based routing and switching between telephone switching centers, DTMF frequencies differ {{from all of the}} pre-existing MF signaling protocols between switching centers: MF/R1, R2, CCS4, CCS5, and others that were later replaced by SS7 digital signaling. DTMF was known throughout the Bell System by the trademark Touch-Tone. The term was first used by AT&T in commerce on July 5, 1960 and was introduced to the public on November 18, 1963, when the first <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone</b> was made available to the public. It was a registered trademark by AT&T from September 4, 1962 to March 13, 1984. It is standardized by ITU-T Recommendation Q.23. In the UK, it is also known as MF4. In the UK, it is a requirement that the higher frequency tone is 1-4dB Louder than the low frequency tone.|$|E
40|$|Even non-toxophilites (look it up!) {{out there}} {{must realize that}} archery, now a sport for a few, was a {{business}} and a necessary skill for many in days gone by when the yeomen who were bowmen were the military strength of a nation. You can see how many of our ancestors were connected with archery in peace and war when you reflect on the surnames that have come down to us such as Arrowsmith, Fletcher, Bowman, Archer, Stringer and even Abbott (“at the butts”). Here is a peep or little look at the once-big business of archery, once so entrenched in our lives that it not only gave us those surnames (and more) but also a number of words and expressions that remain in use even though few of us today have ever drawn a bow or taken aim at a target. In the same way, expressions such as dial a number and around the clock survive {{in these days of}} <b>push-button</b> <b>telephones</b> and digital watches. Try thinking of some more expressions such as those – and see {{what you can do to}} provide the words taken from archery for the following 20 expressions...|$|R
50|$|The DTMF {{standard}} assigns specific frequencies to each {{column and}} row of <b>push-buttons</b> in the <b>telephone</b> keypad; the columns in the push-button pad have higher-frequency tones, and rows have lower-frequency tones in the audible range. When a button is pressed the dial generates a combination signal {{of the two}} frequencies for the selected row and column, a dual-tone signal, which is transmitted over the phone line to the telephone exchange.|$|R
50|$|The first {{commercial}} {{installation of a}} telephone dial accompanied the {{first commercial}} installation of a 99-line automatic telephone exchange in La Porte, Indiana, in 1892, {{which was based on}} the 1891 Strowger designs. The original dials required complex operational sequences. A workable, albeit error-prone, system was invented by the Automatic Electric Company using three <b>push-buttons</b> on the <b>telephone.</b> These buttons represented the hundreds, tens, and single units of a telephone number. When calling the subscriber number 163, for example, the user had to push the hundreds button once, followed by six presses of the tens button, and three presses of the units button. In 1896, this system was supplanted by an automatic contact-making machine, or calling device. Further development continued during the 1890s and the early 1900s in conjunction with improvements in switching technology.|$|R
50|$|A {{calling party}} wishing {{to speak to}} another party {{will pick up the}} telephone's handset, thereby {{operating}} a lever which closes the switchhook (A4), which powers the telephone by connecting the transmitter (microphone), receiver (speaker), and related audio components to the line. The off-hook circuitry has a low resistance (less than 300 ohms) which causes a direct current (DC), which comes down the line (C) from the telephone exchange. The exchange detects this current, attaches a digit receiver circuit to the line, and sends a dial tone to indicate readiness. On a modern <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone,</b> the caller then presses the number keys to send the telephone number of the called party. The keys control a tone generator circuit (not shown) that makes DTMF tones that the exchange receives. A rotary-dial telephone uses pulse dialing, sending electrical pulses, that the exchange can count to get the telephone number (as of 2010 many exchanges were still equipped to handle pulse dialing). If the called party's line is available, the exchange sends an intermittent ringing signal (about 75 volts alternating current (AC) in North America and UK and 60 volts in Germany) to alert the called party to an incoming call. If the called party's line is in use, the exchange returns a busy signal to the calling party. However, if the called party's line is in use but has call waiting installed, the exchange sends an intermittent audible tone to the called party to indicate an incoming call.|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. The work {{is based}} on a project done by SAMES (South African Micro Electronic Systems) for the local {{production}} of an integrated circuit that previously had to be imported. The circuit finds application in the telecommunications field where it controls loop disconnect dialling in the telephones. The mechanical disc dial is thus replaced by an electronic network that makes use of push-button entry and full digital out-dialling. The <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone</b> is compatible with the rotary disc dial telephone with advantages in reliability, speed and ease of use. An access pause and re dial facility add towards a more efficient telephone. The circuit was bought from an American company for manufacturing purposes. A process fit and circuit modifications were done for product ion on the CMOS process line at SAMES. The work includes a circuit- and process study with modifications, computer aided design, prototype production and analysis.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the basic {{experimental}} results on the mechanical signal generator, which is applicable as the signal source in the <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone</b> set or the end apparatus of data transmission. 　As the signal source of the equipment shown in this paper, the tuning forks are used, and the reed vibrators can be also used. 　The largest problem in the equipment using the mechanical vibrator is {{the rise and fall}} time of signal. The equipment described here has the quick rise time by giving an initial displacement to the mechanical vibrator. 　When the signal generator is set into operation, the magnetic binding force to the vibrator disappears and then the vibrator begins to vibrate in the free damped vibration. The signal generated with the free damped vibration is picked up piezo-electrically or magnetically. 　Two kinds of the construction of the signal generator are described in this paper, one is the electromagnetic drive and piezo-electric pick up type, and the other is the electromagnetic drive and electromagnetic pich up one. 　This equipment has wide application and will be used widely...|$|E
40|$|Memory for {{the layout}} of the ten digits 0 to 9 on the keypads of {{push-button}} telephones and calculators was investigated in five experiments. Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that, despite frequent usage of these devices, free recall of the numerical layouts is quite poor; and that the layout on calculators is even harder to recall than the telephone layout. Experiment 4 showed that {{the same is true for}} recognition of the layouts. Experiment 3 revealed that part of the recall advantage of the telephone layout can be attributed to its being more plausible and more similar to a schematic or prototypical layout of digits. Experiment 5 indicated that a single case of directing attention to the layouts can enhance recall significantly. The results are integrated into earlier research on memory for everyday objects, and concepts used in laboratory memory research such as interference, inference, and attention are used to explain memory for these everyday objects.

40|$|Digital divide {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{relevant}} emergencies of developing countries. The situation is particularly difficult in central Africa, where wide zones are totally disconnected by any kind of communication services. In these areas (sometimes not very far from big towns) many people are living and critical infrastructures, like e. g. hospitals, cannot communicate with the external world. In this work, we are going to propose a feasible and low-cost solution for installing VoIP-based telephone services in peripheral areas not reached by fixed and cellular networking infrastructures. The proposed solution is based on a Wi-Fi radio bridge connecting a remote disconnected site with a gateway placed in a town. The gateway consists only of a PC connected to the PSTN by a suitable interfacing card. The gateway is equipped with the ASTERISK server, a software tool able at routing VoIP calls to a PSTN, as it would happen if a regular <b>push-button</b> <b>telephone</b> was employed. The system was developed and tested in open field and provided very good results in terms of efficiency and reliability. Such a positive testing phase encouraged developers to propose such kind of solution also for practical installation in interested countries. In particular, low hardware costs, easy of use and totally open-source software availability are regarded by potentially interested users as real strength points with respect to other available commercial solutions...|$|E
