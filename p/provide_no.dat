5|$|In {{those who}} are {{otherwise}} healthy, {{there is little evidence}} that supplements have any benefits with respect to cancer or heart disease. Vitamin A and E supplements not only <b>provide</b> <b>no</b> health benefits for generally healthy individuals, but they may increase mortality, though the two large studies that support this conclusion included smokers for whom it was already known that beta-carotene supplements can be harmful. While other findings suggest that vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific form when taken in excess.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses {{are highly}} intelligent, but {{the extent of}} their {{intelligence}} and learning capability are not well defined. Maze and problem-solving experiments have shown evidence of a memory system that can store both short- and long-term memory. It is not known precisely what contribution learning makes to adult octopus behaviour. Young octopuses learn nothing from their parents, as adults <b>provide</b> <b>no</b> parental care beyond tending to their eggs until the young octopuses hatch.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{intended}} to be a proof of concept, BackupHDDVD is severely limited in its ability to produce fully functional copies of commercial discs. Early versions were unable to properly decrypt discs which used the in-movie experience technology. New versions work around this limitation by excluding interactive content from decrypted copies. The utility cannot process HD DVD navigation functionality which enables menus, chapters, secondary audio tracks and subtitles, so these features are inaccessible in copies created by BackupHDDVD. Most versions <b>provide</b> <b>no</b> validation for keys and will still attempt to decrypt a disc's contents with an incorrect key, resulting in corrupt files.|$|E

25|$|Solid radium {{compounds}} {{are white}} as radium ions <b>provide</b> <b>no</b> specific coloring, but they gradually turn yellow and then dark over time due to self-radiolysis from radium's alpha decay.
