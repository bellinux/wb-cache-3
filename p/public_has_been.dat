5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{a disastrous}} factor for domestic psychiatry {{is that those}} who had committed the crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way. Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> reduced to making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of {{the homes of the}} ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} the health of {{immigrants}} and the associated cost to the <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> largely discussed. On average, per capita health care spending is lower for immigrants {{than it is for}} native-born Americans. The non-emergency use of emergency rooms ostensibly indicates an incapacity to pay, yet some studies allege disproportionately lower access to unpaid health care by immigrants. For this and other reasons, there have been various disputes about how much immigration is costing the United States public health system. University of Maryland economist and Cato Institute scholar Julian Lincoln Simon concluded in 1995 that while immigrants probably pay more into the health system than they take out, {{this is not the case}} for elderly immigrants and refugees, who are more dependent on public services for survival.|$|E
25|$|Düsseldorf, Germany is {{the fashion}} capital of Germany {{as it is}} a major {{cultural}} center for the art and fashion scenes. The fashionable clothes trend took root in this city before 1949. 1949 is the date of the first fashion show staged in Düsseldorf. Fashion trends have occurred as access to more elegant clothing for the general <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a part of the culture for almost a century. Two times a year an event called the, “Voices of Fashion,” occurs and attracts many people to visit Düsseldorf to find the latest fashion items. There are famous designers that have made a name for themselves in Düsseldorf as well. Designers Sabine Schumacher, Peter O. Mahler, and Renate Harvan all design in Düsseldorf. To keep the creativity and passion for fashion alive in Düsseldorf everyday there are schools dedicated to fashion design in Düsseldorf as well. Akademie Mode and Design Institution, Design Department Academy, and Mode Design College are the three prominent fashion schools residing in Düsseldorf.|$|E
25|$|U.S. Public {{opinion on}} the One-China Policy is much more {{ambiguous}} than {{the opinions of the}} American political elites and policy experts. A Pew Research poll from 2012 found that 84% of policy experts believe it to be very important to for the U.S. to build a strong relationship with China, where as only 55% of the general public agreed with that statement . This vast difference of agreement between policy experts and the American <b>Public</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> translated into recent politics; Donald Trumps phone call 25 days after his inauguration to the President of Taiwan, breaking a decades old policy, possibly representing an expression of current polling showing negative attitudes towards The Peoples Republic of China. Furthermore, U.S. populist attitudes towards the Peoples Republic of China are negative, where China is viewed as an economic adversary rather than a friendly rival. A 2015 Pew Research poll found that 60% of Americans view the loss of jobs to China as very serious, compared to only 21% who view the tensions between China and Taiwan as very serious. Historical trends conducted by Gallup demonstrate an increase in perception among Americans that China is the leading economic power in the world today, with polls in 2000 showing only 10% agreeing with that statement and in 2016, 50% concurring with the statement.|$|E

500|$|In 2007 Goffman {{was listed}} by The Times Higher Education Guide as the sixth most-cited author in the {{humanities}} and social sciences, behind Anthony Giddens and ahead of Jürgen Habermas. His popularity with the general <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> attributed to his writing style, described as [...] "sardonic, satiric, jokey", and as [...] "ironic and self-consciously literary", and to its being more accessible than that of most academics. His style has also been influential in academia, and is credited with popularizing a less formal style in academic publications.|$|E
500|$|Marmarosa {{continued}} {{to perform in}} Pittsburgh, albeit irregularly. Around 1963, DeFranco dropped by; he recalled that the pianist [...] "would play brilliantly for half a tune, then just stop and walk away. He didn't even know who I was". Marmarosa's last performance in <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> dated variously as occurring in 1968 or the early-to-mid 1970s. Diabetes contributed to his permanent retirement.

500|$|Mossinger's {{warning to}} Mulder that some truths {{should be kept}} hidden from the <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> cited by {{scholars}} as representing the difficulty of forcing large organizations {{to take responsibility for}} wrongdoing. The episode's final revelation, that aliens have been on Earth [...] "for a long, long time", has been cited as following a trend of post-futurism established by science fiction cinema in the 1980s. This trend has replaced traditional science fiction topics such as space exploration with themes inspired by the Watergate scandal and the spread of conspiracy theories.|$|E
500|$|Stone {{went with}} her {{daughter}} to Chicago in May, 1893 and gave her last public speeches at the World's Congress of Representative Women where she saw a strong international involvement in women's congresses, with almost 500 women from 27 countries speaking at 81 meetings, and attendance topping 150,000 at the week-long event. Stone's immediate focus was on state referenda under consideration in New York and Nebraska. Stone presented a speech she had prepared entitled [...] "The Progress of Fifty Years" [...] wherein she described the milestones of change, and said [...] "I think, with never-ending gratitude, that the young women of today do not and can never know at what price their {{right to free speech}} and to speak at all in <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> earned." [...] Stone met with Carrie Chapman Catt and Abigail Scott Duniway to form a plan for organizing in Colorado, and Stone attended two days of meetings about getting a woman suffrage drive restarted in Kansas. Stone and her daughter returned home to Pope's Hill on May 28.|$|E

2500|$|The Second Scheme's {{subsequent}} {{rejection by}} the <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{cited as a}} case study in a failed attempt to artificially control the direction of a language's evolution.

2500|$|According to an {{editorial}} in Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger, the Polish criticism {{may be part of}} an anti-German campaign in which Steinbach has become the enemy stereotype and demonization of Steinbach is a kind of reason of state. The way she is portrayed to the Polish <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> described by some editorial writers as having rather [...] "hysteric features" [...] or a [...] "psychosis". Some German media blame conservative nationalists in the Law and Justice for having used her as a hate figure in internal politics to counter Donald Tusk ignoring Steinbach's real views.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has become}} a norm for Chinese {{communist}} leaders {{to make their own}} contributions to Marxist theory. [...] Whether this is Hu's contribution to Marxist theory is debatable, but its general reception with the Chinese <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> moderate. Its promotion, however, is visible almost everywhere: in classroom posters, banners on the street, and electronic display boards for the preparation of the 2008 Olympics, and World Expo 2010 in Shanghai. The codes differ from the ideologies of his predecessors, namely, Jiang's Three Represents, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and Mao Zedong Thought in that the focus, for the first time, has been shifted to codifying moral standards as opposed to setting social or economic goals.|$|E

2500|$|The {{greenhouse}} gas emissions from nuclear fission power are much smaller than those associated with coal, oil and gas, and the routine health risks are much smaller than those associated with coal. However, there is a [...] "catastrophic risk" [...] potential if containment fails, which in nuclear reactors can be brought about by overheated fuels melting and releasing large quantities of fission products into the environment. This potential risk could wipe out the benefits. The most long-lived radioactive wastes, including spent nuclear fuel, must be contained and isolated from the environment {{for a long period}} of time. On the other side, spent nuclear fuel could be reused, yielding even more energy, and reducing the amount of waste to be contained. The <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> made sensitive to these risks and there has been considerable public opposition to nuclear power.|$|E
2500|$|Disagreement {{with the}} verdict was heavily debated by the media, lawyers and psychologists, who put forth several {{theories}} for public dissatisfaction with the decision, ranging from wanting justice for Caylee, to the circumstantial evidence having been strong enough, to some blaming the media. UCLA forensic psychiatrist Dr. Carole Lieberman, said, [...] "The main reason that people are reacting so strongly is that the media convicted Casey before the jury decided on the verdict. The <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> whipped up into this frenzy wanting revenge for this poor little adorable child. And because of the desire for revenge, they've been whipped up into a lynch mob." [...] She added, [...] "Nobody likes a liar, and Anthony was a habitual liar. And nobody {{liked the fact that}} she was partying after Caylee's death. Casey obviously has a lot of psychological problems. Whether she murdered her daughter or not is another thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maurice Percy Ashley in The Times Literary Supplement gave a {{positive}} review {{to the book}} in the issue of 9 March 1940: [...] "In recent years the detective story-reading <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> so profusely drenched with thrills, 'wisecracks' and perverted psychology that one sometimes wonders whether there is still room for the old-fashioned straight-forward problem in detection. There are, however, a few first-class exponents of this art with us– though now that Miss Sayers has, for the moment at any rate, turned moralist and others have entered the easier field of thriller writing {{there seem to be}} increasingly few. Mrs. Christie in particular remains true to the old faith; and it is pleasant to be able to record that her hand has not lost its cunning". The reviewer regretted that Poirot had lost some of his 'foibles' and Hastings no longer featured in the plots but he ended on a high note: [...] "Like all Mrs Christie's work, it is economically written, the clues are placed before the reader with impeccable fairness, the red herrings are deftly laid and the solution will cause many readers to kick themselves. Some occasional readers of detective stories are wont to criticize Mrs Christie on the ground that her stories are insufficiently embroidered, that she includes, for instance, no epigrams over the college port. But is it not time to state that in the realm of detective fiction proper, where problems are fairly posed and fairly solved, there is no one to touch her?" ...|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{despite the}} Council's {{official}} disavowal of Mangin's layout of future streets, {{as the city}} grew the Mangin-Goerck Plan became the de facto reference for where new streets were built, and when the Commissioners' Plan was revealed in 1811, {{the area of the}} plan which the <b>public</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> warned was inaccurate and speculative <b>had</b> <b>been</b> accepted wholesale by the Commission, their plan being almost identical to Mangin's in that area.|$|R
