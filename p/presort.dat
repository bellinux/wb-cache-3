50|$|Presorting is the {{technique}} of sorting an input before attempting to search it. Because {{the addition of a}} sorting component to an algorithm is added to the runtime of the searching algorithm, and not multiplied, it only competes for the slowest portion of the algorithm. Since the efficiency of algorithms is measured by the slowest component, the addition of the sorting component is negligible if the search is less efficient. Unfortunately, presorting is usually the slowest component of the algorithm. Contrasting, a searching algorithm without a <b>presort</b> is almost always slower than that with a <b>presort.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Column-oriented {{database}} {{has gained}} popularity as “Data Warehousing ” data and performance issues for “Analytical Queries ” have increased. Each attribute of a relation is physically stored {{as a separate}} column, which will help analytical queries to work fast. The overhead is incurred in tuple reconstruction for multi attribute queries. Each tuple reconstruction is joining of two columns based on tuple IDs, making it significant cost component. For reducing cost, physical design have multiple <b>presorted</b> copies of each base table, such that tuples are already appropriately organized in different orders across the various columns. This paper proposes a novel design, called partitioning, that minimizes the tuple reconstruction cost. It achieves performance similar to using <b>presorted</b> data, but without requiring the heavy initial <b>presorting</b> step. In addition, it handles dynamic, unpredictable workloads with no idle time and frequent updates. Partitioning provides the direct loading of the data in respective partitions. Partitions are created on the fly and depend on distribution of data, which will work nicely in limited storage space environments...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 This study {{originated}} with industry recognition of inadequate flexibility in currently used procedures for grading, sizing, and packaging fresh apples in North Central Washington. Field-run apples are {{introduced into the}} process, and {{nearly all of the}} product must be placed in a marketing package in the process. Portions of the output products are stored for a 12 -month marketing period. Frequently during this marketing period there are changes in the types of packaging demanded. In recognition of this problem, research has developed prototype equipment for performing a <b>presorting</b> and presizing function. <b>Presorted</b> and presized apples could be returned to bulk bin storage for later selective market preparation. This study provides cost information on the application of this new procedure that should be useful to managers of packing plants. The principal objective of the study is to determine how the application of the new procedure would affect the production-point marketing margins. An intermediate objective is to establish industry structure and trends that might relate to the application of the new procedure. Cost analysis is limited to those operating input costs that would likely be affected by the application of the new procedure. An economic-engineering method of analysis is used to measure the relative efficiency of the old and new techniques. A sample of four representative apple packing lines was analyzed for rate of output in standard operating periods (eight-hour shifts) and for average costs per unit of output in these periods. Cost per unit of output associated with integrating the <b>presorting</b> and presizing function into the process was estimated. Operating and cost models were developed for both the standard packing line and the new method. From analysis of standard packing line operation, it was concluded that <b>presorting</b> and presizing the 50 per cent of the total seasonal volume with the lowest quality would improve the rate of product output on standard packing lines. This is the basis for estimating operating and cost models of the new technique. Models are based on annual seasonal output volumes of 210, 000, 28 O, 000 and 350, 000 boxes (42 pounds of apples per box). These volumes represent a majority of the larger packing plants in North Central Washington. Average operating input costs per unit of output increase due to the application of <b>presorting</b> and presizing. The increase was approximately. 025 per unit of output. This is one per cent of the average production-point marketing margin. Application of the new method would not increase the economic efficiency of this specific phase of grading, sizing, and packing fresh apples. The application of <b>presorting</b> and presizing and integration with the current packing line procedures in apple packing plants in North Central Washington could result in total cost savings in individual plants through the more efficient use of storage facilities. Approximately 20 per cent more product can be stored in refrigerated storage or modified atmosphere refrigerated storage in bulk form in bins as compared to finished product storage. <b>Presorting</b> and presizing 50 per cent of the field-nm product would also result in greatly improved flexibility in adapting to the market. The relatively small additional cost of application of this <b>presorting</b> and presizing function would improve the efficiency of many larger apple packing plants. The economic value would vary with each plant. Individual plant variables that should be analyzed are total seasonal volume and trends, storage capacity, current packing line efficiency, and marketing program...|$|R

40|$|Column-stores gained {{popularity}} as {{a promising}} physical de-sign alternative. Each attribute of a relation is physically stored {{as a separate}} column allowing queries to load only the required attributes. The overhead incurred is on-the-fly tuple reconstruction for multi-attribute queries. Each tu-ple reconstruction is a join of two columns based on tuple IDs, making it a significant cost component. The ultimate physical design is to have multiple <b>presorted</b> copies of each base table such that tuples are already appropriately orga-nized in multiple different orders across the various columns. This requires the ability to predict the workload, idle time to prepare, and infrequent updates. In this paper, we propose a novel design, partial side-ways cracking, that minimizes the tuple reconstruction cost in a self-organizing way. It achieves performance similar to using <b>presorted</b> data, but without requiring the heavy initial <b>presorting</b> step itself. Instead, it handles dynamic, unpredictable workloads with no idle time and frequent up-dates. Auxiliary dynamic data structures, called cracker maps, provide a direct mapping between pairs of attributes used together in queries for tuple reconstruction. A map is continuously physically reorganized {{as an integral part}} of query evaluation, providing faster and reduced data access for future queries. To enable flexible and self-organizing be-havior in storage-limited environments, maps are material-ized only partially as demanded by the workload. Each map is a collection of separate chunks that are individually reor-ganized, dropped or recreated as needed. We implemented partial sideways cracking in an open-source column-store. A detailed experimental analysis demonstrates that it brings significant performance benefits for multi-attribute queries...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} {{description of}} the k-d tree recognized that rebalancing techniques, such as are used to build an AVL tree or a red-black tree, are not applicable to a k-d tree. Hence, {{in order to build}} a balanced k-d tree, it is necessary to find the median of the data for each recursive subdivision of those data. The sort or selection that is used to find the median for each subdivision strongly influences the computational complexity of building a k-d tree. This paper discusses an alternative algorithm that builds a balanced k-d tree by <b>presorting</b> the data in each of k dimensions prior to building the tree. It then preserves the order of these k sorts during tree construction and thereby avoids the requirement for any further sorting. Moreover, this algorithm is amenable to parallel execution via multiple threads. Compared to an algorithm that finds the median for each recursive subdivision, this <b>presorting</b> algorithm has equivalent performance for four dimensions and better performance for three or fewer dimensions.
