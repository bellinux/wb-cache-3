40|$|Abstract — Vehicular sensor {{networks}} are {{emerging as a}} new network paradigm of primary relevance, especially for proactively gathering monitoring information in urban environments (<b>proactive</b> urban <b>monitoring).</b> Each vehicle, which typically has no strict constraints on processing power and storage capabilities, can sense one or more events (e. g., imaging from streets and detecting toxic chemicals), process sensed data (e. g., recognizing license plates) and route messages to other vehicles (e. g., diffusing relevant notification to drivers or police agents). In this novel and challenging mobile environment, sensors can generate a sheer amount of data, and traditional sensor network approaches for data reporting become infeasible. This paper proposes MobEyes, an efficient lightweight support for <b>proactive</b> urban <b>monitoring</b> based on the primary idea of exploiting vehicle mobility to opportunistically diffuse concise summaries describing sensed data. MobEyes harvests these summaries and builds a lowcost distributed index of the autonomous mobile storage of sensed data. The reported experimental/analytic results show that MobEyes-based indexing can achieve reasonable completeness with good scalability and limited overhead in completely decentralized deployment scenarios.

40|$|Abstract: The {{complexity}} of today’s networks {{can only be}} handled {{by the use of}} more and more sophisticated approaches and tools. A very promising approach is centralized policy based management. This means the policy for the entire administrative domain is managed from a single point. But defining and distributing a policy is only half the work as the policy has to be enforced – otherwise establishing a policy is pointless. This paper presents a tool for the continuous monitoring of networked systems and applications for the compliance with a given policy. The <b>Proactive</b> Security <b>Monitor</b> (PSM) employs <b>proactive</b> and reactive methods for monitoring the network. Apart from the “usual ” alert overview it also provides support for semi-automatic changes of the cur-rent policy. This can be useful if evidence suggests that a network is under stress and immediate reaction seems advisable. The <b>Proactive</b> Security <b>Monitor</b> is part of POSITIF, which itself will provide a frame-work and tools for centralized policy based management of networked systems and appli-cations (see [10]) ...|$|R

These uncertainties can be reduced by the effective use of health monitoring systems, through which information regarding in situ performance can be incorporated {{in the management of}} bridges. The objectives of this paper are twofold; first, an improved chloride induced deterioration model for concrete bridges is proposed that can quantify degradation in performance soon after chlorides are deposited on the bridge, rather than when initiation of corrosion at the reinforcement level takes place. As a result, the implications of introducing <b>proactive</b> health <b>monitoring</b> can be assessed using probabilistic durability criteria. Thus, the second objective of the paper is to present a methodology for performance updating of deteriorating concrete bridges fitted with a <b>proactive</b> health <b>monitoring</b> system.

The results highlight the benefits from introducing ‘smart’ technology in managing bridges subject to deterioration, and quantify the reduction in uncertainties and their subsequent effect on predictions of future bridge performance...|$|R

30|$|Recently, Meribout [24] {{proposed}} a secure wireless sensor network-based infrastructure {{for the detection}} of eventual leaks in multiphase pipelines, i.e., the pipelines which carry more than one fluid.

It uses an air-ultrasonic sensor and a bidirectional microphone to determine the location of the leak. However, the need of two layers makes this solution uneconomical for long-distance pipelines, and also the localization may not be fairly accurate due to the amount of noise involved in communication. Moreover, this solution does not provide <b>proactive</b> <b>monitoring</b> of pipeline health and requires high topology maintenance cost (e.g., battery power).|$|E

Vehicular sensor {{networks}} (VSNs) {{provide a}} collaborative sensing environment where mobile {{vehicles equipped with}} sensors of dif-ferent nature (from chemical detectors to still/video cameras) inter-work to implement monitoring applications such as traffic reporting, environ-ment monitoring, and distributed surveillance. In particular, there is an increasing interest in <b>proactive</b> urban <b>monitoring</b> where vehicles continu-ously sense events from streets, autonomously process sensed data (e. g., recognizing license plates), and possibly route messages to vehicles in their vicinity to achieve a common goal (e. g., to permit police agents to track the movements of specified cars). MobEyes is a middleware so-lution to support VSN-based <b>proactive</b> urban <b>monitoring</b> applications, where the agents (e. g., police cars) harvest metadata from regular VSN-enabled vehicles. Since multiple agents collaborate in a typical urban sensing operation, {{it is critical to}} design a mechanism to effectively co-ordinate their operations to the area where new information is rich in a completely decentralized and lightweight way. We present a novel agent coordination algorithm for urban sensing environments that has been de-signed based on biological inspirations such as foraging, stigmergy, and Lévy flight. The reported simulation results show that the proposed al-gorithm enables the agents to move to “information patches ” where new information concentration is high, and yet limits duplication of work due to simultaneous presence of agents in the same region...|$|R
