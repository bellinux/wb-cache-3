It appeared that the most satisfactory method of having the engine accessories such as pumps, governor, etc. easily maintained would be to drive them through a gear train at the forward end of the engine, that is, opposite the power take-off end. Having {{the location of the}} pumps all {{at one end of the}} engine, called the accessory drive end, fitted very well into locomotive installation. A leaf spring flexible drive gear mounted on the crankshaft was used to eliminate all crankshaft torsional vibration from the gear train."By using either one or two blowers for an 8 or 12 cylinder engine respectively and mounting them above the main generator, it was possible to shorten the overall length of the engine and generator installation. This was one of the main original objectives. The blowers as well as the camshafts were driven at the power take-off end of the engine by another gear train." ...|$|E

50|$|Throughout the {{remainder}} of the age of steam and into the early diesel era, passenger cars were heated by low pressure saturated steam supplied by the locomotive with the electricity for car lighting and ventilation being derived from batteries charged by axle-driven generators on each car or from engine-generator sets mounted under the carbody. Starting in the 1930s, air conditioning became available on railcars, with the energy to run them being provided by mechanical <b>power</b> <b>take</b> <b>offs</b> from the axle, small dedicated engines or propane.|$|R

The development of the area for tourism began in 1953/1954 with the construction of the Gerlosstein ski region, today the Zillertal Arena, which was soon followed by other lifts and the opening of the Mayrhofner Penkenbahn in 1954.

40|$|Three hazards, {{organic dust}} toxic {{syndrome}} (ODTS), confined spaces, and <b>power</b> <b>take</b> <b>offs</b> (PTOs) associated with farm machinery were discussed. ODTS {{is a little}} known respiratory illness that occurs following exposure to heavy concentrations of organic dusts contaminated with microorganisms. Because its symptoms, including general weakness, headache, chills, body aches, and cough, are similar {{to other forms of}} respiratory illness, it is often misdiagnosed and treated. Other common clinical characteristics of the illness included impaired pulmonary function, increase of white blood cells, and absence of antibodies typically associated with certain allergic lung disease, including farmer's lung with which it is most often confused. The risk of developing this illness can be reduced by being aware of the adverse effects of breathing organic dust when shoveling or moving organic materials such as oats, wood chips, composted leaves, and silage. Other risk reducing measures included: informing one's doctor of recent dust exposure when seeking treatment for respiratory illness, carefully harvesting and storing agricultural products to reduce spoilage, using automated or mechanized equipment to move decayed materials, using source containment, local exhaust ventilation, and wet methods of dust suppression, and using NIOSH approved respirators when exposure to organic dust cannot be avoided. Confined space hazards {{come in the form of}} manure pits, silos, vats, wells and digesters in the agricultural industry and present a multitude of risks including oxygen deficiency, flammable atmospheres, toxic gases, solvents, and mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic energy. Farm machinery presents the hazard of entanglement. A recent study reported that at least 346 farm workers aged 16 or older died from entanglement injuries between 1980 and 1989. Almost 10, 000 nonfatal entanglement injuries occurred between 1982 and 1986, 864 resulting in amputation, all caused by the use of inadequately guarded machinery and failure to follow proper safety precautions. Incidents of entanglement can be prevented by placing retrofit guards on farm equipment, disengaging the PTO, and turning off the tractor ignition before performing maintenance. DHHS publication; no.

50|$|The {{main gearbox}} was located behind {{the cabin and}} {{connected}} to the engine clutch housing via a short cardan shaft (this design enables a so-called flat floor cabin.) The main gearbox was bolted to an auxiliary gearbox, to a transfer case {{and then to a}} backbone tube and formed main part of a chassis structure. Options for the rear <b>power</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> and or a winch drive were available. Main and auxiliary gears were fully synchronized except the first and reverse gear. The new feature was unique 2-speed planetary overdrive system bolted between front and rear axles.The overdrive could only be selected manually whilst stationary. Auxiliary gearbox had a neutral position which allowed a winch and a <b>power</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> to use main gearbox gearing for variable speed operation.

5000|$|... 16. Plane balance - e.g. Compression on a boxer {{twin engine}} occurs at {{different}} planes on the crankshaft at different distances to clutch surface. A single plane (single row) radial engine {{does not have}} this plane imbalance except for a short mismatch between the power generating plane where the conrods are, and the <b>power</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> plane where the propeller is.|$|E
50|$|Some craft {{only use}} PAR thrust during takeoff; notable {{examples}} of this are the KM and Lun Ekranoplanes that situated their jet engines forward of the wing and deflected the thrust downwards under the wing. Once airborne and at a speed where sufficient lift was generated by the wing alone, the deflection could be removed. The KM required 10 turbojets to have enough <b>power</b> to <b>take</b> <b>off,</b> 8 of them operating in PAR mode; once in level flight, the engines could be throttled back extensively or some of them even shut off.|$|R
5000|$|The first free-flight {{trials of}} the 14-bis {{took place at the}} Polo Ground in the Bois de Boulogne on 21 August, but were halted by damage to the newly fitted aluminium-bladed propeller, which {{replaced}} one with silk-covered wooden blades. [...] After repairs another trial took place the following day; although the nosewheel left the ground, the aircraft had insufficient <b>power</b> to <b>take</b> <b>off,</b> and Santos-Dumont decided to replace the engine with a [...] Antoinette. [...] Trials resumed on 4 September without great success, and on 7 September after the propeller was damaged a new slightly larger one was fitted.|$|R
50|$|The {{extremely}} long {{profile of}} the new design meant that the crankshaft would be highly loaded if <b>power</b> was <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> at the propeller end. Chrysler's {{solution to this problem}} was unique; <b>power</b> was instead <b>taken</b> {{from the middle of the}} engine, placing the propeller reduction gear in a gap between two V-8 cylinder banks and sending power to the front of the engine via a long extension shaft running below the crankshaft. Additionally many of the accessories were driven off the drive shaft instead of the crank shaft. This solution also raised the weight of the engine by the amount of the shaft, but it was apparently a price worth paying.|$|R

50|$|After the U.S. entered World War I the Dayton-Wright Company began {{manufacturing}} bomber and reconnaissance planes. Freeman was {{tasked with}} testing the planes. On June 27, 1918, the engine on Freeman's plane suddenly lost <b>power</b> during <b>take</b> <b>off.</b> However, {{he was able}} to land the plane. The mechanics went over the engine's fuel system and Freeman attempted another <b>take</b> <b>off.</b> The engine failed again, but Freeman was once again able to land it safely. The engine failed once more on the third takeoff, however a strong wind prevented Freeman from making the 360° turn needed to land the plane and it forcefully struck the ground. Freeman's head hit the instrument panel with such force that the ignition switches dug themselves into his head. He was driven to the nearest hospital where he was declared dead by an emergency room doctor.|$|R
