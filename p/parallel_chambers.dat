Remains of the Iberian defensive wall {{are visible}} {{on the east side}} of the castle.The foundations of the Roman forum, together with those of some Iberian buildings, and those of a Roman temple or capitolium, are all located in the forum area of the castle, upon the hilltop. The ruins of the Roman buildings are laid out around a square measuring 60 by 36.5 m. The plaza was fronted on the west side by a basilica that measured 60 by 20 m. The east side of the square was lined by a row of tabernae (shops). To the south of the plaza is a well-preserved cistern, and the base of the temple or capitolium are on the north side. The temple measured 14 by 12 m. A complex building was situated on the northeast side of the plaza; it has not been securely identified but it may have been a curia (assembly or court building) or a temple of Augustus. Since it possessed two large <b>parallel</b> <b>chambers,</b> it may have served both functions. The remains of a Roman theatre stand some 50 m down the hillside to the northwest of the forum.

40|$|Abstract only availableFaculty Mentor: Dr. Vladislav Glinskii, BiologyBreast {{cancer is}} the second most common cancer in North American women. It has the {{propensity}} to metastaticize to bone and bone marrow. Such metastases, causing intractable pain, pathological fractures, and death are massive clinical problems. In order to establish secondary tumors in bones, blood-borne metastatic cells should adhere to the endothelium lining the walls of the bone marrow microvessels. In this study, we evaluated the suitability of the <b>parallel</b> flow <b>chamber</b> technique for studying metastatic breast cancer cell adhesive interaction with cultured human bone marrow microvascular cells (HBMEC). We have found that, similar to leukocytes, a fraction of breast cancer cells infuse through the <b>parallel</b> flow <b>chamber</b> over the HBMEC monolayer exhibiting rolling behavior. Some rolling cells adhere permanently to the endothelium. The rolling and stable adhesion kinetics depends on experimental conditions such as shear rate and shear stress. In conclusion, the <b>parallel</b> flow <b>chamber</b> technique represents the valuable method of choice for analyzing the adhesive interaction of metastatic cancer cells with endothelium under conditions of physiological flow conditions...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyze the standard procedure for the accurate determination of absorbed dose to water at electron and photon clinical beams with energy up to 25 MeV. To this aim a number of cavity chambers of cylindrical and plane-parallel types were used. Emphasis is directed towards {{the analysis of the}} internal consistency of the Italian AIFB dosimetry protocol when applied to different types of ionization chambers. Some comparative measurement by a graphite calorimeter was also made to have an absolute and independent determination of the absorbed dose values. Measurements at photon and electron beams by cylindrical chambers give consistent results. At electron beams plane-parallel chambers show some appreciable deviations in the absorbed dose values. In this case it is likely that the electron fluence perturbation factors, currently assumed equal to unity, differ from unity for the chambers and at the energies involved. Final results are discussed as far as chamber characteristics and protocol consistency are concerned. A review of the various national and international dosimetry protocol for the determination of absorbed dose to water in high energy electron and photon beam is also presented in this thesis. To develop standard procedures for the calibration of plane <b>parallel</b> <b>chambers</b> using Co- 60 gamma-ray beam free in air, the influence of various build-up materials is studied and the composite correction factor kpp determined.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a simulation and optimization tool for ship lock scheduling capable of simulating {{the effects of}} infrastructural changes upon traffic handling at a ship lock with <b>parallel</b> <b>chambers.</b> Simulation parameters are determined via an analysis of historical data. The tool’s accuracy is ascertained via a simulation of the current operations at the lock. The effect of infrastructural changes upon traffic handling may then be accurately assessed via new simulations. The downtimes of lock chambers due to canal drainage requirements, for example, represent a particularly interesting element of the simulation’s input. Optimization of traffic handling in the new infrastructural environment is consequently performed to increase the ship lock’s throughput and decrease passage times for ships. Results demonstrate the huge influence drainage policy has upon passage times, how optimizing the process results in greatly improved lock traffic handling and finally how it is in lock proprietors’ best interest to seriously consider alternatives for chamber drainage downtimes. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} an operational planning problem in waterway transportation. Consider a single lock {{that consists of}} m <b>parallel</b> <b>chambers.</b> The chambers operate independently {{of each other and}} are each characterized by two numbers: their lockage time and their capacity. The term lockage time refers to the time needed to bring a ship from the downstream water level to the upstream water level, or vice versa. The capacity gives an upper bound on the number of ships that may simultaneously be present within a chamber. Ships arrive at the locks at given times. A ship can arrive either from the upstream side, or from the downstream side (this is called the position of a ship). Our interest is on the existence of so-called no-wait schedules; these are schedules in which no ship has to wait. A relevant special case is the setting with two distinct chambers, and all ships having the same position (the uni-directional case). We show how this problem is related to interval scheduling, we give necessary and sufficient conditions determining the existence of a no-wait schedule in the special case described above, and we show how to find such a schedule in linear time. We prove that the uni-directional case of the problem is NP-complete in case the number of chambers is part of the input. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Ships {{must often}} pass {{one or more}} locks when {{entering}} or leaving a tide independent port or when travelling on a network of waterways. These locks control the flow {{and the level of}} inland waterways, or provide a constant water level for ships while loading or unloading at the docks. We consider locks with a single chamber or several (possibly different) <b>parallel</b> <b>chambers,</b> which can transfer one or more ships in a single operation. The resulting lock scheduling problem consists of three strongly interconnected sub problems: scheduling the lockages, assigning ships to chambers, and positioning the ships inside the chambers. By combining the first two problems into a master problem and using the packing problem as a sub problem, a decomposition is achieved for which an efficient Combinatorial Benders approach has been developed. The master problem is solved first, thereby sequencing the ships into a number of lockages. Next, the feasibility of each lockage is verified by solving the corresponding packing sub problem, possibly returning a number of combinatorial inequalities (cuts) to the master problem. Experiments on a large test set show that this decomposition method strongly outperforms an existing monolithic approach, especially for instances with a complex packing sub problem. New optimal results for instances with up to 90 ships are generated in less than 12 hours, while a heuristic version of the algorithm generates (near) optimal results for instances with up to 50 ships in less than 10 minutes. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In this study, {{calculation}} of absorbed doses according to three different IAEA protocols for 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, and 18 MeV electron energies were compared. METHODS: Absorbe dose measurements {{were made at}} SSD= 95 cm distance, 10 x 10 cm standart cone and reference depth. Electron energies was measured with five different cylindirical chambers and three different paralel plate chambers. Polarity and recombination effects were measured for all ionization chambers and energies before absorbed dose measurements. RESULTS: After the measurements, calculations were made according to three different protocols. For Marcus <b>parallel</b> plate <b>chambers,</b> the ratio of absorbe dose protocols was between - 2. 04 % to 2. 64 %. Except from Marcus for other <b>parallel</b> plate <b>chamber</b> difference was between 0. 11 % to 3. 38 % for 6 MeV, 0. 33 % to 1. 37 % for 8 MeV, 0. 12 % to 1. 71 % for 10 MeV, 1. 35 % to 0. 23 % for 12 MeV, 1. 69 % to 0. 24 % for 15 MeV and 0. 22 % to 1. 74 % for 18 MeV.
