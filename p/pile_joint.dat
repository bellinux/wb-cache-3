40|$|AbstractUse {{of steel}} piles in general has {{continuously}} {{increased in the}} Nordic countries {{as well as in}} the harbour structures of the Baltics and Western Europe. The main reasons are the innovative, easy-to-handle but rigid and durable <b>pile</b> <b>joints,</b> application of steel material technology and higher steel strength. The importance of the resistance and stiffness of mechanical joints of slender steel piles is accentuated in soft soil conditions. The wide product range and different installation methods enable versatile applications from light- weight to heavily loaded structures in all soil conditions. In harbour structures bending resistance of the pile is often the dimensioning factor. The latest innovations are the highly rigid retaining wall structure, the RD pile wall installed by drilling in all possible soil conditions and steel piles serving as energy piles that exploit renewable ground source energy both for heating and cooling. There has been wide co-operation in Finland between steel pile manufacturers, contractors, designers, manufacturers of piling equipment, researchers and authorities in developing steel pile technology for almost thirty years...|$|R

40|$|The {{past ten}} year period showed the {{occurance}} {{of a great}} number of new construction terms in the Lithua- nian language. Thus it is necessary to collect and systematize construction terms, terminoids, quasi-terms and standardize them {{from the point of view}} of the Standard Lithuanian Language taking into account both logic and terminology requirements. This article deals with modern construction terms from the point of view of the Standard Lithuanian Language including newest data bases saving all actual information on them. The reseach showed that The Dictionary of Construction Terms (2003) ought to be included into The Lithuanian language Term Bank ([URL] It is necessary to be done for the following reasons. Firstly, because of the creation and standartization as well as sistematization process of new construction terms. Secondly, for the development of continuous scientific discusion and successful professional education. It was established that a certain number of construction terms from the point of view of the Standard Lithuanian Language should be included into new Dictionary of Construction Terms as well as into Term Bank of the Lithuanian Republic. The terms analysed in the article are concerning basement types, <b>pile</b> types, construction <b>joints,</b> also details of walls, roofs, chimneys, construction materials and etc. The analysis showed how different morphological variants and undesirable synonymous terms occur. Finally, the analysis helped to identify that the informal terms mix with formal, standard terms and conclude in incorrect term usage...|$|R

The stacks mimic the terminal surface active phospholipid SAPL coatings on cartilage in mammalian <b>joints.</b> <b>Piles</b> of 11 bilayer membranes of 1, 2 dimyristoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine DMPC are immobilized at the interface {{of the solid}} silicon support and the liquid D 2 O backing phase. We replace the natural hyaluronic acid HA component of synovial fluid by a synthetic substitute, namely, poly allylamine hydrochloride PAH, at identical concentration. We find the oligolamellar DMPC bilayer films strongly interacting with PAR resulting in a drastic increase of the membranes d spacing {{by a factor of}} similar to 5. Onset of shear causes a buckling like deformation of the DMPC bilayers perpendicular to the applied shear field. With increasing shear rate we observe substantially enhanced water fractions in the membrane slabs which we attribute to increasing fragmentation caused by Kelvin Helmholtz like instabilities parallel to the applied shear field. Both effects are in line with recent theoretical predictions on shear induced instabilities of lipid bilayer membranes in water Hanasald, I.; Walther, J. H.; Kawano, S.; Koumoutsakos, P. Phys. Rev. E 2010, 82, 051602. With the applied shear the interfacial lipid linings transform from their gel state Pi to their fluid state La. Although in chain molten state with reduced bending rigidity the lipid layers do not detach from their solid support. We hold steric bridging of the fragmented lipid bilayer membranes by PAR molecules responsible for the unexpected mechanical stability of the DMPC lining...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{practice}} often adopts {{analytical methods}} developed for soils {{based on the}} continuum approach when designing laterally-loaded piles socketed into rock mass. High safety considerations and the uncertainties arising from the assumption of continuum rock mass may produce inefficient and unsafe design solutions to foundation problems subjected to lateral loads. To date, the {{research in the area}} of laterally-loaded rock-socketed piles has not been advanced sufficiently. The available analytical methods assume rocks to be intact and homogenous materials, and the physical effect of joints is not taken into account. Therefore, this study aims to develop an analytical method for laterally-loaded piles socketed into rock mass incorporating the physical effect of joints. A three-dimensional distinct element code, 3 DEC, was utilised to simulate the behaviour of laterally-loaded piles socketed into mudstone rock. The capability of 3 DEC to model jointed rock mass was first examined by simulating the confined (triaxial) and unconfined (uniaxial compressive test) loading conditions. The results obtained from this modelling were compared with existing empirical relationships and field test data. 3 DEC was then employed to simulate laboratory-scale model pile-load tests. A comprehensive parametric study was carried out based on the calibrated laboratory 3 DEC model. It was found that the most influential parameters impacting the lateral behaviour of piles socketed into jointed mudstone are rock modulus, pile diameter, pile bending stiffness, <b>pile</b> socket length, <b>joint</b> dip angle and spacing. Based on the understanding of the key influential parameters affecting lateral load behaviour, 3 DEC modelling was extended further to simulate full-scale pile load tests conducted in Melbourne mudstone. Based on extensive numerical modelling, the p-y behaviour of piles socketed into mudstone was derived. It was found that a single p-y curve for mudstone accurately predicts pile-head load-deflection behaviour. Subsequently, a thorough parametric study based on full-scale models was carried out to study the effect of joints on the lateral load capacity of piles. This study found that joint sets in different directions have a significant impact on the p-y and the corresponding pile-head load-deflection behaviour. The worst-case condition of four joint sets reduces the load-carrying capacity of the pile by more than 90 % compared to a homogenous mudstone. This is due to the deformation mechanisms of the pile-rock system such as the formation of weak wedges/pyramid blocks around the pile. The results obtained from the extensive parametric study were integrated in the derivation of new p-y criteria for laterally-loaded piles socketed into homogenous and jointed mudstone rocks. The p-y criteria developed require basic rock properties which can be conveniently obtained in the laboratory or using the well-established empirical relationships for mudstone based on water content. The p-y criterion proposed for homogenous mudstone condition was validated using the results of another two field pile-load tests. For the p-y criterion of jointed mudstone, a field load test of a pile with an apparent steep joint in the vicinity of the pile was employed to validate its accuracy. It was found that the p-y criterion for jointed mudstone gives a slightly more conservative prediction of the pile-head load-deflection response. It is suggested that the p-y criterion for homogenous and jointed mudstone conditions will provide the upper and lower bound solutions, respectively. This study has successfully developed an analytical method for laterally-loaded piles socketed into mudstone. The proposed design approach pioneers the integration of the physical effect of joints on the p-y behaviour of piles socketed into jointed mudstone. The proposed p-y criteria were validated using field pile load tests and very close predictions were achieved...|$|R
