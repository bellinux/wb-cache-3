50|$|Further {{research}} has determined calcium's role in long-term depression induction. While other mechanisms of long-term depression are being investigated, calcium's role in LTD is a defined and well understood mechanism by scientists. High calcium {{concentrations in the}} post-synaptic Purkinje cells is a necessity for the induction of long-term depression. There are several sources of calcium signaling that elicit LTD: climbing fibres and parallel fibres which converge onto Purkinje cells. Calcium signaling in the post-synaptic cell involved both spatial and temporal overlap of climbing fibre induced calcium release into dendrites as well as <b>parallel</b> <b>fibre</b> induced mGluRs and IP3 mediated calcium release. In the climbing fibres, AMPAR-mediated depolarization induces a regenerative action potential that spreads to the dendrites, which is generated by voltage-gated calcium channels. Paired with PF-mediated mGluR1 activation results in LTD induction. In the parallel fibres, GluRs are activated by constant activation of the parallel fibres which indirectly induces the IP3 to bind to its receptor (IP3) and activate calcium release from intracellular storage. In calcium induction, {{there is a positive}} feedback loop to regenerate calcium for long-term depression.Climbing and parallel fibres must be activated together to depolarize the Purkinje cells while activating mGlur1s. Timing is a critical component to CF and PF as well, a better calcium release involves PF activation a few hundred milliseconds before CF activity.|$|E
50|$|LTD {{occurs at}} synapses in {{cerebellar}} Purkinje neurons, which receive {{two forms of}} excitatory input, one from a single climbing fiber and one from {{hundreds of thousands of}} parallel fibers. LTD decreases the efficacy of parallel fiber synapse transmission, though, according to recent findings, it also impairs climbing fiber synapse transmission. Both parallel fibers and climbing fibers must be simultaneously activated for LTD to occur. With respect to calcium release however, it is best if the parallel fibers are activated a few hundred milliseconds before the climbing fibres. In one pathway, parallel fiber terminals release glutamate to activate AMPA and metabotropic glutamate receptors in the postsynaptic Purkinje cell. When glutamate binds to the AMPA receptor, the membrane depolarizes. Glutamate binding to the metabotropic receptor activates phospholipase C (PLC) and produces diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) second messengers. In the pathway initiated by activation of climbing fibers, calcium enters the postsynaptic cell through voltage-gated ion channels, raising intracellular calcium levels. Together, DAG and IP3 augment the calcium concentration rise by targeting IP3-sensitive receptors triggering release of calcium from intracellular stores as well as protein kinase C (PKC) activation (which is accomplished jointly by calcium and DAG). PKC phosphorylates AMPA receptors, which promotes their dissociation from scaffold proteins in the post-synaptic membrane and subsequent internalization. With the loss of AMPA receptors, the postsynaptic Purkinje cell response to glutamate release from parallel fibers is depressed. Calcium triggering in the cerebellum is a critical mechanism involved in long-term depression. <b>Parallel</b> <b>fibre</b> terminals and climbing fibres work together in a positive feedback loop for invoking high calcium release.|$|E

Pharmacological activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin caused LTP at Purkinje neurons, but only transient potentiation at Bergmann glia, reinforcing the concept that ectopic sites lack the capacity to express sustained cAMP-dependent potentiation. Activation of mGluR 1 caused depression of synaptic transmission via retrograde endocannabinoid signalling but had no significant effect at ectopic sites. In contrast, activation of NMDA receptors suppressed both synaptic and ectopic transmission. The results suggest that the signalling mechanisms for presynaptic LTP and retrograde depression by endocannabinoids are restricted to the active zone at <b>parallel</b> <b>fibre</b> synapses, allowing independent modulation of synaptic transmission to Purkinje neurons and ectopic transmission to Bergmann glia.

In the presence of antagonists for iGluRs and for GABA(A) receptors, brief tetanic activation evoked a slow metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) -dependent EPSP (mGluR-EPSP). This mGluR-EPSP was blocked by the selective mGluR 1 antagonists LY 367385 and CPCCOEt, but not by the mGluR 5 antagonist MPEP. Group II agonists affected neither iGluR-EPSP nor mGluR-EPSP. Conversely, L-AP 4 and L-SOP, group III mGluR agonists, inhibited both iGluR- and mGluR-EPSPs. The depolarisations evoked by both AMPA and group I agonists were unaffected, indicating a presynaptic action of group III mGluRs.

40|$|Adenosine is an {{important}} signalling molecule involved in {{a large number of}} physiological functions. In the brain these processes are as diverse as sleep, memory, locomotion and neuroprotection during episodes of ischaemia and hypoxia. Although the actions of adenosine, through cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors, are well characterized, in many cases the sources of adenosine and mechanisms of release have not been defined. Here we demonstrate the activity-dependent release of adenosine in the cerebellum using a combination of electrophysiology and biosensors. Short trains of electrical stimuli delivered to the molecular layer in vitro, release adenosine via a process that is both TTX and Ca 2 + sensitive. As ATP release cannot be detected, adenosine must either be released directly or rapidly produced by highly localized and efficient extracellular ATP breakdown. Since adenosine release can be modulated by receptors that act on parallel fibre-Purkinje cell synapses, we suggest that the <b>parallel</b> <b>fibres</b> release adenosine. This activity-dependent adenosine release exerts feedback inhibition of parallel fibre-Purkinje cell transmission. Spike-mediated adenosine release from <b>parallel</b> <b>fibres</b> will thus powerfully regulate cerebellar circuit output. ...|$|R

40|$|Deep {{cerebellar}} nuclei neurons receive both inhibitory (GABAergic) synaptic currents from Purkinje cells (within the cerebellar cortex) and excitatory (glutamatergic) synaptic currents from mossy fibres. Those two deep cerebellar nucleus inputs {{are thought}} to be also adaptive, embedding interesting properties in the framework of accurate movements. We show that distributed spike-timing-dependent plasticity mechanisms (STDP) located at different cerebellar sites (<b>parallel</b> <b>fibres</b> to Purkinje cells, mossy fibres to deep cerebellar nucleus cells, and Purkinje cells to deep cerebellar nucleus cells) in close-loop simulations provide an explanation for the complex learning properties of the cerebellum in motor learning. Concretely, we propose a new mechanistic cerebellar spiking model. In this new model, deep cerebellar nuclei embed a dual functionality: deep cerebellar nuclei acting as a gain adaptation mechanism and as a facilitator for the slow memory consolidation at mossy fibres to deep cerebellar nucleus synapses. Equipping the cerebellum with excitatory (e-STDP) and inhibitory (i-STDP) mechanisms at deep cerebellar nuclei afferents allows the accommodation of synaptic memories that were formed at <b>parallel</b> <b>fibres</b> to Purkinje cells synapses and then transferred to mossy fibres to deep cerebellar nucleus synapses.

Increases of cerebellar blood flow (CeBF) and extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o) were evoked by stimulation of parallel fibres and climbing fibres, and by microinjection of KCl into the cortex. For <b>parallel</b> <b>fibre</b> stimulation, there was a maximal increase in [K+]o to 6. 3 ± 0. 5 mm and in CeBF of 122 ± 11 %. Climbing fibre stimulation gave a maximal increase in [K+]o to 4. 4 ± 0. 2 mm and in CeBF of 157 ± 20 %. This indicates different maxima for [K+]o and CeBF, dependent on the afferent system activated. [K+]o and CeBF responses evoked by parallel or climbing fibre stimulation increased rapidly {{at the onset of}} stimulation, but exhibited different time courses during the remainder of the stimulation period and during return to baseline. Microinjections of KCl into the cortex increased [K+]o to levels comparable to those evoked by <b>parallel</b> <b>fibre</b> stimulation.

40|$|Several {{antibodies}} {{directed against}} the heterogeneous microtubule-associated protein group tau {{have been used to}} determine the immunocytochemical localization of these proteins in the developing rat cerebellum. Immunoblot analysis of brain extracts showed that both monoclonal and polyclonal anti-tau antibodies revealed not only the adult tau proteins (50, 000 - 70, 000 mol. wt) but also the immature (48, 000 mol. wt) tau form. Immunocytochemical studies showed that, whatever the stage of development, anti-tau antibodies stained several types of axonal fibres. The Purkinje cell bodies and their dendrites were never significantly labelled. This means that immature tau is, as adult tau, localized essentially in axons. Axonal labelling seems to follow the cerebellar developmental pattern. For instance, the climbing fibres which reach the cerebellum during the embryonic life were stained soon after birth by the anti-tau antibodies. In contrast, the <b>parallel</b> <b>fibres,</b> that begin to develop perinatally, do not express tau at early (5 days) postnatal stages; a clear labelling of the deeper <b>parallel</b> <b>fibres</b> (which are more mature than the superficial ones) was seen at day 10 after birth {{in the vicinity of the}} developing dendrites of the Purkinje cells. This suggests that (1) the appearance of tau immunoreactivity reflects a certain stage of maturity of the parallel fibre; (2) both immature and mature tau microtubule-associated proteins seem to be axon specific in the developing rat cerebellum.

40|$|In anaesthetized rats, {{pairs of}} {{cerebellar}} Golgi cells fired synchronously at rest, provided they were aligned along the <b>parallel</b> <b>fibre</b> axis. The observed synchrony {{was much less}} precise, however, than that which {{would be expected to}} result from common, monosynaptic <b>parallel</b> <b>fibre</b> excitation. To explain this discrepancy, the precision and frequency of spike synchronization (i. e. the width and area of the central peak on the spike train cross-correlogram) were computed in a generic model for varying input, synaptic and neuronal parameters. Correlation peaks between model neurons became broader, and peak area smaller, when the number of afferents increased and each single synapse decreased proportionally in strength. Peak width was inversely proportional to firing rate, but independent of the percentage of shared afferents. Peak area, in contrast, scaled with the percentage of shared afferents but was almost firing rate independent. Broad correlation peaks between pairs of model neurons resulted from the loose spike timing between single model neurons and their afferents. This loose timing reflected a need for long-term synaptic integration to fire the neurons. Model neurons could accomplish this through firing rate adaptation mediated by a Ca 2 +-activated K+ channel. We conclude that loose synchrony may be entirely explained by shared input from monosynaptic, non-synchronized afferents. The inverse relationship between peak width and firing rate allowed us to distinguish common <b>parallel</b> <b>fibre</b> input from firing rate covariance as a primary cause of loose synchrony between cerebellar Golgi cells in anaesthetized rats...|$|E
40|$|The purine {{adenosine}} {{plays an}} important role in a number of physiological and pathological processes and is neuroprotective during hypoxia and ischemia. The major effect of adenosine is to suppress network activity via the activation of A 1 receptors. Here we report that in immature cerebellar slices, the activation of A 1 receptors has variable effects on <b>parallel</b> <b>fibre</b> synaptic transmission, ranging from zero depression to an almost complete abolition of transmission. Concentration–response curves suggest that the heterogeneity of inhibition stems from differences in A 1 receptor properties which could include coupling to downstream effectors. There is less variation in the effects of adenosine at <b>parallel</b> <b>fibre</b> synapses in slices from older rats and thus adenosine signalling appears developmentally regulated. In the cerebellum, hypoxia increases the concentration of extracellular adenosine leading to the activation of A 1 receptors (at adenosine-sensitive <b>parallel</b> <b>fibre</b> synapses) and the suppression of glutamate release. It would be predicted that the synapses that were insensitive to adenosine would be less depressed by hypoxia and thus maintain function during metabolic stress. However those synapses which were insensitive to adenosine were rapidly inhibited by hypoxia via a mechanism which was not reversed by blocking A 1 receptors. Thus another mechanism must be responsible for the hypoxia-mediated depression at these synapses. These different mechanisms of depression may be important for cell survival and for maintenance of cerebellar function following oxygen starvation...|$|E

Changes in presynaptic Ca 2 + influx were determined with the Ca 2 +-sensitive dyes fluo- 4 FF AM or fluo- 3 AM. Five stimulations delivered at 100 Hz or single stimulations of parallel fibres evoked rapid and reproducible transient increases in presynaptic fluo- 4 FF or fluo- 3 fluorescence, respectively, which decayed to prestimulus levels within a few hundred milliseconds. Bath application of the selective CB 1 agonist WIN 55, 212 - 2 (1 μm) markedly reduced the peak amplitude of these fluorescence transients. This effect was fully reversed by the selective CB 1 antagonist SR 141716 -A (1 μm).

We have used an in vitro culture model in which to investigate the ephrin effect on Purkinje cell dendritic spines {{and the role of}} integrins in these changes. We found that integrins α 3, α 5 and β 4 are present in many of the dendritic spines of cultured Purkinje cells. pFAK, the main downstream signalling molecule from integrins, has a similar distribution, although the intenstity of pFAK staining and the percentage of pFAK+ spines was consistently higher in the proximal dendrites. Activating integrins with Mg 2 + led to an increase in the intensity of pFAK staining and an increase in the proportion of pFAK+ spines in both the proximal and distal dendrites, but no change in spine length, density or morphology. Blocking integrin binding with an RGD-containing peptide led to a reduction in spine length, with more stubby spines on both proximal and distal dendrites. Treatment of the cultures with ephrinA 3 -Fc chimera suppressed dendritic spines specifically on the proximal dendrites and there was also a decrease of pFAK in spines on this domain. This effect was blocked by simultaneous activation of integrins with Mn 2 +. We conclude that Eph/ephrin signaling regulates proximal dendritic spines in Purkinje cells by inactivating integrin downstream signalling...|$|R

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of P 3 HT nanopatterns (lamellae and fibres) {{within a few}} minutes, in standard laboratory conditions (i. e., at room temperature and in air) and over areas as large as cm 2, is reported. The nanostructures are prepared using a wet-processing method. A satisfactory control over the pattern topology (lamellae, hierarchically connected and <b>parallel</b> <b>fibres,</b> entangled but disconnected and quasiparallel fibres, randomly oriented fibres) is obtained by simply changing one process parameter. UV-vis spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses carried out over the so-fabricated structures evidence a very high degree of supramolecular organization of the polymeric chains. Such a degree of order is similar or even better than that of P 3 HT samples treated with thermal or solvent annealing procedures...|$|R
