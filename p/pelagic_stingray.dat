5|$|Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} morphology, {{found that the}} <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> {{is one of the}} more basal members of its family, being the sister taxon to a clade that {{contains}} Pastinachus, Dasyatis, and Indo-Pacific Himantura species. Other common names for the <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> include the blue stingray and the violet stingray.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> was {{originally}} described by French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in the 1832 third volume of Iconografia della fauna italica per le quattro classi degli animali vertebrati. He named it Trygon violacea, from the Latin viola ("purple"), and designated two specimens collected off Italy as the species syntypes. The genus Trygon {{has since been}} synonymized with Dasyatis. In 1910, American zoologist Henry Weed Fowler placed the <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> in the newly created subgenus Pteroplatytrygon, from the Greek pteron ("fin"), platus ("broad"), and trygon ("stingray"). Later authors elevated Pteroplatytrygon {{to the rank of}} full genus, though some taxonomists dispute whether this species is distinct enough to warrant separation from Dasyatis.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Lisa Rosenberger {{published}} a phylogenetic analysis of 14 Dasyatis species, based on morphology. The common stingray {{was reported to}} be the most basal member of the genus, other than the bluespotted stingray (D. kuhlii) and <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> (D. violacea). However, D. violacea has generally been recognized as belonging to its own genus Pteroplatytrygon, and recently D. kuhlii has also been placed in a different genus, Neotrygon.|$|E
50|$|Oscillation {{is viewed}} as pectoral-fin-based {{swimming}} and {{is best known as}} mobuliform locomotion. The motion can be described as the production of less than half a wave on the fin, similar to a bird wing flapping. <b>Pelagic</b> <b>stingrays,</b> such as the manta, cownose, eagle and bat rays use oscillatory locomotion.|$|R
40|$|Incidental {{by-catch}} {{and associated}} discarding {{are difficult to}} estimate {{on the basis of}} logbook information because they are poorly reported by fishing masters and their importance varies with several interrelated factors. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to inform the commonly discarded fishes of the Indonesian tuna longline fishery in the Indian Ocean. The study was carried out during 2010 – 2011 following six commercial tuna longline vessels based in Port of Benoa. Discards composition was dominated by longnose lancetfish and <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingrays</b> which composed almost half of total discards. Almost half of total catch are discards and half of discards are disposed dead or dying...|$|R
5|$|<b>Pelagic</b> <b>stingrays</b> may {{segregate}} by sex, vertically in {{that males}} {{are found in}} deeper water than females, and perhaps horizontally as well. Captive individuals often act highly aggressively towards ocean sunfish (Mola mola), biting and harassing them, particularly if they are hungry. This species is preyed upon by oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus), great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), toothed whales, and other large, ocean-going carnivores. Its all-around dark coloration likely serves to camouflage it against its featureless habitat. The venom on its tail spine is also quite potent, causing it to be avoided by other fishes. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium benedeni, A. crassicolle, and A. filicolle, Rhinebothrium baeri and R. palombii, and Tetragonocephalum uarnak, and the monogenean Entobdella diadema.|$|R
5|$|The diet of the <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> {{consists}} of free-swimming invertebrates and bony fishes. It {{is an active}} hunter, using its pectoral fins to trap and move food to its mouth, and {{has been known to}} take advantage of seasonal feeding opportunities such as spawning squid. Like other stingrays, it is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the embryos are sustained initially by yolk and later by histotroph ("uterine milk"). With a short gestation period of 24 months, females may bear two litters of 413 pups per year. Birthing generally occurs in warm water near the equator, {{with the exception of the}} Mediterranean Sea, with the timing varying between regions. Rarely encountered except by fishery workers, the <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> can inflict a severe, even fatal wound with its tail spine. This species is caught as bycatch throughout its range; it is of little economic value and usually discarded, often with high mortality. However, there is evidence that its numbers are increasing, perhaps owing to the heavy fishing of its natural predators and competitors (e.g., sharks). Along with the pelagic stingray's global distribution and prolific life history, this has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> is not {{aggressive}} and rarely encountered {{because of its}} habitat preferences, but its very long tail spine demands extreme caution be exercised in handling it. It {{has been responsible for}} two known fatalities: a worker on a tuna longliner who was impaled by a captured ray, and another fishery worker who succumbed to tetanus days after being stung. This species has been kept in public aquariums for almost a century.|$|E
5|$|The {{distribution}} of the <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> extends nearly worldwide in tropical to warm-temperate pelagic waters, between the latitudes of 52°N and 50°S. In the western Atlantic, {{it has been reported}} from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to North Carolina, the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the Lesser Antilles, Brazil and Uruguay. In the eastern Atlantic, this species has been recorded from the North Sea to Madeira, including the Mediterranean Sea, as well as around Cape Verde, in the Gulf of Guinea and off South Africa. In the Pacific, it is known from Japan to Australia and New Zealand in the west, British Columbia to Chile in the west, and around many oceanic islands including Hawaii, the Galápagos, and Easter Island. There have been no reports of this species from much of the Indian Ocean, but it is known to be common in the southwestern portion and around Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Virtually {{every type}} of medium to large-sized oceanic animal sharing the habitat of the cookiecutter shark is open to attack: bite scars have been found on {{cetaceans}} (including porpoises, dolphins, beaked whales, sperm whales, and baleen whales), pinnipeds (including fur seals, leopard seals, and elephant seals), dugongs, sharks (including blue sharks, goblin sharks, basking sharks, great white sharks, megamouth sharks and smalltooth sand tiger sharks), stingrays (including deepwater <b>stingrays,</b> <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingrays</b> and sixgill stingrays), and bony fishes (including billfishes, tunas, dolphinfishes, jacks, escolars, opahs, and pomfrets). The cookiecutter shark also regularly hunts and eats entire squid with a mantle length of , comparable in size to the shark itself, as well as bristlemouths, copepods, and other prey of more modest dimensions.|$|R
500|$|Holding , the wing's Open Sea {{community}} {{exhibit is}} the aquarium's largest tank. Made out of fiberglass-reinforced plastic, it is [...] long and [...] deep. While the Open Sea community exhibit contains hammerhead sharks, <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingrays,</b> and green sea turtles, {{it is known}} for housing species unique to North American public aquariums such as bluefin and yellowfin tunas, schooling Pacific sardines, and the ocean sunfish. Six great white sharks were displayed in the Open Sea exhibit between 2004–2011, an effort contested by some but generally described as having a positive scientific and educational impact. Prior to the display of the first white shark for six months before its release, the longest length of time that a white shark survived in an aquarium was 16 days.|$|R

5|$|The <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> is {{an active}} {{predator}} that captures prey by wrapping its pectoral fins around it, before manipulating it to the mouth. It is the only stingray in which both sexes have pointed teeth, for grasping and cutting into slippery prey. A wide variety of organisms are represented in its diet: crustaceans including amphipods, krill, and larval crabs, molluscs including squid, octopus, and pteropods, bony fishes including herring, mackerel, sea horses and filefish, comb jellies and medusae, and polychaete worms. Off California, pelagic stingrays hunt large mating aggregations of squid that form from November to April. Off Brazil, this species follows groups of Atlantic cutlassfish (Trichiurus lepturus) towards the coast in January and February, with both predators seeking small schooling fishes. Juvenile rays consume 67% of their body weight in food per day, which declines to just above 1% in adults.|$|E
5|$|Vision {{seems to}} be more {{important}} to the pelagic ray in finding food than in other stingrays. Compared to other members of its family, this species has less than one-third the density of electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini on its underside. The ampullae also cover a smaller area, though not as small as in eagle rays, and are more evenly distributed between the ventral and dorsal surfaces. This ray can detect an electric field of well under 1 nV/cm at a distance of up to , and may be able to pick up the minute electric fields produced by moving sea water. The lateral line of the <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray,</b> a complex system of mechanoreceptors that detect nearby movement and ocean currents, remains similar to other stingrays in covering a greater area on the ventral than the dorsal surface. However, this species is less responsive to mechanical than to visual stimuli.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> {{has a very}} thick, distinctively {{wedge-shaped}} {{pectoral fin}} disc one-third wider than long, with broadly curved leading margins, rather angular outer corners, and nearly straight trailing margins. The snout is short with a rounded tip. The eyes are minute and, unlike in other stingrays, do not protrude above the body; the spiracles (paired respiratory openings) follow immediate behind. There is a short but broad curtain of skin between the nostrils, with a weakly fringed rear margin. The mouth is small and gently arched, with deep furrows at the corners and a tiny projection {{at the center of}} the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw. There are anywhere from 0 to 15 forked papillae (nipple-like structures) in a row across the floor of the mouth. There are 2534 upper tooth rows and 2531 lower tooth rows; the teeth of both sexes have single, pointed cusps, but those of adult males are longer and sharper than those of adult females. The margins of the pelvic fins are nearly straight in front and become rounded at the tips and in back.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Pelagic</b> <b>stingrays,</b> Dasyatis violacea, were {{collected}} in southern California in summer–autumn 1994 – 97. The smallest, 40 – 45 cm disc width (DW) and 2 kg, were estimated to approach age two. In captive growth and feeding experiments from March 1995 to August 2000, the largest male reached 68 cm DW and 12 kg at estimated age 7 years, and the largest female reached 96 cm DW and 49 kg at estimated age 9 years. The growth data could be fitted with both Gompertz and von Bertalanffy growth functions, but the former produced more reasonable values for size at birth, maximum size, and longevity. Consumption of squid was 6 – 7 % of body mass (BM) per day for juveniles 2 years old and decreased to 1. 25 % BM day– 1 for adults. Food intake for adults was seasonal, with 2 cycles per year with a maximum of ~ 2. 0 % and a minimum of 1. 0 – 0. 5 % BM day– 1 from July to October 1998. The data for gross conversion efficiency (K 1, based on energy values), collected at 20 oC with daily feeding to satiation, could be fitted with a linear regression in the estimated mean age range of 3 – 6 years (K 1 = 0. 37 – 0. 055 Age) ...|$|R
25|$|Stingrays {{are common}} in coastal {{tropical}} and subtropical marine waters throughout the world. Some species, such as Dasyatis thetidis, are found in warmer temperate oceans, and others, such as Plesiobatis daviesi, {{are found in the}} deep ocean. The river stingrays, and a number of whiptail stingrays (such as the Niger stingray), are restricted to fresh water. Most myliobatoids are demersal (inhabiting the next-to-lowest zone in the water column), but some, such as the <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> and the eagle rays, are pelagic.|$|E
500|$|In {{adopting}} a midwater lifestyle, the <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> exhibits several characteristics {{different from those}} of its bottom-dwelling relatives. While most stingrays propel themselves by undulating their disc margins, this species swims by oscillating (flapping) its pectoral fins in a manner approaching the [...] "underwater flying" [...] employed by eagle rays. Oscillatory fin motions generate lift, thus improving cruising efficiency in open water at a cost to maneuverability. The <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> is adept at swimming backwards, which may compensate for the lower fine control offered by its swimming mode.|$|E
500|$|The {{meat and}} {{cartilage}} of the <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> are sometimes utilized, {{for example in}} Indonesia, {{but for the most}} part this species is considered worthless and discarded when caught. Susceptible to longlines, gillnets, purse seines, and bottom trawls, it is captured incidentally in large numbers throughout its range. Rays caught on longlines suffer high mortality, as fishers are wary of being stung and remove the rays from the hooks by smashing them against the side of the boat, causing severe damage to the mouth and jaws. The extent of this bycatch has yet to be quantified. Regardless, surveys in the Pacific suggest that <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> numbers have increased since the 1950s, possibly due to commercial fisheries depleting the dominant predators in the ecosystem, such as sharks and tuna. The lack of population declines, coupled with its wide distribution and high reproductive rate, has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to list this species under Least Concern. Recent research has been conducted into reducing <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> bycatch on longlines by switching to larger and/or [...] "C"-shaped hooks.|$|E
500|$|The <b>pelagic</b> <b>{{stingray}}</b> (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) is {{a species}} of stingray in the family Dasyatidae, and the sole member of its genus.

500|$|The <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> {{performs}} seasonal migrations following {{warm water}} masses. In the northwestern Atlantic, {{it is found}} {{in or near the}} Gulf Stream from December to April, and moves north of the Stream to gather near the continental shelf from July to September. A similar migration seems to occur in the Mediterranean, though the specifics are unknown. In the Pacific, this species apparently spends the winter in oceanic waters near the equator and move into higher latitudes and towards the coast in spring. Two Pacific populations are known: one migrates from near Central America to California, and the other from the central Pacific to as far as Japan and British Columbia. Off southeastern Brazil, pelagic stingrays are displaced towards the coast by upwellings of cold water in late spring and summer; in some years they may even be pushed into inshore waters less than [...] deep.|$|E
500|$|Like other stingrays, the <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> is aplacental viviparous: the {{developing}} embryos are at first nourished by yolk, which is later supplanted by histotroph ("uterine milk", containing proteins, lipids, and mucus); the mother delivers the histotroph through numerous thread-like {{extensions of the}} uterine epithelium called [...] "trophonemata", which feed into the enlarged spiracles of the embryo. Females have only one functional ovary and uterus, on the left, and may produce two litters per year. Mating occurs from March to June in the northwestern Atlantic, and in late spring in the southwestern Atlantic. Females are capable of storing sperm internally {{for more than a}} year, allowing them to wait for favorable environmental conditions in which to gestate their young. When first passed into the uterus, a batch of fertilized eggs are contained in a single membraneous capsule tapered at both ends. Shortly after, the capsule ruptures to release the eggs, and is expelled from the uterus. The gestation period may be the shortest of any shark or ray, lasting only 24 months, during which time the embryos increase a hundredfold in mass.|$|E
500|$|The whip-like tail {{measures}} up {{to twice}} as long as the disc; it is thick at the base and tapers significantly to the extremely long, serrated spine placed approximately one-third to halfway along its length. Two spines may be present if a replacement grows in before the original drops off. Posterior to the spine origin, there is a low ventral fin fold that does not reach to the spine tip. Young rays are completely smooth-skinned; with age small prickles appear over the center of the back, as well as a row of small thorns along the midline from between the eyes to the origin of the spine. This species is a plain dark purple to blue-green above, extending onto the tail fold, and a slightly lighter shade below. When captured and handled, it exudes a thick black mucus that covers its body. The <b>pelagic</b> <b>stingray</b> typically grows to [...] long and [...] across. The largest individuals on record are from a captive rearing experiment conducted from 1995 to 2000, in which a male reached [...] across and , and a female [...] across and [...]|$|E
