The number of parcels that pass through the chamber determines the media volume. The rate of revolution or reciprocation determines the flow rate.

50|$|A common {{flow meter}} (like a {{differential}} pressure and <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters)</b> is the magnetic flow meter, also technically an electromagnetic flow meter or more commonly just called a mag meter.

50|$|A <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> meter {{is a type}} of <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> that {{requires}} fluid to mechanically displace components in the meter in order for <b>flow</b> measurement. <b>Positive</b> <b>displacement</b> (PD) <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> measure the volumetric flow rate of a moving fluid or gas by dividing the media into fixed, metered volumes (finite increments or volumes of the fluid). A basic analogy would be holding a bucket below a tap, filling it to a set level, then quickly replacing it with another bucket and timing {{the rate at which the}} buckets are filled (or the total number of buckets for the “totalized” flow). With appropriate pressure and temperature compensation, the mass flow rate can be accurately determined.|$|R
40|$|In this study, we have {{examined}} the convective flow boiling performance of R- 134 a on various micro-structured aluminum surfaces produced using advanced manufacturing techniques. More specifically, we have calculated the boiling heat transfer coefficient of R- 134 a on a bare aluminum surface and three micro-structurally enhanced surfaces. Two of these surfaces were produced using photolithography and reactive ion etching techniques, and the third surface was produced by means of laser-ablation. Experiments were performed in a conventional two-phase, single-pass loop which allowed for heat transfer and pressure drop measurements over a range of inlet qualities with only small quality changes occurring in the test section. There was also optical access to the test specimen to permit flow visualization. To begin, both single-phase and two-phase flow experiments were performed on the bare aluminum surface to compare these baseline results with data found in the literature. Once baseline testing and validation were complete, the sample was exchanged and the three micro-structured surfaces were then each subsequently tested. The temperature and pressure of the refrigerant were measured at stations in the flow upstream and downstream of the test section, and {{the temperature of the}} test surface was measured using five T-type thermocouples in contact with the sample. The evaporation of the refrigerant was driven by thin ceramic heaters in contact with the underside of the test samples. The pressure, temperature, and quality within the test section were prescribed using an upstream heat exchanger, and the mass flow rate of the refrigerant was controlled using a magnetic gear pump and measured using a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter.</b> Experiments were performed for mass fluxes between 75 and 600 kg/m 2 s and for heat fluxes between 5 and 25 kW/m 2...|$|R
50|$|Some designs {{require that}} only {{lubricating}} fluid be measured, because the rotors {{are exposed to}} the fluid. PD meters differ from turbine meters in that they handle medium and high-viscosity liquids well. For this reason, they are often used to measure the flow of hydraulic fluids. Compared with orifice-type meters, PD meters require very little straight upstream piping since they are not sensitive to uneven flow distribution across the area of the pipe. <b>Positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> can provide better relative accuracy at low flows than orifice-type flow meters. However, a positive displacement meter can be considerably heavier and more costly than non-positive-displacement types such as orifice plates, magnetic or vortex flow meters.|$|E

Flow rate is the volume of a fluid or mass of a substance which passes through a surface per time unit. Conversion can be made between volumetric and mass flow rate if the gas density is known. A market survey showed that Coriolis and thermal mass <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> and <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> (volumetric) <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> as the Reciflow, {{are the most common}} kinds. The Reciflow consist of a system-on-board and a displacement meter with an optical encoder. The displacement meter is a cylinder with a piston within and valves at the ends. The firmware controls the valves so that the piston can reciprocate. The components of the Reciflow affects the accuracy and it is estimated to ± 0; 025 % for non-normalized and ± 0; 2 %for normalized flow. It is measured under normal conditions to be ± 0; 2 %normalized, relative to a reference. Further experiments must be performed to verify the accuracy and also the precision. The actual measurement of flow rate and volume is made with the encoder: as a difference in time between signal edges and the total number of edges accounted for. Data with random noise is filtered with moving average filters and heuristic methods is used to handle static noise. Serial communication has been implemented for on- and off-board uses.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{theoretical}} analysis of the internal lobe pump which is a particular type of <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> rotary pump. The main components of the pump are the rotors: usually the outer one is characterised by lobes with circular shape, while the inner rotor profile is determined as conjugate to the other. For this reason the first topic presented here is the definition of the geometry of the rotors starting from the design parameters. The choice of these parameters is subject to some limitations in order to avoid inner rotor undercutting and to limit the pressure angle between the rotors. Now we will consider the design optimisation. The first step is the determination of the instantaneous flow rate in function of the design parameters. This allows us to calculate two performance indexes commonly used for the study of <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps: the <b>flow</b> rate irregularity and the specific flow rate. These indexes are used to optimise the design of the pump and to obtain the sets of optimum design parameters. Finally further considerations are presented regarding the calculation and the use of other performance indexes, the specific slipping and the rotor curvature, which are particularly suitable for giving more elements for the analysis of this case...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the precision and accuracy of <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> used in hospital settings. METHODS: An experimental study was performed to test oxygen <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> from a tertiary hospital, by using a calibrated flow analyzer. Used and new <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> accuracy was tested by reading in the gas analyzer a single measurement at flow rates of 1, 3, 5, and 10 L/min in 91 <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> and they were compared using the Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test. <b>Flow</b> <b>meter</b> precision was tested by reading in the flow analyzer 3 repetitive measurements set at flow rates of 1, 3, 5, and 10 L/min in 11 <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> and the reproducibility of these measurements was conducted by using the intraclass correlation coefficient and the Friedman test. RESULTS: the mean measured flow rates were slightly lower than the stipulated flow rate at 1 L/min, very close for 3 L/min, and higher for the 5 and 10 L/min flow rates. There was a large variability among the measurements from different <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> mainly at low flow rates (1 and 3 L/min).
