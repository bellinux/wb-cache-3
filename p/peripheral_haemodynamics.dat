40|$|The {{effect of}} {{felodipine}} 10 mg oral solution or placebo on <b>peripheral</b> <b>haemodynamics</b> {{and the response}} of the forearm resistance vessels to venous occlusion was studied in seven normotensive individuals. Felodipine produced a significant fall in diastolic blood pressure (DBP max = - 15 mm Hg), a rise in heart rate (heart rate max = + 15 beats min- 1) (both P less than 0. 01), and an overall fall in calculated forearm vascular resistance (calculated forearm vascular resistance max = - 19. 6 units, P less than 0. 001). Felodipine had no significant effect on the vasodilator response, but limited the vasoconstrictor response following venous occlusion. These observations suggest that felodipine is a potent vasodilator and interferes with the myogenic response of vascular smooth muscle of the forearm resistance vessels...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{ventricular}} {{rate that}} occur normally are predominantly autonomically directed and {{form part of}} a co-ordinated pattern of autonomic effects evoked by physiological stimuli and directed to the heart and peripheral beds. In contrast, the changes in ventricular rate that occur with arrhythmias {{are not part of}} a co-ordinated autonomic response, but themselves initiate changes in cardiac function and arterial pressure which in turn evoke autonomic and local effects inappropriate for physiological needs. Figure 1 shows just how large and dramatic these changes can be, particularly in relation to the coronary circulation, where alternating bouts of tachy- and bradyarrhythmia elicit marked fluctuations in coronary blood flow and resistance. Such changes are of considerable interest in view of their potential influence on organ function in diseased circulations, e. g. in the heart and kidney. For this reason, we have examined the pattern of <b>peripheral</b> <b>haemodynamics</b> that occurs at different ventricular rates. The experiments were carried out in conscious dogs with experimentally induced heart block and with pacemaker leads sutured to the right ventricle. Ventricular rate was varied using a pacemaker unit...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} whether {{a combination of}} supervised exercise training and ginkgo biloba treatment is a better treatment than exercise training alone for patients with peripheral arterial disease. Design: A 24 -week double-blind, placebo-controlled ginkgo biloba trial with the first 12 -week period as a non-exercise control stage and the second 12 -week period as an exercise training stage. Setting: Exercise physiology laboratory. Subjects: Twenty-two subjects with peripheral arterial disease. Interventions: The subjects were randomly allocated into a ginkgo or a placebo group. During the first stage, the ginkgo group ingested standardized ginkgo biloba tablets with a daily dosage of 240 mg, while the placebo group received placebo tablets. During the second stage, all subjects engaged in a supervised treadmill-walking programme while continuing to take the same dosage of ginkgo biloba or placebo tablets. Main measures: Walking capacity on treadmill, oxygen consumption during exercise, <b>peripheral</b> <b>haemodynamics</b> and blood viscosity were measured at baseline, and after {{the first and the}} second stages of treatment. Results: The ginkgo group did not show significant changes in most of the measured variables after each stage of treatment, except that the maximal walking time was significantly increased after the combined treatment (from 236 ± 112 seconds to 557 ± 130 seconds, P < 0. 001). However, similar response was also found in the placebo group after exercise training (from 384 ± 125 seconds to 820 ± 146 seconds, P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Supervised exercise training combined with ginkgo biloba treatment did not produce greater beneficial effects than exercise training alone in patients with peripheral arterial disease...|$|E
40|$|NEW FINDINGS: What is {{the central}} {{question}} of this study? Left ventricular (LV) twist is reduced when afterload is increased, but {{the meaning of this}} specific heart muscle response and its impact on cardiac output are not well understood. What is the main finding and its importance? This study shows that LV twist responds even when arterial haemodynamics are altered only locally, and without apparent change in metabolic (i. e. heat-induced) demand. The concurrent decline in cardiac output and LV twist during partial arterial occlusion despite the increased peripheral demand caused by heat stress suggests that LV twist may be involved in the protective sensing of heart muscle stress that can override the provision of the required cardiac output. Whether left ventricular (LV) twist and untwisting rate (LV twist mechanics) respond to localised, peripheral, non-metabolic changes in arterial haemodynamics within an individual's normal afterload range is presently unknown. Furthermore, previous studies indicate that LV twist mechanics may override the provision of cardiac output, but this hypothesis has not been examined purposefully. Therefore, we acutely altered local <b>peripheral</b> arterial <b>haemodynamics</b> in 11 healthy humans (women/men n = 3 / 8; age 26 ± 5 years) by bilateral arm heating (BAH). Ultrasonography was used to examine arterial haemodynamics, LV twist mechanics and the twist-to-shortening ratio (TSR). To determine the arterial function-dependent contribution of LV twist mechanics to cardiac output, partial blood flow restriction to the arms was applied during BAH (BAHBFR). Bilateral arm heating increased arm skin temperatures [change (Δ) + 6. 4 ± 0. 9 °C, P 0. 05), concomitant to increases in brachial artery blood flow (Δ 212 ± 77 ml, P 0. 05). Subsequently, BAHBFR reduced all parameters to preheating levels, except for TSR and heart rate, which remained at BAH levels. In conclusion, LV twist mechanics responded to local <b>peripheral</b> arterial <b>haemodynamics</b> within the normal afterload range, in part independent of TSR and heart rate. The findings suggest that LV twist mechanics may be more closely associated with intrinsic sensing of excessive pressure stress rather than being associated with the delivery of adequate cardiac output...|$|R
40|$|Central and <b>peripheral</b> post-exercise <b>haemodynamics</b> {{were studied}} in 18 {{physically}} trained male subjects (10 hypertensive and eight normotensive) engaging in sports activities for 3 - 5 h/week. After a preliminary multistage bicycle ergometric test {{to evaluate their}} maximal oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold, they underwent prolonged exercise at anaerobic threshold in the semi-supine position at 30 % grade until exhaustion (mean duration 60. 0 +/- 16. 7 min in the normotensive subjects and 61. 0 +/- 5. 7 min in the hypertensive subjects, not significant). During the recovery time, intra-arterial blood pressure, echocardiographic cardiac output and indium-gallium strain-gauge plethysmographic peripheral flow were measured, and total, forearm and leg peripheral resistances were calculated respectively from mean blood pressure/cardiac output and mean blood pressure/peripheral resistance. 2. Systolic blood pressure was decreased during the entire recovery period {{in comparison with the}} baseline values (- 8. 4 mmHg, - 43. 8 mmHg and - 39. 7 mmHg at the 1 st, 5 th and 10 th min in the hypertensive subjects, P = 0. 001, P = 0. 0001 and P = 0. 0001 respectively; - 18. 8, - 25. 5 and - 24. 1 mmHg in the normotensive subjects, not significant, P = 0. 01 and P = 0. 01, respectively) without any significant difference between the two groups, whereas the reduction in diastolic blood pressure was not statistically significant. Peripheral flow increased and peripheral resistance decreased in parallel in the forearm and the leg and showed similar trends in the hypertensive subjects and the normotensive subjects. The increase in cardiac output and left ventricular ejection fraction and the decrease in total resistance were also similar in the two group...|$|R
40|$|Objectives:To {{study the}} {{efficacy}} of hypertonic fluid therapy on central haemodynamics, leg blood flow, and skeletal muscle metabolism at reperfusion after subtotal bilateral limb ischaemia. Design:Prospective, randomised, controlled study, in pigs (n = 24). Methods:Bilateral limb ischaemia was induced (aortic balloon catheter) and central <b>haemodynamics,</b> <b>peripheral</b> blood flow, thoracic fluid content, blood chemistry, and skeletal muscle metabolite levels were monitored. After 235 min of ischaemia infusion of normal 0. 9 % saline (NS), hypertonic 7. 5 % saline (HS), or HS in 6 % dextran 70 (HSD) was started. Five minutes later the aortic balloon was deflated and the haemodynamic and metabolic alterations were studied for 180 min after reflow. Results:Aortic occlusion resulted in haemodynamic alterations, reduced limb perfusion and metabolic changes indicative of tissue ischaemia. The haemodynamic support prior to, and following, deflation of the aortic balloon was more efficient for HS and HSD than for NS. Lactate clearance and restitution of high energy phosphagen levels in skeletal muscle were faster and more pronounced in the HS and HSD groups. Conclusions:Small-volume hypertonic saline, especially in combination with 6 %-dextran 70, will effectively reverse limb ischaemia-induced haemodynamic and tissue metabolic disturbances...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} the oxygen-conserving {{potential of the}} human diving response by comparing trained breath-hold divers (BHDs) to non-divers (NDs) during simulated dynamic breath-holding (BH). Changes in haemodynamics [heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) ] and peripheral muscle oxygenation [oxyhaemoglobin ([HbO 2]), deoxyhaemoglobin ([HHb]), total haemoglobin ([tHb]), tissue saturation index (TSI) ] and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2) were continuously recorded during simulated dynamic BH. BHDs showed a breaking point in HR kinetics at mid-BH immediately preceding a more pronounced drop in HR (− 0. 86 bpm. %− 1) while HR kinetics in NDs steadily decreased throughout BH (− 0. 47 bpm. %− 1). By contrast, SV remained unchanged during BH in both groups (all P > 0. 05). Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) results (mean ± SD) expressed as percentage changes from the initial values showed a lower [HHb] increase for BHDs than for NDs at the cessation of BH (+ 24. 0 ± 10. 1 vs. + 39. 2 ± 9. 6 %, respectively; P < 0. 05). As a result, BHDs showed a [tHb] drop that NDs did not {{at the end of}} BH (− 7. 3 ± 3. 2 vs. − 3. 0 ± 4. 7 %, respectively; P < 0. 05). The most striking finding {{of the present study was}} that BHDs presented an increase in oxygen-conserving efficiency due to substantial shifts in both cardiac and <b>peripheral</b> <b>haemodynamics</b> during simulated BH. In addition, the kinetic-based approach we used provides further credence to the concept of an “oxygen-conserving breaking point” in the human diving response...|$|E
40|$|Rationale -Evidence {{suggests}} {{interactive effects}} of the tea components caffeine and L-theanine on behaviour, yet no data exists exploring {{the impact of the}} two on cerebral blood flow (CBF). Objectives - The current placebo-controlled, double-blind, counterbalanced, crossover study examined the effects of caffeine and L-theanine on CBF and extended previous cognitive and mood findings by using lower doses than previous studies of a similar methodology, which more closely reflect the ratios present in tea. Methods - Twelve habitual consumers and 12 non-habitual consumers of caffeine each received 75 mg caffeine, 50 mg L-theanine, 75 mg caffeine plus 50 mg L-theanine, and placebo in a counterbalanced order across four separate visits. CBF was measured via near-infrared spectroscopy with cognition and mood assessed at baseline and 30 min post-dose. Salivary caffeine and <b>peripheral</b> <b>haemodynamics</b> were co-monitored. Results - Caffeine reduced oxygenated haemoglobin (oxy-Hb), increased deoxygenated haemoglobin (deoxy-Hb), improved performance on attention tasks and increased overall mood ratings. Increases in deoxy-Hb following caffeine were more pronounced in non-consumers. Some evidence for increased deoxy-Hb remained when caffeine was combined with L-theanine, but this effect was attenuated and the effects of caffeine on oxy-Hb, cognition and mood were eradicated. Conclusions - Combining L-theanine with caffeine, at levels and ratios equivalent to one to two cups of tea, eliminated the vasoconstrictive effect and behavioural effects of caffeine. This supports previous findings of an interaction between these substances, despite a lack of effects of L-theanine in isolation. However, at the levels tested here, this did not lead to a positive impact on behaviour...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: {{intermittent}} pneumatic compression (IPC) of {{the foot}} (IPCfoot), calf (IPCcalf) or both (IPCfoot+calf) augments calf inflow, and improves the walking ability and <b>peripheral</b> <b>haemodynamics</b> of claudicants (IPCfoot, IPCfoot+calf), largely due to venous outflow enhancement. This cohort study, using direct pressure measurements in healthy limbs, determines the optimal combination of frequency (2 – 4 impulses/minute), applied pressure (60 – 140 mmHg), mode (IPCfoot–IPCcalf–IPCfoot+calf) and delay time of calf-to-foot impulse (0 s– 0. 5 s– 1 s) that enables IPC to generate an almost complete and sustained decrease in venous pressure. Results : (a) IPCfootat 120 and 80 mmHg generated lower venous pressure than that with 100 and 60 mmHg (p= 0. 036) respectively, for 2 – 4 impulses/minute; venous pressure differences between applied pressures of 140 and 120 mmHg or between 80 and 100 mmHg were insignificant. (b) Venous pressure with IPCcalfat 80 mmHg was lower than that with 60 mmHg (p= 0. 036) (2 – 4 cycles/minute); differences in venous pressure between applied pressures of 140 and 100 mmHg or between 120 and 80 mmHg were insignificant. (c) At applied pressures 60 – 140 mmHg, IPCfoot+calfwith one-second delay generated lower venous pressure than that with half-second delay (p= 0. 036), the latter being more efficient than zero delay; increasing applied pressures produced lower venous pressure, but differences were small. Venous pressure decreased with increasing IPC frequency (from 2 to 3 – 4 /minute), at applied pressures 60 – 140 mmHg. Conclusions: IPCfoot+calfat applied 120 – 140 mmHg, a frequency of 3 – 4 impulses/minute and one-second delay, provided the optimum intermittent pneumatic stimulus...|$|E
40|$|Rationale Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) is a progressive lung condition with extrapulmonary manifestations- cardiovascular diseases (CVD), impaired physical function, activity and increased frailty. Integrating measures of function into community assessments is hindered by {{the space and}} time required. The association of function, activity and CVD has not been extensively investigated in COPD. Objectives Explore the potential utility of Time Up and Go (TUG) {{as a measure of}} physical function in COPD Assess association of non-invasive measures of haemodynamics to physical function and self-reported activity Explore ambulatory haemodynamics in COPD and controls Methods Subjects with COPD (n= 119) and controls (n= 58) were recruited. Ethical and governance approvals were obtained. A medical history including falls, spirometry, <b>peripheral</b> and central <b>haemodynamics,</b> self-reported physical activity questionnaires and functional assessments (TUG and six-minute walk distance (6 MWD)) were obtained from all subjects. Ambulatory 24 -hour haemodynamics including aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) and blood pressure were measured in patients (n= 20) and controls (n= 19). Results TUG mean(SD) was increased in patients 11. 9 (3. 7) s compared to controls 9. 5 (1. 8) s, p 0. 05. In the pilot study, significant nocturnal dip in aPWV was seen in controls, p< 0. 01, but not in patients, p= 0. 07. Conclusion TUG could be a useful measure of function and possibly be incorporated into COPD assessment, particularly where time and space are limited. Finally, ambulatory haemodynamic machine, the Mobil-O-Graph, is feasible and offers opportunity to assess 24 -hour haemodynamics profile including aPWV as opposed to a one-off measurement...|$|R
40|$|Aims Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a thiol {{compound}} with antioxidant properties used in {{the treatment}} of diabetic polyneuropathy. ALA may also improve arterial function, but there have been scant human trials examining this notion. This project aimed to investigate the effects of oral and intra-arterial ALA on changes in systemic and regional haemodynamics, respectively. Methods In study 1, 16 healthy older men aged 58 +/- 7 years (mean +/- SD) received 600 mg of ALA or placebo, on two occasions 1 week apart, in a randomized cross-over design. Repeated measures of <b>peripheral</b> and central <b>haemodynamics</b> were then obtained for 90 min. Central blood pressure and indices of arterial stiffness [augmentation index (AIx) and estimated aortic pulse wave velocity] were recorded non-invasively using pulse wave analysis. Blood samples obtained pre- and post-treatments were analysed for erythrocyte antioxidant enzyme activity, plasma nitrite and malondialdehyde. In study 2 the effects of incremental cumulative doses (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 mg ml(- 1) min(- 1)) of intra-arterial ALA on forearm blood flow (FBF) were assessed in eight healthy subjects (aged 31 +/- 5 years) by conventional venous occlusion plethysmography. Results There were no significant changes on any of the central or peripheral haemodynamic measures after either oral or direct arterial administration of ALA. Plasma ALA was detected after oral supplementation (95 % confidence intervals 463, 761 ng ml(- 1)), but did not alter cellular or plasma measures of oxidative stress. Conclusions Neither oral nor intra-arterial ALA had any effect on regional and systemic haemodynamics or measures of oxidative stress in healthy men...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the ability of Doppler ultrasound to detect changes in femoral blood flow during pharmacologic manipulation of arterial blood pressure. Doppler ultrasonography was performed in the femoral vessels of six halothane-anesthetized horses before and during administration of phenylephrine HCI and sodium nitroprusside. The time-averaged mean velocity and volumetric flow were calculated. The contour of the velocity waveform was assessed, and the early diastolic deceleration slope (EDDS) and pulsatility index (PI) were calculated. Administration of phenylephrine HCI resulted in increased mean aortic blood pressure (MABP) by 40 % (29. 3 - 53. 0 %). This caused significant decrease in cardiac output (26. 8 to 13. 5 l/min), femoral arterial velocity (left artery 7. 20 to 4. 00 cm/s; right artery 5. 01 to 3. 39 cm/s) and volumetric flow (left artery 556 to 221 ml/min; right artery 397 to 193 ml/min) in the femoral vessels and significant increase in systemic vascular resistance (163 to 433 dyn-s/cm 5), EDDS (1 a: 285 to 468 : ra: 250 to 481) and PI (1 a: 9. 38 to 20. 4; ra 17. 1 to 29. 1). Administration of sodium nitroprusside resulted in a decreased MABP of 27. 2 % (22. 5 - 33 %). This increased cardiac output (20. 8 to 32. 4 L/min), however, no significant changes were observed in femoral blood flow. Despite obvious changes in the waveform contour, no significant change occurred in EDDS or PI. These results suggest that Doppler ultrasound may be useful for measuring femoral blood flow in anesthetized horses. However, waveform analysis appears to be limited when multiple changes occur in central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>haemodynamics.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to analyse the relationship between arterial hypertension and changes in arterial blood flow and vascular wall damage of the lower limbs in hypertensive patients with various degrees of hypertension. Six hundred and fifty-four hypertensive patients (421 males and 233 females) aged 35 to 70 years and 88 healthy subjects (63 males and 25 females) aged 39 to 60 years were studied. Strain-gauge plethysmography of the lower limbs was used to calculate arterial calf blood flow (RF), arterial calf blood flow after post-ischaemic hyperaemia (PF), basal and minimal vascular resistances (BVR and MVR), time to reach peak flow (tPF), time until 50 % reduction of peak flow (tT 1 / 2) and total recovery time (tT). In 108 (67 males and 41 females) of the hypertensive patients, a morphological study by echo-Doppler duplex scanning of the popliteal artery was performed to measure medial-intimal thickening and popliteal lumen diameter. Our results indicate that regional haemodynamics of the lower limbs worsened in hypertensives in comparison with control subjects. In addition, the change in <b>peripheral</b> <b>haemodynamics</b> was related to the degree of hypertension. Moreover, medial [...] intimal thickening was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher in severe hypertensives than mild hypertensives. Popliteal lumen diameter was significantly (P < 0. 05) lower in severe hypertensives than moderate and mild hypertensives. In all these subjects mean blood pressure was correlated directly (r = 0. 31; P < 0. 001) with medial-intimal thickening and inversely (r = - 0. 37; P < 0. 001) with popliteal lumen diameter. Multiple regression analysis indicated that mean blood pressure, age and serum cholesterol were independently correlated to medial-intimal thickening. This relationship was not influenced by the diabetic patients and smokers among the groups. Our results indicate that hypertension impairs peripheral flow and encourages the development of medial-intimal thickening...|$|E
