5000|$|As the [...] Royal Arms go hand-in-hand {{with the}} crown, the {{undifferentiated}} Royal Arms passed to George VI. It {{was and is}} common heraldic practice for the eldest son to differentiate his [...] arms in his father's lifetime, but the Duke of Windsor {{was left in the}} unusual position of an eldest son needing to difference his arms after his father's death. This was done by means of a label argent of three <b>points,</b> <b>bearing</b> on the middle point an imperial crown proper.|$|R

50|$|Distinctive {{black leather}} hats for the fiesta are worn by some male {{participants}} during the ceremonies and the parade. The San Juan hats have greatly exaggerated, stiff and circular flat brims that extend over {{the shoulders and}} crowns that are high, square, and <b>pointed,</b> <b>bearing</b> many types of symbols. Perhaps intentionally, the design also serves to protect wearers from the rocks. Sometimes intervention by police is required if the participants become too rowdy. In the last years {{the safety of the}} participants and onlookers greatly improved, due to the careful scheduling and monitoring of the arrival of dancers from different communities to town.|$|R

25|$|The Northern Archaic Tradition flourished 6,000–1,000 years ago. Site density {{increased}} {{again after}} about 6,000 {{years ago in}} Interior Alaska. This population increase coincides roughly with the Northern Archaic Tradition {{and the appearance of}} side-notched projectile points. Douglas D. Anderson originally defined the Northern Archaic Tradition to specifically address notched <b>point</b> <b>bearing</b> stratigraphic horizons that did not contain microblades at the Onion Portage site (Onion Portage Archeological District of Kobuk Malimiut tribes of Inupiat people region) in northern Alaska. Notched point assemblages occur in many sites in Interior Alaska, including over one dozen on Army's Fort Wainwright lands. Several sites, including the excavated Banjo Lake site in Donnelly Training Area, have also produced middle Holocene dates from hearth charcoal. The 6,300- to 6,700-year-old dates from Banjo Lake were also associated with a microblade component.|$|E
