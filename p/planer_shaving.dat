40|$|This study, has {{investigated}} effect of using graphite powder on thermal conductivity {{during the time}} of production in three-layer boards made ​​of <b>planer</b> <b>shaving</b> particles (70 % in the middle layer) and the particles poplar (30 % of the surface) at 4 levels of 0, 5, 10 and 15 % (oven dry adhesive). After that physical properties and mechanical strength measured. Overall, results have shown that use of graphite powder, increases amount of thermal conductivity significantly. Also found that modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity had significantly increased and the thickness swelling and water absorption decreased, but they had no significant effect on shear strength parallel to surface. So the boards produced by 15 % graphite powder had maximum amount of modulus of rupture (18. 42 MPa) and modulus of elasticity (2298 MPa) and also had minimum amount of water absorption and thickness swellin...|$|E

50|$|A spill {{plane is}} a device which creates long, {{spiraling}} wood shavings or tapers {{which are used}} to move fire {{from one place to}} another. They were most common in the era before matches were common. They are unique in that ordinarily wood planes are used to shape a piece of wood, whereas with a spill <b>plane</b> the <b>shaving</b> is the product.|$|R
6000|$|In the {{wilderness}} of the railway shops--and machinery that <b>planes</b> and <b>shaves,</b> and bevels and stamps, and punches and hoists and nips--the first idea that occurs to an outsider, {{when he has}} seen the men who people the place, is {{that it must be}} the birthplace of inventions--a pasture-ground of fat patents. If a writing-man, who plays with shadows and dresses dolls that others may laugh at their antics, draws help and comfort and new methods of working old ideas from the stored shelves of a library, how, in the name of Commonsense, his god, can a doing-man, whose mind is set upon things that snatch a few moments from flying Time or put power into weak hands, refrain from going forward and adding new inventions to the hundreds among which he daily moves? ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 End {{scrapers}} were an "all purpose" {{tool that}} {{have been associated with}} processes such as <b>planing</b> or <b>shaving</b> vegetal resources, shaping bone or antler implements, and to render hide into usable fabric. Examining end scrapers from four different archaeological sites on the North Umpqua River of southwestern Oregon provided interesting data regarding the use of these tools over time. Each site consists of at least one, or several, occupational components providing an opportunity to compare similarities and differences between sites. Analyses rely in part on the comparison of multi-dimensional characteristics, or allometry, of the stone tools. Statistically, the relationship between the length of an end scraper and its thickest point has been previously suggested to be demonstrative of the original size of the tool. A similar conclusion was acquired during this analysis, which then sought to determine if a discard ratio for each site could be established based on the length and edge angle of the end scrapers. The discard ratio was originally thought to represent a reflection of functional efficiency, differential resource processing, or material availability. A bulk analysis of material types from the overall assemblages and a comparison of end scraper composition suggested intensive use of obsidian, the non-local material. Overall, trends could not be demonstrated using the discard ratio to represent the degree of use as end scrapers size depends on lithic technology, material availability, and perhaps a specific need. Perhaps the most intriguing outcome of this study relates to the individual Middle Archaic component at the Meg's Keep site. Based on the large obsidian artifact assemblage, this site is thought to have been a task specific location and that the large number of end scrapers recovered were manufactured elsewhere and imported to the site. Comparing end scrapers at each site suggested that Type 1 scraper (≥ 7. 5 mm) may be an indicator of curation. The analyses indicate that Type 1 CCS end scrapers at Canton Creek, Dry Creek, and Boulder Confluence out-numbered Type 3 scrapers 20 to 4. In contrast, the large number of end scrapers at Meg's Keep had a total of 9 Type 1 end scrapers. From the above data, Type 1 and Type 3 end scrapers appear to be {{a direct result of the}} availability of raw material and potentially an indicator of curation...|$|R
