There is an upper {{limit on the}} amount of DNA that can be packed into a phage (a maximum of 53 kb), {{therefore}} to allow foreign DNA to be inserted into phage DNA, <b>phage</b> <b>cloning</b> vectors may need to have some non-essential genes deleted, for example the genes for lysogeny since using phage λ as a cloning vector involves only the lytic cycle. [...] There are two kinds of λ phage vectors - insertion vector and replacement vector. Insertion vectors contain a unique cleavage site whereby foreign DNA with size of 5-11 kb may be inserted. In replacement vectors, the cleavage sites flank a region containing genes not essential for the lytic cycle, and this region may be deleted and replaced by the DNA insert in the cloning process, and a larger sized DNA of 8-24 kb may be inserted.|$|E
40|$|Cloning {{strategies}} {{were developed to}} isolate genomic sequence {{from the site of}} plasmid vector integration of myeloma J 558 L transformants. Two potential approaches were examined. Ligation-mediated anchor PCR was shown to be capable of generating amplification products that included sequence from the integrated plasmid. However, when these were cloned and analysed, they were found to contain various arrangements of primers and plasmid sequence, but no genomic flanking sequence. Further refinement of the procedure failedto generate any products containing flanking sequence. Phage libraries were constructed from transformant genomic DNA. These were screened for clones containing plasmid sequence. A clone was identified, purified and analysed. Although it did contain both plasmid and unknown genomic sequence, its size and arrangement did not tally with information previously gleaned about the integration site and so its significance was hard to establish. Ligation-mediated anchor PCR {{has been shown to be}} a potentially quick and convenient cloning method but one which is extremely technically demanding. It is unclear why it failed in this case to generate useful product. <b>Phage</b> <b>cloning</b> is a more laborious approach which did produce results.

40|$|Abstract Background Identical {{blood samples}} tested using {{different}} kits can give markedly different hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels, {{which can cause}} difficulty {{in the interpretation of}} viral load. A universal double-stranded DNA control or standard {{that can be used in}} all commercial HBV DNA nucleic acid amplification assay kits is urgently needed. By aligning all HBV genotypes (A-H), we found that the surface antigen gene and precore-core gene regions of HBV are the most conserved regions among the different HBV genotypes. We constructed a chimeric fragment by overlapping extension polymerase chain reaction and obtained a 1, 349 -bp HBV C+S fragment. We then packaged the fragment into lambda phages using a traditional lambda <b>phage</b> <b>cloning</b> procedure. Results The obtained armored DNA was resistant to DNase I digestion and was stable, noninfectious to humans, and could be easily extracted using commercial kits. More importantly, the armored DNA may be used with all HBV DNA nucleic acid amplification assay kits. Conclusions The lambda phage packaging system can be used as an excellent expression platform for armored DNA. The obtained armored DNA possessed all characteristics of an excellent positive control or standard. In addition, this armored DNA is likely to be appropriate for all commercial HBV DNA nucleic acid amplification detection kits. Thus, the constructed armored DNA can probably be used as a universal positive control or standard in HBV DNA assays. </p...|$|E

Since tissue culture is highly selective for viral strains with an in vitro growth advantage, such clones may not {{be representative of the}} biologically relevant virus present in vivo. In this study, we report the molecular cloning and genotypic characterization of 10 HIV- 1 genomes directly from uncultured brain tissue of a patient with AIDS dementia complex. Targeting unintegrated circular HIV- 1 molecules for recombinant lambda <b>phage</b> <b>cloning,</b> we obtained four full-length genomes with one or two long terminal repeats (LTRs), three defective genomes with internal deletions, two rearranged genomes with inverted LTR sequences, and one integrated proviral half with flanking cellular sequences.

Comparison of a 510 -bp hypervariable envelope region among 8 lambda phage-derived and 12 polymerase chain reaction-derived clones from the same brain specimen identified a predominant viral form as well as genetically divergent variants.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} multivalent display of peptide and protein sequences typically censored from traditional N-terminal display on protein pIII of filamentous bacteriophage M 13. Using site-directed mutagenesis of commercially available M 13 KE <b>phage</b> <b>cloning</b> vector, we introduced sites that permit efficient cloning using restriction enzymes between domains N 1 and N 2 of the pIII protein. As infectivity of phage is {{directly linked to}} the integrity of the connection between N 1 and N 2 domains, intra-domain phage display (ID-PhD) allows for simple quality control of the display and the natural variations in the displayed sequences. Additionally, direct linkage to phage propagation allows efficient monitoring of sequence cleavage, providing a convenient system for selection and evolution of protease-susceptible or protease-resistant sequences. As an example of the benefits of such an ID-PhD system, we displayed a charged FLAG sequence, which is known to be post-translationally excised from pIII when displayed on the N-terminus. ID-PhD of FLAG exhibited sub-nanomolar apparent Kd suggesting multivalent nature of the display. A TEV-protease recognition sequence (TEVrs) co-expressed in tandem with FLAG, allowed us to demonstrate that 99. 9997 % of the phage displayed the FLAG-TEVrs tandem and can be recognized and cleaved by TEV-protease. The residual 0. 0003 % consisted of phage clones that have excised the insert from their genome. ID-PhD is also amenable to display of protein mini-domains, such as the 33 -residue minimized Z-domain of protein A. We show that it is thus possible to use ID-PhD for multivalent display and selection of mini-domain proteins (Affibodies, scFv, etc.) ...|$|E

Our sequential approach consisted of the following steps: (1) Partial biochemical characterization was used to pinpoint candidate known variants. The identity of these was then verified by restriction-enzyme or allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization analysis of the appropriate PCR-amplified fragment. (2) On samples for {{which there was no}} obvious candidate mutation, we proceeded to amplify the entire coding region in eight fragments, followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of each fragment. (3) The next step was M 13 <b>phage</b> <b>cloning</b> and sequencing of those individual fragments that were found to be abnormal by SSCP. Through this approach we have identified the molecular lesion in 51 of the 53 samples. In these we found a total of nine different G 6 PD-deficient variants, five of which (G 6 PD Mediterranean, G 6 PD A-, G 6 PD Coimbra, G 6 PD Seattle, and G 6 PD Montalbano) were already known, whereas four are new (G 6 PD Cassano, G 6 PD Cosenza, G 6 PD Sibari, and G 6 PD Maewo). G 6 PD Mediterranean is the commonest variant, followed by G 6 PD Seattle. At least seven of the variants are present, at polymorphic frequencies, in the Calabria region, and some have a nonrandom distribution within the region. This study shows that the genetic heterogeneity of G 6 PD deficiency in Calabria, when analyzed at the DNA level, is even greater than had been anticipated from biochemical characterization.

To obtain binders with the desired binding specificity a series of surface and solution phage-display biopannings were performed. Initially, three rounds of surface biopanning against gamma-irradiated L. monocytogenes serovar 4 b cells were performed followed by an additional surface biopanning round against L. monocytogenes 4 b which included prior subtraction biopanning against gamma-irradiated L. innocua cells. In an attempt to further enhance binder specificity for L. monocytogenes 4 b two rounds of solution biopanning were performed, both rounds included initial subtraction solution biopanning against L. innocua.

40|$|Cmd 4 is a colcemid-sensitive CHO {{cell line}} that is {{temperature}} sensitive {{for growth and}} expresses an altered β-tubulin, β 1. One revertant of this cell line, D 2, exhibits a further alteration in β 1 resulting in an acidic shift in its isoelectric point {{and a decrease in}} its molecular weight to 40 kD, as measured by two dimensional gel electrophoresis. This β-tubulin variant {{has been shown to be}} assembly-defective and unstable. Characterization of the mutant β 1 in D 2 by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed the loss of methionine containing tryptic peptides 7, 8, 9, and 10. Southern analysis of the genomic DNA digested with several different restriction enzymes resulted in the appearance of new restriction fragments 250 base pairs shorter than the corresponding fragments from the wild-type β 1 -tubulin gene. Northern analysis on mRNA from D 2 revealed two new message products that also differed by 250 bases from the corresponding wild type β-tubulin transcripts. To precisely define the region of the alteration, cloning and sequencing of the mutant and wild type genomic β-tubulin genes were conducted. A size-selected EcoRI genomic library was prepared using the Stratagene lambda Zap II <b>phage</b> <b>cloning</b> system. Using subclones of CHO β-tubulin cDNA as probes, a 2. 5 kb wild type clone and a 2. 3 kb mutant clone were identified from this library.

Sequencing of the mutant 2. 3 kb clone revealed that the mutation is due to a 246 base pair internal deletion in exon 4 (base pair 756 - 1001) that encodes amino acids 253 - 334.

Twenty patients who developed PMI after CABG and 20 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched patients without PMI after CABG were enrolled as a discovery cohort. Another 50 patients who developed PMI after CABG and 50 randomly selected patients without PMI after CABG were enrolled as a validation cohort to validate the potential peptide biomarkers identified in the discovery cohort. Fifty randomly selected healthy volunteers were also enrolled in the validation phase as a healthy control group.

In contrast, a branched tree-peptide bearing 4 EGKQRR sequences did bind to lactoferrin (Kd approximately 29 microM) and was also capable of inhibiting the binding of the phage to lactoferrin (IC(50) approximately 17 microM), indicating that avidity was important.

We found that all of the HXXNPF motif-containing molecules could bind to the gp 41 core, and that their binding sites may be located in the N-helix domain. L 7. 8 -g 3 p* and JCH- 4 effectively inhibited HIV- 1 Env (envelope glycoprotein) -mediated syncytium formation at 37  °C, while the <b>phage</b> <b>clone</b> L 7. 8 showed no inhibition under the same conditions. However, at suboptimal temperature (31. 5  °C), all of these HXXNPF motif-containing molecules were capable of inhibiting syncytium formation. These results suggest that these HXXNPF motif-containing molecules mainly bind to the gp 41 core and stop the fusion process mediated by the fusion-active core, resulting in inhibition of HIV- 1 fusion and entry. The HXXNPF motif-containing molecules may be used as probes for studying the role of the HIV- 1 gp 41 core in the late stage of the membrane-fusion process...|$|R

Here, we examined if subgroups of SSc patients with different anti-CENP-A antibody subspecificities also differ clinically, and if serum reactivity to phage-displayed peptides can predict pulmonary vascular disease. Clinical data and serum samples were collected from 84 anti-CENP-A-positive SSc patients. Indirect ELISAs were used to test serum reactivity. Pulmonary vascular disease was defined as high systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) and low diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO; percent of predicted values). Sera were screened for reactivity to peptides expressed by <b>phage</b> <b>clones</b> pc 4. 2 and pc 14. 1, confirming our earlier observation of differential specificities. Linear regression showed that the levels of antibodies specific for the 2 <b>phage</b> <b>clones</b> were associated with clinical features of pulmonary vascular disease, but in opposite ways: anti-pc 4. 2 antibodies were positively associated with sPAP and inversely associated with DLCO, whereas anti-pc 14. 1 antibodies were inversely associated with sPAP and positively associated with DLCO. Anti-pc 4. 2 and anti-pc 14. 1 antibody levels predicted sPAP independently of DLCO. These associations were confirmed by logistic regression using antibodies as predictors and dichotomized sPAP (cutoff, 45 mmHg) as outcome. The ratio of the 2 antibody levels was a useful marker in predicting high sPAP. This study demonstrates that some SSc clinical features associate with subspecificities of anti-CENP-A antibodies. Moreover, it shows that a simple, inexpensive phage-based assay can predict which SSc patients have high sPAP and low DLCO, hence who are at greater risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension. The ability to identify these at-risk patients can contribute to clinical efficiency and effectiveness. Further research into the peptides expressed by the <b>phage</b> <b>clones</b> may reveal the molecular mechanisms that put some anti-CENP-A-positive patients at greater risk than others for pulmonary vascular disease...|$|R

METHODS: The recombinant phage displaying libraries for anti-colorectal tumor mAb MC 3 Ab, MC 5 Ab and anti-gastric tumor mAb MGD 1 was constructed. Panning and screening were carried out by means of modified fixation of colorectal and gastric tumor cells expressed the mAb-binding antigens. Concordance of binding specificity to tumor cells between <b>phage</b> <b>clones</b> and parent antibodies was analyzed. The <b>phage</b> of positive <b>clones</b> was identified wit...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA novel peptide {{technology}} to produce mimicking peptides of carbohydrate moiety (which we propose to name glyco-replica peptides) {{is a useful}} tool to elucidate the functions of glycoconjugate. Carbohydrate moiety of ganglioside GD 1 α functions as a molecule involved in the adhesion between murine highly metastatic lymphoma RAW 117 -H 10 cells and hepatic sinusoidal endothelial (HSE) cells. To prepare peptides which mimic the carbohydrate structure of GD 1 α, <b>phage</b> <b>clones</b> expressing peptides which bound to a monoclonal antibody against GD 1 α (KA 17) were isolated from a phage-displayed random peptide library. Four <b>phage</b> <b>clones</b> having affinity to the monoclonal antibody KA 17 were isolated, and these clones showed inhibitory effect on the binding of KA 17 to GD 1 α. The amino acid sequences of the displayed pentadecamers were determined, {{and one of the}} phages displaying sequence WHWRHRIPLQLAAGR bound to HSE cells directly and showed the highest inhibitory effect on the adhesion between RAW 117 -H 10 cells and HSE cells. The synthesized peptides having the same sequences to the displayed 15 mers in the four isolated <b>phage</b> <b>clones</b> also showed the inhibitory effect on the adhesion of RAW 117 -H 10 cells to HSE cells, and, again, the WHWRHRIPLQLAAGR peptide showed the highest inhibitory effect. Furthermore, intravenous injection of the peptide brought almost complete inhibition of the metastasis of RAW 117 -H 10 cells to lung and spleen, and about 50 % inhibition of the liver metastasis. These results indicate that GD 1 α plays an important role for metastasis of RAW 117 -H 10 cells, and the peptides obtained by the present procedure are able to mimic the functional role of the glycoconjugate...|$|R

Affinity ligands derived from bacteriophage (phage) library screens can be developed to molecularly target prostate cancer with fluorochromes for optical imaging. Toward this goal, we used in vivo phage display and a newly described micropanning assay to select for phage that extravasate and bind human PC- 3 prostate carcinoma xenografts in severe combined immune deficiency mice. One resulting <b>phage</b> <b>clone</b> (G 1) displaying the peptide sequence IAGLATPGWSHWLAL was fluorescently labeled with the near-infrared fluorophore AlexaFluor 680 and was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo {{for its ability to}} bind and target PC- 3 prostate carcinomas. The fluorescently labeled <b>phage</b> <b>clone</b> (G 1) had a tumor-to-muscle ratio of ~ 30 in experiments. In addition, prostate tumors (PC- 3) were readily detectable by optical-imaging methods. These results show proof of principle that diseasespecific library-derived fluorescent probes can be rapidly developed for use in the early detection of cancers by optical means...|$|R
40|$|Human endothelial-specific {{targeting}} peptides {{were identified}} by biopanning within freshly-obtained human umbilical cords. Umbilical veins were cleaned in situ and M 13 phage display libraries were passed through the cords. Tightly bound phage were recovered following isolation of endothelial cells by collagenase digestion and homogenisation, allowing production of enriched phage libraries for subsequent rounds of panning. After five rounds of biopanning, five promising sequences were selected and the binding of the corresponding <b>phage</b> <b>clones</b> was compared in perfused umbilical veins. Each of these peptides showed substantial binding, although the clone encoding the heptapeptide KPSGLTY showed the greatest, some 89 -times greater than insertless phage. Binding of this <b>phage</b> <b>clone</b> was examined to cells in vitro, where it demonstrated at least five-times greater binding to isolated human umbilical vein endothelial cells than to 911, SKOV 3, B 16 F 10 and Cos 7 cells. These initial peptides may prove useful targeting agents for endothelial-selective delivery, and this powerful approach should be readily applicable to biopanning in {{a broad range of}} human vessels ex vivo...|$|R

A genomic library of this strain {{was constructed in}} the Lambda L 47 - 1 vector, and screened {{for the presence of}} PL and Cx on pectate and caboxymethylcellulose agar. Among the seven Cx-positive <b>phage</b> <b>clones,</b> three were shown to encode an enzyme of the same mol. wt. as the one found in the culture supernatant of strain 3937. The 34 PL-positive <b>phage</b> <b>clones</b> were analyzed by electrofocusing and could, according to the PL they produced, be arranged in five classes. Phages from three classes produced three different single PL, named PLb, c and d. No common fragment was evidenced between the inserts of the phages of these three classes. This demonstrated that, in strain 3937, PLb, C, and d were encoded by three different genes called pelB, C, and D. Furthermore, our results suggest the existence of two additional genes encoding PLa and e. In addition, a pectin methylesterase gene was found closely linked to pelD...|$|R

40|$|The genetic {{defects in}} Prader-Willi {{syndrome}} (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) map to 15 q 11 - 13. Using microdissection, we have recently isolated several DNA probes for the critical region. Here {{we report that}} microclone MN 7 detects multiple loci in 15 q 11 - 13 and 16 p 11. 2. Eight yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) <b>clones,</b> two genomic <b>phage</b> <b>clones,</b> and two placenta cDNA clones were isolated to analyze these loci in detail. Two of the YAC clones map to 16 p. Six YAC clones and two genomic <b>phage</b> <b>clones</b> contain {{a total of four}} or five different MN 7 copies, which are spread over a large distance within 15 q 11 - 13. One cDNA clone is from chromosome 15 and one is from chromosome 16. The chromosome 15 cDNA detects transcripts of 14 and 8 kilobases in various human tissues. The presence of multiple copies of the MN 7 gene family in proximal 15 q may conceivably be related to the instability of this region and thus to the etiology of associated disorders...|$|R
40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae is a causative {{agent of}} otitis media, pneumonia, {{meningitis}} and sepsis in humans. For {{the development of}} effective vaccines able to prevent pneumococcal infection, characterization of bacterial antigens involved in host immune response is crucial. In order to identify pneumococcal proteins recognized by host antibody response, we created an S. pneumoniae D 39 genome library, displayed on lambda bacteriophage. The screening of such a library, with sera either from infected individuals or mice immunized with the S. pneumoniae D 39 strain, allowed identification of <b>phage</b> <b>clones</b> carrying S. pneumoniae B-cell epitopes. Epitope-containing fragments within {{the families of the}} histidine-triad proteins (PhtE, PhtD), the choline-binding proteins (PspA, CbpD) and zinc metalloproteinase B (ZmpB) were identified. Moreover, library screening also allowed the isolation of <b>phage</b> <b>clones</b> carrying three distinct antigenic regions of a hypothetical pneumococcal protein, encoded by the ORF spr 0075 in the R 6 strain genome sequence. In this work, Spr 0075 is first identified as an expressed S. pneumoniae gene product, having an antigenic function during infection...|$|R
40|$|Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type A (BTx-A) {{is known}} to inhibit the release of {{acetylcholine}} at the neuromuscular junctions and synapses and to cause neuroparalysis and death. In this study, we have identified two monoclonal antibodies, BT 57 - 1 and BT 150 - 3, which protect ICR mice against lethal doses of BTx-A challenge. The neutralizing activities for BT 57 - 1 and BT 150 - 3 were 103 and 104 times the 50 % lethal dose, respectively. Using immunoblotting analysis, BT 57 - 1 was recognized as a light chain and BT 150 - 3 was recognized as a heavy chain of BTx-A. Also, applying the phage display method, we investigated the antibodies' neutralizing B-cell epitopes. These immunopositive <b>phage</b> <b>clones</b> displayed consensus motifs, Asp-Pro-Leu for BT 57 - 1 and Cys-X-Asp-Cys for BT 150. The synthetic peptide P 4 M (KGTFDPLQEPRT) corresponded to the phage-displayed peptide selected by BT 57 - 1 {{and was able to}} bind the antibodies specifically. This peptide was also shown by competitive inhibition assay to be able to inhibit <b>phage</b> <b>clone</b> binding to BT 57 - 1. Aspartic acid (D 5) in P 4 M was crucial to the binding of P 4 M to BT 57 - 1, since its binding activity dramatically decreased when it was changed to lysine (K 5). Finally, immunizing mice with the selected <b>phage</b> <b>clones</b> elicited a specific humoral response against BTx-A. These results suggest that phage-displayed random-peptide libraries are useful in identifying the neutralizing epitopes of monoclonal antibodies. In the future, the identification of the neutralizing epitopes of BTx-A may provide important information for the identification of the BTx-A receptor and the design of a BTx-A vaccine...|$|R
