Most of these lists of propositions were put {{together}} into systematic collections of <b>prohibited</b> <b>articles.</b> Of these, the Condemnations of 1277 are considered particularly important by those historians who consider {{that they had a}} side effect of encouraging scholars to question the tenets of Aristotelian science. From this perspective, some revisionist historians maintain that the condemnations had positive effects on the development of science, perhaps even representing the beginnings of modern science.|$|E
25|$|The {{police also}} have stop and search powers {{which they can}} use if they have {{reasonable}} grounds {{to believe that they}} will find stolen or <b>prohibited</b> <b>articles</b> or controlled drugs. Under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, a senior police officer can authorise police officers in a locality to stop and search any pedestrian or vehicle where the officer has grounds for believing that the individual is carrying an offensive weapon or dangerous instrument. In 1998 this legislation was extended to allow the officer to require the person to remove clothing worn for the purpose of concealing his identity, and to confiscate that article of clothing. Special extended powers also apply in the case of terrorist suspects. A person may be detained without charge for up to 24 hours, which can be extended for a further 12 hours by a senior officer {{in the case of a}} serious arrestable offence and further extended by a magistrates' court up to a total of 60 hours in respect of indictable offences. Suspected terrorists may be detained for up to 48 hours without charge and immigrants and asylum-seekers may be detained for examination by immigration officers for an unlimited period.|$|E
60|$|She {{took off}} her kerchief and her gown and calmly {{submitted}} to the woman's rough hands as they wandered with sureness and accuracy to the various pockets and folds that might conceal <b>prohibited</b> <b>articles.</b> The woman did her work with peculiar stolidity; she did not utter a word when she found the tiny steel files and placed them on a table beside her. In equal silence she laid the little dagger beside them, and the purse which contained twenty gold pieces. These she counted in front of Marguerite and then replaced them in the purse. Her face expressed neither surprise, nor greed nor pity. She was obviously {{beyond the reach of}} bribery--just a machine paid by the prison authorities to do this unpleasant work, and no doubt terrorised into doing it conscientiously.|$|E

Here is a list, however, that may give you an idea of what kind of things the public sent through our mail-bags last year. A packet of pudding, a steam-gauge, a tin of cream, a bird's wing, a musical box, packet of snowdrops, fruit sweets, shrimps, and sample potatoes; a dormouse, four white mice, two goldfinches, a lizard and a blind-worm, all alive; besides cutlery, medicines, varnish, ointments, perfumery, articles of dress; a stoat, a squirrel, fish, leeches, frogs, beetles, caterpillars, and vegetables. Of course, many of these, such as live animals, being <b>prohibited</b> <b>articles,</b> were stopped and sent to the Returned Letter Office, but were restored, on application, to the senders." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the course}} of the {{conversation}} that succeeded, the officers explained to me the difficulties they had to contend with, which certainly are not trifling. As to station, they said that made no great difference, your duchess being usually an inveterate smuggler. Travellers are not content to supply their own wants, but they purchase for all their friends. This I knew to be true, though not by experience, you will permit me to say, the ambassador's bags, half the time, containing more <b>prohibited</b> <b>articles</b> than despatches. But, notwithstanding this explanation, I did not deem the case of one who bought only for himself the less hard. It is so easy to conceal light articles, that, except in instances where is reason for distrust, it were better to confide in character. If anything could induce me to enter seriously into the contraband, it would be such treatment.|$|E
60|$|This article {{provided}} for a direct {{trade between the}} United States and the British West India Islands, in American vessels not exceeding seventy tons burden, conveying the produce of the States or of the Islands; but it prohibited the exportation of molasses, sugar, coffee, cocoa, or cotton, in American vessels, either from the United States or the Islands, to {{any part of the}} world. Under this article it was a restricted intercourse, but Mr. Jay considered the admission even of small vessels, to the trade of these islands, an important advantage to the commerce of the United States. He had not sufficiently adverted to the fact that, among the <b>prohibited</b> <b>articles,</b> cotton was also a product of the Southern States. Its cultivation had been but recently introduced there; so that when he sailed for Europe hardly sufficient had been raised for domestic consumption, and at the time of signing the treaty very little, if any, had been exported. Still it was now becoming an important staple of the South, and hence the objection of the Senate to this article of the treaty. On the 24th of June two-thirds of the Senate, the constitutional majority, voted for the ratification of the treaty, stipulating, however, that an article be added suspending so much of the twelfth article as respected the West India trade, and that the President be requested to open, without delay, further negotiation on this head.|$|E

6000|$|Now, therefore, be {{it known}} that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, {{pursuant}} to the authority in me vested by the fifth section of the act of Congress approved on the 13th of July, 1861, entitled [...] "An act further {{to provide for the}} collection of duties on imports, and for other purposes," [...] do hereby declare that the blockade of the said port of Brownsville shall so far cease and determine from and after this date, that commercial intercourse with said port, except as to persons, things, and information hereinafter specified, may, from this date, be carried on, subject to the laws of the United States, to the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and, until the rebellion shall have been suppressed, to such orders as may be promulgated by the general commanding the department, or by an officer duly authorized by him and commanding at said port. This proclamation does not authorize or allow the shipment or conveyance of persons in, or intending to enter, the service of the insurgents, or of things or information intended for their use, or for their aid or comfort, nor, except upon the permission of the Secretary of War, or of some officer duly authorized by him, of the following <b>prohibited</b> <b>articles,</b> namely: cannon, mortars, firearms, pistols, bombs, grenades, powder, saltpeter, sulphur, balls, bullets, pikes, swords, boarding-caps (always excepting the quantity of the said articles which may be necessary for the defense of the ship and those who compose the crew), saddles, bridles, cartridge-bag material, percussion and other caps, clothing adapted for uniforms; sail-cloth of all kinds, hemp and cordage, intoxicating drinks other than beer and light native wines.|$|E
60|$|Little heed {{was taken}} of any thing astern, by those {{on board the}} Plantagenet. Every one saw, it is true, that ship {{followed}} ship in due succession, {{as long as the}} movements of those inshore could be perceived at all; but the great interest centred on the horizon to the southward and eastward. In that quarter of the channel the French were expected to appear, for the cause of this sudden departure was a secret from no one in the fleet. A dozen of the best look-outs in the ship were kept aloft the whole afternoon, and Captain Greenly, himself, sat in the forward-cross-trees, with a glass, for more than an hour, just as the sun was setting, in order to sweep the horizon. Two or three sail were made, it is true, but they all proved to be English coasters; Guernsey or Jerseymen, standing for ports in the west of England, most probably laden with <b>prohibited</b> <b>articles</b> from the country of the enemy. Whatever may be the dislike of an Englishman for a Frenchman, he has no dislike to the labour of his hands; and there probably has not been a period since civilization has introduced the art of smuggling among its other arts, when French brandies, and laces, and silks, were not exchanged against English tobacco and guineas, and that in a contraband way, let it be in peace or let it be in war. One of the characteristics of Sir Gervaise Oakes was to despise all petty means of annoyance; usually he disdained even to turn aside to chase a smuggler. Fishermen he never molested at all; and, on the whole, he carried on a marine warfare, a century since, in a way that some of his successors might have imitated to advantage in our own times. Like that high-spirited Irishman, Caldwell,[2] who conducted a blockade in the Chesapeake, at the commencement of the revolution, with so much liberality, that his enemies actually sent him an invitation to a public dinner, Sir Gervaise knew how to distinguish between the combatant and the non-combatant, and heartily disdained all the money-making parts of his profession, though large sums had fallen into his hands, in this way, as pure God-sends. No notice was taken, therefore, of any thing that had not a warlike look; the noble old ship standing steadily on towards the French coast, as the mastiff passes the cur, on his way to encounter another animal, of a mould and courage more worthy of his powers.|$|E

50|$|Elias left Balmain to re-join the Rabbitohs mid-way {{though the}} 1994 Winfield Cup season. That season Elias was {{involved}} in a match-fixing plot that involved four players from his Souths team and four players from Wests. Elias was jailed for nine months in 1995 after pleading guilty in the NSW District Court to two counts of supplying amphetamines, one count of possessing F1 sub-machinegun parts and one count of possessing <b>prohibited</b> <b>articles,</b> namely military-style flak vests. Elias was the inaugural captain of the Lebanese rugby league team when they made their début in the 1997 World Sevens tournament, going on to reach the quarter-finals. He later travelled to France to play for Avignon and Toulouse. Elias was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1999 at age 38, but postponed chemotherapy to play an international match for Lebanon against France. Later he underwent surgery to remove a tennis-ball sized lymphoma which had burst inside his stomach, forcing him into retirement.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{charge against}} Bedi was giving undue favours to the notorious {{criminal}} Charles Sobhraj. At that time, the Delhi Jail Manual (written in 1894 and modified in 1988) listed {{a number of}} <b>prohibited</b> <b>articles,</b> {{one of which was}} a typewriter. However, the manual also gave the jail superintendent the power to allow any of these prohibited items in special cases. Using this power, Bedi permitted Sobhraj the use of an electronic typewriter (Sobhraj had already been given a manual typewriter before Bedi became the officer in-charge). Bedi had also allowed NGOs to start typing classes for prisoners, but Sobhraj claimed that he was using the typewriter to write her biography, which gave the authorities a reason to accuse Bedi of misusing her powers. Khurana also alleged that Sobhraj had been supplied with a pipe and foreign-made cigars, a charge refuted by the testimony of Sobhraj's former cell-mate. The prison manual also had an antiquated rule which stated that [...] "caught escapees will wear a red cap". Sobhraj had escaped in 1986, before he was recaptured. Khurana alleged that Bedi had specially exempted him from wearing a red cap. However, a senior jail officer stated that he had never seen the 'red cap' rule being implemented in Tihar. PK Dave and Madan Lal Khurana got Bedi removed as the prisons in-charge on 3 May 1995. When her transfer was announced, the Tihar inmates went on a hunger strike to protest it, while some of the warders celebrated it by distributing sweets. Bedi accused [...] "unethical politicians" [...] of [...] "telling lies, making false allegations and misinforming people". She alleged that her supervisors in the government had no [...] "interest, vision or leadership". She argued that she should not have been transferred on the basis of unverified charges, and demanded an inquiry committee. Rajesh Pilot defended her publicly, but the Union Government did not officially support her. Khushwant Singh described her transfer as [...] "a victory for a handful of small-minded, envious people over a gutsy woman".|$|E

This constitution called for a centralized control of the market and re-committed the state to providing its citizens with access to free education and health care, as in the 1940 constitution. The state was further granted the power to regulate the activities of religious institutions and the private ownership of media was <b>prohibited.</b> <b>Article</b> 53 gave citizens freedom of speech, and Article 54 gave citizens the right to assemble.|$|R
