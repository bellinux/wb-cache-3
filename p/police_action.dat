5|$|In January 2114, 42 {{years after}} the Citadel events and 12 years into {{rebuilding}} TriOptimum, the company created an experimental FTL starship, the Von Braun, which is now on its maiden voyage. The ship is also followed by a UNN space vessel, the Rickenbacker, which is controlled by Captain William Bedford Diego, son of Edward Diego, the Citadel Station's infamous commander and public hero of the Battle of the Boston Harbor during the Eastern States <b>Police</b> <b>Action.</b> Because the Rickenbacker {{does not have an}} FTL system of its own, the two ships are attached for the trip. However, Korenchkin was egotistical enough to make himself the captain of the Von Braun despite being inexperienced.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Sanford became {{president}} of Duke University, a position he held for the next 16 years. That helped quell student unrest over the Vietnam War early in his tenure as university president. Addressing the protests of the 1970 Kent State shootings with tolerance, choosing to not call in police to clear the roads, leading to the protesting students going back to their rooms at night so that West Campus could be reopened the next day kept the campus calm during a turbulent spring. Shortly before his tenure, on February 13, 1969, 60 student members of the Afro-American Society had occupied Duke's main administration center, the Allen Building, demanding {{the creation of a}} Black Studies program. After three days of clashes with police, they left the building peaceably February 16, when school officials agreed to the program. During his tenure, Sanford strongly opposed confrontation and a heavy <b>police</b> <b>action</b> which helped defuse racial tensions.|$|E

5|$|On 25 January, a {{clash between}} {{agitating}} students and Congress party workers in Madurai went {{out of control and}} became a riot. Rioting soon spread {{to other parts of the}} State. Police responded with lathi charges and firing on student processions. Acts of arson, looting and damage to public property became common. Railway cars and Hindi name boards at railway stations were burned down; telegraph poles were cut and railway tracks displaced. The Bhaktavatsalam Government considered the situation as a law and order problem and brought in para military forces to quell the agitation. Incensed by <b>police</b> <b>action,</b> violent mobs killed two police men. Several agitators committed suicide by self-immolation and by consuming poison. In two weeks of riots, around 70 people were killed (by official estimates). Some unofficial reports put the death toll as high as 500. A large number of students were arrested. The damage to property was assessed to be ten million rupees.|$|E

25|$|In late July 1947 the Dutch {{launched}} Operatie Product, which {{aimed to}} capture important economic {{facilities in the}} NEI.

Early in this operation the squadron attacked Solo and Madiun and claimed to have destroyed eight Indonesian aircraft on the ground. A strike on Jakarta was delayed by fog; this may have saved the life of Indonesian Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir as he left the city on board a C-47 Dakota transport at about the time the Kittyhawks were originally scheduled to arrive.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of representation by government employees has increased considerably {{in the past}} 30 years. Scholars have found that represented groups benefit from represen-tative bureaucracies and conclude that this benefit {{is a function of}} active representation. However, due to the aggregate unit of observation used in most of these studies and the outcome measures that are typically used as dependent variables, we argue that there are other forms of representation that can explain these finding. We contribute to the existing research in this area by focusing on symbolic representation and conduct our test using individual-level data from a national police-citizen contact survey. We hypothesize that citizen perceptions of legitimacy regarding <b>police</b> <b>actions</b> are shaped by the interaction of citizen race and officer race. Our results suggest that symbolic representation does occur— blacks are more likely to perceive <b>police</b> <b>actions</b> as being legitimate if there are black officers present. Additionally, whites are more likely to perceive <b>police</b> <b>actions</b> as legitimate if the actions were conducted by white officers...|$|R
