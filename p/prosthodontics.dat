25|$|Dentures (also {{known as}} false teeth) are {{prosthetic}} devices constructed to replace missing teeth; they {{are supported by}} the surrounding soft and hard tissues of the oral cavity. Conventional dentures are removable (removable partial denture or complete denture). However, there are many denture designs, some which rely on bonding or clasping onto teeth or dental implants (fixed <b>prosthodontics).</b> There are two main categories of dentures, the distinction being whether {{they are used to}} replace missing teeth on the mandibular arch or on the maxillary arch.|$|E
25|$|Dental {{school is}} four {{academic}} years in duration and {{is similar in}} format to medical school: two years of basic medical and dental sciences, followed by two years of clinical training (with continued didactic coursework). Before graduating, every dental student must successfully complete the National Board Dental Examination Part I and II (commonly referred to as NBDE I & II). The NBDE Part I is usually taken {{at the end of}} the second year after the majority of the didactic courses have been completed. The NBDE Part I covers Gross Anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, microbiology, pathology, and dental anatomy and occlusion. The NBDE Part II is usually taken during winter of the last year of dental school and consists of operative dentistry, pharmacology, endodontics, periodontics, oral surgery, pain control, <b>prosthodontics,</b> orthodontics, pedodontics, oral pathology, and radiology. NBDE Part I scores are Pass/Fail since 2012.|$|E

2500|$|The {{prevalence}} of Kennedy Class III [...] partial denture was predominant among younger population of 21-30 year and 31–40 years, whereas in group III between 41 and 50 years Class I was predominant. It can be {{stated that the}} need for <b>prosthodontics</b> care is expected to increase with age, and hence, more efforts should be made for improving dental education and motivation among patients.|$|E
2500|$|Class III RPDs are {{fabricated}} {{for people}} who are missing some teeth {{in such a way that}} the edentulous area has teeth remaining both posterior and anterior to it. Unlike Class I and Class II RPDs which are both tooth-and-tissue-borne (meaning they both clasp onto teeth, as well as rest on the posterior edentulous area for support), Class III RPDs are strictly tooth-borne, which means they only clasp onto teeth and do not need to rest on the tissue for added support. This makes Class III RPDs exceedingly more secure as per the three rules of removable prostheses that will be mentioned later, namely: support, stability and retention. (See the article on dentures for a more thorough review of these three fundamentals of removable <b>prosthodontics.)</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{embodiment of}} the system (the 1905 Atlas) had some deficiencies as a physical representation of the theoretical system. These were improved significantly in the 1929 Munsell Book of Color and through an extensive series of experiments {{carried out by the}} Optical Society of America in the 1940s resulting in the notations (sample definitions) for the modern Munsell Book of Color. [...] Though several replacements for the Munsell system have been invented, building on Munsell’s foundational ideas—including the Optical Society of America’s Uniform Color Scales, and the International Commission on Illumination’s CIELAB (L*a*b*) and CIECAM02 color models—the Munsell system is still widely used, by, among others, ANSI to define skin and hair colors for forensic pathology, the USGS for matching soil colors, in <b>prosthodontics</b> during the selection of shades for dental restorations, and breweries for matching beer colors.|$|E

50|$|Fixed <b>prosthodontics</b> is {{the area}} of <b>prosthodontics</b> focused on {{permanently}} attached (fixed) dental prostheses. Such dental restorations, {{also referred to as}} indirect restorations, include crowns, bridges (fixed dentures), inlays, onlays, and veneers. Prosthodontists are specialist dentists who have undertaken training recognized by academic institutions in this field. Fixed <b>prosthodontics</b> can be used to restore single or multiple teeth, spanning areas where teeth have been lost. In general, the main advantages of fixed <b>prosthodontics</b> when compared to direct restorations is the superior strength when used in large restorations, and the ability to create an aesthetic looking tooth. As with any dental restoration, principles used to determine the appropriate restoration involves consideration of the materials to be used, extent of tooth destruction, orientation and location of tooth, and condition of neighboring teeth.|$|E
