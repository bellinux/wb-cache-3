50|$|Markman and Wachtel's 1988 studies {{demonstrated}} {{the learning process}} through the whole-object and mutual exclusivity assumption. The experimenter told three-year-old children a word and then showed them a picture. She asked whether the label referred to the whole object or a part and outlined each option with her finger. When the whole object was unfamiliar they pointed to the part in only 20% of the trials, but pointed to the part in 57% of the trials when the object was familiar. A recent study attempted to replicate and extend these results. Hansen and Markman taught children a new word for {{a part of a}} real object by saying the word and tracing the object's contours. (These gestures were meant to remain as naturalistic as possible). They then asked children to point to the new part in order to identify if they have linked the new name to the intended part. The main manipulation was whether the object was familiar or not. Upholding the mutual exclusivity assumption children pointed to the intended part more often in the familiar object condition. Furthermore, the gesture of pointing/outlining the part itself was insufficient for children to learn the <b>part</b> <b>name.</b> Mutual exclusivity and a gesture were necessary for children to select the novel part.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the use of}} a caregiver’s actions and eye-gaze in teaching whole or part names. The experimental material consisted of two everyday objects, a toothbrush (the whole name was “haburashi”, the <b>part</b> <b>name</b> was “ke”) and a ball-point pen. We coded 4 action type categories and 2 eye gaze type categories based on the video data of 19 4 -year-old child-mother dyads using frame-by-frame method. Results of actions showed that when the caregiver uttered a whole object name such as toothbrush (“haburashi”), the caregiver tended to present the object to the child by showing it. When she uttered a <b>part</b> <b>name</b> to teach the <b>part</b> <b>name</b> such as brush (“ke”), she pointed at the object part. Results of eye gaze analysis showed whereas the caregiver tended to look at the child’s face in teaching whole names, she tended to look at the object in teaching part names. We found that caregivers use different gestures and eye gaze directions to teach whole or object part names. The study suggests that caregivers help young children’s word learning using appropriate gestures and gaze directions...|$|E
40|$|Learning {{names for}} parts of objects can be {{challenging}} for children, as it requires overcoming their tendency to name whole objects. We test whether comparing items can facilitate learning names for their parts. Applying the structure-mapping theory of comparison leads to two predictions: (1) young children will {{find it easier to}} identify a common part between two very similar items than between two dissimilar items (because the similar pair is easier to align); (2) close alignments potentiate far alignments: children will be better able to extend a novel <b>part</b> <b>name</b> to a dissimilar object after having extended it to a similar object. In three studies, 227 preschool children mapped novel part terms to new animals or objects. Both predictions were confirmed. Children more accurately extended novel part terms to objects that were similar to the standard than to objects that were dissimilar (Experiments 1 and 2); and children more accurately extended novel part names to dissimilar objects after having extended them to similar objects (Experiment 3). We conclude that structure-mapping processes can support word learning...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedGeneral Motors and Ford Motor Company maintain complete Configuration Control {{of their products}} and automobiles. That is, a customer orders a replacement vehicle part from their local dealership. Within a few days, they receive the part that meets the form, fit, and function requirement. Military personnel requiring replacement or spare parts must submit a written request which requires the <b>part</b> <b>name,</b> number with revision level, and the national stock number. Barring any delays, the part is received within two to three days. In most cases, however, there are delays and it takes up to several weeks to receive the part. The purpose of this thesis is to identify the key elements required for Configuration Management, identify policies, procedures, and regulations that govern, shape and dictate secondary item procurements, and to analyze Department of the Army's and Industry's spare parts procurement process. This thesis shows the Department of the Army's and Industry's Configuration Management models are similar; but the polices and regulations that govern, shape and dictate secondary item procurements are quite different; and that Congress and Government agencies must change their policies to adapt to commercial practices. The thesis also demonstrates that the current direction the Government is taking in acquisition reform will seriously impede improvements {{in the field of}} Configuration Management, which encompasses the development and maintenance of technical data packages that support secondary item procurements[URL]...|$|E
