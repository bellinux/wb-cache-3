5|$|More {{problematic}} {{are those}} {{cases where the}} movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with petroglyphs. A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of Fajada Butte at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral <b>petroglyph.</b> The location of a dagger of light on the <b>petroglyph</b> varies throughout the year. At the summer solstice a dagger can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this <b>petroglyph</b> was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico. It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices. The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer solstice, winter solstice, equinox, and the major and minor lunar standstills of the moon’s 18.6 year cycle. In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon. Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.|$|E
5|$|If no ethnographic nor {{historical}} data are found which can support this assertion then {{acceptance of the}} idea relies upon {{whether or not there}} are enough <b>petroglyph</b> sites in North America that such a correlation could occur by chance. It is helpful when petroglyphs are associated with existing peoples. This allows ethnoastronomers to question informants as to the meaning of such symbols.|$|E

50|$|The Sugar Grove <b>Petroglyphs</b> are a {{group of}} <b>petroglyphs</b> in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Located on an outcrop of {{sandstone}} in Monongahela Township near {{the eastern edge of}} Greene County, the <b>petroglyphs</b> have been known since at least the 1930s. Due to their value as an archaeological site, the <b>petroglyphs</b> have been named a historic site.|$|R

5|$|In folk-stories, Scandinavian elves often {{play the}} role of disease-spirits. The most common, though also most {{harmless}} case was various irritating skin rashes, which were called älvablåst (elven puff) and could be cured by a forceful counter-blow (a handy pair of bellows was most useful for this purpose). Skålgropar, a particular kind of <b>petroglyph</b> (pictogram on a rock) found in Scandinavia, were known in older times as älvkvarnar (elven mills), because it was believed elves had used them. One could appease the elves by offering them a treat (preferably butter) placed into an elven mill.|$|E
5|$|Supernova SN 1054 {{was another}} widely {{observed}} event, with Arab, Chinese, and Japanese astronomers recording the star's appearance in 1054 CE. It {{may also have}} been recorded by the Anasazi as a <b>petroglyph.</b> This explosion appeared in the constellation of Taurus, where it produced the Crab Nebula remnant. At its peak, the luminosity of SN 1054 may have been four times as bright as Venus, and it remained visible in daylight for 23 days and was visible in the night sky for 653 days.|$|E
5|$|Rock art {{is found}} {{throughout}} the Mesa Verde region, but its dispersion is uneven and periodic. Some locations have numerous examples; others have none, and some periods saw prolific creation, while others saw little. Styles also vary over time. Examples are relatively rare on Mesa Verde proper, but abundant in the middle San Juan River area, which might indicate the river's importance as a travel route and key source of water. Common motifs in the rock art of the region include, anthropomorphic figures in procession and during copulation or childbirth, handprints, animal and people tracks, wavy lines, spirals, concentric circles, animals, and hunting scenes. As the region's population plummeted during the late 13th century, the subject of Mesa Verdean rock art increasingly shifted to depictions of shields, warriors, and battle scenes. Modern Hopi have interpreted the petroglyphs at Mesa Verde's <b>Petroglyph</b> Point as depictions of various clans of people.|$|E

In 1991 he reinterprets the Maidu Creation myth all over again using imagery influenced by <b>petroglyphs.</b> He {{began a series of}} paintings he called Stone Poems, that draw heavily from these <b>petroglyphs.</b> A series of these paintings were exhibited in the Southwest Museum (Los Angeles, California) in 1989.|$|R
5000|$|The rocks {{include both}} simple <b>petroglyphs</b> such as {{straight}} lines and swirls {{and more complex}} <b>petroglyphs</b> that resemble trees, flowers, or the veins of a leaf. There also is an intricate diamond pattern on one rock. The smallest are approximately 8 in in width, while the largest are 3 ft. Grooves are approximately [...]4 to [...]8 in deep. The carvings are deeper and larger than those typically found in the Southwestern United States. The meaning of the carvings is unknown. The Connick team suggested the <b>petroglyphs</b> may represent meteorological symbols such as clouds and lightning. Benson's team suggests the Winnemucca Lake <b>petroglyphs</b> share several distinctive features {{in common with the}} Long Lake <b>petroglyphs</b> that are not found in more recent <b>petroglyphs.</b>|$|R
5|$|The glyphs are stylized human, animal, {{vegetable}} and geometric shapes, and often form compounds. Nearly all those with heads are oriented {{head up and}} are either seen face on or in profile to the right, {{in the direction of}} writing. It is not known what significance turning a glyph head-down or to the left may have had. Heads often have characteristic projections on the sides which may be eyes (as on the sea turtle glyph below, and more clearly on sea-turtle petroglyphs) but which often resemble ears (as on the anthropomorphic <b>petroglyph</b> in the next section). Birds are common; many resemble the frigatebird (see image directly below) which was associated with the supreme god Makemake. Other glyphs look like fish or arthropods. A few are similar to petroglyphs found throughout the island.|$|E
25|$|The Ometepe <b>Petroglyph</b> Project was a {{volunteer}} field {{survey of the}} Maderas half of Ometepe from 1995–1999.

50|$|Jeffry Cliff <b>Petroglyphs</b> (15HA114) are prehistoric <b>petroglyphs</b> {{created by}} Native Americans, {{that lived in}} the western region {{of what is now}} the U.S. state of Kentucky. They are located on and around Jeffry Cliff in Hancock County, {{although}} the address is restricted. The <b>petroglyphs</b> cover a roughly 9 acre area and are open to public access. These <b>petroglyphs</b> were designated a National Historical Site by the National Park Service on September 8, 1989, and were subsequently assigned the reference number 89001191. The <b>petroglyphs</b> appear to be created for several purposes that include art, religion, and engineering.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the European {{settlement}} of southwestern Pennsylvania, several <b>petroglyphs</b> were present within Fayette County's present boundaries. Among the sites that survived into modern times were ones known as the New Geneva <b>Petroglyphs,</b> the <b>Petroglyphs</b> Opposite Millsboro, and the Dunn Farm <b>Petroglyphs.</b> Many sites in the upper Ohio River valley, including several in Fayette County, were destroyed in the late twentieth century, making the Francis Farm site extremely valuable for future students of Native American petroglyphy. Because of their archaeological value, the Francis Farm <b>Petroglyphs</b> were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.|$|R

25|$|The Ometepe <b>Petroglyph</b> {{project is}} an {{interesting}} example of modern technology assisting in the recording of archaeological sites. As the prehistoric art sites were being surveyed and recorded, pictures were taken of each site in both color and black and white. A video was even made at one site. Photos were then uploaded into a computer, and the Photoshop program was then used to increase the contrast of the photos, increasing the visibility of the petroglyphs pictured. This allowed for a more accurate record of sites that by necessity were photographed in less than ideal conditions and lighting. In addition to the remote area and poor lighting, on Ometepe Island, {{the depth of the}} engraved lines on petroglyphs thus far recorded varies from “immeasurably shallow” to around three centimeters (Ometepe <b>Petroglyph</b> Project Website, 2006).|$|E

25|$|A ki' pohaku (<b>petroglyph)</b> of {{a turtle}} (or honu) {{can be found}} on The Big Island of Hawaii in the Pu'u Loa lava fields. The green sea turtle (called Honu) has always held a special meaning for Hawaiians and this <b>petroglyph</b> shows its {{importance}} dating to possibly when the islands first became populated. The turtle symbolizes a navigator that can find his way home time after time. This symbol mirrors the real life of the green Hawaiian turtle as it will swim hundreds of miles to lay its eggs at its own place of birth. Though there are other myths as well, some Hawaiian legends say the honu were the first to guide the Polynesians to the Hawaiian Islands. Hawaiians revere the turtle and the legend of Kailua, a turtle who could {{take the form of a}} girl at will. In human form, she looked after the children playing on Punalu'u beach.|$|E
