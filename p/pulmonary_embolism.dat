5|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}}, or deep {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is {{the formation of a}} blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>embolism,</b> a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolism</b> constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} for the clot to break off and migrate (embolise) to the lungs, causing a <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolism.</b> An analysis of earlier case reports concludes that this occurs in about 10% of cases, but has a very poor prognosis.|$|E

5|$|A 2014 Cochrane review {{found that}} using heparin in medical {{patients}} {{did not change}} {{the risk of death}} or <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolism.</b> While its use decreased people's risks of DVTs, it also increased people's risks of major bleeding. The review thus recommended the need to balance risks and benefits.|$|E

5|$|Diagnosis of a {{pneumothorax}} {{by physical}} examination alone {{can be difficult}} (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. Other conditions that can result in similar symptoms include a hemothorax (buildup {{of blood in the}} pleural space), <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolism,</b> and heart attack. A large bullae may look similar on a chest X-ray.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims. <b>Pulmonary</b> fat <b>embolism</b> {{can be a}} {{cause of}} death in cases with trauma, during {{orthopedic}} surgery and also in non-traumatic conditions, such as burns, pancreatitis, fatty liver or sickle cell disease. As postmortem CT angiography(PMCTA) becomes more widespread, it is important to determine how it affects the diagnosis of <b>pulmonary</b> fat <b>embolism.</b> The aims of this study were to determine if the oily contrast liquid used in PMCTA induces artefactual <b>pulmonary</b> fat <b>embolism,</b> if such artefacts differ from non-artefactual (original) <b>pulmonary</b> fat <b>embolism</b> and if <b>pulmonary</b> fat <b>embolism</b> can be detected and graded before PMCTA. Materials and Methods. Data acquisition for this prospective study was performed between November 2013 and December 2014. Consecutive cases of adults who received PMCTA followed by autopsy were included in this study. Cases were excluded if the state of alteration was too advanced. Pulmonary biopsies of each lung were taken before and after the PMCTA as were fragments of each lung with a twin-edged knife (TEK) during the autopsy. The samples were examined under the microscope without fixation or staining and after an Oil-Red 0 staining. <b>Pulmonary</b> fat <b>embolism</b> was graded according to Falci et al. Results. Fifty-four (54) cases were included. Original <b>pulmonary</b> fat <b>embolism</b> was diagnosed in 20 cases out of 54 on biopsies performed before PMCTA, almost all having presented traumatic events before death and/or rib fractures due to resuscitation attempts. As expected, structures with the aspect of <b>pulmonary</b> fat <b>embolism</b> were present in almost all cases (44 cases out 'at 54 on biopsies I 51 cases out of 54 on TEK samples) after PMCTA. The microscopic aspect of original and PMCT A-induced <b>pulmonary</b> fat <b>embolism</b> was identical. Grading of the <b>pulmonary</b> fat <b>embolism</b> according to Falci et al. depended {{on the quality of the}} biopsies. Conclusions. PMCTA with oily contrast liquid induces artefactual <b>pulmonary</b> fat <b>embolism</b> that cannot be visually differentiated from original <b>pulmonary</b> fat <b>embolism.</b> However, original <b>pulmonary</b> fat <b>embolism</b> can be diagnosed with biopsies performed before PMCT A. In order to assure the diagnosis and correct grading of <b>pulmonary</b> fat <b>embolism,</b> the quality of the biopsy should be checked before PMCT A with oily contrast is performed. If it is impossible to obtain biopsies of good quality, the indication of a PMCTA must be discussed in cases where <b>pulmonary</b> fat <b>embolism</b> is suspected, particularly if it is a potential cause of death...|$|R

5|$|The drug {{strontium}} ranelate aids bone growth, increases bone density, and {{lessen the}} incidence of vertebral, peripheral, and hip fractures. However, strontium ranelate also {{increases the risk of}} venous thromboembolism, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolism</b> and serious cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction. Its use is therefore now restricted. Its beneficial effects are also questionable, since the increased bone density is partially caused by the increased density of strontium over the calcium which it replaces. Strontium also bioaccumulates in the body.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to acute transverse myelitis, {{we have also}} faced with multiple <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolisms</b> in this case. Known etiologic factors predisposing to venous thromboembolism include reduced mobility, malignant disease, and history of venous thromboembolism [12]. Cancer patients are considered at a significantly increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism, particularly while receiving systemic chemotherapy [13]. Female sex is another reported predisposing factor for thrombosis [12]. The patient {{in this case was}} a woman with a history of colorectal cancer who had received outpatient chemotherapy and reduced mobility due to transverse myelitis. In addition, intermittent pneumatic leg compression was performed, but pharmacological prophylaxis was not performed in this case. Combined prophylaxis could prevent from developing <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolisms</b> [14].|$|R
40|$|In {{clinical}} practice pulmonologists have suspected that <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolisms</b> occur {{more often in}} patients with asthma. To confirm this suspicion, a study was initiated to investigate the incidence of venous thromboembolic events in patients with asthma compared to the general population. In addition, this study aimed to determine if any relationship between asthma and venous thromboembolic events {{could be attributed to}} asthma severity, viral infections or the use of asthma medication. The activation of coagulation in asthma was further explored in patients and healthy subjects in an attempt to understand the relationship between asthma and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolisms.</b> Results from these studies show that <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolisms</b> do indeed occur more frequently in patients with asthma as a consequence of an enhanced procoagulant state. Moreover, this procoagulant state is augmented by severe forms of asthma, viral infections (often the cause of an asthma exacerbation) and by the use of oral corticosteroids (central to the treatment of asthma exacerbations and patients with severe asthma). These findings are important, as they should make pulmonologists and general physicians aware of the procoagulant changes that occur in patients with asthma. These results can also be extrapolated to patients with other inflammatory diseases requiring corticosteroid treatment making the results relevant to all physicians treating patients with oral corticosteroids...|$|R
5|$|Warfarin, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Coumadin among others, is a {{medication}} that is used as an anticoagulant (blood thinner). It is commonly used to treat blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolism</b> and to prevent stroke in people who have atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease or artificial heart valves. Less commonly it is used following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and orthopedic surgery. It is generally taken by mouth but may also be used by injection into a vein.|$|E
5|$|A <b>{{pulmonary}}</b> <b>embolism</b> is a {{blood clot}} that becomes lodged in the pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|A {{very small}} {{proportion}} (those affected by SMAD4 (MADH4) mutations, see below) have multiple benign polyps {{in the large}} intestine, which may bleed or transform into colorectal cancer. A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure {{on the right side}} of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting and attacks of chest pain. It has been observed that the risk of thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis, in the form of deep vein thrombosis or <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolism)</b> may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{conditions}} associated with thrombophilia are {{deep vein thrombosis}} (DVT) and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolism</b> (PE), which are referred to collectively as venous thromboembolism (VTE). DVT usually occurs in the legs, and is characterized by pain, swelling and redness of the limb. It may lead to long-term swelling and heaviness due to damage to valves in the veins. The clot may also break off and migrate (embolize) to arteries in the lungs. Depending on the size {{and the location of}} the clot, this may lead to sudden-onset shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations and may be complicated by collapse, shock and cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of HIT is {{enlargement}} or extension of a previously diagnosed blood clot, or {{the development of}} a new blood clot elsewhere in the body. This may take the form of clots either in arteries or veins, causing arterial or venous thrombosis, respectively. Examples of arterial thrombosis are stroke, myocardial infarction ("heart attack"), and acute leg ischemia. Venous thrombosis may occur in the leg or arm in the form of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and in the lung in the form of a <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolism</b> (PE); the latter usually originate in the leg but migrate to the lung.|$|E
5|$|There was no autopsy, and {{the cause}} of Lambert's death is unknown. While many sources say that he died of a fatty {{degeneration}} of the heart or of stress on his heart caused by his bulk, his behaviour in the period leading to his death does not match that of someone suffering from cardiac insufficiency; witnesses agree that on the morning of his death he appeared well, before he became short of breath and collapsed. Bondeson(2006) speculates that the most consistent explanation of his death, given his symptoms and medical history, is that he had a sudden <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolism.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> tumor <b>embolism</b> rarely {{occurs in}} epithelial-derived tumors, {{but it has}} been {{described}} in different tumor entities.

30|$|In a {{statement}} by the Fleischner Society, strategies for pregnant patients were briefly discussed, but with no direct recommendations being given [20].

5|$|Warfarin is {{best suited}} for anticoagulation (clot {{formation}} inhibition) in areas of slowly running blood (such as in veins and the pooled blood behind artificial and natural valves) and in blood pooled in dysfunctional cardiac atria. Thus, common clinical indications for warfarin use are atrial fibrillation, the presence of artificial heart valves, deep venous thrombosis, and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolism</b> (where the embolized clots first form in veins). Warfarin is also used in antiphospholipid syndrome. It has been used occasionally after heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), but is far less effective at preventing new thromboses in coronary arteries. Prevention of clotting in arteries is usually undertaken with antiplatelet drugs, which act by a different mechanism from warfarin (which normally {{has no effect on}} platelet function).|$|E
5|$|Complications are {{distinct}} medical problems that may arise {{as a result}} of the TBI. The results of traumatic brain injury vary widely in type and duration; they include physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complications. TBI can cause prolonged or permanent effects on consciousness, such as coma, brain death, persistent vegetative state (in which patients are unable to achieve a state of alertness to interact with their surroundings), and minimally conscious state (in which patients show minimal signs of being aware of self or environment). Lying still for long periods can cause complications including pressure sores, pneumonia or other infections, progressive multiple organ failure, and deep venous thrombosis, which can cause <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolism.</b> Infections that can follow skull fractures and penetrating injuries include meningitis and abscesses. Complications involving the blood vessels include vasospasm, in which vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, the formation of aneurysms, in which the side of a vessel weakens and balloons out, and stroke.|$|E
5|$|Following Blackburn's relegation, it was rumoured that Robinson would {{immediately}} {{return to the}} top flight, with Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United said to be interested, however no move materialized. Speculation continued over Robinson's future throughout the season, with Brad Friedel being rumoured to be returning to the club (a rumour he denied), further fuelled by Robinson being dropped in December for a match against Blackpool in favour of Jake Kean, with Robinson having played every match {{at that point in}} the season. However, following the match against Blackpool, Robinson did not make any further appearances, with Kean taking the goalkeeper position, fuelling further rumours that Robinson could leave, and Robinson was made available for loan in February. In March, Robinson was ruled out {{for the rest of the}} season with a back injury; however, in April, he suffered complications, and was ruled out for six months as a result of a <b>pulmonary</b> <b>embolism</b> following his surgery. He finished the season having made 21 league appearances for the club.|$|E
