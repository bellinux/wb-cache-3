This thesis examines the DEP's effectiveness in preparing recruits for <b>basic</b> <b>training.</b> It examines how well the recruits were prepared; the types of training conducted; how effectively the recruits perceived their training to be while in the DEP; use of the DEP Personnel Qualification Standards (PQS); DEP meetings; and required recruiter/recruit weekly contact. Recruits at <b>basic</b> <b>training</b> were surveyed on various questions that pertained to {{their time in the}} DEP. The findings showed that training is not being conducted in the DEP.

40|$|Territorial Force army {{recruits}} (N= 184) {{participated in}} this study which aimed to determine the influence of pre-training expectation fulfilment on organizational commitment (OC) at the conclusion of, and six weeks after, their <b>basic</b> recruit <b>training</b> course. The study also aimed to identify what aspects of <b>basic</b> <b>training</b> recruits perceived as being better or worse than expected. Recruits filled out three questionnaires over a period of approximately nine weeks and the data was subjected to two hierarchical regression analyses. Results of the first regression analysis showed that the extent of training fulfilment was a significant positive predictor of OC at the end of <b>basic</b> <b>training.</b> More positive affective reactions to recruit training and higher levels of initial OC were also found to be predictive of OC at the conclusion of <b>basic</b> <b>training.</b> In the second regression analysis lower age and greater OC at the conclusion of <b>basic</b> <b>training</b> were found to be significantly predictive of greater OC six weeks after <b>basic</b> <b>training.</b> Fulfilment of expectations during <b>basic</b> <b>training</b> was not found to be predictive of OC at that point. A principal components analysis was conducted on the training fulfilment items in order to identify underlying dimensions of training fulfilment. Results showed that aspects associated with higher order needs (personal development, staff approachability, and physical challenge) were less fulfilled than those associated with lower order needs (living / working conditions, equipment adequacy). Overall, the results tend to question how pervasive the influence of fulfilled expectations during army <b>basic</b> <b>training</b> is on the attitudes of part time recruits after they leave the training environment. Implications for military advertising and realistic recruitment are also discussed...|$|R

The study was conducted on the basis of the department of weightlifting and boxing of the Kharkov State Academy of Physical Culture and Children's Sports School "KhTP". Result: correlation between the parameters of the morphofunctional, speed-power and special (competitive) readiness of weightlifters of preliminary <b>basic</b> <b>training</b> are identified. The conducted research shows that the result of competitive exercises of athletes specializing in weightlifting, at the stage of preliminary <b>basic</b> <b>training</b> depends on the strength and speed-strength preparedness.
