40|$|With the {{emergence}} of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) component middleware technologies software system integrators are increasing faced {{with the task of}} integrating heterogeneous enterprise distributed systems built using different COTS technologies. Although there are well-documented patterns and techniques for system integration using various middleware technologies, system integration is still largely a tedious and error-prone manual process. To improve this process, component developers and system integrators must understand key properties of the systems they are integrating, as well as the integration technologies they are applying.

The fundamental speed advantage of the algorithm may be greater than it appears, because SLAM is running in pure MATLAB while the other two packages use optimized compiled code...|$|R

However, the <b>functional</b> <b>integration</b> among these brain areas, i. e. how they interact and communicate to generate a coherent pain percept and an adequate behavioral response is largely unknown. Here, we used magnetoencephalography to investigate <b>functional</b> <b>integration</b> among pain-related cortical activations in terms of Granger causality and compared it to tactile-related activations. The results show causal influences of primary somatosensory cortex on secondary somatosensory cortex for tactile-related but not for pain-related activations which supports the proposition of a partially parallel organization of pain processing in the human brain. Furthermore, during a simple reaction time task, the strength of causal influences between somatosensory areas but not the latencies between activations correlated significantly {{with the speed of}} reaction times. These findings show how the analysis of <b>functional</b> <b>integration</b> complements traditional analyses of electrophysiological data and provides novel and behaviorally relevant information about the organization of the human pain system...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 65 - 68. South Africa has {{embarked}} on a range of health sector reforms {{since the start of the}} democratic government in 1994. The Primary Health Care approach has been accepted as a way of delivering cost effective, efficient and accessible comprehensive health care at the primary care level. The district health system has been promoted as the best model for the delivery of primary health care because it decentralizes power to the local, district level and it is able to integrate fragmented primary care services under one management and governance structure. In the absence of a formal, legal district health system, provincial and local government authorities have made efforts towards <b>functional</b> <b>integration</b> in primary health care. The establishment of shared health facilities with the aim of providing integrated, comprehensive health care is part of the effort towards <b>functional</b> <b>integration.</b> This study investigates the level of <b>functional</b> <b>integration</b> in joint health facilities between Local Authority (LA) and the Provincial Administration of the Western Cape (PAWC) ...|$|R
