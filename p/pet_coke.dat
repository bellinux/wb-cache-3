2500|$|India has the world's 4th largest coal reserves. In India, coal is {{the bulk}} of primary energy {{contributor}} with [...] 56.90% share equivalent to 411.9 Mtoe in 2016. India is the third top coal producer in 2013 with 7.6% production share of coal (including lignite) in the world. Top five hard and brown coal producing countries in 2013 (2012) are (million tons): China 3,680 (3,645), United States 893 (922), India 605 (607), Australia 478 (453) and Indonesia 421 (386). However, India ranks fifth in global coal production at 228 mtoe (5.9%) in 2013 when its inferior quality coal tonnage is converted into tons of oil equivalent. Coal-fired power plants account for 59% of India's installed electricity capacity. After electricity production, coal is also used for cement production in substantial quantity. In 2013, India imported nearly 95 Mtoe of steam coal and coking coal which is 29% of total consumption {{to meet the demand}} in electricity, cement and steel production. <b>Pet</b> <b>coke</b> availability, at cheaper price to local coal, is replacing coal in cement plants.|$|E
2500|$|Gasification [...] of coal or lignite or <b>pet</b> <b>coke</b> {{produces}} syngas or {{coal gas}} or {{coke oven gas}} which {{is a mixture of}} hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide gases. Coal gas can be converted into synthetic natural gas (SNG) by using Fischer–Tropsch process at low pressure and high temperature. Coal gas can also be produced by underground coal gasification where the coal deposits are located deep in the ground or uneconomical to mine the coal. [...] CNG and LNG are emerging as economical alternatives to diesel oil with the escalation in international crude oil prices. Synthetic natural gas production technologies have tremendous scope to meet the transport sector requirements fully using the locally available coal in India. Dankuni coal complex is producing syngas which is piped to the industrial users in Calcutta. Many coal based fertiliser plants which are shut down can also be retrofitted economically to produce SNG as LNG and CNG fetch good price by substituting imports. Recently, Indian government fixed the natural gas price at producer end as 5.61 US$ per mmbtu on net calorific value (NCV) basis which is at par with the estimated SNG price from coal.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe 50 g co-carbonization test of blend coals {{with two}} high-volatile {{bituminous}} coals and two low-volatile bituminous coals and added waste plastics(PE, PP, PS and PET) under 1. 33 kPa was investigated at a plastic addition ratio of 2 %~ 10 %.

In {{the study of}} coke strength, coke reactivity index and porosity, we appended the anthracite of different addition ratios of 0 %, 5 %, and 10 %. The result shows that 1) In the case of anthracite addition ratio of 5 %, the effect of PE and PP on blend coals is similar and the coke strength reaches the maximum at the plastic addition ratio of 6 % and then decreases; 2) PS and <b>PET</b> deteriorate the <b>coke</b> strength, observably at the addition ratio of 5 %; and 3) both the coke reactivity and porosity increase {{with the increase of}} addition ratio of waste plastics.

50|$|Many {{refineries}} {{are using}} the lower end residual oil with higher sulphur content to produce more lighter oils (petrol, diesel, etc) by installing petroleum coker units. This process generates a solid fuel called <b>Pet</b> <b>coke</b> which has higher calorific value and sulphur.

40|$|The {{influence}} of ash in chemical-looping combustion (CLC) {{has been studied}} in a lab-scale fluidized bed reactor. The oxygen carrier, ilmenite, was investigated with German lignite coal, Chinese bituminous coal, Mexican <b>pet</b> <b>coke,</b> wood char, and methane. Lignite ash and ash from gasified Chinese bituminous coal were compared in this study. Up to 50 [*]wt[*]% and 33. 3 [*]wt[*]% loadings of ash from the combustion of lignite and ash from the gasification of coal were added. The gas conversion was clearly affected {{by the addition of}} ash, and very similar results were seen both for methane conversion and for CO conversion in the solid fuel tests. Thus, both ashes showed initial decrease in gas conversion with the addition of some ash due to the presence of inert/deactivating material in the ashes.

40|$|Chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) is a combustion concept with inherent {{separation of}} CO 2. The process uses a solid oxygen carrier, {{which consists of}} metal oxide, to transfer the oxygen from air to fuel. The chemical-looping combustor {{used in the present}} experiments features two interconnected fluidized beds; a fuel reactor (FR) and an air reactor (AR). In the FR, fuel is gasified with steam whereupon gasification products react with the oxygen carrier to form, ideally, CO 2 and H 2 O. This study concerns CLC of solid fuels in a continuously operating 10 kW unit using two natural ores as oxygen carrier: (a) ilmenite, an iron–titanium mineral and (b) a manganese ore containing smaller amounts of Fe, Al and Si. The fuel feed was re-designed in order to increase contact between oxygen carrier and fuel. The new in-bed fuel feed was found to significantly improve gas conversion, mainly caused by increased contact between the oxygen carrier and volatile gases released in the fuel chute. Two fuels were used to evaluate the effect of fuel feed; a bituminous coal and a <b>pet</b> <b>coke.</b> The in-bed fuel feed was used when ilmenite and manganese ore were compared. The use of a manganese ore as oxygen carrier was shown to significantly enhance the rate of char gasification and also improve gas conversion.

40|$|The PCI {{technology}} {{is well established}} for reducing the consumption of economic and environmentally expensive coke in blast furnace iron-making. Often, coal blends show unexpected combustion performance which cannot be explained {{on the basis of}} individual coal properties particularly coal rank and volatile matter. Several coals were combusted in this study under controlled conditions in a drop tube furnace. Fixed bed reactor, XRD, SEM and BET analyses were used to understand the mechanism of combustion of coal blends. Burnout of the coal blends did not change linearly with volatile matter of blends. The study demonstrated that combustion behaviour of coal blends was influenced by several properties of individual coals and cannot be estimated by using any single coal parameter. Carbon structure of coal as well as the interaction of volatile matter of individual coals was found to have a strong influence on the burnout of coal blends. Pet-cokes were generally found to burn with a greater difficulty. Carbon structure of pet-cokes was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the burnout such that coal blends with highly ordered pet-coke indicated lower burnout. The study shows that up to 10 % of <b>pet</b> <b>coke</b> did not change the burnout of PCI blends significantly.

CCS must be included in the portfolio of solutions in order to reach the target of world emissions reduction by 50 % in 2050. One of the most relevant European initiatives for the deployment of CCS technologies is promoted by the Fundacion Ciudad de la Energia (CIUDEN). CIUDEN has a complete programme focused on the development of CCT and CCS, particularly oxycombustion technology. This paper includes the description of CIUDEN’s Capture Technology Developing Plant, currently under construction in NW Spain. The installation includes a 20  MWth PC boiler, a 30  MWth CFB boiler, a fuel preparation unit, a biomass gasifier, a flue gas cleaning train, and a CO 2 processing unit.

The present piece of research work is aimed at use of blue dust for production of metallic iron. A newly emerging technology i. e. plasma smelting process is adopted for reduction of blue dust. Blue dust of average particle size about 100 - 150 micron is taken and carbon (<b>pet</b> <b>coke)</b> of 5, 10, 12, 15 and 20 percent is thoroughly mixed, used as feed material.

The degree of metallization, amount of recovery for all samples is measured. Maximum of 86 % recovery and 98 % metallization is achieved. It is observed that use of nitrogen as plasma forming gas increases the rate of recovery than that of argon plasma, due to high energy flux of nitrogen gas which increases the enthalpy due to its diatomicity. The X-ray diffraction analysis shows the presence of ferrite and cementite phases in the smelted product. Variation of microstructure is observed with the samples. The hardness measurement of different phases on the sample ensured the presence of ferrite, pearlite and cementite phases depending on smelting condition...|$|E
