The experimental setup main components are multi-crystalline Photovoltaic (PV) module, battery as a buffer for constant 12 V DC and 50 liter portable refrigerator with/without PCM thermal energy storage. In addition, a theoretical model is established to evaluate the refrigerator performance when operated under different environmental conditions of the design point. Thereafter the model is used to size a larger cooling capacity solar driven refrigerator. The results show that this system {{can be used in}} remote hot arid areas for refrigeration of <b>post-harvest</b> <b>crops</b> transportation <b>activities.</b> From outdoor results at PCM – full load condition, a COP of 1. 22 is achieved and storage temperature of 5 °C is achieved at third day and 0 °C at sixth day...|$|R

40|$|Pseudomonas syringae pv. porri, {{the causal}} agent of {{bacterial}} blight of leek, is a current threat for leek (Allium porrum) {{production in the}} Netherlands. The roles of <b>post-harvest</b> <b>crop</b> waste and plant invasion from soil in leek plant infection was investigated with the purpose to gain better understanding on the ecology and epidemiology of this pathogen. In a survey done over 167 leek fields, P. syringae pv. porri was present in 101 fields. About a tenfold higher P. syringae pv. porri average infection rate was recorded in leek plants from fields where <b>post-harvest</b> <b>crop</b> waste was returned than in those from fields where no waste was returned. P. syringae pv. porri could survive for at least 1 month in shredded plant material made from infected plants (mimicking crop waste in practice). Field experiments done over three successive years revealed that leek plants that were treated with crop waste at the nursery and production growth stages consistently showed higher infection rates than plants that remained untreated. Plants that were treated with crop waste only at one of both stages revealed intermediate infection rates. In a plant-soil microcosm study, it appeared that P. syringae pv. porri strain P 55 R colony numbers in the leek rhizosphere were approximately 4 orders in magnitude higher than in corresponding bulk soils. P. syringae pv. porri was shown to colonize leek roots and cells of the pathogen were also present in the leaves. It was concluded that <b>post-harvest</b> <b>crop</b> waste {{play an important role}} in the epidemiology of P. syringae pv. porri in leek production.

40|$|The {{delivery}} of food security via continued crop yield improvement {{alone is not}} an effective food security strategy, and must be supported by pre- and post-border biosecurity policies to guard against perverse outcomes.

It is not surprising that there is now considerable interest among researchers, growers, and policy makers in developing better pest management technology. Integrated pest management (IPM) technologies which emphasize a variety of cultural, biological, and chemical pest control inputs are currently being developed for many crops.

40|$|Excessive {{softening}} {{of fruits}} during the ripening process leads to deterioration. This is of significant global importance as softening-mediated deterioration leads to huge postharvest losses. N-glycan processing enzymes {{are reported to}} play an important role during climacteric fruit softening: however, to date these enzymes have not been characterized in non-climacteric fruit. Two ripening-specific N-glycan processing enzymes, α-mannosidase (α-Man) and β-D-N-acetylhexosaminidase (β-Hex), have been identified and targeted to enhance the shelf life in non-climacteric fruits such as capsicum (Capsicum annuum). The purification, cloning, and functional characterization of α-Man and β-Hex from capsicum, which belong to glycosyl hydrolase (GH) families 38 and 20, respectively, are described here. α-Man and β-Hex are cell wall glycoproteins that are able to cleave terminal α-mannose and β-D-N-acetylglucosamine residues of N-glycans, respectively. α-Man and β-Hex transcripts as well as enzyme activity increase with the ripening and/or softening of capsicum. The function of α-Man and β-Hex in capsicum softening is investigated through RNA interference (RNAi) in fruits. α-Man and β-Hex RNAi fruits were approximately two times firmer compared with the control and fruit deterioration was delayed by approximately 7 d. It is shown that silencing of α-Man and β-Hex enhances fruit shelf life due to the reduced degradation of N-glycoproteins which resulted in delayed softening. Altogether, the results provide evidence for the involvement of N-glycan processing in non-climacteric fruit softening. In conclusion, genetic engineering of N-glycan processing can be a common strategy in both climacteric and non-climacteric species to reduce the <b>post-harvest</b> <b>crop</b> losses...|$|R

40|$|Diamondback moth or DBM is {{the major}} pest of Brassica {{vegetable}} production worldwide. Control has relied on insecticides, and DBM resistance to these compounds has evolved rapidly. We review and summarize data on DBM population dynamics across a large latitudinal gradient from southwest to northeast China: DBM is, on average, more common in southern locations than in northern locations. The species 2 ̆ 7 phenology is consistent: in southern and central locations there is a decline during hot summer months, while in the north, the species can only exist in the summer following migrations from the south. A cohort-based discrete-time model, driven by daily maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall, which was built using the DYMEX modelling software, captures the age-structured population dynamics of DBM at representative locations, with year round cropping and threshold-based insecticide applications. The scale of the simulated pest problem varies with cropping practices. Local production breaks and strict <b>post-harvest</b> <b>crop</b> hygiene are associated with lower DBM populations. Biological control appears to improve the management of DBM. Of the management strategies explored, non-threshold based applications of insecticides with reduced spray efficacy (due to poor application or resistance) appear the least effective. The model simulates the phenology and abundance patterns in the population dynamics across the climatic gradient in China reasonably well. With planned improvements, and backed by a system of field sampling and weather inputs, it should serve well as a platform for a local pest forecast system, spanning the range of DBM in China, and perhaps elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|This {{study showed}} that in adult Drosophila melanogaster, the type of sugar-either present within the crop lumen or in the bathing {{solution}} of the crop-had no effect on crop muscle contraction. What is important, however, is the volume within the crop lumen. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that exogenous applications of serotonin on crop muscles increases both the amplitude {{and the frequency of}} crop contraction rate, while adipokinetic hormone mainly enhances the crop contraction frequency. Conversely, octopamine virtually silenced the overall <b>crop</b> <b>activity.</b> The present study reports for the first time an analysis of serotonin effects along the gut-brain axis in adult D. melanogaster. Injection of serotonin into the brain between the interocellar area shows that brain applications of serotonin decrease the frequency of <b>crop</b> <b>activity.</b> Based on our results, we propose that there are two different, opposite pathways for crop motility control governed by serotonin: excitatory when added in the abdomen (i. e., directly bathing the crop) and inhibitory when supplied within the brain (i. e., by injection). Finally, our results point to a double brain-gut serotonergic circuitry suggesting that not only the brain can affect gut functions, but the gut can also affect the central nervous system. On the basis of our results, and data in the literature, a possible mechanism for these two discrete serotonergic functions is suggested...|$|R

Ten large {{conglomerates}} account for over 70 % {{of the bad}} forest and estate crop debt. These groups are also responsible for some US$ 2. 4 billion in domestic nonperforming loans in other sectors and US$ 15 billion in offshore debt. The current high level of non-performing loans stems, in large part, from the failure by banks to exercise due diligence (i. e., seriously assess the potential for loan default) when Indonesia’s forest-linked conglomerates sought to borrow funds prior to the crisis. Direct government subsidies for forest and estate <b>crop</b> <b>activities</b> also encouraged corporate risk taking. Strong evidence suggests that debt write-offs and loan restructuring may provide Indonesia’s forest-related industries with a substantial capital subsidy. This study projects that IBRA will eventually write-off US$ 1. 3 – 1. 9 billion of debts associated with timber, wood processing, pulp and paper, and oil palm investments. Debt write-off on this scale, together with IBRA’s current lack of supervision over the forest-related companies that owe it large sums of money, will serve as an impetus for debtor firms to continue to engage in practices involving an inordinate degree of financial risk...|$|R
