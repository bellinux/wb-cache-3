Mr. Burns is so {{impressed}} that he hires Homer on the spot. When Homer returns to Marge's house, he discovers from Jacqueline that she has gone into labor and is already at the hospital. He quickly gets there and sees Marge with Selma and an angry Patty, who starts berating him. Fed up with her disrespect, Homer lashes out at Patty and angrily tells Patty (as well {{as the rest of the}} Bouvier family) to start showing him some respect for he has a job, a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>news</b> that Homer promptly tells Marge before she finally gives birth to Bart. After Homer finishes telling his flashback story, he admits to Bart that he received the greatest gift a man can have the day Bart was born.

Thus, Sun Quan grudgingly withdrew; {{in order to avoid}} being infected, Sun only had 1,000 troops with him on the northern part of Xiaoyao Ford (逍遥津). This <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>news</b> was received by Zhang Liao, who immediately led several thousand elite cavalry to pursue the enemy commander. During the chaos, Sun Quan was nearly killed if not saved by his general Ling Tong, and the siege of Hefei came to a complete victory for Cao Cao's side.

25|$|A slew of {{centrality}} measures {{exist to}} determine the ‘importance’ of a single node in a complex network. However, these measures quantify {{the importance of a}} node in purely topological terms, and the value of the node does not depend on the ‘state’ of the node in any way. It remains constant regardless of network dynamics. This is true even for the weighted betweenness measures. However, a node may very well be centrally located in terms of betweenness centrality or another centrality measure, but may not be ‘centrally’ located {{in the context of a}} network in which there is percolation. Percolation of a ‘contagion’ occurs in complex networks in a number of scenarios. For example, viral or bacterial infection can spread over social networks of people, known as contact networks. The spread of disease can also be considered at a higher level of abstraction, by contemplating a network of towns or population centres, connected by road, rail or air links. Computer viruses can spread over computer networks. Rumours or news about business offers and deals can also spread via social networks of people. In all of these scenarios, a ‘contagion’ spreads over the links of a complex network, altering the ‘states’ of the nodes as it spreads, either recoverably or otherwise. For example, in an epidemiological scenario, individuals go from ‘susceptible’ to ‘infected’ state as the infection spreads. The states the individual nodes can take in the above examples could be binary (such as received/not received a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>news),</b> discrete (susceptible/infected/recovered), or even continuous (such as the proportion of infected people in a town), as the contagion spreads. The common feature in all these scenarios is that the spread of contagion results in the change of node states in networks. Percolation centrality (PC) was proposed with this in mind, which specifically measures the importance of nodes in terms of aiding the percolation through the network. This measure was proposed by Piraveenan et al.|$|E

By February 5, six militia units, consisting of 1,000 men, with a guarantee that the numbers could be increased to 5,000 if the situations deemed it necessary, had assembled in Little Rock.

[...] He said although the American administrations had been at best indifferent about terrorist operations in Iran (since 1979), the Iranians instead felt differently and had expressed their sympathetic feelings with bereaved Americans in the tragic incidents in the two cities. He also stated that [...] "Nations should not be punished in place of terrorists." [...] According to Radio Farda's website, when the attacks' news was released, some Iranian citizens gathered in front of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran, which serves as the protecting power of the United States in Iran (US interests protecting office in Iran), to express their sympathy and some of them lit candles as a symbol of mourning. This <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>news</b> at Radio Farda's website also states that in 2011, on the anniversary of the attacks, United States Department of State, published a post at its blog, in which the Department thanked Iranian people for their sympathy and stated that they would never forget Iranian people's kindness on those harsh days. After the attacks, both the President and the Supreme Leader of Iran, condemned the attacks. The BBC and Time magazine published reports on holding candlelit vigils for the victims by Iranian citizens at their websites. According to Politico Magazine, following the attacks, Sayyed Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, [...] "suspended the usual 'Death to America' chants at Friday prayers" [...] temporarily.|$|E

Her act featured the songs [...] "The Tiddly Wink", [...] "I'd Like to Live in Paris All the Time (The Coster Girl in Paris)", and [...] "The Aviator". The numbers were popular, {{partly due to}} the Americanisation of each song's lyrics. On a personal level, Lloyd's time in America was miserable and was made worse by the increasing domestic abuse she received from Dillon. [...] The assaults caused her to miss several key performances, which angered the theatre manager, Edward Albee, who threatened her with a breach of contract action. [...] She claimed that illness made it difficult for her to perform and protested at her billing position. The theatrical press were not convinced. The New York Telegraph speculated [...] "In vaudeville circles her domestic relations are thought to be at the bottom of her attacks of disposition."

40|$|This article {{describes}} the main visual characteristics used in different multimodal <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>news</b> related to immigrant minors in the newspaper El País, {{which is one of}} the most important newspapers in Spain.

For the framework of analysis, the study draws on visual grammar and critical discourse analysis. The study reveals that immigrant minors are represented dysphemistically in the multimodal texts analysed so that the most pejorative side of their reality is portrayed. The author thus aims to provide a visual analysis of the way in which immigrant minors are represented visually in a serious Spanish newspaper. In doing so, she aims to show visual ways of manipulation and reinforcing of stereotypes related to immigrants, in general, and immigrant minors in particular...|$|R

For example, Chouliaraki argues that the [...] "bombardment of Baghdad in 2003 during the Iraq war was filmed in long-shot and presented in a quasiliterary narrative that capitalized on an aesthetics of horror, on sublime spectacle (Boltanski). She says that the [...] "aestheticization {{of suffering}} on television is thus produced by a visual and linguistic complex that eliminates the human pain aspect of suffering, whilst retaining the phantasmagoric effects of a tableau vivant", producing an [...] "aestheticization of suffering [...] manages simultaneously to preserve an aura of objectivity and impartiality, and to take a pro-war side in the war footage".|$|E
2500|$|Usually {{talent is}} {{secondary}} {{to the success of}} a Cantopop singer in Hong Kong.

Publicity is vital to an idol's career, as one <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>news</b> could make or break a future. [...] Almost all modern Cantopop stars go into the movie business regardless of their ability to act; however the reverse may also occur with actors releasing albums and embarking on concerts regardless of singing talent. They immediately expand to the Mandarin market once their fame is established, hence pure Cantopop stars are almost nonexistent. Outside of the music sales, their success can also be gauged by their income. For example, according to some reports, Sammi Cheng earned HK$46M (around US$6M) from advertisement and merchandise endorsements in one month alone. Many artists however begin with financial hardships. [...] For example, Yumiko Cheng owed her company thousands of dollars. [...] Others include Elanne Kong crying in public with only HK$58 left.|$|E

It can be defined as selection and hierarchization of information and determination of its value. Aggregation can be performed with the direct participation of editorial teams, or it can be performed automatically, with the use of algorithms. The research conducted in April 2014 - April 2015 was to indicate the sources of information published by the news portals dominating on the Polish market, namely: Onet. pl and WP. pl. The research referred to the main section Wiadomosci (News). During the research 1829 sources of information were identified in Onet. pl and 2272 sources of information in WP. pl. Considering Onet. pl, there were 549 <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> the portal <b>news</b> and 1239 <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>news</b> obtained from different sources. WP. pl presented 582 <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> the portal <b>news</b> and 1690 <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>news</b> received from other sources. Thus, Onet. pl presented its original content more frequently. The scale of using external sources allows us to state that both portals are, first of all, the aggregators of medial contents, and they use external information sources, however the scale of the practice is differentiated. Generally, it is possible to state that only every third message placed in the most important section of both portals was created in their editorial offices...|$|R
