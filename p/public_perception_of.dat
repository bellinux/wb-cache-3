5|$|Laws {{have been}} passed {{in many areas of}} the world to protect bears from habitat destruction. <b>Public</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> bears is often positive, as people {{identify}} with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance. Support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies. Where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans. In poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers.|$|E

40|$|The {{damaging}} {{effects of}} human activities on marine health {{suggest that a}} major shift is required in the way marine systems are used by individuals. Identifying how to engage society in this shift is an ongoing debate. This includes strengthening the positive connections between society and the sea. This study uses a survey (n¼ 1047) to investigate UK <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> subtidal species and marine health to assess whether {{it is possible to}} build more positive connections between society and the sea. Respondents showed considerable interest in traditionally charismatic species (puffins, seals and seahorses) although many respondents thought these species did not live in UK seas. Gender and experience of marine environments influenced <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> species. <b>Public</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> marine health showed issues such as litter to be considered as the greatest indicator of poor health. Ecological concepts of habitat integrity and biodiversity were also rated as important to marine health. Social values were found to influence <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> marine health. The results show that perceptions are far from uniform across the population, and such diversity <b>of</b> <b>perceptions</b> is likely impact upon methods to catalyse societal engagement with marine conservation. These findings reinforce previous research on <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> UK seas, and identify opportunities for building positive connections between society and the sea. Research priorities to further the debate of engaging society with the sea are identified...|$|R

5|$|The {{submarines}} {{have been}} the subject of many incidents and technical problems since the design phase, including accusations of foul play and bias during the design selection, improper handling of design changes during construction, major capability deficiencies in the first submarines, and ongoing technical problems throughout the early life of the class. These problems have been compounded by the inability of the RAN to retain sufficient personnel to operate the submarines—by 2008, only three could be manned, and between 2009 and 2012, on average two or fewer were fully operational. The resulting negative press has led to a poor <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the Collins class.|$|E

In parallel, visions about the public held by actors engaged in the GMO {{controversy}} were also studied through interviews, participant observation and document analysis. In addition {{to the value of}} the results obtained separately from members of the public and from the actors, the comparison of these two components sheds new light on the subject <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> risk. The results suggest the persistence of a certain number of myths about the public which are shared among numerous actors but which are not supported by our analysis of the expression of citizens in the focus groups...|$|R
5|$|Elizabeth Bear's Carnival (2006) revisits the trope of the single-gender world, {{as a pair}} of {{gay male}} ambassador-spies attempt to {{infiltrate}} and subvert the predominately lesbian civilization of New Amazonia, whose matriarchal rulers have all but enslaved their men. In 2007, J.K. Rowling's statement that Albus Dumbledore, a character in her Harry Potter series, was gay caused some controversy. Sarah Hall's dystopian novel The Carhullan Army (2007), published in the US under the title Daughters of the North, matter of factly features lesbians as primary characters. The novel won the 2007 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and was shortlisted for the 2008 Arthur C. Clarke Award.

5|$|Following the McIntosh-Prescott Report, which {{indicated}} the long-term faults {{with the class}} that still required solving, successful {{efforts were made to}} bring the submarines to operational standard. As part of this, a public relations plan was implemented to provide up-to-date information on the submarines to the media, to improve the <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the class by providing factual information on the status of the project and responding to queries and incidents. This same period saw the dispelling of the idea, widely held within the RAN, that the Collins-class boats would be like any other vessel previously ordered by the RAN: in service with another navy, well tested, and with all the problems solved before they entered Australian hands. The RAN began to realise that as the parent navy for the class, they had a greater responsibility than normal in ensuring that the boats were at an operational standard.|$|E
5|$|The Drexler–Smalley {{debate on}} {{molecular}} nanotechnology {{was a public}} dispute between K. Eric Drexler, the originator of the conceptual basis of molecular nanotechnology, and Richard Smalley, a recipient of the 1996 Nobel prize in Chemistry for {{the discovery of the}} nanomaterial buckminsterfullerene. The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing molecular assemblers, which are molecular machines which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of molecular nanotechnology, but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} also {{considered}} {{a sign of}} the arrival of the Jet age, the Il-10, which had been considered a high quality and effective conventional aircraft in World War II had been easily outmatched by the F-80 and its jet engine. The engagement was a rare example of an air-to-air battle at the early phase of the war, and North Korean forces became much more cautious when deploying their aircraft in battle, knowing they were easily outnumbered and outmatched by UN forces. For the next several months, the UN forces enjoyed air supremacy, operating their air forces in support of ground combat virtually unopposed. The <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the F-80s, which had to this point been cautious, improved with news of the victories.|$|E
5|$|Grey-headed {{flying foxes}} {{are exposed to}} several threats, {{including}} loss of foraging and roosting habitat, competition with the black flying fox, and mass die-offs caused by extreme temperature events. When present in urban environments, grey-headed flying foxes are sometimes perceived as a nuisance. Cultivated orchard fruits are also taken, but apparently only at times when other food items are scarce. Because their roosting and foraging habits bring the species into conflict with humans, they suffer from direct killing of animals in orchards and harassment and destruction of roosts. Negative <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the species has intensified {{with the discovery of}} three recently emerged zoonotic viruses that are potentially fatal to humans: Hendra virus, Australian bat lyssavirus and Menangle virus. However, only Australian bat lyssavirus is known from two isolated cases to be directly transmissible from bats to humans. No person has ever died from ABLV (Lyssavirus) after having had the ABLV post-exposure vaccine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Public</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the {{national}} flag varies. Historically, both Western and Japanese sources claimed the flag {{was a powerful}} and enduring symbol to the Japanese. Since the end of World War II (the Pacific War), {{the use of the}} flag and {{the national}} anthem Kimigayo has been a contentious issue for Japan's public schools. Disputes about their use have led to protests and lawsuits. The flag is not frequently displayed in Japan due to its association with ultranationalism. To Okinawans, the flag represents the events of World WarII and the subsequent U.S. military presence there. For some nations that have been occupied by Japan, the flag is a symbol of aggression and imperialism. The Hi no maru was used as a tool against occupied nations for purposes of intimidation, asserting Japan's dominance, or subjugation. Several military banners of Japan are based on the Hi no maru, including the sunrayed Naval Ensign. The Hi no maru also serves as a template for other Japanese flags in public and private use.|$|E
