5|$|The Chinese Indonesian {{population}} of Sumatra accounts {{for nearly half}} of the group's national population. Although they are generally more urbanized than Indonesia's indigenous population, significant rural and agricultural communities exist throughout the country. Declining fertility rates have resulted in an upward shift in the <b>population</b> <b>pyramid,</b> as the median age increases. Emigration has contributed to a shrinking population, and communities have emerged in more industrialized nations {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. Some have participated in repatriation programs to the People's Republic of China, while others emigrated to Western countries to escape anti-Chinese sentiment. Among the overseas residents, their identities are noticeably more Indonesian than Chinese.|$|E
5|$|The ethnic Chinese {{population}} in Indonesia grew {{by an average}} of 4.3 percent annually between 1920 and 1930. It then slowed owing to the effects of the Great Depression and many areas experienced a net emigration. Falling growth rates were also attributed to a significant {{decrease in the number of}} Chinese immigrants admitted into Indonesia since the 1950s. The population is relatively old according to the 2000 census, having the lowest percentage of population under 14 years old nationwide and the second-highest percentage of population over 65. Their <b>population</b> <b>pyramid</b> had a narrow base with a rapid increase until the 15–19 age group, indicating a rapid decline in total fertility rates. This was evidenced by a decline in the absolute number of births since 1980. In Jakarta and West Java the population peak occurred in the 20–24 age group, indicating that the decline in fertility rates began as early as 1975. The upper portion of the pyramid exhibited a smooth decline with increasing population age. It is estimated that 60.7 percent of the Chinese Indonesian {{population in}} 2000 constitute the generation which experienced political and social pressures under the New Order government. With an average life expectancy of 75 years, those who spent their formative years prior to this regime will completely disappear by 2032.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of the Central Visayas is predominantly young with about 37 percent of its population below 10 years old. This is very evident in the very broad base of the <b>population</b> <b>pyramid</b> in the region which has prevailed since 1970 but at a declining rate. A decline of 2.29 percentage points {{in the proportion of}} household population below 15 years old was noted from 1980 to 1995. Conversely, an increase of 3.06 percentage points was observed in the 15–64 age group during the same period. The {{population of}} the region is evenly distributed between male and female. However, the male population in the region has been increasing at a faster rate compared to the female population.|$|E

25|$|The ageing of Europe, {{also known}} as the greying of Europe, is a {{demographic}} phenomenon in Europe characterized by a decrease in fertility, a decrease in mortality rate, and a higher life expectancy among European populations. Low birth rates and higher life expectancy contribute to the transformation of Europe's <b>population</b> <b>pyramid</b> shape. The most significant change is the transition towards a much older population structure, resulting in a decrease in the proportion of the working age while the number of the retired population increases. The total number of the older population is projected to increase greatly within the coming decades, with rising proportions of the post-war baby-boom generations reaching retirement. This will cause a high burden on the working age population as they provide for the increasing number of the older population.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} decade, Philadelphia {{experienced}} a large shift in its age profile. In 2000, the city's <b>population</b> <b>pyramid</b> had a largely stationary shape. In 2013, the city {{took on an}} expansive pyramid shape, {{with an increase in}} the three millennial age groups, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, and 30 to 34. The city's 25- to 29-year-old age group was the city's largest age cohort. According to the 2010 Census, 343,837 (22.5%) were under the age of 18; 203,697 (13.3%) from 18 to 25; 434,385 (28.5%) from 25 to 44; 358,778 (23.5%) from 45 to 64; and 185,309 (12.1%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33.5 years. For every 100 females there were 89.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.7 males. The city had 22,018 births in 2013, down from a peak 23,689 births in 2008. Philadelphia's death rate was at its lowest in at least a half-century, 13,691 deaths in 2013. Another factor attributing to the population increase is Philadelphia's immigration rate. In 2013, 12.7 percent of residents were foreign-born, just shy of the national average, 13.1 percent.|$|E

40|$|Tobacco {{smoking and}} obesity greatly {{contribute}} to premature death and disease in developed countries. In order {{to measure the}} extent to which these risk factors affect a population, as well as to describe the progression of these epidemics over time, routine surveillance of the prevalence of obesity and smoking is carried out by international organizations, national departments of health, and statistical offices. To this end, summary measures—like age-standardized rates, and tabular and graphical representations, such as maps—are used. In this study, we argue that <b>population</b> <b>pyramids,</b> a widely used demographic tool, may be easily adapted to provide relevant visual information for public health purposes. By means of two juxtaposed histograms, one for each gender, <b>population</b> <b>pyramids</b> show either the proportion or the actual number of subjects in each age and gender subgroup. We suggest that stratifying each bar of the two histograms according to ordinal categories of the health condition or risk factor examined may provide useful details on the relationship between this condition or factor and key demographic variables like age and gender. In addition, the actual number of exposed subjects can be immediately read from the graph. We therefore built a statistical routine with Stata to create modified population-pyramid plots separately for overweight/obese and current/former smoker. Data were derived from five National Health Interview Surveys carried out in Italy between 1983 and 2005. For each survey, data on age, gender, smoking status, height, and weight were extracted for subjects aged 20 – 99. Age and gender-specific prevalence rates of overweight/obese, and of current/former/never smoker were computed and applied to population estimates performed by the Italian national statistical institute (ISTAT). The resulting estimated numbers of underweight/normal weight/overweight/obese individuals and of former/current/never smokers were used to create the modified <b>population</b> <b>pyramids.</b> In conclusion, modified <b>population</b> <b>pyramids</b> may contribute to assessing the impact of risk factors on a population in absolute terms, to evaluating how these risk factors are distributed by age and gender, and to assessing how the age and gender distribution of these risk factors changes over time. ...|$|R

40|$|Functional Data Analysis {{deals with}} samples where a whole {{function}} is observed for each individual. A relevant case of FDA {{is when the}} observed functions are density functions. Among the particular characteristics of density functions, {{the most of the}} fact that they are an example of infinite dimensional compositional data (parts of some whole which only carry relative information) is made. Several dimensionality reduction methods for this particular type of data are compared: functional principal components analysis with or without a previous data transformation, and multidimensional scaling for different inter-density distances, one of them taking into account the compositional nature of density functions. The emphasis is on the steps previous and posterior to the application of a particular dimensionality reduction method: care must be taken in choosing the right density function transformation and/or the appropriate distance between densities before performing dimensionality reduction; subsequently the graphical representation of dimensionality reduction results must take into account that the observed objects are density functions. The different methods are applied 1 to artificial and real data (<b>population</b> <b>pyramids</b> for 223 countries in year 2000). As a global conclusion, the use of multidimensional scaling based on compositional distance is recommended.

40|$|Probability density {{functions}} are frequently used {{to characterize the}} distributional properties of large-scale database systems.
