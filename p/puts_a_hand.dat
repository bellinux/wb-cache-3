5000|$|Krillin {{has many}} {{abilities}} including, super-strength, super-speed, {{and the ability}} to fly using his ki energy, known as Bukū-jutsu (lit. [...] "Air Dance Technique"). His main techniques include the Kamehameha (lit. [...] "Turtle Destruction Wave"), an attack he learned from Master Roshi, which enables him to emit a powerful ki energy blast from his hands. Kakusandan (lit. [...] "Scattershots"), another chi attack, involves firing two blasts, one from each hand, and merging them before directing the blast above an opponent where it will break up and rain down on them, he was only seen using this twice—the first time was very successful as he managed to wipe out three Saibamen with it. From Tenshinhan, he obtained the Taiyōken (lit. [...] "Solar Fist", renamed [...] "Solar Flare" [...] in the English anime dub), an attack Krillin is capable of using to blind his opponents, sometimes used to make a quick escape. One of his signature techniques is the Kienzan (lit. [...] "Energy Disc Razor", renamed [...] "Destructo Disc" [...] in the English anime dub), where he <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> in the air to create an electric floating disc, using it to slice through his enemies. Lacking the other protagonists' advantage of getting stronger every time he is injured, Krillin is however the strongest Earthling and was recognized as having great technique by Vegeta.|$|E

40|$|Thank you {{for your}} order, Mr Mainframe Customer.  The cost is £ 5 million and the {{lead-time}} for manufacture will be two years. In the meantime {{you will have to}} build a special computer centre to our specification. For our part, our project team will help you recruit and train potential programmers and we shall advise on how you might use the system. ’ How different from today when the customer will want to see a specific application running before he <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> in his/her pocket. Chris Yardley lived the changes as a computer salesman and tells his story of a career living and working in five countries. Warts and all. The ecstasies, the heartbreaks and idiocies of major corporations. His career was not a planned one. In a growing industry, opportunities presented themselves and Chris believes he grasped every one presented. Having written his story, he has had every chapter verified by at least one person who features in that narrative. His respondents have universally endorsed the facts with comments such as ‘Wow, I’d forgotten most of that’. ‘You have a fantastic memory. ’ ‘I never knew before the full facts of what happened. ’ ‘How have you remembered all the circumstances?’ ‘It really is a people business. ’ This is the only book that has followed a computer sales career over almost 50 years...|$|E
