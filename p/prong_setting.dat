5000|$|<b>Prong</b> <b>setting</b> or prong mount {{refers to}} the use of metal {{projections}} or tines, called prongs, to secure a gemstone to a piece of jewelry. A <b>prong</b> <b>setting</b> is one component of what is known to jewelers as a head, a claw-shaped type of binding (typically 3, 4, or 6 individual prongs per head) that is welded or soldered to a jewelry item in order to mount (or set) a gemstone to the jewelry item. [...] A common setting for diamond engagement rings, the <b>prong</b> <b>setting</b> allows light to strike a gemstone from more angles, increasing its brilliance.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Prong</b> <b>setting</b> {{engagement}} {{rings are}} {{sometimes referred to}} as Tiffany setting rings, although this is a trademarked term specifically used to describe <b>prong</b> <b>setting</b> rings sold by Tiffany & Co. A 2017 $19 million lawsuit confirmed the exclusive right of Tiffany & Co. to utilize the term [...] "Tiffany" [...] within the the jewlery sales industry.|$|E
5000|$|One {{well-known}} <b>prong</b> <b>setting</b> is the [...] "Tiffany setting", a trademarked {{engagement ring}} design created by Charles Tiffany in the 1880s {{that has become}} the signature line of Tiffany & Co. engagement rings. [...] The Tiffany setting popularized the general use of <b>prong</b> <b>setting</b> engagement rings, and as of 2012, the trade association Jewelers of America reports that multi-prong solitare rings are the most sought-after form of engagement ring available.|$|E
25|$|A {{great deal}} of speculation, along with claims and refutations, dealt {{with the number of}} Ethiopian forces {{involved}} in the war. According to an estimate by Rome-based Globe Research, Ethiopian forces around Baidoa were estimated to number about a division of 12,000 soldiers. Baidoa airport hosted a squadron of helicopters, and was being expanded by Ethiopian engineers to accommodate fighter aircraft. New radar was being installed. A second division of light infantry was being positioned against Beledweyne. A third <b>prong</b> was <b>set</b> to advance on Kismayo.|$|R
2500|$|Although Townsend {{sold his}} Little River tract to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park Commission in 1926, {{he did so}} with the {{agreement}} that he could continue logging {{in the area for}} 15 years. [...] After logging operations had commenced at Elkmont in 1925, Townsend ordered the tracks to be pulled up and moved to Middle Prong. [...] A base for the Middle <b>Prong</b> operation was <b>set</b> up at the junction of Lynn Camp Prong and Thunderhead Prong. [...] This base quickly grew into a small town, which was given the name Tremont, a combination of [...] "tree" [...] and [...] "mountain." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{setting of}} gemstones {{utilizes}} basic categories of styles and techniques, including; <b>prong</b> <b>setting,</b> bezel setting, channel setting and bead setting.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>prong</b> <b>setting</b> offers less {{protection}} to the gem than inset mounts. [...] In addition, prongs can snag on clothing or fabric. [...] High quality settings {{are less likely}} to snag on clothing, as the prongs are firmly attached to the gem and well finished.|$|E
50|$|One {{advantage}} of the bezel setting {{as compared to the}} <b>prong</b> <b>setting</b> is that the diamond is better protected from accidental rubbing or blows, and is less likely to allow the diamond to scratch or mar something it comes in contact with. The bezel setting is also more secure, so the diamond is less likely to be dislodged by the wearer's activity.|$|E
5000|$|While some in {{the jewelry}} {{industry}} use the term [...] "Tiffany setting" [...] to describe multi-prong solitaire rings, the Tiffany setting is a specific trademarked design of Tiffany & Co. [...] In February 2013 Tiffany & Co. filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Costco Wholesale Corp. over Costco's practice of selling <b>prong</b> <b>setting</b> engagement rings described as [...] "Tiffany setting" [...] rings. The lawsuit alleged that Costco was unlawfully using the [...] "Tiffany" [...] trademark to describe products that were not made or licensed by Tiffany & Co. In its defense, Costco asserted {{that it did not}} infringe because the terms [...] "Tiffany" [...] and [...] "Tiffany setting" [...] were genericized by common usage to describe <b>prong</b> <b>setting</b> engagement ring. [...] However, on September 8, 2015, a federal judge ruled in favor of Tiffany & Co., rejecting Costco's generic use argument and finding that Costco's usage of the [...] "Tiffany" [...] name violated Tiffany & Co.'s trademark rights.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, where {{engagement}} {{rings are}} worn by women, diamonds {{have been widely}} featured in engagement rings {{since the middle of}} the 20th century. Solitaire rings have one single diamond. The most common setting for engagement rings is the solitaire <b>prong</b> <b>setting,</b> which was popularized by Tiffany & Co. in 1886 and its six-claw <b>prong</b> <b>setting</b> design sold under the [...] "Tiffany setting" [...] trademark. The modern favorite cut for an engagement ring is the brilliant cut, which provides the maximum amount of sparkle to the gemstone. The traditional engagement rings may have different prong settings and bands. Another major category is engagement rings with side stones. Rings with a larger diamond set in the middle and smaller diamonds on the side fit under this category. Three-stone diamond engagement rings, sometimes called trinity rings or trilogy rings, are rings with three matching diamonds set horizontally in a row with the bigger stone placed in the center. The three diamonds on the ring are typically said to represent the couple's past, present, and future, but other people give religious significance to the arrangement.|$|E
50|$|Bezel {{settings}} for diamond rings are also called rub-over settings; {{they have a}} diamond completely surrounded by a precious metal band which fastens the diamond securely into place. Bezel settings use a type of elevated collar which wraps {{the rim of the}} diamond in a complete metal edging. This type of diamond rings setting is the most secure fastener for the stones. The bezel setting also protects the diamond better than other types of settings, such as the <b>prong</b> <b>setting.</b> A flush setting for diamond rings is a variation on the rub-over or bezel setting. In the flush setting, the stone is placed into an opening and affixed {{at the bottom of the}} stone. The top of the diamond is extended above the base.|$|E
5000|$|The head can be handmade, cast or die struck, {{and it is}} {{made from}} some type of {{precious}} metal, such as gold, silver and platinum. Heads used to prong set a gemstone {{come in a variety}} of sizes and shapes, depending on the shape of the gemstone, the size of the gemstone, or whether or not the gemstone is faceted or cabochon shaped. Common shapes of heads used in stone setting include round, oval, emerald cut, princess cut, marquise cut, pear shaped and trillian cut. V-shaped prongs are recommended for a marquise-cut or pear-shaped stone, while flat prongs are recommended for a flat-cut emerald. [...] A <b>prong</b> <b>setting</b> holds the gem securely while allowing the gem to be struck with more light and from more angles, increasing the brilliance of the gemstone.|$|E
50|$|The setting {{diamonds}} {{are placed}} in also affect the performance of light through a diamond. The three most commonly used settings are: Prong, Bezel, and Channel. Prong settings {{are the most popular}} setting for diamond jewelry. The <b>prong</b> <b>setting</b> consists of four or six 'claws' that cradle the diamond, allowing the maximum amount of light to enter from all angles, allowing the diamonds to appear larger and more brilliant. In bezel settings the diamond or gemstone is completely surrounded by a rim of metal, which can be molded into any shape to accommodate the stone. Used to set earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and rings, bezel settings can have open or closed backs, and generally can be molded to allow a lot of light to pass through. Channel settings set the stones right next to each other with no metal separating them. This setting is mostly used in wedding and anniversary bands. The outer ridge is then worked over the edges of the stones to create a smooth exterior surface. This also protects the girdle area of the stone.|$|E
5000|$|Channel {{setting is}} a method whereby stones are {{suspended}} between two bars or strips of metal, called channels. Often when setting small stones and the bars go in a line with the design it is called channel setting, and when the bars cross {{the lines of the}} design, it is called bar set. The idea is the same, though. The channel is some variation of a [...] "U" [...] shape, with two sides and a bottom. The sides are made just a bit narrower than the width of the stone or stones to be set, and then, using the same burs as in <b>prong</b> <b>setting,</b> a small notch, which is again called a bearing, is cut into each wall. The stone is put in place in those notches, and the metal on top is pushed down, tightening the stone in place. The proper way to set a channel is to cut a notch for each stone, but for cheaper production work sometimes a groove is cut along each channel. Also, since the metal can be very stiff and strong, this is a situation where a reciprocating hammer, which is like a jackhammer but jewelry sized, might be used to hammer down the metal, as {{it can be difficult to}} do by hand. Then, as always, the metal is filed down and finished, and the inner edge near the stones cleaned up and straightened as necessary. As with all jewelry, there can be many variations of channel work. At times the walls will be raised—sometimes a center stone will be set between two bars that rise high from the base ring—or the channel might just be cut directly into some surface, making the stones flush with the metal. It is still channel setting, though.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Prong</b> <b>setting</b> is the {{simplest}} and {{most common type of}} setting, largely because it uses the least amount of metal to hold the stone, thus showing it off to its best advantage. Generally it is simply some number of wires, called prongs, which are of a certain size and shape, arranged in a shape and size to hold the given stone, and fixed at the base. Then a burr of the proper size, is used to cut what is known as a [...] "bearing", which is a notch that corresponds to the angles of the stone. The burr most often used is called a [...] "hart bur" [...] that is angled and sized for the job of setting diamonds. That bearing is cut equally into all of the prongs and at the same height above the base. Then the stone is inserted so that it goes into all of the bearings, pliers or a pusher are used to bend the prongs gently over the crown of the stone, and the tops of the prongs are clipped off with snips, filed to an even height above the stone, and finished. Usually a [...] "cup burr" [...] is used to give the prong a nice round tip. A cup burr is {{in the shape of a}} hemisphere with teeth on the inside, for making rounded tips on wires and prongs. There are many variations of prong settings including just two prongs, the common 4 prongs or up to 24 or more with many variations involving decoration, size and shapes of the prongs themselves, and how they are fixed or used in jewelry. But the method of setting is generally the same for all of them no matter how many prongs are present.|$|E
5000|$|A tie pin (or tiepin, {{also known}} as a stick pin/stickpin) is a neckwear-controlling device, {{originally}} worn by wealthy English gentlemen to secure the folds of their cravats. They were first popularized {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century. Cravats were made of silk, satin, lace and lightly starched cambric, lawn and muslin, and stickpins were necessary accoutrements to keep these expensive fabrics in place and safe. Stickpins commonly used pearls and other precious gemstones set in gold or other precious metals and were designed specifically for their owners. By the 1860s, wearing cravats had been embraced by the English upper middle classes with a consequently lower quality of materials and designs used in both the neckwear and in the stickpins used to keep it in place. By the 1870s Americans had embraced stickpins and designs were mass-produced and included animal heads, horse shoes, knife and fork motifs, crossed pipes, wishbones, bugs, flowers, shields and a host of other figural motifs. By the 1890s stickpins had crossed gender lines as women began wearing them with sporting outfits worn for bicycling, boating, riding, tennis and golf. The Ascot, Four in Hand, Sailor scarf, cravat bow tie and wrapped scarf all became popular for both men and women, and all could be set off with an [...] stickpin. Between 1894 and 1930 many patents were issued covering such issues as <b>prong</b> <b>setting,</b> ornament attachment, stickpin blanks, safety clutches, guards and decorations. One patent was for a brooch which could convert the center medallion to a stickpin. Another concealed a small lead pencil point attached to the shaft of the pin. Still another included a small water reservoir behind the ornamental head of the stick pin in which a flower blossom could be placed. Patent 1,301,568 dated April 22, 1919 was for a luminous stickpin with a star motif disk-like head which held a small drop of radioactive material.|$|E
30|$|Micro-FTIR {{analysis}} was performed on two similar pale red coating samples taken from a colorless stone and its <b>prong</b> <b>setting</b> at the upper p.r. corner of the bow on the p.r. shoe. Cellulose nitrate was identified as the coating (Fig.  16 in Appendix), but the red colorant was not identified. The presence of this red coating confirms that this colorless stone was added as a repair and subsequently painted red to match original stones.|$|E
