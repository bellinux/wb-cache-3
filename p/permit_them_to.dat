5|$|During the war, Napoli and {{her three}} sisters were {{assigned}} to the 2nd Division. They spent much of the war rotating between the bases at Taranto, Brindisi, and Valona, but did not see combat. On 1415 May 1917, three light cruisers of the Austro-Hungarian Navy raided the Otranto Barrage; in the ensuring Battle of the Strait of Otranto, Napoli and her sisters raised steam to assist the Allied warships, but the Italian commander refused to <b>permit</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> join the battle for fear of risking their loss in the submarine-infested Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|Italy {{declared}} neutrality {{after the}} outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter {{the war against the}} Central Powers. The primary naval opponent {{for the duration of the}} war was the Austro-Hungarian Navy; the Naval Chief of Staff, Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, believed the threat from submarines in the confined waters of the Adriatic was too serious to permit an active fleet policy. He therefore planned a distant blockade with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats conducted raids. The heavy ships of the Italian fleet would be preserved for a potential major battle in the event that the Austro-Hungarian fleet should emerge from its bases. As a result, the ship's career during the war was limited. During the war, Regina Elena and her three sisters were assigned to the 2nd Division. They spent much of the war rotating between the bases at Taranto, Brindisi, and Valona, but did not see combat. On 1415 May 1917, three light cruisers of the Austro-Hungarian Navy raided the Otranto Barrage; in the ensuring Battle of the Strait of Otranto, Regina Elena and her sisters raised steam to assist the Allied warships, but the Italian commander refused to <b>permit</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> join the battle for fear of risking their loss in the submarine-infested Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|When the Partisans {{advanced}} into Serbia in March 1944, Partisan {{forces in}} northern Montenegro and the Sandžak {{were reduced to}} one division. To exploit this weakness, Đurišić proposed to the Germans that they launch an offensive operation. Operation Frühlingserwachen was planned for the northern parts of Montenegro and the Sandžak; its primary objective was the capture of Kolašin through concentric attacks launched from Pljevlja, Prijepolje and Pešter. This would <b>permit</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> link up with forces advancing from Podgorica {{in the south and}} to drive a wedge through the middle of the Partisan lines. Operation Frühlingserwachen involved an Axis force of about 5,000 men comprising some of Đurišić's forces, the SS Polizei-Selbstschutz-Regiment Sandschak, the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Regiment of the SDK, and two reinforced German motorised companies. The operation began on 9 April; Đurišić's forces briefly seized Berane and Bijelo Polje but were soon beaten back by the Partisans. This reversal consolidated the poor German–Chetnik position in Montenegro; their forces in the south were completely isolated from those in the north. Chetnik forces and their allies suffered heavy casualties; the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Regiment of the SDK was reduced from 893 men to 350.|$|E

5|$|In 1097, the Crusader armies {{assembled}} at Constantinople having {{traveled in}} groups eastward through Europe. Alexios I, who had requested only some western knights {{to serve as}} mercenaries to help fight the Seljuk Turks, blockaded these armies {{in the city and}} would not <b>permit</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> leave until their leaders swore oaths promising to restore to the Empire any land formerly belonging to it that they might conquer on the way to Jerusalem. The Crusaders eventually swore these oaths, individually rather than as a group. In return, Alexios gave them guides and a military escort. The Crusaders were however exasperated by Byzantine tactics, such as negotiating the surrender of Nicaea from the Seljuks while it was still under siege by the Crusaders, who hoped to plunder it to help finance their journey. The Crusaders, feeling betrayed by Alexios, who was able to recover a number of important cities and islands, and in fact much of western Asia Minor, continued on their way without Byzantine aid. In 1098, when Antioch had been captured after a long siege and the Crusaders were in turn themselves besieged in the city, Alexios marched out to meet them, but, hearing from Stephen of Blois that the situation was hopeless, he returned to Constantinople. The Crusaders, who had unexpectedly withstood the siege, believed Alexios had abandoned them and considered the Byzantines completely untrustworthy. Therefore, they regarded their oaths as invalidated.|$|E
5|$|Pedrarias, who had {{established}} himself in Castillo de Oro, sent his deputy Francisco Hernández de Córdoba into Nicaragua {{to extend his}} authority over that region. While there, Hernández de Córdoba received news of a new Spanish presence to the north. Gil González Dávila was in the Olancho Valley when he received word that Hernández de Córdoba was somewhere nearby. Hernández de Córdoba sent out an advance party led by Gabriel de Rojas, who González Dávila received in peace. González instructed Rojas that neither Pedrarias nor Hernández de Córdoba had any rights over the territory, and that González would not <b>permit</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> take any action there. Rojas reported back to Hernández de Córdoba, who immediately dispatched soldiers from Nicaragua {{under the command of}} Hernando de Soto to capture González Dávila. The forces of González Dávila clashed with those of Soto at Toreba in Olancho; the exact site of the battle is unknown but was probably close to the modern settlement of Silca. Hernando de Soto camped at Toreba, where González Dávila caught him by surprise with a night-time assault supported by cavalry, crossbowmen and arquebusiers. A number of Soto's men were killed in the fighting that followed, until González sued for peace, giving González time for reinforcements to arrive, at which time González launched a renewed assault. González Dávila succeeded in capturing Soto, along with 130,000 pesos. Although he had won the day, González was aware that Hernández de Córdoba was unlikely to let matters rest, and he also received news that Cristóbal de Olid had arrived on the north coast. Not wishing to be surrounded by hostile Spanish rivals, González set Soto free and rushed north with ten horsemen and twenty infantry.|$|E

25|$|As {{this report}} was {{compiled}} from a Japanese geographical perspective, Japanese {{scholars argue that}} Matsushima (the closer island) refers to Liancourt Rocks and Takeshima (the farther island) refers to Ulleungdo.
