5|$|Such {{motion of}} a <b>phase</b> <b>boundary,</b> {{involving}} advancing and receding contact angles, {{is known as}} dynamic wetting. When a contact line advances, covering more of the surface with liquid, the contact angle is increased and generally {{is related to the}} velocity of the contact line. If the velocity of a contact line is increased without bound, the contact angle increases, and as it approaches 180°, the gas phase will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid. This is a kinetic nonequilibrium effect which results from the contact line moving at such a high speed that complete wetting cannot occur.|$|E
5|$|An ideal {{surface is}} flat, rigid, {{perfectly}} smooth, and chemically homogeneous, and has zero contact angle hysteresis. Zero hysteresis implies the advancing and receding contact angles are equal. In other words, only one thermodynamically stable contact angle exists. When {{a drop of}} liquid is placed on such a surface, the characteristic contact angle is formed as depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, on an ideal surface, the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed. The following derivations apply only to ideal solid surfaces; they are only valid for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the <b>phase</b> <b>boundary</b> line exists in equilibrium.|$|E

2500|$|PEMFCs {{are built}} out of {{membrane}} electrode assemblies (MEA) which include the electrodes, electrolyte, catalyst, and gas diffusion layers. An ink of catalyst, carbon, and electrode are sprayed or painted onto the solid electrolyte and carbon paper is hot pressed on either side to protect {{the inside of the}} cell and also act as electrodes. The pivotal part of the cell is the triple <b>phase</b> <b>boundary</b> (TPB) where the electrolyte, catalyst, and reactants mix and thus where the cell reactions actually occur. Importantly, the membrane must not be electrically conductive so the half reactions do not mix. Operating temperatures above 100°C are desired [...] so the water byproduct becomes steam and water management becomes less critical in cell design.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{there is}} no surface tension in a {{supercritical}} fluid, as {{there is no}} liquid/gas <b>phase</b> <b>boundary.</b> By changing the pressure and temperature of the fluid, the properties can be [...] "tuned" [...] to be more liquid-like or more gas-like. One of the most important properties is the solubility of material in the fluid. Solubility in a supercritical fluid tends to increase with density of the fluid (at constant temperature). Since density increases with pressure, solubility tends to increase with pressure. The relationship with temperature is a little more complicated. At constant density, solubility will increase with temperature. However, close to the critical point, the density can drop sharply with a slight increase in temperature. Therefore, close to the critical temperature, solubility often drops with increasing temperature, then rises again.|$|E
2500|$|Ordinary atomic {{matter as}} we know it is really a mixed phase, {{droplets}} of nuclear matter (nuclei) surrounded by vacuum, which exists at the low-temperature <b>phase</b> <b>boundary</b> between vacuum and nuclear matter, at μ=310MeV and T close to zero. If we increase the quark density (i.e. increase μ) keeping the temperature low, we move into a phase of more and more compressed nuclear matter. Following this path corresponds to burrowing more and more deeply into a neutron star. Eventually, at an unknown critical value of μ, there is a transition to quark matter. At ultra-high densities we expect to find the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase of color-superconducting quark matter. At intermediate densities we expect some other phases (labelled [...] "non-CFL quark liquid" [...] in the figure) whose nature is presently unknown,. They might be other forms of color-superconducting quark matter, or something different.|$|E

2500|$|The term {{phase is}} {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} synonym for state of matter, but there can be several immiscible phases of the same state of matter.

Because phase boundaries relate to changes in the organization of matter, such as a change from liquid to solid or a more subtle change from one crystal structure to another, this latter usage is similar to the use of [...] "phase" [...] as a synonym for state of matter.

40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss and}} analyse the Morita {{approximation}} {{for a number}} of dierent models of quenched random copolymer localization at the interface between two immiscible liquids. We focus on two directed models, bilateral Dyck paths and bilateral Motzkin paths, for which this approximation can be carried through analytically. We study the form of the phase diagram and nd that the Morita approximation gives <b>phase</b> <b>boundaries</b> which are qualitatively correct. This is also true when a monomer-interface interaction is included in the model. When this interaction is attractive it can lead to separation of the <b>phase</b> <b>boundaries,</b> which is also a feature of the quenched problem. We note the existence of non-analytic points on the <b>phase</b> <b>boundaries</b> which may re ect tricritical points on the <b>phase</b> <b>boundaries</b> of the full quenched average problem.
