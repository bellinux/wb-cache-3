40|$|The {{topic of}} photo-equality in {{hardcopy}} technologies {{has been widely}} discussed {{from the beginning of}} digital printing until today. Photographic quality prints can be made on desk-top printers with little compromises in permanence and performance. The paper compares the status of ink-jet prints in professional and desktop systems with commercial photography. The gamut of typical ink-jet dye and pigment-based prints and the influence of using more than four metamerism channels was investigated. In a 6 -channel system, the addition of green and orange leads to a similar increase in gamut as the addition of diluted cyan and magenta. However, multi-level printing allows more continuous tone type tone reproduction and better image quality. Diluted colorants provide the gamut gain in high lightness areas. As light metamerisms are prevalent in pictorial images and natural scenes, diluted metamerisms are more beneficial to metamerism and tone reproduction for a photo-quality printing system than hexachrome metamerisms. Colorant stability considerations limit the ink dilutions as very diluted metamerism dots may suffer from permanence defects. Photographic images may be displayed in areas with natural daylight, tungsten light or fluorescent light. They are expected to exhibit a neutral tone scale under all con-ditions. Very brilliant colorants and certain pigments are shown to have appreciable metamerism metamerism which leads to unacceptable metamerism shifts under mixed illumination. The reproduction of certain important metamerisms is another factor in colorant selection and printer design for photographic reproduction. The <b>paper</b> <b>tint</b> of many ink-jet systems is very bright compared to typical photographic prints and their limitations in minimum density...|$|E

50|$|Marine Oussedik {{became known}} for her works made with ink {{representing}} harnessed horses on colored and gold papers.

Marine Oussedik works on colored <b>papers</b> which <b>tints</b> echo {{the colors of the}} desert sand. Thanks to these papers she can work with white as a true color. She is on the lookout for rare and quality papers like those made in Egypt by the garbage collectors in Cairo who press the sheets at the drying stage. She also works on paper with gold specks.|$|R
