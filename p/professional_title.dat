25|$|In early 1967 Porter turned {{professional}}, riding for the Condor Mackeson team. The {{step up to}} {{the professional}} ranks meant that in the individual pursuit he was now racing 5,000m instead of 4,000m, but in his first test at the distance, he emerged victorious, beating Dave Bonner to win the <b>professional</b> <b>title</b> in Leicester. Porter was then selected to race in the world professional pursuit event in Amsterdam. Porter qualified for the final, but, unsettled by a puncture to his opponent, Tiemen Groen, that forced a re-run, he was beaten by two seconds. Nonetheless, his silver medal led to contracts from track promoters, including an invitation to ride the London six-day race – his first. He crashed on the fourth day, breaking his collar bone, and missed contracts for other six-day races. However, he recovered and spent much of the winter track-racing in Belgium, finishing the Antwerp six-day before returning to England {{for the start of the}} 1968 road season.|$|E
25|$|In his {{professional}} career, Gonzales won the United States Professional Championship eight times, the Wembley <b>professional</b> <b>title</b> in London four times, and the Tournament of Champions three times, plus beating, in head-to-head pro tours, {{all of the}} best amateurs who turned pro, which included every Wimbledon champion for 10 years in a row. During this time Gonzales {{was known for his}} fiery will to win, his cannonball serve, and his all-conquering net game, a combination so potent that the rules on the professional tour were briefly changed to prohibit him from advancing to the net immediately after serving. Under the new rules, the returned serve had to bounce before the server could make his own first shot, thereby keeping Gonzales from playing his usual serve-and-volley game. He won even so, and the rules were changed back. So great was his ability to raise his game to the highest possible level, particularly in the fifth set of long matches, Allen Fox has said that he never once saw Gonzales lose service when serving for the set or the match.|$|E
25|$|Kenny Galarza Arocho (born October 16, 1985) is a {{professional}} boxer. He competes in the light welterweight division, and represented Puerto Rico at numerous events as an amateur. Galarza won seven national championships locally and earned several recognitions in international competition.

50|$|More {{recent studies}} have shown how {{symbolic}} self-completion influences individuals' communication in online media platforms. For example, Cindy and Eddie Harmon-Jones and Brandon Schmeichel have shown how individuals’ need for self-definition affects whether they share symbols of self-definitional attainment online. These researchers examined academic web pages and email signature files to see what types of academic departments and professors were more likely to enlist <b>professional</b> <b>titles.</b> The researchers found that the lower an academic department was ranked within National Research Council Rankings, the higher the number of <b>professional</b> <b>titles</b> the professors in that department displayed in their websites. Similarly, the lower the annual rate of publications and citations professors seemed to have, the higher the amount of <b>professional</b> <b>titles</b> they enlisted in their email signatures. These correlations suggest that the enlistment of <b>professional</b> <b>titles</b> online serve as alternate symbols of accomplishment in their self-definitional areas; the more they felt they were lacking in a certain area, the more likely they were to engage in symbolic self-completion online regarding that particular area.|$|R
