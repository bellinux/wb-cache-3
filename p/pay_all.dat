5|$|All {{five seasons}} of Friday Night Lights were filmed in Austin and Pflugerville. With the show {{yielding}} roughly $33 {{million a year}} in revenue, other states courted the production company after the state of Texas failed to <b>pay</b> <b>all</b> the rebates it had promised to the show's producers. The Texas legislature authorized funding to match the offers of other states, and the production company preferred to stay near Austin, so the show remained in Texas.|$|E
5|$|The debt {{payments}} weighed {{heavily on}} the Senators. For several years, Bryden tried to reschedule the debt on the arena. There were various attempts at filing tax losses to write off the debt, all rejected by the federal government. In 2002, Ogden went bankrupt. It had re-invented itself as Covanta Energy and failed {{not long after the}} Enron scandal. This led to the Senators filing for bankruptcy on January 9, 2003, when it could not arrange financing to <b>pay</b> <b>all</b> it owed to Covanta, becoming due because of Covanta's bankruptcy.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 65 ABC affiliates—28% of the network—did not clear the {{available}} timeslot for the film, {{even with the}} offer of The Walt Disney Company, ABC's parent, to <b>pay</b> <b>all</b> fines for language to the Federal Communications Commission. In the end, however, no complaints were lodged against ABC affiliates who showed Ryan, perhaps because even conservative watchdogs like the Parents Television Council supported the unedited rebroadcast of the film. Additionally, some ABC affiliates in other markets that were near affected markets, such as Youngstown, Ohio, ABC affiliate WYTV (which is viewable {{in parts of the}} Columbus, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh markets, none of which aired the film) and Gainesville, Florida, ABC affiliate WCJB-TV (which is viewable in parts of the Orlando and Tampa markets), still aired the film and gave those nearby markets the option of viewing the film. TNT and Turner Classic Movies have also broadcast the film.|$|E
5|$|Despite all {{receiving}} equal billing in the credits, {{the original}} principal cast members were paid different salaries {{in the first}} few years; Baxendale and Nesbitt were the most well-known, so received more than Ripley, Thomson, Norris and Bathurst, who were comparatively less well-known to audiences. Prompted by the continued success of the show, Andy Harries reviewed the salaries in 2000 and decided to <b>pay</b> <b>all</b> six actors the same amount. The amount was not publicly disclosed but was believed to be £20,000 per episode, plus repeat broadcast royalties. Another pay deal for the fourth series in 2001 increased the salaries of the cast to £50,000. For the final series in 2003, they each received £75,000 an episode.|$|E

Tedisco also called attention to Murphy's failure to regularly vote in elections after the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) announced that Murphy had failed to vote in the 2000 presidential election, along with seven other primaries and general elections between 2000 and 2003. Believing the negative ads run by the NRCC were responsible for his drop in the polls, Tedisco announced that he would take control of campaign advertising from the NRCC.|$|E

5|$|In 2004 and 2005, two state-level {{class action}} suits were filed against Apple in New York and California alleging the first, second, and third {{generation}} iPod music players sold prior to May 2004 {{did not have}} the battery life represented and/or that the battery's capacity to take and hold a charge substantially diminished over time. Rather than litigate these claims, Apple entered into a settlement agreement in August 2005 after a fairness hearing in the California action, with the settlement terms designed to end the New York action as well. An appeal followed the California court's approval of the settlement but the appellate court upheld the settlement in December 2005. Eligible members of the class were entitled to extended warranties, store credit, cash compensation, or battery replacement, and some incentive payments, with all unfiled claims expiring after September 2005. Apple agreed to <b>pay</b> <b>all</b> costs of the litigation, including incentive payments to the class members and the plaintiffs' attorney fees, but admitted no fault. In 2006 Apple Canada, Inc., also settled several similar Canadian class action suits alleging misrepresentations by Apple regarding iPod battery life.|$|E
5|$|After {{three years}} in development, the game was {{progressing}} slowly, and it was unknown {{when it would be}} finished. Activision set a series of deadlines for the project's development to ensure Troika would have sufficient time to effectively test the game, though these milestones were repeatedly extended, and Bloodlines eventually ran over budget. In 2003 Activision intervened, ordering that the game be ready for release in the next few months, and even advancing more money to Troika to complete its work on The Temple of Elemental Evil for Atari, freeing the Troika team to work on Bloodlines exclusively. Activision eventually issued an ultimatum that the project be finished within months, on September 15, 2004. Troika delivered a version of Bloodlines on the required date; due to its scale, the game underwent three weeks of testing. Activision decided that the game was suitable for release, but was contractually bound to withhold Bloodlines until after the debut of Half-Life 2 in November 2004. Troika convinced Activision to use the delay to fund further development; the additional budget was not enough to <b>pay</b> <b>all</b> of Troika's staff, and some employees worked unpaid to complete the project. This version underwent another three weeks of testing to become the final release code; the game was still unfinished when Activision forced its release. Bloodlines creative director Jason Anderson blamed Activision, saying that the publisher took the game from Troika without providing enough time to test and polish it. During the nearly four years of development, he estimated that the team worked overtime for all but two months.|$|E
