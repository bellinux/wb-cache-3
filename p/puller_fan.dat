40|$|This {{exploration}} of the debates {{that have taken place}} in fandom over the ethics of <b>pulling</b> <b>fan</b> fiction and publishing it as original work draws on the notion of the fannish gift economy, which postulates that gifts such as fan fiction and fan art have value in the fannish community because they are designed to create and cement its social structure. Tension exists between fans who subscribe to the notion of a fannish gift economy and those who exploit fandom by using it to sell their pulled-to-publish works. An examination of E. L. James's 2012 Fifty Shades trilogy (comprising the books Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, and Fifty Shades Freed), which began as Twilight fan fiction, in addition to Twilight fan art sold through sites such as Redbubble and Etsy, demonstrates a tension between the two modes of fan expression: sale of artworks appears to be an acceptable practice in fandom, but the commercial sale of fan fic, even when marketed as original fiction, is widely contested...|$|R

50|$|At {{the other}} extreme, some high bypass ratio civil turbofans control the fan working line {{by using a}} convergent-divergent nozzle with an {{extremely}} low (less than 1.01) area ratio on the bypass (or mixed exhaust) stream. At low airspeeds, such a setup causes the nozzle {{to act as if}} it had variable geometry by preventing it from choking and allowing it to accelerate and decelerate exhaust gas approaching the throat and divergent section, respectively. Consequently, the nozzle exit area controls the fan match, which, being larger than the throat, <b>pulls</b> the <b>fan</b> working line slightly away from surge. At higher flight speeds, the ram rise in the intake chokes the throat and causes the nozzle's area to dictate the fan match; the nozzle, being smaller than the exit, causes the throat to push the fan working line slightly toward surge. This is not a problem, however, for a fan's surge margin is much greater at high flight speeds.|$|R

Izzy is angered upon realizing that he was only recruited for his vocal abilities. After a heartfelt conversation with Mats about how he feared he had no control over the direction life has taken him, Izzy begins to reconsider his rock star lifestyle. On the next tour, in a scene directly paralleling one near the beginning of the film with their roles reversed, Izzy hears a fan (Myles Kennedy) singing along with him toward the end of a live concert.

40|$|Heating {{and cooling}} for {{residential}} buildings consumes {{a lot of}} energy in the United States every year, which leads to Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV) systems becoming more common for residential applications. An ERV is a relatively simple air to air heat exchanger with supply and exhaust fans. The supply <b>fan</b> <b>pulls</b> outdoor air into the house while the exhaust <b>fan</b> <b>pulls</b> stale air from the house. The ERV preheats outside air during cold weather and cools/dehumidifies outside air during warm weather. These systems are a good investment because they typically achieve a simple payback of 2 years or less based on energy savings. Â ERVâ€™s also have an important role for Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) in modern energy efficient homes that are carefully sealed to minimize the infiltration. One challenge is determining an optimal strategy for when to turn on the fans for the ERV. Â Unnecessary run time wastes energy by running equipment when it is not necessarily needed for IAQ. This paper explores a demand controlled ventilation strategy that has been deployed in a net zero energy home which was designed and built by Purdue University for the 2011 Solar Decathlon. Â The control strategy only runs the ERV when direct measurements for IAQ indicate that fresh outside air is needed. CO 2, VOC, and relative humidity levels are monitored in the home on a continuous basis. When any of these measurements rise above a specified threshold, the heat recovery system turns on and continues to run until the IAQ levels return to healthy levels. This paper summarizes the results of several years of demand controlled ERV performance in terms of IAQ and energy savings. The results clearly show that this optimized control strategy should be considered in more ERV installations...|$|R
5000|$|Fox {{has certain}} rights for {{afternoon}} MLB games on Saturdays, and ESPN {{has the same}} rights for night games on Sundays. Broadcasters cannot show games of in-market teams, {{regardless of whether the}} game is home or away, if the game of the local team has a certain start time (usually there are no other games scheduled at these times). This, at least theoretically, is to make people watch the out-of-market game on ESPN or Fox. The reasoning is that since people {{will not be able to}} watch their favorite team, they may be willing to settle for some baseball, even if it involves teams they are not as excited about. This results in higher ratings for the national broadcaster by <b>pulling</b> baseball <b>fans</b> away from watching their own team. The Braves and the Texas Rangers (and Miami Marlins before they moved into their retractable roof stadium) have traditionally been allowed to play (and televise locally) Sunday night home games during the summer to avoid the extreme heat often found in their home markets. Otherwise, teams avoid scheduling home games within the broadcast windows of the exclusive network broadcasts (i.e. teams will play at 1:00 Eastern or 7:00 local time on Saturdays). Teams are also able to play (and televise locally) makeup games in the same window.|$|R

In Qin Dynasty, the first emperor of Qin reunited China, and established a new country.

It’s said that in Qin Dynasty, there lived a family named Meng who planted a gourd in their yard. The leaves and branches were so long that they stretched over the wall, and into the yard of their neighbor named Jian. Before long, the neighbor named Jiang had a giant gourd in their yard. When the gourd became mature, Meng and Jiang agreed to cut the gourd into two parts for each of them. However, when they cut it, they found an adorable girl there. Both of them love her very much. After discussion, they drew a conclusion that the girl was going to be nurtured by Meng. She was named Meng Jiangnu. When Meng Jiangnu grew up, she was very famous for she’s pretty, versatile and obedient. She was the apple of the two families’ eyes. One day, when Meng Jiangnu was trying to <b>pull</b> a <b>fan</b> out of a pool, a young man named Fan Xiliang passed by, and saw her. He came to help her get the fan, and she thanked him.
