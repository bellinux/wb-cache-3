40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Brake By Wire is replacing the traditional mechanical control systems with ECUs and it is raising the need to reproduce feelings of eliminated static mechanical components (i. e. hydraulic fluids, pumps and cylinders). Thanks to electromechanical actuators and human-machine interfaces (i. e. active pedal) {{it is possible to}} reproduce such feelings and, therefore, arbitrarily change their features. In this way {{it will be possible to}} customize the pedal feelings and the vehicle deceleration needed depending on several factors (i. e. surrounding braking scenario, driver characteristics, race vs day-by-day driving condition). Since braking maneuvers are typically critical and involve the driver, the design and development of brake by wire system must start from the consideration of human factors in order to increase acceptance and braking effectiveness. The objective of this research was to redesign the pedal feelings, making them adaptable to the surrounding. Driver acceptance and braking effectiveness could be highly improved by means of adaptive pedal feelings. The starting points of this research were humans factors in the braking domain. Literature and relevant studies have been taken into consideration to put into evidence human mechanisms and behaviors during braking phases. On such basis, two main results have been found out: braking use cases and <b>pedal</b> feeling <b>curves.</b> With regard to the <b>pedal</b> feelings <b>curves,</b> 4 different <b>pedal</b> <b>curves</b> which describe both force on brake pedal travel and acceleration on brake pedal travel are designed. The pedal feeling depends on several factors like the pedal travel, the pedal idle travel, the effort, responsiveness, deceleration perceived, ease of balance (i. e. ease of modulation), gradual braking and so on. Regarding braking use cases, they are described by vehicle data as speed, acceleration, angles and relevant rates, engine rpm, gas and brake pedal position/speed and so on. These use cases have been clustered in order to meet the 4 <b>pedal</b> <b>curves.</b> The research continued on the implementation of a Matlab/Simulink/Stateflow model for the use case recognition. Basing on the vehicle data, the model is able to find out in which use case the vehicle is (parking, low speed maneuvers, emergency, downhill, and so on). Once it finds out the scenario, the model applies the most appropriate <b>pedal</b> feeling <b>curve</b> (both force feedback and deceleration needed). In the end, the model commands an EC brushless motor which is responsible of the changing of static springs force feedback of the pedal. The scenario recognition model has been validated through vehicle data on real road whereas the pedal feeling and relevant motor behaviors have been validate on bench tests...|$|R

The proposed modeling scheme consists of representing shapes by <b>pedal</b> <b>curves</b> and surfaces - pedal curves/surfaces are the loci of the foot of perpendiculars to the tangents of a fixed curve/surface from a fixed point called the pedal point.

40|$|Legendre curves are {{smooth plane}} curves {{which may have}} {{singular}} points, but still have a well defined smooth normal (and corresponding tangent) vector field. Because {{of the existence of}} singular points, the usual curvature concept for regular curves cannot be straightforwardly extended to these curves. However, Fukunaga, and Takahashi defined and studied functions that play the role of curvature functions of a Legendre curve, and whose ratio extend the curvature notion in the usual sense. Going into the same direction, our paper is devoted to the extension of the concept of circular curvature from regular to Legendre curves, but additionally referring not only to the Euclidean plane. For the first time we will extend the concept of Legendre curves to normed planes. Generalizing in such a way the results of the mentioned authors, we define new functions that play the role of circular curvature of Legendre curves, and tackle questions concerning existence, uniqueness, and invariance under isometries for them. Using these functions, we study evolutes, involutes, and <b>pedal</b> <b>curves</b> of Legendre curves for normed planes, and the notion of contact between such curves is correspondingly extended, too. We also provide new ways to calculate the Maslov index of a front in terms of our new curvature functions.

More precisely, only a fixed norm and the associated orthogonality (of Birkhoff type) are necessary...|$|R

40|$|In this {{preliminary}} reconstruction of Homo naledi’s gait {{we begin with}} the null hypothesis that it walked similarly to modern humans, as the overall anatomy of this extinct hominin’s lower limb, especially its foot, is mostly modern human-like. We note the following characters as modern-like: dorsally-canting metatarsophalangeal joints facilitating toe-off, locking transverse tarsal joint implying a rigid midfoot during stance, flat subtalar joint limiting ankle pro- and supination, talocrural joint oriented orthogonally to the substrate, valgus knee, thick patellae increasing the moment arm for quadriceps femoris, and well-developed thigh muscle attachment sites throughout the femur. These characters suggest Homo naledi was welladapted to a striding bipedal gait. However, we also note the following less modern-like characters: <b>curved</b> <b>pedal</b> phalanges, low sustentaculum tali and likely a low fundamental longitudinal arch, pronounced tubercular insertion of the pes anserinus tendon on the proximomedial tibia, long femoral neck with a marked medial encroachment of the obturator externus, posteriorly positioned ilium relative to the acetabulum, flared iliac blades, broad lower ribcage, and characters of the lower thoracic vertebrae and lower rib suggesting robust hypaxial muscles. We offer our initial functional interpretations of the cumulative postcranial morphology, which suggests different trunk stabilization from modern humans but is consistent with orthogrady and an obligate bipedal locomotor regime. Given the anatomy of the upper limb, Homo naledi demonstrates coexistence of both bipedalism and climbing adaptations in one hominin taxon...|$|R
40|$|In the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota, the toothless pterosaurs flourished {{with the}} chaoyangopterids and tapejarids playing {{a key role}} in {{understanding}} the early diversity and evolution of the Azhdarchoidea. Unlike the more diverse tapejarids, the rarer chaoyangopterids are characterized by a long and low rostrum, supporting a close relationship with the huge azhdarchids. Unfortunately, our knowledge is still limited in the osteology, paleoecology, and taxonomy of the Chaoyangopteridae. As one of the best preserved skeletons, the type and only specimen of Jidapterus edentus provides an opportunity to understand the morphology and paleoecology of the chaoyangopterids. Our study of the osteology of Jidapterus edentus reveals valuable information about the morphology of the Chaoyangopteridae such as a rostrum with a curved dorsal profile, high Rostral Index (RI), larger angle between the dorsal and postorbital processes of the jugal, sequentially shorter fourth to seventh cervical vertebrae, sternum with a plate wider than long, contact of the metacarpal I with the distal syncarpal, pneumatic foramen on first wing phalanx, hatchet-like postacetabular process with unconstricted neck and small dorsal process, distinctly concave anterior margin of pubis, subrectangular pubic plate with nearly parallel anterior and posterior margins, longer proximal phalanges of pedal digits III and IV, as well as reduced and less <b>curved</b> <b>pedal</b> unguals. These features further support the validity of Jidapterus edentus as a distinct species and the close relationship of the chaoyangopterids with the azhdarchids. Paleoecologically, the chaoyangopterids are probably like the azhdarchids, more terrestrial than the contemporaneous and putatively arboreal tapejarids, which may have been limited to the forest-dominated ecosystem of the Jehol Biota. The osteology of Jidapterus edentus further supports the close relationship of the Chaoyangopteridae with the Azhdarchidae in sharing a high RI value and reduced and mildly-curved pedal unguals, and it also implies a possible paleoecological similarity in their terrestrial capability. Combined with the putatively arboreal and herbivorous tapejarids, this distinct lifestyle of the chaoyangopterids provides new insights into the diversity of pterosaurs in the ecosystem of the Jehol Biota...|$|R
40|$|A forward {{dynamic model}} was {{developed}} to predict the performance of Spinal Cord Injured (SCI) individuals cycling an isokinetic ergometer using Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) to elicit contractions of the quadriceps, hamstring and gluteal muscles. Computer simulations were performed using three inter-connected models: a kinematic model of segmental linkages, a muscle model predicting forces in response to stimulation, and a kinetic model predicting ergometer pedal forces resulting from muscle stimulation. Specific model parameters for SCI individuals were determined through measurements from isometric and isokinetic contractions of the quadriceps muscles elicited using surface stimulation. The muscle model was fitted to data resulting from these isolated experiments in order to tailor the model's parameters to characteristics of muscles from SCI individuals. Isometric data {{from a range of}} knee angles were used to fit tendon slack lengths to the rectus femoris and vastus muscles. Adjustments to the quadriceps moment arm function were not able to improve the match between measured and modelled knee extension torques beyond those using moment arms taken from available literature. Similarly, literature values for constants from the muscle force - velocity relationship provided a satisfactory fit to the decline in torque with angular velocity, and parameter fitting did not improve this fit. Passive visco-elastic resistance remained constant for all velocities of extension except the highest (240 deg/s). Since knee angular velocities this high were not experienced during cycling, a visco-elastic dampener was not included within the present cycling model. The rise and fall in torque following NMES onset and cessation were used to fit constants to match the rate of change in torque. Constants for the rise in torque following NMES onset were significantly altered by changes in knee angle, with more extended angles taking longer for torque to rise. This effect was small, however, within the range of angles used during cycling, and consequently was not included within the cycling model. The decline in torque after NMES cessation was not affected by knee angle. A period of five minutes cyclical isometric activity of the quadriceps resulted in torque declining by more than 75 % from rested levels. The activation time constants were largely unaffected by this fatigue, however, with only a small increase in the time for torque to decline, and no change in rise time or the delay between stimulation changes and resulting torque changes. The cycling model, therefore, did not incorporate any effect for changes in activation timing with fatigue. Performance of the full model was evaluated through measurements taken from SCI individuals cycling a constant velocity ergometer using NMES elicited contractions of the quadriceps, hamstring and gluteal muscles. Pedal transducers measured forces applied to the pedals for comparison between measured and modelled values. A five minute period of continuous cycling using just the quadriceps muscles produced similar results to those found for isolated knee extension. External power output dropped by 50 % over the five-minute period, however there was no change in the pattern of torque production with fatigue. Cycling experiments were conducted using single muscle groups across a range of NMES firing angles. Experimental protocols were designed to seek the firing angles for each muscle that maximised power output by that group. Changes in power output in response to firing angle changes were not large, however, in comparison to the effects of cumulative fatigue and inconsistent power output between trials. This lead to large uncertainties in the determination of those firing angles that maximised power output by each muscle. Results suggest that NMES firing angles to maximise power output by the quadriceps muscles were relatively similar for each subject. For the hamstring muscles, however, substantial differences were observed in the range of firing angles that maximised power output. Results for the gluteal muscles were variable, with some subjects not applying any measurable torque to the cranks, even with maximal stimulation applied. The model produced a good match to experimental data for the quadriceps muscles, both in the shape of <b>pedal</b> force <b>curves</b> and the firing angles that maximised external power output. The individual variability in hamstring responses was not, however, predicted by the model. Modification of the relative size of the hamstrings' moment arms about the hip and knee substantially improved the match between measured and modelled data. Analysis of results suggests that individual variability in the relative size of these moment arms is a major cause of variation in individual's response to hamstring stimulation. There were apparent limitations in the model's ability to predict the shape of crank torques resulting from stimulation of the gluteus maximus muscle. It is suggested that further research be conducted to enable modelling of this muscle using a range of fibre lengths and moment arms...|$|R
