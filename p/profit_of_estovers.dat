5000|$|The Old English {{word for}} estover was bote or boot, also spelled bot or bót, (literally meaning good or profit and cognate {{with the word}} better). The various kinds <b>of</b> <b>estovers</b> were known as house-bote, cart or plough-bote, hedge or hay-bote, and fire-bote. Anglo-Saxon law also imposed [...] "bot" [...] fines in the modern sense of compensation. These rights might be {{restricted}} by express covenants. Copyholders had similar rights over the land they occupied and over the waste of the manor, {{in which case the}} rights are known as Commons <b>of</b> <b>estovers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Leigham was in {{the parish}} of Plympton St Mary but {{is now in the}} parish <b>of</b> <b>Estover,</b> which itself was carved out of the manorial estate in the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Common land, by {{convention}} open land, {{over which}} the lord, certain manorial tenants, and other parishioners held and shared rights. For example, a right <b>of</b> <b>estovers</b> (taking wood) may belong {{to one of these}} groups or all of them.|$|R
2500|$|Pollarding was {{preferred}} over coppicing in wood-pastures {{and other}} grazed areas, because animals would browse the regrowth from coppice stools. Historically, {{the right to}} pollard or [...] "lop" [...] was often granted to local people for fuel on common land or in royal forests; {{this was part of}} the right <b>of</b> <b>Estover.</b>|$|R
