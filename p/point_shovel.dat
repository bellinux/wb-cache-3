40|$|Objective: A shovel with a blade {{perforated}} {{with small}} holes was tested {{to see whether}} a worker would use less whole-body energy to dig wet clay than with a shovel with an opaque blade. Background: A perforated shovel is hypothesized to require less whole-body energy {{on the basis of}} adhesion theory; a smaller surface area would require less physical effort to dig and release soil from the blade. Method: The study involved 13 workers from an electric utility who dug wet clay with two 1. 5 -m long-handled point shovels, which differed only in blade design (perforated and opaque). Oxygen consumption was measured with a portable system while each worker dug wet clay at a self-regulated pace for 10 min. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} number of scoops dug during the 10 -min sessions, but workers dug 9. 5 % more weight of clay with the perforated shovel than with the conventional shovel (404 kg vs. 369 kg, respectively). Furthermore, stable oxygen uptake normalized to weight of participant and to the weight of clay dug revealed that participants expended 11. 7 % less relative energy per kilogram of clay dug with the perforated shovel. Conclusion: A <b>point</b> <b>shovel</b> with a perforated blade is recommended for digging and shoveling wet clay. However, the extra weight that workers chose to dig with the perforated shovel may increase the loading on the spine and may offset the metabolic advantages. Application: Manual shoveling is a common task, and workers may experience less whole-body and muscle fatigue when using a perforated shovel...|$|E
50|$|The best {{practices}} for filling sandbags require a three-person team. One team member will crouch down and hold open the bag {{to form a}} collar opening. The second team member place {{the tip of a}} <b>pointed</b> <b>shovel</b> with sand into the opened sandbag. A square shovel is not recommended as the blade of the shovel will not fit into the sandbag when filling. The third team member will transport and stockpile the filled sandbags.|$|R

60|$|The young {{page was}} {{strongly}} and sturdily built. His garb was an English one, {{but with some}} admixture of Norman fashions. He wore tightly-fitting leg coverings, a garment somewhat resembling a blouse of blue cloth girded in by a belt at the waist, and falling in folds to the knee. Over his shoulders hung a short mantle of orange colour with a hood. On his head was a cap with a wide brim that was turned up closely behind, and projected in a <b>pointed</b> <b>shovel</b> shape in front. In his belt was a small dagger. He wore shoes of light yellow leather fastened by bands over the insteps. As he ran down {{the steps of the}} palace he came into sharp contact with another page who had just turned the corner of the street.|$|R

5|$|Falkenberg and Næsheim {{held onto}} Bågenholm's skis {{as they waited}} for the rescue teams to arrive. At first Bågenholm {{struggled}} in the cold water before she found an air pocket and was able to remain conscious for 40minutes before becoming a victim of circulatory arrest. Ketil Singstad led the rescue team {{from the top of the}} mountain. He skied as fast as he could to Bågenholm's location, where he and his rescue team tried unsuccessfully to pull her out with a rope. They then tried to dig her out, but their snow shovel could not break through the ice. Rescuers from the bottom of the mountain then arrived, bringing with them a <b>pointed</b> gardening <b>shovel.</b> They were able to cut a hole in the ice, and pulled her through at 19:40. Bågenholm had been in the water for 80minutes when she was rescued.|$|R
40|$|AbSTRACT Cliffs and cliff-edges {{are often}} {{attractive}} places to humans, and therefore may become damaged through recreational activities. Restoring cliffs and cliff-edges, {{which can be}} important sites of biodiversity, is challenging {{in part because of}} insufficient knowledge about native plant restoration techniques for these ecologically distinct areas. The cliff-edge at <b>Shovel</b> <b>Point</b> in Tettegouche State Park, Minnesota, has been damaged by heavy visitor use. We propagated 450 three-toothed cinquefoil (Potentilla tridentata) and 450 poverty grass (Danthonia spicata) plants from locally obtained seed to test revegetation techniques. We seeded plots with cinquefoil and poverty grass seeds for comparison with transplanted plots, we monitored survivorship and seedling recruitment for three seasons, and we counted the number of new shoots produced at 3 and 24 months after transplantation. Visitor access to planted areas was restricted during the study. Overall survival rates at 3, 13, and 24 months were 87. 3 %, 76. 9 %, and 68. 9 % for three-toothed cinquefoil and 98. 7 %, 96. 7 %, and 63. 8 % for poverty grass. The grand mean number of new shoots produced per plant was 0. 37 and 2. 11 (SE = 0. 227, 0. 365) at 3 and 24 months respectively for three-toothed cinquefoil and- 0. 21 and- 3. 15 (SE = 0. 584, 0. 295) at 3 and 24 months respectively for poverty grass. Only one seeded plot had a single poverty grass plant {{by the end of the}} study. One-way ANOVA tests revealed no statistically significant differences among treatments within species for survival or number of new shoots produced. We conclude that when transplanted, three-toothed cinquefoil and poverty grass are useful species for revegetation of damaged outcrops such as <b>Shovel</b> <b>Point...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Palisade Head {{is formed}} from a rhyolitic lava flow which was {{extruded}} some 1.1 billion years ago. During the Mesoproterozoic {{era of the}} Precambrian eon, the continent spread apart on the Midcontinent Rift System extending from what is now eastern Lake Superior through Duluth to Kansas; this rifting process stopped before an ocean developed. A flow some 200 feet (60 meters) thick formed extremely hard volcanic rock which resisted a billion years of erosion which cut down surrounding formations. [...] This formed both Palisade Head and <b>Shovel</b> <b>Point,</b> which is within {{the main part of}} Tettegouche State Park about two miles (three kilometers) to the east. [...] The feature is a shallow headland, with Lake Superior to the southwest, southeast, and northeast. Its high point is over 300 feet (approximately 100 meters) above the level of the lake; the lakeside cliffs stand up to several hundred feet (60 meters) above water level.|$|R
60|$|As their drowsy void spoke, {{both the}} old woman and the pompous little figure behind her lifted their eyes, {{and for a moment}} they {{regarded}} the youth and damsel with something like kindness and affection; which, however, were dim and uncertain, and passed away almost immediately. The old woman again betook herself to the shovel, but was startled by a hand suddenly laid upon her shoulder; she turned round in great trepidation, and beheld the dignitary in the blue coat; then followed an embrace of such closeness as would indicate no remoter connection than matrimony between these two decorous persons. The gentleman next <b>pointed</b> to the <b>shovel,</b> appearing to inquire the purpose of his lady's occupation; while she as evidently parried his interrogatories, maintaining a demure and sanctified visage as every good woman ought, in similar cases. Howbeit, she could not forbear looking askew, behind her spectacles, towards the spot of stubborn turf. All the while, their figures had a strangeness in them, and it seemed as if some cunning jeweller had made their golden ornaments of the yellowest of the setting sunbeams, and that the blue of their garments was brought from the dark sky near the moon, and that the gentleman's silk waistcoat was the bright side of a fiery cloud, and the lady's scarlet petticoat a remnant of the blush of morning,--and that they both were two unrealities of colored air. But now there was a sudden movement throughout the multitude. The Squire drew forth a watch as large as the dial on the famous steeple, looked at the warning hands and got him gone, nor could his lady tarry; the party at the tavern door took to their heels, headed by the fat man in the flaming breeches; the tall deacon stalked away immediately, and the short deacon waddled after, making four steps to the yard; the mothers called their children about them and set forth, with a gentle and sad glance behind. Like cloudy fantasies that hurry by a viewless impulse from the sky, they all were fled, and the wind rose up and followed them with a strange moaning down the lonely street. Now whither these people went, is more than may be told; only David and Esther seemed to see the shadowy splendor of the ancient dame, as she lingered in the moonshine at the graveyard gate, gazing backward to the fountain.|$|R
