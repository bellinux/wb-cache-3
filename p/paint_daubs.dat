To the far left foreground of the slide can be seen several swords decorated with white and red paint leaning against the board on which the food is placed. These swords are carried by the pariseo 'Pharisees' during the Easter season (the men with white <b>paint</b> <b>daubed</b> on their faces are pariseo). Items 92037 - 92039 are swords made by children in imitation of these swords...|$|R

When he asks for Betty and says that he is engaged to her, he is told that she is engaged to her leading man, Reginald Duncan, and Bing is ejected by the studio commissionaire. Seeking {{to get back into the}} studio, Bing climbs over a fence but the section is {{revolved}} by a painter and Bing finds himself still outside. He looks through a hole in the fence and gets black <b>paint</b> <b>daubed</b> over his face and this results in him being accidentally given a part as an African American in the film. Dressed in costume he stands over Betty and Reginald waving a large fan while he sings in blackface, 'It Must Be True'.|$|R
60|$|The {{children}} trooping about her, {{she used}} to be drawn to the nearest bit of greensward, tree, or copse, and there would occupy herself with the attempt to sketch, often in company with Edgar; and with a few hints from her father, would be busied for days after with the finishing them, or sometimes the idealising them, and filling them with the personages she had read of in books of history or fiction. She was a sensitive little body, who found it hard not to be fretful, when told that it was very ill-natured to object to having her <b>paints</b> <b>daubed</b> over her drawings by Lance, Robina, and Angel--an accusation often brought against her by rough, kindly Sibby, and sometimes even by Wilmet in an extremity: while Mamma's subdued entreaty, that she would do something to please the little ones, if it could be without mischief to herself, always humiliated her more than anything else, and made her ready to leave all to their mercy, save for deference to Edgar, and gratitude to Felix. Robina would look on soberly enough in admiration; but Lance's notions of art were comic, and Fulbert's were arbitrary, and both were imperiously carried out with due contempt for the inferior sex, and were sure to infect both the little sisters.|$|R
50|$|Hurricane is a 1944 oil {{painting}} by American artist John Marin, {{located in the}} Indianapolis Museum of Art, which is in Indianapolis, Indiana. He used quick brushstrokes and thickly <b>daubed</b> <b>paint</b> to depict a turbulent ocean such as he experienced near his summer home in Maine.|$|R
60|$|Its facings {{are here}} and there daubed over with a tawdry blue; and in other places (without the {{slightest}} regard to uniformity), patches of the same colour may be seen. In their ardour to decorate the sanctuary, the converts must have borrowed each a brush full of <b>paint,</b> and zealously <b>daubed</b> away at the first surface that offered.|$|R
60|$|But, secondly. I said {{landscape}} {{is to be}} a passionate representation of these things. It must be done, that is to say, with strength and depth of soul. This is indeed to some extent merely the particular application of a principle that has no exception. If you are without strong passions, you cannot be a painter at all. The laying of paint by an insensitive person, whatever it endeavors to represent, is not <b>painting,</b> but <b>daubing</b> or plastering; and that, observe, irrespective of the boldness or minuteness of the work. An insensitive person will daub with a camel's hair-brush and ultramarine; and a passionate one will paint with mortar and a trowel.|$|R
2500|$|The fox hunting crowd {{also left}} their {{mark on the}} town in a {{different}} way, through their [...] "high jinks". [...] Out celebrating a successful hunt in 1837, the 3rd Marquess of Waterford and his hunting party found several tins of red <b>paint</b> which they <b>daubed</b> liberally on to the buildings of the High Street, some traces of which can still be seen on doors of older buildings in the town.|$|R

When we reached the spot, we found a picnic-party just finishing their dinner, {{on one of the}} overthrown stones of the druidical temple; and within the sacred circle an artist was <b>painting</b> a wretched <b>daub</b> of the scene, and an old shepherd --the very Shepherd of Salisbury Plain sat erect in the centre of the ruin.|$|R
50|$|San Win’s chief {{subject in}} his work was the famous {{religious}} monuments and sites of Burma, though he did also do more secular landscapes of ordinary life. He did very few portraits and very few still life. Almost all of his work is in oil. In some of his oil works, he used the impasto technique where the paint rises off {{the surface of the}} <b>painting</b> in thick <b>daubs.</b> Watercolor paintings by San Win are rare. He is also known to have made posters with Bogalay Kyaw Hlaing.|$|R
25|$|The Cubists are {{not waiting}} for the war to end to recommence {{hostilities}} against good sense. They are exhibiting at the Galerie Poiret naked women whose scattered parts are represented in all {{four corners of the}} canvas: here an eye, there an ear, over there a hand, a foot on top, a mouth below. M. Picasso, their leader, is possibly the least disheveled of the lot. He has <b>painted,</b> or rather <b>daubed,</b> five women who are, if the truth be told, all hacked up, and yet their limbs somehow manage to hold together. They have, moreover, piggish faces with eyes wandering negligently above their ears. An enthusiastic art-lover offered the artist 20,000 francs for this masterpiece. M. Picasso wanted more. The art-lover did not insist.|$|R
60|$|That is the {{teaching}} that is bawled out {{day by day}} from between those yellow covers. Do they ever pause to think, I wonder, those devil's ladyhelps, what mischief they are doing crawling about God's garden, and telling childish Eves and silly Adams that sin is sweet and that decency is ridiculous and vulgar? How many an innocent girl do they not degrade into an evil-minded woman? To how many a weak lad do they not point out the dirty by-path as the shortest cut to a maiden's heart? It is not as if they wrote of life as it really is. Speak truth, and right {{will take care of}} itself. But their pictures are coarse <b>daubs</b> <b>painted</b> from the sickly fancies of their own diseased imagination.|$|R

Poor Sir Roger's failing as regards the bottle was too well known; {{and it was also}} known that, in acquiring his title, he had not quite laid aside the rough mode of speech which he had used in his early years.

5000|$|... "What {{he did was}} {{equivalent}} to <b>daubing</b> <b>paint</b> on the Parthenon" [...] — Ian DuQuesnay, former college tutor of Jacques, in 2002 Cambridge University Library doubted that Jacques had taken the items himself and suspected a member of staff did. At both Cambridge and London Library, CCTV was introduced and security passes now must be shown. After his 2002 conviction, Jacques was banned from all UK libraries. The Lindley Library says it has improved security and now requires proof of identity. The judge sentencing Jacques in 2010 said that"The effect of your criminality was to undermine and destroy parts of the cultural heritage that's contained within these libraries {{and make it more}} difficult for those who have a legitimate interest in these books to gain access to them because libraries have to take inconvenient and expensive steps to stop thefts of this kind." ...|$|R
5000|$|Morgan {{grew up in}} Glanamman, Carmarthenshire, the {{daughter}} of a headmaster and a drama teacher. In her youth she didn't believe she could succeed as an actress, but states that her parents always supported her career choice. As a back up to her desired acting career, Morgan studied an undergraduate history course at Cardiff University in the 1960s, before training to be a stage actress. Morgan has two children, Stephan (born 1979/1980) and Saran (born 1995/1996) and spent the largest part of her acting career juggling her work and life as a single parent. Speaking of her difficult home/work balance Morgan elaborates that [...] "You manage with the help of friends. You find a way". A Welsh language campaigner, Morgan was arrested in 1988 for <b>daubing</b> <b>paint</b> on the Welsh Office. The actress was afraid that this criminal conviction may have precluded her from gaining a US Visa to film Torchwood in Los Angeles.|$|R
6000|$|The {{conclusion}} {{of the story of}} Cronus runs thus:--He wedded his sister, Rhea, and begat children--Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and, lastly, Zeus. 'And mighty Cronus swallowed down each of them, each that came to their mother's knees from her holy womb, with this intent, that none other of the proud children of Uranus should hold kingly sway among the Immortals.' Cronus showed a ruling father's usual jealousy of his heirs. It was a case of Friedrich Wilhelm and Friedrich. But Cronus (acting in a way natural in a story perhaps first invented by cannibals) swallowed his children instead of merely imprisoning them. Heaven and Earth had warned him to beware of his heirs, and he could think of no safer plan than that which he adopted. When Rhea was about to become the mother of Zeus, she fled to Crete. Here Zeus was born, and when Cronus (in pursuit of his usual policy) asked for the baby, he was presented with a stone wrapped up in swaddling bands. After swallowing the stone, Cronus was easy in his mind; but Zeus grew up, administered a dose to his father, and compelled him to disgorge. 'The stone came forth first, as he had swallowed it last.' {52a} [...] The other children also emerged, all alive and well. Zeus fixed the stone at Delphi, where, long after the Christian era, Pausanias saw it. {52b} It was not a large stone, Pausanias tells us, and the Delphians used to anoint it with oil and wrap it up in wool on feast-days. All Greek temples had their fetich-stones, and each stone had its legend. This was the story of the Delphian stone, and of the fetichism which survived the early years of Christianity. A very pretty story it is. Savages more frequently smear their fetich-stones with red <b>paint</b> than <b>daub</b> them with oil, but the latter, as we learn from Theophrastus's account of the 'superstitious man,' was the Greek ritual.|$|R
6000|$|Rowland's second guest {{was also}} an artist, but of a very {{different}} type. His friends called him Sam Singleton; he was an American, {{and he had been}} in Rome a couple of years. He painted small landscapes, chiefly in water-colors: Rowland had seen one of them in a shop window, had liked it extremely, and, ascertaining his address, had gone to see him and found him established in a very humble studio near the Piazza Barberini, where, apparently, fame and fortune had not yet found him out. Rowland took a fancy to him and bought several of his pictures; Singleton made few speeches, but was grateful. Rowland heard afterwards that when he first came to Rome he <b>painted</b> worthless <b>daubs</b> and gave no promise of talent. Improvement had come, however, hand in hand with patient industry, and his talent, though of a slender and delicate order, was now incontestable. It was as yet but scantily recognized, and he had hard work to live. Rowland hung his little water-colors on the parlor wall, and found that, as he lived with them, he grew very fond of them. Singleton was a diminutive, dwarfish personage; he looked like a precocious child. He had a high, protuberant forehead, a transparent brown eye, a perpetual smile, an extraordinary expression of modesty and patience. He listened much more willingly than he talked, with a little fixed, grateful grin; he blushed when he spoke, and always offered his ideas in a sidelong fashion, as if the presumption were against them. His modesty set them off, and they were eminently to the point. He was so perfect an example of the little noiseless, laborious artist whom chance, in the person of a moneyed patron, has never taken by the hand, that Rowland would have liked to befriend him by stealth. Singleton had expressed a fervent admiration for Roderick's productions, but had not yet met the young master. Roderick was lounging against the chimney-piece when he came in, and Rowland presently introduced him. The little water-colorist stood with folded hands, blushing, smiling, and looking up at him as if Roderick were himself a statue on a pedestal. Singleton began to murmur something about his pleasure, his admiration; the desire to make his compliment smoothly gave him a kind of grotesque formalism. Roderick looked down at him surprised, and suddenly burst into a laugh. Singleton paused a moment and then, with an intenser smile, went on: [...] "Well, sir, your statues are beautiful, all the same!" ...|$|R
5000|$|After calling {{witnesses}} with {{a straightforward}} locus standi under Private Bill standing orders and hearing their objections (detriment to salmon {{fishing in the}} Greta if floods and spates were eliminated, the dangers to gentlemen's residences from aqueduct bursts, interference of the aqueduct with natural drainage, and the undesirable disturbance from constructing the aqueduct through gentlemen's private pleasure grounds (and doing so on five occasions where pipes were used).) [...] witnesses with aesthetic objections were heard. A Stourbridge solicitor owning a house and 160 acres in Grasmere objected to the trace of the aqueduct as 'a great scar on the landscape'; he had laid out £1000 on building roads on his land in hopes of selling plots {{for the construction of}} houses: 'you may build houses without disfiguring the district', but the aqueduct would destroy the essential local feature of the district. [...] A Keswick bank manager objected because the dam would be vulnerable to a waterspout, experienced in St John's Vale many times. He was supported by William Wordsworth (the only surviving son of the poet) who spoke of waterspouts at Rydal, and went on to object that raising the level of Thirlmere would remove its natural indentations: repeated attempts by him to dilate on the lake's associations with the Lake Poets were treated unsympathetically by counsel for Manchester and eventually ended by the committee chairman. Witnesses then testified to Thirlmere having a muddy bottom (but one said it was only found at more than twelve feet down.) The brother (and heir) of the lord of the manor gave evidence that the beauty of Thirlmere lay in it being more secluded than other lakes: his counsel used his examination to suggest that Manchester Corporation was buying excessive amounts of land with a view to selling off building plots should the waterworks scheme be defeated. A Grasmere villa-owner likened the scheme to 'some modern Cockney' <b>daubing</b> <b>paint</b> on a picture in the National Gallery and claiming it to be an improvement; he predicted stinking mud around the edges of Thirlmere because that was what found around Grasmere. W E Forster held both that if Manchester needed water and could get it nowhere other than Thirlmere, the scheme should go ahead; but that - if it did - beauty more valuable than any picture that was or was to come would be lost to the people of England, who would not be recompensed by any amount of compensation to landed proprietors: Parliament should ensure that beauty was not lost unnecessarily. (Forster was not only a prominent politician with a house near Ambleside, but also a partner in a West Riding worsted manufacturer, and Beckett pressed him on why the generation of dust and smoke and 'turning rivers into ink' in the valleys of the West Riding was not in greater need of Parliamentary scrutiny than raising the level of Thirlmere was.) ...|$|R
