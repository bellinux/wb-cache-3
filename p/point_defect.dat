40|$|A {{scientific}} {{challenge in}} developing thermoelectric materials {{is to achieve}} a delicate balance between the thermal and electrical properties of the material. <b>Point</b> <b>defects</b> influence directly the concentration and mobility of both electrical charge carriers (electrons or holes) and thermal energy carriers (phonons).

500|$|There {{are four}} {{fundamental}} {{steps in the}} fusion process. First, the involved membranes must aggregate, approaching each other to within several nanometers. Second, the two bilayers must come into very close contact (within a few angstroms). To achieve this close contact, the two surfaces must become at least partially dehydrated, as the bound surface water normally present causes bilayers to strongly repel. The presence of ions, in particular divalent cations like magnesium and calcium, strongly affects this step. One of the critical roles of calcium in the body is regulating membrane fusion. Third, a destabilization must form at one point between the two bilayers, locally distorting their structures. The exact nature of this distortion is not known. One theory is that a highly curved [...] "stalk" [...] must form between the two bilayers. Proponents of this theory believe that it explains why phosphatidylethanolamine, a highly curved lipid, promotes fusion. Finally, in the last step of fusion, this <b>point</b> <b>defect</b> grows and {{the components of the}} two bilayers mix and diffuse away from the site of contact.|$|E

The latest development of the <b>point</b> <b>defects</b> in ZnGeP 2 is summarized in the paper. Firstly, the <b>point</b> <b>defects</b> are studied by electron paramagnetic resonance technique. The dominant <b>point</b> <b>defects</b> in ZnGeP 2 are V-Zn acceptor, V 0 P and Ge+Zn donors, and their energy levels are E(V-Zn) =EC-(1. 02 ± 0. 03) eV, E(V 0 P) =EV+(1. 61 ± 0. 06) eV and E(Ge+Zn) =EV+(1. 70 ± 0. 03) eV.

50|$|A {{dislocation}} {{that has}} been brought to a halt by an obstacle (a <b>point</b> <b>defect)</b> can overcome the obstacle and start moving again by a process called dislocation climb. For dislocation climb to occur, vacancies {{have to be able}} to move through the crystal. When a vacancy arrives at the place where the dislocation is stuck it can cause the dislocation to climb out of its glide plane, after which the <b>point</b> <b>defect</b> is no longer in its way. Dislocation climb is therefore dependent from the velocity of vacancy diffusion. As with all diffusion processes, this is highly dependent on the temperature. At higher temperatures dislocations will more easily be able to move around obstacles. For this reason, many hardened materials become exponentially weaker at higher temperatures.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Understanding {{the atomic}} {{movements}} of simultanous diffusion of dopant (B) and <b>point</b> <b>defects</b> (V, I) in silicon {{is of great}} importance for both experimental and theoretical diffusion studies. This paper presents the atomistic dynamic diffusion modelling of boron (B), self-interstitial (I) and vacancy (V) process in silicon based on simultaneous diffusion of boron dopant and <b>point</b> <b>defects</b> based on a previous developed theory. The simulation {{is based on the}} random walk theory with three main diffusion mechanisms: namely vacancy, interstitial and interstitialcy mechanism. The migration frequencies of dopant and <b>point</b> <b>defects</b> have been programmed based on the experimental diffusion data of boron, vacancy and Si self-interstitial. This simulation procedure can be seen very clearly about the atomic movements, the interactions between dopant and <b>point</b> <b>defects</b> via three diffusion mechanisms. The diffusion depth of B, V, I in very short time can be estimated from the simulation picture on the screen. The simulation results reflect the simultaneous diffusion as well as the interaction of boron and <b>point</b> <b>defects</b> via the three diffusion mechanisms. The <b>point</b> <b>defects</b> (V, I) were generated during the dopant diffusion and they diffused further into the depth as shown in the results of the simulation {{as well as in the}} previous published experimental findings...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a many-body {{potential}} of Nb for radiation damage simulation was developed based on EAM, {{and most of}} the <b>point</b> <b>defects</b> of Nb can be predicted properly by this potential. By using the constructed potential, the direction-specific threshold displacement energies (TDE) and displacement cascades up to 20 keV of Nb were performed through molecular dynamics simulations. The calculated results of TDE are in good agreement with previous work for V, Mo and experimental measurements. Lowest TDE was found in direction, and local minas of TDE were found in three low-index directions, which has relation: Ed[100]<Ed[111]<Ed[110]. The evolution of displacement cascades, number of the created <b>point</b> <b>defects,</b> the cascade efficiency the clustering of <b>point</b> <b>defects,</b> and temperature role of these parameters at different PKA energies were systematic investigated. It is found that the cascade efficiency is low and it is can be fitted by a power function as many published work did. The fraction of clustered <b>point</b> <b>defects</b> obtained in this work is low, and only some small clusters were formed at the end of thermal spike. As the temperature increases, the productions of <b>point</b> <b>defects</b> and cascade efficiency were somewhat decreases, however, the fraction of clustered <b>point</b> <b>defects</b> decreases more obvious...|$|R

Near a structural transition, the elastic properties win be most strongly affected so as to either raise or decrease the transition temperature, prevent the transition from taking place altogether, or simply modify its nature and the microstructure or domain structure of the resulting phase. One of the well known practical examples is calcium-stabilized zirconia in which the high temperature cubic phase is stabilized at room temperature with greatly improved mechanical properties...|$|R
