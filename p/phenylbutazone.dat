Concentrated equine serum reduced EIPH by 53% through a combined mechanism of a 30% reduction in inflammation and an increased functionality of the WBCs. Other anti-inflammatory agents, such as hesperidin-citrus bioflavinoids, vitamin C, NSAIDs such as <b>phenylbutazone,</b> corticosteroids, heated water vapor therapy, cromoglicic acid or nedocromil, have no beneficial effects in reducing EIPH severity. <b>Phenylbutazone</b> can partially reverse the beneficial effects of furosemide.|$|E
25|$|Horses may acquire cellulitis, usually {{secondarily}} to a wound (which can {{be extremely}} small and superficial) or to a deep-tissue infection, such as an abscess or infected bone, tendon sheath, or joint. Cellulitis from a superficial wound usually creates less lameness (grade 1–2 of 5) than that caused by septic arthritis (grade 4–5). The horse exhibits inflammatory edema, which is hot, painful swelling. This swelling differs from stocking up in that the horse does not display symmetrical swelling in two or four legs, but in only one leg. This swelling begins near the source of infection, but eventually continues down the leg. In some cases, the swelling also travels distally. Treatment includes cleaning the wound and caring for it properly, the administration of NSAIDs, such as <b>phenylbutazone,</b> cold hosing, applying a sweat wrap or a poultice, and mild exercise. Veterinarians may also prescribe antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|From the {{earliest}} records {{regarding the use}} of medicinals to today, the toxicity of certain substances has been described in all Chinese materiae medicae. Since TCM has become more popular in the Western world, there are increasing concerns about the potential toxicity of many traditional Chinese medicinals including plants, animal parts and minerals. Traditional Chinese herbal remedies are conveniently available from grocery stores in most Chinese neighborhoods; some of these items may contain toxic ingredients, are imported into the U.S. illegally, and are associated with claims of therapeutic benefit without evidence. For most medicinals, efficacy and toxicity testing are based on traditional knowledge rather than laboratory analysis. The toxicity in some cases could be confirmed by modern research (i.e., in scorpion); in some cases it couldn't (i.e., in Curculigo). Traditional herbal medicines can contain extremely toxic chemicals and heavy metals, and naturally occurring toxins, which can cause illness, exacerbate pre-existing poor health or result in death. Botanical misidentification of plants can cause toxic reactions in humans. The description on some plants used in traditional Chinese medicine have changed, leading to unintended intoxication of the wrong plants. A concern is also contaminated herbal medicines with microorganisms and fungal toxins, including aflatoxin. Traditional herbal medicines are sometimes contaminated with toxic heavy metals, including lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium, which inflict serious health risks to consumers. Also, adulteration of some herbal medicine preparations with conventional drugs which may cause serious adverse effects, such as corticosteroids, <b>phenylbutazone,</b> phenytoin, and glibenclamide, has been reported.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{individual}} analgesics rarely induce {{liver damage}} {{due to their}} widespread use, NSAIDs have emerged as a major group of drugs exhibiting hepatotoxicity. Both dose-dependent and idiosyncratic reactions have been documented.

Clozapine users in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the UK must be nationally registered for monitoring of low WBC and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC).|$|E
50|$|Opinions are {{conflicting}} {{regarding the}} carcinogenicity of <b>phenylbutazone</b> in animals; no evidence indicates it causes cancer in humans at therapeutic doses. Maekawa et al. (1987) found no increased cancer incidence in DONRYU rats fed a diet containing 0.125% or 0.25% <b>phenylbutazone</b> over two years. On the other hand, Kari et al. (1995) found a rare type of kidney cancer in rats (13 of 100) {{and an increased}} rate of liver cancer in male rats fed 150 and 300 mg/kg body weight of <b>phenylbutazone</b> for two years. Tennant (1993) listed <b>phenylbutazone</b> as a non-mutagenic carcinogen. Kirkland and Fowler (2010) acknowledged that, while <b>phenylbutazone</b> is not predicted to be a mutagen by computer software that simulates the chemicals interaction with DNA, one laboratory study indicated <b>phenylbutazone</b> subtly altered the structure of chromosomes of bone marrow cells of mice. Kirkland and Fowler (2010) furthermore explained that the theoretical carcinogenic effects of <b>phenylbutazone</b> in humans cannot be studied because patients prescribed the drug were given doses far below the level any effect may become apparent (<1 mM). The World Health Organisation's International Agency For Research On Cancer (IARC) stated in 1987 that there was inadequate evidence for a carcinogenic effect in humans.|$|E
5000|$|Clenbuterol is {{occasionally}} {{referred to}} as [...] "bute" [...] and this risks confusion with <b>phenylbutazone,</b> also called [...] "bute". <b>Phenylbutazone,</b> which is a drug also used with horses, was tested for in the 2013 European meat adulteration scandal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenylbutazone</b> {{may be used}} in foals, but {{it should}} be used with {{particular}} caution. Premature foals, septicemic foals, foals with questionable kidney or liver function and foals with diarrhea require careful monitoring.

50|$|<b>Phenylbutazone</b> {{should not}} be used in {{combination}} with vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin or phenprocoumon, as it amplifies the anticoagulant effect of these drugs; with other NSAIDs; or in horses with known kidney or liver problems. <b>Phenylbutazone</b> displaces warfarin from plasma binding sites and toxic blood levels leading to haemorrhage can occur.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenylbutazone</b> {{should be}} {{administered}} only under {{the advice of}} a veterinarian.|$|E
50|$|Periodic {{blood tests}} are {{recommended}} when using <b>phenylbutazone,</b> as agranulocytosis can occur.|$|E
50|$|Oxyphenbutazone is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID). It is a metabolite of <b>phenylbutazone.</b>|$|E
50|$|In horses, it {{is given}} at {{a dose of}} 2.2 mg/kg/day. Studies have shown {{that it does not}} inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and {{leukotriene}} B4, as originally claimed. It is therefore not considered superior to <b>phenylbutazone</b> as previously believed, although clinical signs of lameness are reduced with its use. In fact, <b>phenylbutazone</b> was shown superior to ketoprofen in cases of experimentally-induced synovitis when both drugs were used at labeled dosages.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{one problem}} raised was over documentation; {{all of the}} UK animals with <b>phenylbutazone</b> {{contamination}} tested in early 2013 possessed a [...] "horse passport" [...] that allowed the carcasses to be sold for human consumption. The veterinary residues committee (VRC) reminded the public in July 2012 {{that it had been}} [...] "repeatedly expressing concern" [...] about <b>phenylbutazone</b> contamination. and recent discoveries of contamination suggest that the passport system was not working.|$|E
50|$|Anti-inflammatories {{are always}} used when {{treating}} acute case of laminitis, and include Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS), DMSO, pentoxpfylline, and cryotherapy. For analgesia, NSAIDs {{are often the}} first line of defense. <b>Phenylbutazone</b> is commonly used for its strong effect and relatively low cost. Flunixin (Banamine), ketofen, and others are also used. Nonspecific NSAIDs such as suxibuzone, or COX-2-specific drugs, such as firocoxib and diclofenac, may be somewhat safer than <b>phenylbutazone</b> in preventing NSAID toxicity such as right dorsal colitis, gastric ulcers, and kidney damage. However, firocoxib provides less pain relief than <b>phenylbutazone</b> or flunixin. Care must be taken that pain isn't totally eliminated, since this will encourage the horse to stand and move around, which increases mechanical separation of the laminae.|$|E
50|$|Use in horses {{is limited}} to those not {{intended}} for food. Metabolites of <b>phenylbutazone</b> can cause aplastic anaemia in humans.|$|E

50|$|In the 1968 Kentucky Derby, Dancer's Image, {{the winner}} of the race, was disqualified after traces of <b>phenylbutazone</b> were {{allegedly}} discovered in a post-race urinalysis. Owned by prominent Massachusetts businessman Peter Fuller and ridden by jockey Bobby Ussery, Dancer's Image remains the only horse to win the Kentucky Derby and then be disqualified. <b>Phenylbutazone</b> was legal on most tracks around the United States in 1968, but had not yet been approved by Churchill Downs.|$|E
5000|$|In response, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) {{initially}} {{stated that}} there had been only five cases of slaughtered horses in the UK which had been treated with <b>phenylbutazone,</b> none of which had entered the human food chain. A subsequent review of 206 horse carcasses slaughtered in the UK between 30 January and 7 February 2013 found eight were contaminated with <b>phenylbutazone,</b> six of which had been shipped to France. The UK's Chief Medical Officer, Sally Davies, said the level of contamination, 1.9 mg/kg, posed [...] "very little risk to human health". She added that around 500-600 burgers containing 100% horse meat would need to be eaten to receive the daily human therapeutic dose. Additional tests at that time indicated than none of the products from Findus contained <b>phenylbutazone.</b> Another report found that between two and five percent of samples tested between 2007 and 2011 had <b>phenylbutazone</b> contamination, and that only 50 samples per year were tested. In 2012, 145 carcasses had been tested, and two out of the nine carcasses found positive for bute that year were not reported to the FSA for seven months. In April 2013, the FSA reported it had not only found more than 1% horse DNA in Asda's 340 gram tins of [...] "Smart Price Corned Beef" [...] but it also contained four ppb of <b>phenylbutazone,</b> marking {{the first time since the}} start of the scandal that bute had been detected in a meat product in the UK food chain.|$|E

50|$|Dancer's Image {{was plagued}} by sore ankles during his career. On the Sunday prior to the Kentucky Derby, his {{handlers}} had a veterinarian give him a dose of <b>phenylbutazone,</b> a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory commonly used to relieve inflammation of the joints. At the time, it was illegal for <b>phenylbutazone</b> {{to be in a}} horse's system on race day at Churchill Downs; however, Dancer's Image's connections believed the medication would clear his system in time for the Derby.|$|E
50|$|By 1986, <b>phenylbutazone</b> was so {{commonly}} used {{that in that}} year's Kentucky Derby, thirteen of the sixteen entrants were running on the medication.|$|E

The margin of safety for all NSAIDs is narrow in the dog, and other NSAIDs are more commonly used (etodolac, and carprofen). Gastrointestinal-protectant drugs, such as misoprostol, cimetidine, omeprazole, ranitidine, or sucralfate, are frequently included as a part of treatment with any NSAID. Dogs receiving chronic <b>phenylbutazone</b> therapy should be followed with regular blood work and renal monitoring.|$|E
