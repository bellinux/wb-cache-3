5|$|The {{airport was}} {{originally}} owned as an inter-municipal enterprise by Gaular and Førde. Operating deficits were covered through various subsidies from the state, often with unclear responsibilities and little financial {{risk for the}} owners. Most regional airports, including Førde, were nationalized in 1996 and transferred to the CAA, later renamed Avinor. Widerøe lost the <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>obligation</b> contract to fly to Florø Airport in 2000, and therefore moved its technical base for Western Norway to Førde, which included a new hangar.|$|E

The company won the bid and operations started on 11 June 2005, with newly renovated trains. Following the September 2005 election, all further PSO offerings for railway operations were terminated, and the company was left with the single service, subsequently changing its name to reflect the single route.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1957, and started a service between Venneshamn, Kjerringvik, Vangshylla, Hokstad, and Levanger.

Following {{the opening of the}} Skarnsund Bridge in 1991, the Vangshylla–Kjerringvik Ferry was terminated. In 2005, the company was taken over by Fosen Trafikklag, after the state decided that the route would be subject to <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>obligation.</b> The company lost the bid to Nor-Ferjer, and operation ceased at the end of 2006.|$|E

5|$|Widerøe {{operates}} all {{scheduled services}} out of Førde, connecting it to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Bergen Airport, Flesland {{with a combined}} seven daily flights. The flights are operated with Dash 8-100 aircraft and are subsidized {{as part of a}} <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>obligation</b> contract with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Førde Airport is the local airport for ten municipalities in Sunnfjord and outer Sogn. The airport had 82,356 passengers, 8,109 aircraft movements and 3 tonnes of cargo in 2014. Less than a fifth of the patronage travels to Bergen, and Førde even experiences some leakage by people driving to Bergen Airport directly.|$|E
5|$|Alta Airport {{is served}} by three {{scheduled}} airlines and two charter airlines, providing services to eleven destinations, including two abroad. Both Scandinavian Airlines and Norwegian Air Shuttle serve the airport using Boeing 737 aircraft, each providing two daily services to Oslo and one daily service to Tromsø. Widerøe operates regional services in Finnmark on a <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>obligation</b> contract with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. However, its seven daily services to Tromsø are not subsidized. Widerøe operates de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft on their services, using the 50-passenger Dash8-300 aircraft to Tromsø and the 39-passenger Dash8-100 aircraft on services to regional airport.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{bankruptcy}} of Coast Air in January 2008, Air Norway and North Flying were awarded an interim contract to operate the route from Fagernes to Oslo, with subsidies from the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications. At the same time, the airline started a route from Fagernes to Trondheim Airport, Værnes. In March, they won the <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>obligation</b> (PSO) contract, granting them the route until 31 March 2009. During {{the first half of}} 2008, ridership at Fagernes Airport was reduced by 27.3%, compared with {{the first half of the}} previous year. From 1 April 2009, the Fagernes PSO contract was lost to DOT LT, and Air Norway terminated those routes.|$|E

50|$|The United Kingdom has {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of <b>public</b> <b>service</b> broadcasting. In addition to the BBC, established in 1922, there is also Channel 4, a publicly owned, commercially funded <b>public</b> <b>service</b> broadcaster, and S4C, a Welsh-language broadcaster in Wales.

40|$|The thesis « <b>Public</b> <b>service</b> <b>obligations</b> in air {{transport}} » examines the complex issues regarding {{the relationship between}} the EU transport policy and its competition policy. In this context <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>obligations</b> (PSO) – which in EU law are subject to detailed regulation, currently contained in EC Regulation n. 1008 / 2008 – meet the need {{to strike a balance between}} a general liberalization of {{air transport}} and a policy capable of ensuring compatibility with European aid Treaties, which are drawn up to guarantee the conduct of a <b>public</b> <b>service.</b> The PSO, in fact, involve a certain number of exceptions to the principle of free competition for disadvantaged or peripheral areas in order to avoid their progressive marginalization. Starting from a reconstruction of the principles which inspired the European transport policy, this thesis focuses on the fundamental distinction between State aids (illegal) and the simple compensation of <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>obligations</b> (compatible with European regulations), by describing the legislation in force, the doctrine and the case law of the European Court of Justice. Finally, this research project will analyze the issue of the application of the PSO on islands, including Sardinia, on the basis of the principles – although they are not always consistently applied – provided by the Treaties in order to ensure for these regions the territorial continuity they richly deserve...|$|R
5|$|Plans {{for rail}} transit have existed since the 1970s, {{following}} the 1965 {{closing of the}} Bergen Tramway. A rapid transit design was first discarded, and in the 1990s a light rail line was proposed. The decision to start construction was made in 2005. The first stage was built by the municipality, with financing {{from the state and}} the toll road ring, based on the Bergen Program. Ownership, maintenance and further extensions and vehicles are the responsibility of Hordaland County Municipality through its wholly owned subsidiary Bybanen AS. Operation is governed by <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>obligation</b> contracts issued by the county public transport authority Skyss. From 2010 to 2017 the line and its 20 Variotrams will be operated by Keolis Norge (formerly Fjord1 Partner).|$|E
5|$|Seven of {{the lines}} are {{operated}} by the Norwegian State Railways, owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, while the Gjøvik Line is operated by the NSB-owned NSB Gjøvikbanen. The operating deficit is covered by the state for NSB's lines, while NSB Gjøvikbanen's routes are financed by a <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>obligation.</b> The trains have two sections, manned and unmanned. Validated ticket-holders can travel in the unmanned section, which have orange doors. Manned sections, with gray doors, have a conductor and allow passengers to purchase tickets. Tickets are available at ticket machines at stations; if bought inboard, there is a 20 Norwegian krone (NOK) surcharge.|$|E
5|$|After {{the airport}} opened, {{services}} started with Widerøe-operated twenty-seat de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters. The airline operated two trips Bodø–Røst–Værøy–Bodø on weekdays and one round trip during the weekend. In addition, {{there were two}} weekly trips that connected Værøy to Leknes Airport before returning to Bodø. The service was subsidized by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Widerøe replaced the Twin Otters with 37-seat de Havilland Canada DHC-8-100 Dash 8s in 1995. The route from Bodø to Røst was made subject to <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>obligation</b> from 1 April 1997, which was won by the incumbent, after beating Valdresfly and Helikopter Service in the auction. The following contract, valid from 1 April 2000, was awarded to Guard Air, but this company folded in 2001. Helikopter Service operated the route temporarily until Widerøe took it over again the same year.|$|E
25|$|Vadsø {{is served}} by Widerøe, which {{operates}} 39-seat Dash 8-100 aircraft to other communities in Finnmark. The routes are operated as <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>obligations</b> financed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The airport served 77,348 passengers, 6,967 aircraft movements and handled 294 tonnes of cargo in 2014.|$|R
