40|$|Objective of {{the study}} is to further {{investigate}} <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> strategy on the U. S. equity markets and the possible explanations for the strategy profits. The main contribution {{of the study}} to the existing literature is to provide a thorough empirical study of <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits and to examine the unexplored link between <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profit and short-term return reversals. In addition, this thesis studies <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits in different market conditions and the exposure of the <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits to known market risk factors. The data used in the empirical study comprises of daily stock market return data for the S&P 500 equity index constituents from December 1967 to December 2009. The data set is extracted from Center for Research in Security Price (CRSP) database, consisting of observations for 10824 days and 1331 unique S&P 500 constituents. The main findings of the thesis show that the <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> strategy yields markedly higher risk adjusted returns compared to the S&P 500 benchmark index, which are comparable in size to the earlier studies on the topic. According to the return analysis, the strategy on average yields small but positive returns for majority of the periods, but the returns are at least to some extent driven by small number of high return periods. I also find that <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits persist over time, contrary to earlier studies, and profits to be dependent on the overall market conditions. Although the returns show some time variation, the returns persist also to this day. The <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits are highly exposed to funding liquidity risk as well as overall equity market volatility, which imply that arbitrageurs are constrained to enforce relative pricing discrepancies. The exposure the overall market conditions might prove trading according to the <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> strategy difficult in practice. The main finding and largest contribution to the previous literature is that <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits are independent of short-term reversals and therefore independent of liquidity provision. The profits from <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> are statistically highly significant and are not explained by the relevant factors included in the factor model. I find <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits to have a statistically significant negative correlation with market excess return and Fama/French Small Minus Big factor and positively correlated with medium-term momentum profits.

It is also the first known study of this nature on the JSE. The problem identified by the research is to define and analyse a hedge fund trading strategy based on the concept of <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> using cointegration.

The key findings of the research are that there are two key independent variables which can be used to influence the success of <b>pairs</b> <b>trading.</b> These variables are the cointegration t-statistic, a measure of how cointegrated a pair of shares are, and the opening trading signal variable.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Previous {{literature}} has documented statistical <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> with stocks yielding positive abnormal returns. This phenomenon violates the weak {{form of the}} efficient market hypothesis and cannot be explained by known risk factors. An emerging field in <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> studies focused on information flow has provided interesting results on the relation of statistical trading and information events, but {{without being able to}} explain the abnormal returns. This thesis aims to elaborate this relation by studying analyst recommendations which {{have been shown to be}} related to both stock price movements and information events, but have not been previously studied in connection to statistical <b>pairs</b> <b>trading.</b> DATA I study a daily return data of all U. S. utility sector stocks listed on the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ exchanges during years 2000 to 2010. Of this sample I form 20 stock pairs every 6 months for statistical <b>pairs</b> <b>trading.</b> I match the 20 pairs with newly issued analyst recommendations during trading. The full data consists of approximately 150 stocks forming on average 6 602 potential pairs every 6 months, and 3 126 matched analyst recommendations. RESULTS My results support previous findings that statistical <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> yields positive abnormal returns, though smaller in recent years, and that relative analyst recommendations hold valuable information to investors. However, I find that stock prices do not evidence post-recommendations drift in pairs after being issued divergent recommendations. Divergent recommendations are a signal of a statistical stock pair breaking up. The spread may move to the direction recommendations indicate or irrationally to the opposite direction and hence the direction of the spread between a pair cannot be inferred from recommendations. Pairs breaking up causes negative return to <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> and thus the aggregate abnormal positive return to <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> is driven by pairs that are not issued divergent recommendations...|$|R

30|$|It is {{also worth}} {{mentioning}} that a <b>pairs</b> <b>trade</b> {{is essentially a}} mean-reverting strategy. That is traders bet that prices will revert to a long-run mean.

For this reason, this work promotes the use of a mean-reverting model hugely enhanced by the power of two filtering approaches combined together. <b>Pairs</b> <b>trading</b> is inherently built around models that support data mining and dynamic parameter estimation scheme. In this paper, a method featuring online algorithms is advanced, permitting quick buying and selling decisions that also give traders the capacity to take advantage of tighter spreads.|$|R

50|$|<b>Pairs</b> <b>trading</b> or <b>pair</b> <b>trading</b> is a long-short, ideally market-neutral {{strategy}} enabling traders {{to profit}} from transient discrepancies in relative value of close substitutes.
