We discussed applications of the float-path theory and applied it to solve the time-cost tradeoff problem (TCTP), especially the nonlinear and discrete versions. We proposed a simplification from an angle of path as a preprocessing technique for the TCTP.

Given a source code, a class of sync-timing codes called variable-rate cascaded (VRC) codes is considered that “wrap around ” the source code {{in such a way}} as to enable the decoder to not only resynchronize rapidly when the encoded bits are corrupted by insertion, deletion or substitution errors, but also produce estimates of the time indices of the data symbols encoded by the source code. The estimates of the time indices are modulo-T reductions of the actual time indices, for some integer T called the timing span of the code. These sync-timing codes are analyzed on the basis of the maximum timing span achievable for a given coding rate R and <b>permissible</b> resynchronization <b>delay</b> D. It is shown that the timing span of VRC codes is upper bounded by 2 D(1 −R) +o(D), and that this upper bound is achievable asymptotically in D.

40|$|Inventory {{models with}} deteriorating items have {{received}} considerable attention in recent years. In considering the deteriorating inventory with <b>permissible</b> <b>delay</b> in payments, most researchers {{pay attention to}} a single warehouse. Under conditions of <b>permissible</b> <b>delay</b> in payments, this paper develops a model to determine the optimal cycle time for a single deteriorating item that is stored in two different warehouses. A rented warehouse (RW) is used to store the excess units over the fixed capacity W of the owned warehouse (OW). The rented warehouse is assumed to charge higher unit holding cost than the OW.

It is assumed that the deterioration rate in RW {{is the same as}} in OW, and the holding cost in RW is greater than that in OW.

Data were collected and analyzed from a total of 137 cruising flights in both calm- and turbulent-air conditions. Results of this piloted simulation study verify previous findings that show present military specifications for allowable control-system time delay may be too stringent when applied to transport-size airplanes. Also, the degree of handling-qualities degradation due to time delay is shown to be strongly dependent on the source of the time delay in an advanced flight control system. Maximum allowable time delay for each source of time delay in the control system, in addition to a less stringent overall maximum level of time delay, should be considered for large aircraft. Preliminary results also suggest that adverse effects of control-system time delay may be at least partially offset by variations in control gearing. It is recommended that the data base include different airplane baselines, control systems, and piloting tasks with many pilots participating, so that a reasonable set of limits for control-system time delay can be established to replace the military specification limits currently being used...|$|R

The {{article is}} devoted to the {{development}} of estimation methods of time reserves that should be formed at the train schedule and the schedule for the turnover of freight trains, required to ensure the sustained interaction of technological processes of industrial enterprises and railways for the transportation of freight on schedule. Methodology. The paper considers the issues of bulk conveyance organization between industrial enterprises on schedule. In order to ensure the arrival of trains at the destination station to the specified time, the schedules of rolling stocks turnover must have some time reserves. These reserves, in their turn, should be sufficient for correction action of destabilizing factors. The methods of mathematical statistics were used to study the schedule performance quality of separate trains. Currently the movement of the main part of freight trains is performed on preparedness and occupation processes of separate schedule train paths by some depots are not fixed. Therefore, the analyses of the schedule performance of freight trains do not allow receiving the material for research. And, {{due to the lack of}} statistical material on the punctuality of the schedule for the movement of freight trains, research of the passenger trains movement with subsequent dissemination of results on freight movement were carried out by the authors. Findings. The research proved that the trains arrival at the destination station according to the schedule should be ensured by <b>permissible</b> rating of <b>delay</b> as well as increase the operating time of trains and running intervals.

30|$|Trade {{credit is}} an {{essential}} tool for financing growth for many businesses.

During this credit period, the retailer can accumulate and earn interest on the encouraged sales revenue. In case of an extension period, the supplier charges interest on the unpaid balance.
