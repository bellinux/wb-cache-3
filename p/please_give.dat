500|$|Angelou chose [...] "Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie" [...] as the volume's title {{because of}} her {{interest}} in unconscious innocence, which she says is [...] "even lovelier than trying to remain innocent." [...] The title is a reference to her belief that [...] "we as individuals... are still so innocent that we think if we asked our murderer just before he puts the final wrench upon the throat, 'Would you <b>please</b> <b>give</b> me a cool drink of water?' and he would do so'". [...] Angelou has said that if she [...] "didn't believe that, [...] wouldn't {{get up in the}} morning".|$|E
500|$|Enough Said was {{the fifth}} film written and {{directed}} by Nicole Holofcener. After the release of her fourth film, <b>Please</b> <b>Give</b> (2010), she was approached by Matthew Greenfield and Claudia Lewis from Fox Searchlight, who offered to produce Holofcener's next project on the condition that it was more mainstream than her previous films. She wrote three drafts of the screenplay over six months. The premise was partly inspired by Holofcener's own life as a divorced mother of two teenagers and her [...] "feelings and fears about what [...] life will be like when [...] kids go away". While writing the film, she said, [...] "I was having thoughts about my ex-husband and my new boyfriend and thinking about being married and how I'm trying to have a relationship that's happier the second time." [...] Small details of the plot were also drawn from her life; Albert's guacamole-eating habit was inspired by a story that her boyfriend told her about his ex-wife.|$|E

"With Kennedy only eleven votes {{short of}} the nomination, Ted Kennedy {{approached}} the Wyoming delegation, where Kennedy was known to have {{eight and a half}} solid votes, Johnson had six, and one-half vote remained loyal to Adlai Stevenson. Suddenly one of Wyoming's leaders broke away from a frantic huddle with Ted Kennedy, hopped on a chair, and held up four fingers to the delegates. [...] "Give me four votes!" [...] he begged. [...] "We can put him over the top! <b>Please</b> <b>give</b> me four votes!" [...] Hastily the Wyoming delegates decided to write themselves a footnote to history.

A woman painted all this?... there's nothing sadistic here, instead what strikes the most is the impassibility of the painter, who was even able to notice how the blood, spurting with violence, can decorate with two drops the central spurt!

2500|$|Following in {{the path}} of Canadian {{composer}} Colin McPhee, who had done extensive research in Indonesian music in the 1930s and wrote a number of compositions incorporating Balinese and Javanese elements, Harrison's style began to change, showing the influence of gamelan music more clearly if only in timbre: [...] "It was the sound itself that attracted me. In New York, when I changed gears out of twelve tonalism, I explored this timbre. The gamelan movements in my Suite for Violin, Piano, and Small Orchestra [...] are aural imitations of the generalized sounds of gamelan". Virgil Thomson (with whom Harrison also studied) gave him a copy of Harry Partch's book on musical tuning, Genesis of a Music, which prompted Harrison to start writing music in just intonation. He did not abandon equal temperament altogether, but often expressed a desire to do so. In an oft-quoted comment referring to the frequency ratios used in just intonation, he said, [...] "I'd long thought that I would love a time when musicians were numerate as well as literate. I'd love to be a conductor and say, 'Now, cellos, you gave me 10:9 there, <b>please</b> <b>give</b> me a 9:8 instead,' I'd love to get that!" ...|$|E

Farino knew Meester from Entourage where he directed her in the show's first season. He approached her while she was in the dressing room, preparing for a Gossip Girl episode shooting, and they made a [...] "rushed audition". About her role, Meester said: [...] "It’s a complete 180-degree turn from anything I’ve ever done. This fulfills something within myself that I could never find in my series [...]" [...] Even though Alia Shawkat's name was the first mentioned by the casting director, Farino met with a lot of actresses for the role of Vanessa. Shawkat met Farino a year before she auditioned where he told her that they were considering Ellen Page for the part. After Page turned it down, Shawkat auditioned twice and was cast. Allison Janney and Olvier Platt had also worked together before in the television series The West Wing, while Catherine Keener and Platt had starred in the movie <b>Please</b> <b>Give.</b>|$|E
