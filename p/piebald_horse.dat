It was rather to Cecily that Dona Felipa seemed to be characteristically exuberant and childishly feminine.

60|$|Then the {{throbbing}} town, with its thousand distracting voices, grew maddening to me. I {{felt the need}} of converse with solitude, that master and teacher of all the arts, and I bethought me of the Yorkshire Wolds, where a man may walk all day, meeting no human creature, hearing no voice but the curlew's cry; where, lying prone upon the sweet grass, he may feel the pulsation of the earth, travelling at its eleven hundred miles a minute through the ether. So one morning I bundled many things, some needful, more needless, into a bag, hurrying lest somebody or something should happen to stay me, and that night I lay in a small northern town that stands upon the borders of smokedom at {{the gate of the}} great moors; and at seven the next morning I took my seat beside a one-eyed carrier behind an ancient piebald mare. The one-eyed carrier cracked his whip, the <b>piebald</b> <b>horse</b> jogged forward. The nineteenth century, with its turmoil, fell away behind us; the distant hills, creeping nearer, swallowed us up, and we became but a moving speck upon the face of the quiet earth.|$|E
60|$|But when we {{turn from}} the {{question}} of the possibility of miracles, however they may be defined, in the abstract, to that respecting the grounds upon which we are justified in believing any particular miracle, Hume's arguments have a very different value, for they resolve themselves into a simple statement of the dictates of common sense--which may be expressed in this canon: the more a statement of fact conflicts with previous experience, the more complete must be the evidence which is to justify us in believing it. It is upon this principle that every one carries on the business of common life. If a man tells me he saw a <b>piebald</b> <b>horse</b> in Piccadilly, I believe him without hesitation. The thing itself is likely enough, and there is no imaginable motive for his deceiving me. But if the same person tells me he observed a zebra there, I might hesitate a little about accepting his testimony, unless I were well satisfied, not only as to his previous acquaintance with zebras, but as to his powers and opportunities of observation in the present case. If, however, my informant assured me that he beheld a centaur trotting down that famous thoroughfare, I should emphatically decline to credit his statement; and this even if he were the most saintly of men and ready to suffer martyrdom in support of his belief. In such a case, I could, of course, entertain no doubt of the good faith of the witness; it would be only his competency, which unfortunately has {{very little to do with}} good faith or intensity of conviction, which I should presume to call in question.|$|E
60|$|Altogether, Don Anastacio in his ringlets was an ineffectual, colourless, effeminate person, {{a perfect}} {{contrast}} to his ugly, barrel- shaped, badly-dressed but robust-minded neighbour, Gandara. Yet he too had a taste in animals which distinguished him among his fellow- landowners, and even reminded one of Gandara in a ridiculous way. For just as Gandara was devoted to <b>piebald</b> <b>horses,</b> so Don Anastacio was devoted to pigs. It {{would not have been}} like him if these had been pigs for profit: they were not animals fit to be fattened for the market, and no person would have thought of buying such beasts. They were of the wild-pig breed, descended originally from the European animal introduced by the early Spanish colonists, but after two or three centuries of feral life a good deal changed in appearance from their progenitors. This feral pig was called barraco in the vernacular, and was about a third less in size than the domestic animal, with longer legs and more pointed face, and of a uniform deep rust-red in colour. Among hundreds I never saw one with any black or white on it.|$|R
60|$|Patriarchs {{were fairly}} {{common in the}} land of my nativity: grave, dignified old men with {{imposing}} beards, owners of land and cattle and many horses, though many of them could not spell their own names; handsome too, some of them with regular features, descendants of good old Spanish families who colonized the wide pampas in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. I do not think I have got one of this sort in the preceding chapters which treat of our neighbours, unless it be Don Anastacio Buenavida of the corkscrew curls and quaint taste in pigs. Certainly he was of the old landowning class, and in his refined features and delicate little hands and feet gave evidence of good blood, but the marks of degeneration were equally plain; he was an effeminate, futile person, and not properly to be ranked with the patriarchs. His ugly grotesque neighbour of the <b>piebald</b> <b>horses</b> was more like one. I described the people that lived nearest to us, our next-door neighbours so to speak, because I knew them from childhood and followed their fortunes when I grew up, and was thus able to give their complete history. The patriarchs, the grand old gaucho estancieros, I came to know, were scattered all over the land, but, with one exception, I did not know them intimately from childhood, and though I could fill this chapter with their portraits I prefer to give it all to the one I knew best, Don Evaristo Penalva, a very fine patriarch indeed.|$|R

When the battle was lost Sir Rowland escaped to Cotheridge as best he might, and leaving his exhausted charger at one of his farmhouses, went straightway to bed. It was not long, as he had foreseen, that a troop of Cromwell's army made their appearance at the Court, and demanded to see Sir Rowland. They were told he was ill in bed, but this did not prevent their rushing into his room."So you were fighting against us at Worcester to-day, were you ?" [...] asked the crop-heads. [...] "I!" [...] says Mr. Berkeley, faintly and innocently. [...] "Why I am sick and forced to keep my bed!" [...] "All very fine," [...] said they, [...] "but you were there, and very conspicuous, riding a piebald charger." [...] "It could not have been I," [...] says the sick man, [...] "for though I certainly do ride a piebald charger when I am in health, yet he has never been out of the stable all day. If you doubt my word you had better go to the stable and satisfy yourselves.""Thereupon the roundheads go and find piebald No. 2 as fresh as a daisy, and evidently not from Worcester.

6000|$|... “It was in North Wales,” said Treddleford, “that {{my sister}} met with her sensational {{carriage}} accident last year. She {{was on her}} way to a garden-party at Lady Nineveh’s, about the only garden-party that ever comes to pass in those parts in the course of the year, and therefore a thing that she would have been very sorry to miss. She was driving a young horse that she’d only bought a week or two previously, warranted to be perfectly steady with motor traffic, bicycles, and other common objects of the roadside. The animal lived up to its reputation, and passed the most explosive of motor-bikes with an indifference that almost amounted to apathy. However, I suppose we all draw the line somewhere, and this particular cob drew it at travelling wild beast shows. Of course my sister didn’t know that, but she knew it very distinctly when she turned a sharp corner and found herself in a mixed company of camels, <b>piebald</b> <b>horses,</b> and canary-coloured vans. The dogcart was overturned in a ditch and kicked to splinters, and the cob went home across country. Neither my sister nor the groom was hurt, but the problem of how to get to the Nineveh garden-party, some three miles distant, seemed rather difficult to solve; once there, of course, my sister would easily find some one to drive her home. ‘I suppose you wouldn’t care for the loan of a couple of my camels?’ the showman suggested, in humorous sympathy. ‘I would,’ said my sister, who had ridden camel-back in Egypt, and she overruled the objections of the groom, who hadn’t. She picked out two of the most presentable-looking of the beasts and had them dusted and made as tidy as was possible at short notice, and set out for the Nineveh mansion. You may imagine the sensation that her small but imposing caravan created when she arrived at the hall door. The entire garden-party flocked up to gape. My sister was rather glad to slip down from her camel, and the groom was thankful to scramble down from his. Then young Billy Doulton, of the Dragoon Guards, who has been a lot at Aden and thinks he knows camel-language backwards, thought he would show off by making the beasts kneel down in orthodox fashion. Unfortunately camel words-of-command are not the same all the world over; these were magnificent Turkestan camels, accustomed to stride up the stony terraces of mountain passes, and when Doulton shouted at them they went side by side up the front steps, into the entrance hall, and up the grand staircase. The German governess met them just at the turn of the corridor. The Ninevehs nursed her with devoted attention for weeks, and when I last heard from them she was well enough to go about her duties again, but the doctor says she will always suffer from Hagenbeck heart.” ...|$|R

6000|$|Gandara's great {{business}} was horse-breeding, {{and as a}} rule he kept about a thousand brood mares, so that the herds usually numbered about three thousand head. Strange to say, they were nearly all piebalds. The gaucho, from the poorest worker on horseback to the largest owner of lands and cattle, has, or had in those days, a fancy for having all his riding-horses of one colour. Every man as a rule had his tropilla--his own half a dozen or {{a dozen or more}} saddle-horses, and he would have them all as nearly alike as possible, so that one man had chestnuts, another browns, bays, silver- or iron-greys, duns, fawns, cream-noses, or blacks, or whites, or piebalds. On some estancias the cattle, too, were all of one colour, and I remember one estate where the cattle, numbering about six thousand, were all black. Our neighbour's fancy was for <b>piebald</b> <b>horses,</b> and so strong was it that he wished not to have any one-coloured animals in his herd, {{despite the fact that he}} bred horses for sale and that piebalds were not so popular as horses of a more normal colouring. He would have done better if, sticking to one colour, he had bred iron-greys, cream- noses, chestnuts, or fawns or duns--all favourite colours; or better still if he had not confined himself to any one colour. The stallions were all piebalds, but many of the brood mares were white, as he had discovered that he could get as good if not better results from keeping white as well as pie-bald mares. Nobody quarrelled with Gandara on account of his taste in horses; on the contrary, he and his vast parti-coloured herds were greatly admired, but his ambition to have a monopoly in piebalds was sometimes a cause of offence. He sold two-year-old geldings only, but never a mare unless for slaughter, for in those days the half-wild horses of the pampas were annually slaughtered in vast numbers just for the hides and grease. If he found a white or piebald mare in a neighbour's herd he would not rest until he got possession of it, and by giving double its value in money or horses he seldom found any difficulty in getting what he wanted. But occasionally some poor gaucho with only a few animals would refuse to part with a piebald mare, either out of pride, or [...] "cussedness" [...] as an American would say, or because he was attached to it, and this would stir Gandara's soul to its deepest depth and bring up all the blackness in him to the surface. [...] "What do you want, then?" [...] he would shout, sitting on his horse and making violent gestures with his right hand and arm, barking out his words. [...] "Have I not offered you enough? Listen! What is a white mare to you--to you, a poor man--more than a mare of any other colour? If your riding-horses must be of one colour, tell me the colour you want. Black or brown or bay or chestnut, or what? Look! you shall have two young unbroken geldings of two years in exchange for the mare. Could you make a better exchange? Were you ever treated more generously? If you refuse it will be out of spite, and I shall know how to treat you. When you lose your animals and are broken, when your children are sick with fever, when your wife is starving, you shall not come to me for a horse to ride on, nor for money, nor meat, nor medicine, since you will have me for an enemy instead of a friend." ...|$|R
5000|$|Genetically, a <b>piebald</b> <b>horse</b> {{begins with}} a black base coat colour, and then the horse also has an allele for one of three basic {{spotting}} patterns overlaying the base colour. The most common coloured spotting pattern is called tobiano, and is a dominant gene. Tobiano creates spots that are large and rounded, usually with a somewhat vertical orientation, with white that usually crosses {{the back of the}} horse, white on the legs, with the head mostly dark. Three less common spotting genes are the sabino, frame, and splash overo genes, which create various patterns that are mostly dark, with jagged spotting, often with a horizontal orientation, white on the head. The frame variant has dark or minimally marked legs. The sabino pattern can be very minimal, usually adding white that runs up the legs onto the belly or flanks, with [...] "lacy" [...] or roaning {{at the edge of the}} white, plus white on the head that either extends past the eye, over the chin, or both. The genetics of overo and sabino are not yet fully understood, but they can appear in the offspring of two solid-coloured parents, whereas a tobiano must always have at least one tobiano parent.|$|E

40|$|When one utters a colour term, {{one is not}} {{directly}} pointing {{to a state of}} the world, but is connecting or correlating that term with a cultural unit or concept (Eco 1985). Referential usage of a colour term occurs when there is reference to a colour as an abstract concept, while descriptive usage occurs at an earlier stage, when there is a reference to an object which has a particular colour. The present study, based on the data elicited from glossaries, early classics and anthologies, analyses the cases of semantic extension of the lexemes that originally denoted cattle or horses of particular colours (e. g., lí ‘a pure black horse’ → ‘black’ (of mammal hair), wù ‘multi-coloured ox’ → ‘multi-coloured’ (of pelage and textiles)). One of the evolved subgroups includes the peculiar case of the lexeme xīng (red-yellow ox, red-yellow horse → yellowish red). Originally context-restricted, it became an independent semantico-phonetic element and formed a secondary semantic node in the derived lexemes xīng [DET “soil”] ‘red soil’ and xīng [DET “horse”] ‘red horse’. I will also argue that the lexeme liúhuáng—the only disyllabic canonical jiàn sè—originally denoted dun horse, and therefore stood for BROWN and not for GREENISH-YELLOW, as suggested in some explanatory sources. The dichotomy between homochromous and heterochromous animals for sacral and utilitarian purposes had been fundamental in the Chinese society up {{to the end of the}} Warring States Period; after which, under the influence of the Xiongnu, the determining factor for animals’ choosing became their physical characteristics, like in the case with Zhuī, the fast and hardy <b>piebald</b> <b>horse</b> of Xiang Yu.
