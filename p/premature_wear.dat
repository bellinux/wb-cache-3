5|$|Muntz {{designed}} a stereo tape player called the Autostereo for cars {{and had it}} inexpensively manufactured in Japan. The Autostereo could play a complete album without changing tracks or turning the tape over, did not suffer from skipping or <b>premature</b> <b>wear</b> as the phonograph-based players did, and its number of knobs and controls were minimized to allow the driver {{to concentrate on the}} road. The tape player gave customers greater control over their listening experiences, because the tapes never ran advertisements or public service announcements, unlike radio broadcasts. Muntz sold the players and cartridges from his own stores and through franchises in Florida and Texas.|$|E

50|$|In May 2014, Holden {{recalled}} nearly 42,000 VF and WN Caprice models after {{a potential}} problem with the front seatbelts was identified. It {{was found that the}} pretensioner wiring harness for the seatbelts could make contact with part of the buckle assembly, leading to <b>premature</b> <b>wearing</b> of the wiring harness which could disable the pretensioner system {{in the event of an}} accident. The VF was recalled again a month later, when it was found that the drive gear for the windscreen wiper motor could fail. LPG models were recalled in July after it was identified that the feed hose could develop a slow leak at the end of the vehicle's lifetime, creating a low risk of fire.|$|R
25|$|Note: The US Army {{phased out}} the M60D {{in favor of}} the M240D and {{subsequently}} M240H. While the mount system designation remains the same, the mount itself has been extensively redesigned to accommodate the ammunition magazine and a bag for catching expended ammunition casings and ammunition links, as well as an improved roller on the pintle to prevent excessive and <b>premature</b> <b>wear</b> to the mount assembly.|$|E
25|$|A more {{aggressive}} angle, such as 90 degrees, is suited for very soft plastics and other materials; it would wear rapidly in hard materials. Such a bit is generally self-starting and can cut very quickly. A shallower angle, such as 150 degrees, is suited for drilling steels and other tougher materials. This style of bit requires a starter hole, {{but does not}} bind or suffer <b>premature</b> <b>wear</b> so long as a suitable feed rate is used.|$|E
25|$|Horses needed attendants: {{hitching}} a six-horse {{field artillery}} team, for example, required six men working {{for at least}} an hour. Horse health deteriorated after only ten days of even moderate load, requiring frequent refits; recuperation took months and the replacement horses, in turn, needed time to get along with their teammates and handlers. Good stables around the front line were scarce, makeshift lodgings caused <b>premature</b> <b>wear</b> and disease. Refit of front-line horse units consumed eight to ten days, slowing down operations.|$|E
50|$|The Super's cams {{are also}} line-bored (a feature first {{seen in the}} Euro 1985 VF1000F & F-II, and 85/86 VF1000R, 1986 VF500F, 1986 VF700C Magna), which greatly reduced the <b>premature</b> cam <b>wear</b> that plagued the earlier models, {{together}} with changed oil ducts.|$|R

500|$|Construction of the LRT Line 1 {{started in}} September 1981 with the Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (now the Philippine National Construction Corporation) as the {{contractor}} with assistance from Losinger, a Swiss firm, and the Philippine subsidiary of Dravo, an American firm. [...] The government appointed Electrowatt Engineering Services of Zürich to oversee construction and eventually became {{responsible for the}} extension studies of future expansion projects. [...] The line was test-run in March 1984, and {{the first half of}} LRT-1, from Baclaran to Central Terminal, was opened on December 1, 1984. [...] The second half, from Central Terminal to Monumento, was opened on May 12, 1985. Overcrowding and poor maintenance took its toll a few years after opening. [...] In 1990, the LRT-1 fell so far into disrepair due to <b>premature</b> <b>wear</b> and tear that trains headed to Central Terminal station had to slow to a crawl to avoid further damage to the support beams below as cracks reportedly began to appear. [...] The premature ageing of LRT-1 led to an extensive refurbishing and structural capacity expansion program with a help of Japan's ODA.|$|E
500|$|The early A1 Pacifics were a {{match for}} the {{performances}} demanded {{of them in the}} early 1920s. They were certainly able to take loads single-handed that were beyond the capacity of their Atlantic predecessors as was shown in a test run made by 1471 when it took a 20-coach train weighing [...] over the [...] from London to Grantham at an average speed of [...] However this was at the cost of heavy coal consumption, and general performance was well below the ultimate potential of the design. This was largely due to a regression from the earlier 3-cylinder 2-6-0 design, which was the first to have the standard Gresley conjugated motion combined with long valve travel. [...] However, practical problems were experienced with components quickly suffering from <b>premature</b> <b>wear,</b> especially in the main bearing of the large 2:1 lever which had not yet been fitted with the very necessary ball race; excessive 'play' led to so much over-travel of the middle valve, that it began to hit the end-covers. In order to prevent this, when applying the gear to the Pacifics, Gresley fell back on the expedient of shortening valve travel even though that choked the exhaust at speed, was responsible for the heavy coal consumption, and negated most of the advantages gained by the locomotive's revolutionary design. However, by incorporating the Great Western-inspired valve modifications, the economies in coal and water consumption achieved were such that the 180psi Pacifics could undertake long-distance non-stop runs that were previously impossible.|$|E
2500|$|Neither {{locomotive}} {{was initially}} a success, although the design problems were resolved. In {{the case of}} Caledonian the vertical cylinders were placed between the frames {{in front of the}} smokebox and drove vertically mounted connecting rods attached to the leading wheels, which were also in front of the smokebox. It had a tendency to derail and had to be rebuilt with inside cylinders and a cranked axle. Vertical cylinders were the norm at this time (other builders used them too), the theory being that a horizontal or inclined arrangement would lead to <b>premature</b> <b>wear</b> due to the weight of the piston.

5000|$|Volvo {{increased}} {{engine displacement}} to 2.8 litres in 1980 {{with the introduction}} of the B28E and B28F, which were prone to top-end oiling troubles and <b>premature</b> camshaft <b>wear.</b> Some export markets also received the lower output carburetted B28A engine with [...] at 5,250 rpm, capable of running on lower-octane fuel. Nevertheless, Volvo continued to use the B28 V6 in their new 760 model. DeLorean Motor Company went on to use the PRV B28F in their DMC-12 vehicle, and a three-litre version was used in the 1987-1992 Eagle Premier, Dodge Monaco, and Renault 25. The updated B280 engine used in the final years of the 760 and 780 models did not suffer from the same <b>premature</b> camshaft <b>wear</b> as the earlier PRV engines.

50|$|The {{aluminum}} M52 engine received {{criticism in}} some markets {{with high levels}} of sulfur in the petrol during the late 1990s. Sulfur has a corrosive effect on Nikasil and led to many early M52 and M60 engines having <b>premature</b> bore-liner <b>wear.</b> In the US, the M52 used an iron block (except for the M52B28 in the Z3 which was an aluminum block), so the Nikasil problem does not apply to most M52 engines in the US.|$|R
2500|$|In June 2012, {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{electrical}} transformers involved in the ship's propulsion system failed, after an earlier engineers report highlighted [...] "overheating of the propulsion motors and transformers". Inspection found that insulation failure had short-circuited the transformer, while other transformers aboard showed <b>premature</b> <b>wear.</b> Unable to find an available spare, a new unit had to be ordered from the manufacturer. In June, it was predicted that Choules would be out of service for four to five months, but by October, claims were made that the ship would be inoperable until at least January 2013, and if all of the wear-showing transformers were replaced, she would not return to service until April 2013. By December, the faulty transformer had been replaced, and the RAN had decided that although the other transformers (propulsion and others) had been shown to have acceptable levels of wear, all would be replaced before Choules was reactivated. These repairs were completed in early 2013, and the ship was assessed as ready to re-enter service on 12 April.|$|E
2500|$|The G35 sedan was {{refreshed}} {{inside and}} out for the 2005 model year and the coupe for the 2005 and 2006 model years. The interior was given sportier gauges with better backlighting and higher quality trim and knobs. Genuine aluminum trim replaces [...] "tinted" [...] interior trim, and the dash and center console layout were revised. Rosewood trim becomes available as a package on the 2005 models. MP3/WMA playback {{was added to the}} now standard 6 disc in-dash CD player, and the cassette player was removed. Brembo brakes were removed for the 2005 and 2006 models, and the brakes were redesigned with larger discs and a different caliper design. This was partly in response to a number of complaints about the previous years' brakes, which included a class action lawsuit filed in California related to <b>premature</b> <b>wear</b> on 2003–2004 models. A sport-tuned suspension package was standard on all six-speed manual equipped models, which included a viscous limited slip differential and the higher output VQ35DE [...] "Rev-UP" [...] engine. The 2006 models received minor updates. On the exterior there were new headlights, taillights, spoiler, sport side sills, and front bumper.

50|$|The tire {{contact patch}} is readily changed by both over- and underinflation. Overinflation may {{increase}} the wear on the center contact patch, and underinflation will cause a concave tread, resulting in less center contact, though the overall contact patch will still be larger. Most modern tires will wear evenly at high tire pressures, but will degrade prematurely if underinflated. An increased tire pressure may decrease rolling resistance, and may also result in shorter stopping distances If tire pressure is too low, the tire contact patch is greatly increased. This increases rolling resistance, tire flexing, and friction between the road and tire. Under-inflation can lead to tire overheating, <b>premature</b> tread <b>wear,</b> and tread separation in severe cases.|$|R

50|$|The engine's {{downfall}} was <b>premature</b> camshaft <b>wear</b> in {{some early}} models {{in both the}} V45 and V65. In retrospect, the wear was caused by inadequate oil flow to the heads/cams, driving {{for a long time}} on low engine speeds (under 3,000 rpm) and at cold start /engine warm-up procedure, non-accurate valve adjustment, and insufficient maintenance. But this came too late to save the engine's reputation. Honda itself at first denied there was a problem, then blamed inadequate or incorrect maintenance for the problem. They changed the maintenance interval, and developed and sold a special tool for 'proper' valve-lash adjustment. They eventually made changes to the design and production methods of the engine which eliminated the problem.|$|R
40|$|Mill rolls {{are ones}} {{of the most}} {{expensive}} tools applied in plastic working processes and have to satisfy several criteria, which allow them to be used. Cast iron mill rolls, due to their fracture toughness and tribological properties, are the most often applied at hot-rolling in the last rolling stands. This results from the smallest dynamic loads of such rolling stands and the decisive influence of the surface quality of these tools on the surface quality of the rolled product. An improper microstructure of rolls can lead to their <b>premature</b> <b>wearing,</b> e. g. broken flanges, pivots twisting off etc. By means of the heat treatment the matrix microstructure and morphology of carbide precipitationscan be modified and this in-turn can influence cast iron properties. Determination of the influence of microstructure changes, caused by the heat treatment, on the properties of EN-GJN-HV 300 low-alloycast iron, after its modification and spheroidization – is the aim of the present paper. Those changes are based on the formation pearlitic or bainitic matrices at the similar morphology of graphite and ledeburitic cementite precipitations. The performed investigations should enable designing the heat treatment of cast iron metallurgical rolls {{in such a way as}} to obtain the optimal microstructures for functional parameters of these type of tools. The influence of changing the pearlitic matrix into the bainitic one on such properties as: hardness, impact strength, tensile strength, creep limit, bending strength and a stress intensity factor KIc was investigated in this study. Samples for testing, the listed above mechanical properties, were taken from an industrial casting with care to have pieces of very similar crystallization conditions...|$|R

The mode largely responsible for <b>premature</b> bearing <b>wear</b> has been identified as adhesive/shear peeling of the upper layers of bearing balls and rings. This mode relies upon the mechanisms of scale formation, breakdown, and removal, all of which are greatly enhanced by the heavy oxidation environment of the HPOTP.
