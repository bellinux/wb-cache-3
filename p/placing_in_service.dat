40|$|Effective {{planning}} {{of the complex}} electricity supply network is essential because of the long lead times required for the development and <b>placing</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> of large new generators and transmission lines. Yet much can change while this physical process is being undertaken in terms of costs, prices, technological innovation and public policies, particularly about the environment and fuel diversity. The essential nature of well-constructed markets in yielding accurate, up-dated information about the likely effects of these many factors, {{as well as the}} use of advanced planning tools like “real-options” analysis are described, together with how these tools should be carefully staged and integrated with the planning process...|$|E
40|$|The Agency {{has a role}} to help {{facilitate}} the procedure for authorising the <b>placing</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> 1 of vehicles and the harmonisation of the National Safety Authorities decision making processes for authorisation. This is particularly important in the transition phase until all the Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs) are complete and all networks and vehicles conform to the TSIs. In this context this report {{is part of a}} suite of initiatives intended to facilitate vehicle authorisation. These initiatives include: defining and maintaining the list of parameters to be checked for vehicle authorisation compiling and maintaining the Reference Document that: o lists the national rules for each parameter; o describes the national legal framework covering the authorisation procedure, and o records the equivalence of the various national rules for each parameter. The Agency, under the auspices of its Cross Acceptance Working Party, set about understanding and documenting the different existing national authorisation procedures, their commonalities and differences. The analysis also identified technical subject areas of authorisation that generated the most cost, time delay and uncertainty. It soon became clear that as well as determining the “status quo ” of authorisation procedures used today, it was essential to have a common understanding of the new procedure contained within the recast Interoperability Directive. This led to the initiative with the European Commission to document a common understanding {{in the form of a}} Commission Recommendation (known as DV 29 [2]). This part of the Agency report (Part 1) is one of three documents foreseen to cover the authorisation procedure...|$|E
