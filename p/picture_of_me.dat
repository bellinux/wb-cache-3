2500|$|Clarkson {{has spoken}} highly of the Czech-made Škoda Yeti, calling it {{possibly}} the best {{car in the}} world, and used 20 minutes of a Top Gear episode putting the Yeti {{through a number of}} challenges to support his point. Clarkson called the Brera, Alfa's latest sports car, [...] "Cameron Diaz on wheels". Clarkson has expressed fondness for late-model V8 Holdens, available in the UK rebadged as Vauxhalls.

Webb replied [...] "I'd like {{to get them out of}} Iraq, Mr. President." [...] Bush responded, [...] "That's not what I asked you.

My barber was in the neighbouring house and I used to go there once a month to have a crew cut, [...] which was the fashion in those days. My friends and I were aged seven to ten and on our one-speed bikes we used to pin numbers on our back... and we never missed riding past Maurice Garin in a tight group so that he would see.

He began recording with Billy Sherrill in 1970, and Sherrill tried to keep Jones to record songs more toned to countrypolitan and not as loud. In 1970, his first hit with Sherrill was 1970's [...] "Good Year for the Roses" [...] which peaked at number 2. In 1971, he began to record with Tammy Wynette (whom he had married in 1970).
