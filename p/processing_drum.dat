50|$|As a guide, an {{exposure}} of one second to a 25 Watt incandescent lamp at two metres distance at {{around the end}} of the first minute of a 2-minute development can produce acceptable results. If the exposure is made with the developing print still in the tray of developer, it is important to stop agitation at least 10 seconds prior to exposure to allow any bubbles on the surface to disperse and to ensure that the print is lying flat. Solarising colour prints is more difficult because of the more careful control of temperature and timing that is required and because most amateur processing is undertaken in a <b>processing</b> <b>drum</b> rather than a dish.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{bottlenecks}} in {{the progress of the}} Music Information Retrieval (MIR) research field is the limited access to common, large and annotated audio databases that could serve for technology development and/or evaluation. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present in detail the ENST-Drums database, emphasizing on both the content and the recording process. This audiovisual database of drum performances by three professional drummers was recorded on 8 audio channels and 2 video channels. The drum sequences are fully annotated and will be, for a large part, freely distributed for research purposes. The large variety in its content should serve research in various domains of audio signal <b>processing</b> involving <b>drums,</b> ranging from single drum event classification to complex multimodal drum track transcription and extraction from polyphonic music...|$|R

Such parts as the workpiece material is soft, thin wall sleeve material, high precision, the rejection rate is relatively high in the actual production, the main reason is that the parts of high speed, large size, high precision, fixture design is not reasonable, precision caused by static part and dynamic accuracy after processing can not meet the cigarette equipment operation and cigarette process requirements...|$|R
40|$|The Waste Receiving And Processing {{facility}} (WRAP) {{adheres to}} providing gamma-ray spectroscopy instrument calibrations traceable to the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standard{sup (4) }. The detectors {{are used to}} produce quantitative results for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) and must meet calibration programmatic calibration goals. Instruments must meet portions of ANSI N 42. 14, 1978 guide for Germanium detectors. The Non-Destructive Assay (NDA) Gamma Energy Analysis (GEA) utilizes NIST traceable line source standards for the detector system calibrations. The counting configuration {{is a series of}} drums containing the line sources and different density filler matrices. The drums are used to develop system efficiencies with respect to density. The efficiency and density correction factors are required for the <b>processing</b> of <b>drummed</b> waste materials of similar densities. The calibration verification is carried out after the calibration is deemed final, by counting a second drum of NIST traceable sources. Three in-depth calibrations have been completed on one of the two systems to date, the first being the system acceptance plan. This report has a secondary function; that being the development of the instrument calibration errors which are to be folded into the Total Instrument Uncertainty document, HNF- 4050...|$|R
40|$|Since {{delivery}} of thefirst vacuum-column magnetic-tape transport in 1953 and thefirst movable-head disk drive in 1957, tape and disk devices in many configurations {{have been the}} principal means for storage of the large volumes of data required by data <b>processing</b> systems. Magnetic <b>drums</b> and other device geometries have also been important system components, but to a lesser extent. Over the past twenty-five years signijicant developments have been made that increase the capacity, reduce the cost, and improve the performance and reliability of these devices. With each improved device the range {{and nature of the}} applications undertaken have expanded and, in turn, led to a need for further device improvement. This paper gives a general review and historical perspective of magnetic storage development within IBM and is an introduction to the subsequent papers on disk, diskette, and tape technology and on disk manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|Coiler drums are {{integral}} {{components of the}} Steckel mill reversing hot strip rolling process. A Steckel mill produces hot rolled strip steel from cast slabs, which are heated before being converted, via roughing, to a transfer bar, of which the thickness is subsequently reduced to the desired gauge {{by means of a}} reverse rolling process performed by the Steckel mill. Coiler drums are located inside two Steckel furnaces, which are positioned {{on both sides of the}} mill stand. As the strip thickness is reduced during each pass, the length increases. In order to obtain high rolling speeds and retain temperature, the strip is successively coiled and uncoiled, under tension, onto and from the heated coiler <b>drums</b> during <b>processing.</b> As coiler <b>drums</b> have a high unit cost and a significant impact on the quality of the finished product, coiler drum performance is important to Steckel mill operators. The high cost is associated with the high alloy composition of the casting and the specialised manufacturing process required for the production of coiler drums. Deterioration of the coiler drum condition over its service lifespan can adversely affect the quality of the final product, namely coiled strip. This investigation was therefore undertaken to gain insight into coiler drum failure mechanisms, which will benefit Steckel mill operators, mill suppliers and coiler drum suppliers. Professor R. F. Laubsche...|$|R
40|$|Three DOT 6 M 30 -gallon drums are {{scheduled}} to be shipped from the Idaho Nuclear Technology Engineering Center (INTEC) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to L-Area at the Savannah River Site (SRS). These three drums contain radioactive materials that resulted from the material recovery effort following a small explosion that had occurred in the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) hot chemistry laboratory (HCL). In support of the shipment and subsequent storage of the three DOT 6 M drums, an evaluation of the potential for molecular hydrogen production in the drums has been completed and documented herein. The potential sources of hydrogen evaluated in the current report include radiolytic decomposition of polymeric materials in the DOT 6 M drums No. 3031 and No. 3598 and the radiolytic decomposition of water in drum No. 20102. No other potential sources have been identified based upon reported drum contents and packaging configuration. A parametric approach was used to evaluate the maximum quantity of molecular hydrogen that can be expected to evolve in two DOT 6 M 30 -gallon drums in support of receipt and subsequent interim storage prior to canyon <b>processing.</b> These <b>drums</b> are two of three drums scheduled for shipment from INTEC to SRS as part of the decommissioning effort of the INTEC facility. The three DOT 6 M drums will be received at L-Area in SRS and stored for up to 13 -years prior to final disposition at HB-Line in 2020. Results of the current analysis do not include parametric analysis of drum No. 20102 containing 114 / 133 SAL (salvage) which contains UO{sub 3 } powder. This drum has not been identified as containing polymeric materials and a conservative calculation indicates that the maximum gross molecular hydrogen production due to the radiolysis of adsorbed moisture would yield a production rate of 5. 1 -cm{sup 3 }/yr, driven primarily by the large surface are to volume ratio of the oxide powder. The remaining two drums, No. 3031 and No. 3598 contain polymer bags and/or bottles that will be subject to radiolytically induced hydrogen gas generation due to decomposition of the polymers. Conservative values for hydrogen gas generation rates and rates of pressure increase within the drums have been determined based upon a number of inputs and assumptions. The results are that hydrogen will be produced at a rate of 1. 93 -cm{sup 3 }/yr and 1. 50 -cm{sup 3 }/yr, respectively for drums No. 3031 and No. 3598. Projected molecular hydrogen concentrations at 2020 have been calculated to remain below the lower flammability limit of 4 % molecular hydrogen by volume in air...|$|R
