5|$|In 1917, Einstein {{applied the}} {{general theory of}} {{relativity}} to the structure of the universe as a whole.

As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe.

This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.|$|E

5|$|An {{economic}} downturn was beginning in Canada by 1958.

Minister of Finance Fleming and Bank of Canada Governor James Coyne proposed that the wartime Victory Bond issue, which constituted two-thirds of the national debt and which was due to be redeemed by 1967, be refinanced to a longer term. After considerable indecision on Diefenbaker's part, a nationwide campaign took place, and 90% of the bonds were converted.

5|$|Early in its life, forecasters had {{difficulties}} {{regarding the}} future track {{and intensity of}} Danielle, including a northeastward motion instead of its loop. After Danielle executed its loop, forecasters consistently <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> landfall along the northeastern North Carolina coastline. As a result, officials issued Tropical Storm Warnings for the coast of North Carolina on September 24, 36hours before the storm passed {{to the east of}} the state. The continued northward motion caught forecasters off guard, and consequentially tropical storm warnings were not issued for the Delmarva Peninsula until just 12hours before the storm made landfall. In addition, forecasters issued tropical storm warnings from Delaware through Watch Hill, Rhode Island, as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Jeanne {{steadily}} intensified as {{it turned}} eastward, developing a 52mi (83km) wide eye. A motion to the southeast began on September 22, and {{around the same time}} it reached winds of 100mph (160km/h), making it a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. At the same time, the National Hurricane Center forecast to turn westward and later northwestward, with its projected five-day track within 60mi (100km) of Cape Fear, North Carolina. The westernmost outlier during one model run was the NOGAPS model, which <b>predicted</b> <b>a</b> continued westward motion across central Florida. The official forecast changed early on September 23 to bring Jeanne across northeastern Florida, though initially the cyclone was predicted to turn northeastward and hit South Carolina as a hurricane.|$|E

Tropical storm warnings were also issued from Chincoteague to near Manasquan, New Jersey, including the Chesapeake and Delaware bays. The watches and warnings remained in place until August18. Despite the lack of landfall, the NHC deemed the watches and warnings as appropriate due to the projected track.|$|E

Though the forecast predicted above-average activity, the level predicted was significantly less than the 2004 season. On April 1, 2005, after confirming that El Niño conditions would not develop, Gray and his team revised the December forecast upward, expecting 13 tropical storms instead of 11 and seven hurricanes instead of six.

40|$|Abstract. While in the Standard Model top quarks are {{predicted}} {{to be produced}} unpolarized at the LHC, several models beyond the SM <b>predict</b> <b>a</b> non-zero polarisation. In particular, some of the models <b>predicting</b> <b>a</b> larger forward-backward tt ̄ asymmetry than the SM, as measured at the Tevatron, <b>predict</b> <b>a</b> positive top quark polar-isation. Using 4. 66 fb− 1 of data collected by the ATLAS experiment at a centre of mass energy of 7 TeV, a measurement of the top quark polarisation is presented. The full tt ̄ system is reconstructed from final states {{with at least one}} charged lepton, and a template fit to the distribution of the angle between the charged lepton and the top quark is performed to measure the top quark polarisation. In the Standard Model (SM) top quarks in top-antitop (tt̄) production are {{predicted to}} be produced unpolarized in proton-proton collisions at the LHC due to parity con-servation and an unpolarized initial state. However, sev-eral models beyond the SM <b>predict</b> <b>a</b> non-zero polarisa-tion [1 – 3], and among these some even <b>predicts</b> <b>a</b> larger forward-backward top-antitop asymmetry than the SM, as measured at the Tevatron [4 – 6]...|$|R
