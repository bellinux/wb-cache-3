On {{the other side of}} the lake, near the Bhutanatha temple, is a 7th-8th century Chalukya period cave of small dimensions. Inside, there is a carved statue seated over a sculpted throne with reliefs showing people holding chauris (fans), a <b>Pipal</b> <b>tree,</b> elephants, and lions in an attacking pose. On one side of the statue is a chakra, on the other a conch shell. The statue wears abundant jewelry and a thread over its chest. The face of this statue is damaged and missing its face.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} {{as to who}} the statue represents. One theory holds {{that it is a}} relief of the Buddha in a sitting posture. According to this theory, those holding the chauris are Bodhisattvas flanking the Buddha. According to George Michell, the halo, the <b>Pipal</b> <b>tree</b> and cloak-like dress suggests that this was originally a Buddha statue. The shrine, states this theory, was converted to Hindu worship in recent times. According to B.V. Shettiarchaeologist and curator of Prince of Wales Museum of Western India, the cave was not converted but from the start represented a tribute to Mayamoha of the Hindu Puranas, or Buddhavatara Vishnu (ninth avatar of Vishnu). This theory is supported by the chakra, conch and jewelry included in its iconography. The style suggests it was likely carved in or before the 8thcentury.|$|E

25|$|The Kodandarama temple complex lies {{near the}} Tungabhadra River, and is north of Achyutaraya temple. The temple overlooks Chakratirtha, where the Tungabhadra turns northwards towards the Himalayas. The river banks, {{considered}} holy, accommodate a Vijayanagara-era ghat and mandapa facilities for bathing. In {{front of the}} temple is a dipa stambha (lighting pillar) under a <b>Pipal</b> <b>tree,</b> and inside is a sanctum dedicated to Rama, Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman. Nearby, and continuing until Kotitirtha to its north, {{are a number of}} smaller shrines, dedicated to Vitthala, Anjaneya, Shiva linga and other deities. On the rock face are reliefs of Anantashayana Vishnu (reclining Vishnu creating the cosmic cycle, Ranganatha), friezes narrating the legends of Narasimha and Prahlada, and the twenty-four avatars of Vishnu according to the Puranic tradition of Vaishnavism.

50|$|Growth {{of trees}} and other {{vegetation}} on the superstructure, particularly on the mastaka of the temple create problem to the monument.

50|$|The wild grass, creepers and <b>pipal</b> <b>trees</b> {{growing on}} the beki of the temple cause {{serious threat to the}} monument. The {{vegetation}} needs to be removed immediately. The cracks and gaps in the dry stone masonry should be sealed to check water seepage. The monument406 suffocates because of encroachment of residential buildings from three sides. Because of the encroachments from all the sides including the road in the front, the rain water stagnates within the temple precinct. Provision needs to be made to drain out the rainwater.

These nine temples of Pidha order enshrine the Siva lingam in the sanctum. According to the Matha legend these temples are dedicated to the previous Matha Mahantas in recognition of their contribution and religious merits. These shrines have been erected upon the burial of the deceased Mahantas, which was an interesting and important Matha tradition in the past. These shrines have been named as burial temples to distinguish them from the other temples.|$|R

60|$|In Northern India stood {{a monastery}} called The Chubara of Dhunni Bhagat. No one remembered {{who or what}} Dhunni Bhagat had been. He had lived his life, made a little money and spent it all, as every good Hindu should do, on a work of piety--the Chubara. That was full of brick cells, gaily painted with the figures of Gods and kings and elephants, where {{worn-out}} priests could sit and meditate on the latter end of things; the paths were brick paved, and the naked feet of thousands had worn them into gutters. Clumps of mangoes sprouted from between the bricks; great <b>pipal</b> <b>trees</b> overhung the well-windlass that whined all day; and hosts of parrots tore through the trees. Crows and squirrels were tame in that place, for they knew that never a priest would touch them.|$|R
