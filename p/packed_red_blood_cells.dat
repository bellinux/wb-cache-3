40|$|OBJECTIVES: This article {{summarizes}} the current data on <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> transfusion in the pediatric {{intensive care unit}} setting to help providers make evidence-based decisions regarding <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> transfusions. DATA SOURCES: Review of the literature, including PubMed, citations from relevant articles, and some articles that have been particularly relevant in adult critical care practice regarding <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: The use of <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> transfusions is common in the pediatric intensive care unit setting. However, until recently there have been little data to guide providers in this practice. Studies in adult intensive care units have shown less favorable outcomes in patients who received <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> transfusions. This has led to renewed questioning {{of the practice of}} <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> transfusion in critically ill pediatric patients. New data indicate that using a hemoglobin transfusion threshold of 3 ̆e 7 g/dL does not yield improved outcomes. Furthermore, smaller studies have suggested that pediatric intensive care unit patients may be at an increased risk for morbidity and mortality when undergoing transfusion...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveCardiac {{surgery is}} {{a major cause of}} acute kidney injury. In this setting, receipt of blood transfusions seems to be {{associated}} with a higher risk of acute kidney injury, as measured using serum creatinine values. We examined this association further by using urinary biomarkers of kidney injury. MethodsA total of 1210 adults underwent cardiac surgery and were divided into 3 groups {{on the basis of the}} receipt of intraoperative <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> units: no <b>blood</b> (n =  894), 2 or less <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> units (n =  206), and more than 2 <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> units (n =  110). Acute kidney injury was defined as (1) doubling of serum creatinine from the preoperative value; (2) first postoperative urinary interleukin- 18 in the fifth quintile; and (3) first postoperative urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in the fifth quintile. We determined the relative risk for acute kidney injury outcome according to <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> units group after adjusting for 12 preoperative and surgical variables. By using the Sobel test for mediation analysis, we also evaluated the role of biomarkers in causing acute kidney injury through alternative pathways. ResultsAcute kidney injury was more common in those who received more than 2 <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> units.  In patients receiving more than 2 <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> units, the adjusted relative risks were 2. 3 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 2 - 4. 4, P. 01), 1. 36 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 - 1. 9, P. 05), and 1. 34 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 - 1. 8, P. 06) for doubling of serum creatinine, urinary interleukin- 18 in the fifth quintile (> 60 pg/mL), and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in the fifth quintile (> 102 ng/mL), respectively. Furthermore, the effect of <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> units transfusion on acute kidney injury was partially mediated by interleukin- 18. ConclusionsReceipt of 2 or more <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> units during cardiac surgery is associated with a greater risk of acute kidney injury defined by serum creatinine and kidney injury biomarkers...|$|R

25|$|Red {{blood cells}} can be {{obtained}} from whole blood by centrifugation, which separates the cells from the blood plasma in a process known as blood fractionation. <b>Packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> which are made in this way from whole blood with the plasma removed, are used in transfusion medicine. During plasma donation, the red blood cells are pumped back into the body right away and only the plasma is collected.|$|E
25|$|As no {{intravenous}} fluids used for initial resuscitation {{have been shown}} to be superior, warmed Lactated Ringer's solution continues to be the solution of choice. If blood products are needed, a greater use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets relative to <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> has been found to improve survival and lower overall blood product use; a ratio of 1:1:1 is recommended. The success of platelets has been attributed to the fact that they may prevent coagulopathy from developing. Cell salvage and autotransfusion also may be used.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} for benefit of blood transfusions in GI bleed is poor with some evidence finding harm. In those in shock O-negative <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> are recommended. If {{large amounts of}} pack red blood cells are used additional platelets and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should be administered to prevent coagulopathies. In alcoholics FFP is suggested before confirmation of a coagulopathy due to presumed blood clotting problems. Evidence supports holding off on blood transfusions in {{those who have a}} hemoglobin greater than 7 to 8 g/dL and moderate bleeding, including in those with preexisting coronary artery disease.|$|E
30|$|The {{effect of}} <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> (pRBC) {{transfusion}} to treat anemia on outcomes is not known. Specifically, there are conflicting reports regarding {{the association between}} transfusion and outcome after ICH, (Sheth et al. 2011; Diedler et al. 2010) and to our knowledge there is little published data evaluating the effect of aggressive treatment of anemia on hematoma volume or expansion following ICH.|$|R
25|$|If {{large amounts}} of <b>pack</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> are used {{additional}} platelets and fresh frozen plasma should be administered to prevent coagulopathies.

40|$|BackgroundOxidative {{stress from}} surgery or {{critically}} illness {{has been shown}} to adversely contribute to morbidity and mortality.

25|$|In transfusions of <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> {{individuals}} with type O Rh D negative blood are often called universal donors. Those with type AB Rh D positive blood are called universal recipients. However, these terms are only generally true {{with respect to}} possible reactions of the recipient's anti-A and anti-B antibodies to transfused red blood cells, and also possible sensitization to Rh D antigens. One exception is {{individuals with}} hh antigen system (also known as the Bombay phenotype) who can only receive blood safely from other hh donors, because they form antibodies against the H antigen present on all red blood cells.|$|E
25|$|Although {{patients}} {{at high risk}} of bleeding were excluded from the phase III clinical study (PROWESS), 25% of patients treated with drotrecogin and 18% of those receiving placebo experienced at least one bleeding event (principally ecchymoses or GI bleeding) during the 28-day study period. During treatment serious bleeding events (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage, any life-threatening bleeding event, any bleeding event requiring administration of at least 3 units of <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> daily for 2 consecutive days) occurred in 2.4% of patients treated with drotrecogin and in 1% of those receiving placebo. No significant differences between geriatric patients and younger patients regarding bleeding events in the drotrecogin group have been found.|$|E
25|$|Red {{blood cells}} {{may be given}} {{as part of a}} blood transfusion. Blood may be donated from another person, or stored by the {{recipient}} at an earlier date. Donated blood usually requires screening to ensure that donors do not contain risk factors for the presence of blood-borne diseases, or will not suffer themselves by giving blood. Blood is usually collected and tested for common or serious Blood-borne diseases including Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV. The blood type (A, B, AB, or O) or the blood product is identified. This relates to the presence of antigens on the cell's surface. After this process, the blood is stored, and within a short duration is used. Blood can be given as a whole product or the red blood cells separated as <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|E

25|$|Long-term {{transfusion}} {{therapy to}} maintain the patient’s hemoglobin level above 9-10 g/dL (normal levels are 13.8 for males, and 12.1 for females). Patients are transfused by meeting strict criteria ensuring their safety. They must have: confirmed laboratory diagnosis of thalassemia major, and hemoglobin levels less than 7g/dL, {{to be eligible for}} the transfusion. To ensure quality blood transfusions, the <b>packed</b> <b>red</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> should be leucoreduced with a minimum of 40g of hemoglobin content. By having leucoreduced blood packets, the patient is at a lower risk to develop adverse reactions by contaminated white cells and preventing platelet alloimmunisation. Pre-storage filtration of whole blood offers high efficiency for removal and low residual of leukocytes; It is the preferred method of leucoreduction compared to pre-transfusion and bedside filtration. Patients with allergic transfusion reactions or unusual red cell antibodies must received “washed red cells” or “cryopreserved red cells.” Washed red cells have been removed of plasma proteins that would have become a target of the patient’s antibodies allowing the transfusion to be carried out safely. Cryopreserved red cells are used to maintain a supply of rare donor units for patients with unusual red cell antibodies or missing common red cell antigens. The transfusion programs available involve lifelong regular blood transfusion to main the pre-transfusion hemoglobin level above 9-10 g/gL. The monthly transfusions promote normal growth, physical activities, suppress bone marrow activity, and minimize iron accumulation.|$|E
