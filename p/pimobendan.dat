This condition {{is known to be}} inherited in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. [...] Degenerative valve disease is {{the most common form of}} heart disease in dogs. [...] Mitral insufficiency leads to turbulent blood flow and increased pressure in the left atrium.

[...] Decreased output of blood by the left ventricle causes the body to compensate by increasing sympathetic tone and activating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). [...] Increased sympathetic tone leads to increased peripheral vascular resistance and increased heart rate and contractility of the heart muscle. [...] Chronic elevation of sympathetic tone damages the heart muscle. [...] Activation of the RAAS results in increased retention of water and sodium by the kidneys, vasoconstriction, and other effects that result in increased blood volume.

50|$|<b>Pimobendan</b> {{is absorbed}} rapidly when given via the oral route {{and has a}} {{bioavailability}} of 60-65%. Bioavailability is markedly decreased when ingested with food. It is metabolized into an active metabolite (desmethylpimobendan) by the liver. The parent compound, <b>pimobendan,</b> is a potent calcium sensitizer while desmethylpimobendan is a more potent phosphodiesterase III inhibitor. The half-life of <b>pimobendan</b> in the blood is 0.4 hours and the half-life of its metabolite is 2 hours. Elimination is by excretion in the bile and then feces. <b>Pimobendan</b> is 90-95% bound to plasma proteins in circulation.

50|$|<b>Pimobendan</b> is a {{positive}} inotrope (increases myocardial contractility).

40|$|PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the effects of <b>pimobendan</b> 2. 5 and 5 mg daily on exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure. DESIGN: A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial of the addition of <b>pimobendan</b> to conventional treatment with a minimum follow up of 24 weeks. SETTING: Outpatient cardiology clinics in six European countries. PATIENTS: 317 patients with stable symptomatic heart failure, objectively impaired exercise capacity, and an ejection fraction of 45 % or lower who were treated with at least an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and a diuretic and who tolerated a test dose of <b>pimobendan.</b> RESULTS: Compared with placebo, both <b>pimobendan</b> 2. 5 and 5 mg daily improved exercise duration (bicycle ergometry) by 6 % (P = 0. 03 and 0. 05) after 24 weeks of treatment. At that time 63 % of patients allocated to <b>pimobendan</b> and 59 % of those allocated to placebo were alive and able to exercise to at least the same level as at entry (P = 0. 5).

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to examine the effects of}} <b>pimobendan</b> in a murine model of viral myocarditis in relation to proinflammatory cytokine production and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in the heart. BACKGROUNDPimobendan has been recently confirmed to improve both acute and chronic heart failure. Since the modulation of myocardial necrosis and contractile dysfunction by various proinflammatory cytokines may be partially mediated by the production of nitric oxide, the effects of <b>pimobendan</b> on the production of proinflammatory cytokines and NO were investigated in an animal model of viral myocarditis involving heart failure. METHODSDBA/ 2 mice were inoculated with the encephalomyocarditis virus. To observe its effect on survival up to 14 days, <b>pimobendan</b> (0. 1 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg) or vehicles were given from the day of virus inoculation (day 0) orally once daily. The effects of <b>pimobendan</b> on histological changes, cytokine production, NO production and iNOS gene expression in the heart were studied in mice treated either with <b>pimobendan,</b> 1 mg/kg or with vehicles only, and sacrificed seven days after virus inoculation. RESULTSThe survival of mice improved in a dose-dependent fashion such that a significant difference (p < 0. 02) was found between the higher-dose <b>pimobendan</b> group (20 of 30 [66. 7 %]) and the control group (11 of 30 [36. 7 %]). Histological scores for cellular infiltration (1. 1 ± 0. 1 vs. 2. 0 ± 0. 0, p < 0. 001), intracardiac tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α (18. 2 ± 1. 8 vs. 35. 8 ± 4. 2 pg/mg heart, p < 0. 001) and interleukin (IL) - 1 β (9. 3 ± 1. 2 vs. 26. 6 ± 7. 1 pg/mg heart, p < 0. 01) were significantly lower in the mice given <b>pimobendan</b> versus those of the control mice. Interleukin- 6 levels (7. 1 ± 0. 8 vs. 9. 2 ± 1. 9 pg/mg heart) were also lower in the mice treated with <b>pimobendan.</b> Furthermore, intracardiac NO production was significantly (p < 0. 001) less in the <b>pimobendan</b> group (0. 165 ± 0. 004 nmol/mg heart) than in the control group (0. 291 ± 0. 051 nmol/mg heart), and intracardiac iNOS gene expression in the mice given <b>pimobendan</b> was 74 % lower than it was in the control animals (p < 0. 01).

40|$|Background: Despite {{traditional}} therapy of a diuretic, {{angiotensin converting}} enzyme inhibitor, digoxin, {{or a combination of}} these drugs, survival of dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is low. <b>Pimobendan,</b> an inodilator, has both inotropic and balanced peripheral vasodilatory properties. Hypothesis: <b>Pimobendan</b> when added to conventional therapy will improve morbidity and reduce case fatality rate in Doberman Pinschers with congestive heart failure (CHF) caused by DCM. Animals: Sixteen Doberman Pinschers in CHF caused by DCM. Methods: A prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with treatment failure as the primary and quality of life (QoL) indices as secondary outcome variables. Therapy consisted of furosemide (per os [PO] as required) and benazepril hydrochloride (0. 5 mg/kg PO q 12 h) and dogs were randomized in pairs and by sex to receive <b>pimobendan</b> (0. 25 mg/ kg PO q 12 h) or placebo (1 tablet PO q 12 h).

40|$|Inotropic {{support for}} the failing {{myocardium}} as the therapy for xi congestive heart failure (CHF) is intended to achieve an increase in cardiac output via positive responses in myocardial contractility and vasodilation. A novel approach to differentiate these two responses {{is the use of}} an animal with an implanted total artificial heart (TAH). Three inotropic drugs, dobutamine, enoximone, and <b>pimobendan,</b> were tested in eight animals with their natural heart intact and five animals implanted with a TAH. Baseline values of the TAH and natural heart (NH) were compared to determine their hemodynamic similarities. Each of the three drugs was given randomly to the animals in dosages similar to human clinical doses. Peak responses were recorded and analyzed. All three drugs caused an increase in contractility and cardiac output in the NH animals. Dobutamine and <b>pimobendan</b> also caused a significant increase in heart rate at higher dosages whereas enoximone did not. Dobutamine caused an increase in left ventricle work, as did <b>pimobendan</b> at the first dose given; at higher doses of <b>pimobendan,</b> the left ventricular work returned to baseline. However, at the doses tested, the left ventricular stroke work during enoximone administration decreased. Vasodilation (the only drug stimulation response in the TAH model) was also observed with the administration of the drugs in T AH animals, and all three caused decreases in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. Dobutamine and <b>pimobendan</b> caused an increase in left and right atrial pressures (because of the mechanical heart not being adjusted to compensate the increased return). There was also a reduction in systemic and pulmonary resistance. Enoximone caused severe pulmonary hypertension in the TAH animals, possibly due to stimulus of platelets to release vasoconstrictive substances. Thus, dobutamine, enoximone, and <b>pimobendan</b> significantly contribute to increases in output by vasodilation in animals with a natural heart. Similarly, dobutamine and <b>pimobendan</b> 2 ̆ 7 s vasodilatory action is identified in an animal with a TAH.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] <b>Pimobendan,</b> a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor and calcium channel sensitizing agent, was hypothesized to decrease the severity of pulmonary hypertension (PHT) in a prospective short-term, double-blinded, crossover design, with a long-term, open-label component. Ten dogs with a peak tricuspid regurgitant pressure gradient (TRPG) [greater than or equal to] 50 mmHg on echocardiogram were enrolled. PHT was secondary to myxomatous valve disease in 8 of the dogs, and chronic pulmonary disease in 2. Dogs were examined on days 0, 14, 21, 35, and 91. In the 35 -day short-term phase, dogs were randomly allocated to receive either placebo or <b>pimobendan</b> (0. 18 - 0. 3 mg/kg, PO q 12 h) for 14 days. Following a 1 week washout, the dogs received the alternative treatment for 14 days. All dogs then received <b>pimobendan</b> for 8 weeks. Data was analyzed using a two-period crossover design. Short-term comparison of <b>pimobendan</b> vs. placebo: All dogs had a decreased peak TRPG on <b>pimobendan</b> therapy in comparison to placebo (p= 0. 0061), with a mean decrease of 16. 37 ± 12. 89 mmHg. All dogs demonstrated a significant decrease in NT-proBNP levels while receiving <b>pimobendan</b> (p= 0. 0023), with a mean difference of 708. 8 ± 508. 6 pmol/L. A significant improvement in the summed QOL score was noted in 9 / 10 dogs (p= 0. 016). Long-term comparison of day 0 vs. 91 : 9 / 10 dogs showed a decreased peak TRPG (p= 0. 03), with a mean decrease of 14. 0 ± 15. 6 mmHg. No significant changes in NT-proBNP levels (p= 0. 34) or the summed QOL scores (p= 0. 41) were seen. Failure to show improvement may be secondary to progressive disease or the small sample size...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pimobendan</b> (UD-CG 115) is a long-acting {{positive}} inotropic drug with arterio- and venodilator properties. To determine to {{what extent}} this new agent is able to affect contractile function in previously ischemic areas of the left ventricle (LV), the effects of <b>pimobendan</b> on global and regional LV function were studied in eight conscious dogs, 2 days after a 2 -h coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion. Before <b>pimobendan,</b> percentage of systolic shortening and mean velocity of shortening were lower in reperfused segments than in control areas (0. 41 +/- 0. 17 vs. 0. 93 +/- 0. 07 s- 1 and 7 +/- 3 vs. 15 +/- 1 %, respectively; both p less than 0. 05). Infusion of 1 mg of <b>pimobendan</b> significantly improved peak + dP/dt (3202 +/- 372 to 3848 +/- 498 mm Hg/s; p less than 0. 05) and ejection time (166 +/- 13 to 156 +/- 15 ms; p less than 0. 05). Cumulative infusion up to 2. 5 mg further improved these indexes to 5199 +/- 934 mm Hg/s and to 125 +/- 11 ms, (respectively; both p less than 0. 05) without affecting mean arterial pressure (91 +/- 14 to 93 +/- 22 mm Hg; NS). Mean velocity of shortening rose to 1. 18 +/- 0. 09 s- 1 (p less than 0. 05) in control segments and to 0. 62 +/- 0. 18 s- 1 (p less than 0. 05) in reperfused segments. The ratio between end-systolic pressure and length increased by 26 +/- 9 % (p less than 0. 05) in the reperfused segments and by 20 +/- 8 % (p less than 0. 05) in control areas.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the clinical efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>pimobendan</b> by comparing it with ramipril over a six-month period in dogs with mild to moderate heart failure (HF) caused by myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). Methods: This was a prospective randomised, single-blind, parallel-group trial. Client-owned dogs (n= 43) with mild to moderate HF caused by MMVD {{were randomly assigned to}} one of two groups, which received either <b>pimobendan</b> (P dogs) or ramipril (R dogs) for six months. The outcome measures studied were: adverse HF outcome, defined as failure to complete the trial as a direct consequence of HF; maximum furosemide dose (mg/kg/day) administered during the study period; and any requirement for additional visits to the clinic as a direct consequence of HF. Results: Treatment with <b>pimobendan</b> was well tolerated compared with treatment with ramipril. P dogs were 25 per cent as likely as R dogs to have an adverse HF outcome (odds ratio 4. 09, 95 per cent confidence interval 1. 03 to 16. 3, P= 0. 046). Clinical Significance: R dogs had a higher overall score and thus may have had more advanced disease than P dogs at baseline (P= 0. 04). These results should be interpreted cautiously but such a high odds ratio warrants further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and the effectiveness of therapy using recently investigated echocardiographic parameters. PAH is characterized by the progressive elevation of pulmonary artery pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction, which ultimately results in right-sided heart failure and death. Echocardiography results and invasive measurements of right and left ventricular systolic pressures were compared after 3 -week administrations of sildenafil (S group), <b>pimobendan</b> (P group), nicorandil (N group), and their combinations (SP and SPN groups) in male rats with monocrotaline (MCT) -induced pulmonary hyper-tension (M group) and without this condition (C group). The groups that received <b>pimobendan</b> alone and in combinations (SP and SPN groups) showed improvement in their echocardiographic parameters of systolic function. A significant improvement of diastolic function was achieved in the SPN group. Invasive measurements showed the most significant decreases of right ventricular systolic pressure in the N and SPN groups, and the use of <b>pimobendan</b> resulted in a comparatively low risk of adverse hemodynamic effects (left ventricular systolic pressure). Although our results suggested the attenuation of PAH severity in all treatment groups, PAH could not be reversed.

40|$|We {{compared}} {{the effects of}} <b>pimobendan</b> (0. 25 mg/kg i. v.), a Ca 11 sensitizer, with some phosphodiesterase-III inhibition ef-fects, and amrinone (1 mg/kg plus 10 mg/kg/min i. v.), a PDE-III inhibitor, on left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic perfor-mance, both at rest and during exercise, in seven conscious dogs before and after pacing-induced congestive heart failure (CHF). Before CHF, under resting conditions, both <b>pimobendan</b> and amrinone caused a similar significant decrease in left ven-tricle size and end-systolic pressure, arterial elastance, and the time constant of LV relaxation. Similar results were obtained during exercise.

40|$|This {{retrospective}} study reports the survival time [onset {{of congestive heart}} failure (CHF) to death from any cause] of 21 dogs with mitral regurgitation (MR) and CHF treated with a combination of furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI, benazepril, or enalapril), <b>pimobendan,</b> spironolactone, and amlodipine. Baseline echocardiographic data: end-systolic and end-diastolic volume indices (ESVI and EDVI), left atrium to aorta ratio (LA/Ao), and regurgitant fraction (RF) are reported. Median survival time (MST) was 430 d. Initial dosage of furosemide (P = 0. 0081) and LA/Ao (P = 0. 042) were negatively associated with survival. Baseline echocardiographic indices (mean ± standard deviation) were 40. 24 ± 16. 76 for ESVI, 161. 48 ± 44. 49 mL/m 2 for EDVI, 2. 11 ± 0. 75 for LA/Ao, and 64. 71 ± 16. 85 % for RF.

40|$|It {{is unknown}} how cardiac {{stimulation}} by Ca 2 + sensitization modulates the cardiovascular response to exercise when left ventricular (LV) function is chronically depressed following a myocardial infarction. We therefore investigated {{the effects of}} EMD 57033 at rest and during exercise and compared these {{to those of the}} mixed Ca 2 +-sensitizer/phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor <b>pimobendan.</b> Pigs were chronically instrumented for measurement of cardiovascular performance. At the time of instrumentation, infarction was produced by coronary artery ligation (MI, n= 12). Studies in MI were performed in the awake state, 2 [*]–[*] 3 weeks after infarction. MI were characterized by a lower resting cardiac output (18 %), stroke volume (30 %) and LVdP/dtmax (18 %), and a doubling of LV end-diastolic pressure, compared to normal pigs (N, n= 13). In 11 resting MI, intravenous EMD 57033 (0. 2 [*]–[*] 0. 8 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]min− 1) increased LVdP/dtmax (57 ± 5 %) and stroke volume (26 ± 6 %) with no effect on heart rate, LV filling pressure, and myocardial O 2 -consumption, similar to N. In MI, the effects of EMD 57033 (0. 4 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]min− 1, IV) on stroke volume and LVdP/dtmax were maintained during treadmill exercise up to 85 % of maximal heart rate, while heart rate was lower compared to control exercise (all P< 0. 05). In contrast, the effects of EMD 57033 gradually waned in N at increasing intensity of exercise. Compared to N, the cardiostimulatory effects of <b>pimobendan</b> (20 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 [*]min− 1, IV) were blunted in MI both at rest and during exercise compared to N. In conclusion, the positive inotropic actions of the Ca 2 + sensitizer EMD 57033 are unmitigated in resting and exercising MI compared to N, while those of the mixed Ca 2 +-sensitizer/phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor <b>pimobendan</b> are blunted...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of acidosis on the positive inotropic effect of UD-CG 212 Cl { 4, 5 -dihydro- 6 -[2 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 1 H-benzimidazole- 5 -yl]- 5 -methyl- 3 (2 H) -pyridazinone}, an ac-tive metabolite of <b>pimobendan,</b> in canine ventricular trabeculae loaded with aequorin. The positive inotropic effect of UD-CG 212 Cl was markedly suppressed under acidotic conditions. The maximal contractile response to UD-CG 212 Cl was at-tained at 105 M {{in the control condition}} at pH 7. 4, but was not achieved even at 104 M during acidosis. The maximal inotro-pic effect of UD-CG 212 Cl was 18 % of the maximal response to isoproterenol (ISOmax) in association with an increase in Ca 2 transients of 7 % of ISOmax in the control, while they are 8 and 6 % of ISOmax under acidosis, respectively. Acidosis abol-ished the increase in myofilament Ca 2 sensitivity induced by UD-CG 212 Cl, whereas the increase in Ca 2 transients in-duced by the compound was not affected by acidosis. In con-clusion, UD-CG 212 Cl elicited a positive inotropic effect even under acidosis, however, UD-CG 212 Cl was much less effec-tive as a cardiotonic agent under acidosis mainly due to a decrease in the Ca 2 -sensitizing effect under acidotic condi-tion. Cardiotonic agents are indispensable for improvement of contractile dysfunction in heart failure. <b>Pimobendan</b> {UD-CG 115 BS; 4, 5 -dihydro- 6 -[2 -(p-methoxyphenyl) - 5 -benzimida-zolyl]- 5 -methyl- 3 (2 H) -pyridazinone} is a unique cardiotonic agent that has already been launched for treatment of pa-tients with heart failure (Hagemeijer, 1993). It has an inhib-itory action on phosphodiesterase III (Scholz and Meyer, 1986) and prolongs the action potential duration (Honerjäger et al., 1984). A part of the increase in force of contraction {{has been shown to be}} due to the myofilament Ca 2 sensitization (Fujino et al., 1988; Scheld et al., 1989; Böhm et al., 1991).

40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} {{effects of}} the pyridazinone-derivatives <b>pimobendan</b> and its O-demethylmetabolite UD-CG 212 Cl (2 -(4 -hydroxy-phenyl) - 5 -(5 -methyl- 3 -oxo- 4, 5 -dihydro- 2 H- 6 -pyridazinyl) benzimidazole HCl) were studied in conscious pigs, employing consecutive intravenous 10 min infusions of 10, 25, 50 and 100 micrograms kg- 1 min- 1 and 2, 4 and 8 micrograms kg- 1 min- 1 respectively. <b>Pimobendan</b> caused dose-dependent increases in LVdP/dtmax (up to 115 %) and heart rate (up to 30 %), while cardiac output was slightly elevated (up to 15 %) and stroke volume decreased by 12 %. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased in a dose-related manner from 8. 7 +/- 1. 0 mmHg to 2. 7 +/- 1. 7 mmHg. Mean arterial blood pressure was not significantly affected because systemic vascular resistance decreased dose-dependently up to 15 %. After beta-adrenoceptor blockade, the pimobendan-induced increases in heart rate and cardiac output were attenuated {{and the increase in}} LVdP/dtmax almost abolished. The responses of left ventricular end-diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance and stroke volume were not modified. UD-CG 212 Cl caused dose-related increases in LVdP/dtmax (up to 100 %) and heart rate (up to 25 %). Cardiac output was minimally elevated (up to 8 %) as stroke volume decreased dose-dependently up to 15 %. As systemic vascular resistance decreased up to 12 %, mean arterial blood pressure was slightly reduced (5 %). Left ventricular end-diastolic blood pressure decreased dose-dependently from 9. 0 +/- 0. 8 mmHg to 3. 8 +/- 1. 3 mmHg. After beta-adrenoceptor blockade, the UD-CG 212 Cl-induced increases in heart rate and LVdP/dtmax were attenuated and almost abolished and amounted up to 15 % and 20 %, respectively. The responses of the other systemic haemodynamic parameters were not significantly modified. We conclude that <b>pimobendan</b> and UD-CG 212 Cl are compounds with marked positive inotropic and venodilator properties in the conscious pig. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Pimobendan</b> (PIMO) {{is a novel}} inodilator {{that has}} shown {{promising}} results {{in the treatment of}} advanced mitral valve disease (MVD), but little is known about its hemodynamic effects, especially regarding the mitral regurgitant volume in naturally occurring MVD. Hypothesis: The addition of <b>pimobendan</b> to treatment decreases the regurgitant fraction (RF) in dogs with asymptomatic MVD. Animals: Twenty-four client-owned dogs affected by International Small Animal Cardiac Health Council class Ib MVD. Methods: Prospective, blinded, and controlled clinical trial. Dogs were assigned to a PIMO treatment group (n 5 19) (0. 2 – 0. 3 mg/kg q 12 h) or a control group (n 5 5). Echocardiographic evaluations were performed over a 6 -month period. Results: The addition of PIMO to treatment did not decrease the RF of dogs affected by asymptomatic class 1 b MVD over the study period (P 5. 85). There was {{a significant increase in the}} ejection fraction of the PIMO treated dogs at 30 days (80. 8 1. 42 versus 69. 0 2. 76, corrected P 5. 0064), and a decrease in systolic left ventricular diameter (corrected P 5. 011) within the PIMO group compared with baseline. However, this improvement in systolic function was not sustained over the 6 -month trial period.
