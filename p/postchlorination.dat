30|$|Sampling was {{conducted}} monthly between the 10 th and 20 th each sampling day from October 2011 to September 2012 from two selected treatment plants in Beheira Governorate, Egypt. These plants are Edfina plant (Plant 1) and Kom-Hamada plant (Plant 2). These treatment plants {{were selected to}} cover different points of surface water in Beheira Governorate. Chlorine disinfection and conventional treatment processes are used in both plants. Conventional treatment processes phases were prechlorination, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and <b>postchlorination.</b> The prechlorination was applied in the coagulation channels and the <b>postchlorination</b> was applied before the entrance of water to finished water reservoir in the distribution system.|$|E
40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{the problem of}} disinfection in an urban context and recommends actions to improve the living conditions of the population. The problems and failures of disinfection begin at the catchment {{with the quality of}} the source, which often needs prechlorination to reduce faecal contamination; <b>postchlorination</b> eliminates the bacteria remaining after treatment. Poor handling of chlorinators, maintenance and the personnel involved are additional factors that lead to failures. The problems and failures in water distribution are related to the handling of valves, prolonged storage, and pipes with slime, bulges and biofilm, which house bacteria and free-living organisms that can carry pathogens. Recommendations include: standardization of chlorination processes, continuous <b>postchlorination,</b> continuity in water distribution insofar as this is possible, pipe maintenance and the replacement of pipes found to be in poor condition. 1.

40|$|Seven {{drinking}} water treatment plants were sampled {{twice a month}} for 12 months to evaluate the removal of indicator bacteria and cytopathogenic enteric viruses. Samples were obtained at each level of treatment: raw water, <b>postchlorination,</b> postsedimentation, postfiltration, postozonation, and finished (tap) water. Raw water quality was usually poor, with total coliform counts exceeding 105 to 106 CFU/liter and the average virus count in raw water of 3. 3 most probable number of cytopathogenic units (MPNCU) /liter; several samples contained more than 100 MPNCU/liter. All plants distributed finished water that was essentially free of indicator bacteria as judged by analysis of 1 liter for total coliforms, fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The total plate counts at 20 and 35 degrees C were also evaluated {{as a measure of}} the total microbial population and were usually very low. Viruses were detected in 7 % (11 of 155) of the finished water samples (1, 000 liters) at an average density of 0. 0006 MPNCU/liter the highest virus density measured being 0. 2 MPNCU/liter. The average cumulative virus reduction was 95. 15 % after sedimentation and 99. 97 % after filtration and did not significantly decrease after ozonation or final chlorination. The viruses isolated from treated waters were all enteroviruses: poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, coxsackievirus types B 3, B 4, and B 5, echovirus type 7, and untyped picornaviruses...|$|E
40|$|Several {{types of}} cyanotoxins found in surface water bodies are {{recognized}} as having human health effects, whereas taste and odor affect the palatability of water and give rise to public complaints. Conventional water treatment unit operations may be effective in removing the cyanobacteria cells, but cyanotoxins and dissolved organics are not targeted for removal by them. Special treatment units need to be introduced {{to deal with these}} substances and attention paid to the process design as many operational issues may be encountered. We used a water supply project in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka as a case study to investigate the performance of unit operations in water reatment plants for which the source is shallow surface water sources with high inflows of nutrients. The present case study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of prechlorination, activated carbon adsorption, dissolved air flotation (DAF), filtration and disinfection in removal of cyanotoxins, and taste and odor causing dissolved organic substances from the source water. Raw water quality was evaluated using algal concentration, algal toxin concentration, and chemical oxygen demand. To evaluate the efficacy of treatment operations, the sequence of initial unit operation was changed on each day as with prechlorination and with powdered activated carbon (PAC), with prechlorination and without PAC, without prechlorination and with PAC, and without prechlorination and without PAC. In addition, laboratory analysis was done to obtain adsorption isotherms using three types of different PAC. The primary findings of our study were that PAC was effective in removal of Microcystin and chemical oxygen demand (COD) but needs to be optimized by providing sufficient contact time, and prechlorination does not improve the performance, whereas <b>postchlorination</b> is effective in removing any traces of Microcystin left after PAC. 001 : 10. 10611 (ASCE) HZ. 21 S 3 -SS 1 S. 0000114. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|E
40|$|Cette étude de {{laboratoire}} a eu pour but d'examiner la réactivité du bioxyde de chlore sur un acide humique d'origine aquatique en solution aqueuse et en milieu neutre (pH = 7, 5) et de préciser en particulier l'incidence d'une préoxydation chimique au CIO 2 sur les potentiels de formation de composés organohalogénés (trihalométhanes, acides dicloroacétique et trichloroacétique, chlore organiquement lié) et sur l'adsorbabilité du carbone organique sur charbon actif. Les résultats obtenus montrent que radian du bioxyde de chlore sur racide humique Pinail à l'obscurité, conduit à des faibles abattements du carbone organique dissous (< 10 %) et de l'absorbance UV à 254 nm (de l'ordre de 30 %) et conduit à des productions potentiel es en composées organohalogénés très nettement inférieures à celles formées par chloration. De plus, une préoxydation chimique au bioxyde de chlore {{permet de}} diminuer d'une manière très significative la production de composés organohalogénés au cours d'une post-chloration et semble améliorer l'adsorbabllité du carbone organique sur charbon actif. L'oxydation de l'acide humique par le bioxyde de chlore s'accompagne, par ailleurs, de la formation de chlorites (0, 65 mg/mg de CIO 2 consommé) qui peuvent ensuite être oxydés en chlorates au cours d'une post-chloration ou réduits en chlorures par un traitement au charbon actif. Enfin, les résultats obtenus font apparaître que le mécanisme d'oxydation de composés organiques parle bioxyde de chlore en présence de la lumière ainsi que les interactions entre le bioxyde de chore, les chlorites, la matière organique et le charbon actif méritent d'être plus précisément étudiés. Chlorine dioxide has drawn much recent attention {{as an alternative}} disinfectant and oxidant for drinking water to replace chlorine because of its powerful disinfecting ability and its limited capacity to produce organohalogenated compounds. However, the use of chlorine dioxide leads to chlorite (ClO 2 -) and chlorate (ClO 3 -) as inorganic oxidation by-products which are reported to have toxic effects on humans. The reactions of ClO 2 with simple organic compounds (phenols, aliphatic and aromatic amines [...] .) produce polar compounds such as quinone, ketones, aldehydes and carboxylic acids while oxydation by-products of dissolved organic matter of surface waters (in particular humic substances) are largely unknown. Consequently, {{the aim of this}} work was to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} effects of the use of chlorine dioxide in drinking water treatment To this end, experiments were carried out with dilute aqueous solutions of an isolated aquatic humic acid (Pinail humic acid, PHA) and the objectives of this present study were :- To evaluate the ClO 2 demand and to determine the productions of chlorite, chlorate and of organohalogenated compounds such as trihalomethanes (THMs), dichloroacetic and trichloroacetic acids (DCA, TCA) which are the main organohalogenated products formed by chlorination. - To show the effects of chlorine dioxide preoxidation on organic halide formation potentials (<b>postchlorination)</b> and on the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by activated carbon. In addition, reactions of chlorite with chlorine or with activated carbon were also examined. EXPERIMENTALPniail humic acid was dissolved in phosphate buffered ultra-pure water (pH = 7. 5). Oxidation and adsorption experiments were carried out in headspace-free bottles, at 20 ± 1 °C and in the dark. Stock solutions of chlorine dioxide (4 - 6 g l- 1) and of chlorine (6 - 10 g l- 1) were prepared in the laboratory and titrated by iodometry. Residual chlorine dioxide concentration in PHA solutions was determined by spectrophotometric measurement at 360 nm and by two colorimetric methods : the chlorophenol red and the ACVK methods. Concentrations of DOC and of total organic chlorine or halogen (TOCI, TOX) were measured using a DOHRMANN DC 80 carbon analyser and a DOHRMANN DX 20 A TOX analyser equipped with a microcoulometric cell, respectively. THMs, DCA and TCA were determined by a gas chromatograph equipped with a 63 Ni electron capture detector after extraction by pentane for the THMs, and methylation in ether phase for DCA and TCA. Inorganic chlorine species were analysed by HPLC with a UV detector (ClO 2 -) or by chromatography (Cl-, ClO 3 -). RESULTS• Oxidation of PHA by ClO 2 The results showed that PHA consumed about 2 mg of ClO 2 /mg of DOC after a reaction time of 24 hours (fig. 1) and that there is a rapid consumption of ClO 2 during the first 30 minutes of the reaction (fig. 2) Oxidation by ClO 2 had no effect on DOC concentration (DOC removal : < 10 %) and led to a significant decrease (about 30 %) of the UV-absorbance at 254 or 270 nm (fig. 1 and 2), and to productions of ClO 2 - (0, 65 mg of ClO 2 -/mg of ClO 2 consumed) which were independant of the applied oxidant dose and of the reaction time. Furthermore, after a 72 hour reaction time in the dark, chlorine dioxide ([ClO 2] 0 = 5 mg l- 1, [PHA] 0 = 5 mg l- 1, DOC = 2, 6 mg l- 1) produces very small amounts of chloroform (< 5 µg l- 1), DCA (5 µg l- 1) and TCA (5 µg l- 1) and organochlorinated compounds (TOCl : 36 µg/mg DOC) compared to chlorine oxidation (tableau 1). However, in the presence of sunlight, ClO 2 is rapidly photodecomposed (fig. 3) and the photodegradation products of ClO 2 allow bromide oxidation (fig. 11) and lead to higher productions of organohalogenated compounds such as THMs (fig. 4). • Chlorine dioxide preoxidation followed by chlorinationAs shown in figure 5, chlorine dioxide preoxidation reduces the production of organohalogenated compounds and the chlorine demand during <b>postchlorination.</b> For a preoxidant dose corresponding to the ClO 2 demand of PHA, the decrease in the formation potentials of CHCl 3, DCA, TCA and TOCl was about 40 - 50 %. These results confirm the similarity of the action of chlorine dioxide and chlorine on aromatic structures which have high electron density carbons and which constitute probably the most reactive precursors of organohalogenated by-products. As far as chlorite concentration is concerned, the results showed that chlorite formed during the preoxidation step was completely oxidized to chlorate during <b>postchlorination,</b> under the experimental conditions used in this study (chlorine dose : 40 mg l- 1; contact time : 24 or 72 hours). Because of the reactions of chlorine eh chlorine and with residual chlorine dioxide, a small increase in the chlorine demand was observed when PHA solutions were heavily preoxidized (fig. 5). • Chlorine dioxide preoxidation followed by activated carbon treatmentBatch experiments were carried out with a powdered activated carbon (PAC, granulometry : < 80 µm) which was obtained by crushing a commercial granular activated carbon (CECA 40, 12 x 40 mesh). Once equilibrium was achieved (contact time : 10 days), adsorption isotherms indicated that chlorine dioxide preoxidation increases the absorbability of DOC on activated carbon (fig; 4 tableau 2). Furthermore, chlorite in oxidized PHA solutions was reduced by PAC to chloride. The capacity of CECA 40 activated carbon for ClO 2 - reduction to Cl- was about 170 mg ClO 2 -/g of PAC (fig. 7). Other experiments showed that chlorite may react with specific surface groups on PAC to produce inorganic carbon (fig. 7) and with PHA only in the presence of PAC as shown the DOC and UV-absorbance curves in figure 8 and the increase of TOX concentration in the liquid phase in figure 9. Thus the observed increase in DOC absorbability on PAC after a chlorine dioxide preoxidation may be attributed to cheminal interactions between PAC, chlorite, residual chlorine dioxide and adsorbed organic matter and requires further study...|$|E
40|$|Les étapes de désinfection de l'eau, telles que l'ozonation et la chloration, génèrent des sous-produits d'oxydation de nature variée. Ces composés sont soupçonnés d'être toxiques à plus ou moins long terme. Certains d'entre eux sont, de plus, {{facilement}} biodégradables et favorisent donc une reviviscence bactérienne dans le réseau de distribution. Enfin, à cause de leurs caractéristiques organoleptiques, ils peuvent conduire à la détérioration de la qualité sensorielle de l'eau distribuée. La recherche de plusieurs sous-produits d'oxydation dans l'eau potable a pu être effectuée grâce à de nouvelles techniques d'analyse quantitative par chromatographie en phase gazeuse: il s'agit des aldéhydes et des cétones de faible poids moléculaire, des acides haloacétiques et de certains céto-acides. Ces composés ont été recherchés dans des usines comportant une étape d'ozonation. L'influence de ce traitement sur {{la formation}} des aldéhydes et des céto-acides est démontrée dans cette étude. L'ozonation multiplie la concentration totale d'aldéhydes par un facteur variant de 2 à 4 suivant les usines et les trois céto-acides recherchés ont été trouvés en quantités importantes dans des eaux ozonées. La filtration sur charbon, lorsqu'elle existe, s'avère efficace pour l'élimination de ces composés. Les trois acides chloroacétiques sont présents dans des eaux chlorées, en sortie d'usines appliquant des taux de chloration assez importants. Enfin, I'évolution de ces sous-produits d'oxydation tout au long d'un réseau de distribution a pu être expliquée par leur biodégradabilité. New regulations are being {{considered by the}} US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) concerning a variety of disinfection by-products formed during chlorination and ozonation (halonitriles, haloketones, haloacids, low molecular weight aldehydes [...] .) and many surveys are underway to assess the presence of such products in drinking waters. This renewed interest for disinfection byproducts (DBPs) arises from their suspected carcinogenic or mutagenic properties. In addition to possible long term health effects, specific disinfection by-products may also induce immediate water quality deterioration due to their objectionable organoleptic properties. Biodegradable DBP's also probably contribute a substantial proportion of the biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC). As far as oxidation disinfection practices in France are concerned, the use of ozone is frequent. Also, most major French treatment plants include an activated carbon filtration process {{which is likely to}} remove some of the DBPs {{as well as some of}} their precursors. This paper summarizes the results obtained along various treatment plants in the Paris area, concerning three major families of DBPs considered for regulation: the DBPs investigated include 30 aldehydes and ketones, chloroacetic acids and 3 ketoacids. The aldehydes and ketones were measured by GC-ECD or GC-MS after derivatization with PFBHA; the chloroacetic acids were measured using a micro extraction method with methyltertiobutylether followed by diazomethane methylation and GC-ECD or GC-MS; the six plants investigated in the Paris area treat surface water from the river Seine upstream of Paris (Morsang, Vigneux, Orly, Ivry) or groundwater which is artificially recharged with Seine river water downstream of Paris (Le Pecq, Aubergenville). The Alençon plant which is located outside the Paris area treats raw water from the Sarthe river plus groundwater from various wells. All the treatment lines studied include an ozonation step which is followed at some plants (Morsang, Ivry, Vigneux, Le Pecq-Minor) by a granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration. The treatment line investigated at Vigneux used an ozone/hydrogen peroxide combination as an oxidation step. Three of these treatment lines (Morsang, Le Pecq-Minor, Alençon) comprise a prechlorination step; the other plants only use chlorination as a final disinfection step. The study compares the total concentration of aldehydes detected before and after ozonation as well as after GAC filtration. Approximately half of this total is usually due to formaldehyde while acetaldehyde, glyoxal and methylglyoxal represent most of the remainder. These concentrations which initially range from 1 to 25 µg/l show a drastic increase after ozonation. Depending on the water DOC and ozonation conditions, the total level of aldehydes is multiplied by a factor of 2 to 4. The final chlorine disinfection step used at all these plants does not significantly influence the total concentration of the aldehydes, therefore the level of these DBPs at the outlet of the plants is mainly determined by the ozonation or ozone/GAC filtration steps. The three aldo and ketoacids analysed were glyoxylic acid, pyruvic acid and ketomalonic acid. They were detected in ozonated water with total concentrations which range from 65 to 80 µg/l. Glyoxylic acid alone, represents half of these quantities. Chloroacetic acids were not detected at the outlet of the plants which are supplied by groundwater (Le Pecq-Minor, Aubergenville) and which apply a low chlorine dose (0. 1 - 0. 2 ppm) as a final disinfection stop. Although the Morsang treatment line investigated applies a low prechlorination dose ([smaller or equal] 1 ppm) in addition to the low <b>postchlorination</b> dose, no haloacids were detected at the outlet, which is agreement with the low levels of trihalomethanes usually detected at this plant. The absence of haloacids at the outlet of this plant can be attributed to the efficiency of the ozone/GAC combination as well as to the low prechlorination dose applied. Haloacids were only detected at the outlet of the Orly, Ivry and Alençon plants which apply a rather high chlorine dose during the final disinfection stop (between 0. 8 and 2. 2 ppm) in order to maintain a residual in the distribution system. Typical levels of haloacids are found between 10 and 35 µg/l, mainly under the form of dichloro and trichloroacetic acid. To summarize, the levels of the specific DBPs investigated remain well below their individual WHO recommendations (respectively 50, 100 and 900 µg/ 1 for dichloroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and formaldehyde). Unless more drastic national regulations are implemented, the interest in the fate of these DBP's mainly lies in their possible secondary effects such as enhancement of bacterial regrowth in distribution systems or degradation of drinking water organoleptic properties...|$|E
