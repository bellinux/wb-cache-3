40|$|<b>Porcine</b> <b>enterovirus</b> type 2 or porcine {{adenovirus}} type 3 were seeded into {{samples of}} pig slurry, and a bovine enterovirus was seeded into cattle slurry, and {{samples of the}} slurry were aerated in the laboratory for 21 days. The viruses were inactivated more rapidly in the aerated slurry than in control slurry which was not aerated. The difference in inactivation rate was greatest for the porcine adenovirus and least for the bovine enterovirus. Inactivation of the <b>porcine</b> <b>enterovirus</b> in aerated distilled water and in aerated, autoclaved pig slurry proceeded at a similar rate as in the same materials which were not aerated. Ten samples of aerated slurry were collected from an aeration tank which received weekly additions of raw pig slurry which was sampled at the same times. Each sample yielded a <b>porcine</b> <b>enterovirus</b> after concentration with the polyelectrolyte PE- 60, but in three comparative titrations the viral infectivity titre in concentrates of the raw slurry was at least 1000 times greater than in the aerated slurry. <b>Porcine</b> <b>enterovirus</b> type 2 and porcine adenovirus type 3, which were seeded into pig slurry, and a bovine enterovirus seeded into cattle slurry, were inactivated by treatment of the slurry with calcium hydroxide at pH 11. 5.

Three days after infection, {{five of the}} piglets were treated with cyclophosphamide, together with two of four uninfected control piglets. The treated, infected piglets developed severe diarrhea, and one showed signs of encephalomyelitis. These piglets showed no virological evidence of recovery from the infection, since the virus persisted throughout the intestinal tract, and they failed to mount a serological response.

40|$|A serosurvey for viruses {{associated}} with reproductive disorders {{was conducted in}} 25 conventional Belgian farms. Serum antibody titers for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2), porcine parvovirus (PPV), <b>porcine</b> <b>enteroviruses</b> (PEV) and swine influenza viruses (SIV) were determined in gilts and sows. All the animals were seropositive for PCV 2 and > 95 % were seropositive for all 4 embryopathogenic PEV serotypes. Consequently, special preventive measures appear to be unnecessary for these viruses. In I farm, non-vaccinated gilts were found to run a risk of developing PPV-induced reproductive disorders. Vaccination against PPV could exclude this risk. In 10 farms, gilts seronegative for one or more specific SIV subtypes were introduced into a herd {{that had previously been}} infected with the same subtypes. Vaccination of gilts against SIV may prevent reproductive disorders in gilts and respiratory problems in their offspring. In I farm, newly purchased gilts that were possibly shedding PRRSV were introduced into a PRRSV seronegative sow herd.

The invasiveness of Campylobacter jejuni ATCC 33560 was significantly increased for HEp- 2 cells preinfected with echovirus 7, coxsackievirus B 3, and UV-inactivated (noninfectious) coxsackievirus B 3 particles. Additionally, the invasiveness of C. jejuni M 96, a clinical isolate, was significantly increased for HEp- 2 cells preinfected with coxsackievirus B 3. Poliovirus and <b>porcine</b> <b>enterovirus</b> had no effect on C. jejuni ATCC 33560 adherence and invasiveness. Furthermore, poliovirus had no effect on the ability of C. jejuni M 96 to adhere to and invade HEp- 2 cells. Campylobacter hyointestinalis and Campylobacter mucosalis, two noninvasive isolates, did not invade virus-infected HEp- 2 cells. The increase in the invasiveness of C. jejuni appeared {{to be the result of}} specific interactions between the virus and the HEp- 2 cell membrane. The data suggest that the invasiveness of Campylobacter spp. is dependent upon the inherent properties of the organism.

40|$|Seventy-two {{strains of}} <b>porcine</b> <b>enteroviruses</b> {{including}} strains from North America, England, and Japan were compared by cell culture neutralization tests {{to provide a}} serological classification of North American strains. From the tests, eight serogroups evolved, with serogroup 8 having a possible three subgroups. There appeared to be some intergroup relationship among certain viruses in groups having the same specific cytopathic effect (CPE) in cell culture. There was no apparent cross-reaction between the group with type II CPE and groups with type I CPE. Antisera produced in nonhost chickens provided a satisfactory antibody source for the tests. It was proposed that satisfactory typing of viruses could be done best by cross-neutralization rather than by one-way neutralization tests. This provided the homologous serum titer as determined in the laboratory conducting the tests which was important where comparisons are {{made on the basis}} of per cent of the homologous titer. It was further emphasized that viruses of tissue origin and their antisera have fewer intergroup reactions than viruses of intestinal origin and their antisera.

Multiple doses of adjuvanted, PE 60 -concentrated, ethylenimine-inactivated T 80 virus given by both the oral and subcutaneous routes induced the appearance of significant levels of virus neutralizing activity in the gastrointestinal tract of piglets vaccinated at four weeks of age. This activity, found predominantly in large intestine, was present 14 days after administration of the first dose of vaccine and significant levels of activity were still detectable six weeks later.

40|$|Nucleotide {{sequencing}} and phylogenetic {{analysis of}} 10 recognized prototype {{strains of the}} <b>porcine</b> <b>enterovirus</b> (PEV) cytopathic effect (CPE) group I reveals a close relationship of the viral genomes to the previously sequenced strain F 65, supporting {{the concept of a}} reclassification of this virus group into a new picornavirus genus. Also, nucleotide sequences of the polyprotein-encoding genome region or the P 1 region of 28 historic strains and recent field isolates were determined. The data suggest that several closely related but antigenically and molecular distinct serotypes constitute one species within the proposed genus Teschovirus. Based on sequence data and serological data, we propose a new serotype with strain Dresden as prototype. This hitherto unrecognized serotype is closely related to porcine teschovirus 1 (PTV- 1, former PEV- 1), but induces type-specific neutralizing antibodies.

40|$|The virus {{neutralizing}} {{substance in}} the gastrointestinal tract of swine vaccinated {{in different ways}} with <b>porcine</b> <b>enterovirus</b> strain T 80 was characterized by tests for enhancement and absorption of virus neutralizing activity by class specific antiporcine Ig antisera.

The serum virus neutralizing activity of this group was present in all three classes but primarily in the IgG class. The IgA in the serum of this group was presumably of gut origin. However, in piglets vaccinated with live virus intramuscularly, with formaldehyde-inactivated virus orally or intramuscularly or with ethylenimine-inactivated virus by both oral and subcutaneous routes, both serum and gastrointestinal virus neutralizing activity were attributable predominantly to antibodies of the IgG and IgM classes.

40|$|A HEp- 2 {{cell culture}} model {{was used to}} {{investigate}} the invasive properties of Campylobacter species. Two of twenty-five Campylobacter isolates did not invade HEp- 2 cells, and one of these isolates did not adhere to the epithelial cells. Penetration of HEp- 2 epithelial cells by C. jejuni was significantly (P < 0. 05) inhibited with C. jejuni lysates and a MAb (1 B 4) in competitive inhibition studies. Immunogold electron microscopic studies revealed that the 1 B 4 MAb bound to the flagella and cell surface of low passage (invasive) C. jejuni M 96, whereas only the flagella of high passage (non-invasive) C. jejuni were labelled. Western blot analysis revealed that the 1 B 4 MAb identified an epitope on antigens {{ranging in size from}} 66 to 44 kDa in invasive and non-invasive organisms. Antigens were also recognized in lysates prepared only from invasive strains from 42 to 38 kDa. Sodium meta-periodate chemical treatment of C. jejuni lysates significantly (P < 0. 05) affected its inhibitory capacity. Additionally, proteinase K and sodium meta-periodate treatment of lysates changed the mobility of antigens recognized by the 1 B 4 MAb. This suggests that the antigens required for epithelial cell penetration by C. jejuni may be glycoprotein in nature and that the functional binding site is dependent upon an intact carbohydrate moiety. Co-infection of HEp- 2 epithelial cells with coxsackievirus B 3, echovirus 7, polio virus (LSc type 1), <b>porcine</b> <b>enterovirus</b> and Campylobacter isolates was performed to determine if a synergistic effect could be obtained. The invasiveness of C. jejuni was significantly increased for HEp- 2 cells pre-infected with echovirus 7, coxsackievirus B 3, and UV-inactivated (non-infectious) coxsackievirus B 3 particles. Polio and <b>porcine</b> <b>enterovirus</b> had no effect on C. jejuni adherence and invasiveness. C. hyointestinalis and C. mucosalis, two non-invasive isolates, did not invade virus-infected HEp- 2 cells.

Moreover, the predicted cleavage sites for the insertion suggest that this gene was being expressed as a single protein, rather than a fused protein. Recombination in enteroviruses has been reported as a major mechanism to generate genetic diversity, but gene insertions across viral families are rather uncommon.

All 14 sampled farms were positive for PEV- 9 and the overall prevalence of infection in the studied pigs was 8. 3 % (37 / 447).

The mechanism of translation initiation on hepacivirus/pestivirus (HP) IRESs, which involves factor-independent binding to ribosomal 40 S subunits, also differs fundamentally from initiation on these picornavirus IRESs. Ribosomal binding to HP IRESs requires conserved sequences that form a pseudoknot and the adjacent IIId and IIIe domains; analogous elements do not occur in the two principal groups of picornavirus IRESs.

40|$|Abstract Despite {{the vast}} {{distribution}} and expansive diversity of enteroviruses reported globally, indicators defining a complete {{view of the}} epidemiology of entero-viruses in tropical countries such as the Philippines are yet to be established. Detection of enteroviruses in the envi-ronment {{has been one of}} the markers of circulating viruses in a community. This study aimed to bridge the gap in the epidemiology of enteroviruses in the Philippines by pro-viding an overview of the occurrence of enteroviruses in both urban and rural rivers. Molecular detection directed at the VP 1 region of the enterovirus genome was performed on 44 grab river water samples collected from April to December 2009. The majority of the enterovirus serotypes detected were clustered with human enterovirus C species (HEV-C; 21 / 42), followed by HEV-B (12 / 42) and HEV-A (9 / 42). <b>Porcine</b> <b>enterovirus</b> 9 was also found in 12 out of 44 water samples. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the viruses detected were closely related, if not all forming a monophyletic clade, with those enteroviruses detected previously from acute flaccid paralysis cases in the country. The clustering of environmental and human enterovirus strains implies that the circulation of these strains were associated with river contamination. This study gives fur-ther evidence of the environmental persistence of entero-viruses once they are shed in feces and likewise, provides additional data which may help in understanding the epi-demiology of enteroviruses in humans, highlighting the need for more studies on the potential public health risks linked with enteroviruses found in the environment and their eventual clinical consequences in the country...|$|E

To further characterize this group of viruses and to clarify their classification within the Picornaviridae, we have determined the complete genomic sequence of SV 2 (8126 nucleotides). The genome was typical of members of Picornaviridae, encoding a single open reading frame. The putative polyprotein contained typical picornavirus protease cleavage sites, yielding mature proteins homologous to each of the known picornavirus proteins. SV 2 contained an amino-terminal extension of the reading frame, which was analogous to the leader protein of members of the Aphthovirus, Cardiovirus, Erbovirus, Kobuvirus, and Teschovirus genera, but there was no significant amino acid homology with any of these known leader proteins. The 2 A protein also aligned poorly with the 2 A proteins of other picornaviruses. The deduced amino acid sequences of the SV 2 structural and nonstructural proteins were related to but phylogenetically distinct from those of enteroviruses and human rhinoviruses. The major distinguishing features of SV 2 were the presence of a type 2 internal ribosome entry site in the 5 ′-NTR, a putative leader protein encoded upstream of the structural proteins, and an unusually large 2 A protein. On the basis of the molecular analysis, we propose that SV 2, SV 16, SV 18, SV 42, SV 44, SV 45, SV 49, and <b>porcine</b> <b>enterovirus</b> 8 be classified as members of a new genus in Picornaviridae and that SV 2 (strain 2383) be designated as the type strain...|$|E

The time for inactivation of 7 log 10 units of porcine parvovirus (PPV) was about 24 h for both El concentrations, whereas 5 log 10 units of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) was inactivated in 2 h for both El concentrations and 6 log 10 units of <b>porcine</b> <b>enterovirus</b> (PEV) was inactivated within 3 h. The inactivation with electron-beam irradiation resulted in almost linear curves in a semilogarithmic plot of virus titer versus irradiation dose, reflecting a first-order inactivation. The rate of inactivation was almost twice as fast in the liquid samples compared to the rate in frozen ones, giving values of the doses needed to reduce virus infectivity 1 log 10 unit for inactivation of PPV of 11. 8 and 7. 7 kGy for frozen and liquid samples, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for BVDV were 4. 9 and 2. 5 kGy, respectively, and those for PEV were 6. 4 and 4. 4 kGy, respectively. The nonlinear inactivation with El {{makes it impossible to}} extrapolate the curves beyond the virus detection limit and thereby predict the necessary time for complete inactivation, i. e., to a level beyond the detection limit, of virus in a given sample. The first-order inactivation obtained with electron-beam irradiation makes such a prediction possible and justifiable. The two methods are discussed with respect to their different kinetics and applicability under different circumstances and criteria for inactivation, and considerations for choice of method are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change will}} lead to more extreme rain events in parts of Sweden {{resulting}} in sewage overflows and thus more contamination of surface water, leading to an increased risk of waterborne infections. Swedish and Norwegian surface waters are rich in humic substances with high organic carbon content that interferes with disinfection, the most important barrier to viruses in the water treatment plant. Therefore the disinfection potential of free chlorine was evaluated for a number of viruses: canine adenovirus (CAdV), murine norovirus (MNV), mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) and <b>porcine</b> <b>enterovirus</b> (PEV), and model viruses (MS 2, 28 B, ФX 174 and Ф 6 bacteriophages) on different water qualities (pH, turbidity and organic carbon content). Viruses were enumerated by end-point titration and bacteriophages with plaque assay. The inactivation studies were done by chlorination (The amount of sodium hypochlorite added was 30 – 60 ml/L based on the types of water) at 5 °C and the chlorine values were in between 0. 12 – 0. 2 mg/l range. Virus inactivations were determined for the initial reduction (IR) when the chlorine is consumed and further during the contact time within the test tube. During the later part, the chlorine contact time (CT) for one log reduction was determined (CT- 1). The initial reduction was in between 3. 18 – 3. 94 logs for viruses (Adenovirus > Orthoreovirus > Norovirus > Enterovirus) and for bacteriophages it was in between 0. 34 – 4. 89 (ΦX 174 > Φ 6 > 28 B > MS 2). Due to high initial reduction the number of results used for determination of CT for one log reduction were limited. The CT- 1 were around 0. 5 mg*min/L for all the viruses. For a certain CT- 1 time was more important than the chlorine concentration for MNV, PEV and MRV. The CT- 1 for the bacteriophages MS 2, 28 B and фX 174 were 12. 6, 3. 44 and 0. 79 mg*min/L respectively. The CT values for ф 6 bacteriophage could not be calculated because of its fast inactivation. MS 2 and 28 B bacteriophages were persistent to free chlorine and can preferably be used in larger scale pilot studies to better determine the effect of water quality parameters. The ΦX 174 had a similar CT- 1 as viruses, however the high initial reduction requires that it is added after the initial consumption {{to be used as a}} model organism. The fact that time seems to be more important than chlorine concentration for virus inactivation indicates that the design of contact reactors are important to provide as long minimum contact time for the water to react with free chlorine...|$|E
