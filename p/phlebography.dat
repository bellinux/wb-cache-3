40|$|Background and Objectives: Thromboembolic risk in {{orthopedic}} oncology is high due {{to several}} factors. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess clinically significant thromboembolic disease in 986 patients operated on with a prosthetic reconstruction of the lower limbs after the resection of bone tumors and prophylactically treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). Methods: Between 1983 and 2006, 986 patients had uncemented megaprostheses after a resection of the lower limbs for bone tumors. Antithromboembolic prophylaxis was always administered with LMWH from the immediate postoperative time until the time of complete weightbearing. <b>Phlebographies</b> and vascular ecodoppler were not performed postoperatively on a regular basis. Patients were followed in the clinic with imaging studies for several years (lower limb CT, MRI, CT of the chest for malignant tumors).

40|$|A extensão cranial da veia safena parva se destaca pelas inúmeras variações anatômicas e diferentes padrões de fluxo que podem ser observados, descritos em trabalhos envolvendo dissecções pós-morte ou cirúrgicas, flebografias e Doppler, que denotam a formação embriológica mais precoce e complexa em relação à safena magna. A observação de um tipo específico de extensão cranial da safena parva onde o sentido das valvas é contrário ao habitualmente observado foi primeiramente caracterizada por Carlo Giacomini, sendo o fluxo caudal nesses casos de aspecto normal sem sinal de incompetência valvar. Este artigo demonstra os padrões anatômicos e de fluxo que podem ser caracterizados na veia safena parva, contribuindo para que aspectos normais do seu fluxo não sejam confundidos com incompetência valvar. Cranial {{extension}} of the small saphenous vein is of special interest due {{to the number of}} anatomical variations and different blood flow patterns observed, which have been described in investigations including postmortem or surgical dissections, <b>phlebographies,</b> and Doppler studies, indicating an earlier and more complex embryological development in relation to the great saphenous vein.

40|$|MR <b>phlebography</b> was {{recently}} proposed {{as a possible}} alternative to contrast venography in the detection of deep venous thrombosis. We focused our work {{on the study of}} the pelvic veins since it is at this level that contrast venography and the other noninvasive techniques, i. e., <b>phlebography,</b> impedance plethysmography and US, exhibit their major limitations. Thirty patients underwent MR phlebography: 13 of them had a diagnosis of DVT of the pelvic venous district and the other 17 had negative results for this condition. All the patients were also examined with color-Doppler US at the pelvis and legs. In all the patients submitted to MR <b>phlebography,</b> thrombosis site and presence were demonstrated, with diagnostic information also on its extent and adhesion to vein wall. To conclude, MR <b>phlebography</b> can provide contrast venography-like images in a noninvasive way, with high accuracy (100 % sensitivity and 90 % specificity) especially in the pelvic district where the limitations of other techniques are more apparent. Larger series of patients must be studied to assess the actual role of MR <b>phlebography</b> in the patients with DVT or at high risk for this condition...|$|E

Results 220 pts, 136 men (60 ± 15 years) were studied. In 140 of 220 pts neuroimaging showed evidence of manifest stroke. TEE identified a potential cardiac source of embolism (left atrial thrombus [LAT], PFO, atrial septal aneurysm [ASA], spontaneous contrast [SC] endocarditic valve lesions, mitral valvular disease [MVD] and prosthetic head valves) in 43 % of pts compared with only 18 % by TTE (p< 0. 01). TEE was especially superior compared to TTE for identifying LAT (10 versus 0 pts), SC (26 vs 6 pts), PFO associated with ASA (16 vs 6 pts) and PFO alone (34 vs 20 pts). <b>Phlebography</b> was performed in 50 pts with PFO. Of those pts 32 showed brain infarct ≥ 1 cm diameter on neuroimaging, 18 pts had TIA. <b>Phlebography</b> revealed clinically silent DVT only in pts with brain infarct (4 cases, 12. 5 %), no pt with TIA had positive <b>phlebography.</b> ConclusionIn this prospective study TEE detected significantly more potential sources of embolism than TTE; moreover, <b>phlebography</b> in the presence of PFO and a clear-cut ischemic brain lesion on neuroimaging revealed a 12. 5 % incidence of clinically unsuspected deep venous thrombosis. These findings strongly suggest paradoxical embolism as an important mechanism of stroke and support <b>phlebography</b> to define the relevance of PFO in the stepwise work-up of pts with suspected cardiogenic stroke...|$|E

40|$|Objective:To {{evaluate}} {{the technique of}} ultrasound colour Doppler in diagnosing venous valvular incompetence in the lower leg. Design:Prospective clinical study. Setting:Department of clinical physiology. Materials: 44 patients (56 legs) referred with a clinical diagnosis of deep venous insufficiency. Chief outcome measures:Colour Doppler and descending <b>phlebography.</b> Main results:Using <b>phlebography</b> as a “gold standard” {{the accuracy of the}} colour Doppler technique varied between 93 % and 55 % for the different veins. For the superficial and deep femoral veins, the popliteal vein and the long and short saphenous veins the accuracy was between 90 % and 70 %. The lowest correlation was found for the deep calf veins (55 – 66 % accuracy). Conclusions:Colour Doppler was found to be a suitable technique for non-invasive investigation of patients with suspected venous insufficiency. Since the colour Doppler technique is non-invasive it is well suited for follow-up studies.

40|$|Introduction: Pelvic varicose veins, one of {{the main}} causes of chronic pelvic pain and dyspareunia, are an {{important}} source of reflux for lower limb varicose veins, especially in recurrent cases. Color Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs and transvaginal ultrasound are the noninvasive diagnostic methods most commonly used to assess pelvic venous insufficiency, whereas <b>phlebography</b> is still considered as the gold standard. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of lower limb varicose veins originating from the pelvis in a group of female patients and to determine the agreement between results obtained via color Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs, transvaginal ultrasound, and <b>phlebography.</b> Methods: The sample comprised female patients referred to a vascular laboratory for lower limb screening. Patients diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis were excluded. Data analysis included kappa coefficient of agreement, McNemar's test, sensitivity and specificity values. Results: Of a total of 1, 020 patients, 124 (12. 2 %) had findings compatible with reflux of pelvic origin. Among these patients, 51 (41. 2 %) were recurrent cases. A total of 249 were submitted to transvaginal ultrasound. There was significant agreement between lower limb ultrasonographic findings and transvaginal findings. <b>Phlebography</b> was performed in 54 patients. The comparison between transvaginal ultrasound and <b>phlebography</b> was associated with a 96. 2 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity. Conclusions: The authors draw attention to the relatively high prevalence of lower limb varicose veins originating from the pelvis, suggesting an important but underdiagnosed cause of recurrent varicose veins...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of 32 patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis was carried out using blood-pool radionuclide scanning and conventional x-ray <b>phlebography.</b> Results of the two methods showed close agreement, the sensitivity (positive correlation) of the scan being 100 % and its specificity 89 %. We conclude that a patient's red cells labelled with 99 mtechnetium (99 mTc) provide an excellent medium {{for this type of}} scanning. The technique has particular advantages in visualising the whole venous system, giving a persisting image, and obviating the need to inject into a vein of the affected limb. In view of the inherent disadvantages of contrast <b>phlebography,</b> 99 mTc-red-cell scanning is clearly an acceptable alternative...|$|E

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was detected using systematic bilateral <b>phlebography</b> between the eighth and 12 th postoperative day in 47 (39. 8 %) patients. D-dimer plasma concentrations did not differ between patients who had DVT and those who had no DVT, either pre-operatively (n = 118, P = 0. 63) or at the time of <b>phlebography</b> (n = 111, P = 0. 70).
