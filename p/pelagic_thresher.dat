50|$|The <b>pelagic</b> <b>{{thresher}}</b> (Alopias pelagicus) is {{a species}} of thresher shark, family Alopiidae; this group of sharks {{is characterized by the}} greatly elongated upper lobes of their caudal fins. The <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> occurs in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, usually far from shore but occasionally entering coastal habitats. It is often confused with the common thresher (A. vulpinus), even in professional publications, but can be distinguished by the dark, rather than white, color over the bases of its pectoral fins. The smallest of the three thresher species, the <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> typically measures 3 m (10 ft) long.|$|E
5000|$|Sharks: There are {{at least}} 22 shark species including: Blue shark, Silky shark, Bigeye {{thresher}} shark, <b>Pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> shark, Oceanic whitetip shark, and Tawny nurse shark.|$|E
50|$|Anatomical {{examination}} {{indicates that}} the <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> {{is unlikely to be}} warm-bodied like the common thresher. The <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> lacks a rete mirabile, a blood vessel countercurrent exchange system that prevents metabolic heat from being dissipated into the water, inside its trunk. Furthermore, its aerobic red muscles, responsible for generating heat in the common thresher, are positioned in two lateral strips just beneath the skin rather than {{at the core of the}} body. A rete system is present around the pelagic thresher's brain and eyes, albeit less developed than in the bigeye thresher, which may serve to buffer those organs against temperature changes.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{confusion}} {{with the common}} thresher, {{the distribution of the}} <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> may be wider than is currently known. It ranges extensively in the Indo-Pacific, with scattered records from South Africa, the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea (off Somalia, between Oman and India, and off Pakistan), to China, southeastern Japan, northwestern Australia, New Caledonia, and Tahiti, to the Hawaiian Islands, the Gulf of California, and the Galapagos Islands. The North Pacific population shifts northward during warm El Nino years. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA has shown extensive gene flow within the eastern and western Pacific <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> populations, but little flow between them.|$|E
50|$|The diet of the <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> {{consists}} {{mainly of}} small midwater fishes, which are stunned with whip-like strikes of their tails. Along {{with all other}} mackerel sharks, the <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> exhibits ovoviviparity and usually gives birth to litters of two. The developing embryos are oophagous, feeding on unfertilized eggs produced by the mother. The young are born unusually large, up to 43% {{the length of the}} mother. Pelagic threshers are valued by commercial fisheries for their meat, skin, liver oil, and fins, and are also pursued by sport fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessed this species as Vulnerable in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} feeding ecology of the <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher.</b> Its very slender tail and fine dentition suggest an exclusive diet of small, pelagic prey. Analysis of stomach contents reveal that pelagic threshers feed mainly on barracudinas, lightfishes, and escolars, all inhabitants of the mesopelagic zone. Therefore, little competition occurs between the <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> and other large oceanic piscivores such as billfishes, tunas, and dolphinfishes, which tend to feed near the surface. As in other threshers, pelagic threshers may swim in circles to drive schooling prey into a compact mass, before striking them sharply with the upper lobe of their tails to stun them. Because of this behavior, pelagic threshers are often hooked on longlines by their tails.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> {{has never}} been implicated in an attack on humans; it has small jaws and teeth for its size and tends to flee from divers. This shark is taken by {{commercial}} fisheries in the central Pacific and western Indian Oceans, as well as off California and Mexico. Abundant off northeastern Taiwan, it comprises over 12% (about 3,100 fish, 220 metric tons) of the annual Taiwanese shark landings. The meat is sold for human consumption, the skin is made into leather, and the fins are used for shark fin soup in Asia. The squalene oil in the liver of the <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> can comprise 10% of its weight, and {{is used in the}} manufacture of cosmetics, health foods, and high-grade machine oil.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> is an active, strong swimmer and {{has been}} known to leap clear of the water (five times in a row on one {{documented}} occasion). Predators of the <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> include larger fishes (including other sharks) and toothed whales. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Litobothrium amplifica, L. daileyi, and L. nickoli, which inhabit the shark's spiral valve intestine, and copepods of the genus Echthrogaleus, which infest the skin. At Malapascua Island in the Philippines, pelagic threshers have been observed regularly visiting cleaning stations occupied by cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus and Thalassoma lunare), during which they exhibit characteristic behaviors to facilitate the cleaning interaction. These visits occur more frequently early in the morning, and may be why these normally oceanic sharks are sometimes encountered in shallow water.|$|E
5000|$|An {{allozyme}} analysis {{conducted by}} Blaise Eitner in 1995 {{showed that the}} closest relative of the <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> is the bigeye thresher (A. superciliosus), with which it forms a clade.

However, {{the existence of this}} fourth species has yet to be confirmed by other sources.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> {{primarily}} inhabits {{the open}} ocean, occurring {{from the surface}} {{to a depth of}} at least 150 m (492 ft). However, it occasionally comes close to shore in regions with a narrow continental shelf, and has been observed near coral reef dropoffs or seamounts in the Red Sea and the Gulf of California, and off Indonesia and Micronesia. It has also been known to enter large lagoons in the Tuamotu Islands.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> was {{originally}} described by Japanese ichthyologist Hiroshi Nakamura {{on the basis}} of three large specimens, none of which was designated a type specimen. He illustrated one of the three specimens in his paper, [...] "On the two species of the thresher shark from Formosan waters", published in August 1935. Nakamura also separately illustrated and described a fetus, that Leonard Compagno later concluded was probably of a common thresher. Several authors, including Gohar and Mazhar (1964, Red Sea), Kato, Springer and Wagner (1967, Eastern Pacific), Fourmanoir and Laboute (1976, New Caledonia), Johnson (1978, Tahiti), and Faughnan (1980, Hawaiian Islands) have published illustrations of [...] "common threshers" [...] that were in fact pelagic threshers.|$|E
50|$|Named {{for their}} {{exceptionally}} long, thresher-like heterocercal tail or caudal fins (which {{can be as}} long as the total body length), thresher sharks are active predators; the tail is used as a weapon to stun prey. The thresher shark has a short head and a cone-shaped nose. The mouth is generally small, and the teeth range in size from small to large. By far the largest of the three species is the common thresher, Alopias vulpinus, which may reach a length of 6.1 m and a weight of over 500 kg. The bigeye thresher, Alopias superciliosus, is next in size, reaching a length of 4.9 m (16 ft); at just 3 m (10 ft), the <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher,</b> Alopias pelagicus, is the smallest.|$|E

The common thresher is the largest thresher shark species, commonly reaching 5 m long and 230 kg in weight. The confirmed length record for this shark is 5.7 m, while the maximum possible length may be 6.1 - 6.5 m. The heaviest individual on record is a 4.8 m female that weighed 510 kg.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> is the {{smallest}} of the thresher sharks, averaging 3 m (10 ft) in length and 69.5 kg (153.3 lb) in weight, and usually not exceeding 3.3 m (10.8 ft) and 88.4 kg (194.9 lb). Males and females attain known maximum lengths of 3.5 m (11.5 ft) and 3.8 m (12.5 ft), respectively. A record of 5 m (16.4 ft) is dubious and may have resulted from confusion with other thresher species. This species has a fusiform body (wide in the middle and tapered at the ends) and a very slender upper caudal fin lobe nearly as long {{as the rest of the}} shark. The pectoral fins are long and straight with broad, rounded tips. The first dorsal fin is placed halfway between the pectoral and pelvic fins, and is of comparable size to the pelvic fins. The second dorsal and anal fins are tiny.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{occasionally}} sighted in shallow, inshore waters, {{thresher sharks}} are primarily pelagic; they prefer the open ocean, venturing no deeper than 500 m. Common threshers {{tend to be}} more common in coastal waters over continental shelves. Common thresher sharks are found along the continental shelves of North America and Asia of the North Pacific, but are rare in the Central and Western Pacific. In the warmer waters of the Central and Western Pacific, bigeye and <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> sharks are more common. A thresher shark was seen on the live video feed from one of the ROVs monitoring BP's Macondo oil well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico.

50|$|Based on {{analyses}} of observer {{data collected from}} 2005 to 2009, 22 shark species were observed captured in the Marshall Islands longline tuna fishery, with 80% of the shark catch representing five species: blue shark (Prionace glauca), silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), bigeye thresher shark (Alopias superciliosus), <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> shark (A. pelagicus) and oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) (Bromhead et al., 2012). Based on 2009 observer data, sharks and rays compose about 18% of total catch by weight by the Marshall Islands longline fishery. Elasmobranch species composition is 30% blue shark, 13% silky shark, 10% mako shark, 9% oceanic whitetip shark, and 37% other combined sharks and rays. Bromhead et al. (2012) found that in 2009, {{the most recent year}} of available observer data, the fishery had discontinued the use of fishing gear and methods known to be employed to target sharks (using large pieces of fish meat as bait, and placing baited hooks near the surface by attaching branchlines to floats), which had been employed in previous years of the study period (2005-2008). In 2011 the Marshall Islands adopted a law that prohibits targeting sharks and prohibits the retention of sharks (see shark sanctuary).|$|E
50|$|Like {{the rest}} of the {{mackerel}} sharks, the <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> is ovoviviparous. It gives birth to two pups at a time (rarely just one), one per uterus. With no defined breeding season, most adult females are pregnant throughout the year; the gestation period is uncertain, but has been suggested to be less than one year as in the common thresher. The developing embryos are sustained by a yolk sac until they are 12 cm (4.7 in) long, after which they are oophagous and feed on egg capsules produced by the mother. Each capsule measures about 55 mm (2.2 in) long and 12 mm (0.5 in) across, and contains 20 - 30 ova. Early stage embryos have specialized teeth for opening the capsules, while later-stage embryos have their teeth hidden and swallow the capsules whole, their teeth not becoming functional again until just after birth. No evidence of sibling cannibalism has been found as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus). Young pelagic threshers are born unusually large, up to 1.6 m (5.2 ft) long or 43% the length of the mother, which likely reduces predation on the newborns.|$|E

40|$|The hunting {{strategies}} of <b>pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> sharks (Alopias pelagicus) were investigated at Pescador Island in the Philippines. It {{has long been}} suspected that thresher sharks hunt with their scythe-like tails but the kinematics associated with the behaviour in the wild are poorly understood. From 61 observations recorded by handheld underwater video camera between June and October 2010, 25 thresher shark shunting events were analysed. Thresher sharks employed tail-slaps to debilitate sardines at all times of day. Hunting events comprised preparation, strike, wind-down recovery and prey item collection phases, which occurred sequentially. Preparation phases were significantly longer than the others, presumably to enable a shark to windup a tail-slap. Tail-slaps were initiated by an adduction of the pectoral fins, a manoeuvre that changed a thresher shark’s pitch promoting its posterior region to lift rapidly, and stall its approach. Tail-slaps occurred {{with such force that}} they may have caused dissolved gas to diffuse out of the water column forming bubbles. Thresher sharks were able to consume more than one sardine at a time, suggesting that tail-slapping is an effective foraging strategy for hunting schooling prey. <b>Pelagic</b> <b>thresher</b> sharks appear to pursue sardines opportunistically by day and night, which may make them vulnerable to fisheries. Alopiids possess specialist pectoral and caudal fins that are likely to have evolved, at least in part, for tail-slapping.

Cleaners did not preferentially inspect thresher sharks by time of day or by shark sex, but there was a direct correlation between the amount of time a thresher shark spent at a cleaning station and the number of inspections it received. Thresher shark clients modified their behavior by "circular-stance-swimming," presumably to facilitate cleaner inspections. The cleaner-thresher shark association reflected some of the known behavioral trends in the cleaner-reef teleost system since cleaners appeared to forage selectively on shark clients. Evidence is mounting that in addition to acting as social refuges and foraging grounds for large visiting marine predators, seamounts may also support pelagic ecology by functioning as cleaning stations for oceanic sharks and rays...|$|E
