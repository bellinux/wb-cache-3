25|$|The {{construction}} process for this building was highly labor-intensive, {{as seen in}} the careful masonry, the elaborate terrazzo floor, and the use of parquet rather than strip flooring in the workroom and office areas.

25|$|Classical {{electromagnetism}} or classical electrodynamics is {{a branch}} of theoretical physics that studies the interactions between electric charges and currents using {{an extension of the}} classical Newtonian model. The theory <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> description of electromagnetic phenomena whenever the relevant length scales and field strengths are large enough that quantum mechanical effects are negligible. For small distances and low field strengths, such interactions are better described by quantum electrodynamics.|$|E
25|$|The mulga dragon (Caimanops amphiboluroides) is {{a species}} of agamid lizard found in Western Australia. The species grows up to 25cm long. The {{patterning}} over the legs and body is grey and brownish streaks.

25|$|The only {{case of a}} {{polygamous}} rabbi {{recorded in}} the Talmud <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> illustration: Rabbi Tarfon married 300 women. Why? Because there was a famine in the land. But Rabbi Tarfon had plenty of food, {{since he was a}} kohen and received the priestly tithes. The wife of a kohen is also permitted to eat those tithes. Those 300 women were very happy that the Torah permitted polygamy.|$|E
25|$|Each STR is polymorphic, but {{the number}} of alleles is very small. Typically each STR allele will be shared by around 5 - 20% of individuals. The power of STR {{analysis}} comes from looking at multiple STR loci simultaneously. The pattern of alleles can identify an individual quite accurately. Thus STR analysis <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> identification tool. The more STR regions that are tested in an individual the more discriminating the test becomes.|$|E
25|$|Hydrodemolition (also {{known as}} hydro demolition, hydroblasting, hydro blasting, hydromilling, waterblasting, and waterjetting) is a {{concrete}} removal technique which utilizes high-pressure water to remove deteriorated and sound concrete {{as well as}} asphalt and grout.

25|$|Heard Island is {{a heavily}} glacierized, subantarctic {{volcanic}} island {{located in the}} Southern Ocean, roughly 4000 kilometers southwest of Australia. 80% of the island is covered in ice, with glaciers descending from 2400 meters to sea level. Due to the steep topography of Heard Island, most of its glaciers are relatively thin (averaging only about 55 meters in depth). The presence of glaciers on Heard Island <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> opportunity to measure the rate of glacial retreat {{as an indicator of}} climate change.|$|E
25|$|Originally a land-locked {{fresh water}} lake, the Black Sea {{was flooded with}} salt water from the Mediterranean Sea during the Holocene. The influx of salt water {{essentially}} smothered the fresh water below it because a lack of internal motion and mixing meant that no fresh oxygen reached the deep waters, creating a meromictic body of water. The anoxic environment, which is hostile to many biological organisms that destroy wood in the oxygenated waters, <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> testing site for deep water archaeological survey.|$|E

25|$|Coral can {{reproduce}} sexually or asexually. In {{asexual reproduction}} (budding) a polyp divides in two genetically identical pieces. Sexual reproduction requires that a sperm fertilize an egg which grows into a larva. Currents then disperse the larvae. Growth begins when the larvae attach to a solid substrate. Old/dead coral <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> substrate for this growth, creating ever higher mounds of coral. As new growth surrounds the original, the new coral intercepts both water flow and accompanying nutrients, weakening and eventually killing the older organisms.|$|E

25|$|Squash <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> {{cardiovascular}} workout. In {{one hour}} of squash, a player may expend approximately 600 to 1000 food calories (3,000 to 4,000 kJ). The sport also provides a good upper and lower body workout by exercising both the legs in running around the court and the arms and torso in swinging the racket. In 2003, Forbes rated squash as the number one healthiest sport to play. However, some studies have implicated squash {{as a cause of}} possible fatal cardiac arrhythmia and argued that squash is an inappropriate form of exercise for older men with heart disease.|$|E
