5|$|On June 7, 1911, Madero entered Mexico City. In October 1911 he {{was elected}} president, {{under the banner of}} the Partido Constitucional Progresista, along with José María Pino Suárez, his new running mate as vice-president. Madero <b>pushed</b> <b>aside</b> Francisco Vázquez Gómez, the vice presidential {{candidate}} for the Anti-Reelectionist Party in 1910, as being too moderate.|$|E
5|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to kick off. Within ninety seconds, Stanley Mortensen sent a cross {{from the left}} wing to Roy Bentley, who let off a shot that was barely <b>pushed</b> <b>aside</b> by U.S. goalkeeper Frank Borghi. By the 12th minute, England had six clear shots on goal but could not convert, with two shots hitting the post, one just going over the top, and another brilliantly saved by Borghi.|$|E

5|$|After a {{short period}} of rest, the {{breakout}} began on 6 December with the 7th Marines as the vanguard of the retreating column while the 5th Marines covered the rear. At the same time, the much-delayed PVA 26th Corps arrived at Hagaru-ri with its 76th and 77th Division relieving the 58th and 60th Divisions. As the 7th Marines <b>pushed</b> <b>aside</b> the PVA 76th Division south of Hagaru-ri, the 5th Marines took over the Hagaru-ri perimeter and recaptured the East Hill from the 76th Division. In a last effort to stop the breakout, the customary Chinese night attack returned with the 76th and 77th Division striking the Hagaru-ri perimeter from all directions. The Marines repulsed the Chinese attacks, inflicting heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|With {{the recent}} {{volcanic}} activity starting in 2004, the glacier lobes were <b>pushed</b> <b>aside</b> and upward by {{the growth of}} new volcanic domes. The surface of the glacier, once mostly without crevasses, turned into a chaotic jumble of icefalls heavily criss-crossed with crevasses and seracs caused by movement of the crater floor. The new domes have almost separated the Crater Glacier into an eastern and western lobe. Despite the volcanic activity, the termini of the glacier have still advanced, with a slight advance on the western lobe and a more considerable advance on the more shaded eastern lobe. Due to the advance, two lobes of the glacier joined together in late May 2008 and thus the glacier completely surrounds the lava domes. In addition, since 2004, new glaciers have formed on the crater wall above Crater Glacier feeding rock and ice onto its surface below; there are two rock glaciers {{to the north of}} the eastern lobe of Crater Glacier. Crater Glacier is the only known advancing glacier in the contiguous United States.|$|E
5|$|After {{four minutes}} of deliberation, the jury's foreman {{announced}} a guilty verdict and {{a sentence of}} death. The trial lasted about one hour. Court officers approached Washington to escort him away, but were <b>pushed</b> <b>aside</b> by a surge of spectators, who seized Washington and dragged him outside. Washington initially fought back, biting one man, but was soon beaten. A chain was placed {{around his neck and}} he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob; on the way downtown, he was stripped, stabbed, and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects. By the time he arrived at city hall, a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next to a tree in front of the building. Washington, semiconscious and covered in blood, was doused with oil, hung from the tree by a chain, and then lowered to the ground. Members of the crowd cut off his fingers, toes, and genitals. The fire was lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered into the flames until he burned to death. German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase his suffering. Washington attempted to climb the chain, but was unable to, owing to his lack of fingers. The fire was extinguished after two hours, allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs from the site of the lynching, including Washington's bones and links of the chain. One attendee kept part of Washington's genitalia; a group of children snapped the teeth out of Washington's head to sell as souvenirs. By the time that the fire was extinguished, parts of Washington's arms and legs had been burned off and his torso and head were charred. His body was removed from the tree and dragged behind a horse throughout the town. Washington's remains were transported to Robinson, where they were publicly displayed until a constable obtained the body late in the day and buried it.|$|E

5|$|The subject came {{up again}} in 1930, during the Conference on Codification of International Law, held in The Hague. A strong {{contingent}} of women from America joined international women's groups to change the existing nationality laws, but the women were unable to agree on wording. Intense lobbying by women, and a massive parade demonstration, failed to influence the conferees, and the international law continued to hold that a woman's nationality followed her husband's. In response, Macmillan organised an International Committee for Action on the Nationality of Married Women early the next year. Six {{of the most influential}} international women's groups sought a broad base of support from working women. Macmillan's stated goal was to delay ratification of the Hague Convention, and to make certain that a woman's nationality would not change without her consent, and that the nationality of a couple's children would not be more influenced by the father's nationality. The new committee was successful in lobbying the League of Nations to address the problem, but when the League constituted a study group, that group was split between two intractable factions. On one side were those who wanted a married couple to have exactly one nationality, based on that of the husband, {{and on the other side}} were those like Macmillan who favoured independent citizenship between spouses, with the possibility of wives having different citizenship than their husbands, and children to be allowed dual citizenship. In 1932, the women's group, at an impasse, were <b>pushed</b> <b>aside</b> as ineffectual by the League of Nations, who decided in favour of ratifying the Hague Convention. The women's group disbanded, and the Hague convention was ratified in 1937.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the context}} of Cubism, artists were forced into the {{position}} of re-evaluating {{the role of the}} observer. Classical linear and aerial perspective, uninterrupted surface transitions and chiaroscuro were <b>pushed</b> <b>aside.</b> What remained was a series of images obtained by the observer (the artist) in different frames of reference as the object was being painted. Essentially, observations became linked through a system of coordinate transformations. The result was Metzinger's 'total image' or a combination of successive images.|$|E

25|$|Canadians had {{expected}} that women would feel {{sympathetic to the}} war efforts, {{but the idea that}} they would contribute in such a physical way was absurd to most. Because of the support that women had shown {{from the beginning of the}} war, people began to see their value. In May 1918, a meeting was held to discuss the possible creation of the Canadian Women's Corps. In September, the motion was approved, but the project was <b>pushed</b> <b>aside</b> because the war's end was in sight.|$|E
25|$|From about 1865 to 1914, Mississippi Choctaws {{were largely}} ignored by governmental, health, and {{educational}} services {{and fell into}} obscurity.

Records about the Mississippi Choctaw during this period are non-existent. They had no legal recourse, and were often bullied and intimidated by local whites, who tried to re-establish white supremacy.

25|$|In {{the early}} hours of 19 November, protesters broke into a side-entrance to the Legislative Council Complex, {{breaking}} glass panels with concrete tiles and metal barricades. Legislator Fernando Cheung and other suffragists tried to stop the radical activists, but were <b>pushed</b> <b>aside.</b> The break-in, which according to The Standard was instigated by Civic Passion, was criticised by the three main activist groups of the protests, and legislators from both the pan-democracy and pro-Beijing camps. Three police were injured and six men were arrested for criminal damage and assault.|$|E
25|$|He also {{introduced}} the major advance of hull shapes which can plane, and which can therefore reach {{beyond the usual}} speed limits for small sailing boats. In effect, a boat which is planing is skimming along the surface, with {{the bow of the}} boat not in the water. This results in less friction because of reduced waterline length, reduced displacement (the amount of water needing to be <b>pushed</b> <b>aside</b> by the boat), and reduced 'wetted area'. The driving force provided by the sails has to overcome less resistance, and therefore speed increases dramatically.|$|E

25|$|On 4 December 1522, Thomas Howard {{was made}} Lord Treasurer upon his father's {{resignation}} of the office, and on 21 May 1524, he succeeded his father as Duke of Norfolk.

In 1523, Wolsey had secured to the Duke of Suffolk the reversion of the office of Earl Marshal which had been held by Norfolk's father, and in 1525, the Duke of Richmond had replaced Norfolk as Lord Admiral.

25|$|From {{a social}} and {{cultural}} standpoint, the Old Casino is significant in that it expresses to this day the lifestyle of the area's wealthy families during {{the early decades of}} the 20th century.

The agreement contains a 4-page declaration, with four annexes (A–D) covering agriculture, non-agricultural market access, services, and trade facilitation, respectively. In addition, the agreement acknowledges the activities of other negotiating groups (such as those on rules, dispute settlement, and intellectual property) and exhorts them to fulfill their Doha round negotiating objectives.
