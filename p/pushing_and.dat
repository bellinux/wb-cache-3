5|$|On June 24, Philadelphia {{played at}} home versus the New York Cosmos of the second-tier North American Soccer League {{in what was}} only Curtin's second game as head coach. Overtime was again needed as the teams ended {{regulation}} tied at one apiece before Sébastien Le Toux scored the game-winner in the 115th minute. Shortly after the goal, a melee erupted between the teams that resulted in two Cosmos players and one Union player being sent off for <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> shoving. Two of New York's assistant coaches were also ejected for their parts in the disorder.|$|E
5|$|Ice sledge {{hockey is}} open only to male {{competitors}} with a physical disability {{in the lower}} part of their body. The game is played using international hockey rules with some modifications. Athletes sit on sledges with two blades that allow the puck to go beneath the sledge. They also use two sticks, which have a spike-end for <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> a blade-end for shooting. The athletes are classified into three groups: group 1 is for athletes with no sitting balance or with major impairment in both upper and lower limbs, group 2 is for athletes with some sitting balance and moderate impairment in their extremities and athletes in group 3 have good balance and mild impairment in their upper and lower limbs.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the success of the tour, the band was not without at least one serious altercation which has since been widely publicized. After playing a {{sell-out}} show in Glasgow, Scotland, members of the band and crew were involved in heavy drinking. After a brief amount of time, vocalist Randy Blythe, whilst wearing a quilt and attempting to speak with a Scottish accent, became verbally violent towards both drummer Chris Adler and guitarist Mark Morton, the later of whom then struck Blythe from behind on the bus in response. The incident developed into grabbing, <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> separating until Blythe and Morton then encountered each other outside on the footpath. The fight between the two was especially lackluster due to intoxication, however it resulted in Morton bringing Blythe down hard on the pavement beneath him briefly incapacitating Blythe. Two days and at least one show later, the duo reconciled over drinks.|$|E
40|$|Multi-agent Pathfinding is a {{relevant}} {{problem in a}} wide range of domains, for example in robotics and video games research. Formally, the problem considers a graph consisting of vertices and edges, and a set of agents occupying vertices. An agent can only move to an unoccupied, neighbouring vertex, and the problem of finding the minimal sequence of moves to transfer each agent from its start location to its destination is an NP-hard problem. We present <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Rotate, a new algorithm that is complete for Multi-agent Pathfinding problems in which there are at least two empty vertices. <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Rotate first divides the graph into subgraphs within which it is possible for agents to reach any position of the subgraph, and then uses the simple <b>push,</b> swap, <b>and</b> rotate operations to find a solution; a post-processing algorithm is also presented that eliminates redundant moves. <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Rotate can be seen as extending Luna <b>and</b> Bekris’s <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Swap algorithm, which we showed to be incomplete in a previous publication. In our experiments we compare our approach with the <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Swap, MAPP, and Bibox al-gorithms. The latter algorithm is restricted to a smaller class of instances as it requires biconnected graphs, but can nevertheless be considered state of the art due to its strong performance. Our exper-iments show that <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Swap suffers from incompleteness, MAPP is generally not competitive with <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Rotate, and Bibox is better than <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Rotate on randomly generated biconnected instances, while <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Rotate performs better on grids. 1...|$|R
40|$|Recent years’ {{terrorist}} attacks in Europe and the flow of foreign fighters joining the terrorist organisation Daesh, has made the understanding of radicalisation evermore crucial. This thesis investigates if <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors leading into violent Islamic extremism differentiate between men and women. Furthermore, it assesses how preventive measures from The United Kingdom, Sweden <b>and</b> Denmark targets <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors and if these are sensitive to sex. To fulfil this objective an exploratory thematic {{analysis was used to}} synthesise secondary qualitative research surrounding <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors. The <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factor analysis revealed three trends: there were limited variation in the overall categories describing the <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors present for men and women; what caused <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors to manifest differed according to sex; and, there were differences in how much men and women were affected by these factors. The assessment of prevention measures showed that none of the measures explicitly mentioned <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors, yet they all had the potential of targeting these. Sex was included in some aspects of the measures, but was not a consideration in relation to the targeting of <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors. The thesis ends with a discussion of what implications the found results have for practice and offers suggestions to how prevention measures can be improved...|$|R

5|$|The {{difference}} between teleosts and other bony fish lies mainly in their jaw bones; teleosts have a movable premaxilla and corresponding modifications {{in the jaw}} musculature which {{make it possible for}} them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. This is of great advantage, enabling them to grab prey and draw it into the mouth. In more derived teleosts, the enlarged premaxilla is the main tooth-bearing bone, and the maxilla, which is attached to the lower jaw, acts as a lever, <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling the premaxilla as the mouth is opened and closed. Other bones further back in the mouth serve to grind and swallow food. Another difference is that the upper and lower lobes of the tail (caudal) fin are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, distinguishing this group from other fish in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the tail fin.|$|E

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study aims at closing an inherent {{gap in the}} literature on research on private parks. Specifically, the aim of this study is threefold: (a) to identify the <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors that influence decisions to visit private parks; (b) to examine the differences in these <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors for different sociodemographic groups; and (c) to investigate the interrelationships among these <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull fac-tors. Data were collected from 228 visitors who were intercepted at various locations in a private park. The survey instrument assessed the reasons for visiting the park (<b>push</b> factors) <b>and</b> evaluated how well the park performed on a series of selected park attributes (pull factors). The results of a factor analysis revealed three <b>push</b> factors <b>and</b> three pull factors. Other analyses included an evaluation of the inter-relationship between these factors in terms of different sociodemographic subgroups and a general correlation analysis on the interrelationship among <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors. This study provides useful managerial and practical implications for park managers, policymakers and communication strategists to gain an understanding of how <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors affect tourists and their choice of private parks...|$|R

25|$|Due to a neck injury, Kokkai {{was forced}} to change his sumo style. He began to fight more on the mawashi, {{gripping}} his opponent's belt, switching from the <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> thrusting techniques he used earlier in his career. His profile at the Japan Sumo Association still lists tsuki/oshi as his favoured techniques, and his most common winning kimarite was oshi-dashi, or push-out, followed by yori-kiri, or force-out. He was also fond of using the slap-down (hataki-komi) and the pull-down (hiki-otoshi).|$|E
25|$|Penalties can {{be either}} {{technical}} or personal. Personal fouls such as cross-checking, illegal body check or slashing, are mostly about player safety. These fouls draw 1-minute or more penalties; the offending player must leave the field {{and stay in the}} substitution area for the length of the penalty. His team plays with nine players for the duration. Because of the offsides rule, this means the opponent plays with six attackers versus five defenders plus the goalie. Technical fouls, such as offsides, <b>pushing,</b> <b>and</b> holding, result in either a turnover or a 30-second penalty, depending on which team has the ball.|$|E
25|$|The {{murder of}} Severus Alexander by his {{soldiers}} {{and its aftermath}} which resulted in disturbances in Rome, motivated Ardashir to attack Rome again. In about the years 237-238, Ardashir took Nusaybin and Harran and attacked the city Dura; then he marched toward Hatra, which was a commercial city {{and the center of}} the traffic of commercial caravans. Hatra stood hard against the Persian siege and did not fall until April or September 240; it seems that Hatra was chosen as a point for <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> operation against Roman Mesopotamia. The fall of Hatra might have been the cause of Gordian III's wars with Persia.|$|E

25|$|Early in his career, {{under the}} {{instruction}} of his first stablemaster, Konishiki was primarily oshi-sumo specialist, preferring <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> thrusting techniques such as oshi-dashi and tsuki-dashi that would win the bout as quickly as possible. Following his knee problems in 1988 and 1989, his balance suffered and as his weight continued to increase he began to change his style, preferring to bide his time by grabbing the opponent's mawashi and rely on his huge weight advantage to wear them out. By 1992 he was winning virtually all his matches by yori-kiri (force out), and his lack of ability to change tack once he had been sidestepped {{was one of the}} concerns raised by the Yokozuna Deliberation Committee when he was up for promotion.|$|E
25|$|Hokutoumi was {{primarily}} a oshi-sumo specialist, preferring <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> thrusting techniques that got his opponents {{out of the ring}} as quickly as possible. He had a powerful tachi-ai, or initial charge, and his speciality was nodowa, a single-handed push to the throat. To do this he would lock up his opponent's right arm with his left (a technique known as ottsuke) and thrust with his right. His most common winning kimarite by far were oshi-dashi and yori-kiri, which together accounted for around 60 percent of his wins at sekitori level. When fighting on the mawashi he preferred a migi-yotsu (left hand outside, right hand inside) grip. He {{said in an interview with}} Channel 4 television that the technique he most enjoyed was tsuri-dashi or lift out, although he was only credited with this kimarite once in official tournament competition (against Terao in November 1989).|$|E

He urged Major General Edward Ord, who had been <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> encouraging his men of the XXIV Corps and two brigades of the 2nd Division (Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) William Birney's division, temporarily under Gibbon's command) of the XXV Corps (African-Americans) of the Army of the James to keep {{as close as possible}} to the cavalry. He also ordered Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Charles Griffin, whose V Corps was moving just behind Ord's men, to close up so the Confederates could not escape in the morning.|$|E

Although everyone is trying to push in a particular direction, there are no real organised teams.

Another of the Boggins' jobs is to stop the Sway destroying everything in its path.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, April 23, {{the most}} complex and thorny issues were debated. The first {{contentious}} issue on the agenda dealt with natural resources industries, such as the oil, gas, and mines, as it became the centre of a major showdown between the Waffle and the labour movement forces. The Waffle faction wanted total nationalization and public ownership of resource industries. The party establishment, and Labour, being more moderate, wanted only to expand public and co-operative ownership. The hour-long debate, quickly transcended into raucous name-calling and physical <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> shoving at the microphone stands. Sidney Green, Manitoba’s Minister of Mines and Resources in the NDP provincial government, spoke in favour of the moderate resolutions committee motion. He was countered on the convention floor by university professor Peter Usher, a Waffle member from Ottawa, who moved to refer the committee’s motion back for redrafting to push for nationalization of all resource industries. After much heated debate, his motion was defeated in a standing-count vote by a three to one margin. The standing vote was needed because Waffle members challenged two previous voting attempts. Once defeated, the Unity Group, and its labour supporters, pressed for {{the adoption of the}} original eight-point resolution, which then passed easily with a five to one plurality. With the Waffle’s amendment defeated, it seemed unlikely that they could pass other motions that called for the nationalization of other economic sectors like manufacturing, financial, and transportation.|$|E
