40|$|Purpose of the work: The aim of {{the study}} is to {{determine}} the performance of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> in Dutch mass-housing under realistic conditions with a view to shading, density, urban tissue and dwelling lay-out. Method of approach : The following <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> have been taken into consideration : wondow, greenhouse and trombe wall. The variables in the investigated models are with regard to the urban lay-out:. block, strip-like block and orientation. Concerning the houses the variables are: insulation, thermal mass, airchanges, V/A ratio and % glazing area. Significant results: The results show that <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> give only a small contribution to the heat need of a dwelling. Insulation and reduction of ventilation losses are more important to reach lowenergy housing. Urban lay-out and orientat ion don't have much influence. Prevention of shading is important in winter.

40|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> {{can be an}} {{efficient}} strategy to save energy both in new and retrofitted buildings, above all in the Mediterranean climatic zone. Over the last decades many <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> applications have, indeed, taken place in this area. Contrariwise, there are still few data about the actual performances of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> systems; scientific literature shows that studies are limited and often they refer to very peculiar climatic conditions. That happens, basically, because <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> are components of the building envelope, therefore they are dependant on specific environment, operating conditions and budget, hardly replicable and difficult to standardize; so that their performances are hard to evaluate. However, in spite of difficulties to obtain fair operational data it may be useful, for whoever intends to adopt <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> strategies, to acquire data about their potential performances. This article describes the monitoring actions conducted on <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>systems,</b> in particular on glasshouses and Trombe-Michel walls, applied in three retrofitted buildings, built in the sixties in Savona (Italy). The winter monitoring campaign {{has been carried out}} using temperature data loggers, a thermal imaging camera and an anemometer to measure low air velocities. Those monitoring actions are producing significant data concerning: the operation/efficiency of the checked systems, their performances according to solar radiation absorption, the mode/efficiency of heat transfer, the effect of the users’ behaviour, the validation of information in the literature. The case-studies show that <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> can ensure the necessary thermal transfer and a good indoor comfort in the Mediterranean climate, during not too harsh winters, on condition that the buildings are adequately insulated. Moreover the study remarks on the operating conditions of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> in relation to the convective heat transfer and the appropriate size of the wall valves as well. The article also shows some precautions to avoid <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> buildings’ overheating during summer and the monitoring campaign demonstrates that it is easily possible to avoid this problem. The research outputs may be significant in the design and research fields, particularly in order to build up databases able to lead to more reliable simulation systems...|$|R
50|$|In {{preparation}} for its opening, {{the building was}} renovated to be environmentally friendly. During the renovation, 80% of the materials that were removed were recycled. The landscaping was designed to require little water. The museum has non-reflective windows and exterior LED lights, which are energy-saving.

A rainwater collection system supplies water for landscaping and toilets and some of the building's energy is supplied from its <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> In 2013, he received the Pollution Prevention Champion Award from the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality for the environmental-friendly building.|$|E
50|$|In a direct-gain <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system,</b> {{the indoor}} space {{acts as a}} solar collector, heat absorber, and {{distribution}} system. South-facing glass in the northern hemisphere(north-facing in the southern hemisphere) admits solar energy into the building interior where it directly heats (radiant energy absorption) or indirectly heats (through convection) thermal mass in the building such as concrete or masonry floors and walls. The floors and walls acting as thermal mass are incorporated as functional parts {{of the building and}} temper the intensity of heating during the day. At night, the heated thermal mass radiates heat into the indoor space.|$|E
50|$|A {{roof pond}} <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system,</b> {{sometimes}} called a solar roof, uses water stored {{on the roof}} to temper hot and cold internal temperatures, usually in desert environments. It typically is constructed of containers holding 6 to 12 in (150 to 300 mm) of water on a flat roof. Water is stored in large plastic bags or fiberglass containers to maximize radiant emissions and minimize evaporation. It can be left unglazed or can be covered by glazing. Solar radiation heats the water, which acts as a thermal storage medium. At night or during cloudy weather, the containers can be covered with insulating panels. The indoor space below the roof pond is heated by thermal energy emitted by the roof pond storage above. These systems require good drainage systems, movable insulation, and an enhanced structural system to support a 35 to 70 lb/ft2 (1.7 to 3.3 kN/m2) dead load.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{relationships}} between the performances, constraints, and problems identified by the respondents and the inclusion of each of three types of passive solar system: direct gain, Trombe wall, or greenhouse, into the design. The objectives of this study were: 1) to describe the respondents and their houses, 2) to determine whether or not there were relationships between performances and types of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system,</b> 3) to determine whether or not there were relationships between constraints and types of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system,</b> and 4) to determine whether or not there were relationships between problems and types of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> To determine the relationships, hypotheses were tested. The data for the analyses were obtained from a survey, "Post Occupancy Evaluation of Passive Solar Homes in Oregon. " In June 1982, mail questionnaires were sent to the sample of 154, selected from a list of applicants for residential passive solar tax credits from Oregon Department of Energy. The Mann-Whitney test was utilized to test relationships between performances and types of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> and between constraints and types of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> The t-test was employed to determine whether there were relationships between overall performances and types of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> and between overall constraints and types of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> The chi-square statistical test was used to determine whether there were relationships between problems and types of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> Frequency distributions were utilized to develop descriptions of respondents and their houses. Respondents were characterized as males, median age of 41 years, four-year college graduates, with a median gross family income in the category of 30, 000 through 39, 999. The respondents lived in houses characterized as detached single family with a combination of direct gain and greenhouse passive solar systems with concrete heat storage and a size in the category of 1500 through 1999 square feet. The majority of houses were located outside city limits and sited true south, while the median number of rooms in houses was six. There were significant (p≤. 05) differences in the occurrences of problems with: 1) coverings for sloped windows (p=. 0062), 2) excessive glare (p=. 0469), and 3) excessive humidity (p=. 0371) between greenhouse and non-greenhouse houses. Although few respond ents reported these three problems, greenhouse respondents had more problems with 1) coverings for sloped windows and 2) excessive humidity while non-greenhouse respondents had more of a problem with excessive glare. This study investigated relationships between performances, constraints, and problems and types of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> The description of the respondents and their houses and the null hypotheses findings will be very important for educators and researchers concerned with housing, professionals in the housing industry, current and future occupants of solar houses, and politicians when they consider laws affecting housing programs. For example, the finding that greenhouse respondents had more problems with coverings for sloped windows and excessive humidity while non-greenhouse respondents had more of a problem with excessive glare will be especially important for architects and builders to know as they explore ways to improve the design of solar housing...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} {{alternative energy sources}} – a solar system and a heat pump. Their operation is energy-advantageous {{and they can be}} efficiently connected in one system. The focus of this thesis is firstly to give an overview of kinds, function, properties, constructional elements and usual arrangements of active and passive solar systems and heat pumps in connection with heating of buildings, secondly to suggest a connection of a combined heating system with a heat pump and of a <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> and to evaluate it from an energetic and economic point of view. Firstly, a basic theory for calculation of quantity of electrical energy absorbed by a surface is introduced. Then, a categorization and construction of active and passive systems are presented. Hereafter, advantages and disadvantages of single solar systems are described and basic calculation relations for determination of a heat gain and of proportions of passive solar systems are showed. Subsequently, the function of a heat pump is analyzed, the categorization of its kinds according to the relevant criteria is given and its basic functional elements, typical properties and means of possible use are described. On the basis of gained knowledge, conditions of cooperation of a heat pump with a <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> are summarized and substantiated. According to these conditions and to the construction of an object, a combined system is designed for, a connection of a system with a heat pump air / water, a heat accumulator and a recuperative unit is constructed. Consequential calculations evaluate energetic needs of an object and heat gains of a <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> They serve as a basis for a concept of heat source and for determination of an energy balance. A total annual heat need is 13914, 7 kWh. It was compared with the case when the object was equipped with standard-size windows. The comparison shows that a <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> can spare roughly one third of total annual heat consumption. From the measurement on the object is determined, when a <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> is able to supply a heat pump with heat. After that, the suggested system is evaluated from an economic point of view: it is compared with other possible heat sources by the method of net present value. It can be said that solid fuel firing and gas firing are economically more advantageous than the use of a heat pump. The reasons are particularly high initial costs and in case of wood firing also its low price. In conclusion, the gained results are summarized...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{analytical and}} experimental methods of studying {{various aspects of}} the optical and thermal performance of a transwall <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> Some of these methods are applicable to other solar systems. Two ray-tracing techniques, 1 -dimensional and 3 -dimensional, are presented for an accurate calculation of the optical properties of a transwall module with its outside glass plate(s). These techniques calculate not only the reflected, absorbed or transmitted fractions of the incident radiation but also the spectrum of the transmitted radiation. This information is required for a better assessment of the transwall system as an illuminating source and as a thermal system. Both techniques are applied to a particular transwall module with one outside glass plate and the importance of various features of the incident solar radiation (such as spectrum, angular variation, polarization, etc.) are discussed. The difficulties associated with the nature of the diffuse solar radiation coming from the sky, or the ground, are overcome by employing a discretization method in which the continuous diffuse radiation is divided into discrete pencils of radiation. An analytical thermal model of a <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> is presented and its verification is established by using a test-box containing a full size transwall module. The outcome of this verification is satisfactory given the uncertainties of the optical and thermal properties of the various elements of the test-box. The success of the analytical modelling depends on accounting for the 3 -dimensional solar radiation field outside and inside the <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> The methods developed, accompanied by the two ray-tracing techniques, allow for an accurate distribution of the total incident radiation among the semitransparent elements and the external and internal surfaces of any passive system. The method of distributing the solar radiation among the internal surfaces of an enclosure is applied to the convex parallelepiped enclosure of the test-box and, as additional example of the method, also applied to the non-convex enclosure of a typical glasshouse with E-w transwalls. The phenomenon of the natural convection of a fluid inside a transwall module induced by the absorption of radiation is predicted by a numerical method, first introduced by Patankar. Examples of the temperature, pressure and velocity fields of three transwall modules filled with distilled water under the irradiance conditions of 400 to 500 W/m 2 are presented. By introducing the effective conductivity concept the complicated phenomenon of the fluid convection inside the module is simplified to a conduction phenomenon. This is also necessary for the long term-days or months - analytical modelling of the total transwall passive system because the numerical prediction of the former phenomenon requires an excessive amount of computer time. The calculation of the effective conductivity is obtained by employing an analytical approach which makes use of the data collected from the application of the numerical method, mentioned above. Values of the ratio of the effective conductivity to the conductivity of the still water are calculated at two interfaces inside the water of four different transwall modules. Measurements of the temperature and the velocity at certain points in a small transwall module irradiated by a solar simulator have been performed to support some of the numerical predictions...|$|E

40|$|Publicado em "Proceedings of the 7 th International Conference on Safety and Durability of Structures: ICOSADOS 2016 "A phase-change {{material}} (PCM) is {{a substance}} {{with a high}} heat of fusion which, melting and solidifying at a certain temperature, is capable of storing and releasing large amounts of energy. Heat is absorbed or released when the material changes from solid to liquid and vice versa; thus, PCMs are classified as latent heat storage (LHS) units. The work {{presented in this paper}} is related to the study of a <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> applied in facades with Trombe wall. In particular it was evaluated the effect of the incorporation of phase changing materials (PCM's) was assessed using namely PCM based on paraffin and another one based on octadecane. For this purpose, firstly an experimental campaign conducted at BraganÃ§a Polytechnic Institute was performed in order to evaluate the blending mode of all the constituents of the mortar, the content of PCM to incorporate in the mortar as well as the involved water quantity, including mechanical characterization of the mortar with and without PCM. The second part was devoted to the study of tests models using cement mortar and an appropriate geometry, by exposure to atmospheric thermal action. With data acquisition equipment it was possible to obtain temperature records and thermal conductivity of the main facade elements in 10 to 10 minutes intervals and so it was possible to establish a comparison between the tested models. Main conclusions of this work are that the incorporation of PCM's into thermal mortars can bring benefits in terms of thermal comfort, greater efficiency and sustainability to buildings, as well as improve the efficiency of Trombe wall building system...|$|E
40|$|As many future home {{owners and}} {{professionals}} in the building industry are looking for existing solar buildings to find out information on features such as their appearance, price ranges, {{and the effectiveness of}} solar heating design, this thesis intends to provide that information and will assess a variety of passive solar buildings in Tasmania. This thesis will catalogue ten Tasmanian passive solar buildings and particularly highlight the following factors: a) the theoretical concepts of using passive solar designs; b) the appearance and architectural layout of the passive solar buildings; c) how, and how effectively, the <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> works; d) the problems (if any) related to the actual construction and maintenance of the solar systems; and e) the owner's own personal experience living and using such a solar building. The thesis is presented in two major parts. The first part, consisting of Chapter Two and Three, introduces some theoretical aspects of passive solar design and briefly reviews several other surveys of solar buildings. Chapter Two looks at aspects of thermal comfort and shows why space heating is such an important factor in Tasmania. This is then related to the various key components of passive solar design as they apply in the State. Chapter Three demonstrates that the technique of cataloguing existing solar buildings is a valid and useful means of advancing {{the state of the art}} in solar design, but that regional differences in climate, building practice, and lifestyle mean that these catalogues should be prepared for a particular region to be most effective. The second part of this thesis catalogues and evaluates ten passive solar buildings, all situated in Tasmania. Documentation of each of these buildings is presented in two parts, first, the technical aspects of the building are explained and, secondly, an owner analysis of the building's performance is given...|$|E
40|$|This work {{enhances the}} {{application}} of a clear and concise methodology to help choosing the most accurate <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> techniques according to local climate and its influence on construction. To carry out these goals, the analysis of concepts of fictitious temperatures, the psicrometric diagram and its relation to <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> zones previously established and, finally, the constructive changes that each technique requires is needed. This last factor mentioned took into account the technological and scientific knowledge, as well as the current constructive solutions applicable in the building construction sector in Portugal. The article clears these questions from the design point of view, establishing a straight interdependence between theoretic concepts and its practical application, framed by a context of optimisation, adopting the Portuguese traditional construction as the experimental scenario...|$|R
40|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>solar</b> energy {{design is}} not an exact science in which a set of {{analytical}} procedures can be followed to produce results. Rather it depends heavily on subjective parameters and experience collected over time which is heuristic by nature. At present this knowledge is available in books but while this knowledge is comprehensive, it is unstructured and {{not always easy to}} make use of. A computer-based system allows for flexible interactive dialogue and for the incorporation of analytical procedures which may be required. This paper describes work on SOLAREXPERT, a prototype expert system to aid designers in <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> energy design for single dwellings. The system operates at a strategic level to provide basic advice on the form of construction and types of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> and at a spatial zone level to provide more detailed advice on sizes and materials. It allows for modification of the information entered so that users may explore several possibilitie...|$|R
40|$|An {{office and}} {{exhibition}} building was constructed at Zwiesel in the Bayerischer Wald mountains. The building is heated by optimized active and <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> and requires no fossil fuels. The active and passive systems were carefully balanced. Regional construction techniques were used, {{especially for the}} timbering, and regionally available materials were preferred. Various wooden window systems were tested which all meet the standard for passive buildings. The building has a 110 m" 2 solar collector integrated in the southern wall which heats a central buffer store which in turn heats the building in all seasons.
