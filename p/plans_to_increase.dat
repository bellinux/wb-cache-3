5|$|The {{storm was}} {{expected}} to impact operations regarding the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, with both containment and cleanup operations being affected by repercussions from the storm (such as wave action and wind direction).

5|$|The {{contracted}} {{batch of}} 15 Saturn Vs were enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites, with <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> {{the mass of}} the CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.|$|E
5|$|To {{increase}} capacity on South West Trains' (SWT) overcrowded suburban services into Waterloo, there have, {{for several}} years, been <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> train lengths from eight carriageways to ten. This {{would require the}} lengthening of platforms and in particular platforms 1 to 4, would entail a substantial re-positioning of track-work and points. SWT also says it would need {{to have access to}} at least three of the currently disused international platforms 20 to 24. Further progress depends on decisions by the Government, and SWT says that until then it cannot proceed with ordering longer trains. In May 2016, it was announced that platforms 1 to 4 would be lengthened to allow new ten-car Class 707 trains to run. Work started on 5 August 2017, and was completed on 28 August.|$|E

5|$|In June 1976, {{a series}} of protests took place across {{communist}} Poland soon after the government announced <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> sharply the fixed prices charged nationwide for many basic commodities. Violent incidents occurred in Płock, Radom and Ursus as the protests were forcibly put down, and the planned price hikes were cancelled. These demonstrations and the events surrounding them brought the Polish workforce and intellectual political opposition together, and by 1980, a campaign of civil resistance for political change was intensifying strongly. Industrial strike action in Lublin in July 1980—the so-called Lublin July—preceded the formation of Solidarity (Solidarność) in {{the port city of}} Gdańsk during the following months. This was the first non-communist trade union in an Eastern bloc country. The government took several steps to obstruct Solidarity's emergence, enforcing press censorship and cutting off telephone connections between the coast and the hinterland, but despite these efforts four out of every five Polish workers were members of the union by late 1980.|$|E
5|$|In response, on 29 March, the British Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha {{announced}} <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> the Territorial Army (TA) from 130,000 men to 340,000 and in {{so doing}} double the number of territorial divisions. The intended plan of action was for the existing units to recruit over their allowed establishments (aided by an increase in pay for territorials, the removal of restrictions on promotion that had been a major hindrance to recruiting during the preceding years, the construction of better quality barracks, and an increase in supper-time rations) and then form 'second-line' divisions from small cadres that could be built upon. As a result, the 61st Infantry Division was to be created as a second-line unit, a duplicate of the first-line 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division. In April, limited conscription was introduced. At that time 34,500 'Militiamen', all of the age of 20, were conscripted into the regular army with the intent of being trained for six months before being deployed to the forming second line units. However, despite the intention for the army to grow in size, the programme was complicated by a lack of central guidance on the expansion and duplication process, and issues regarding the lack of facilities, equipment, and instructors.|$|E
