5|$|Although much of {{the upper}} reaches are now {{designated}} as leisure routes, there is still significant commercial traffic on the navigation. 300,000 tons were carried in 2007, {{although most of the}} traffic is now petroleum and gravel, rather than the coal which kept the navigation <b>profitable</b> <b>for</b> 150 years.|$|E
5|$|Our World premiered to {{indifferent}} critical response but as {{the series}} progressed critics became effusive with their praise. Despite being critically well received and <b>profitable</b> <b>for</b> the network, Our World performed poorly in the Nielsen ratings, as its first half-hour was programmed against the extremely popular The Cosby Show. ABC canceled the show after one season. Ellerbee tried to move the series to PBS but was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The brand {{was created}} {{around the same}} time as Japanese rivals Nissan and Honda {{developed}} their Infiniti and Acura premium brands. The Japanese government imposed voluntary export restraints for the U.S. market, so it was more <b>profitable</b> <b>for</b> Japanese automakers to export more expensive cars to the U.S.|$|E

5|$|A former Intel {{official}} {{reported that}} the Itanium business had become <b>profitable</b> <b>for</b> Intel in late 2009. By 2009, the chip was almost entirely deployed on servers made by HP, which had over 95% of the Itanium server market share, making the main operating system for Itanium HP-UX. On March 22, 2011, Intel reaffirmed its commitment to Itanium with multiple generations of chips in development and on schedule.|$|E
5|$|His law {{practice}} had many influential clients, including Lord Braco and {{the sons of}} Lord Fraser of Lovat. Pitfour was one of 15 advocates acting in a case raised by Alexander Fraser against Lord Fraser claiming the liferents to the Lovat estates. Eventually a compromise was reached; Lovat retained the liferents and Fraser gained a monetary sum instead. As the negotiations had taken many hours of legal deliberation over a three-year period, the case proved very <b>profitable</b> <b>for</b> Pitfour.|$|E

5|$|Rockefeller, who had rarely sold shares, {{held over}} 25% of Standard's stock {{at the time}} of the breakup. He and all of the other {{stockholders}} received proportionate shares in each of the 34 companies. In the aftermath, Rockefeller's control over the oil industry was somewhat reduced but over the next 10 years, the breakup also proved immensely <b>profitable</b> <b>for</b> him. The companies' combined net worth rose fivefold and Rockefeller’s personal wealth jumped to $900 million.|$|E
5|$|San {{hunter and}} gatherers, {{ancestors}} of the Khoisani peoples, were the first known inhabitants of the region that is now Mozambique, followed in the 1st and 4th centuries by Bantu-speaking peoples who migrated there across the Zambezi River. In 1498, Portuguese explorers landed on the Mozambican coastline. Portugal's influence in East Africa grew throughout the 16th century; she established several colonies known collectively as Portuguese East Africa. Slavery and gold became <b>profitable</b> <b>for</b> the Europeans; influence was largely exercised through individual settlers {{and there was no}} centralised administration and, in the meantime, Portugal had turned her attention to India and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of Mashonaland {{did not immediately}} prove <b>profitable</b> <b>for</b> the Company or its investors, {{partly because of the}} costly police force, which Rhodes dramatically downsized in 1891 to save money. There also existed the problem of land ownership; Britain recognised the Company's subsoil rights in Mashonaland, but not its possession of the land itself, and the Company therefore could not grant titles to land or accept rents and other payments from farmers.|$|E

5|$|The {{company was}} <b>profitable</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time}} in the second quarter of 2014, as a result of {{increasing}} ad spending by business owners and possibly from changes in Google's local search algorithm. It is dubbed as Google Pigeon, which helped authoritative local directory sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor, in getting more visibility. Over the course of the year, Yelp websites were launched in Mexico, Japan and Argentina. Also in 2014, Yelp expanded in Europe through the acquisitions of German-based restaurant review site Restaurant-Kritik and French-based CityVox.|$|E
5|$|The {{inhabitants}} {{were growing}} desperate {{to remove their}} belongings from the City, especially the upper class. This provided a {{source of income for}} the able-bodied poor, who hired out as porters (sometimes simply making off with the goods), and it was especially <b>profitable</b> <b>for</b> the owners of carts and boats. Hiring a cart had cost a couple of shillings on the Saturday before the fire; on Monday, it rose to as much as £40, a fortune equivalent to more than £4,000 in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Yelp {{was founded}} in 2004 by former PayPal {{employees}} Russel Simmons and Jeremy Stoppelman. Yelp grew quickly and raised several rounds of funding. By 2010 it had $30 million in revenues and the website had published more than 4.5 million crowd-sourced reviews. From 2009 to 2012, Yelp expanded throughout Europe and Asia. In 2009 it entered several negotiations with Google for a potential acquisition. Yelp became a public company in March 2012 and became <b>profitable</b> <b>for</b> the first time two years later. As of 2016, Yelp.com has 135 million monthly visitors and 95 million reviews. The company's revenues come from businesses advertising.|$|E

5|$|As previous, the Swedish {{authorities}} {{continued to}} subsidize freight operations on their side, making it <b>profitable</b> <b>for</b> Swedish exports to go via the Baltic Sea. Hopes in Trondheim {{to act as}} a major transit port for Swedish cargo never materialized. The 1966 opening of Norske Skog Skogn paper mill saw an increase in transport of lumber from Sweden. The petroleum transport lasted until the 1980s, when the Muruvik terminal was sold to Norwegian interests. A major customer was still Meråker Smelteverk, who used designated trains to haul ore from Muruvik to Kopperå and microsilica in return. By 1980, cargo volumes were up to the level seen during World War I.|$|E
5|$|Before {{moving into}} politics, {{he worked for}} the Insurance Company of North America from 1948 to 1955. Starting in 1955, he worked for a company called Gradmann und Holler, an {{insurance}} broker company for large businesses. Kiep owned 15 percent of the company in 1982. His involvement with Gradmann und Holler sparked controversy. When Kiep became minister in Lower Saxony in 1976, Volkswagen and other local companies went into business with Gradmann und Holler, creating a possible conflict of interest for the minister. Kiep also served on Volkswagen's board of directors. Kiep denied abusing his power as minister, saying that the deal with Volkswagen had been financially damaging rather than <b>profitable</b> <b>for</b> his company. Due to his successful business ventures, Kiep was considered {{to be one of the}} richest politicians in Germany. In an interview, Kiep told Playboy that he could live well just from the interest from his savings.|$|E
5|$|Five of the state's {{counties}} are wholly {{within the boundaries}} of sovereign Indian reservations. Because of the limitations of climate and land, and isolation from urban areas with more employment opportunities, living standards on many South Dakota reservations are often far below the national average; Ziebach County ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009. The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson, on the Crow Creek Reservation, is 70%, and 21% of households lack plumbing or basic kitchen appliances. A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Bureau found 58% of homes on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation did not have a telephone. The reservations' isolation also inhibits their ability to generate revenue from gaming casinos, an avenue that has proved <b>profitable</b> <b>for</b> many tribes closer to urban centers.|$|E

5|$|From 1808, {{a number}} of detractors argued that the {{navigation}} was in a poor condition, hoping to force Hollis to concede water rights to mills, and traffic declined. Another Act of 1811 allowed Hollis to raise the tolls, and eight years later, he held {{a meeting at the}} Winchester Guildhall, explaining why he needed to raise the tolls further. The meeting asked him to postpone his next Bill for a year, in return for which they would give him £1,200 for one year's tolls, wharfage and rent, he would spend £600 on repairs, and the remaining £600 would amount to 5 per cent interest on the estimated value of the navigation, which was then £12,000. He obtained his Act of Parliament a year later, which raised the tolls, but the Commissioners reduced freight charges at the same time, resulting in the operation being more <b>profitable</b> <b>for</b> Hollis and less so for the barge owners.|$|E
5|$|In the mid- to late 1970s Kujau, an able amateur artist, {{turned to}} {{producing}} paintings which he claimed were by Hitler, {{who had been}} an amateur artist as a young man. Having found a market for his forged works, Kujau created Hitler paintings depicting subjects his buyers expressed interest in, such as cartoons, nudes and men in action—all subjects that Hitler never painted, or would want to paint, according to Charles Hamilton, a handwriting expert and author of books on forgery. These paintings were often accompanied by small notes, purportedly from Hitler. The paintings were <b>profitable</b> <b>for</b> Kujau. To explain his access to the memorabilia he invented several sources in East Germany, including a former Nazi general, the bribable director of a museum and his own brother, who he re-invented as a general in the East German army.|$|E
5|$|Leopold, however, {{reneged on}} his {{humanitarian}} promises, and instead brutally exploited the locals {{and the land}} to gain what profit he could. Initially, the Congo Free State relied on exporting ivory to pay for its upkeep and to fund the Congo Arab war and Emin Pasha Relief Expedition in the Eastern Congo. As rubber became an important resource in the 1890s, it quickly surpassed ivory as a profitable export, which allowed the colony to become extremely <b>profitable</b> <b>for</b> the first time. Monopoly concessions to collect rubber in large areas of territory were sold to private companies, and the Force Publique, the state's private army, was used to force locals to collect it. In some cases, Congolese people who failed to meet their quota were killed or had one of their hands cut off. The system was immensely profitable, but {{the population of the}} Congo is thought to have been reduced by as many as ten million during the period that the colony was under Leopold's control.|$|E
