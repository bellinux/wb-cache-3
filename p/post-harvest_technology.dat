40|$|Ensuring {{that the}} post-harvest process yields good quality cocoa is a {{relevant}} research question. However, the literature currently lacks detailed studies of producers’ criteria for <b>post-harvest</b> <b>technology</b> selection. There {{is therefore a}} need for research that examines technology choice based on several criteria. This is the aim of our paper. We defined a cocoa <b>post-harvest</b> <b>technology</b> selection model to assist small producers in Ecuador. To do so, we employed the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to assess the following criteria: quality, processing cost and technology adoption capability. By considering only quality, we first performed a preliminary assessment of nine post-harvest technologies yielded by all possible combinations of fermentation and drying methods. Under the criterion “quality”, results show that no <b>post-harvest</b> <b>technology</b> is preferable to another. This implies that quality differences between producers do not derive from technology choice but rather from the rigour with which producers perform fermentation and drying processes. After adding the criteria “processing cost” and “technology adoption capability”, we performed the analysis again. This multi-criteria approach offered {{a better way to}} approximate small farmers’ real needs when selecting technology for cocoa post-harvest. Although quality was the highest-valued criterion, high scores attributed to some technologies in the other two criteria offset scores for quality. Thus, processing cost and technology adoption also emerged as relevant factors for small holders. </p...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that post-harvest losses in cassava crops occur in {{processing}} rather than in storage. The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (llTA) 's <b>Post-Harvest</b> <b>Technology</b> Unit has carried out surveys on how to eliminate loss at the family processing levels, and on how to increase the productivity of the women who do most of the processing in rural areas. The loss per family averages 2200 kg per 10 tonnes/hectare, equivalent to 2954 man hours per ten tonnes per hectare. IITA is encouraging the establishment of village processing centres where fresh cassava tubers are weighed and are given in exchange for already processed food, produced on the spot with the aid of simple and appropriate technologies. Standard measures would be available to gauge the weight of the finished products, which are produced under hygienic conditions. Dr Y W Jeon of IITA says this technology will help check food loss, encourage cooperative development, raise the standard of living in rural areas, and free women for other activities. Similar centres for the processing of soybeans have already been set up by IITA at Ijaiye near Ibadan, and any profits made there are used to improve and equip the centre. All local women may bring their food crops there for processing in exchange for the finished product. Other centres, such as that at Moniya, have a biogas generating unit incorporated.

30|$|With the {{emergence}} of simple <b>post-harvest</b> <b>technologies,</b> storage losses in cowpea can now be controlled {{without the use of}} pesticides. Many storage facilities have emerged, but sometimes are too expensive for many smallholder farmers in the tropics and sub-tropics to afford. Also, most of these farmers are not able to purchase pesticides to control pests and diseases during storage. Although the use of chemicals still remains a principal approach to solving post-harvest losses among many smallholder farmers, misuse of insecticides is common and causes health and environmental problems [1, 7]. The use of metal silos for storing grains, for instance, is only limited to the temperate regions. When used in hot, humid climates and semi-tropical regions, they produced negative results by causing humidity damage to the stored commodities [8]. It was further explained that during storage, grains experiencing too high temperature, adequate oxygen, and high relative humidity lead to the formation of molds which deteriorate grain quality. For most smallholder farmers in Africa, hermetic storage could be a practical approach because it is chemical-free and offers a cost-effective way of controlling insects during storage, thereby maintaining the quality of the grain [9 – 11]. Hermetic storage principally occurs in a controlled environment which continuously depletes oxygen and simultaneously increases carbon dioxide {{as a result of the}} respiratory activities of insects in the ecological system of a sealed storage [12]. According to [10], grain losses may vary depending on the geographical location, the year, the atmospheric condition, the available <b>post-harvest</b> <b>technologies,</b> and finally the amount of grain harvested. Due to the many factors influencing the rate of grain deterioration, it is exceedingly difficult to quantify the losses in stored grain [13]. This work therefore took a major step to evaluate the effect of hermetic and non-hermetic storage on moisture content, insect infestation, grain mass, and usable proportion of grains obtained from a local farmer in Ghana.|$|R
