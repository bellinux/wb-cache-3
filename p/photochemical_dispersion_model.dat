Thus, the survey was designed to contribute to scientific conclusions as regards the effectiveness of ozone abatement strategies. Furthermore, taking into account the ongoing political discussions to advance legislation for ozone abatement at federal and at state levels, the survey's results were to contribute to improving the basis for decision-making.

The system {{is based on}} the RAMS meteorological forecasting model and the CALGRID <b>photochemical</b> grid <b>dispersion</b> <b>model.</b> In the present study a comprehensive application of RAMS-CALMET-CALGRID has been carried out on a seasonal basis over Tuscany region, Italy. The study area is 184 x 224 Km 2 wide, made of a 45 x 55 x 12 3 -D computational grid, with a horizontal resolution of 4 Km. The modelling system has been applied in a long term mode on a five-month long (May to September 2002) time period, which can be certainly reckoned as the most original part of the work. As a matter of fact, a number of strong modifications in the original CALGRID code proved to be necessary to let the model run continuously all over the five months of simulation. The SAPRC- 90 “lumped ” chemical mechanism developed by Carter has been used to lump all VOCs involved in the O 3 formation and removal processes in the atmosphere. Concerning emission data, all point, line and area sources within the whole region were provided by the regional emission inventory. As far as initial and boundary conditions are concerned, they have been provided as outputs by the CAMx <b>dispersion</b> <b>model</b> applied by CESIRICERCA in the framework of a project aimed at evaluating atmospheric pollution over Italy.

40|$|Construction {{equipment}} {{can be a}} {{major source}} of ozone pre-cursor emissions in air quality non-attainment regions. Construction equipment emissions represent 8. 7 tons of NOx per day in the San Antonio, Texas region or approximately 4 % of the total NOx emissions. The location of construction projects can {{have a significant impact on}} pollutant measurements at down-wind monitoring sites; thus, it is important to allocate construction equipment emissions accurately. Default spatial allocation of construction equipment emissions, which allocates emissions to all urban areas, is often inaccurate due to construction occurring at the outer edges of urban areas where new housing, commercial development, and roads are being built. In addition, large mining sites can also be a source of significant construction equipment emissions. To improve the spatial allocation of construction equipment emissions for <b>photochemical</b> and other <b>dispersion</b> <b>models,</b> construction equipment was divided into sectors based on type and purpose of equipment usage.

The {{objective of this}} survey 'Programme of Control Concepts and Measures for Ozone' is defined as determination and evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} large-scale and of local emission control measures on elevated ground-level ozone concentrations in mid-summer episodes. Thus, the survey was designed to contribute to scientific conclusions as regards the effeceffectiveness of ozone abatement strategies. The survey programme is broken down in two phases. Phase A: Analysis of the efficiency of measures within the large-scale (nation-wide) domain, applying <b>photochemical</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>model</b> calculations and simulations on a coarser (mesoscale) grid. Phase B: Analysis of the efficiency of measures at local level in three selected model regions, using <b>photochemical</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>model</b> calculations with a high spatial resolution (fine grid). The photochemical model simulations are preceded by comprehensive analysis of the efficiency of a wide spectrum of potential measures to reduce emissions of ozone precursors NOx and VOCs, in order to assess the reduction rates of realistic and policy-oriented control strategies (such as speed limits, driving restrictions, etc.). The photochemcial simulations are therefore not based on simple overall reduction rates but on rates for various defined measures and for sets of measures (scenarios), each of them highly differentiated in terms of sector, time, substance and location. In order to validate the findings of the study, two different photochemical modelling systems (EURAD and REM 3 /CALGRID) have been applied. Both are complex three-dimensional Eulerian model systems.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the influence of clouds on ozone on a regional scale (Europe) with a regional scale <b>photochemical</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>model</b> (LOTOS). The LOTOS-model calculates ozone and other photo-oxidant concentrations in the lowest three km of the troposphere, using actual meteorologic data and emissions. We accounted for the altered radiative transfer in clouds and aqueous-phase chemistry (with and without iron and copper reactions in the aqueous phase). These cloud effects have been tested separately to distinguish their individual contribution to the ozone formation/degradation. Furthermore we estimated the effect of wet deposition parameterizing a upper-limit scavenging rate Model results are shown for a cloudy period in August 1990. We find for this period that the radiative effect of clouds lead, locally, to ozone reductions in the planetary boundary layer {{by as much as}} 22 %; overall to a reduction of ozone of 4 %. This coincides with a reduction of 14 % of the net ozone formation. When aqueous-phase chemistry was added the net ozone formation and concentration were further reduced, up to 20 % and 5 %, respectively. Although aqueous-phase chemistry can lead to a strong reduction of ozone formation in the cloud (up to 110 %), the overall effect is limited by the cloud volume fraction, cloud liquid water content and pH. The iron and copper reactions change the aqueous-phase reaction pathways substantially and render the droplet roughly a four times smaller sink for ozone...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a <b>photochemical</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>model,</b> CAMx (Comprehensive Air quality Model with eXtensions) {{was used}} to {{simulate}} a high ozone episode observed in the Po basin during the 2003 FORMAT (Formaldehyde as a Tracer of Oxidation in the Troposphere) campaign. The study focuses on formaldehyde and ozone, and a budget analysis was set up for interpreting the importance of different processes, namely emission, chemistry, transport and deposition, for three different areas (urban, downwind, suburban) around the Milan metropolitan region. In addition, a sensitivity study was carried out based on 11 different VOC emission scenarios. The results of the budget study show that the strongest O- 3 production rate (4 ppbv/hour) occurs in the downwind area {{of the city of}} Milan, and that accumulated O 3 is transported back to Milan city during nighttime. More than 80 % of the HCHO concentration over the Milan metropolitan region is secondary, i. e., photochemically produced from other VOCs. The sensitivity study shows that the emissions of isoprene are not, on average, a controlling factor for the peak concentrations of O 3 and HCHO over the model domain because of very few oak trees in this region. Although the paraffinic (PAR) emissions are fairly large, a 20 % reduction of PAR yields only 1. 7 % of HCHO reduction and 2. 7 % reduction of the O 3 peak. The largest reduction of O 3 levels can be obtained by reduced xylene (XYL) emissions. A 20 % reduction of the total anthropogenic VOC emissions leads to 15. 5 % (20. 3 ppbv) reduction of O 3 peak levels over the Milan metropolitan region...|$|E

Meteorology and emissions inventories developed by the Western Regional Air Partnership Regional Modeling Center for regional haze analysis and planning are used to establish an ozone baseline simulation for the year 2002.

This evaluation demonstrates the model’s suitability for subsequent planning, sensitivity, and emissions control strategy modeling. Once the ozone baseline simulation has been established, an analysis of the model results is performed to investigate the regional impacts of oil and gas development on the ozone concentrations that affect the air quality of Class I areas. Results indicate that the maximum 8 -hr ozone enhancement from oil and gas (9. 6 parts per billion [ppb]) could affect southwestern Colorado and northwestern New Mexico.

The study considers that the advective–dispersive transport equation is used for mobile domain, and the solute exchange between two liquid domains is described as the first-order process. A numerical model is developed for the MIM advective–dispersive transport equation including equilibrium sorption and the first-order degradation. Afterward, the numerical model is used to simulate experimental breakthrough curves (BTCs) for transport of chloride and fluoride through heterogeneous soil column using constant, linear, and exponential distance-dependent <b>dispersion</b> <b>models.</b> It is shown that the behavior of concentration profile produced with a constant <b>dispersion</b> <b>model</b> {{is similar to the}} distance-dependent <b>dispersion</b> <b>model.</b> It is found that the constant dispersion and the exponential distance-dependent <b>dispersion</b> <b>models</b> simulate experimental BTCs reasonably well as compared to the linear distance-dependent <b>dispersion</b> <b>model.</b> Hence, the exponential distance-dependent <b>dispersion</b> <b>model</b> is a simple and practical approach to describe the solute transport through the MIM porous media. © 2016 Indian Society for Hydraulics...|$|R
