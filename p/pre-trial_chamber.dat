5|$|On 8 March 2011, <b>Pre-Trial</b> <b>Chamber</b> II issued summonses {{to appear}} for {{all six of}} the {{suspects}} in the two cases. As with the decision to authorise the investigation by the Prosecutor, Judge Hans-Peter Kaul dissented and opposed the issuance of summonses.|$|E

5|$|On 6 November 2009 the ICC Presidency {{assigned}} {{the situation in}} Kenya to <b>Pre-Trial</b> <b>Chamber</b> II and the prosecutor made an application to that chamber for authorisation to open a formal investigation on 26 November. The judges of the <b>pre-trial</b> <b>chamber</b> granted this authorisation on 31 March 2010. The judges who made this decision, Ekaterina Trendafilova, Hans-Peter Kaul and Cuno Tarfusser noted in their written ruling that while Article 15 of the Rome Statute does allow for the Prosecutor to investigate and prosecute a case of his own volition, {{this is one of}} the more controversial aspects of the ICC. In the ICC's history, this case was the first time the Prosecutor decided to investigate a case in this manner, with all prior cases being referred to the Court either by a national government, or by the United Nations Security Council.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Pre-Trial</b> <b>Chambers</b> of the International Criminal Court {{have become}} {{critically}} important to its functioning. This Article identifies the trends that {{cut across the}} decisions of the ICC 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Pre-Trial</b> <b>Chambers.</b> It argues that they have taken a proactive approach to judicial decision-making, analyzing each legal and factual question raised rather than deferring or punting issues to the Trial Chambers. It then explains how the expression of this proactive approach varies depending on whether the Chambers are maintaining, clarifying, or expanding the field of international criminal law...|$|R

40|$|As {{the first}} cases before the ICC {{proceed to the}} Appeals Chamber, the judges ought to {{critically}} evaluate the merits and demerits of the control-theory of perpetratorship and its related doctrines. The request for a possible recharacterization of the form of responsibility {{in the case of}} Katanga and the recent acquittal of Ngudjolo can be taken as indications that the controltheory is problematic as a theory of liability.

5|$|The International Criminal Court's {{prosecutor}} may open {{a formal}} investigation {{in one of}} three circumstances: when a situation is referred by the government of a state which the investigation concerns, when the situation is referred by the UN Security Council or under his own volition with authorisation from a <b>Pre-Trial</b> <b>Chamber.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{outcomes}} of the confirmation of charges hearings were announced on 23 January 2012. Despite the ICC regulations requiring the <b>Pre-Trial</b> <b>Chamber</b> to normally issue a verdict on confirmation of charges within sixty days of the hearings taking place the chamber issued a ruling on 26 October 2011 to vary this time limit to allow both the results in both cases to be announced simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedures}} of the ICC allow for the participation of victims who may submit views and observations to the Court and also apply for reparations. In the case of Ruto et al. 394 victims applied {{to participate in the}} proceedings and the <b>pre-trial</b> <b>chamber</b> admitted 327 of those victims as participants. In the case of Muthaura et al. 249 victims applied and 233 were admitted as participants.|$|E
50|$|In July 2003, ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo {{announced}} that he had received communications from individuals and non-governmental organisation regarding the situation in the Congo and that his office would closely follow developments there. In September of that year Moreno Ocampo informed the Assembly of State Parties (the governing body of the ICC) that he was prepared to apply to one of the ICC's <b>Pre-Trial</b> <b>Chambers</b> for authorisation to begin a formal investigation but that he believed a referral from the Congolese government would expedite the investigation. In April 2004 Joseph Kabila formally referred the situation in the DRC to the ICC prosecutor and Moreno Ocampo formally opened the investigation that June. The DRC investigation was the first ever formal investigation conducted by the International Criminal Court.|$|R
40|$|Copyright @ 2009 University of California PressArticle 30 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court {{provides}} a general definition for the mental element required {{to trigger the}} criminal responsibility of individuals for serious violations of international humanitarian law. At first sight, {{it appears that the}} explicit words of Article 30 are sufficient {{to put an end to}} a long-lasting debate regarding the mens rea enigma that has confronted the jurisprudence of the two ad hoc Tribunals for the last decade, but this is not true. Recent decisions rendered by the International Criminal Court evidence the discrepancy among the ICC <b>Pre-Trial</b> <b>Chambers</b> in interpreting the exact meaning of Article 30 of the ICC Statute. The paper challenges that dolus eventualis is one of the genuine and independent pillars of criminal responsibility that forms, on its own, the basis of intentional crimes, and suggests its inclusion in the legal standard of Article 30 of the ICC Statute...|$|R
40|$|In January 2013, Trial Chamber V of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in {{the cases}} of William Ruto and Joshua Sang and of Francis Muthaura and Uhuru Kenyatta, collectively known as the ‘Kenya decisions’, made a marked {{departure}} from the firm prohibition on ‘witness proofing’ established by the ICC's <b>Pre-Trial</b> and Trial <b>Chamber</b> I in the Lubanga decisions. This reversal illustrates the polarization of an issue that has caused considerable controversy in the international legal community and demonstrates the challenges faced by the Court in navigating such a controversy. While the practice may be viewed as a fault line between two different procedural cultures, forever destined to be subject to debate, this article explores an alternative view, examining the reasons for this turnaround and proposing an approach based on ‘principled pragmatism’. In doing so, it considers whether witness preparation is coming to be regarded as a necessary part of ICC practice...|$|R
5|$|The Kenyan government's {{attempt to}} defer the cases at the ICC by {{appealing}} {{to members of the}} UN Security Council failed without being voted on, however the government, represented by British lawyers Geoffrey Nice and Rodney Dixon, have subsequently applied directly to the Court. The Kenyan government's application to <b>Pre-Trial</b> <b>Chamber</b> II that the two cases were inadmissible was rejected unanimously by the judges. Many victims of the post-election violence voiced opposition to the government's stance, and a poll of Kenyans conducted by Synovate shortly after Moreno Ocampo's announcement that he intended to seek summonses showed that sixty percent of Kenyans supported the trial of the accused taking place in The Hague.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, <b>Pre-Trial</b> <b>Chamber</b> II {{requested}} that the Prosecutor, defendants, and victims comment {{on the possibility of}} holding the confirmation of charges hearings in Kenya rather than in The Hague. This move was supported by Amnesty International, which claimed that holding the hearings in Kenya would bring the justice process closer to victims. The idea of holding the hearings in Kenya was also supported by the defendants Francis Muthaura and Henry Kosgey, with Mathaura suggesting holding the hearings in a military barracks for enhanced security as well as suggesting the possibility of holding the hearings in Arusha, Tanzania, which is the location of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The move was opposed by the Prosecution, who cited security concerns as an obstacle, and also by Ali, Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang who cited the possibility that a change of venue would lead to delays in the trial process in submissions made to the Court. On 29 June Judge Trendafilova ruled that the hearings will take place at the seat of the Court in The Hague.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pre-Trial</b> <b>Chamber</b> II {{ruled that}} there were {{reasonable}} grounds to be believe that William Ruto and Henry Kosgey were criminally responsible as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes outlined in counts 1, 2 and 4, {{but in the case}} of Joshua Sang it ruled that his involvement was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so only ruled {{that there were}} grounds to believe he otherwise contributed to the crimes. The Chamber rejected the request by the Prosecutor to include the charge of torture in count 3. In the case of Kenyatta, Muthaura and Ali the Chamber ruled that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Uhuru Kenyatta and Francis Muthaura were guilty as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes of which they were accused {{but in the case of}} Mohammed Ali, the Chamber ruled that his contribution was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so he was charged with having otherwise contributed.|$|E
40|$|The International Criminal Court (the 				 2 ̆ 2 ICC 2 ̆ 2), {{the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s first {{permanent}} {{international criminal tribunal}}, is the 				first international criminal tribunal to grant to victims the right to 				participate in court proceedings, through their own representatives. This article, which is authored by a former 				ICC trial attorney, examines the ICC 2 ̆ 7 s actual performance in providing victims 2 ̆ 7 				participation in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s first years of operation. The article posits, in part through 				statistical analysis, that the processing of applications to participate is 				consuming substantial Court resources while yielding participation for very few 				victims. The article attributes this 				failing to the readiness of the <b>Pre-Trial</b> and Trial <b>Chambers</b> to expand the 				participation right beyond the boundaries intended by the ICC 2 ̆ 7 s creators, 				without agreeing on the standards for participation. The consequences, the article argues, have 				included the impairment of the efficiency of ICC proceedings, the undermining 				of defense rights, and the inability of most victims to obtain more than a 				theoretical right to participate. The 				article proposes means of strengthening the ICC victims 2 ̆ 7 participation 				framework and suggests ways in which victims and victims 2 ̆ 7 representatives might 				better vindicate the interests of victims of crimes within the ICC 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction...|$|R
5|$|The {{government}} of Kenya and the National Assembly both attempted {{to stop the}} ICC process. The government appealed to both the United Nations Security Council and the Court itself regarding the admissibility of the case. The National Assembly voted in favour of removing Kenya as a state party to the Rome Statute, the international treaty which established the ICC. Despite this opposition, the suspects cooperated with the proceedings and attended preliminary hearings in The Hague in April 2011 and confirmation of charges hearings in September of that year. The <b>Pre-Trial</b> <b>Chamber</b> II confirmed the charges against Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang and declined to confirm the charges against Ali, Kosgey, and Muthaura. The trial of Ruto and Sang began on 10 September 2013, while that of Kenyatta is supposed to begin on 5 February 2014. However the Chief prosecuter has asked that the case be adjourned citing lack of enough evidence required for trial.|$|E

500|$|After failed {{attempts}} {{to conduct a}} criminal investigation of the key perpetrators in Kenya, the matter was referred to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.

2500|$|After {{an arrest}} warrant was issued for the Sudanese {{president}} in March 2009, the Prosecutor appealed to add genocide charges.

The definition adopted by the <b>Pre-Trial</b> <b>Chamber</b> is the definition of the Genocide Convention, the Rome Statute, and some ICTY cases. On 3 February 2010 the Appeals Chamber of the ICC found that the <b>Pre-Trial</b> <b>Chamber</b> had applied [...] "an erroneous standard of proof when evaluating the evidence submitted by the Prosecutor" [...] and that the Prosecutor's application for a warrant of arrest on the genocide charges should be sent back to the <b>Pre-Trial</b> <b>Chamber</b> to review based on the correct legal standard.
