It has been said that radioactivity will kill everyone in a city not killed by the blast of a bomb. That is not true. The effect of atomic radiation need not be fatal at all.

50|$|Milton Friedman {{gave some}} lectures advocating free market {{economic}} policies at the Universidad Católica de Chile. In 1975, {{two years after}} the coup, he met with Pinochet for 45 minutes, where the general “indicated very little indeed about his own or the government’s feeling” and the president asked Friedman to write him a letter laying out what he thought Chile’s economic policies should be, which he also did. To stop inflation, Friedman proposed reduction of government deficits that had increased in the <b>past</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> flat commitment by government that after six months it will no longer finance government spending by creating money. He proposed relief of cases of real hardship among poorest classes. In October 1975 the New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis declared that “the Chilean junta’s economic policy is based on the ideas of Milton Friedman…and his Chicago School”.|$|R

40|$|Both {{machine and}} project {{scheduling}} {{are the subject}} of intensive research activities. A wealth of problem types have been studied over the <b>past</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of exact and suboptimal solution procedures have been developed. It appears that both fields have evolved independently, despite the fact that problems under study have a lot in common. While it is customary to classify machine scheduling problems by a standard three-field classification scheme, project scheduling problems are still identified using rather confusing acronyms. In this paper, we present an integrated classification scheme for resource scheduling, which allows for the unique classification of both machine and project scheduling problems. We hope that the presented integrated classification scheme is a first step towards the unification of research in both the machine scheduling and project scheduling area, which, we believe, may lead to substantial synergies in both areas.

40|$|Satellite {{remote sensing}} {{provides}} useful reconnaissance tool for mapping near-shore bathymetry, characterizing <b>a</b> coastal area <b>and</b> monitoring any seafloor changes {{that may have}} occurred since the last hydrographic survey of the area. At the 2012 Canada Hydro conference, a study was presented on the potential use of Landsat satellite imagery to map shallow-water bathymetry in a GIS environment over three study sites. Since then, several collaborations between the current study group and various hydrographic organizations were established {{with the goal of}} implementing optically-derived bathymetry as part of their data acquiring procedure. Bathymetry over additional study sites around the world was tested. Also, different commercial software packages were evaluated to provide an affordable processing platform for hydrographic offices in developing countries.
