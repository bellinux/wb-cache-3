In a statistical analysis of the frequency with which amino acids appear in different chemical environments in the structures of proteins, free cysteine residues were found to associate with hydrophobic regions of proteins.

Hydrophobicity scales, which rank amino acids from most hydrophobic to most hydrophilic, consistently place cysteine towards the hydrophobic end of the spectrum, even when they are based on methods that are not influenced by the tendency of cysteines to form disulfide bonds in proteins. Therefore, cysteine is now often grouped among the hydrophobic amino acids, though it is sometimes also classified as slightly polar, or polar.|$|E

Classical cadherins mediate adhesion by binding interactions {{that depend on}} their N-terminal extracellular cadherin (EC) domains, which swap N-terminal β-strands.

Xis binds cooperatively to two DNA sites arranged as direct repeats on the phage DNA. Efficient excision is achieved through a cooperative interaction between Xis and the host-encoded factor for inversion stimulation {{as well as}} a cooperative interaction between Xis and integrase. The secondary structure of the Xis protein was predicted to contain a typical amphipathic helix that spans residues 18 to 28.

40|$|The {{ratio of}} the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per site (Ka) over the number of synonymous substitutions per site (Ks) has often been used to detect {{positive}} selection. Investigators now commonly generate Ka/Ks ratio profiles in a sliding window to look for peaks and valleys in order to identify regions under positive selection. Here we show that the interpretation of peaks in the Ka/Ks profile as evidence for positive selection can be misleading. Genic regions with Ka/Ks> 1 in the MRG gene family, previously claimed to be under positive selection, are associated with a high frequency of <b>polar</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> with a high mutability.

Compared to surface positions, polar side-chains at core positions form a greater number of intra-molecular hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, the majority of polar side-chains at core positions form at least one hydrogen bond to main-chain atoms that are not involved in hydrogen bonds to other main-chain atoms. Based on this structural survey, hydrogen bond rules were generated for each <b>polar</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> for use in protein core design. In the context of protein core design, these prudent polar rules were used to eliminate from consideration <b>polar</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> rotamers that do not form a minimum number of hydrogen bonds. As an initial test, the core of Escherichia coli thioredoxin was selected as a design target.

Dead-end elimination was used to identify global minimum energy conformations for the prudent polar and no polar strategies.

Synechococcus strains lacking dmeA or lacking dmeA and expressing Anabaena sepJ were constructed. The Synechococcus dmeA mutant showed a significant 22 to 32 % decrease in the uptake of aspartate, glutamate, and glutamine, a phenotype that could be partially complemented by Anabaena sepJ.
