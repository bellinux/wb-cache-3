40|$|PURPOSES: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{eliminate}} the noise of the vehicle after measuring the friction noise obtained from the NCPX (Noble Close ProXimity) method. The pure friction noise between the tire and road pavement could be determined from filtering the compositeness of sound and the influence of the vehicle noise. METHODS: The noise magnitude could be determined by analyzing the sound pressure level (SPL) and sound power level (PWL) along with the noise frequency of a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) analysis as well as CPB (Constant Percentage Bandwidth) analysis. RESULTS: When the test for measuring the friction noise originated somewhere between tire and road pavement is performed with NCPX method, it must be fulfilled by attaching the surface microphone near the tire. In this condition, the surface microphone can measure the friction noise occurred at between tire and pavement, the chassis noise from the engine and <b>power</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>units,</b> the fluctuating aerodynamic noise, and the turbulence noise directly affected to the surface microphone. By using the NCPX method, the noise occurred at the vehicle must be eliminated for measuring the friction noise between tire and pavement from the traffic noise.

50|$|SSPTS was {{a shuttle}} upgrade that {{replaced}} the Assembly Power Converter Unit (APCU) {{with a new}} device called the <b>Power</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Unit</b> (PTU). The APCU {{had the capacity to}} convert shuttle 28 VDC main bus power to 124 VDC compatible with ISS's 120 VDC power system. This was used in the initial construction of the space station to augment the power available from the Russian Zvezda service module. The PTU adds to this the capability to convert the 120 VDC supplied by the ISS to the orbiter's 28 VDC main bus power. It is capable of transferring up to 8 kW of power from the space station to the orbiter. With this upgrade both the shuttle and the ISS were able to use each other's power systems when needed, though the ISS never again required the use of an orbiter's power systems.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Conventional {{wind power}} plants employ a {{variable}} speed gearbox {{to run a}} generator housed {{on top of a}} tower. A new topology can remove some of the weight from the tower and centralize the wind power generation.

40|$|Real gas effects {{typical of}} the {{critical}} region of working fluids are a powerful tool to increase the energy performances of Stirling cycles, mainly at low top temperatures. To carry out the compression near the critical region the working fluids must have a critical temperature near environmental conditions {{and the use of}} organic working substances (pure or in suitable mixtures) {{as a matter of fact}} begins compulsory. The moderate thermal stability of the organic working fluids limits the maximum temperatures to 300 – 400 °C and as a consequence, the achievable cycles efficiencies result rather low. Carbon dioxide, with a critical temperature of 31 °C, is, among the traditionally inorganic gases, an exception and is considered here in comparison with organic substances. But the good thermodynamics of the cycles allows, in the considered cases, conversion efficiencies of about 20 %, with good specific powers. The good energy performance of real gas Stirling cycles is obtained at the cost of high maximum cycle pressure, in the range of at least 100 – 300 bar. These high pressures nevertheless have large positive effects on the heat <b>power</b> <b>transferred</b> per <b>unit</b> of pumping mechanical power, and the low top temperatures have a positive influence on the material problems for the hottest engine parts...|$|R
40|$|In arc welding, {{energy is}} {{transferred}} from the welding electrode to the base metal by an electric arc. When the welder starts the arc, both the base metal and the filler metal are melted to create the weld. This melting is possi-ble because a sufficient amount of <b>power</b> (energy <b>transferred</b> per <b>unit</b> time) and energy density is supplied to the electrode. Heat input is a relative measure of the energy <b>transferred</b> per <b>unit</b> length of weld. It is an important characteristic because, like preheat and interpass temperature, it influences the cooling rate, which may affect the mechanical properties and metallurgical structure of the weld and the HAZ (see Figure 1). Heat input is typically calculated as {{the ratio of the}} power (i. e., voltage x current) to the velocity of the heat source (i. e., the arc) as follows: where, H = heat input (kJ/in or kJ/mm) E = arc voltage (volts) I = current (amps) S = travel speed (in/min or mm/min) This equation is useful for comparing different welding procedures for a given welding process. However, heat input is not necessarily applicable for comparing different processes (e. g., SMAW and GMAW), unless additional data are available such as the hea...|$|R

40|$|The ZEBRO is a fully {{autonomous}} six-legged robot {{designed for}} swarm behaviour {{and is the}} size of an A 4 sheet of paper. However, there does not exist an charging station for the ZEBRO yet. At this time, the battery still has to be replaced manually, which defeats the purpose of an autonomous system. An autonomous charging station has to be designed to complete the system. The charging station can be split into 3 parts: the autonomous charging station, the wireless power transfer, and the battery management system (located in the ZEBRO). In this particular thesis, the autonomous charging station will be discussed. Since all components in the ZEBRO are built to be modular, the design of the autonomous charging station is chosen to fit this principle. The charging station will consist of one central unit, and several connectable (modular) pads. Each pad will be able to hold and charge a single ZEBRO in 30 minutes. The charging station contains a communication module to communicate its location to ZEBRO's in need of charging. To calculate the locations of the connected pads, a grid will be created by serial communication between the charging station and the connected pads through Raspberry Pi's. (The pads do not have a communication module and do not have their location defined) To power the wireless <b>power</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>unit,</b> a power supply of 48 V and 500 W will be implemented in the charging station. Each pad will consume about 100 W, so a maximum of 4 pads can be connected. (Due to power loss). If more pads need to be connected, an additional power supply can be put in parallel. All separate components have been simulated or tested and do work as predicted. The integration of all components of the charging station was successful as well. At this time, the complete system with the wireless power transfer and battery management system has not yet been put together and so it is unknown if it works as a whole. Zebro Projec...|$|E
