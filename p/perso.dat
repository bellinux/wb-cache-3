5000|$|Because {{the divinity}} is unattested in any old Western Iranian language, {{establishing}} characteristics {{prior to the}} introduction of Zoroastrianism in Western Iran (c. 5th century BCE) is very much in the realm of speculation. According to Boyce, it is [...] "probable" [...] that there was once a <b>Perso</b> - Elamite divinity by the name of [...] (as reconstructed from the Greek [...] ). It is then likely (so Boyce) that it was this divinity that was an analogue of Ishtar, and that it is this divinity with which Aredvi Sura Anahita was conflated. Boyce concludes that [...] "the Achaemenids' devotion to this goddess evidently survived their conversion to Zoroastrianism, and they appear to have used royal influence to have her adopted into the Zoroastrian pantheon." [...] According to an alternate theory, Anahita was perhaps [...] "a daeva of the early and pure Zoroastrian faith, incorporated into the Zoroastrian religion and its revised canon" [...] during the reign of [...] "Artaxerxes I, the Constantine of that faith." ...|$|E
5000|$|Instantly {{recognisable}} as the [...] "tall skinny {{guy with}} glasses," [...] Martin {{was one of}} the most valuable members of the D-Gen as a writer and performer on The Late Show (1992-1993).

Noted for his quick wit and passion for mimicry, Martin also appeared in countless Late Show sketches (including sleazy filmmaker Warren <b>Perso</b> in the classic sketch: The Last Australian Auteur), and provided the voices of Senior Sergeant Bargearse in the serial [...] "Bargearse" [...] (dubbed episodes of Bluey) and Governor Frontbottom and Judge Muttonchops in the serial The Olden Days (dubbed episodes of Rush). Martin compiled all three volumes of The Best Bits of The Late Show with Santo Cilauro and Wayne Marx, and also co-produced the [...] "dangerously overstuffed" [...] double DVD set, The Best Bits of The Late Show: Champagne Edition, which was released in 2001.|$|E
