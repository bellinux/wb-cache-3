5|$|Edward, {{or rather}} {{those who were}} {{wielding}} power on his behalf, also appointed {{a number of new}} ealdormen to positions in Wessex. Little is known of two of these men, {{and it is difficult to}} determine which faction, if any, they belonged to. Edwin, probably ruling in Sussex, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>also</b> parts of Kent and Surrey, was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by Ælfhere. Æthelmær, who oversaw Hampshire, held lands in Rutland, perhaps suggesting links to Æthelwine.|$|E
5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden {{building was}} constructed each year, called Dover Castle, from which gunfire salutes were sounded during the competitions. Competitors were {{summoned to the}} hillside {{by the sound of}} a hunting horn, to take part in various sports. Mounted cannons were fired to begin the events, which included horse-racing, coursing with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, sledgehammer throwing, fighting with swords and cudgels, quarterstaff, and wrestling. Prizes included silver trophies for the mounted sports, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>also</b> money for the other events.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{painting}} lie corpses {{in various states}} of undress. The Destroying Angel was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris in which he had witnessed the July Revolution at first hand, and the sight and smell of the dead in the streets had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in The Destroying Angel were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>also</b> by the cholera epidemic which killed thousands in London in 1832.|$|E

5|$|Assuming for the {{purposes}} of argument, however, that evolution is a religion or religious tenet, the remedy is to stop the teaching of evolution, not establish another religion in opposition to it. Yet it is clearly established in the case law, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>also</b> in common sense, that evolution is not a religion and that teaching evolution does not violate the Establishment Clause, Epperson v. Arkansas, supra, Willoughby v. Stever, No. 15574-75 (D.D.C. May 18, 1973); aff'd. 504 F.2d 271 (D.C. Cir. 1974), cert. denied , 420 U.S. 924 (1975); Wright v. Houston Indep. School Dist., 366 F.

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Gaveston's death, however, civil conflict in England rarely seemed far away, and it is currently believed that Thomas probably intended to create a secure retreat, a safe distance away from Edward's forces in the south. He also probably hoped to erect a prominent status symbol, illustrating his wealth and authority, and challenging that of the King. He may <b>perhaps</b> <b>also</b> have hoped to create a planned town alongside the castle, possibly intending to relocate the population of Embleton there.|$|E
5|$|Small {{bony fishes}} {{are the main}} prey of the nervous shark, while crustaceans, molluscs, and snakes may also be eaten. It is viviparous, with the {{developing}} embryos nourished through a placental connection. The details of its life history seem to vary depending on latitudefor example, {{the timing of the}} breeding season and the length of the gestation period. Females produce litters of one to six young either annually or biennially. The harmless nervous shark is caught incidentally by coastal gillnet fisheries and <b>perhaps</b> <b>also</b> by line and trawl fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species except in Australian waters, where its population seems healthy and has been listed under Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray exhibits aplacental viviparity, with the developing embryos at first receiving nourishment from yolk, and later from histotroph ("uterine milk", enriched with proteins, fat, and mucus) {{produced by the}} mother and delivered through specialized outgrowths of the uterine lining. Mature females have two functional ovaries and uteruses. Reproduction occurs year-round, with males apparently capable of mating every year and females every other year. The gestation period is unknown. Reported litter sizes range from 17 to 20; at least the number of ova, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>also</b> the number of young, increases {{with the size of}} the female.|$|E
5|$|The lion is {{probably}} represented more frequently and diversely {{than any other}} animal. In most forms, the lion has no apotropaic meaning and was merely decorative. However, it sometimes has an astrological or symbolic meaning. One of the popular forms of the lion is explicitly heraldic form, including in the Persian coat of arms (the lion and sun); the animal in the coat of arms of the Mamluk Baybars and <b>perhaps</b> <b>also</b> in that of the Rum Saldjukids {{of the name of}} Kilidi Arslan; and in numismatic representations.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Perseus at Pydna in 168BC, the Roman Senate allowed the reopening of iron and copper mines, but forbade the mining of gold and silver by the four newly {{established}} autonomous client states that replaced the monarchy in Macedonia. The law may originally have been conceived by the Senate due to the fear that material wealth gained from gold and silver mining operations would allow the Macedonians to fund an armed rebellion. The Romans were <b>perhaps</b> <b>also</b> concerned with stemming inflation caused by an increased money supply from Macedonian silver mining. The Macedonians continued minting silver coins between 167 and 148BC (i.e. just before {{the establishment of the}} Roman province of Macedonia), and when the Romans lifted the ban on Macedonian silver mining in 158BC it may simply have reflected the local reality of this illicit practice continuing regardless of the Senate's decree.|$|E
5|$|In September, SAS {{announced}} that if Braathens {{took the first}} step to reduce capacity between Bergen and Oslo, they would follow immediately to reduce the overcapacity in the combined 37 daily departures. However, Braathens was not willing to reduce. On 15 September, Color Air {{announced that}} they would start flying five round trips from Oslo to Stavanger Airport, Sola on 1 October, following the delivery of their fourth aircraft. At the same time, the airline would reduce the number of round trips to Ålesund from four to two. The load factor in August was 43%, and management stated that 50% load would not be sufficient to make money. In particular, the company stated that while aircraft were full during the weekends, the company was not succeeding at garnering the necessary business ridership to fill up the planes during the weekdays. To become more attractive, the company changed its fares to two classes: Business Full Flex and Saver No Flex. The company also stated that to attract more business travelers, it was looking for an international partner to conduct codesharing on international routes, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>also</b> introduce a frequent flyer program alone or in cooperation with the partner.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Martill {{suggested}} that the odontoid {{at the tip of}} the lower jaw of Istiodactylus served to fill the space where no tooth was present. This completed an arc-like bite that would have been necessary to sever morsels that would otherwise remain attached by a thread. Martill stated that few other animals are known with teeth similar to those of Istiodactylus, but pointed out the similarity to various types of sharks and reptiles, including the cookiecutter shark, which takes circular bites from fish as well as prey much larger than itself (including whales). Istiodactylus may also have taken circular bites from prey larger than itself (such as dinosaurs and crocodiles), but <b>perhaps</b> <b>also</b> from fish, for example by snapping at their backs near the water surface. Martill stated that there were many differences between the skull of Istiodactylus and extant scavengers, such as the lack of a sharp, pointed beak, which could have made it less capable of tearing flesh, but the long neck may have provided enough pulling power, and the claws on the fingers may have been used to manipulate carcasses. Martill agreed that Istiodactylus was most likely a scavenger that would have used its robust teeth to scrape meat from bones, as indicated by wear-facets on the tooth-tips (he proposed that scratch-marks should be looked for on dinosaur bones). He also {{suggested that}} if they were scraping away the last flesh from a carcass, like marabou storks, they would have been in the back of the queue for access to it.|$|E

5|$|Shortly afterwards, at 19:30, B Company {{detected}} a North Korean force of around company-size {{preparing for a}} frontal assault, and called-in mortar fire to break up their formations, while a number of forward patrols had to be withdrawn by the Australians {{in order to prevent}} their encirclement. In response the North Koreans fired mortars at the Australian positions with limited effect. Half an hour later North Korean shells hit the 3 RAR battalion headquarters and C Company positions {{on the other side of}} the river, however the rounds landed in the damp soil of the paddy field and failed to explode. Periodically they were also targeted by machine-gun fire, but it was mostly high and posed little threat. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>also</b> under the impression that the Australians had withdrawn, the North Koreans failed to press their attack. Yet they soon realised their mistake and heavy small arms fire began again at 22:30 with North Korean activity against A and B Companies increasing significantly, which resulted in B Company suffering two killed and three wounded. The Australian right flank was now exposed and following a request from Thirlwell, Chitts detached 1 Platoon under Lieutenant John Wathen to bolster B Company. At 23:00 further artillery and mortar fire missions were ordered by the Australians against the North Koreans in response to renewed concentrations in preparation for an assault. Around the same time 8 Platoon C Company under Lieutenant Colin Townsend was sent across the bridge in the darkness to further reinforce B Company, and they dug-in on each side of the road leading to the bridge. Telephone lines had been laid by the Australians to their forward companies, and despite the fighting they remained intact throughout the battle.|$|E
