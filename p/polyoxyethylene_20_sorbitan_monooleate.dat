The results show that the desert soil required bioaugmentation and biostimulation for bioremediation of crude oil. The bioaugmented biopile system led to a total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) reduction of 77 % over 156 days while the system with <b>polyoxyethylene</b> (<b>20)</b> <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> (Tween 80) gave a 56 % decrease in TPH. The biostimulated system with indigenous micro-organisms gave 23 % reduction in TPH. The control system gave 4 % TPH reduction. The addition of Tween 80 led to a respiration rate that peaked in 48 days compared to 88 days for the bioaugmented system and respiration declined rapidly due to nitrogen depletion. The residual hydrocarbon in the biopile systems studied contained polyaromatics (PAH) in quantities that may be considered as hazardous.

In the present study we used small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and deuterated P 80 (d-P 80) to determine the location and concentration of P 80 within the LCNP and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to reveal the internal structure. SANS data suggests that some d-P 80 already penetrates the particle core at 5 %. However, the content of d-P 80 is still low enough not to significantly change the internal Fd (3) over barm structure of the LCNP. At higher fractions of P 80 a phase separation occurs, in which a SPC and P 80 rich phase is formed at the particle surface. The surface layer becomes gradually richer in both solvent and d-P 80 when the surfactant concentration is increased from 5 to 15 %, while {{the core of the}} particle is enriched by GDO, resulting in loss of internal structure and reduced hydration. We have used neutron reflectometry to reveal the location of the stabiliser within the adsorbed layer on an anionic silica and cationic (aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) silanized) surface. d-P 80 is enriched closest to the supporting surface and slightly more so for the cationic APTES surface.

We previously reported that the bioavailability of CoQ 10 powder was less than 10 %. In this study, we investigated various preparations to improve the intestinal absorption of CoQ 10 with focus {{on the effect of}} emulsification. We prepared a suspension and some emulsions with four types of surfactants and investigated the plasma concentration profile after oral administration to rats. The absorption of CoQ 10 was improved by an emulsion formulation although there was little absorption of CoQ 10 when a suspension was administered. However, little CoQ 10 was absorbed in the bile duct-ligated group even when the emulsion formulation was administered (about 50 % of the control group). Bile and emulsion formulation are essential for absorption of CoQ 10. When the preparations containing Tween 20 (polysorbate (20) sorbitan monolaurate) and Tween 80 (<b>polyoxyethylene</b> (<b>20)</b> <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate)</b> were administered, plasma concentrations of CoQ 10 were higher than those obtained with preparations containing Tween 65 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan tristearate) and Span 20 (sorbitan monolaurate). Tween 20 and Tween 80 have higher hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) values than those Tween 65 and Span 20.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the potential of cellulose acetate membrane for preparation of formulated water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) emulsions by repeated premix membrane emulsification. The effects of selective membrane emulsification process parameters (concentration of the emulsifiers, number of passes of the emulsions through the membrane, and storage temperature) on the properties and stability of W/O/W emulsions were also investigated. The preparation of multiple W/O/W emulsions by repeated premix membrane emulsification (ME) using cellulose acetate membrane (0. 8 µm mean pore size) has proposed in this study to reduce low stability problem of the emulsions. A coarse emulsion was passed through the same membrane five times at a constant pressure of 0. 3 MPa to minimize the droplets size and to increase the uniformity of droplets size. About 7 wt. % polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) and 0. 5 - 10 wt. % Tween 80 (<b>Polyoxyethylene</b> (<b>20)</b> <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate)</b> were used as lipophilic and hydrophilic emulsifiers, respectively. In addition, 1, 3, 6, 8 -pyrenetetrasulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (PTSA) was used as a hydrophilic model ingredient for the encapsulation of bioactive substances. By using 7 wt. % PGPR concentration and 0. 5 wt. % Tween 80 concentrations, the most uniform particles with minimum mean size of oil drops (9. 926 µm) were obtained after four passes through the membrane. The encapsulation efficiency greater than 70 % was achieved after emulsions storage at 4 °C for seven days with amount of serum about 41. 02 %.

Samples that form the colloidal regions of both systems were investigated by freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy and by viscosity and conductivity measurements. The three techniques were compared and evaluated as characterisation tools for such colloidal systems and also to identify transitions between the colloidal systems formed A droplet ME was present at a low water volume fraction (phi (w)) in both systems (phi (w) < 0. 15) as revealed by electron microscopy.

Bovine insulin was encapsulated within poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA 50 : 50, Resomer RG 504 H) microspheres by the multiple emulsion-solvent evaporation technique. Microspheres were prepared by adding to the primary emulsion three non-ionic surfactants, poloxamer 188, polysorbate <b>20</b> and <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> 80, at different concentrations (1. 5 and 3. 0 % w/v). The presence of surfactants was found to decrease the mean diameter and to affect the morphology of the microspheres. Insulin encapsulation efficiency was reduced {{in the presence of}} surfactants and especially for <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> 80, in a concentration-dependent mode. The influence of the surfactants on the interactions between insulin and PLGA together with the primary emulsion stability were found to be the major determinants of insulin encapsulation. The release of insulin from microspheres was biphasic, showing an initial burst effect followed by a near zero-order release for all the batches prepared. The initial burst was related to the presence of insulin molecules located onto or near to the microsphere surface. In the presence of surfactants, a faster insulin release with respect to microspheres encapsulating insulin alone was observed. Insulin stability within microspheres after processing, storage and release was evaluated by reversed phase- and size-exclusion-HPLC. The analysis of microsphere content after processing and 6 months of storage showed that insulin did not undergo any chemical modification within microspheres. On the contrary, during the period of sustained release insulin was transformed in a high-molecular weight product, the amount of which was related to the surfactant used. In conclusion, polysorbate 20 at 3 % w/v concentration was the most effective in giving regular shaped particles with both good insulin loading and slow release, and limiting insulin modification within microspheres...|$|R

As clays are primarily silicates, the question arises "Why not apply the same principles to enhance porosity characteristics of other silicates such as clays?" Optimization of reagent concentrations, template choice, synthesis protocol and template removal strategy led to a maximum total pore volume of 0. 95 cm 3 g- 1.

This more than trebled the original total pore volume of Laponite RD, 0. 27 cm 3 g- 1. An increase in modal pore diameter was also observed after use of this template; from 36. 6 A to 52. 3 A. Synthesis of Laponite-like compounds within the laboratory led to enhancement of porosity characteristics without templating; a total pore volume of 0. 44 cm 3 g- 1 was observed for this synthetic hectorite (KP). Use of a template further enhanced the porosity characteristics of these samples.

The DTC peaks I and II have been attributed to the reorientation of free and bound or hydration H 2 O molecules in the emulsion respectively. Evidence has been obtained that DTC peaks III and IV are due to Tween 20...|$|R
40|$|Smegmatocin, {{a protein}} {{produced}} by Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 14468, {{was found to}} have an esterase activity, hydrolyzing Tween 80, polyoxyethylene <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate,</b> added to the assay medium for various "bacteriocins" from mycobacteria. Because M. diernhoferi ATCC 19340 (indicator strain for smegmatocin) is highly susceptible to oleic acid and smegmatocin requires Tween 80 for manifestation of its anti-M. diernhoferi activity, it is likely that smegmatocin-mediated antimicrobial action is caused by oleic acid generated by hydrolysis of Tween 80 by the inherent esterase action of smegmatocin. Other mycobacteriocins from rapidly growing mycobacteria also have inherent esterase activity against Tween 80 and require Tween 80 for expression of antimycobacterial action. Smegmatocin was found to hydrolyze various polyoxyethylene (sorbitan) fatty acyl esters but not <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> and glyceryl esters...|$|R

50|$|The use of biosurfactants {{as a way}} {{to remove}} {{petroleum}} from contaminated sites has been studied and found to be safe and effective in the removal of petroleum products from soil. Other studies found that surfactants are often more toxic than the oil that is being dispersed, and the combination of the oil and the surfactant can be more toxic than either alone. Biosurfactants were not used by BP after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. However, unprecedented amounts of Corexit (active ingredient: dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> (Span 80), and polyoxyethylenated <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> (Tween-80)), were sprayed directly into the ocean at the leak and on the sea-water's surface, the theory being that the surfactants isolate droplets of oil, making it easier for petroleum-consuming microbes to digest the oil.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of coconut oil and different surfactants on stability of nanoemulsions that were prepared by simple homogenization (13, 500 rpm, 10 minutes). Coconut oil, sunflower oil and castor oil at the concentration of 20 - 40 % w/w were used as the oil phase. Polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80 and Cremophore RH 40 were used as surfactant whereas <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> and polyethylene glycol 400 were used as co-surfactants. The formulations containing coconut oil in the range of 20 - 40 % w/w and the ratio of polysorbate 80 to <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> of 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 provided nano-sized emulsions (100 - 500 nm). The zeta potential values ranged from- 41. 51 to- 16. 97 mV. The prepared nanoemulsions were stable for at least 7 days at 8 C. The temperature cycling test (storage at 4 C for 24 hours and at 45 C for 24 hours) was performed. It was found that the formulation containing 30 % w/w of coconut oil, 22. 5 % w/w of polysorbate 80 and 7. 5 % w/w of <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> was stable for 1 cycle. The results indicated that a decrease in the concentration of surfactant and an increase in the concentration of oil affected the stability of nanoemulsions...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of Tween <b>20</b> (<b>polyoxyethylene</b> <b>sorbitan</b> monolaurate) on {{the composition of}} adsorbed protein films in hydrocarbon oil-in-water emulsions containing B-lactoglobulin and a-lactalbumin has been investigated at neutral pH. The kinetics of pol ymerization of adsorbed 13 -lactoglobulin via sulphydryl-disulphide interchange is little affected by Tween 20. Add ing emulsifier after homogenization leads to slightly greater competitive d i splacement of protein from the interface for emul sions made with pure 8 -lactoglobulin than for equivalent emulsions made with 0. -lactalbumin. For emulsions made with the two proteins in a 1 : 1 molar ratio, adding emulsifier after homogeniza t ion leads to more displacement of 8 -l actoglobulin than a-lactalbumin. I n a n emulsion containing both proteins a nd Tween 20 added before homogenization at an emulsifier -toprotein molar ratio of 2 : 1, there i s {{three times as much}} a-lactalbumin adsorbed at the droplet surface as S-lactoglobulin. It appears that the kinetics of compe t itive protein exchange between the bulk phase and the oil-water interface is facilitated by the presence of water-soluble surfactant...|$|R

Certain mycobacteria possess a lipase that splits it into oleic acid and polyoxyethylated sorbitol.

40|$|Emulsifiers {{are used}} in ice cream to produce a dry, smooth {{textured}} product with desireable melting properties. They function by promoting a partial destabilization of the fat emulsion. Polyoxythylene <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> is used very commonly in the ice cream industry for this purpose. The objective {{of this research was}} to examine by transmission electron microscopy the differences in the fat globules in typical ice cream mix emulsions prepared with and without 0. 08 % polyoxyethylene <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate.</b> Ice cream mix was combined 3 : 1 with a 2 % solultion of ultralow gelling temperature agarose at 20 degrees C, fixed with 4 % glutaraldehyde, postfixed with 1 % OsO 4 in imidazole/phosphate buffer, embedded in Spurr resin and thin-sectioned for viewing. The emulsifier reduced the number of casein micelles adsorbed to the fat globules as determined by both TEM and quantification of membrane protein with Kjeldahl analyses. The fat/Serum interfacial tension was also significantly reduced by the presence of emulsifier in the mix. The data suggest that emulsifiers promote fat destabilization through reduction of membrane protein, based on their ability to reduce the fat serum interfacial tension. In the presence of crystallized fat, the emulsion then becomes less stable to shear forces during the whipping and freezing of ice cream...|$|R
