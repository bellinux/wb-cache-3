At 9:35 Beatty signalled 'Engage the corresponding ships in the enemy's line', but Tigers captain, believing that Indomitable was already engaging Blücher, fired at , as did Lion, which left [...] unengaged and able to continue to engage Lion without risk. However, Lion scored the first serious hit of the battle when one of her shells penetrated the working chamber of Seydlitzs rear barbette at 9:40 and ignited the propellant lying exposed. The resulting fire spread into the other turret and burnt out both of them, killing 159 men. Seydlitz returned the damage at 10:01 with a [...] shell that ricocheted off the water and pierced Lions five-inch armour aft, although it failed to explode. However, the resulting [...] hole flooded the low <b>power</b> <b>switchboard</b> compartment and eventually shorted out two of Lions three dynamos. [...] scored the most telling hits on Lion at 10:18 when two [...] shells struck her port side below the waterline. The shock was so great that her captain, Ernle Chatfield, thought that she had been torpedoed. One shell pierced the five-inch armour forward and burst in a wing compartment behind the armour. It drove in a [...] piece of armour and flooded a number of compartments adjacent to the torpedo flat and the torpedo body room. One splinter put a hole in the exhaust pipe of the capstan engine which eventually contaminated the auxiliary condenser with salt water.

At 10:41 a 283mm shell burst against the eight-inch armour of 'A' barbette, but only started a small fire in the 'A' turret lobby that was quickly put out, although the magazine was partially flooded when a false report was received that it was on fire as well. Soon afterwards Lion was hit by a number of shells in quick succession, but only one of these was serious. A shell burst on the nine-inch armour belt abreast the engine room and drove a [...] armour plate about two feet inboard and ruptured the port engine's feedwater tank.

2500|$|On 18 March 2013 at 6:57p.m., {{the cooling}} {{system for the}} spent fuel pools of the No. 1, 3 and 4 {{reactors}} stopped, after the electricity instantaneously went out at the plant's accident response center. TEPCO suspects that the problem was situated in one makeshift <b>power</b> <b>switchboard</b> controlling the cooling system. The injection of water into the Nos. 1, 2 and 3 reactors was not affected. According to TEPCO, restoring the cooling system of the spent fuel pool of reactor No. 4 had the [...] "highest priority", {{because the number of}} fuel assemblies stored in that tank was larger than in the pools of unit 1, 2 and 3. On 19 March at 10 a.m., the temperatures ranged between 15.9 C and 30.5 C, and it would take about four days until the temperature of the water inside the No. 4 spent fuel pool reaches the upper safety limit of 65 C. TEPCO was prepared to inject water into the pool whenever needed in case the water warmed up and started to evaporate. On 19 March around 1:20p.m., one of the two lines forming the cooling system of the No. 4 spent fuel pool was restored. Around 8 p.m. TEPCO was expecting to get the other line in operation. The cooling system of the No. 1 spent fuel pool was put back in action at 2:20p.m. The power loss caused anxiety and questions among residents of the region. The news was communicated by the Nuclear Regulation Authority around three hours after the incident happened. On 22 March 2013, the evacuation zones were to be reclassified, and some residents would be allowed to make day trips to their homes. Some people thought that all was under control, and others with little children were afraid for yet another evacuation. Electricity went out simultaneously at nine facilities of the plant in total, a filter system to remove radioactive materials from cooling water for the reactors, and a cooling system for yet another pool were affected too. TEPCO admitted, that this was the first occasion that such a power failure happened at so critical facilities at the site since the plant was brought under control in December 2011. On 20 March before 1:00a.m. all systems were online again. The cooling system of pool no. 4 was restored as last. TEPCO blamed a provisional <b>power</b> <b>switchboard</b> to be the cause of the troubles. According to TEPCO, this was the last remaining makeshift <b>power</b> <b>switchboard</b> at the plant, installed after the nuclear crisis. Criticism was there from the central and prefectural government, the late announcement three hours after the power loss had caused [...] "significant anxiety" [...] among local people. TEPCO promised that it would seek to communicate relevant information more quickly on issues that could stir public concern. During the investigation to find the cause of the power loss, a 6-inch rat was found electrocuted near a switch board. Further investigations were needed to find out whether this was the only cause.|$|E

40|$|The {{independence}} axiom recommends independence {{among all}} functional requirements. Modern machines, however, are all driven by electrical power and follow commands from computers with algorithms dependent on instrumentation signals; electrical functions interfere with all mechanical functional requirements. Moreover, a typical machine loses its entire function when its single electrical system fails. The Fukushima- 1 accident followed this exact scenario; the tsunami destroyed all <b>power</b> supplies and <b>switchboards,</b> then all pumps and valves turned inoperable {{from the control}} room.

The system includes a differential current relay that senses a current differential between current flowing from secondary windings located in a current transformer coupled to a power supply side of a switchboard, and a total current induced in secondary windings coupled to a load side of the switchboard. When such a current differential is experienced, a current travels through a operating coil of the differential current relay, which in turn, opens an upstream circuit breaker located between the <b>switchboard</b> and a <b>power</b> supply to remove the supply of <b>power</b> to the <b>switchboard...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a slewing crane with electromagnet, operated by three three-phase induction motors but powered from a single-phase <b>power</b> supply. A <b>switchboard</b> drives the motors and the electromagnet. From its seat – {{mounted on the}} crane – an operator can make the crane arm slew left or right. The electromagnet can be moved back, forward, up or down and is capable of lifting 80 kg loads. Crane slewing is limited to an 180 º angle, for safety reasons. Pressing an emergency button switches off all command circuits. An 8051 microcontroller-based system determines the vertical position of the electromagnet, which cannot be switched off while being on a high position, not even if the emergency button is pressed. The crane is made of iron, has a height of 3 m and a length of 2, 5 m. Such proportions make it very suitable for science fair events...|$|R
