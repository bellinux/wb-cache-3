40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the spray forming and downstream processing of Al alloys that are difficult to <b>produce</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> by conventional solidification processing: Al-Fe-Cr-Ti alloys for intermediate temperature applications and Al-Si-Li alloys for high stiffness, low density applications in fast moving machinery. For the Al-Fe-Cr-Ti alloys, spray forming is being investigated to allow the scale-up of alloy compositions previously explored only as ribbons or powders in traditional rapid solidification routes. For Al-Si-Li alloys, spray forming is used to provide globular primary AlLiSi in a fully divorced AlLiSi/alpha-Al eutectic structure. For both alloys, the as spray formed and downstream processed microstructure of 20 kg billets has been investigated by scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, and X-ray diffractometry.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2008. The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to identify the constraints that restrict the development of informal and small formal retailers, and highlight potential opportunities that may assist in strengthening their position within the value chain. It explored the functioning of two municipal-managed static fresh produce markets in KwaZulu-Natal: Durban and Pietermaritzburg. The investigation revealed that informal and small formal retailers have relatively little impact on the fresh produce value chain and that the structure of static markets is not conducive to these groups because of their lack of capital and inability to buy <b>produce</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk.</b> Predominant constraints to their economic growth include high cost of transport, high prices of produce and competition with other traders. In addition, police harassment was identified in Durban as one of the dominant constraints, but was not reflected in Pietermaritzburg. However, opportunities for small and informal retailers to strengthen their position were identified as increasing the market access for retailers, through the provision of transport, informal training workshops, cold storage facilities in the city, the formation of cooperatives and access to micro-credit. This research argues that attention must be given to enhancing the interests and role of small and informal retailers in governance and operational processes within fresh produce markets. The necessity of the development of social networks (also argued by Meagher 1995) is a critical factor in determining the success of informal and micro enterprises and could contribute to institutional reforms that help address the information and access asymmetries in the fresh produce market environment. Following the completion of this dissertation, it was distributed along with the appended log frames to the management at the Durban and Pietermaritzburg, market agents and informal retailer groups that participated. It will also be disseminated through the Learning, Monitoring and Research Facility, who funded part of {{the research}}, and is hoped that the information will aid informal retailers and empower those that were involved...|$|E
40|$|Summary Proprotein convertases (PCs) form a {{group of}} serine endoproteases that are {{essential}} for the endoproteolytic processing of proproteins into their active forms. Some PCs have been proposed to be potential therapeutic targets for cancer intervention because elevated PC activity has been observed in many different cancer types and {{because many of the}} PC substrates, such as pro-IGF- 1 R, pro-TGF-ß, pro-VEGF, are involved in signaling pathways related to tumor development. In this study, we have developed furin-specific nanobodies for the inhibition of furin activity. Antibody-based inhibitors would provide a highly specific strategy for targeted inhibition. Compared to conventional antibodies, nanobodies are 10 times smaller in size but possess the same antigen binding affinity. They are also easy to <b>produce</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> quantities at low costs and to engineer. We have developed and characterised 13 different nanobodies. Four of them, when expressed in mammalian cells, show furin inhibiting capacity. This inhibitory effect is strictly specific for furin. After expression of these four nanobodies in E coli and subsequent purification, their enzyme inhibitory capacities were also evaluated in vitro. It has been demonstrated that they probably inhibit enzyme activity by inducing a conformational change of the enzyme, thereby causing steric hindrance for substrates to enter the catalytic site. Inhibitory activity was found only when large protein substrates were used. No inhibition could be observed when a small fluorogenic peptide substrate was tested. The purified nanobodies showed cell protective effect against diphtheria toxin and anthrax toxin. These effects are valuable and should be investigated further in vivo since it indicates the nanobodies could become valuable anti-bacterial tools. Similarly, they might also constitute valuable anti-viral reagents, since they are likely to inhibit processing of viral envelope glycoproteins critical for infectivity. Purified nanobodies do not lead to the inhibition of furin in the trans-golgi network. A possible explanation for this phenomenon probably lies in their insufficient penetration into cells. On one hand, further studies could focus on improving cell penetration capabilities of the nanobodies, on the other hand, a gene therapy approach might be contemplated using the nanobody cDNA since overexpression of nanobodies in mammalian cells led to promising inhibitory effects regarding the maturation of substrates which {{have been shown to be}} important in cancer development, for example pro-TGF-ß and pro-GPC 3. In this study, we also evaluated small molecule polyphenols as potential furin inhibitors. We have chosen polyphenols for several reasons. Firstly, they are food components or food additives. Therefore, they are not likely to cause deleterious effects in the general population. Secondly, many of them have been claimed to exert anti-cancer effects. Several polyphenols have been evaluated by other research groups. Majumdar and co-workers (Majumdar et al, 2010), for instance, reported about in vitro inhibitory activity towards furin and the authors consequently suggested that the anti-cancer effects of these polyphenols might be related to their furin inhibitory activity. Our attempts to measure the furin inhibitory effect of a series of polyphenols resulted in confirmation of the in vitro furin inhibition. However, these inhibitory effects could not be substantiated in living cells undermining the furin inhibition basis for the anti-cancer claim. The in vitro fluorimetric assay, therefore, leads to results that not always have a predictive value for the in vivo situation. The in vitro test thus easily leads to false positive results. In the present study, the false positive effects of the main component of green tea (-) EGCG on the PC furin were studied in greater detail. It was first demonstrated that the false positive effects were not related to aggregation of the polyphenols. Detergent-based enzyme assays are in use to limit false positive effects related to enzyme unfolding caused by adsorption of the enzyme to aggregating small molecules. Furthermore, polyphenols in solution, such as catechins, may form reactive compounds when exposed to air and these can bind to enzymes with enzyme inhibition as a result. This should be taken into account in screening assays. Adding reduced glutathione to the detergent-based assay, as used in these studies, to measure furin processing activity strongly reduced inhibition by a number of polyphenols (catechins, gallic acid, and quercetin), while the effect on the genuine inhibitor nona-D-arginine remained unchanged. In conclusion, the combined use of detergent and glutathione in an in vitro screening assay for furin inhibitors improves the predictive value. Besides improving the in vitro assay, in this study, we have further investigated the possible indirect inhibitory effect of polyphenols against endogenous furin activity in a cellular environment. Six out of twenty-seven different polyphenols appear to inhibit furin indirectly in such an assay. The inhibitory effects of four compounds were further evaluated. All four compounds appeared to inhibit zymogen maturation and consequently PC activity. The molecular mechanism for the inhibitory activity of one of them, curcumin, was elucidated at the subcellular level in experiments with mammalian cells. We demonstrated that curcumins inhibitory effect on Ca 2 + uptake into the ER by the enzyme sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase (SERCA) allows and is sufficient to explain the inhibitory effect on PC activity. The inhibition of PC activity by all four compounds resulted in a reduction of anchorage-independent growth (a hallmark of malignancy) of cancer cells in culture. Targeted drug delivery approaches could reduce potential deleterious side effects in therapeutic use. In this study, we have therefore evaluated a nanoparticle drug carrier for its potential for targeted drug delivery. Magnetic nanoparticles (MPs) loaded with an anti-tumor drug, in combination with external magnetic field (EMF) -guided delivery, can improve the efficacy of treatment and may decrease side effects. Our results show that our simple and adaptive nanoparticle design may accommodate chemotherapy for drug delivery optimization. This could also increase the margin of safety in future treatment of solid tumors with furin inhibitors. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT	I INDEX	V LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS	VII 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION	 1 1. 1.
