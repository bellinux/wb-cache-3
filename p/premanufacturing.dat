However, development is not at its end. Computer support of process planning is a further step towards total integration of <b>premanufacturing</b> activities...|$|E
40|$|Section 5 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) {{does not}} require any {{toxicity}} testing as a prerequisite for submission of a <b>Premanufacturing</b> Notice (PMN) for a new chemical. In order {{to compensate for the}} lack of actual test data, a process involving structure-activity relationships (SAR) for assessing hazard potential was constructed. The hazard assessment is then coupled with an estimation of potential exposure to determine potential risk. This process involves the use of multiple interdisciplinary teams that work within a 90 -day time frame to complete approximately 2000 risk assessments per year...|$|E
40|$|Act (TSCA), which {{requires}} the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to assess potential toxic effects {{of new and}} existing chemicals, structure-activity relationships (SAR) analysis has been extensively and effectively used {{in the identification of}} potential health hazards of new (<b>Premanufacturing</b> Notification) industrial chemicals (Arcos, 1983; Auer and Gould, 1987). To evaluate the potential health hazards of the large number of existing chemicals for which adequate test data are not available, SAR analysis has been given an increasing role as a basis for recommending additional testing, for designing strategic research plans in TSCA programs, and for setting priorities of testing environmental pollutants such as disinfection byproducts in drinking wate...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} need and market for {{temporary}} buildings for various purposes, including largeconstruction projects in the tourism and events sectors or in civil protection. This paper gives an overview about the useof reusable lightweight materials in temporary buildings. Based on a project proposal submitted to the 7 th framework, anew concept of temporary buildings is proposed. This concept combines {{the advantages of the}} <b>premanufacturing</b> of asmall number of parts and wooden components and a flexible and modular erection of the temporary building. Thefocus is on fast establishment with a maximum of three persons. A flexible and modular extension is possible. Assembling and disassembling the individual components with novel connect systems, adapted from the furnitureindustry, is proposed. This project aims to bring these concepts into new temporary buildings with new, reusable, and flexible lightweightdesign...|$|E

We performed an SLCA and used the AT&T matrix and Delphi-technique to compare a 1990 s era automobile(made in china) to one from the 2000 s of China. From the comparison, we calculated 5 life stages of automobile production include <b>premanufacturing,</b> product manufacture, product delivery, product use and recycling. The comparison shows moderate environmental stewardship during resource extraction, packaging. The ratings during manufacturing and refurbishment / recycling / disposal are both poor, and during customer use are abysmal though it have some improvement. The overall rating of 1990 s is far below what might be desired. In contrast, the overall rating for the 2000 s vehicle is much better than that of the earlier vehicle but still leaving plenty of room for improvement...|$|E
40|$|Circuits using nano-meter {{technologies}} {{are becoming increasingly}} vulnerable to signal interference from multiple noise sources as well as radiation-induced soft errors. One way to ensure reliable functioning of chips {{is to be able}} to analyze and identify the spots in the circuit which are susceptible to such effects (called "soft spots" in this paper), and to make sure such soft spots are "hardened" so as to resist multiple noise effects and soft errors. In this paper, we present a scalable soft spot analysis methodology to study the vulnerability of digital ICs exposed to nano-meter noise and transient soft errors. First, we define "softness" as an important characteristic to gauge system vulnerability. Then several key factors affecting softness are examined. Finally an efficient Automatic Soft Spot Analyzer (ASSA) is developed to obtain the softness distribution which reflects the unbalanced noise-tolerant capability of different regions in a design. The proposed methodology provides guidelines to reduction of severe nano-meter noise effects caused by aggressive design in the <b>premanufacturing</b> phase, and guidelines to selective insertion of online protection schemes to achieve higher robustness. The quality of the proposed soft-spot analysis technique is validated by HSPICE simulation, and its scalability is demonstrated on a commercial embedded processor...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{arc welding}} {{techniques}} used in shipbuilding {{are characterized by}} high heat input resulting in a large extent of set-up, straightening and adjustment operations. This also complicates subsequent outfitting work. The need for lightweight structures leads {{to the development of}} new design solutions, better exploiting material properties while enhancing the operational behaviour. Laser welding techniques both reduce heat distortions and allow for new structural solutions. The project aims at the development and exploitation of laser welded sandwich panels in the shipbuilding industry. Emphasis was put on the following aspects: Installation of a prototype laser welding station and development of the welding process. Development of a quality assurance system and qualification of the panels. Investigations on operational properties of sandwich panels and development of design solutions. Assembly and subsequent manufacturing processes for sandwich panels in a shipyard environment. Laser welded sandwich panels have already been used in newbuilding ships. e. g. by Meyer Werft, and in other industries. Due to their improved properties and modulare <b>premanufacturing</b> techniques sandwich panels are competitive against conventional stiffened plates. (orig.)
