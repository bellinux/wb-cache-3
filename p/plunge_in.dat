5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 9th century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much-diminished city of Tikal, as {{evidenced}} by a stela erected in the Great Plaza by Jasaw Chan K'awiil II in 869. This was the last monument erected at Tikal before the city finally fell into silence. The former satellites of Tikal, such as Jimbal and Uaxactun, did not last much longer, erecting their final monuments in 889. By the end of the 9th century the vast majority of Tikal's population had deserted the city, its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple thatched dwellings were being erected in the city's ceremonial plazas. The squatters blocked some doorways in the rooms they reoccupied in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non-utilitarian items such as musical instruments. These inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities, far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them. Some monuments were vandalized and some were moved to new locations. Before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared, with the tombs of the North Acropolis being explored for jade and the easier-to-find tombs were looted. After 950, Tikal was all but deserted, although a remnant population may have survived in perishable huts interspersed among the ruins. Even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the 10th or 11th centuries and the rainforest claimed the ruins for the next thousand years. Some of Tikal's population may have migrated to the Peten Lakes region, which remained heavily populated in spite of a <b>plunge</b> <b>in</b> population levels in the first half of the 9th century.|$|E
25|$|When the {{speculative}} bubble popped Spain {{became one of}} the worst affected countries. According to Eurostat, between June 2007 and June 2008, Spain has been the European country with the sharpest <b>plunge</b> <b>in</b> construction, with actual sales down an average 25.3%. So far, some regions have been more affected than others (Catalonia was ahead in this regard with a 42.2% sales plunge while sparsely populated regions like Extremadura were down a mere 1.7% over the same period).|$|E

25|$|The Libyan economy depends {{primarily}} upon {{revenues from}} the oil sector, which accounts for 80% of GDP and 97% of exports. Libya holds the largest proven oil reserves in Africa and is an important contributor to the global supply of light, sweet crude. Apart from petroleum, the other natural resources are natural gas and gypsum. The International Monetary Fund estimated Libya's real GDP growth at 122% in 2012 and 16.7% in 2013, after a 60% <b>plunge</b> <b>in</b> 2011.|$|E

He left China through Xiamen in early February 1937 at the age of 19. He worked for his uncle as a carpenter in the first two years, learning the Malay language in the meantime. After gaining experience he {{went on to become a}} building sub-contractor and completed his first job of building a two-storey school. He returned to Anxi in 1940, but went back to Malaya the next year amidst a deteriorating war environment.|$|E

25|$|The real {{exchange}} rate appreciated through 1981 and 1982, public sector investment rose 54 percent {{in real terms}} from 1979 to 1982, and public sector consumption rose 25 percent during the same three-year period. The combination effectively turned the current-account surplus into a large deficit, as increased spending plus import liberalization practically doubled imports {{of goods and services}} between 1979 and 1981. The appreciation also turned manufacturing exports back downward, and a <b>plunge</b> <b>in</b> external prices of primary exports brought them down too. And then the mistake of focusing on the earlier export surplus as the main cause of inflation became clear: the increases in spending led to a leap of inflation despite the return to an external deficit. The rate of inflation went from 59 percent in 1980 to 111 percent by 1983.|$|E
25|$|In October 1999, Raytheon was {{the subject}} of a number of {{securities}} class action lawsuits alleging it had issued a series of materially false and misleading statements including overstating the company's 1997 and 1998 revenues, concealing cost overruns and inflating its financial results. The suits were brought in response to a massive drop in value of Raytheon's common stock as traded on the New York Stock Exchange. On Tuesday, October 12, 1999, Raytheon shares traded at about 45% below their level on October 11, 1999. The <b>plunge</b> <b>in</b> stock prices was triggered by a Wall Street Journal report that Raytheon was over cost or behind schedule on more than a dozen fixed-price defense contracts. This crash represented a loss of about $8 billion in market value in a single day. On May 13, 2004 Raytheon reported that it had reached a preliminary agreement to pay $410 million in cash and securities to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging it misled investors by not disclosing difficulties on various Pentagon and construction projects five years before.|$|E
25|$|The ringgit would {{experience}} more acute plunges {{in the value}} since mid-2014 following the escalation of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal that raised allegations of political channeling of billions of ringgit to off-shore accounts, and uncertainty from the 2015–16 Chinese stock market turbulence {{and the effects of}} the 2016 United States presidential election results. The currency's value fell from an average of 3.20 to the US dollar in mid-2014 to around 3.70 by early 2015; with China being Malaysia's largest trading partner, a Chinese stock market crash in June 2015 triggered another <b>plunge</b> <b>in</b> value for the ringgit, which reached levels unseen since 1998 at lows of 4.43 to the US dollar on September 2015, before stabilising around 4.10 to 4.20 to the US dollar soon after; the currency would finally plummet and hover below the 1998 lows since November 2016, between 4.40 and 4.50 to the US dollar, {{in the wake of the}} victory of pro-protectionist Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election, which has raised questions of United State's participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (which Malaysia is a signatory of, and the United States had promptly pulled out from in January 2017) and Malaysia–United States trade as a whole (as the United States is among Malaysia's largest trading partners).|$|E

25|$|Chief {{economist}} for Japan at Credit Suisse, Hiromichi Shirakawa, {{said in a}} note to clients that the estimated economic loss may be around $171 billion–$183billion just to the region hit by the quake and tsunami. On 14 March, the Bank of Japan, {{in an attempt to}} maintain market stability, injected 15trillion yen into the money markets to assure financial stability amid a <b>plunge</b> <b>in</b> stocks and surge in credit risk. After it set up an emergency task force to ensure liquidity {{in the aftermath of the}} disaster, governor Masaaki Shirakawa and the bank's board also enlarged a programme to buy government bonds to exchange-traded funds to the tune of 10trillion yen. The BOJ chief told reporters cash injections will continue as needed. However, following the further nuclear leaks, its actions were read by the market as insufficient despite 8trillion yen being pumped into the market. On 15 March, the Topix index fell again marking a two-day plunge not seen since 1987 as Japan's default risk surged after Prime Minister Naoto Kan warned of further leaks from the damaged nuclear power plant. Commodities were also significantly lower. Residents of Tokyo were reported to have gone on panic shopping sprees as daily necessities were sought after and gasoline was stocked up with the increasing risk of radioactivity releases.|$|E

These developments led in turn to a <b>plunge</b> <b>in</b> US oil import requirements (moving closer to energy independence), a record volume of worldwide oil inventories, and a collapse in oil prices that continued into early 2016.|$|E

2500|$|Insatiable {{received}} generally mixed to unfavourable {{reviews from}} music critics. Aggregating website AnyDecentMusic? reports {{a rating of}} 5.6 based on eight reviews. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music felt that it [...] "does tend to skitter across [...] {{a fine line between}} Heartfelt and A Bit Dim [...] in quite a distracting fashion", but noticed that its [...] "quirks and idiosyncrasies are wrapped up in immaculately produced, grown-up pop music, hand-tooled by experts" [...] and called it [...] "lively and enjoyable in lots of ways". Tony Clayton-Lea from The Irish Times wrote that [...] "it’s nothing we haven’t heard before, but as femme-pop goes, it’s a belter". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian called it a [...] "hook-filled record" [...] of [...] "sumptuous pop and Motownish melodies", but felt that it [...] "doesn't make more of [...] voice" [...] and concluded by stating that [...] "she needs to <b>plunge</b> <b>in</b> properly if she's going to be a viable solo star". Sam Wolfson of NME felt that the album sounds [...] "anachronistic" [...] but praised the absence of auto-tune, saying that [...] "it’s a pleasant reminder that pop homogeneity isn’t compulsory and most songs are fine without a guest slot from Flo Rida and a massive drop every nine seconds". [...] James Berry of Yahoo! Music noticed that Coyle's [...] "budget didn't stretch as far as cutting edge production" [...] but ultimately described the album as [...] "a consistent, strutting and reasonably on the button pop record". Charlotte Heathcote from Daily Express wrote that Insatiable [...] "holds its own [...] but its pop-by-numbers approach lacks the individuality to stand out in a marketplace saturated with expensively produced pop" [...] and noticed that [...] "it squanders [...] killer ingredient: that belter of a voice".|$|E
